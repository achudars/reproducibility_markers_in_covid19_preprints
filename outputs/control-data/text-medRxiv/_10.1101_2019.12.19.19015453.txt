SUMMARY

Objective: Seizure unpredictability is rated as one of the most challenging aspects of living
with epilepsy. Seizure likelihood can be influenced by a range of environmental and
physiological factors that are difficult to measure and quantify. However, some generalizable
patterns have been demonstrated in seizure onset. A majority of people with epilepsy exhibit
circadian rhythms in their seizure times and many also show slower, multiday patterns.
Seizure cycles can be measured using a range of recording modalities, including self-reported
electronic seizure diaries. This study aimed to develop personalized forecasts from a mobile
seizure diary app.
Methods: Forecasts based on circadian and multiday seizure cycles were tested pseudoprospectively using data from 33 app users (mean of 103 seizures per subject). Individual’s
strongest cycles were estimated from their reported seizure times and used to derive the
likelihood of future seizures. The forecasting approach was validated using self-reported
events and electrographic seizures from the Neurovista dataset, an existing database of longterm electroencephalography that has been widely used to develop forecasting algorithms.
Results: The validation dataset showed that forecasts of seizure likelihood based on selfreported cycles were predictive of electrographic seizures. Forecasts using only mobile app
diaries allowed users to spend an average of 62.8% of their time in a low-risk state, with
16.6% of their time in a high-risk warning state. On average, 64.5% of seizures occurred
during high-risk states and less than 10% of seizures occurred in low-risk states.
Significance: Seizure diary apps can provide personalized forecasts of seizure likelihood that
are accurate and clinically relevant for electrographic seizures. These results have immediate
potential for translation to a prospective seizure forecasting trial using a mobile diary app. It
is our hope that seizure forecasting apps will one day give people with epilepsy greater
confidence in managing their daily activities.

INTRODUCTION
Medically refractory epilepsy is a condition associated with persistent uncertainty. Most
people with epilepsy report that, regardless of seizure frequency, it is the unpredictability of
when seizures will occur that is the most debilitating aspect of their condition 1. A forecast of
seizure likelihood could provide immense benefits to people with epilepsy, especially for
those with refractory seizures. Over 30% of all people with epilepsy cannot control their
seizures with medication 2 and, for decades, new drugs have mostly failed to improve overall
rates of seizure freedom 3. Surveys have shown that seizure forecasting is considered a highly
attractive management option by people with uncontrolled seizures 1. At the same time,
epilepsy research has uncovered numerous factors affecting seizure likelihood from longterm trends in behavioural, environmental and physiological data. For example, some people
are more prone to seizures due to stress 4, poor sleep 5, exercise 6, diet 7, weather 8, alcohol
use 9, poor drug adherence

10

and a multitude of other factors. Investigating the utility of

these seizure risk factors and developing personalised forecasting devices is now a key goal
for clinical epilepsy management 1.

The first prospective clinical trial of seizure forecasting in humans used an intracranial
implant to record long-term, continuous electroencephalography (EEG)

11

. Using the same

data, subsequent studies have improved the accuracy of seizure forecasts

12,13

. A key

development has been the understanding that seizure onset is modulated by patient-specific,
cyclic patterns 14–16. The rhythmic nature of epilepsy has been well documented for centuries;
however, it has only recently become clear that an individual’s seizure cycles can be used to
develop personalized forecasts of future seizure likelihood

13,14,17,18

. Although changes in

EEG signal characteristics provide the clearest biomarker to track cycles of seizure likelihood
16,18,19

, it is possible to measure individual cycles using only self-reported seizure diaries

15

.

Therefore, for some people, seizure diaries alone may provide a clinically useful forecast of
future high or low seizure risk periods.

It is now recognised that estimating the probability of someone having a seizure in the near
future is more feasible than trying to predict the exact timing of their next seizure

12,17,20

.

There are increasing efforts to develop a clinical seizure forecasting device 1 and understand
user requirements

21–23

. Patient surveys have confirmed that probabilistic forecasts are

considered useful and that perfect accuracy is not a requirement of such devices

21,23

. For

practical reasons, externally worn devices are rated more desirable than implanted recording

and other physiological

have also been used to forecast seizure

likelihood. It is possible that these non-cerebral biomarkers of seizure likelihood are useful
because the same fundamental rhythms that modulate many aspects of human physiology
also drive seizure risk.

This study used long-term, self-reported data from a mobile seizure diary to determine
whether seizure cycles can provide a useful forecast of future seizure likelihood. The results
provide a proof-of-concept that forecasting seizure cycles is practical and accurate and has
the potential to be used as a clinical management tool. Mobile tools to forecast seizure cycles
have wide-ranging applications including for improved clinical trial design, treatment
titration and long-term management for people with epilepsy.

METHODS

Data
This study used long-term data from a mobile seizure diary app (Seer Medical) to develop
and test seizure forecasts. Forecasts were also generated using only the self-reported events
from the Neurovista dataset, an existing set of long-term, continuous EEG and seizure
annotations that has been widely used to develop forecasting algorithms

11

. The Neurovista

dataset enabled forecasts based on self-reported seizures to be evaluated against
electrographic seizures, and also provided a comparison of non-invasive forecasting
performance to state-of-the-art seizure prediction.

Mobile app data
The Seer app is a freely available mobile diary for reporting seizures and medications.
Currently, there are over 500 active users. This study used a subset of 33 users with a clinical
epilepsy diagnosis, at least 30 reported seizures (mean 103 seizures), and at least 2-months
recording duration (mean 42 weeks). Although users can report information such as seizure
type and duration, this study only used the times of reported seizures. This study was

approved by the St Vincent’s Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC LRR
165/19).

Continuous EEG data
The Neurovista study collected continuous intracranial EEG data from 15 subjects for a
period of 6 months to 2 years. Further information on data collection and participants are
reported by Cook et al (2013). This study only used the seizure times reported during the 6
month – 2 year recording periods. Electrographic seizures were automatically annotated by
an onboard EEG-based detection algorithm. All seizure detections were confirmed by trained
epileptologists. Self-reported events were based on diaries kept by participants and
caregivers, which were subsequently combined with EEG annotations and stored as
electronic records. In addition to diary data, the Neurovista device included an audio
recording feature that was automatically activated when suspect epileptiform EEG activity
was detected by the onboard algorithm. The audio recordings were used to aid confirmation
of clinical seizures; and, for some subjects, audio recordings provided substantial assistance
in seizure detection. However, to provide a direct comparison with mobile app data, the
current study primarily considered events based on participants’ diaries. The human research
ethics committees of the participating institutes approved the Neurovista study and
subsequent amendments. All patients gave written informed consent before participation.

Forecasting seizure cycles

Figure 1. Schematic of seizure forecasting method. A. Development of forecasts initially required
at least 20 seizure times to be reported in the mobile app. B. Self-reported seizure times were
represented as cyclic histograms with different periods. The strongest fast and slow cycles were
estimated based on the synchronisation index of seizure histograms. In the example, a 24 hour and 7
day cycle are shown. C. The estimated seizure likelihood was calculated by combining the fast and
slow cycles. High and low risk forecasts (dashed red and green lines) were optimised based on
historical data.

An overview of the forecasting method is shown in Fig. 1. An individual’s strongest
circadian (“fast”) and multiday (“slow”) cycles were estimated from their reported seizure
times using the magnitude of the resultant vector, or synchronisation index (SI), measured
over a range of potential cycle periods. The synchronisation index is given by:



1
SI    e ౤ ,
N


where N is the total number of seizures and each seizure is represented as a vector on the unit
circle, e ౤ . The angle, θ , ranges from 0 to the period of the cycle being estimated; i.e., 24
hours for a circadian cycle. For this study, fast cycle periods were assumed to be between 6
hours and 48 hours, with a 6-hour increment; i.e. the strongest cycles were selected from 8
candidate periods (6,12,18, 24, 36, 42 and 48 hours). This range of fast cycle periods enabled
the detection of approximate daily cycles rather than true circadian rhythms. Slow cycles
were assumed to have periods of greater than 3 days, with a maximum allowed period of 2
months or 1/5 of the recording duration (whichever was lowest). For instance, a person with
10 weeks of data could have a maximum slow cycle of 2 weeks, whereas someone with 1
year of data could have a slow cycle of up to 2 months. The increment for slow cycles was 1
day; i.e. the strongest cycles were selected from candidate periods of [3 days, 4 days, 5 days,
…] up to the maximum allowed period. Only significant cycles were used to develop seizure
forecasts. Significance was assessed using the Rayleigh test for non-uniformity of circular
distributions (p < 0.05) 32.

Individuals’ strongest cycles were iteratively updated with each new seizure based on an
exponentially weighted history of past seizure times; i.e., the sum for the synchronisation
index of N seizures became:

High and low risk warning thresholds were computed using a pseudoprospective brute force
optimization that maximized the time spent in low risk periods and number of seizures
classified in high risk periods 18.

Forecasts were updated every hour and evaluated pseudoprospectively, using only the
historical seizure record to compute the likelihood of future seizure occurrence. At least 10
seizures were required to initiate the seizure forecast, which was then iteratively updated after
each seizure. Only the lead seizure within each 1 hour window was used, subsequent seizures
within the same hour were removed before calculating and evaluating forecasts. Performance
was evaluated based on the percentage of seizures in high (low) risk and the total duration
spent in high (low) risk, after setting optimal thresholds for high and low risk warnings. A 5
minute intervention period was used for evaluation; i.e., seizures were only considered to be
correctly predicted if the high risk warning was on for at least 5 minutes before onset. Note
that because seizure likelihood was calculated hourly, this intervention period effectively
meant that if a seizure occurred less than 5 minutes past the hour, the high risk threshold
needed to be exceeded in the previous hour to be considered a true positive. Seizures more
than five minutes past the hour were assessed as true positives if the high risk threshold was
exceeded within the same hour. Sensitivity improvement over chance was calculated based
on the proportion of seizures and time in high risk to assess whether the high risk forecast
sensitivity was significantly better than chance performance 34.

Performance was also measured using the receiver-operating characteristic (area under the
curve, AUC). The AUC addresses the ability of a classifier to discriminate between inter-ictal
and pre-ictal data and is the preferred measure for many studies benchmarking multiple
seizure forecasting algorithms

34

. The AUC was also used to assess the significance of

forecasting performance compared to chance level forecasting. Significance was tested using
95% confidence intervals of the AUC using 1000 bootstrap replicas (using perfcurve in
MATLAB). The AUC was compared between actual and random forecasts using nonoverlapping confidence intervals (a conservative measure) and the one-tailed t-test (p < 0.05).

RESULTS

Can people self-report their seizure cycles?
We had previously demonstrated that seizure cycles can be measured from self-reported
seizure times 15. The current study presents a retrospective validation that self-reported cycles
correspond to true underlying epileptic rhythms, rather than just forecasting behavioural
cycles governing when individuals are more or less likely to report their seizures. The
Neurovista dataset was used to determine whether self-reported seizure cycles aligned with
cycles derived from electrographic seizures.

Figure 2. Alignment of seizure cycles based on self-report and EEG for the Neurovista cohort.
Each circular histogram shows the circadian distribution of seizure cycles based on self-reported
events (light blue) and electrographic seizures confirmed by expert reviewers (black line). Total
seizure numbers for each subject are given above each plot (with self-reported event counts in
brackets). Subject 7, had significantly different cycle distributions using Kuiper’s test for circular
distributions (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.01). Subjects 2, 3 and 5 did not have enough self-reported events
for a comparison to be made.

Fig. 2 shows that 11 out of 15 Neurovista subjects (73%) had circadian cycles that were not
significantly different using self-reported (diary) events compared to electrographic seizures
(p > 0.05 using Kuiper’s test for circular distributions). Three subjects (S2, S3, and S5) did
not have enough diary events to make a comparison. Nine subjects (60%) had multiday
cycles that were not significantly different using diaries compared to electrographic seizures
(see supplementary Fig. S1). This suggests that although participants vastly underreported the
total number of seizures, the underlying circadian and multiday trends can still be
determined. There was a preference for individuals to report less seizures at night
(supplementary Fig. S2). In comparison, audio confirmations were higher at night and lower

during the day, perhaps reflecting less background noise during the night. In general audio
confirmations improved the alignment of circadian rhythms (supplementary Fig. S3). Overall,
these data suggest that self-reported seizures identified clinically relevant cycles for most
people with epilepsy, albeit based on a relatively small validation cohort with refractory,
focal epilepsy.

Fig. 3 shows a comparison of forecasting performance using either self-reported (diary) or
electrographic seizures from the Neurovista cohort. Both forecast models were evaluated
using electrographic seizures. This comparison provided a unique opportunity to benchmark
the performance of forecasts based on self-reported seizures against confirmed electrographic
seizures, ensuring that forecasts were not merely useful at predicting users’ reporting habits.
This benchmarking is critical to provide confidence in the clinical utility of forecasts based
on mobile diaries alone.

Forecasts were developed for subjects with at least 30 seizures (11 subjects had >30
electrographic seizures, eight subjects had >30 self-reported seizures). Using electrographic
seizures to develop forecasts resulted in a mean time in high risk of 20.5%, with 59.5% of
seizures occurring in this state. The mean time in low risk was 55.6%, with 13.0% of
seizures. However, when just self-reported seizures were used to develop forecasts, several
individuals showed a marked decline in forecasting performance. Based on self-reported
forecasts, four of the eight Neurovista subjects showed performance not significantly
different from random performance (p > 0.05 using the sensitivity improvement over chance
metric) for high risk warning states. The other half of the subjects fell solidly within the low
or high risk clusters. This result shows that forecasts based on self-reported events may
provide an accurate forecast of the likelihood of clinical electrographic seizures for
approximately half of the cohort, while the other half of this group would produce inaccurate
self-report forecasts.

day (x-axis). Red indicates times when the high risk warning would be activated, green indicates time
when the low-risk warning would be activated and white shows times when the warning was

marked as red asterisks (in this data three seizures occurred during low risk periods). Note that
individuals were not shown the output of their forecasts, and these data represent an example of
pseudoprospective results only.

We tested whether a seizure forecasting model developed from self-reported seizures could
be used to forecast future self-reported events using the mobile app diary data. Fig. 4 shows
an example of what forecasting seizure likelihood looked like using data recorded via the
mobile app. The individual shown had an average of 2.8 seizures per week. Over the year of
pseudo-prospective evaluation, their forecast showed 18.7% of the time in high risk, with
most seizures (59.3%) reported in this state. The individual’s forecast showed 55.1% of the
time in low risk and 10 of their seizures (8.9%) occurred during low-risk periods. The rest of
the time (26.2%) was spent in the moderate risk state. Supplementary Fig. S4 shows two
other examples of subjects with different forecasting outcomes. The supplementary examples
show that diary forecasts can provide useful information for individuals with a range of
seizure rates, including an individual with a lower reported rate of 1.4 seizures per week who
had no seizures occurring during low risk periods, as well as a subject with a high rate of 24.2
seizures per week.

B. Percentage of time in low risk (x-axis) compared to the proportion of seizures in low risk states (yaxis) reported. A good forecast is near the lower right corner, indicating maximal time in low risk

Fig. 5 shows forecasting performance based on mobile app data. It can be seen that using
mobile diaries, the mean high risk accuracy was 64.5% with users spending a mean of 16.6%
of their time in high risk. The mean time in low risk was 62.8% with an average of 9.7% of
seizures occurring during low risk states. Seven of the 33 app users (21%) had zero reported
seizures during their low risk periods. All forecasts were significantly better than chance (p <
0.05 using the sensitivity improvement over chance metric). It is important to note that these
results were evaluated based on self-reported seizures and may not reflect the performance if
all electrographic seizures were recorded. However, the results suggest that clinically useful
forecasts can be developed from mobile data alone, although it is anticipated that, for
approximately half of people, mobile forecasts will not be accurate for predicting
electrographic seizures, as shown from the Neurovista validation cohort (Fig. 3).

of 1000 permutations. Note that, for clarity, the confidence intervals are not plotted although these
were used to calculate the significance of AUC scores.

Fig. 6 shows the rate of true positive compared to false positive predictions for different
thresholds of high risk warnings using mobile app data. Area under the curve (AUC) provides
a measure of forecasting performance without explicitly setting a warning threshold, where
AUC greater than 0.5 indicates performance is better than chance level. Importantly, 95%
confidence intervals can be computed for each AUC value, to show whether results were
significantly better than a random forecast. Across the cohort, the mean AUC was 0.85 (range
of 0.69 to 0.94). All individuals had AUCs that were significantly better than chance
performance (95% confidence intervals were non overlapping and p < 0.05 using a two
sample t-test).

DISCUSSION

It is well known that seizure diaries are inaccurate and not well correlated to true seizure rates
11,36

. The presented results showed that, although diaries are an unreliable estimate of true

seizure counts, they can be used to measure underlying epileptic rhythms (Fig. 2). Because
seizure cycles are repetitive, diary data can be treated as a noisy, undersampled representation
of these underlying patterns. In this way, many people’s seizure rhythms were reliably
measured from their diaries and could be used to forecast clinical electrographic seizures
(Fig. 3). Underreporting and a slight bias towards daytime reporting did not abolish overall
cyclic trends, and the use of audio confirmation increased the number of recorded seizures
and improved the estimation of seizure cycles (supplementary Figs. S2 and S3). Some
subjects reported almost no seizures, which could reflect many possible factors, including
post-ictal memory impairment, the available social support, or the subject’s level of
engagement and attention to detail during the study. On the whole, the retrospective
validation of self-reported forecasting performance against electrographic seizures (Fig. 3)
suggested that seizure forecasting apps will be accurate and may be a clinically useful
method for some people. Future work will focus on incorporating objective biomarkers of
seizures from wearable devices and validating the clinical utility of the proposed seizure
forecasting app in a prospective clinical trial.

Overall the presented results showed that seizure diary apps have the potential to provide
accurate, clinically useful, personalized forecasts of seizure likelihood. Forecasting results
using seizure diaries showed state-of-the-art performance, with an average AUC of 0.85 (Fig.
6). A recent Kaggle competition for seizure prediction using continuous intracranial EEG
recorded from three subjects in the Neurovista cohort reported winning AUC results of 0.81
for the competition and 0.75 on the held-out dataset

13

. Of course, these scores are not

directly comparable to app forecasts, as they were derived from continuous intracranial EEG
data with highly accurate seizure labelling; however, the comparison serves to highlight what
is considered top range performance in seizure prediction using advanced machine learning.
The current study showed forecasting accuracy of 65%, with app users spending, on average,
less than one fifth of their time with a high risk warning (16.6%). A study using deep learning
with the Neurovista data reported an average sensitivity of 69% and time in warning of 27%

. Moreover, forecasts based on seizure cycles naturally provide insight into times of low

seizure likelihood. In this study, users were able to spend, on average, over half their time in
a low risk state. Less than 10% of reported seizures occurred during the low risk state and
20% of users had no seizures in this state. Of course, it should be reiterated that this study
only evaluated performance from users’ self-reported events. It is anticipated that around half
of the cohort would only show chance level performance for their electrographic seizures
(Fig. 3). However, the same forecasting strategy showed similar forecasting performance for
both diary data and electrographic seizures (Figs. 3 and 5). Therefore, performance is
expected to improve as more accurate records of individuals’ seizures becomes available, for
instance through new wearable or implantable technologies. Furthermore, there are
applications for forecasts of self-reported events, such as scheduling EEG monitoring, or
improving analysis of clinical trial diaries 38.

Delivering seizure forecasts in a prospective trial is itself non-interventional in the sense that
no direct therapy is given. Instead, users are only given information about their personalized
seizure likelihood. However, reliable information may be a powerful antidote to the
uncertainty of living with uncontrolled seizures. Furthermore, information about seizure
likelihood can be used in conjunction with behavioural strategies to reduce seizure rates. For
instance, it has recently been shown that stress management techniques could be targeted to
days of heightened seizure risk to reduce seizure rates 39. Forecasts may also be used to
modulate medication or stimulation levels based on seizure likelihood. Such modulating
chronotherapy has been used to time dosage of anti-seizure medication, successfully reducing

seizure rates 40. However, modulation of drug levels has not been investigated for
individually tailored cycles or over longer timescales to account for multiday cycles of
seizure likelihood. Seizure forecasting systems may also improve seizure detection and
prediction accuracy by incorporating data from wearable or implantable monitoring devices.

Wearable devices have long been heralded as the next frontier in epilepsy management, both
for their potential as automated seizure detectors and to provide advance warning of seizure
onset 24. However, wearable seizure monitors have faced several challenges, including their
relevance for more subtle seizure types, high false alarm rates and poor user experience 22,41.
A forecasting app could potentially improve the detection performance of wearable devices
by providing a prior probability of seizure likelihood. Similarly, physiological signals
recorded from wearable devices could improve forecasts of seizure cycles by providing a
continuous measure of underlying rhythms, rather than discrete samples (seizure times). We
have shown that fast and slow cycles of brain activity can be measured from continuous EEG
across diverse frequencies and regions of cortex

18

. These continuous cycles provided the

most accurate estimate of seizure likelihood to date. More recently, cycles of interictal
epileptiform were also used to provide a forecast of seizure risk over days

19

. It is possible

that cycles of epileptic brain activity can also be derived from auxiliary systems modulated
by the brain, such as cardiac and pulmonary output or even mood and sleep. It is well known
that both circadian and multiday cycles modulate many aspects of human health and disease
42–44

, including heart disease

45,46

, immune response

47

and neurological and psychiatric

disorders 48,49. However, a long-term study to identify cyclic rhythms of physiological signals
in conjunction with cycles of seizure risk has not yet been undertaken. Ultimately, the ability
to measure cycles from almost every biological process underscores the power of a simple,
cyclic seizure forecast.

There is still no consensus on how accurate a seizure forecast must be in order to be clinically
useful, nor for which epilepsy characteristics and patterns forecasting methods may prove
most useful. Several studies have surveyed the views of people with epilepsy and caregivers
on the subject of seizure forecasting. In one survey, participants reported that missed seizures
were considered worse than false alarms, and that perfect accuracy was not considered a
requirement for a forecasting device

21

. Recently, Janse et al. (2019) showed that seizure

forecasting devices were acceptable despite the potential for inaccuracy (up to “inaccurate
30% of the time”). Ultimately, post-hoc studies and surveys can only provide an indicative

measure of the utility and benefits of a seizure forecasting device. In a prospective setting,
some people may find knowing times of safety to be more important than high risk warnings.
Some people are likely to tolerate false alarms poorly, whereas others would find a
forecasting device very helpful. As with many aspects of epilepsy treatment, the usefulness of
seizure forecasting is likely to be patient specific.

This study provided a proof-of-concept that seizure diary apps can provide a personalized
forecasts of seizure likelihood. We hypothesise that mobile apps to forecast cycles of seizure
likelihood have the power to improve quality of life for people with epilepsy, even without
delivering direct intervention. In support of this hypothesis, we note that unpredictability is
the primary disability of epilepsy 1 and, for people with refractory seizures, quality of life is
far more strongly determined by the degree of drug-related side effects or depressive
symptoms than by seizure frequency

50

. Reliable seizure forecasting has the potential to

improve quality of life by reducing uncertainty and improving mood. There is also scope for
forecasting to reduce drug related side effects through intelligent titration of medication.
Ultimately, it is our hope that seizure forecasting apps provide another clinical tool to manage
epilepsy.
