Abstract
Background: Dermatophyte infections have undergone unprecedented changes in India in
recent past. Clinical trials comparing effectiveness of 4 main oral antifungal drugs are not
available. We tested effectiveness of oral fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and
terbinafine in chronic and chronic-relapsing tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei.
Methods: Two hundred microscopy confirmed patients were allocated to 4 groups,
fluconazole (5mg/kg/day), griseofulvin (10 mg/kg/day), itraconazole (5mg/kg/day), and
terbinafine (7.5mg/kg/day), by concealed block randomization and treated for 8 weeks or
cure. Effectiveness was calculated based on intention to treat analysis.
Results: At 4 weeks, 4, 1, 2, and 4 patients were cured with fluconazole, griseofulvin,
itraconazole and terbinafine, respectively (P=0.417). At 8 weeks, 21 (42%), 7 (14%), 33
(66%) and 14 (28%) patients were cured, respectively (P=0.000); itraconazole was superior to
fluconazole, griseofulvin and terbinafine (Pâ‰¤0.016). Relapse rates after 4 and 8 weeks of cure
in different groups were similar. Numbers-needed-to-treat (NNT) (versus griseofulvin),
calculated based on cure rates at 8 weeks, for itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine were
2, 4 and 8, respectively.
Conclusion: In view of cure rates and NNT, itraconazole is the most effective drug, followed
by fluconazole (daily), terbinafine and then griseofulvin, in chronic and chronic-relapsing
dermatophytosis in India.

Introduction
Unprecedented changes in the epidemiology, clinical features and treatment responsiveness
of dermatophyte infections have been noted in recent past in India, with many patients
presenting with chronic and chronic relapsing tinea.1-4 Recent data show that terbinafine,
once a highly effective drug, now has an abysmal cure rate of 30.6% in tinea corporis, tinea
cruris and tinea faciei when given orally at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks.5 Decreased
effectiveness of terbinafine has been attributed to mutation in the squalene epoxidase gene.6, 7
In the present study, we compared the effectiveness of four oral antifungal drugs,
fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine, for the treatment of chronic and
chronic relapsing tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei by performing a pragmatic, open,
randomized controlled trial.
Materials and Methods
Setting
The study (registered with Clinical Trials Registry-India, registration number
CTRI/2017/04/008281) was conducted at a tertiary care centre after obtaining approval from
the Institutional Ethics Committee.
Sample size
A sample size of 35 patients in each group was calculated considering the cure rates of 30%
and 70%, with type I error rate of 0.05, type II error rate of 0.1 and dropout rate of 20%.8
Selection criteria and enrolment
Patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris or tinea faciei or any combination of these conditions
were included in the trial. Inclusion criteria were (a) clinical suspicion of tinea corporis, tinea
cruris or tinea faciei, (b) microscopic confirmation of tinea (potassium hydroxide [KOH]

microscopy), (c) age between 4 years and 80 years, and (d) chronic and chronic-relapsing
tinea (duration of tinea 3 months or more or tinea which was present for 3 months or more,
got apparently improved within this period, but relapsed within a month).9 All these criteria
had to be met for inclusion of a patient in the trial. Exclusion criteria included (a) pregnancy,
(b) lactation, (c) presence of any other type(s) of tinea, e.g., onychomycosis, (d) history of
drug reaction or allergy to any of the four drugs, (e) inability to come for follow-up every 2
weeks, (f) presence of any other disease requiring systemic therapy, and (g) abnormal results
in complete blood count (CBC), liver function test (LFT), renal function test (RFT), plasma
glucose (fasting and 2 hour post prandial test), glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C), fasting
lipid profile (FLP), urine routine and microscopy examination (urine R/M), and
electrocardiogram (ECG). Presence of any of the above exclusion criteria made a patient
ineligible for the trial. A witnessed, written and informed consent was given by the patients,
or by a parent in case of minor patients. All female patients of child bearing age were advised
to avoid pregnancy during treatment.
Two hundred patients, who fulfilled the selection criteria, were randomly allocated to 4
parallel treatment groups on the basis of random numbers generated online using Research
Randomizer (https://www.randomizer.org/). Random sequence was generated by block
randomization and each group had 50 patients (allocation ratio 1:1:1:1). Allocation was
concealed using sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes, which contained the
allocation code written on a folded paper, the envelopes were opened after enrolment of the
patients. Both random sequence generation and allocation concealment were done by a
person unrelated to the trial. Patients were enrolled from April 2017 to March 2018. Skin
scrapings taken at enrolment were inoculated on Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (SDA) with
cycloheximide (0.05 g/l) and chloramphenicol (0.005 g/l). Identification of the dermatophyte
was done based on colony morphology and microscopic morphology.

Treatment
Doses given to the patients were as follows: fluconazole (5 mg/kg/day), griseofulvin (10
mg/kg/day), itraconazole (5 mg/kg/day), and terbinafine (7.5 mg/kg/day). Patients also
received antihistamines (levocetirizine 5 mg in morning and hydroxyzine 25 mg at night and
corresponding lower doses in children). Patients were asked to bring used strips of medicines
and those in use at each visit. They were reminded to take the medicines as prescribed at each
visit and received the treatment for 8 weeks or cure, whichever occurred earlier. Patients were
advised against using any other treatment.
Follow-up
Following data were recorded for each patient: body surface area (BSA) affected, treatment
given, microscopy results, investigations at baseline and subsequent follow-ups, and followup data. The most severe lesion was identified as the index lesion, from which scraping and
KOH microscopy was performed at baseline and then at follow-up visits.
Investigations performed at baseline in all groups were as follows: blood pressure
measurement, CBC, LFT, RFT, plasma glucose fasting and post-prandial, HbA1C, ECG,
FLP, urine R/M, blood pressure. During follow-up visits following investigations were
performed: Fluconazole (CBC, RFT, FLP, ECG 4, 8 weeks; LFT 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks),
Griseofulvin (CBC, LFT 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks; RFT, urine R/M 4,8 weeks), Itraconazole (CBC,
RFT, FLP, urine R/M, ECG 4, 8 weeks; LFT 2, 4, 6, 8 weeks), and Terbinafine (CBC, LFT 2,
4, 6, 8 weeks).Patients were followed up at 2 weekly intervals up to a maximum of 8 weeks
or cure, whichever occurred earlier. Patients who were not cured were treated outside the trial
as follows: patient who were on itraconazole were prescribed terbinafine and patients on
terbinafine, fluconazole, or griseofulvin were prescribed itraconazole.

Measurement of treatment effect
Cure was defined as occurrence of both clinical cure (complete clearance of lesions) and
mycological cure (negative KOH microscopy). Presence of post-inflammatory
hyperpigmentation at the site of healed tinea was not considered a feature of tinea. Any of the
following was considered treatment failure: (a) no improvement or worsening of the disease
in 4 weeks in patientâ€™s assessment, (b) presence of scaling and/or erythema at 8 weeks, and
(c) positive microscopy at 8 weeks. Patients who were cured were asked whether they were
fully satisfied with the treatment outcome or not.
Outcome measures
Number of patients cured at 8 weeks with the different regimens was the primary outcome
measure. Secondary outcome measures included number of patients cured at 4 weeks, relapse
rate, and frequency of adverse events.
Assessment for relapse
Those patients who were cured were assessed again 4 and 8 weeks after the cure to look for
relapse of tinea (reappearance of erythema and scaling at the site of healed tinea).
Statistical analysis
For the baseline variables, mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and range were
calculated depending on the distribution of data. Cure rates and relapse rates were compared
by Fisherâ€™s exact test or Chi-square test, as appropriate. Cure rates with different drugs were
calculated on the basis of intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis. P values less than 0.05 were
considered significant. All P vales are two-tailed. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) of treatment
failure at 8 weeks with fluconazole, itraconazole and terbinafine (versus griseofulvin) and

number needed to treat (NNT) were calculated. When appropriate, 95% confidence intervals
(CI) were calculated. Denominator for calculation of relapse rate was the number of patients
who had achieved cure, those cured patients who could not be followed up were considered
relapsed.
Results
Baseline characterises of the patients
Patients in the 4 groups were comparable at baseline with regard to age, weight, duration of
illness and body surface area (BSA) affected [Table 1]. Out of 200 patients, 158 were male
and 42 were female. Majority of the patients (98, 49 %) had tinea cruris et corporis, followed
by tinea cruris et corporis et faciei (57, 28.5%), tinea cruris (28, 14%), tinea corporis (8, 4%),
tinea cruris et faciei (3, 1.5%), tinea corporis et faciei (4, 2%) and tinea faciei (2, 1%).
Cultures for dermatophytes were attempted in 83 patients, of whom dermatophytes grew in
28 cases. In all these cases, the dermatophyte was Trichophyton mentagrophytes.
Cure rates at 4 weeks
In the fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine groups, 4, 1, 2 and 4 patients
were cured, respectively. Cure rates were not significantly different (P=0.417, Fisherâ€™s exact
test) [Table 2, Figure 1] (intention to treat analysis).
Cure rates at 8 weeks
In the fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine groups, 21, 7, 33 and 14 patients
were cured respectively [Table 2, Figure 1]. There numbers include the number of patients
who were cured at 4 weeks. At least one pair of groups was significantly different for cure
rates at 8 weeks (P=0.000, Chi-square test) (intention to treat analysis).
Six different pairs of the treatment groups were compared for cure rates at 8 weeks [Table 3].
Itraconazole was more effective than fluconazole, griseofulvin and terbinafine. Fluconazole

was more effective than griseofulvin. Fluconazole and terbinafine, and griseofulvin and
terbinafine had similar effectiveness. All cured patients were fully satisfied with the outcome.
Number needed to treat
Numbers needed to treat (NNT) (versus griseofulvin), calculated on the basis of cure rates at
8 weeks, for itraconazole, fluconazole and terbinafine were 2, 4 and 8, respectively [Table 4].
Adverse effects
Adverse effects were noted only in the itraconazole group in 2 male patients, in both the
treatment was stopped. One patient developed pityriasis rosea-like rash on day 13 of
treatment, the rash resolved in 2 weeks after stopping treatment. Another patient had
asymptomatic increase in hepatic transaminases (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 68
units/litre, serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase 127 units/litre) at 4 weeks. He was seen 2
weeks later, when he was clinically normal, but he did not repeat liver function tests. Patients
in the other groups experienced no adverse effects and none were detected on investigations.
Relapse rates
At 4 weeks, 2, 0, 2, and 1 patients relapsed in fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole, and
terbinafine groups, respectively (P=0.420, Fisherâ€™s exact test). Relapse rates after 8 weeks of
cure in different groups were also not significantly different (P= 1.0, Fisherâ€™s exact test)
[Table 5, Figure 1].
Discussion
Present study was conducted in view of unprecedented changes in the epidemiology, clinical
features and treatment responsiveness of tinea infections in recent past in India.1-4 This has
led to an epidemic of altered dermatophytosis characterized by chronic and chronic-relapsing
cases.9 Recent data show that terbinafine, once a highly effective drug, now has abysmal cure

rate in tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei.5 These results confirmed the general
impression among Indian dermatologists that terbinafine is fast losing its effectiveness. There
is also a general impression that effectiveness of other antifungal drugs has also declined,
however, there is no published data on the effectiveness of oral antifungal drugs in
dermatophytosis performed during the current epidemic in India.
We tested the effectiveness of oral fluconazole (5mg/kg/day), griseofulvin (10 mg/kg/day),
itraconazole (5mg/kg/day) and terbinafine (7.5mg/kg/day) for the treatment of tinea corporis,
tinea cruris and tinea faciei of 3 months or more. The trial was conducted within a pragmatic
setting. Two hundred microscopy confirmed patients were assigned to the 4 treatments by
concealed random allocation and treated for 8 weeks or cure, whichever occurred earlier.
At 4 weeks, the four treatments were similarly ineffective. At 8 weeks, 21, 7, 33 and 14
patients were cured with fluconazole, griseofulvin, itraconazole and terbinafine, respectively.
Itraconazole was superior to fluconazole, griseofulvin and terbinafine, and fluconazole was
superior to griseofulvin. Numbers needed to treat (NNT) (versus griseofulvin), calculated
based on cure rates at 8 weeks, for itraconazole, fluconazole, and terbinafine were 2, 4 and 8,
respectively, meaning thereby that, compared to griseofulvin, 2 patients need to be treated
with itraconazole to achieve one additional cure, while 4 and 8 patients need to be treated
with fluconazole and terbinafine for the same effect, respectively. Thus, itraconazole was the
most effective treatment out of the four treatments tested in the study.
Relapse rates after 4 and 8 weeks of cure in different groups were not significantly different.
Of the 200 patients, only 2, who received itraconazole, experienced adverse effects, one
developed pityriasis rosea-like eruption and another had asymptomatic elevation of hepatic
transaminases. However, the importance of closely monitoring liver enzymes cannot be
overemphasized when treating patients with itraconazole.

The recently published study from India on patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea
faciei showed that cure rate with terbinafine (5 mg/kg/day) given for 4 weeks was 30.6%.5 In
the present study, cure rates with terbinafine (7.5mg/kg/day) were 8% at 4 weeks and 28% at
8 weeks. These data suggest that effectiveness of oral terbinafine in tinea has declined further
compared to the very recent data. However, this cannot be definitively commented upon
because the present study was not designed to find out effectiveness of a single agent, which
would require a larger sample size.
A limitation of the present study is that it was not blinded.
Clinical trial is the final arbiter on the effectiveness of a drug. In this pragmatic study, the
objective was to compare the effectiveness of 4 commonly used oral antifungal drugs for
tinea infections in a real-world setting, so that the results are relevant and applicable to how
patients with tinea are treated in usual care. To conclude, in view of cure rates and NNT,
itraconazole was the most effective drug for the treatment of tinea corporis, tinea cruris and
tinea faciei, followed by fluconazole (daily), terbinafine and then griseofulvin in the current
epidemic of dermatophytosis in India.
