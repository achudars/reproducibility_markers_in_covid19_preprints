A BSTRACT. Existing methods to infer the relative roles of age groups in epidemic transmission can
normally only accommodate a few age classes, and/or require data that are highly specific for the disease being studied. Here, symbolic transfer entropy (STE), a measure developed to identify asymmetric transfer of information between stochastic processes, is presented as a way to determine
which age groups drive an epidemic. STE provides a ranking of which age groups dominate transmission, rather than a reconstruction of the explicit between-age-group transmission matrix. Using
simulations, we establish that STE can identify which age groups dominate transmission, even when
there are differences in reporting rates between age groups and even if the data is noisy. Then, the
pairwise STE is calculated between time series of influenza-like illness for 12 age groups in 884 US
cities during the autumn of 2009. Elevated STE from 5-19 year-olds indicates that school-aged children were the most important transmitters of infection during the autumn wave of the 2009 pandemic
in the US. The results may be partially confounded by higher rates of physician-seeking behaviour
in children compared to adults, but it is unlikely that differences in reporting rates can explain the
observed differences in STE.

and other age-related interventions, like the selective closure of schools [15, 16, 17]. However,

8

data with sufficient resolution to identify detailed epidemiological relationships between age groups

9

has so far been scarce, and even when such data exist, current methods are insufficient for reliably

10

uncovering those relationships.

11

Electronic medical records (EMRs) help address the issue of data scarcity by providing high-

12

volume influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence data with detailed age structure [18]. EMRs are rou-

13

tinely produced by physicians for insurance purposes during the majority of outpatient visits in the

14

United States [18]. Since EMRs generally contain syndromic illness classifications, EMR-based

15

estimates of influenza incidence are subject to noise from non-ILI respiratory infection. EMR-

16

based disease incidence estimates are also subject to geographic and demographic variation in

17

physician-seeking behaviour. Laboratory-confirmed influenza cases, as collected routinely by the

18

Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) [19], provide more specific estimates of in-

19

fluenza incidence, but at substantially lower volume. Influenza incidence estimates from online

20

search platforms and social media websites like Google [20] and Twitter [21] can provide massive

21

amounts of data, but these sources’ reliability has been called into question, and they lack detailed

22

age information [22]. Dedicated online platforms such as FluNearYou in the US and FluSurvey in

23

the UK, which gather reports of ILI symptoms from community volunteers [23, 24], hold some

24

promise for supplementing traditional ILI data streams [25, 26, 27], but represent a relatively small

25

convenience sample of the population. So, while other data sources exist, EMRs offer a relatively

26

promising and so-far underutilised source of fine-scale data on influenza incidence in the United

27

States [18, 22].

28

Previous attempts to infer the relative importance of different age groups for the transmission of

29

influenza have sought to either reconstruct the explicit next-generation matrix (NGM) [3, 28, 29]

30

or to infer the relative risk of infection between age groups [4]. The NGM-based methods have

31

only been applied to scenarios with at most two age groups (children and adults), in part because

32

they require strong assumptions about the structure of the next-generation matrix which become

33

increasingly unrealistic as the number of age classes grows. The relative risk method [4] has been

34

used to rank the importance of five age groups for the transmission of influenza, but requires data

35

with high specificity for influenza, effectively precluding ILI datastreams and the use of EMRs in

36

particular.

STE REVEALS THE AGE STRUCTURE OF PANDEMIC INFLUENZA TRANSMISSION

3

37

Symbolic transfer entropy (STE) [30] offers a way to infer the relative transmissive importance of

38

possibly many age groups from ILI data. STE is an extension of transfer entropy (TE) [31], which

39

measures the amount of information the past states of one stochastic process provide about the

40

transition probabilities of another. Intuitively, the TE is a measure of the amount of information

41

“transferred” from one stochastic process to another. To compute the STE, a time series is sym-

42

bolised using a scheme that encodes its qualitative structure in a low-dimensional space, and then

43

the TE is calculated from the relative frequencies of these symbols. The symbolisation scheme

44

makes the STE robust to minor point-wise noise and to systematic shifts in amplitude, which in the

45

context of EMR ILI data might arise from the presence of non-influenza ILI cases and from differ-

46

ences in reporting rate between age groups. These benefits come with the trade-off of requiring

47

relatively large amounts of data compared to existing methods for inferring the age structure of

48

disease transmission. STE has been used to study epileptogenic neural signals and the dis-

49

semination of information through social networks [30, 32], but to our knowledge has not been

50

systematically evaluated as a means of providing insight into infectious disease transmission. TE

51

and STE are similar to other model-free methods that measure shared information and so-called

52

‘causal’ relationships between stochastic processes, including mutual information [31], Granger

53

causality [33], and convergent cross mapping [34]. Permutation entropy, a related measure, has

54

recently been used to quantify the predictability of infectious disease outbreaks [35].

55

Here, we use influenza-like outbreak simulations to demonstrate that STE reliably identifies the

56

age groups that drive influenza transmission. Then, we utilise an EMR-based dataset capturing

57

ILI incidence from 884 ZIP (postal) codes and 12 age classes across the United States to rank

58

the relative importance of the various age groups in the transmission of the autumn wave of the

59

2009 A/H1N1pdm influenza pandemic in that country. We conclude that school-aged children

60

(5–19 year-olds) were disproportionately responsible for transmitting influenza to infants through

61

working-age adults in the autumn of 2009, in broad agreement with other findings. Our work

62

demonstrates that STE could serve as an important tool for the detailed epidemiological analysis

63

of age structure, especially as EMR data become more prevalent.

66

forms submitted by primary care physicians across the US and maintained by SDI health (now

IQVIA). Each claim is associated with a single outpatient visit, and includes one or more ICD-9

68

codes [36] listed by the physician that describe the patient’s illness. The overall sample is thought

69

to capture over 50% of all outpatient visits in the US in 2009 [18]. The records are binned weekly

70

and aggregated geographically by the first three digits of the ZIP (postal) code of the practice from

71

which they are submitted [37]. These three-digit ZIP codes will be referred to simply as ‘ZIPs’ (not

72

to be confused with the finer five- or ten-digit ZIP codes, also assigned to many mailing addresses

73

in the US [36]). Time series of weekly influenza-like illness (ILI) incidence are created by extracting

74

claims with a direct mention of influenza, or fever combined with a respiratory symptom, or febrile

75

viral illness (ICD-9 487-488 OR [780.6 and (462 or 786.2)] OR 079.99), following Viboud et al.

76

(2014) [18]. For each ZIP, the number of ILI cases in each week is divided by the total number

77

of patients who visited a physician in that ZIP during that week, yielding an ‘ILI ratio’ time series.

78

There are 884 ILI ratio time series, one for each ZIP in the lower 48 US states, each spanning

79

52 weeks from the week commencing 4 Jan 2009 through the week commencing 27 Dec 2009.

80

The correspondence between the SDI-ILI dataset and reference influenza surveillance data from

81

the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is described in depth by Viboud et al.

2.2. Symbolic transfer entropy. If I and J are discrete-state and discrete-time random pro-

84

cesses such that it and jt are the states of processes I and J at time t, then the transfer entropy

bits. The sum is over all possible combinations of states (it+1 , it , jt ), where it+1 , it

89

jt ∈ ΩJ , and ΩI and Ωj are the state spaces for processes I and J. Eq. 1 is a Kullback-Leibler

90

divergence that measures how much process I deviates from the generalised Markov property

91

p(it+1 |it , . . . , i1 ) = p(it+1 |it ), given the last l states of process J. In practice, the histories are

92

often fixed at length 1 (k = l = 1) and the probabilities are estimated from simple counts of the

93

observed data [31].

STE REVEALS THE AGE STRUCTURE OF PANDEMIC INFLUENZA TRANSMISSION

94

The TE is limited in that it is only defined for stochastic processes with a discrete state space.

95

Staniek and Lehnertz (2008) [30] introduce symbolic transfer entropy (STE) as a way to calculate

96

information transfer between time series processes that have continuous- or near-continuous state

97

spaces. Motivated by the insight that the relative amplitudes of subsequent observations from

98

these sorts of processes may provide enough information to reveal interactions between them,

99

they propose symbolising the time series based on ordered m-tuples of observations (Fig. S1).

100

This reduces the (near-)continuous state space of the original stochastic process to a discrete set

101

of m! symbols. In practice, m is often chosen to be 2 or 3, giving a state space of 2 or 6 symbols,

102

respectively. For m = 3, we also tested the effect of collapsing the two concave-up and the two

103

concave-down symbols into a single symbol each, resulting in a smaller state space (four vs. six

104

symbols) while capturing a similar level of qualitative detail. Details on the symbolisation of time

105

series and the empirical calculation of the STE are provided in the Supplemental Information.

106

2.3. SIR epidemic simulation model. For simulations with just two age classes, we use a sto-

107

chastic SIR model implemented using the Gillespie algorithm [38]. For all simulations, the basic

108

reproduction number R0 is set at 1.5, consistent with estimates of the basic reproduction number

109

of 2009 A/H1N1 pandemic influenza [39, 40]. We consider a population size of N = 1, 000 split

110

evenly between classes 1 and 2, so that N1 = N2 = 500 (age groups with different population

111

sizes are also considered in the Supplemental Information). The expected time to recovery 1/γ is

112

assumed constant for all age groups and is set at 7 days, which is consistent with estimates of the

113

infectious period for 2009 pandemic influenza [40]. Table S1 gives the rates at which individuals of

114

each class stochastically progress from susceptible to infected to recovered. Infections are binned

115

into week-long intervals, and Poisson noise is added to simulate non-influenza influenza-like ill-

116

ness. Fig. S7 depicts five incidence time series produced using the model. Full details on the

117

model and simulation procedure are given in the Supplemental Information.

118

2.4. Poisson epidemic simulation model. For more than two age classes, the full stochastic

119

SIR model becomes too computationally demanding for repeated simulations to be practical. So,

120

we also define an outbreak simulation model based on a self-exciting Poisson process, similar to

121

[41]. We choose the time units t to match the mean generation interval of the infection, which we

122

set at 3.5 days [42]. To generate epidemics, we use a stepwise-constant effective reproduction

123

number Rt , such that Rt = 1.5 for the first four weeks (eight generations) of the outbreak and

124

Rt = 0.8 thereafter. Infections are binned from the half-week generations into week-long intervals,

125

and additional Poisson noise is added to each bin to simulate non-influenza influenza-like illness.

126

For simulations with two age classes, the Poisson model yields epidemics of similar length and

127

magnitude as the two-age-class SIR model (compare Figs S7 and S8), and yields comparable STE

128

inferences (see Fig. 1), which suggests that the Poisson model is an acceptable approximation to

129

the stochastic SIR model. Full details on the implementation of the Poisson model are given in the

130

Supplemental Information.

131

2.5. Reporting rates. Only a fraction of influenza cases are represented in the SDI-ILI dataset,

132

since many people do not seek medical care for their symptoms. The tendency to seek medical

133

care given infection with an ILI can vary by age group [43]. To factor this into the outbreak simula-

134

tions, we introduce a reporting rate vector c in which element ci gives the expected proportion of

135

individuals in age class i who seek medical care when infected with an ILI. It is then possible to

136

simulate a ‘reported’ disease incidence time series:

model) and Yi,t

3.1. STE reveals transmission asymmetries between two coupled age groups. We first cal-

141

culate the STE between two age groups as the within- and between-group reproduction ratios

142

vary. We consider between-group transmission that ranges from (a) fully decoupled to fully sym-

143

metric, and (b) fully symmetric to strongly driven by Group 1. The between-group infectiousness is

144

specified using a “relative reproduction matrix” r, which is a scaled version of the next-generation

145

matrix [28], such that ri,j /rk,j gives the proportional difference in group j’s infectiousness for

146

group i vs. group j. For example, if ri,j /rk,j = 2, then a member of group j is expected to infect

147

twice as many members of group i than of group k. Scenario (a) is encapsulated by the relative

148

reproduction matrix

Fig. 1 depicts the change in STE under these two transmission scenarios, calculated from

152

epidemics simulated using the stochastic SIR model (Fig. 1 A–B) and the Poisson model (Fig. 1

153

C–D). Each pane in Fig. 1 is produced using 100 ensembles of 800 simulated epidemics for each

154

value of za and zb between 0 and 1 in steps of size 0.1. For each ensemble, the 800 simulated

155

incidence time series are symbolised using symbols of length m = 3, and then the between-group

156

transfer entropies are estimated using the relative symbol frequencies (see Fig. S3), producing 100

157

STE estimates for each value of za and zb . The solid blue (black) lines in Fig. 1 depict the mean

158

Group 1→2 (Group 2→1) STE for each value of za and zb across the 100 ensembles. The shaded

159

blue (black) bands depict the range of the middle 95 Group 1→2 (Group 2→1) STE estimates for

160

each value of za and zb across the 100 ensembles, analogous to a 95% confidence interval. Under

161

both the stochastic SIR and the Poisson models, the between-group STE increases steadily as

162

the transmissive coupling ranges from none to symmetric (Fig. 1 A, C). Once Group 1 begins to

163

dominate transmission, the Group 1→2 STE increases and the Group 2→1 STE decreases (Fig.

164

1 B, D), accurately capturing the transmissive relationship between the age groups.

165

When Group 1 drives transmission, the Poisson model yields a smaller difference in the STE

166

between the two age groups than the stochastic SIR model does (Fig. 1 B, D). Visual inspection

167

suggests that the simulated time series produced using the stochastic SIR model tend to feature

168

more stochastic fluctuations than the time series produced using the Poisson model (Figs S7 and

169

S8). Since STE is effectively a measure of how these stochastic fluctuations transmit from one

170

age group to another, this may explain why the differences in STE calculated using the Poisson

171

model are relatively less pronounced. Overall, the qualitative similarity between the STE estimates

which could represent ‘children’ (Group 2) having strong within-group transmission (r2,2 = 4) and

182

intermediate transmission to ‘infants’ (Group 1) and ‘adults’ (Group 3) (r1,2 = r3,2 = 2). Even for

183

reporting rates as low as 0.1, the STE values from Group 2 are higher than those from any other

184

group. As the reporting rates increase, the differences become more pronounced, accurately

185

capturing the transmissive dominance of Group 2 over the other groups. The estimated STE

186

increases with reporting rate for all age groups, but more quickly for Group 2 than for the other

187

age groups. According to Biggerstaff et al. (2012) [43], true reporting rates for ILI in the US during

188

the 2009 pandemic were between 0.4 and 0.6, for which the transmissive dominance of Group 2

is clear.

3.3. STE reveals transmission asymmetries between twelve coupled age groups. To test the

191

ability of STE to identify transmission asymmetries from data on the scale of the SDI-ILI dataset,

we use the Poisson model to simulate 100 ensembles of 800 epidemics each with 12 age groups.

193

We consider the scenarios (a) with the 12 × 12 relative reproduction matrix Eq. S48, representing

194

high transmission from Groups 3–5 to Groups 3–5 (ri,j = 4 for i, j ∈ {3, 4, 5}), intermediate

195

transmission from groups 3–5 to groups 1–2 and 6–9 (ri,j = 2 for i ∈ {1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 9} and j ∈

196

{3, 4, 5}), baseline transmission (ri,j = 1) between all other groups, and uniform 50% reporting

197

rate across all groups, and (b) with uniform transmission strength across all age groups (i.e. a

198

12 × 12 relative reproduction matrix with ‘1’ for all entries), 60% reporting rate for groups 1–5, and

199

40% reporting rate for groups 6–12, following the estimates of Biggerstaff et al. (2012) [43] for the

4, and 5. The pairwise STE does not simply reproduce the structure of the relative reproduction

207

matrix, as evidenced by the variability in mean pairwise STE for age groups other than Groups

208

3–5. This is because the STE captures a ‘knock-on’ effect for which information transferred from

209

a strongly-driving age group can propagate through other age groups. For the uniform transmis-

210

sion/variable reporting rate scenario (scenario (b), Fig. 3B), it is evident that elevated reporting

211

rates can also lead to elevated STE, both to and from the groups with elevated reporting rate

212

(Groups 1–5). Overall, the variability in STE due to differences in reporting rate appears to be

213

smaller than the variability in STE due to differences in transmission strength. Further discussion

214

on the effect of reporting rates on STE may be found in the Supplemental Information.

F IGURE 3. Mean pairwise STE values between 12 groups for epidemics strongly
driven by Groups 3, 4, and 5 and uniform 50% reporting rate across all age groups
(A), and for epidemics driven equally by all age groups, 60% reporting for Groups
1–5, and 40% reporting for Groups 6–12 (B). A box in row i and column j corresponds to the STE from group j to group i, where darker shades corresponds to
higher STE. To generate the STE values, 100 ensembles of 800 epidemics were
simulated from the Poisson model using relative rate matrix Eq. S48 for (A) or a
relative rate matrix with all entries equal to 1 for (B). Each ensemble generates 144
pairwise STE values, so that each box represents the mean value across the 100
ensembles. The raw values are listed in Eqs S49 and S50.

3.4. School-aged children contributed disproportionately to transmission during the au-

216

tumn 2009 A/H1N1pdm influenza outbreak in the US. To estimate the pairwise STE between

217

the 12 age groups represented in the SDI-ILI dataset during the 2009 A/H1N1pdm influenza pan-

218

demic, we extract data from the 25 weeks between 12 July 2009 and 27 December 2009 and

219

symbolise the ILI time series for each age group in each ZIP using a symbol length of m = 3.

220

The pairwise STE values between all age groups are depicted in Fig. 4. The STE is highest in

221

the columns representing 5–19 year-olds. This provides evidence that there was systematically

222

elevated transmission from school-aged children to infants through adults. The adult-adult STE

223

is also moderately elevated, suggesting that adults may have played a relatively important role in

224

transmitting the outbreak amongst themselves, though this could also be explained by elevated

225

transmission from children alone. Compare, for example, to the left-hand plot in Fig 3: in that

226

simulation, only transmission from children is elevated, but it causes a moderate elevation in the

227

STE from adults and infants to the other age groups due to the knock-on effect.

228

As a control, we also calculated the pairwise STE between all age groups during 25 post-

229

pandemic weeks, from 10 January 2010 through 27 June 2010. For these months, there is no

230

apparent age structure in transmission (see Supplemental Information). We also calculated the

231

pairwise STE between age groups for six previous influenza seasons (see Supplemental Informa-

232

tion). For the 2009 pandemic, there is is a higher maximum pairwise STE and greater variation

233

in the pairwise STEs than for any previous season. This could reflect differences in baseline ILI,

234

which was likely lower during the autumn 2009 pandemic wave than during the seasonal out-

235

breaks, due to the pandemic’s earlier timing. A lower baseline ILI might have made pairwise dif-

236

ferences in STE easier to detect in 2009. However, the relatively higher and more heterogeneous

237

STE values in 2009 are also consistent with the hypothesis that school-aged children played a dis-

238

proportionately large role in the spread of the 2009 pandemic, as has been described elsewhere

239

[4].

240

It is unlikely that differences reporting rates alone can account for the elevated STE from 5–19

241

year-olds to the other age groups. The mean pairwise STE values computed from simulations

242

with uniform transmission rates and unequal reporting rates in Section 3.3 range from .0057 to

243

0.0084 (see Eq. S50), while the pairwise STE values computed from the SDI-ILI data range from

244

0.0056 to 0.084 (see Eq. S51), an order of magnitude larger. The mean pairwise STE values

245

computed from simulations with asymmetric transmission and uniform reporting rates Section 3.3

246

range from 0.0047 to 0.014 (see Eq. S49), closer to the range observed from the SDI-ILI data

247

but still somewhat smaller. This points towards a possible combined effect of strong transmissive

248

driving from children plus elevated reporting in children. In addition, re-calculating the pairwise

249

STE using probabilistic reconstructions of the pre-reporting SDI-ILI incidence time series (see

250

Supplemental Information) indicate that the observed transmissive dominance of 5–19 year-olds

251

persists even after adjusting for potential differences in reporting rate between children and adults.

252

Furthermore, Biggerstaff et al. (2012) [43] report that 0-4 year-olds had the highest reporting rates

253

for ILI in the United States in 2009, yet the STE from 0-4 year-olds is relatively low compared to

254

the other age groups. If reporting rates alone could explain the observed differences in STE, the

255

STE from infants should be at least as high as the STE from school-aged children.

256

It is also unlikely that the unequal partitions of the age groups can explain the observed pat-

257

terns in the pairwise STE. The age groups under 20 years are partitioned such that they span

258

fewer years, and thus contain fewer individuals, than the age groups above 20 years. Direct cal-

259

culations and simulations (see Supplemental Information) indicate that, all else being equal, the

260

out-going STE for a given group tends to increase as the group’s population size increases rel-

261

ative to the sizes of the other groups. If differences in the groups’ population sizes were driving

262

the observed pairwise STE values, we would expect the age groups over 20 years to appear to

263

dominate transmission – which is the opposite of what we observe here.

4. D ISCUSSION

265

Here, we propose STE as a means of ranking which age groups contribute most to the trans-

266

mission of infectious disease outbreaks. STE is chosen for its robustness to point-wise noise

267

and overall amplitude shifts in time series, which especially affect the ILI data stream due to non-

268

influenza respiratory illness and incomplete reporting. Simulation studies indicate that STE can

269

correctly rank transmissive asymmetries between age groups. However, STE is also positively as-

270

sociated with reporting rates, which can partially confound estimates of asymmetric transmission.

271

STE estimates from ILI time series data from July-December 2009 in the United States suggest

272

that 5–19 year-olds were primarily responsible for driving transmission of the autumn wave of

273

the A/H1N1pdm pandemic influenza outbreak. It is unlikely that this result can be explained by

274

differences in reporting rates alone.

275

The identification of school-aged children as the primary drivers of transmission of the 2009

276

influenza pandemic in the United States agrees with most other studies on age-specific transmis-

277

sion of both seasonal and pandemic influenza [4, 7, 8, 9]. Elevated transmission from school-aged

278

children is likely due in part to the relatively high number of daily interpersonal contacts made by

279

members of these age groups. Mossong et al. (2008) [8] for example estimate that 10–19 year-

280

olds have more contacts per day than any other age group, and conclude from a modelling study

281

based on empirical contact data that 5–19 year-olds are likely to both suffer the highest burden of

282

disease and to drive the early-stage transmission of an outbreak transmitted by droplets through

283

close contacts, like influenza. This underscores the importance of monitoring children during pan-

284

demic influenza outbreaks, and potentially prioritizing school-aged children for vaccination.

285

TE is closely linked to mutual information [31] and Granger causality [33]. Unlike TE, mutual in-

286

formation is symmetric; that is, it measures the probabilistic dependence between two processes,

287

but cannot determine the direction of information transfer between them, if there is any [31]. Mea-

288

suring the delayed mutual information between two processes is one way to introduce asymmetry.

289

This takes a step toward inferring whether one process influences another, by measuring shared

290

information between the present state of one process and the past states of another [31]. While

291

the lagged mutual information describes how one process’ history predicts the static probabilities

292

of another, the TE measures how one process’ history influences the transition probabilities of

293

another. Because of this, the TE is less likely to be confounded by a shared input signal, and

294

is a better measure of stochastic ‘driving’ [31]. Section 2 of Kaiser and Schreiber (2002) [44]

295

provides a detailed description of the differences between TE and mutual information. Granger

296

causality, on the other hand, is a special case of TE that arises when the stochastic processes are

297

jointly Gaussian-distributed [45]. The TE is thus better suited than Granger causality for making

298

inferences on more general, possibly nonlinear, processes, though this comes at the expense of

299

requiring more data and having no clear way to test statistical significance [45].

300

Convergent cross mapping (CCM) [34] was developed to solve a similar problem as TE, but is

301

based on somewhat different underlying theory. CCM was developed to detect so-called ‘causal’

302

relationships in partially stochastic systems with underlying deterministic structure. CCM relies

303

on Takens’ theorem [46] to reconstruct candidate manifolds of the underlying dynamical system

304

using lagged observations from two time series. ‘Causality’ is inferred if nearby points on one

305

reconstructed manifold consistently map to nearby points on the other reconstructed manifold.

306

CCM has been used to provide evidence that temperature and absolute humidity fluctuations

307

drive the timing of global seasonal influenza outbreaks [47], though some controversy surrounds

308

these findings [48, 49]. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see whether CCM can reveal

309

asymmetric epidemiological interactions between age groups, and to compare its findings with

310

those identified using TE. Lungarella et al. (2007) [50] provide more detail on the relationships

311

between various methods that infer asymmetric relationships from time series data. (As an aside,

312

we prefer to avoid the term ‘causality’ with respect to these methods, despite its frequent use in

313

the literature. Regardless of the vocabulary used, they have successfully detected meaningful

314

relationships between real-world coupled dynamic processes [30, 32, 34, 51, 52, 53]).

315

Despite the apparent well-suitedness of STE for making inferences from ILI data, its epidemio-

316

logical relevance currently remains limited. The calculation of STE requires no prior epidemiolog-

317

ical information whatsoever, which makes its success somewhat surprising. The next-generation

318

matrix [28] is the key object for characterising age-structured, or more generally population-structured,

319

disease transmission dynamics, and yet there is no obvious direct link between STE estimates

320

and the NGM. It is possible that further simulation studies could help identify such a link; even

321

though the STE values seem to bear little mechanistic meaning apart from the relative ordering

322

of age groups that they yield, it is possible that regressing the inferred STE values on an under-

323

lying known NGM could connect the pairwise STE matrix with the NGM under certain conditions.

324

However, it appears unlikely that a simple link exists, especially since STE can say nothing about

325

transmission within a single age group, which is necessary for filling in the diagonal entries of

326

the NGM. STE and related methods such as CCM that do not explicitly incorporate mechanis-

327

tic descriptions of the underlying physical system are unlikely to be able to reveal more than an

328

approximate hierarchy of driving processes. Nevertheless, such a hierarchy can contain valu-

329

able information, especially if developing and fitting a mechanistic model is too demanding to be

330

practicable. Certain extensions to STE could also enhance its relevance for epidemiological in-

331

ference. Local transfer entropy [54] and state-dependent transfer entropy [55], like the contextual

332

STE (see Supplemental Information), are intended to make the TE more flexible and general, by

333

considering how information transfer may change under varying conditions or ‘meta-states’. These

334

extensions may yield better insight into epidemic processes, which are inherently nonlinear and

335

context-dependent, than the more traditional measurements of transfer entropy can provide.

336

Perhaps the most important challenge confronting the TE and related measurements is decid-

337

ing how to measure statistical power and significance. STE calculations rely on a middle level

338

of stochasticity in the underlying stochastic processes; for a deterministic system, the STE will

339

always be exactly zero, while for a stochastic system with too much within-sequence noise, the

340

small-scale variation in amplitudes will likely mask important patterns from which the transfer of

341

information might be inferred. The acceptable range of stochasticity has not been clearly defined.

342

Similarly, it is unclear how best to measure when a difference in STE should be called statistically

343

significant. Though this is recognised as an open and difficult problem [45, 48], it may be possible

344

to make some progress by assuming that the underlying process follows certain epidemiological,

345

or otherwise well-specified, dynamics.
