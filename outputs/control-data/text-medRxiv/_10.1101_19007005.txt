Abstract
Objective There is evidence that e-cigarette use is less harmful than smoking, but
there are also concerns that e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to smoking among
young people. The aim of this review was to investigate whether e-cigarette use
compared to non-use in young non-smokers is associated with subsequent cigarette
smoking.
Design Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Data sources PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Wiley Cochrane Library databases,
and the 2018 Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco and Society for
Behavioural Medicine conference abstracts.
Eligibility criteria for selecting studies All studies of young people (up to age 30 years)
with a measure of e-cigarette use prior to smoking and an outcome measure of
smoking where an odds ratio could be calculated were included (excluding reviews
and animal studies).
Results Of 9,199 results, 17 studies were included in the meta-analysis. There was
strong evidence for an association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and
later smoking (OR 4.59, 95% CI 3.60 to 5.85) when the results were meta-analysed in a
random effects model. However, there was high heterogeneity (I2 = 88%).
Conclusions Whilst the association between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and
subsequent smoking appears strong, the available evidence is limited by the reliance
on self-report measures of smoking history without biochemical verification. None of
the studies included negative controls which would provide stronger evidence for
whether the association may be causal. Much of the evidence also failed to consider

the nicotine content of e-liquids used by non-smokers meaning it is difficult to make
conclusions about whether nicotine is the mechanism driving this association.

Introduction
Existing evidence suggests that e-cigarette use is considerably less harmful
than smoking 1 and is an effective smoking cessation aid 2; however, there are
concerns that e-cigarettes may act as a gateway to smoking cigarettes among young
people. If this is correct, rather than seeing a decline in smoking rates we may see
smoking rates remaining stable or increasing due to a new generation of smokers for
whom e-cigarettes have acted as a route into smoking. This hypothesis (sometimes
referred to as the ‘gateway hypothesis’) has been widely debated among researchers
and public health officials. Some argue that a common liability better explains the
association between vaping and later smoking, whereby the same factors that increase
the likelihood of someone vaping also increase the likelihood of someone smoking.3 As
many people use e-cigarettes to help them stop smoking, it would also be logical to
assume the opposite direction of causality with smoking causing people to vape.4 The
lack of consensus on the issue demonstrates the need for the current evidence to be
synthesised.
One systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between baseline
e-cigarette use and later smoking concluded that e-cigarette use was associated with
an increased likelihood of smoking at follow up.5 Although this meta-analysis is
relatively recent, this is a fast-moving field with a substantial number of relevant
studies having been published since 2017. Given the topic is of great interest to
researchers and policy makers, an updated meta-analysis is necessary. Moreover, in
the previous meta-analysis,5 moderate heterogeneity was observed between the study
results. Some potential sources of heterogeneity could include the age range of the
participants in the studies and risk of bias among the studies. Soneji and colleagues 5

addressed this by stratifying by average age, finding that there was greater
heterogeneity between studies of adolescents (under 18 years) compared to studies of
young adults. However, they did not stratify by risk of bias. This is important because
the preconceptions of study authors may also influence how studies are designed and
conducted, and this may be reflected in a study’s conclusions. For example, two
studies in the Soneji and colleagues 5 meta-analysis drew diverging conclusions,
despite the pooled odd ratios not differing substantially from each other. Leventhal
and colleagues 6 concluded there was insufficient evidence to support the gateway
hypothesis, whereas Miech and colleagues 7 concluded that there was a one-way
bridge from e-cigarette use to smoking, despite both studies having similar results.
In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we updated and extended
previous reviews in which e-cigarette use and later smoking have been explored while
looking at a broad range of evidence. Our aim was to investigate whether e-cigarette
use, compared to non-use, in young non-smokers is associated with subsequent
cigarette use by combining evidence from studies investigating e-cigarette use and
subsequent smoking where an odds ratio could be calculated. Additionally, we aimed
to use stratification to explore sources of heterogeneity and biases in conclusions
regarding the gateway hypothesis. From our knowledge of the evidence base and
considering this is a fast-moving area of research, we expected to identify a substantial
number of studies that have been published since the review by Soneji and
colleagues.5

The protocol for this systematic review and meta-analysis was published online
prior to initiating the search and can be found on the Open Science Framework
(https://osf.io/3gc2y/). PRISMA and MOOSE guidelines were followed (where
applicable).

Eligibility Criteria

We included randomised controlled trials, longitudinal studies, cross-sectional
studies, and case-control studies. Only studies investigating young people aged up to
the age of 30 years old (inclusive) were included. Studies had to have a baseline or
retrospective measure of e-cigarette use (including but not limited to ever, occasional,
heavy, recent, regular or frequent use) prior to initiating smoking and a measure of
cigarette smoking (including but not limited to ever, occasional, heavy, recent, regular,
frequent or escalated smoking) as an outcome. Studies had to include a comparison
group (i.e., group which the exposed group is compared to), which could include
young people who were never, trial or not recent e-cigarette users or smokers,
dependent on the study. Review articles and animal studies were excluded.

Information Sources

Our search strategy was a replication and extension of a strategy used in a
similar review.5 We conducted an electronic search of the databases PubMed, Embase,
Web of Science, Wiley Cochrane Library, Society for Research on Nicotine and
Tobacco, and the Society for Behavioural Medicine. Due to member restricted access

we were unable to search the NIH Tobacco Regulatory Science Conference abstracts as
stated in our pre-registered protocol. We compared the list of studies to be included
to those included in previous similar reviews to ensure the search strategy had not
omitted any relevant studies. Studies written in languages other than English were
translated by colleagues and using Google translate where translations were not
already available. The search strategy was conducted up to 24th November 2018. Ecigarettes are a relatively new product on the consumer market; therefore, no date
restrictions were placed on the search strategy.

Search Strategy

Studies were initially selected for screening using the following search terms
within the titles, abstracts or keywords: Cigar* OR Tobacco OR Smok* AND Electronic
Cigarette* OR E-Cig* OR Electronic Nicotine Delivery System* OR Vape OR Vaping OR
Alternative Nicotine Delivery System*. Boolean operators and truncations differed
depending on the database. Relevant MeSH terms were included when searching the
PubMed database. An example search can be found in the Supplementary Material.

Study Selection and Data Collection Process

Study selection and data extraction took place over three stages. Stage 1
consisted of title and abstract screening; Stage 2 consisted of a full text screening;
Stage 3 consisted of data extraction from selected studies. A full list of extracted data
is included in the supplementary material. Titles, abstracts and full text articles were

double screened and then double extracted by three reviewers (JK, [100%], SS [50%],
and SP [50%]). Discrepancies were resolved by a third reviewer where necessary.
Covidence (www.covidence.org), an online systematic review tool which is in
partnership with Cochrane, was used to streamline and document this process.
When insufficient information was available to determine eligibility, we
contacted study authors. Where insufficient information was provided or obtained,
the text was excluded from the review.

Risk of Bias Assessment

Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). The
selection, comparability and outcome domains of the tool were used to assess the risk
of bias in all full texts included in the review. The studies were rated as good, fair or
poor quality based on the star system of the tool (maximum of 9 stars, see
supplementary material for more information). Quality/risk was double assessed by
the review team. Studies were not excluded based on risk of bias.
Risk of bias across studies was assessed using the symmetry and 95%
confidence region of a funnel plot.8 Asymmetry and more than 5% of points lying
above the 95% confidence region may indicate some bias across studies.

Causality Assessment

Using Bradford-Hill criteria, we selected four criteria which were relevant to
the studies of interest to indicate the strength of evidence of a possible causal

relationship between our exposure and outcome (see Supplementary material for
more details). These were: strength of association, specificity, temporality and dose
responsivity. These criteria are particularly relevant to studies assessing whether ecigarettes may act as a gateway to smoking.3

Summary Measures

Effect estimates were reported as odds ratios (and converted where
necessary). Odds ratios of the association between e-cigarette use and later cigarette
use were combined using a random effects model. All unadjusted odds ratios were
calculated using observed data points which were obtained from the original study or
directly from the author if insufficient information was provided in the original study.
Calculated effect sizes were double checked by the review team.
Adjusted odds ratios were reported as they were in the original study and
adjusted risk ratios were converted to odds ratios using a modified version of a
formula published in the Cochrane Handbook (Section 12.5.4.4)8: OR = (-RR + RR × ACR)
/ (RR × ACR - 1), where OR = odds ratio; RR = risk ratio; ACR = assumed control risk

(calculated on a per study basis as the risk of later smoking among controls).

Synthesis and Results

In a random-effects model, we calculated the pooled odds ratios from
unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios for ever cigarette use at follow up among never
smokers at baseline, in ever compared to never e-cigarette users at baseline. Where

multiple exposure or outcome measures were included in the original study, this
estimate was used in the main analysis. If ever use of e-cigarettes was not reported,
the main effect reported in the study was included in our main analyses.
We also analysed the results in a series of subgroups – we pooled odds for: i)
ever versus never e-cigarette use at baseline and ever versus never smoking at follow
up, ii) ever versus never e-cigarette use at baseline and current (past 30 day) versus
non-current use of cigarettes at follow up, and iii) current vs non-current e-cigarette
use at baseline and ever vs never smoking at follow up. In retrospective studies,
measures of e-cigarette use prior to smoking were treated as baseline and smoking
status at the time of the study was treated as the follow up. We aimed to pool the
results of regular (at least monthly for more than 6 months) cigarette use at follow up
among never smokers at baseline, in regular compared to non-regular e-cigarette
users at baseline; however, insufficient data were available to do so.
Heterogeneity of study effect estimates can be indicated by an I2 statistic.
Sources of heterogeneity were explored through subgroup analysis. All analyses were
conducted using Stata SE version 15.1 and Review Manager version 5.

Results
Study Selection

Figure 1 shows the PRISMA study selection flow chart. A total of 15,519 studies
were selected for title and abstract screening, 9,199 remained after exclusion of
duplicates. After title and abstract screening, 133 studies were selected for full text
screening. Of these, 24 studies were initially selected for inclusion; however, 7 studies
were not included in the meta-analysis because the data overlapped with other
included studies. Where data overlapped, the most relevant study was selected based
on aims (i.e., studies where the primary aim addressed the question of interest were
selected above those which addressed the question in secondary analysis) and sample
size (i.e., larger sample sizes were included where both studies were relevant). In the
meta-analysis, 16 studies were included in the main pooled unadjusted analysis and 17
studies were included in the pooled adjusted analysis. One study was excluded from
the unadjusted analysis due to insufficient raw data availability but had adjusted
results available.

Study Characteristics

Details of the study characteristics are shown in Table S1. The majority of the
studies included were longitudinal and one was cross-sectional in which participants
were asked questions regarding their product use retrospectively. Total study sizes
varied considerably, ranging from 347 to 39,718 and the number of participants
included in the final analyses were often substantially smaller. Participants were

mostly under 18 and many of the studies were school-based. Where the number of
males and females in the study were reported, around 50% of participants were male
in most cases. However, only 33% were male in one study.9 The majority of the studies
(ten) were conducted in the US, three studies took place in the UK, one was based in
Canada, one in Mexico, one in Germany and one in the Netherlands. Follow up periods
ranged from 4-24 months.
In terms of observed exposures, most studies explored ever e-cigarette use
with never e-cigarette users as a comparator. Two studies looked at current users with
not current users as the comparator 7 10 and two looked at both current and ever
use.11 12 Only one study considered the amount of exposure to nicotine,13 and one
study looked at frequency of e-cigarette use.14 In the one study that took nicotine use
into account,13 two separate analyses were conducted for: 1) ever use of nicotine
containing e-cigarettes (OR = 11.90, 95% CI 3.36 to 42.11); and 2) ever use of nonnicotine containing e-cigarettes (OR= 5.36, 95% CI 2.73 to 10.52). However, the
analysis groups were not mutually exclusive (i.e., an individual would have been in
both analysis groups if they had tried both nicotine containing and nicotine free ecigarettes). No analysis was reported using subgroups of exclusive nicotine or nicotinefree use. The one study which addressed frequency of e-cigarette use 14 found that
those who had used e-cigarettes at varying frequencies from once or twice (OR = 2.88,
95% CI 1.96 to 4.22) to weekly/daily (OR = 4.09, 95% CI 2.43 to 6.88) were more likely
than those who had not used e-cigarettes to have smoked at least once at follow up.
Most of the included studies used ever smoking as an outcome. One study
explored experimentation with smoking, as well as frequent and infrequent smoking,15
and three looked at recent/current smoking at follow up.6 11 12

Covariates included in the analyses varied greatly between studies. One study
only adjusted for four covariates 16 while another adjusted for over 20 covariates.17 All
studies adjusted for sex and most adjusted for age and race/ethnicity. Other
frequently included covariates were peer smoking, sensation seeking (and related
factors), and drug and alcohol use. No studies adjusted for nicotine exposure via ecigarettes (i.e., e-liquid content and/or frequency of nicotine exposure).

Quality/Risk of Bias Within Studies and Causality

The quality of studies (or inversely, risk of bias) was good in most cases when
rated using the NOS (Table S2). One study was rated as fair quality,6 and three were
rated as poor quality.13 18 19 Of the four Bradford-Hill criteria for causality deemed
relevant to this research, the majority (11 studies) met three criteria (usually strength
of evidence, temporality and specificity), four studies only met two criteria 6 9 10 18 and
two met four criteria.13 14

Results of Individual Studies

The results of individual studies included in the main meta-analysis can be
found in Table 1 and within forest plots in figures 2 (unadjusted) and 3 (adjusted).
Effect sizes (odds ratios [OR]) ranged from 2.39 to 12.31 (unadjusted). All estimates
were considered to show strong evidence of a positive association between ecigarette use among non-smokers and later smoking in unadjusted analyses.
Covariates included in the adjusted analyses varied on a study-by-study basis. After

adjustment, effects in all but two studies 6 9 remained strong. The inclusion of
covariates in the model attenuated most results (although none were attenuated to
the null). Effect sizes were strengthened after adjustment in four studies.13 15 19 20

Synthesis of Results

When pooled in a random effects meta-analysis, e-cigarette use in nonsmoking young people was associated with a 4-and-a-half-fold increase in the odds of
subsequent smoking (unadjusted; OR = 4.59, 95% CI 3.60 to 5.85). Pooling the adjusted
estimates, the association was still strong but somewhat weaker (adjusted; OR = 2.92,
95% CI 2.30 to 3.71). Heterogeneity statistics indicated there was high heterogeneity
in both the unadjusted (I² = 88%) and adjusted (I² = 85%) analyses.
Forest plots of the analyses sub-grouped by varying exposure and outcome
levels can be found in the supplementary material (Figures S1-S4). Of the 16 studies
included in the unadjusted meta-analyses, 13 provided results which explored ever ecigarette use and ever smoking and three studies provided results for ever e-cigarette
use and current smoking. Three studies explored past 30-day e-cigarette use and ever
smoking. Further studies explored: past 30-day use of e-cigarettes and past 30-day
smoking (1 study), frequency of e-cigarette use (1 study) and frequency of smoking (1
study). Pooled analyses were not possible for these subgroups.
Ever e-cigarette use and ever smoking subgrouping. Pooled analyses of studies
exploring ever vaping among never smokers and subsequent ever smoking resulted in
a pooled unadjusted odds ratio of 4.17 (95% CI 3.53 to 6.29). Heterogeneity between
included studies in this analysis was high (I² = 90%). The results of the pooled adjusted

analysis were similar with slightly lower odds (OR = 3.13, 95% CI 2.35 to 4.16).
Heterogeneity between included studies was still high in the adjusted analysis (I² =
84%).
Ever e-cigarette use and current smoking subgrouping. Among never smokers,
pooled unadjusted analyses indicated ever e-cigarette users had increased odds of
subsequently becoming a current smoker (OR = 4.35, 95% CI 2.95 to 6.42) compared to
never e-cigarette users. Heterogeneity estimates indicated low heterogeneity (I² =
41%). Adjusted analyses showed similar but weakened results when pooled (OR =
2.12, 95% CI 1.72 to 2.84). Heterogeneity was indicated as low in the adjusted pooled
analyses (I² = 5%).
Current e-cigarette use and ever smoking subgrouping. Past 30-day use of ecigarettes among never smokers was associated with increased odds of ever
subsequently smoking (OR = 5.64, 95% CI 3.75 to 8.50) in pooled unadjusted analysis.
Heterogeneity estimates indicated low heterogeneity (I² = 49%). The pooled adjusted
analysis also indicated increased odds of ever subsequently smoking (OR = 2.33, 95%
CI 1.84 to 2.96). Heterogeneity estimates also indicated low heterogeneity when the
adjusted results were pooled (I² = 5%).
Stratification by age. When the unadjusted main analyses were stratified by
age (including vs. excluding under 18 year olds) the pooled odds ratio among studies
including those under 18 years was slightly higher (OR = 4.87, 95% CI 3.73 to 6.35)
than the pooled odds ratio of studies excluding those under 18 (OR = 3.17, 95% CI 2.37
to 4.25). Heterogeneity estimates indicated that there was low heterogeneity between
studies excluding under 18’s (I² = 32%) but high heterogeneity between studies

including under 18’s (I² = 88%). Adjusted pooled analyses are reported in
Supplementary Figures S5-S6.
Stratification by study quality/risk of bias. Due to limited variation in quality
rating of studies using the NOS, fair and poor quality studies were pooled and
compared to good quality studies. The pooled unadjusted odds ratio for studies rated
as good quality (n = 13 studies; OR = 4.29, 95% CI 3.67 to 5.01) was lower than the
pooled odds ratios for fair/poor quality studies (n = 3 studies; OR = 5.41, 95% CI 1.67
to 17.51). Heterogeneity measures indicated that high quality studies were less
heterogeneous than fair/poor quality studies (I² = 60% and I² = 97% respectively).
Adjusted pooled analyses are shown in Supplementary Figures S7-S8.
Stratification by support for the gateway hypothesis. During the review
process it became apparent that many studies did not draw clear conclusions
regarding the gateway hypothesis or made balanced conclusions. This made it difficult
to categorise studies and as such we were unable to stratify based on this criterion.
Stratification by location of study. There were only two countries in which
more than one included study was conducted; 10 studies took place in the US and
three took place in the UK. The pooled estimate for unadjusted odds of studies
conducted in the US was 3.95 (95% CI 3.17 to 4.92) and in the UK was 5.55 (95% CI
3.94 to 7.82). Heterogeneity for studies conducted was high in the US (I² = 93%) and
moderate in the UK (I² = 52%). The other studies were located in the Netherlands,
Germany, Canada and Mexico. Pooling these results, the odds of subsequent smoking
was 4.75 (95% CI 2.54 to 8.89) with high heterogeneity between studies (I² = 96%).
Adjusted pooled analyses are shown in Supplementary Figures S9-S11.

Risk of Bias Across Studies

The risk of bias across studies is shown in a funnel plot in Figure 4. The figure is
somewhat asymmetrical and some points (25%) lie above the superimposed funnel
limits (95% confidence region) suggesting that there may be some publication bias and
indicating there may be heterogeneity (as supported by the I2 statistics) or selection
bias across the included studies.21

Discussion
Our results indicated that self-reported non-smokers who have used ecigarettes have 4-and-a-half-fold higher odds of subsequently reporting being smokers
than those who have not. The pooled adjusted estimate indicated a weaker, although
still strong, association with nearly 3-fold increased odds of later smoking. Subgrouping and stratification revealed some differences between groups, but all findings
indicated a strong positive association. The main findings were consistent with the
findings of Soneji and colleagues,5 whereby there was a strong positive association
between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and subsequent smoking and a high
degree of heterogeneity between studies. Similar to Soneji and colleagues,5
stratification by age revealed slightly lower pooled estimates for the odds of smoking
in studies which excluded under 18-year olds compared to studies including them.
Stratification by location indicated stronger associations in the UK compared to the US
and other countries.
This association between e-cigarette use and later smoking could be explained
as a gateway effect,3 22 which could be caused by a perceived advantage of smoking

over e-cigarette use. For example, users may perceive a social advantage if they
receive peer pressure to smoke or think that cigarettes provide a richer taste
compared to e-cigarette vapour.3 However, more often in the literature, the claim is
that the gateway effect is attributable to nicotine addiction.22 E-cigarettes have
historically not delivered nicotine as effectively as cigarettes,23 so that e-cigarettes
may not be adequate to satisfy users who become more heavily addicted to nicotine.
The original gateway hypothesis referred to the use of ‘soft’ drugs (e.g. cannabis)
leading to the use of ‘hard’ drugs (e.g. heroin), with three main principles; i) the ‘soft’
drug exposure occurs prior to the use of the ‘hard’ drug, ii) there is an increased risk of
subsequent ‘hard’ drug use among ‘soft’ drug users compared to non-users, and iii)
there is a dose-response relationship.24 The results of this meta-analysis appear to
satisfy the second principle of the gateway hypothesis (increased risk) if we consider ecigarette use to be the ‘soft’ drug and cigarettes to be the ‘hard’ drug.
The first principle of the gateway hypothesis (temporality) also appears to be
satisfied in this meta-analysis as almost all of the studies were longitudinal. All studies
except one measured exposure prior to smoking and smoking at follow up; therefore,
the association between earlier e-cigarette use and later smoking is unlikely to be due
to reverse causality (i.e. smoking leading to e-cigarette use). However, smoking status
is often misreported by young people, 25 meaning that some self-reported nonsmokers at baseline may in fact have smoked previously. If ever smokers misreport
their smoking history at baseline, but they accurately report that they are ever
smokers at follow up, the association could be biased away from the null. Self-reports
were validated in one study 26 using breath carbon monoxide levels, however, with the
short half-life of breath carbon monoxide (4-6 hours) this measure is not suitable to

validate self-reports of ever smoking. In future research, the use of biomarkers which
can identify long term exposure could help researchers to objectively confirm selfreported smoking status at baseline. Consequently, researchers could more
confidently dismiss reverse causation as an explanation for the association and satisfy
the second principle of the gateway theory (providing there is a true association).
The third principle of the theory assumes that increased nicotine exposure via
e-cigarettes will lead to greater risk of later smoking. Despite there being few plausible
explanations for why e-cigarettes would act as a gateway to smoking that do not
involve nicotine,3 only one of the included studies measured and took into account the
nicotine content of the e-cigarettes used. This study indicated that both use of
nicotine containing e-cigarettes and (to a lesser extent) non-nicotine containing ecigarettes are strongly associated with later smoking.13 This suggests that nicotine
exposure may be one factor in the association between e-cigarette use and later
smoking, but not the sole mechanism. An association among users of zero-nicotine
liquid e-cigarettes could be better explained by there being a common liability for
smoking and e-cigarette use. Unfortunately, the study reported analyses based on
nicotine vs non-nicotine vaping in which these two groups were not mutually exclusive
(i.e., individuals would be in both analysis groups if they tried both nicotine containing
and nicotine free e-cigarettes). Thus, it is unclear whether there is an association
between e-cigarette use among non-smokers and later smoking when users have not
been exposed to nicotine. To determine whether there is a nicotine dose-response
involved in the association, we would also need to observe the frequency of ecigarette use prior to smoking. The one study that looked at frequency of use indicated
that there may be a dose-response to nicotine when comparing use just once/twice to

use weekly/daily.14 However, the odds of later smoking did not increase linearly with
each increased level of frequency of use. Without further study of nicotine and any
dose-response relationship between nicotine exposure and subsequent smoking,
there is insufficient evidence to strongly support the third principle of the gateway
hypothesis and we cannot confidently infer causality according to Bradford-Hill
criteria.
Although the three other Bradford-Hill criteria were commonly rated as having
been met in the included studies, it is worth noting that our measure of specificity was
relatively liberal. We rated studies as specific if they adjusted for more than basic
demographic factors. Had we determined studies to only have met this criterion if they
had explored negative controls, none would have met the criterion. Using negative
controls could reveal whether other factors (e.g. having an impulsive personality) may
be having an underlying effect on the association. Using an e-cigarette is unlikely to
cause other risky behaviours such as the number of sexual partners a person has; if
similar associations are seen between the two outcomes, it would indicate that the
link between e-cigarettes and smoking is due to a common liability rather than a
gateway via nicotine addiction.
Most studies included limited adjustment for potential confounders, which
means that residual confounding may affect the results of individual studies and our
meta-analysis. In particular, some potential confounders, like impulsivity, are difficult
to fully capture via self-report and are often assessed relatively crudely. Since
statistical adjustment can never fully remove the risk of confounding, other
approaches to exploring the potential for a common liability (e.g., to risk taking)
explaining the observed association between e-cigarette use and smoking is

warranted. For example, exploring the genetic aetiology of e-cigarette use may help in
understanding whether e-cigarette use and smoking share a common liability. The use
of negative control outcomes may also be informative. If e-cigarette use has a shared
genetic aetiology with other biologically unrelated risk behaviours, such as gambling,
this would also suggest that the association is not due to e-cigarette use acting as a
gateway, but due to the two behaviours sharing a common liability. The triangulation
of evidence obtained using different methods will be critical here.27
Future research should also consider the heterogeneity estimates observed in
this study. Age contributed to the observed heterogeneity in our meta-analysis – the
association was stronger in studies including under 18 year olds than studies excluding
them. In adolescence, risk-taking is common 28 and decision making for health-risk
behaviours is influenced by peers, societal influences and parental monitoring, but
these factors are less influential to adults.29 Such factors are likely to be confounders
of the association between e-cigarette use and later smoking, particularly in studies of
under 18 year olds and should be included as covariates where possible. The results
stratified by location also suggested there may be societal influences on the
association; the association was stronger among studies based in the UK than those
based in the US. This suggests that country-specific societal factors such as, legislation,
taxation, social norms, and public opinion may be confounding this association such
that study results may not be generalisable to other countries.
In conclusion, there is a strong association between e-cigarette use among
non-smokers and later smoking, but there is limited evidence to suggest that ecigarette use is acting as a gateway to smoking. The pooled estimates should be
interpreted with caution due to high heterogeneity among the included studies and

due to the limitations in the included studies’ methodology. Future research should
consider including relevant potential confounders, such as better measures of
impulsivity and other measures of propensity to risk taking, and objective measures of
smoking status in order to better explore the potential role of e-cigarettes as a
gateway to smoking. Studies that explore the genetic underpinnings of these
behaviours and use negative control outcomes may also help improve our
understanding of the association between e-cigarette use and later smoking.
