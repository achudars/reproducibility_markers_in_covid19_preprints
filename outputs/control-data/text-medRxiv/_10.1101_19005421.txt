Abstract
Purpose
The relationship between body-mass index (BMI) and prostate cancer remains unclear. However,
there is an inverse association between BMI and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), used for prostate
cancer screening. We conducted this review to estimate the associations between BMI and (1)
prostate cancer, (2) advanced prostate cancer, and (3) PSA.

Methods
We

searched

PubMed

and

Embase

for

studies

until

02

October

2017

and

obtained

individual

participant data from four studies. In total, 78 studies were identified for the association between
BMI and prostate cancer, 21 for BMI and advanced prostate cancer, and 35 for BMI and PSA. We
performed random-effects meta-analysis of linear associations of log PSA and prostate cancer with
BMI and, to examine potential non-linearity, of associations between categories of BMI and each
outcome.

Results
In

the

meta-analyses

with

continuous

BMI,

a

5

kg/m

increase

in

BMI

was

associated

with

a

percentage change in PSA of -5.88% (95% CI -6.87% to -4.87%). Using BMI categories, compared to
normal weight men the PSA levels of overweight men were 3.43% lower (95% CI -5.57% to -1.23%),
and obese men were 12.9% lower (95% CI -15.2% to -10.7%). Prostate cancer and advanced prostate
cancer analyses showed little or no evidence associations.

Conclusion
There is little or no evidence of an association between BMI and risk of prostate cancer or advanced
prostate cancer, and strong evidence of an inverse and non-linear association between BMI and PSA.

1. Background
Prostate cancer is the

second commonest male cancer worldwide, (1) and the most commonly

diagnosed cancer in men in the UK, with an estimated 47,151 diagnoses in 2015 (2). Generally, most
prostate cancers are slow growing, but can metastasise to the bones, lungs and brain. Worldwide,
there were an estimated 307,000 deaths from prostate cancer in 2012 (1), and in the UK, around
11,600 men died from prostate cancer in 2016 (2).

Body mass index (BMI) has been associated with many cancers (3), but its association with prostate
cancer is unclear. Previous meta-analyses and reviews have suggested that BMI is not associated
with prostate cancer (4,5), positively associated with prostate cancer (6,7) inversely associated with
localized prostate cancer (8), and positively associated with advanced (8), aggressive (9), high-grade
and fatal prostate cancers (4). These meta-analyses were either limited to cohort studies (5,7,8,10)
or

in

need

of

updating

(6,7).

Additionally,

no

meta-analysis

assessed

potential

non-linear

associations between BMI and risk of prostate cancer or advanced prostate cancer. We therefore
sought to perform an updated review of the literature, including more studies, and additionally
examining non-linear associations.

BMI

has

also

been

inversely

associated

with

prostate-specific

antigen

(PSA)

(11),

although

no

previous meta-analysis of this relationship exists. The presence of such an association could bias
observed relationships between BMI and prostate cancer as PSA testing often plays a key role in
diagnosis. More specifically, a negative association between BMI and PSA could lead to a spurious
negative association or mask a positive association between BMI and localised prostate cancer, as
obese men, with lower PSA values, would be less likely to be offered a biopsy as the result of a PSA
test. A negative association between BMI and PSA could also induce a spurious positive association
between BMI and advanced prostate cancer, as obese men may be diagnosed later, due to their
lower PSA levels. In addition, if the association between BMI and prostate cancer (or advanced
prostate

cancer) is non-linear,

then

studies with different distributions of BMI will

give

rise

to

different estimates of the BMI-prostate cancer association.

We systematically reviewed the literature for all relevant studies and performed meta-analyses. We

from

In analysing the IPD studies, we aimed to account for incomplete and PSA-dependent

diagnosis by imputing prostate cancer status for all men who did not receive a biopsy, and in doing,
avoid potential bias resulting from an association between BMI and PSA.

Our objectives were to: i) precisely quantify the (assumed linear) associations between BMI and
prostate cancer, advanced prostate cancer and PSA; ii) update previous meta-analyses using all
relevant evidence, including case-control studies; and iii) explore potential non-linearity in these
associations. Our overall aim was to understand whether BMI is a risk factor for prostate cancer, and
to identify whether failure to account for the role of PSA in many prostate cancer diagnoses is likely
to lead to biased estimates of the association between BMI and prostate cancer.

2. Methods
2.1 Eligibility criteria
We performed a systematic review in which we included original articles published in peer reviewed
journals that measured an association between BMI and total prostate cancer incidence and/or
advanced

prostate

cancer;

and

studies

that

measured

including supplements and meeting abstracts;

human

an

association

between

randomised controlled

BMI

and

PSA,

trials (RCTs), case-

control, cohort, cross-sectional, and non-randomised experimental studies. If the abstract did not
specifically mention BMI but mentioned height or weight, we acquired the full text to determine if
BMI was calculable from data included in the publication.

We

excluded

reviews,

books,

commentaries,

letters,

and

animal

and

cell-line

studies;

studies

examining pre-malignant disease if there was no mention of prostate cancer or PSA; studies where
BMI was measured after diagnosis of prostate cancer, as this increases the likelihood of reverse
causality; and studies that we considered to be at critical risk of bias (see

Section 2.4).

We determined the effect estimate to be for advanced prostate cancer if the individual studies
labelled the effect as “advanced” or “aggressive”, or if the effect was for locally advanced, extraprostatic, nodular or metastatic prostate cancer. High-grade prostate cancer on its own was not
considered equivalent to advanced prostate cancer and was not extracted.

2.2 Data Sources
We

searched

Medline

and

Embase

databases

up

to

02

October

2017

for

studies

in

humans

associating BMI with either prostate cancer or PSA. The search query was as follows (each term as a
text word search):

(BMI or body-mass index or obese or obesity or body weight or body size or

adiposity) AND (prostate cancer or prostate neoplasm or PSA or prostate-specific antigen) NOT
psoriatic arthritis.

Psoriatic arthritis was excluded as its initialism is also PSA. We also reviewed the

reference lists of previous meta-analyses for further studies for inclusion (6,8,12). Duplicate studies
were removed prior to download using the Ovid deduplication tool.

2.3 Data extraction
One author (SH) screened the titles and abstracts of all papers for inclusion and retrieved full texts
for all studies that met the inclusion criteria. Full texts were also sought if no abstract was available
or if the abstract did not include sufficient information to decide on inclusion. We also sought full
texts for conference abstracts, if a corresponding full text was not found in the original search. If no
full text could be found, and the abstract provided insufficient information for inclusion, the study
was excluded. We excluded one published paper where we could not locate a full text (13).

One author (SH) screened all full texts for inclusion, and one of three independent reviewers (KT, ET,
HJ) reviewed the first 60 full texts to check for consistency. We resolved any inconsistency with
discussion to clarify screening criteria. A random subset of the remaining studies (30 full texts) were
also reviewed by the independent reviewers to check for drift from inclusion/exclusion criteria.

Both SH and RL independently extracted all relevant data from included studies, with disagreements
resolved by discussion. The first ten extractions were also performed by HEJ, KT and ELT to check for
consistency.

We categorised prostate cancer studies as “before” if BMI was measured on average at least two
years before diagnosis (prospective studies), and “same time” if BMI was measured on average less
than two years before diagnosis. In general, “before” studies were cohort studies and “same time”
studies were case-control studies. We considered the “before” studies to be at lower risk of reverse
causation.

We extracted data that were (or could be transformed to) an odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR)
quantifying the continuous association between BMI and total and advanced prostate cancer risk,
and a regression coefficient for the association between BMI and log-PSA. Log-PSA was used as an
outcome rather than PSA as we assumed a multiplicative association between BMI and PSA, which
fits with the theory that haemodilution is responsible for any observed association (14).

and obese

(BMI

When several papers reported on the same study, for continuous associations we prioritised papers
that presented continuous effect estimates (e.g. HR or OR per 1 kg/m

increase in BMI) over papers

presenting categorical effect estimates (e.g. HR or OR for overweight and obese groups versus
normal weight), and these were prioritised over mean differences. For categorical associations, we
extracted

estimates

If

duplicate

studies

presented the same effect estimate types in multiple papers, the paper with the largest number of
participants was used in the meta-analysis. If both adjusted (e.g. for potential confounders such as
age, ethnicity, etc.) and unadjusted results were given in the same paper, the most-adjusted model
was used in the meta-analysis.

If the data were insufficient to estimate a regression coefficient, OR or HR and SE, we extracted a P
value, the number of participants and direction of association from the most relevant analysis for
use in an albatross plot (15).

2.4 Risk of bias assessment
SH and RL assessed the risk of bias in each study independently using an assessment tool created for
a

six categories: confounding,

selection of participants, missing data,

outcome measurement, exposure measurement and results’ reporting. We assigned overall and
category-specific risks of bias: either low, moderate, high, critical or unclear (if there was insufficient
information to assign a risk). We based the overall risk of bias on a subjective combination of the
category-specific risk of biases, looking at the maximum risk of bias that could have been introduced
into the study by each category. The overall risk of bias was not low in any study, as all studies were
observational and thus potentially subject to unmeasured confounding.

We determined that a study had a critical risk of bias if: i) age was not accounted for in either the
design or analysis of the study and, for BMI-prostate cancer case control studies, if there was more
than a 3-year difference in the mean or median ages of cases and controls, because age is strongly
associated with BMI (20), prostate cancer risk (21), and PSA (21); or ii) if the design of the study was
such that participation was conditional upon PSA levels, both for the association between BMI and
PSA (as this would involve conditioning on the outcome) and the association between BMI and
prostate cancer (as this would involve conditioning on a collider) (22).

Studies with a critical risk of bias were excluded prior to analysis and were not considered further.

In the studies found in the systematic review, it was generally unclear whether men considered as
not having prostate cancer had received biopsies. Usually, the controls were “not known to have
prostate cancer”, rather than “known not to have prostate cancer”. Therefore, screening could have
introduced bias in the association between BMI and prostate cancer. Although we did not consider
this a critical risk of bias, we sought to investigate and quantify this bias using large studies where
biopsy status was known, and IPD available.

However, we noted that some of the largest potentially relevant studies for our research questions
were screening studies, and that bias due to screening could potentially be accounted for using
imputation of prostate cancer status if IPD were available. This would then allow these studies to be
included in the meta-analyses.

We approached four prospective studies looking at prostate cancer to obtain IPD: Krimpen (23),
Prostate

Prevention

Trial

(PCPT)

(24),

Prostate,

Lung,

and

cancer

screening trial (PLCO) (25) and Prostate Testing for cancer and treatment trial (ProtecT) (26). These
studies were chosen because they were large studies of prostate cancer with known PSA screening
protocols, or the biopsy status of all participants was known. Key to informing the imputation model
was PCPT, which offered biopsies to all participants regardless of PSA level. This information allowed
us to impute prostate cancer status for men with a PSA level below the threshold for biopsy in the
other three studies. However, PCPT only included men with a PSA less than 3.0 ng/ml, biasing both
the BMI-PSA and BMI-prostate cancer analyses, and as such was excluded from the meta-analyses.

For each IPD study, we requested data measured at baseline on BMI and PSA, as well as age, family
history of prostate cancer and ethnicity. We also requested data on prostate cancer status (including
tumour, node, metastases [TNM] and Gleason scores). For each man who was not biopsied, we
imputed prostate cancer status by the end of the study in which he participated using multiple
imputation. We included baseline age, BMI, log-PSA, family history of prostate cancer, and study as
explanatory variables to impute prostate cancer status using logistic regression. BMI, log-PSA and
family history of prostate cancer were also imputed if missing.

In each of the three included IPD studies, we estimated associations between BMI and (1) prostate
cancer, (2) advanced prostate cancer and (3) PSA. We restricted the analyses to men with white
ethnicity (due

to low numbers of non-white

men and therefore difficulties in imputation), and

adjusted the analyses for age, family history of prostate cancer (for prostate cancer analyses), and
prostate cancer status (for the PSA analyses). Full details of the IPD studies, the imputation method
and statistical analyses are available in

Supplementary Appendix 3.

forest plots. Studies presenting HRs were all classed as “before” studies, and labelled simply “HR”.

In meta-analyses of categorical associations, studies from the systematic review were included if
they presented ORs or HRs for overweight and/or obese men relative to normal weight men (for the
outcomes of prostate cancer and advanced prostate cancer) or means and SDs of PSA or log-PSA for
each of these BMI categories (for the outcome of PSA). ORs and HRs that were presented for other

and

categories

categories

when

sufficient

information was available.

Meta-regression
Meta-regression (29) was used to determine if the effect estimates from individual studies included
in the meta-analyses varied by study-level factors. For all meta-regressions, we considered ethnicity
(non-white versus white in each study, defined as >80% white participants or from a country with a
majority white population), mid-year of recruitment, mean BMI in the study, and the overall risk of
bias (high versus medium). For the associations between BMI and prostate cancer and advanced
prostate cancer, we also considered the mean age at diagnosis, and study mean time between BMI
measurement and diagnosis.

Funnel plots
Funnel plots (30) were drawn to assess for small study effects in each analysis (31).

Albatross plots
As not all studies reported enough information to be included in the meta-analyses, we also present
albatross plots containing results from studies with and without sufficient information to be included
in the meta-analyses (32). These are plots of the P value of an association against the number of

data to contribute to meta-analysis on the albatross plots, we determined whether inclusion of the
remaining studies would have altered the overall interpretation of the evidence.

9,127 papers were found that had keywords for BMI and prostate cancer or PSA. After title
725 papers remained (see Figure 1, PRISMA flow diagram). After full text
screening, risk of bias assessment, and removal of papers reporting the same studies, 78 studies
examined the association between BMI and prostate cancer (67 with data for meta-analysis), 21
studies examined the association between BMI and advanced prostate cancer (18 with data for
meta-analysis), and 35 studies examined the association between BMI and PSA (20 with data for
meta-analysis, one of which only had data for categorical associations).

3.1 BMI and Prostate Cancer
Continuous BMI
Of the 78 studies examining the association between BMI and prostate cancer (23,25,26,33–107), 11
(14%) could not be included in the meta-analysis due to insufficient data but were included in the
albatross plot (97–107). All studies are detailed in
risk of bias assessment in

respectively. There was strong evidence for heterogeneity in effect estimates across studies for the
studies reporting an HR (P < 0.001, I

= 79.9%), and studies reporting an OR (P < 0.001, I

2

= 66.1%).

Pooled estimates from fixed effect meta-analyses were essentially the same.

From a meta-analysis including only IPD studies, the estimated average OR for prostate cancer for a

increase in BMI was 0.98 (95% CI 0.95 to 1.01) (

Categorical BMI
Thirteen of the studies included in the continuous meta-analyses above presented HRs or ORs for
overweight and/or obese men versus normal weight men (23,25,26,42,49,50,57,66–69,75,108). Only
ten studies presented HRs or ORs for overweight men, whereas all thirteen presented HRs or ORs for
obese men versus normal weight men. In total, there were 252,771 participants and 32,277 men
with prostate cancer included in this meta-analysis; two studies (50,108) did not report how many
men were in each BMI subgroup and were not included in these totals.

for prostate cancer between overweight and normal weight men was estimated to be 1.02 (95% CI
0.98 to 1.05, P = 0.35) with no evidence of heterogeneity (I

2

= 0.0%, P = 0.66), and the average OR

was estimated to be 0.99 (95% CI 0.91 to 1.08, P = 0.89, combined across ORs for BMI measured
before and at the same time as prostate cancer diagnosis) with little evidence of heterogeneity (I

2

=

34.7%, P = 0.18). The average HR for prostate cancer between obese and normal weight men was
estimated to be 0.97 (95% CI 0.93 to 1.01, P = 0.16), with no evidence of heterogeneity (I

2

= 0.0%, P =

0.80), and the average OR was estimated to be 0.90 (95% CI 0.81 to 1.00, P = 0.05, combined across
ORs), with some evidence of heterogeneity (I

2

= 41.3%, P = 0.10). Fixed-effect models gave very

similar results.

The heterogeneity in the average OR for prostate cancer between obese and normal weight men
may have been due to differences between IPD and non-IPD studies. There was no evidence of
heterogeneity for either IPD (OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.91 to 1.04, P = 0.46) or non-IPD (OR = 0.77, 95% CI
0.67 to 0.89, P < 0.001) studies when considered separately (I
respectively).

3,914 [4.1%] in OR studies). The random-effects meta-analyses (

estimated the

Categorical BMI
Six of the studies included in the continuous meta-analysis presented HRs or ORs for overweight
and/or obese men versus normal weight men (23,25,26,49–51). Only five studies presented results
for overweight versus normal weight men, whereas all six presented results for obese versus normal
weight men. In total, there were 169,530 participants included in this analysis, and 2,381 men had
advanced prostate cancer (1.4%) (one study (50) did not report how many men were in each BMI
subgroup and was not included in these totals).

3.2 BMI and PSA
Continuous BMI
Of the 34 studies providing information on the association between BMI (as a continuous variable)
and PSA (23,25,26,112–142), 15 studies (42%) could not be included in the meta-analysis due to
insufficient data but were included in an albatross plot (128–142). All included studies are detailed in

Supplementary Table 11, with the results of the risk of bias assessment in Supplementary Table 12.
In total, 264,970 men from 19 studies were included in the meta-analysis. The random-effects metaanalysis (

Figure 6) estimated the average percentage change in PSA for a 5 kg/m2 increase in BMI to

be -5.88% (95% CI -6.87% to -4.87%, P < 0.001). There was strong evidence for heterogeneity in
effect estimates across studies (I

2

= 60.0%, P <0.001). The fixed-effect analysis showed essentially

the same result with narrower confidence intervals (percentage change in PSA = -5.99%, 95% CI 6.48% to -5.49%, P < 0.001).

The

Categorical BMI
Sixteen of the studies included in the continuous meta-analysis presented PSA or log-PSA levels for
overweight and/or obese men and normal weight men (23,25,26,112–119,121,122,124,126,143),
and one further study presented only categorical results (144). Overall, there were 17 studies and
218,700 participants included in this analysis.

Supplementary Table 14 displays the average log-PSA in each BMI subgroup for all 17 included
studies, and Supplementary Table 15 displays the percentage MD in PSA for all comparisons. Forest
plots are presented in Supplementary Figures 13 and 14. For the random-effects meta-analysis, the
average percentage change in PSA between overweight and normal weight men was estimated to be
-3.43% (95% CI -5.57% to -1.23%, P = 0.002), with strong evidence of heterogeneity across studies (I

2

= 80.9%, P < 0.001), and the average percentage change in PSA between obese and normal weight
men was estimated to be -12.9% (95% CI -15.2% to -10.7%, P < 0.001), with strong evidence of
heterogeneity across studies (I

2

= 69.5%, P < 0.001). The pooled estimates from fixed-effect meta-

analyses were slightly lower for the change in PSA between overweight and normal weight men
(percentage change = -2.56%, 95% CI -3.34% to -1.78%, P < 0.001), but similar for the change in PSA
between obese and normal weight men (percentage change = -12.1%, 95% CI -13.2% to -11.1%, P <
0.001).

The difference in log-PSA between the obese and normal groups (-0.139) was almost four times the
difference between the overweight and normal weight groups (-0.035). The weighted mean BMI
across all

2

studies was 22.2 kg/m

2

category, and 31.3 kg/m

2

for the normal BMI category, 26.5 kg/m

for the overweight

for the obese category. We therefore consider this evidence that there is a

non-linear association between BMI and log-PSA.

4. Discussion
Overall Prostate Cancer
There was no compelling evidence to suggest there is a linear association between BMI and prostate
cancer

risk,

nor

an

association

between

being

overweight

and

prostate

cancer

risk,

and

little

evidence for an association between being obese and prostate cancer risk. However, there is likely a
reduced risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer in overweight/obese men due to the role of
PSA screening or testing in many prostate cancer diagnoses. This is reflected in our analyses of the
IPD studies: the complete case analysis in which we ignored the problem of incomplete diagnosis
(not all men being biopsied) suggested a negative association between BMI and prostate cancer. This
association was attenuated to the null after imputation of missing prostate cancer status in nonbiopsied men. This finding is consistent with our hypothesis regarding the expected direction of bias
due to the negative association of BMI with PSA.

Obese men with prostate cancer may also have a higher risk of missed diagnoses due to having
larger prostates (145), which are associated with a lower likelihood of detecting prostate cancer at
biopsy (146,147). Bias from PSA testing will be highest in populations with a high level of PSA
screening. In other populations, obesity may affect the chance of receiving a PSA test, and therefore
receiving a prostate cancer diagnosis, for example if obese men access primary care more.

Overall, our results are consistent with previous meta-analyses. A random-effects dose-response
meta-analysis of prospective studies was conducted by Markozannes et al. (2016) (4) using data
from the World Cancer Research Fund

(WCRF) as part of the continuous update project (148).

Markozannes included 39 studies with 3,798,746 participants and 88,632 men with prostate cancer
(2.3%)

for

the

association

between

BMI

and

prostate

cancer

(excluding

studies

on

mortality),

including many of the same studies we included in our meta-analysis. The pooled risk ratio (RR) for

2

prostate cancer for a 5 kg/m

increase in BMI was 1.00 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.03), consistent with our

results. In addition, an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analysis by Kyrgiou et al.
(2017)

(3)

concluded

that

there

was

no

strong

evidence

for

an

association

2

prostate cancer risk, with a summary OR for prostate cancer for a 5 kg/m

between

BMI

and

increase in BMI of 1.03

(95% CI 0.99 to 1.06).

Advanced Prostate Cancer
There was some evidence to suggest a linear association between BMI and the risk of advanced
prostate cancer, but only among studies reporting an HR (HR = 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.12, P = 0.013).
This association was not seen in studies reporting an OR, where most of the power came from the
imputed IPD studies, indicating the possibility of bias in the HR estimate due to PSA screening.
Additionally,

there

may

be

collider

bias

(22)

from

conditioning

on

prostate

cancer,

since

any

unmeasured confounders associated with both prostate cancer and advanced prostate cancer would
induce an

association

between

BMI and

advanced

prostate cancer.

However,

since

the

overall

association between BMI and prostate cancer appears to be negligible, this is not a primary concern.

Markozannes conducted a meta-analysis of prospective studies of BMI and combined advanced,
high-grade and fatal prostate cancer using WCRF data, which included 23 studies with 1,676,220
participants and 11,204 men with advanced/high-grade/fatal prostate cancer (0.67%) (4). The RR for

2

advanced/high-grade/fatal prostate cancer for a 5 kg/m

increase in BMI was 1.08 (95% CI 1.04 to

1.12). The effect estimate may be increased in the WCRF analysis by the inclusion of high-grade
and/or fatal prostate cancers or exclusion of case-control studies. Kyrgiou et al. (2017) (3) concluded
that there was weak evidence for a positive association between increasing BMI and advanced
prostate cancer risk, with a RR for advanced prostate cancer for a 5 kg/m

2

increase in BMI of 1.09

(95% CI 1.02 to 1.16), although our meta-analysis included more up-to-date studies with a stricter
inclusion criteria.

PSA
There was strong evidence of an inverse association between BMI and PSA, which we found to be
likely non-linear, decreasing more quickly between overweight and obese than normal weight and
overweight. On average, obese men have an estimated 12.9% lower PSA than a normal weight man,
and overweight men 3.4% lower PSA. We could only find one previous review of the association
between BMI and PSA, which did not include a meta-analysis or estimate effect size (158). Their
conclusion

was

that

many

studies

reported

an

inverse

association

between

BMI

and

PSA,

in

agreement with our findings.

It could thus be beneficial to account for BMI when interpreting the results of a PSA test. One
suggestion based on these results is to increase an overweight man’s PSA by 3.5% (multiply by
1.035) before comparing to a threshold, and an obese man’s PSA by 13% (11,149). As an example of
the impact of doing so, 23% of men in ProtecT were obese, and 1.9% of these men had an observed
PSA of less than 3.0 ng/ml, but a ‘corrected’ PSA above a 3.0 ng/ml threshold for biopsy when
adjusted for the effect of BMI on PSA.

Strengths and Limitations
We synthesised data from many studies, including participants from many different populations at
different

time

points,

improving

generalisability.

The

total

number

of

participants

included

in

analyses was also very large, and as such all pooled effect estimates were precise. By including
studies where BMI was measured before, and those where it was measured at the same time as
prostate

cancer

detection,

we

could

compare

different

study

types:

there

was little

difference

between these two study types for all outcomes in the continuous analyses, suggesting the findings
are

robust to reverse

causation

of BMI change

by PCa diagnosis.

By including IPD

studies and

imputing prostate cancer status in men who were not biopsied, we were able to show and account
for bias in the association between BMI and prostate cancer from PSA testing.

A further strength of this study was the inclusion of studies where only a P value and number of
participants could be extracted, using albatross plots.

However, there are limitations. Many of the studies included in the meta-analysis compared men
with

a diagnosis of prostate

cancer versus men

without a

diagnosis of prostate

cancer. In

the

screening studies, most men were not biopsied. Assuming that none of these men had prostate
cancer would be a strong assumption and likely lead to bias. We addressed this problem by treating
prostate cancer status as missing in these men and using multiple imputation. We performed checks
on the validity of our imputation model, but we note the limitation that our results may have been
sensitive to the choice of this model. In the meta-analysis of all studies, we limited bias due to
testing for prostate cancer with PSA by excluding studies that exclusively screened for prostate
cancer (and thus would have the greatest bias), but as PSA screening is used in general practice the
bias could not be entirely removed. The proportion of prostate cancers detected by testing with PSA
likely varied in each study, potentially accounting for some of the heterogeneity in studies examining
the association between BMI and prostate cancer and advanced prostate cancer. Indeed, all the
heterogeneity between OR results for prostate cancer between obese and normal weight men was
due to differences between the imputed IPD studies versus the non-IPD studies.

Overall, there were large amounts of heterogeneity between non-IPD studies in the continuous
analyses

of

BMI

and

prostate

cancer,

and

advanced

prostate

cancer.

This

could

be

due

to

heterogeneity across populations, methods of diagnosing prostate cancer, or differential adjustment
for confounders in each study-specific analysis. Equally, because the studies may not have used the

heterogeneous. This may have attenuated any association between BMI and advanced prostate
cancer.

There was also evidence of heterogeneity between studies examining the associations between BMI
and PSA. As with the prostate cancer studies, the PSA studies adjusted for different confounders,
therefore residual confounding may have increased heterogeneity. It is also possible the association
between

BMI

and

PSA

varies

by

population,

though

our

meta-regressions

did

not

find

any

explanatory factors.

There was at least a moderate risk of bias for all studies, as all studies were observational and
therefore could have been biased by unobserved confounding. We attempted to limit effects of bias
by identifying key confounders and only including studies without a critical risk of bias. There was
also

no

evidence

from

the

meta-regression

that

the

studies

with

a

medium

risk

of

bias

had

systematically different effect estimates than those with a high risk of bias.

In the categorical analyses, it was only possible to combine studies presenting results for specific
categories of BMI. As such, relatively few studies were included; a superior approach would be to
gather IPD from all eligible studies and to determine the precise form of any non-linear associations,
which would also allow more accurate corrections to men’s PSA levels.
