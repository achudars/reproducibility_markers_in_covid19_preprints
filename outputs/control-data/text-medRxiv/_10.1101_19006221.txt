Abstract
Children of older fathers have higher risk for certain diseases. Nevertheless, how ageing
specifically affects male germ cells is so far not completely understood. In a cohort of 197
healthy men (18-84 years), we found that semen and reproductive parameters remained
normal over six decades. Along with an age-dependent increase in telomere length in sperm
(r=0.41, p>0.001), we found accelerated DNA fragmentation, more prominent after the sixth
decate of life, and with around 60% of men older than 66 showing abnormal levels of DNA
breaks. At the epigenetic level, by whole genome bisulfite sequencing we identified 236
sperm-specific differentially methylated regions between the youngest and oldest group,
affecting mostly regions associated with homeobox genes and nervous system development.
Therefore, we propose that during ageing, male germ cells are affected by an intrinsic and
specific ageing process, distinguishable from the soma. These age-dependent changes
might have consequences for fertility and offspring of older men.

Introduction
In developed countries, couples postpone parenthood mainly for socio-political and cultural
reasons (1–3). The reproductive implications of delaying fatherhood, such as a decline of
sperm parameters (e.g. sperm count, motility, and morphology) and disruptions in
reproductive hormone secretion (4), have long been undervalued. In fact, if and how ageing
itself causes a decline in men’s reproductive health is unclear because selection criteria for
clinical studies are inconsistent and some studies indicate only a subtle change during
ageing (5, 6) which might in part be due to unhealthy lifestyles or age-related somatic
diseases (7). Observational studies have indicated that the partners of elderly men take
longer to become pregnant and that these pregnancies have higher rates of spontaneous
abortion (8–10). Recently, advanced paternal age has been shown to have adverse
consequences for maternal and offspring health (11). In spite of this, knowledge of how
ageing specifically affects the quality of male germ cells remains limited.
The increasing number of pre-meiotic cell divisions in the human male germline leads to an
increase in de novo mutation rates in children of older men (12, 13). In line with this, there is
an association between paternal age and incidence of so called paternal age effect (PAE)
disorders (14). Still, the mechanism by which PAE arise is not completely understood.
Among the hypotheses put forward to explain the detrimental effects of age on male fertility
and offspring health, epigenetic changes to the DNA stand out. Changes in DNA methylation
accumulate in the male germline with age (15–17), however only a small portion of all CpG
sites in the genome have so far been interrogated.
Our unique cross-sectional observation study on healthy ageing men [Fertility and Ageing in
Healthy Men (FAMe)] was conducted in order to exclude the effects of age-related mobidities
and evaluate the impacts of age to male reproductive health. Our ultimate goal was to
identify the fundamental processes involved in male germline ageing which are caused
exclusively by age.

Results
Reproductive parameters in healthy ageing men
We evaluated reproductive parameters in 197 healthy men, who were stratified into six age
groups (Table 1). We did not observe any age-related changes in testicular volume or semen
parameters beyond or below the normal ranges given by the WHO (18). Subtle, but
significant age-dependent processes such as a decrease of ejaculate volume, changes in
sperm motility, and a decrease in markers for accessory gland function, e.g. zinc were clearly
visible, however all changes remained within the given physiological range (Table 2).

Similar observations were made regarding reproductive endocrine parameters. Although
there was a slight age-dependent increase in FSH, LH, and SHBG and a decrease in free
testosterone, all hormone levels stayed within the normal range (Table 3). A similar scenario
was observed when evaluating anthropometric parameters and questionnaires for (sexual)
wellbeing (Table 4).

Molecular signatures of male germ cells in healthy ageing men
We investigated to what extent hallmarks of ageing previously established in somatic cells,
such as telomere attrition, loss of genome stability, and epigenetic alterations, are affected in
human sperm from ageing men.
We found an inverse association between age and blood rTL (r=-0.41, p=3.27x10-9),
indicating the shortening of telomeres with age in somatic cells (Figure 1A). In contrast, there
was a positive association of similar strength between age and sperm rTL (r=0.41,
p=3.37x10-8), demonstrating that telomeres in the germline become longer with increasing
age. Moreover, the rate at which telomeres shorten in blood DNA (0.0055 relative units per
year) is slower than the rate that they lengthen in sperm (0.0077 relative units per year).

Figure 1. Relative Telomere Length (rTL) sperm DNA and sperm DNA fragmentation changes with
age. A. rTL was measured in peripheral blood (left; n=194) and swim-up sperm (right; n=179) DNA.
Linear trends are displayed in blue and 95% confidence interval in grey shading. The correlation
coefficients (Pearson’s) and p values are indicated for each case. B. The percentage of men with a
sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI) higher than 30%, considered to negatively affect fertility,
increased with age (n=169).

Genome instability was assessed in the paternal genome by measuring DNA fragmentation,
in particular single- and double-strand DNA breaks (19). In the sperm of healthy men, we
observed a highly significant increase in DFI with increasing age (ρ=0.57; p=1.04x10-15).
Possible confounding parameters, such as abstinence time and sperm vitality, had little or no
effect on this association (Table S1). While we found that the DFI continuously and steadily
increased over the different age groups until the age of 55 years (Groups 1-4), a marked
acceleration in genome instability was noted in the two oldest age groups (groups 5 and 6;
Figure 1B), with almost 60% of men over the age of 66 showing DFI above 30%, which is
considered the threshold for normal DFI (20).
Another hallmark of ageing seen in somatic cells is epigenetic drift, in which DNA methylation
changes occur with age. As a proxy for assessing global DNA methylation in tissues or cells,
we measured the DNA methylation of LINE-1 repetitive elements in bisulfite-converted blood
DNA from our cohort, but did not find any age-related methylation changes (Figure S1).
The stability of LINE-1 methylation suggests that any age-dependent changes to the
methylome might occur at unique regions in the genome. Using deep bisulfite sequencing
(DBS), we assessed the sperm DNA methylation levels of regions previously found to be

aberrantly methylated and associated with reduced fertility (21). These included two
imprinted genes (H19 and MEST) and four spermatogenesis-specific genes (FGFR3, VASA,
RHOXF1, and RHOXF2/2B). In parallel, we also analysed blood DNA to exclude a general
age-related tissue-independent effect. There were only minor differences detected between
the younger (n=14, age range 18-25) and older (n=14; age range 61-71) age groups in DNA
methylation levels of H19 and VASA in blood DNA and in FGFR3 in sperm DNA (Figure S2).
It is therefore likely that age-dependent changes to the methylome are located at genomic
loci not previously associated with male infertility.
In order to explore age-dependent methylation changes in sperm in an unbiased and
genome-wide manner, we performed whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) on 6
samples each of sperm DNA from the two extreme age groups (Group 1 vs. Groups 5+6).
For comparison, blood DNA from the same men were prepared and sequenced. There were
no differences in mean DNA methylation between age groups or between tissues (Table S2;
confirmation of purity of samples shown in Figure S3).
Differentially methylated regions (DMRs; with at least 4 CpGs and 30% mean methylation
difference) between the extreme groups were identified using two different algorithms
(BSmooth and Metilene (22, 23)). We identified a total of 236 DMRs (Supplementary File 1)
in sperm and 36 in blood. Of the sperm DMRs, 121 increased and 115 decreased
methylation with age. Notably, there was no overlap between the age-associated sperm
DMRs and blood DMRs, consequently only the sperm DMRs were analysed further by
bioinformatic and analytical tools. We did not find any chromosomal preference or hotspot for
the observed sperm methylation changes (Figure S4).
Analysing the identified sperm DMRs, we noticed a significant overrepresentation of DNA
transposons (p=9.59x10-4) and LINE elements (p=6.21x10-3), but no significant over- or
underrepresentation of either LTRs or SINE (Figure S5).
A subset of 11 sperm DMRs was chosen for further in-depth analysis and used to confirm
findings in samples from all of the age groups using DBS (Table S3). In addition to the 12

samples originally analysed by WGBS, 30-63 sperm samples, equally distributed throughout
the six age groups, were randomly selected. By DBS analyses, we confirmed that seven out
of eleven DMRs (BS21, BS74, BS134, ML15, BS71, and BS174) had a statistically
significant correlation between DNA methylation levels and age. Two DMRs (BS46 and
ML12) showed a similar trend as identified by WGBS, but the correlation with age was not
statistically significant. Two other DMRs (BS88 and BS130) displayed a non-linear pattern of
age-related methylation change (Figure 2).

Figure 2. Evaluation of DMRs for age-dependent changes by DBS. Eleven age-associated
differentially methylated regions (DMRs) identified by WGBS of sperm of young (G1) and old (G5-6)
men were further analysed in all age groups (n≥7 for each group) by DBS. A statistically significant
correlation (Spearman’s rank correlation) with age was detected for seven of these DMRs. Only
statistically significant correlation results are displayed in each graph. The linear trend line is shown in
blue and the LOWESS curve in dashed orange, with respective 95% confidence levels in grey
shading.

The correlation between age and methylation of the different DMRs was adjusted for the
possible confounder MTHFR C677T genotype, previously shown to influence DNA
methylation. However, we could not observe an overall significant effect of this polymorphism
on DNA methylation of the regions analysed.

We used six DMRs with p<0.001 (BS74, BS134, ML15, BS22, BS71 and BS174) and a
regression analysis of donor-wise average methylation levels to derive an age predictor for
sperm. By leave-one-out cross-validation (24), we found a strong correlation between
predicted and chronological ages for the 42 initially analysed samples. An additional set of 33
samples were independently analysed, confirming this strong correlation (Figure 3; R script
available in Supplementary File 2). Taking the two sample sets together, we found a strong
correlation (r=0.78; p=3.83x10-16) between chronological and predicted age and a mean
absolute error of 8.7 years.

Figure 3. Sperm age predictor. The average methylation values of the six DMRs with a p<0.01 were
used for regression analysis to develop an age-predictor. The predicted age, as determined by leaveone-out cross-validation, is plotted against the chronological age in blue for 12 probands from the
WGBS discovery cohort and 30 additional probands, with the linear trend displayed in blue and 95%
confidence interval in grey shading. An independent sample cohort (n=33) was analysed and the age
predictor tool could be successfully applied to calculate the predicted age (results in orange). The
calculated mean absolute error including all the samples was +/- 8.7 years, with a Pearson correlation
coeficient of 0.78 (p=3.83x10-16).

In order to analyse the functional importance and potential biological impact of the 236 sperm
DMRs, a list with the upstream and downstream neighbouring genes (distance from TSS

≤1000 kb) was obtained. Gene ontology (GO) analysis of the DMR-associated gene list
showed a significant enrichment for Homeobox genes (16 genes; padj=2.0x10-2) and other
DNA binding protein gene families (58 genes; padj =4.3x10-2). Gene set enrichment analysis

Discussion
The FAMe study of healthy ageing men delineates for the first time an inherent ageing
process that take place in germ cells during spermatogenesis by minimizing the effects of
confounding factors. Considering the hallmarks of ageing already known for other tissues
and cells, it is evident that male germ cells age, but the ageing process is different from that
of somatic cells.
Good general health seems to be an essential requirement for good reproductive health,
regardless of age, while severe male infertility appears to be associated with increased
morbidities (25). Our andrological evaluation revealed that sperm production is not affected
by age in a clinically relevant way. These findings contrast with several studies which
showed a decline in endocrine and spermatogenic function with age (4, 6, 26). This is likely
due to the strict health criteria applied during our volunteer recruitment, which were not used
in most previous studies. Our results are in complete agreement with a previous study which
also applied strong selection criteria (27). A possible limitation of this study is that we do not
have longitudinal data, and therefore we cannot exclude an influence of the year of birth on
the data.
We have found a negative correlation between age and blood rTL and a positive correlation
of similar strength between age and sperm rTL, demonstrating an extension of telomeres in
the germline with increasing age. This is presumably due to telomerase activity in the
germline (28). The increased rate of telomere lengthening in sperm than telomere shortening
in blood is in accordance with Aston et al. (29). There is evidence that very long sperm
telomeres are detrimental to fertility (30). The age-dependent increase of telomeres in sperm
could also result in increased telomere length in the progeny of elderly fathers; however, how
this might affect their general health is currently unclear (31).
In our cohort, DFI increased with age, indicating increased genomic instability in the
germline. Previous studies have shown that an increase in DFI above 30% is associated with
male infertility (20). Consequently, the fertility of elderly men might be impaired by increased

DNA instability, contributing to previously reported longer time to pregnancy and higer
miscarriage rates irrespective of female partner age (32, 33). The number of men with DFI
levels above 30% increased more dramatically in groups 5 and 6 (>56 years; Figure 1B),
affecting close to 60% of the volunteers in the oldest group, pointing to an accelerated
increase in DNA damage, a pattern of DNA instability hitherto unknown.
To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating age-related methylation changes in all
CpG dinucleotides across the human sperm genome. We identified over 200 DMRs in
sperm, none of which overlaped with DMRs identified in blood in this study or with any of the
353 CpGs from Horvath’s epigenetic clock (34). This strongly supports the notion that
epigenetic ageing in the male germline differs from somatic cell ageing.
For a majority of the DMRs validated by DBS, a significant linear pattern of hyper- or
hypomethylation with age was evident. The range of methylation changes observed was
remarkable. For example, the mean methylation decreased from 87% to 46% (for ML15) and
increased from 32% to 62% (for BS71) with age. Two candidate DMRs (BS88 and BS139)
showed a non-linear pattern which might indivate a strong impact of other factors (e.g.
genetic background). DNA methylation in sperm has been previously shown to be affected
by genetic variants, such as MTHFR polymorphisms, however we could not find any
influence of this variation on the DNA methylation levels of the analysed DMRs.
The inter-individual variation in DNA methylation was very low in most DMRs validated,
which allowed us to devide an epigenetic age-predictor for sperm based on six of these
regions. Recently, an epigenetic clock for sperm has been published by Jenkins et al. (16),
which is more precise than our own. One reason for this difference may be the narrower age
range in their cohort (20-60 years) and also that our predictor is based on only six regions.
We think the two epigenetic clocks might complement each other, as they likely reflect
different factors. Jenkins’ study cohort includes clinically heterogeneous sperm samples,
including infertile patients, and therefore their clock may reflect not only the effect of age but
also other factors such as age-related morbidities. In contrast, our data are based on a highly

selected population of healthy men and therefore can be used for tracking the influence of
health, fertility, lifestyle, and treatment on the ageing status of the germline.
Gene ontology analyses of genes in the vicinity of the identified sperm DMRs indicate an
enrichment of biological processes involved in nervous system and head development
(Figure 4). A similar finding was reported previously (15). Although it is tempting to speculate
that there might be a link between this finding and the increased frequency of
neuropsychiatric disorders in the offspring of older men, there is currently no experimental
support for such a hypothesis.
A crucial question emerges from our study: what is the origin of the epigenetic changes in
sperm? It is unlikely that DNA methylation is altred during spermiogenesis, where DNA is
tightly packed with protamines and therefore inaccessible for transcription factor binding and
modification by enzymes. The spermatogenial stem cells migh be a source of the observed
changes. At 60 years of age, it is estimated that a spermatogonia has undergone
approximately 920 mitotic cell divisions (35), making them prone to replication errors and
resulting in increased mutation rates. It is therefore likely that male germ cells are also prone
to increased DNA methylation maintenance errors as they age. Moreover, to maintain sperm
production levels, testes of older men require require activation and recruitment of additional,
otherwise quiescent, spermatogonia (36). This changed spermatogonial activity pattern could
cause the observed methylation, and even DNA instability, changes. In addition, similarly to
what happens with mutations (35), certain DNA methylation changes might confer a selective
advantage to some spermatogonia, which would contribute more to the spermatogenic
output with increasing age. This would indicate that two further hallmarks of ageing,
spermatogonial stem cell replication stress and clonal drift, could contribute significantly to
the ageing of the male germline.
In summary, healthy ageing is strongly associated with good reproductive health, with normal
semen parameters being maintained over a six decades-long period. However, this starkly
contrasts with intrinsic ageing processes occurring in the male germline, such as telomere

lengthening, increasing genome instability, and DNA methylation changes at specific sites.
These molecular changes might contribute to the reduced fertility and fecundity in older men.
It has been previously advised that genetic counselling should be provided for couples
undergoing ART when the male partner is over 49 years of age (37, 38). Our data support
this recommendation, but further work will be necessary in the future to understand whether
the molecular changes to sperm DNA have consequences to progeny health, to set precise
age thresholds, and ultimately whether fertility preservation options (e.g. sperm
cryopreservation) should be offered to men while they are still young.

Materials and Methods
Ethics
All participants gave informed written consent for performing the examinations, evaluation of
clinical data and genetic analysis of the DNA samples according to protocols approved by
the Ethics Committee of the Medical Faculty in Münster (2013-255-f-S).
Participants
Participants were recruited through advertisements in local newspapers, internet, and
hospitals. The recruitment and clinical evaluation/selection of the participants took place
between October of 2014 and April of 2016. Prospective participants (above the age of 18)
were first asked to fill an online questionnaire. Exclusion criteria in the questionnaire included
smoking within the previous year, illegal drug consumption, regular use of medication (except
for

the

treatment

of

mild

hypertension,

hypothyroidism,

and

dyslipoproteinemia),

hospitalization within the previous month, current or former cancer/cancer treatment, severe
chronic renal failure, chronic viral infection, urogenital malformations and surgeries, prior
diagnosis or treatment for fertility impairment, chromosomal alterations, and participation in
clinical trials within the previous year. 265 selected volunteers were invited to the outpatient
clinic of the CeRA for clinical evaluation and sample collection. 65 volunteers dropped out for
unwillingness or inability to make it to the appointment. 200 men underwent a thorough
anthropometric, endocrine, and andrological evaluation, which was accompanied by several
questionnaires addressing their wellbeing and sexual health. Two participants were further
excluded due to the discovery of assymptomatic tumours during the clinical examination. 197
participants were ultimately included in the study.
Physical examination included measurement of body weight, height, blood pressure, pulse,
and electrocardiogram. Blood samples were collected under fasting conditions and used for
DNA isolation, hormone measurements, haematological analysis including metabolic
parameters as blood lipids, HbA1c and blood glucose. Ultrasound of the thyroid, carotid

arteries, kidneys, bladder, testicles, epididymis, prostate, and seminal vesicles (transrectal)
in addition to palpation of breast, external genitalia, and digital rectal examination were
performed. The volunteers were also asked to provide at least 2 semen samples in two
separate visits, with an abstinence time of 2 -7 days. The semen samples were analysed in
our andrological lab in accordance with the WHO criteria (18). A microbiological analysis of
semen was performed and swim-up sperm was prepared (18) and stored for further
analyses. All collected data were stored in our in-house clinical database, Androbase (39).
Grouping was done in 10 year intervals, except for groups 1 (18-24 years) and 6 (> 65 years;
range 65 - 82 years), the latter due to the difficulties in recruiting sufficient numbers of
healthy men above 75 years of age (Table 1).
Questionnaires
General wellbeing including personal medical history, life time smoking habits, socioeconomic factors, and family medical history were analysed using four different
questionnaires. Clinical symptoms of age-related hypogonadism were evaluated using the
Aging Males Symptoms (AMS) rating scale (40). Erectile function was assessed with the
international index of erectile function (IIEF) (41, 42). The evaluation of clinical symptoms
caused by an enlargement of the prostate was measured by the International Prostate
Symptom Score questionnaire (43). Quality of daily sleep was assessed by the Epworth
sleepiness scale (44).
Hormone measurements
Hormonal parameters (LH, FSH, T, SHBG, prolactin, estradiol, PSA) were measured using a
chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (Architect

i1000;

Abbott

Diagnostics,

Wiesbaden, Germany). DHT was measured using an in-house radio-immunoassay. All blood
samples were obtained in a fasting state after 15 minutes of rest. Methods are validated
quarterly against LC-MS/MS.

DNA Fragmentation Index (DFI) determination
Measurement of DNA fragmentation was performed as described previously (45). For the
flow cytometer setup and calibration, a reference sample was used from a normal donor.
Data were analysed using the FCS 3.0 software package (DeNovo software, Los Angeles,
CA, USA). A DNA fragmentation index (DFI) for every detected sperm was calculated
according to the formula: red/(red + green) fluorescence. DFI values were plotted in a
histogram and sperm with denatured DNA (high DFI values) were those located to the right
of the main, normal population.
DNA isolation and bisulfite conversion
Blood DNA was isolated using EDTA-blood using the FlexiGene DNA kit (Qiagen) according
to the instructions supplied by the manufacturer and as previously described (46). Sperm
DNA was isolated using MasterPure DNA purification kit (Epicentre Biotechnologies,
Madison, WI, USA) and a modified protocol (46). DNA concentration was measured by
spectrophotometry (NanoDrop ND-1000, Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). DNA samples were
stored at -20ºC until further use.
For LINE-1 DNA methylation determination, DNA was bisulfite converted using the EpiTect
kit (Qiagen). Briefly, 200 ng blood DNA were bisulfite converted using Qiagen EpiTect
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The converted DNA was eluted in 20 μL Buffer
EB.
For Deep Bisulfite Sequencing (DBS), 200 ng blood and sperm DNA were bisulfite converted
using the EZ DNA Methylation Gold kit (Zymo Research, Freiburg, Germany) according to
the provided instructions, and the DNA was eluted in 10 μL.
Relative Telomere Length Determination
Mean relative telomere length (rTL) was measured on blood and swim-up sperm DNA by
quantitative PCR (qPCR) using a previously described method (47), modified from (48).

Briefly, the cycle threshold (Ct) value for telomeric repeats (T) and a single-copy gene [S;
haemoglobin subunit gamma (HBG)] were determined for each sample and the rTL was
calculated as the ratio between T and S. A standard curve was generated using reference
DNA ranging from 0.37 to 90 ng from 10 randomly selected subjects. Measurements for
subjects and reference samples were carried out in triplicates. Amplification mixture
contained 10 µl QuantiTect SYBR® green PCR Master Mix (2x; Qiagen), 2 µl blood DNA
(12,5 ng/μl), 1 µl primer either for telomeric repeats (forward 2 µM, reverse 18 µM; Eurofins
MWG) or HBG (forward 6 µM, reverse 14 µM; Eurofins MWG; Table S4, 2 µl DTT (25 mM),
and nuclease free water to a total volume of 20 µl.
LINE-1 methylation determination
The DNA methylation of LINE-1 repetitive elements was quantified using PyroMark Q24 CpG
LINE-1 kit (Qiagen) according to the procedure advised by the manufacturer.
Library preparation and sequencing
Sperm and blood DNA, respectively, from six “young” men (18-24 years) and six “old” men
(61-71 years) were pooled at equimolar ratios. We used pooled DNA to minimize the effect of
inter-individual DNA methylation differences (49–51). For each of the 4 pools, two shotgun
libraries were generated. Standard pre-bisulfite libraries were prepared from 2 μg of DNA
according to the original Illumina protocol essentially as described by Rademacher et al. (52).
Tagmentation libraries were prepared from 20 ng of DNA using the Nextera transposase
(Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and a modified protocol (personal communication from G.
Gasparoni and J. Walter, University of Saarland). Bisulfite conversion was performed with
the EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), followed by 10 and 12
cycles of PCR, respectively. For each sample, we sequenced two lanes of the Illumina library
and one lane of the tagmentation library on an Illumina HiSeq 2500, again as described
previously (52).

Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) data was deposited at the European Nucleotide
Archive under the accession number PRJEB28044.
Read mapping and methylation calling
Raw reads were aligned with bwa-meth (v0.2.0) (53) to the human reference genome
(hs37d5) with default parameters. Aligned reads were sorted and indexed, duplicates were
detected, and alignment metrics were extracted by sambamba (v.0.6.6) (54). Methylation
levels at CpG dinucleotides were called by an in-house script, which considers only CpGs
located on the reference genome.
DMR detection
Differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected by Metilene (v.0.2-7) (23) and by an
in-house script based on Bsmooth (22) as they detect preferentially shorter and longer
DMRs, respectively. We removed the smoothing and detect differentially methylated CpGs
(DMCs) by t-test as previously described (22). Adjacent differentially methylated cytosines
(DMCs) are merged into a DMR if they are separated by not more than two non-DMCs.
DMRs containing four DMCs and a minimum of 0.3 (i.e. 30%) average group methylation
difference between these DMCs were selected.
Deep Bisulfite Sequencing (DBS)
Primer sets (Table S4) were designed for a selection of the detected DMRs using
MethPrimer

(55)

(http://www.urogene.org/cgi-bin/methprimer/methprimer.cgi)

and

MethPrimer 2.0 (http://www.urogene.org/cgi-bin/methprimer2/MethPrimer.cgi). Only DMRs
not overlaping with repetitive sequences were selected, in order to generate highly specific
primer sequences. DMR-specific libraries were constructed by two rounds of PCR as
previously described (46, 56). Sample preparation and sequencing were performed as
previously described (56) using the Roche/454 GS Junior system (Roche Diagnostics,
Manheim, Germany) and yield of reads was increased by applying a special filter setting

(57). A power analysis was performed to find the minimum number of samples to be
analysed (p<0.05 and β<0.2, large effect size).
Methylation analysis was performed using Amplikyzer (58), and average methylation for each
amplicon and each CpG site, as well as methylation plots, were retrieved for each sample.
Gene Ontology Analysis
Annotation of the DMRs was performed by searching the nearest genes within 100 kb. The
resulting gene list was submitted to DAVID (59) was used for gene ontology, using the whole
human genome as backgroun. GSEA (60) was used for gene set enrichment analysis using
the Molecular Signatures Database (MsigDB).
Overlap of DMRs with repeats
Repeat tracks produced by RepeatMasker (61) were retrieved by the UCSC Table Browser
(62). Separated BED files for the four different types of repeats were generated and
intersected with CpG positions. This results in four BED files, each containing CpGs located
in the respective repeat regions. CpGs of DMRs located in repeat regions were then
identified by intersecting the DMRs in BED format with each of the four files. All operations
on BED files are performed by BEDTools (v2.25.0) (63).
We estimated the p-value for over- and underrepresented repeat overlaps by simulating 1
million datasets, consisting of 236 regions each and equal size distribution compared to our
DMRs, while each region contains at least 4 CpGs. For each of our 236 DMRs and each
region of the simulated datasets, the fraction of repeat-overlapping CpGs was detected. We
then compared the mean fraction f for our DMRs and each of the 1 million random sets F'.
The empirical p-value for overrepresentation is the fraction of random sets f'

∈ F' with

f > f'

(symmetrically, for underrepresentation). This was performed independently for each type of
repeat.

Epigenetic age-predictor
Let X be the set of Donors, D our six selected DMRs, mx(d) be the average methylation level
(if available) for DMR d ∈ D and donor x ∈ X and a(x) its age.
We use the set Ti,j = {(mx(di), mx(dj), a(x)) for x
predictor pi,j for each pair (di, dj)

∈ D2 with

∈ X} to separately train a ridge regression (64)

0 <= i < j < |D|, while elements with at least one

missing methylation value for x are removed from Ti,j.
Each pi,j is able to predict an age a'i,j(x) = pi,j(mx(di), mx(dj)) given average methylation of x for
di and dj. Let then a'(x) be the average of all single predictions for x.
In a second step we use all pairs T'i,j = {(a'(x), a(x)) for x

∈

X} to train an additional simple

linear regression model q. The final predicted age for x is is q(a'(x)).
Statistics
For each analysed variable, normality of the distribution and homogeneity of variance were
tested before determining the most adequate statistical test to use. Two-sided t-tests were
used to compare betweens between two groups. Pearson’s test was used to test correlations
between age and normally distributed variables. Spearman’s rank correlation was used when
the variables were not normally distributed or presented outliers. Adjustment for confounders
was done by partial correlation analysis. All statistical analysis and graph plotting were
performed using R 3.3.1 and suitable R packages.
