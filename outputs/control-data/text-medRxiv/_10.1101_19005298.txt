Abstract:

7

In 2018-2019, New York City experienced the largest measles outbreak in the US in nearly three

8

decades. To identify key factors contributing to this outbreak to aid future public health

9

interventions, here we developed a model-inference system to infer the transmission dynamics of

10

measles in the affected community, based on incidence data. Our results indicate that delayed

11

vaccination of young children aged 1-4 years enabled the initial spread of measles and that

12

increased infectious contact among this age group, likely via gatherings intended to expose

13

unvaccinated children (i.e. "measles parties"), further aggravated the outbreak and led to

14

widespread of measles beyond this age group. We found that around half of infants were

15

susceptible to measles by age 1 (the age-limit to receive the first vaccine dose in the US); as

16

such, infants experienced a large number of infections during the outbreak. We showed that

17

without the implemented vaccination campaigns, the outbreak severity including numbers of

18

infections and hospitalizations would be 10 times higher and predominantly affect infants and

19

children under 4. These results suggest that recommending the first vaccine dose before age 1

20

and the second dose before age 4 could allow pro-vaccine parents to vaccinate and protect

21

infants and young children more effectively, should high level of vaccine hesitancy persist. In

22

addition, enhanced public health education is needed to reduce activities that unnecessarily

23

expose children to measles and other infections.

Introduction

25

Measles is highly contagious and severe viral disease. Thanks to a highly effective vaccine and

26

high coverage of vaccination, endemic transmission of measles—i.e. continuous transmission for

27

more than 12 months—in the US was declared eliminated in 2000. However, due to vaccine

28

hesitancy and declining vaccination rate, in recent years there have been an increasing number of

29

large outbreaks following introduction of measles infection (1). Due to long-term fluctuations in

30

vaccine coverage and infection history, population susceptibility could vary substantially by age

31

group. This susceptibility disparity by age can further interact with age-specific social

32

connectivity (i.e., contact rate) to shape the epidemic trajectory. As such, understanding these

33

detailed population characteristics as well as their impact on transmission dynamics in the recent

34

outbreaks is important for devising timely and effective intervention strategies.

35
36

In the fall of 2018, several New York City (NYC) residents acquired measles while

37

traveling abroad and subsequently led to the largest measles outbreak in the US in nearly three

38

decades. The first case of this outbreak developed a rash on Sep 30, 2018 and as of Aug 6, 2019

39

(at the time of this writing), there have been 642 confirmed cases, largely occurring in an

40

Orthodox Jewish community (2, 3). To contain the outbreak, the NYC Department of Health and

41

Mental Hygiene (DOHMH) launched extensive vaccination campaigns and, on Apr 9, 2019,

42

ordered mandatary vaccination of all individuals living, working or going to school in the

43

affected zip codes. As a result, over 32 thousand individuals under 19 years were vaccinated with

44

the measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine during Oct 2018 – July 2019 and the outbreak

45

subsided (3, 4).

47

In this study, we model the transmission dynamics of this measles outbreak in the

48

affected Orthodox Jewish community in NYC from Oct 1, 2018 to July 31, 2019, months with

49

more than one measles cases reported. Using an age-structured model-inference framework, we

50

are able to estimate key epidemiological features including the initial susceptibilities in five

51

different age groups (i.e., <1, 1-4, 5-17, 18-49, and 50+ years) and the basic reproductive number

52

R0, infer key factors contributing to the spread of measles, estimate the proportions of infection

53

attributable to each age group, as well as assess the impact of vaccination campaigns. We also

54

discuss the implications of our findings to current measles vaccination policies.

Results

57

Overview of the measles outbreak and model fit

58

The measles outbreak started on Sep 30, 2018, when a young child developed a rash. It evolved

59

relatively slowly in the first three months; however, the outbreak took off quickly in early 2019,

60

peaked in April after the city declaring a public health emergence, and recorded a total of 642

61

cases by July 31, 2019. As shown in Fig. 1, age-grouped incidence, estimated based on health

62

reports/alerts (3, 5), peaked first in Mar 2019 among 1-4 year-olds—the age group with the

63

largest number of infection (275 cases or 42.8% of the total, as of Aug 6, 2018), followed by <1

64

year-olds (100 cases or 15.6%) and 5-17 year-olds (138 cases or 21.5%) in Apr 2019, and 18+

65

year-olds (129 cases or 20.1%) in May 2019.

66
67

As shown in Fig. 2 and Table S2, our model-filter system was able to recreate the overall

68

incidence curve during Oct 2018 – July 2019, estimate the overall age distribution of measles

69

cases, as well as recreate the estimated age-grouped incidence curves for all age groups. Note

70

that while our model (Eqn 1) divided 18+ year-olds into two subgroups (i.e. 18-49 and 50+

71

years) given their differences in contact rates and interactions with other age-groups, we present

72

the combined results here because data were only available for the entire age group. The

73

estimated reporting rate was around 90% throughout the study period and slightly lower in Apr

74

2019, at the peak of the outbreak [89.1%, 95% credible interval (CI): 79.4, 99.2%; Fig. S2].

75
76

Inference of key epidemiological characteristics

77

The model-filter system estimated that, at the beginning of the outbreak (i.e. Sep 2018),

78

susceptibility was the highest in infants, at approximately 53.2% (95% CI: 49.0, 57.5%; Fig.

79

3A). This was expected, because maternal immunity wanes within 3 to 9 months after birth and,

80

as a result, by their first birthday—the age eligible to receive the first dose of MMR vaccine in

81

the US—almost all infants have lost their maternal immunity and are susceptible to measles.

82

Young children aged 1-4 years had the second highest susceptibility; approximately 24.9% (95%

83

CI: 20.4, 29.7%) were susceptible. In comparison, susceptibility was lower among both 5-17

84

year-olds (6.0%, 95% CI: 4.1, 7.9%) and 18+ year-olds 6.0% (95% CI: 4.4, 7.6%; Fig. 3). These

85

estimates were consistent with the observation that all cases recorded in Oct 2018 were children

86

ranging from 11 months to 4 years (2). Sensitivity analysis on assumptions related to the

87

vaccination campaigns showed that estimated susceptibilities were slightly higher for 5-18 year-

88

olds (7.5%, 95% CI: 5.1, 9.9%) and 18-49 year-olds (7.9%, 95% CI: 5.2, 9.9%) if more vaccine

89

doses were given to the Jewish Orthodox community or 5-18 year-olds; however, the estimates

90

were in general consistent with the baseline scenario (Table S2).

92

The initial vaccination campaigns launched promptly afterwards lowered the

93

susceptibility to 40.3% (95% CI: 36.4, 44.0%) in infants and 13.9% (95%: 9.7, 18.7%) in 1-4

94

year-olds, by the end of Dec 2018 (Fig. 3). These efforts along with other transmission and

95

infection controls (2) appeared to effectively contain the outbreak at the time. The effective

96

reproductive number (Re) is a key epidemiological parameter reflecting the potential of an

97

infection to cause an epidemic in a partially immune population; an epidemic is possible when

98

Re>1. The estimated Re was 1.5 (95% CI: 0.7, 2.9) in Oct 2018 and dropped to round 1 (95% CI:

99

0.7, 1.5) in Dec 2018 (Fig. 4B).

100
101

The outbreak, however, took off again in early 2019 (Fig. 1). The estimated Re increased

102

and remained above 1 in the first three months of 2019 (Fig. 4B). In a perfectly mixed model, Re

103

is computed as the product of the basic reproductive number R0 and population susceptibility. In

104

particular, the basic reproductive number R0 measures the transmissibility of an infection in a

105

fully susceptible population; for measles, while often reported in the range of 12-18, R0 could

106

vary from 1.4 to 770 (6). In this study, we estimated that R0 was approximately 7 during the

107

entire outbreak (Fig. 4A). Population susceptibility, the other factor for Re, were to increase in a

108

close population (i.e., without migration), could only do so slowly as infants lose maternal

109

immunity. Thus, these two factors alone could not explain the sudden large increase in Re (Fig.

110

4B). In this study, we utilized an age-structured model that enables more detailed analysis of the

111

transmission dynamics. Indeed, our model-filter system detected an increase in contact rate

112

among 1-4 year-olds during Jan-March 2019 (Fig. 4D); this increased contact rate along with the

113

high susceptibility among 1-4 year-olds appeared to raise Re above unity (Eqn 5 in Methods) and

114

contribute to the re-surge of measles in early 2019. This finding was also consistent with reports

115

of parents hosting "measles parties" to exposure unvaccinated children at the time (7). In

116

contrast, estimated contact rates were relatively stable for other age groups (e.g., Fig. 4 E and F

117

for 5-17 and 18-49 year-olds, respectively). As a result, infections increased quickly among 1-4

118

year-olds (Figures 1 and 4D), reaching a peak of around 80 cases in March. Meanwhile,

119

infections also increased in other age groups including 5-17 and 18+ year-olds despite their low

120

overall susceptibilities, due to interactions between age-groups (Fig. S2) and the high contact

121

rates in these groups (Fig. 4 E and F).

122
123

The outbreak began to decline in Apr 2019, following more stringent public health

124

interventions (3, 4). In particular, the model estimated that, thanks to extensive vaccination

125

campaigns, susceptibility was reduced to 22.8% (95% CI: 19.3, 26.0%) in <1 year-olds, 4.3%

126

(95% CI: 0.5, 8.9%) in 1-4 year-olds, and 2.4% (95% CI: 0.4, 4.4%) in 5-17 year-olds at the end

127

of May. Consequently, the effective reproductive number Re dropped below 1 from April

128

onwards.

129
130

Who acquired infection from whom?

131

Table 1 shows the estimated proportions of infections caused by each of the five age groups

132

based on the estimated Who-Acquires-Infection-From-Whom (WAIFW) contact matrix (Eqn 2

133

in Methods). Children aged 1-4 years not only had the largest number of infections (42.8%), but

134

also appeared to cause the largest number of infections in other age groups. Tallied over the

135

entire study period (Oct 2018-July 2019), an estimated 51.6% (95% CI: 39.3, 63.1%) of the total

136

cases were infected by 1-4 year-olds, compared to 25.2% (95% CI: 15.8, 35.5%) by 5-17 year-

137

olds, 17.7% (95% CI: 10.4, 26.5%) by 18-49 year-olds, 4.5% (95% CI: 3.0, 6.4%) by <1 year-

138

olds, and 1.0% (95% CI: 0.4, 1.8%) by 50+ year-olds. In particular, this age group caused

139

around half of the infections in infants (44.6% or 45 cases) as well as the largest proportions of

140

inter-group transmission to other age-groups (ranging from 12.9% to 5-17 year-olds to 40.1% to

141

50+ year-olds; Table 1).

142
143

Estimated impact of vaccination campaigns

144

Figure 5 shows the estimated outbreak outcomes had there be no vaccination campaigns.

145

Without the vaccination campaigns, the model estimated that the outbreak could continue to the

146

end of 2019 and infect a total of 6196 (95% CI: 5, 8478) people by then or 6078 (95% CI: 5,

147

8433) during the observed outbreak period (i.e. Oct 2018 – July 2019), compared to 642 cases

148

reported as of Aug 6, 2019. In addition, these infections would largely occur in infants under 1

149

and young children aged 1-4 years. During the observed outbreak period, there would be 1015

150

(95%: 0, 1430) infections in infants and 3052 (95% CI: 2, 4096) infections in 1-4 year-olds,

151

more than 10 times of the reported numbers in these two age groups (i.e. 100 and 275,

152

respectively, as of Aug 6, 2019; Table 2). Children aged 5-17 years would have the third largest

153

number of infections, with 1107 (95% CI: 1, 1692) cases, 8 times of the reported number (i.e.

154

138 as of Aug 6, 2019).

155
156

Measles can cause severe diseases. According to data by Apr 24, 2019, among 390

157

individuals with measles, 29 were hospitalized, of which six needed intensive care (8). Assuming

158

the same ratios among all cases, without the vaccination campaigns, during the observed

159

outbreak period there would be 452 (95% CI: 0, 628) hospitalizations, including 94 (95% CI: 0,

160

130) needing intensive care, and the majority would be in young children under 4 (Table 2).

Discussion

163

Using a model-filter inference system, we have reconstructed in detail the transmission dynamics

164

of the measles outbreak in an Orthodox Jewish community in NYC during Oct 2018 – July 2019.

165

We have estimated the population characteristics (e.g. age-specific susceptibilities) and

166

epidemiological parameters (e.g. reproductive numbers) as well as subtle changes in key

167

parameters (e.g. contact rates) that are critical to the transmission of measles. Using model

168

simulation and the posterior estimates from the model-inference system, we are also able to

169

estimate the impact of vaccination campaigns implemented during the outbreak, including

170

numbers of infections and hospitalizations averted, for each age group. These latter findings echo

171

those from previous studies (9-11) and again highlight the severity of measles disease, should

172

there be no effective infection and transmission controls (in particular, vaccination).

173
174

Our analyses estimate that around a quarter of young children aged 1-4 in the affected

175

community were susceptible at the onset of the outbreak, likely due to delayed vaccination.

176

Indeed, 94% (101/108) of the early infections in children were unvaccinated (12). In contrast,

177

vaccination rate remained high in older children 5-17 years, with an estimated 94% immune to

178

measles. This difference may be due to better compliance with vaccination regulation at school

179

entry, or a result of vaccination campaigns in response to previous outbreaks (e.g., a large

180

outbreak occurred in the same community in 2013 (13)). Nevertheless, the large number of

181

unvaccinated children under 4 was sufficient to cause many infections in late 2018,

182

predominantly in the same age group (Fig. 1 and references (2, 12, 14)). This observation

183

highlights the importance of vaccination compliance with both MMR vaccine doses, especially

184

given the long lag between the two vaccine doses. In addition, recommending the second MMR

185

dose earlier than the currently scheduled age 4-6 years could allow pro-vaccine parents to fully

186

vaccinate their children sooner and reduce the number of susceptible children overall.

187
188

Our study also reveals intricate interplays of population dynamics and measles

189

transmission. While the high susceptibility in children under 4 was likely responsible for the

190

early spread of measles, our estimates suggest that the second and more severe part of the

191

outbreak in 2019 was likely due to increased infectious contact among this age group, likely

192

facilitated by parents hosting "measles parties" that intentionally bring unvaccinated children

193

together and expose them to those sick with measles (7). As shown in Fig. 4, the increase in

194

infectious contact interacting with the high susceptibility in 1-4 year-olds was able to raise the

195

effective reproductive number Re to above unity—the threshold for an epidemic to occur—and

196

aggravate the outbreak in 2019, despite earlier public health efforts that had reduced Re to below

197

1 in late 2018. Similar disease-related gatherings have been noted in previous measles outbreaks

198

(15) as well as other disease outbreaks (16). These activities create further challenges for the

199

control of measles spread and stress the need for enhanced public health education.

200
201

In addition, the intensified measles outbreak not only affected children with delayed

202

vaccination, but also a large number of infants under 1, who were too young to receive their first

203

dose of MMR vaccine in the US. At least 100 infants under 1 were infected with measles during

204

the 10-month outbreak period, despite extensive infection and transmission control efforts

205

including vaccinating infants 6 months or older and post-exposure prophylaxis with immune

206

globulin given to those under 6 months (2, 14). This was largely a result of the high

207

susceptibility in infants. Our model-inference system estimates that about half of infants were

208

susceptible by age 1 and that nearly half of the 100 infant cases were infected by 1-4 year-olds

209

(Table 1). In addition, our simulations suggest that, without the vaccination campaigns, the

210

number of infections in infants would be over 10 times higher than observed (Table 2). These

211

findings demonstrate the rippling effects of vaccine hesitancy beyond the risk posted to age-

212

eligible children with delayed vaccination. These findings also suggest that administration of the

213

first dose of routine MMR vaccine earlier than the current 1 year age-limit in the US may be

214

necessary to protect infants should high level of vaccine hesitancy persist. Of note, the World

215

Health Organization (WHO) recommends administering the first dose of measles vaccine at 9-12

216

months of age for routine vaccination programs and as early as 6 months for settings such as

217

during an outbreak (17).

218
219

Our model simulations, consistent with many previous studies (11, 15, 18), demonstrate

220

the significant public health impact of vaccination in controlling measles outbreaks. Without the

221

implemented vaccination campaigns, the severity of the measles outbreak—including number of

222

infections, hospitalizations, and severe infections needing intensive care—would be about 10

223

times worse than observed (Table 2). These estimates, however, did not include the long-term

224

health impacts on affected individuals, particularly young children (10, 19, 20), nor the

225

enormous economic burdens (13, 21, 22).

226
227

We note several limitations of our study. First, we did not explicitly model the impact

228

of public health interventions other than the vaccination campaigns, due to a lack of data. During

229

the outbreak, such efforts included prescreening patients prior to presence for treatment, post-

10

230

exposure prophylaxis, and closing schools out of vaccination compliance (2, 12, 14, 23, 24). Of

231

note, however, here the estimated basic reproductive number R0 was around 7, lower than the 12-

232

18 range based on epidemics in the pre-vaccine era (25); and the estimated infectious period was

233

around 4 days (Fig. 4C), at the lower end of the commonly used range of 4-6 days (26). The

234

lower R0 and shorter infectious period could be a result of the aforementioned public health

235

interventions. Second, there were uncertainties in the accuracy of case reporting. Because the

236

incidence data used here were published on Aug 6, 2016, a later revision of case reports, we used

237

a relatively high but broad prior range for the reporting rate (i.e. 80-100%). In addition, our

238

model-inference system explicitly accounted for observational errors (Eqn 7a and 7b). Third,

239

due to a lack of contact data and for simplicity, we set all terms related to group-1 (i.e. <1 year-

240

olds) in the WAIFW matrix to the same as the contact rate within the group (Eqn 2). The model

241

formulation may have led to under-estimation of the proportions of infection in <1 year-olds

242

attributable to the same age group and/or 1-4 year-olds, given the likely more frequent contact

243

within the same age group and with similar ages (i.e. 1-4 years) due to more shared settings such

244

as daycares and pediatric hospitals. Lastly, there were uncertainties regarding the settings of

245

vaccination campaigns. Nevertheless, sensitivity analysis showed that our main estimates were

246

robust to a wide range of assumptions (Table S2).

247
248

In summary, using a comprehensive model-inference system, we have reconstructed

249

transmission dynamics of the recent measles outbreak in NYC in great detail. Our estimates

250

highlight the importance of vaccination in protecting children as well as public health education

251

to reduce activities that unnecessarily expose children to risk of measles infection. Further, in

light of the persistent vaccine hesitancy, revising current vaccination recommendations may

253

allow pro-vaccine parents to vaccinate and protect their children more effectively.

Materials and Methods

256

The measles outbreak occurred predominantly among members of the Orthodox Jewish

257

community in Williamsburg and Borough Park, two neighborhoods in located in Brooklyn,

258

NYC. As such, we focused on modeling the outbreak in this subpopulation. Estimated based on

259

the Jewish Community Study of New York (27), approximately N=165,970 Orthodox Jews live

260

in these two NYC neighborhoods, of which 4552 (2.7%), 18,208 (11%), 59,176 (35.7%), 60,445

261

(36.4%), and 23,589 (14.2%) are <1, 1-4, 5-17, 18-49, and 50+ years, respectively.

263

Estimating monthly incidence by age group

264

Monthly measles incidence aggregated over all ages from Sep 2018 to Aug 2019 and the age

265

distribution of case-patients over the entire outbreak were published on the NYC DOHMH

266

website (3). Of note, 1 case was reported in Sep 2018 (i.e., the initial case) and none were

267

reported in Aug 2019 at the time of this writing. In addition, the numbers of reported cases were

268

subsequently revised by the DOHMH (often adjusted upwards, presumably from retrospective

269

case identification) and, as such, varied over time. To estimate the monthly incidence for each

270

age group, we used the age distribution of cases reported in earlier health reports/alerts (5) to

271

apportion the total incidence for each month. For months without age information, we used

272

estimates either from the preceding month or the following month back-calculated from the

273

overall age distribution.

Transmission model

276

The transmission model used here was similar to described in our previous study (28). As

277

illustrated in Fig. S1, the model represents the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR)

278

disease dynamics with five age groups (i.e. <1, 1-4, 5-17, 18-49, and 50+ years) to account for

279

population differences by age group (e.g., susceptibility and contact rate), routine two-dose

280

vaccination at ages 1 and 5, and immunization during the vaccination campaigns per Eqn 1:

group; M is the number of infants with maternal immunity, which decays exponentially with a

286

mean duration of 180 days; t is time in days. Vi(t) is the number of people in group-i immunized

by the vaccination campaigns on day-t (described in detail in the next section). The exponents

m1 and m2 describe the level of inhomogeneous mixing (29, 30); and m1=m2=1 represents

To model the different contact rates within and between age groups, we used 7

where β1 to β5 represent within-group contact for the five age groups and β6 and β7 represent

mixing between siblings and child-parent, respectively. For simplicity, we set all interactions

296

with group 1 (i.e. <1 year) or group 5 (50+ years) to β1, the lowest contact rate. For group-3 (5-

297

17 years), to capture the varying contact rate following school schedules, we adjusted *H for each

302
303

The basic reproductive number R0, defined as the average number of secondary infections

304

caused by a primary case-patient in a naïve population, reflects the transmissibility of an

305

infection. In an age-structured model, R0 is computed as:

306

C\ = eigenabc (dDB)

(Eqn 4)

307

where eigenmax(·) denotes the function giving the largest eigenvalue of a matrix, and n is a

308

diagonal matrix with elements ni=Ni/∑Ni (i=1, …, 5 here), i.e. the fraction of population in

309

group-i. Based on this relationship between R0 and the β matrix, we reparametrized the model to

310

include R0 as a model parameter by setting β1 to 1 and estimating the relative magnitude of β2–β6,

311

all scaled to R0. In the current mass vaccination era, most people are immune via vaccination. To

312

reflect the potential of an infection to cause an epidemic in a partially susceptible population, the

313

effective reproductive number, Re, accounts for population susceptibility and is computed as:

To model the demographic processes, k is the birth rate (2.7 per 1000 person-year here

319

(27)); v is the immunity level in mothers, approximated by the susceptibility of the child-bearing

320

age-group (i.e., 18-49 year-olds); N is total population size; and 1i=1 is an indicator function, with

321

value 1 for group-1 (<1 year-olds) and 0 for all other groups. Thus, the term k(1-v) 1i=1 (1st line in

322

Eqn 1) is the number of susceptible newborns and kvN (last line in Eqn 1) is the number of

323

newborns with maternal immunity. The term li is the rate of aging for group-i (i.e. the inverse of

324

the sojourn time in each age group) with l0 set to 0 and l5 set to the death rate. The term vi (for

325

i=1 and 2) is the vaccination rate for the two doses of vaccine (i.e., vi=0 for i=0, 3, and 4). In this

326

study, we set v1 (1st dose) to 0.9 times the immunity level of group-2 (i.e., assuming a 90%

327

vaccine efficacy) and v2 (2nd dose) to 0.7 for days before May 2019; for days afterwards, we used

328

0.8 for v1 and 0.9 for v2, corresponding to a 1-(1-0.8)(1-0.9)=98% overall vaccination rate.

Based on NYC health reports/alerts (2, 12, 14), we seeded the model, via the parameter

332

and Oct 30, 2018, respectively—and 1 case each in group-3 (5-17 year-olds) and group-4 (18-49

year-olds), both during the winter recess (from 12/24/18 to 1/1/19).

336

To contain the outbreak, the NYC DOHMH conducted extensive vaccination campaigns and

337

administered 31,790 doses of MMR vaccine to children under 19 years in Williamsburg and

338

Borough Park by July 2019 (3). However, information on the age and immune status of

339

vaccinees was not reported. In this study, per the health reports/alters (3, 12), we assumed there

340

were two phases of vaccination campaign: 1) Oct 2018 – Feb 2019, during which 7000 children,

341

90% Orthodox Jewish (15% were <1 year, 65% 1-4 years, and 20% 5-17 years) were vaccinated;

342

and 2) Mar – July 2019, during which 24,790 children, 60% Orthodox Jewish (10%, 40%, and

343

50%, respectively, were <1, 1-4, and 5-17 years) were vaccinated. For reference, Orthodox Jews

344

made up for approximately 30% of the total population in the two affected neighborhoods.

345
346

For <1 year-olds, immunization could fail due to residual maternal immunity; thus, we

347

assumed a 85% immunization success rate for group-1. For those above 1 year, some vaccinees

348

might have received 1 or 2 doses of vaccine and higher the population susceptibility, the less

349

likely a vaccinee had been immune before the additional vaccine dose. As such, we assumed the

350

immunization success rate was twice the group-specific susceptibility for 1-4 year-olds and three

351

times that for 5-17 year-olds or at a minimum of 25% and a maximum of 75%. We further

352

assumed a 10-day delay in vaccine effect and computed the daily number of individuals

353

vaccinated per a gamma distribution (mean=30 days and standard deviation=21 days for Phase-1

354

and mean=56 and standard deviation=15 days for Phase-2 such that it peaked ~1 week after Apr

355

9, 2019 when the city implemented a vaccination mandate). The estimated numbers matched

356

with the reports (e.g., 1740 doses by our model vs ~1600 doses given to children under 5 as

357

reported (32) and 1142 doses by our model vs ~1000 doses given in March 2019 as reported (7,

358

33)). These daily numbers were then included in the transmission model [i.e. Vi(t) in Eqn 1].

359

Sensitivity to model assumptions were tested as described below.

360
361

Estimation of model state variables and parameters

362

To estimate the model state variables (i.e., Si, Ei, Ii, Ri, and M) and parameters (β2 to β7, R0, b1, D,

363

Z, m1, and m2), we fitted the model to the reported monthly overall incidence and the estimated

364

monthly age-grouped incidence using a particle filter (34). Briefly, we first initialized a suite of

365

model realizations (termed "particles", N=10,000 here) using Latin Hypercube sampling (35)

366

from the prior distribution of state variables and parameters (Table S1). The particle filter then

367

sequentially incorporated the monthly incidence to the model via repeated prediction-update

368

cycles. In each cycle (i.e., each month here), the particles were stochastically integrated forward

369

in time for a month per the model (i.e., Eqn 1; this generates the prediction). To update the model

370

state including all model variables and parameters, at the end of each month, the model-

371

estimated incidence was aggregated for the month, adjusted by the reporting rate for that month

372

(estimated simultaneously by the filter), and used to compute the likelihood of each particle

373

(described below). The posterior of model state was then computed using Bayes' rule (34, 36)

374

and the particles resampled and updated—those with high posterior probabilities were retained

375

and those with very low posterior probabilities discarded.

376
377

To allow for a wider observational variance than, e.g., the Poisson process, we

378

heuristically modeled the observations using a multivariate Gaussian distribution (i.e. the

379

likelihood function):

381

where Ym is the vector of monthly incidence reported for month-m, including the monthly

382

incidence for individual age-groups (i.e., <1, 1-4, 5-17 and 18+ years; note that 18-49 and 50+

383

year-olds were combined due to a lack of data for these two groups separately) and all ages

384

combined. Correspondingly, Cm is the vector of monthly incidence estimated by the model; and r

385

is the reporting rate and, for simplicity, assumed the same for all ages. n is the covariance

386

matrix, with the off-diagonal terms set to 0. To account for uncertainties in the estimated age-

387

grouped incidence, the variance (Σ## , p = 1, … , 4) for each of the 4 aforementioned age-groups

388

was heuristically computed as:

389

Σ##,' = 100 +

0
( Pu0
sP /H)
P

H

(Eqn 7a)

390
391

That is, the observational variance is proportional to the average incidence in the preceding two

392

months (if available) and the current month, plus a baseline constant. For the overall incidence

393

with detailed data, a smaller variance was used:

394

Σ##,' = 100 +

(Eqn 7b)

395
396

As there were great uncertainties in the susceptibilities of the younger age groups, we

397

tested prior ranges from 10-40% for 1-4 year-olds, 5-20% for 5-17 year-olds, and 5-15% for 18-

398

49 year-olds. For the basic reproductive number R0, we tested prior values ranging from 5 to 12

399

(note these values were lower than the oft-reported 12-18 range (6, 25)). To optimize the model-

400

filter system, we parsed these wide ranges into smaller segments and tested all combinations by

401

permutation (5040 in total; see specific prior ranges in Table S1). To account for model

402

stochasticity, we ran the model-filter system 5 times for each prior combination and 10 times for

403

the final prior select. We then selected the optimal priors based on the model-goodness-of-fit to

404

the data (minimal root-mean-square-error and maximal correlation and likelihood) over the

405

period of Oct 2018 – July 2019 as well as accuracy of the one-step-ahead predictions (recall that

406

the particle filtering process comprises sequential prediction-update cycles) for the period of Oct

407

2018 – March 2019 (i.e. before the emergency vaccination mandate). We pooled all 10 final runs

408

(10,000 particles each run and 100,000 model realizations in total) to compute the posterior

409

estimates (e.g., mean and 95% CI).

410
411

Sensitivity analysis on vaccination campaigns settings

412

To test the sensitivity of model results to assumptions on vaccination campaign settings, we

413

tested the model-filter system using the following alternative scenarios:

414
415
416

1) For the 2nd phase (Mar-July 2019), 90% (vs. 60% in the baseline scenario) of the
vaccine doses were given to members of the Orthodox Jewish community;
2) For the 2nd phase, the age distribution of vaccinees was the same as the 1st phase (i.e.

417

15%, 65%, and 20%, respectively, for <1, 1-4, and 5-17 year-olds vs. 10%, 40%, and 50% for

418

the three groups in the baseline scenario);

419

3) For the 2nd phase, 90% of the vaccine doses were given to Orthodox Jewish and the

420

age distribution of vaccinees was the same as the 1st phase (i.e. 15%, 65%, and 20% for <1, 1-4,

421

and 5-17 year-olds, respectively).

422
423

Because population susceptibility would be affected by the number of individuals

424

immunized by the vaccination campaigns, we tested susceptibility ranges 10-40% for 1-4 year-

425

olds, 5-20% for 5-17 year-olds, and 5-15% for 18-49 year-olds, divided in to small segments as

426

for the baseline scenario (140 different combinations for each alternative scenario; Table S1).

427

For simplicity, we used the same optimal prior ranges for the parameters under the baseline

428

scenario in this sensitivity analysis.

429
430

Evaluating the impact of vaccination campaigns

431

To estimate the impact of vaccination campaigns, we generated model-simulated

432

counterfactuals—i.e., outbreak outcomes should there be no vaccination campaigns

433

implemented—using the posterior mean estimates of group-specific initial population

434

susceptibilities and model parameters for each month. We ran the model (10,000 realizations)

435

stochastically up to the end of 2019 to test how long the outbreak could last without intervention;

436

for months after Aug 2019, parameters estimated at the end of July 2019 were used.

Figure Captions:
Fig. 1. Monthly incidence for all ages and by age group. The solid line (y-axis on the right)
shows monthly incidence for all ages, reported as of Aug 6, 2019. For comparison, bars (y-axis
on the left) show monthly incidence for <1 (blue), 1-4 (orange), 5-17 (grey) and 18+ (yellow)
year-olds, respectively, estimated based on health reports.
Fig. 2. Model fit. Box plots show estimates of monthly incidence for all ages (A), percentage of
cases reported in each age group (B), and monthly incidence for <1 year-olds (C), 1-4 year-olds
(D), 5-17 year-olds (E), and 18+ year-olds (F). Results are pooled over all 10 model-filter runs
(each with 10,000 and in total 100,000 model realizations). Horizontal thick lines show the
median of model estimates; box edges show the 25th and 75th percentiles; whiskers show the 2.5th
and 97.5th percentiles; and dots show outliers. Stars (*) in A and B show monthly incidence for
all ages and the age distribution, reported as of Aug 6, 2019; crosses (x) in C-F show agegrouped monthly incidence estimated from health reports.
Fig. 3. Estimated changes in population susceptibility. Red lines and surrounding areas (y-axis
on the left) show the mean and 95% credible intervals of estimates pooled over all 10 modelfilter runs (100,000 model realizations in total) for <1 year-olds (A), 1-4 year-olds (B), 5-17
year-olds (C) and 18+ year-olds (D), respectively, at the end of each month from Sep 2018 to
July 2019. The initial susceptibilities, estimated at the end of Sep 2018, were computed by
adding the total numbers of individuals immunized by the vaccination campaigns in Oct 2018 to
the posterior estimates at the end of Oct 2018. For comparison, the grey bars (y-axis on the
right) show estimated numbers of individuals immunized during the vaccination campaigns; note
that the vaccination campaigns targeted individuals under 19 years and thus is not shown for 18+
year-olds.
Fig. 4. Estimates of key model parameters: (A) the basic reproductive number, (B) the effective
reproductive number, (C) infectious period, (D) relative contact rate among 1-4 year-olds, (E)
relative contact rate among 5-17 year-olds, and (F) relative contact rate among 18-49 year-olds.
Red lines and surrounding areas (y-axis on the left) show the mean and 95% credible intervals of
estimates pooled over all 10 model-filter runs (100,000 model realizations in total) made at the
end of each month from Oct 2018 to July 2019. For comparison, the grey bars (y-axis on the
left) show monthly incidence for all ages (A-C) or the related age groups (D-F).
Fig. 5. Estimated impact of vaccination campaigns. Box plots show simulated estimates of
monthly incidence for all ages (A), percentage of cases reported in each age group (B), and
monthly incidence for <1 year-olds (C), 1-4 year-olds (D), 5-17 year-olds (E), and 18+ year-olds
(F), should there be no vaccination campaigns. Results are pooled over 10,000 model
simulations. Horizontal thick lines show the median of model estimates; box edges show the 25th
and 75th percentiles; whiskers show the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles; and dots show outliers. For
comparison, stars (*) in A and B show monthly incidence for all ages and the age distribution,
reported as of Aug 6, 2019; crosses (x) in C-F show age-grouped monthly incidence estimated

Table S2. Comparison of model estimates on initial susceptibility and model performance under
different assumptions on vaccination campaigns. The baseline setting is as reported in the main
text and alternative settings 1 to 3 are as described in the section "Sensitivity analysis on
vaccination campaigns settings." The results are summarized by pooling all 10 model-filter runs
(10,000 particles each run and 100,000 model realizations in total). The numbers are the mean
and, for the susceptibilities, 95% credible intervals in the parentheses. The initial susceptibilities,
estimated at the end of Sep 2018, were computed by adding the total numbers of individuals
immunized by the vaccination campaigns in Oct 2018 to the posterior estimates at the end of Oct
2018.

Fig. S1. Schematic of the measles transmission model. Measles transmission model follows the
susceptible (S), exposed (E) and latently infected, infectious (I), and recovered (R) and/or
immunized SEIR dynamics and includes 5 age-groups as indicated by the subscripts (i.e., <1, 14, 5-17, 18-49, and 50+ year-olds, respectively) and a group (M) for infants with maternal
immunity. Black solid arrows show the disease-related processes; grey solid arrows show the
demographic processes including birth (horizontal), aging (vertical), and death (tilted). Black
dashed arrows show processes related to the routine 2-dose measles vaccination where
susceptible individuals are vaccinated at ages 1 and 5 and move to the respective immune
groups. Red dotted arrows show processes related to vaccination of susceptible individuals under
18 during the vaccination campaigns.

Fig. S2. Estimates of model parameters not listed in Fig. 4: (A) amplitude of school term-time
forcing, (B) latent period, (C) reporting rate, (D) relative contact rate among 50+ year-olds, (E)
relative contact rate between 1-4 and 5-17 year-olds (i.e. sibling interactions), and (F) relative
contact rate between 18-49 and 1-4 or 5-17 year-olds (i.e. parent-child interactions). Red lines
and surrounding areas (y-axis on the left) show the mean and 95% credible intervals of estimates
pooled over all 10 model-filter runs (100,000 model realizations in total) made at the end of each
month from Oct 2018 to July 2019. For comparison, the grey bars (y-axis on the left) show
monthly incidence for all ages. Note that m1 and m2 are not shown as both optimal priors are the
value 1 (Table S1).
