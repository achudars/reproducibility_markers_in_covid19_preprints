Abstract

21

Introduction: Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) is a distressing and persistent sense of tiredness

22

or exhaustion that interferes with usual functioning. Chronic CRF continues for months after

23

curative cancer treatment is complete. Post-exertional malaise (PEM) is a worsening of

24

symptoms after physical or mental activity, with limited investigations in people with chronic

25

CRF. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe self-reported incidences of PEM

26

in people with chronic CRF.

27

Methods: Participants (n=18) were eligible if they scored ≤34 on the Functional Assessment

28

of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue scale and had a cancer-related onset of fatigue. Participants

29

completed a brief questionnaire to assess PEM over a 6-month time-frame (the DePaul

30

Symptom Questionnaire – Post-Exertional Malaise; DSQ-PEM). In addition, a maximal

31

exercise test was used to investigate self-reported symptom exacerbation (via an open-ended

32

questionnaire) after strenuous physical exertion.

33

Results: On the DSQ-PEM, three participants met objective scoring criteria, which included

34

experiencing moderate to very severe symptoms at least half of the time, worsening of fatigue

35

after minimal effort, plus a recovery duration of >24 h. Content analysis of responses to open-

36

ended questionnaires identified five people who experienced a delayed recovery and symptoms

37

of PEM after the exercise test.

38

Discussion: While only a minority (up to 29% in this sample) may experience PEM, exercise

39

specialists and health care professionals working with people with chronic CRF must be aware

40

that PEM may be an issue. Symptom exacerbation after exercise should be monitored, and

41

exercise should be tailored and adapted to limit the potential for harm.

Introduction

44

Cancer-related fatigue (CRF) has been defined as a distressing, persistent sense of physical,

45

emotional, and/or cognitive tiredness or exhaustion that is not proportional to recent activity

46

and interferes with usual functioning [1]. The majority of people with cancer will experience

47

CRF during active treatment, but this will resolve in the weeks after treatment. However, 20-

48

30% of people will continue to experience CRF for months or years following treatment [2–4],

49

Variations in the estimates of prevalence may reflect variability in the measurement of CRF

50

[2–4]. Previous research has shown that people who have severe CRF at least 2 months after

51

cancer treatment often do not recover and remain fatigued [3]. CRF that continues for months

52

or years has been called chronic CRF [4] or post-cancer fatigue [5]. Although there is no strict

53

consensus on when CRF can be described as chronic, we and other research groups [5,6] define

54

chronic CRF/post-cancer fatigue as clinically-relevant CRF that continues for ≥3 months after

55

the completion of cancer treatment.

56
57

CRF is assessed as a patient-reported outcome, and there are psychometric tools used for both

58

routine screening [7], and the assessment of CRF severity [8]. Evidence-based guidelines for

59

the screening, assessment and treatment of CRF have been developed, including pan-Canadian

60

practice guidelines for clinical use [7,9]. In addition, there are consensus-developed diagnostic

61

criteria for CRF, as proposed for the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and

62

Related Health Problems, 10th revision (ICD-10) in 1998 [10]. The proposed ICD-10 criteria

63

specify that six or more symptoms must have been present every day or nearly every day during

64

the same two-week period over the past month, and at least one symptom must be “significant

65

fatigue.” Previous qualitative data have been interpreted as consistent with various descriptors

66

in the ICD-10 case definition of CRF, including an excessive fatigue state, protracted in course,

67

in relation to relatively limited physical activity [11]. Alongside items such as “perceived need

68

to struggle to overcome inactivity” and “difficulty completing daily tasks attributed to feeling

69

fatigued”, “post-exertional malaise (PEM) lasting several hours” is also included in the ICD-

70

10 criteria [10]. However, PEM has not been defined in the context of CRF, and is only vaguely

71

addressed in the accompanying diagnostic interview guide, where the related question is: “Did

72

you find yourself feeling sick or unwell for several hours after you had done something that

73

took some effort?” [10].

74
75

PEM is a cardinal symptom of a separate and serious long-term illness called myalgic

76

encephalitis and/or chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) [12]. In ME/CFS, PEM is described

77

by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as a worsening of symptoms after physical

78

or mental activity that would not have caused a problem before illness [12]. PEM in ME/CFS

79

has also been described as a constellation of extensively disabling signs and symptoms in

80

response to exertion [13]. Historically, there has been difficulty in defining and measuring PEM

81

(see [14] for more information), but for the purposes of this study, we will use PEM to denote

82

concepts related to post-exertional symptom exacerbation [14].

83
84

The chronic nature of CRF in some cancer survivors has led to a comparison with ME/CFS

85

[15]. Following a reanalysis of an influential study [16], and concerns among clinicians that

86

exercise exacerbates or causes PEM, graded exercise (progressive aerobic activity) is no longer

87

a recommended therapy in ME/CFS [13]. However, in people living with and beyond cancer,

88

exercise (including moderate-vigorous exercise) is considered a safe and effective intervention

89

to counteract the adverse physical and psychological effects of cancer and its treatment [17,18],

90

including CRF (e.g. [19]). Considering a failure to adequately report adverse reactions to

91

exercise in previous studies of ME/CFS [20], and the lack of data on PEM in people with

92

chronic CRF, caution may be warranted. PEM is inadequately documented in the literature on

93

chronic CRF and requires further investigation considering the potential implications for

94

exercise prescription. The purpose of this study was to identify and describe self-reported

95

incidences of PEM in a group of people with chronic CRF. Despite the inclusion of “PEM

96

lasting several hours” in the proposed ICD-10 criteria for CRF [6], to our knowledge, this is

97

the first attempt to measure PEM in people with chronic CRF. Based on our experience with

98

an ongoing exercise trial for chronic CRF [21], we hypothesized that a minority of people with

99

chronic CRF would experience PEM.

the most recent (i.e. last) surgery, chemotherapy treatment, radiation treatment or stem cell

112

transplant (as relevant) and the date of the lab visit. Furthermore, participants were eligible if

113

they scored ≤34 [22] on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale

114

(FACIT-F) [23]. The FACIT-F is widely recommended for the assessment of CRF severity [8],

115

has a cut-off point (≤34) that correctly identifies over 90% of ‘ICD-10 positive’ cases, and has

116

been recommended for the diagnosis of CRF [22]. Based on these eligibility criteria, all

117

participants in the larger study were considered to have chronic CRF. Participants were

118

excluded if they had a contraindication to experimental procedures and/or exercise. Additional

119

inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reported previously [21]. Written informed consent

120

for all study procedures was obtained. This study was approved by the Health Research Ethics

121

Board of Alberta Cancer Committee (HREBA.CC-16-10-10) and was performed according to

122

the Declaration of Helsinki.

124

Laboratory Visit

125

Full details of the wider project have been reported elsewhere [21]. The data for this sub-study

126

were collected during and after an initial visit to the laboratory, previously described as Lab

127

Visit #1 [21]. The lab visit commenced between 8:00 – 9:30 am and lasted 2 – 3 h. Participants

128

were advised to consume breakfast 1.5 h prior to arrival at the laboratory. Participants were

129

instructed to arrive at the laboratory hydrated and to refrain from alcohol, caffeine and

130

strenuous activity for the preceding 24 h. Participants completed a Physical Activity Readiness

131

Questionnaire for Everyone (PAR-Q+) and were also screened for arrhythmia and

132

hypertension,

133

measurements, respectively. Continuation with the study was conditional on the screening

134

process, and physician approval was sought at this stage where required. Otherwise,

135

participants were cleared for participation by a Certified Exercise Physiologist (Canadian

136

Society for Exercise Physiology). Following the measurement of stature (cm) and body mass

137

(kg), a maximal exercise test was conducted on a custom-built recumbent ergometer, whch

138

uses an electromagnetically-braked Velotron system (RacerMate Inc, Seattle, WA). Seat

139

position was adjusted for each participant, and self-selected cadence was determined during

140

the first minute of cycling. Participants were instrumented for the measurement of heart rate

141

and breath-by-breath pulmonary gas exchange and ventilation (Quark CPET, COSMED,

142

Rome, Italy). The starting power output (25-50 W) and increment (8-20 W) was adjusted on

143

an individual basis as that which was estimated to result in a test of 8-12 min duration. The

144

power was increased at 1-min intervals until volitional exhaustion. Rating of perceived exertion

145

(RPE) (Borg’s RPE scale [24], administered according to published instructions [25]) and

146

dyspnea (Borg CR-10 scale [26]) was recorded every minute. For all cycling tests, verbal

147

encouragement was provided by the same experimenters every 20-60 s [27]. A fingertip blood

148

sample was collected at exercise cessation for the analysis of blood lactate (Lactate Scout+,

149

EFK Diagnostics, Cardiff, UK), and participants completed a supervised cool down. Data

150

collected during the test and used for the main study (e.g. peak oxygen uptake, heart rate, RPE

151

and blood lactate) is reported for the purpose of characterizing the test and describing the sub-

152

study participants.

153
154

Measurement of Post-Exertional Malaise

155

Before the exercise test, participants completed a brief questionnaire to assess PEM over a 6-

156

month time-frame (the DePaul Symptom Questionnaire – Post-Exertional Malaise; DSQ-PEM)

157

[28,29]. The first five items (Table 2) were recommended by the National Institutes of

158

Health/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Common Data Elements (CDE) PEM

159

working group [30] and five supplementary items (including symptom duration, see Table 2)

160

were designed to operationalize the CDE recommendations [23] further. In the pre-registration

161

for this study (https://osf.io/nygq5/), we planned to use the Edmonton Symptom Assessment

162

System (ESAS-r) [31,32] as a quantitative assessment of symptom exacerbation after the

163

exercise test. However, we modified the instruction “Please circle the number that best

164

describes how you feel NOW” to “Please circle the number that best describes your average

165

symptom over the past 24 hours”. This was confusing for participants who were using the

166

ESAS-r (with the momentary instruction) as part of the wider project. Therefore, we removed

167

this outcome. To gain a comprehensive understanding of the participant experience, an open-

168

ended questionnaire was provided (hard copy or via email, participant preference), and

169

participants were instructed to complete this 96 h after the exercise test. This accounted for the

170

potential for prolonged adverse responses as reported in people with ME/CFS [33], while also

171

limiting the requirement for recall. The open-ended questionnaire was designed based on a

172

review of the literature on PEM in ME/CFS (e.g. [11,14,33,34]) and is available online

173

(https://osf.io/nygq5/).

174
175

Data Analysis

176

For the DSQ-PEM, items 1-5 were scored according to Cotler et al. [28], i.e., a frequency score

177

of ≥2 (i.e., “about half the time” or more frequently) in combination with a severity score of

178

≥2 (i.e. “moderate” severity or more severe) was considered relevant. Items 6-10 are considered

179

supplementary, but were also scored according to Cotler et al. [28]. For clarity, this

180

questionnaire was not administered to support a diagnosis of ME/CFS in our participants;

181

rather, these scores were used as a tool to identify a self-reported experience of PEM.

182

For the open-ended questionnaires, the intended qualitative data analysis described in the pre-

183

registration was modified based on the detail of the responses. The open-ended questionnaires

184

were analyzed with qualitative content analysis [35]. The written responses were de-identified,

185

and two authors (RT and SY) independently read all responses several times in order to become

186

familiarized with the data. Responses were assigned codes according to a classification scheme

187

that was developed using (i) the questions on the open-ended questionnaire/knowledge about

188

PEM (e.g. experience of worsening of fatigue) and (ii) recurrent responses that arose from the

189

data (e.g. the need to nap). Responses were then coded independently, and an agreement was

190

reached on all items by RT and SY. Coded responses were then counted and summarized

191

descriptively.

192
193

Results

194

Of 18 participants (14 female), two did not complete the DSQ-PEM (missing data), and another

195

completed the exercise test but did not complete the open-ended questionnaire (due to food

196

poisoning). Participant characteristics and parameters related to the maximal exercise test are

197

presented in Table 1.

DSQ-PEM

201

In this sample of people with chronic CRF, we found that 50% of respondents indicated that

202

they experienced at least one of the first 5 items (see Table 2) at least half time at a moderate

203

or greater severity. A sub-set of participants (4/16) indicated that they feel worse after activities

204

for >24 h, and 5/16 indicated that they do not exercise because exercise makes their symptoms

205

worse. In order to apply objective criteria to help identify participants for whom PEM could be

206

an issue, we used all scoring steps recommended by Cotler et al [28] to identify people who

207

scored ≥2 for frequency and severity for any item from 1-5, plus answered “Yes” to item 7 or

208

8, plus gave a response of >14 h for item 9. Three people in this sample (19%) met these criteria

209

(and we note that all three answered ≥2 for frequency and severity on all items from 1-5,

210

answered yes for both item 7 and 8, and gave a response of >24 h for item 9).

219

There were 12 codes used for the content analysis: (1) worsening of fatigue; (2)

220

duration/recovery time; (3) change in routine; (4) reduced daily activities; (5) muscle soreness;

221

(6) weakness (7) joint pain; (8) mood; (9) memory/concentration; (10) need to nap or lie down;

222

(11) flu-like symptoms; (12) positive comments on exercise/the test. Of 17 participants, 13

223

reported a worsening of fatigue after the exercise test. Responses ranged from mild, e.g. “Felt

224

a little more tired the day after the lab visit” to more severe, e.g. “I was thoroughly exhausted.”

225
226

Of the 13 participants who experienced worsening of fatigue, seven participants had to reduce

227

their daily activities, and six had to change their routines or plans as a result of how they felt

228

after the exercise test. This ranged from relatively mild: “The only change was lying down in

229

the morning, which is unusual for me. Typically, I get through the morning and rest in some

230

way after lunch.” To more severe “The next day I stayed in bed most of the day and evening.

231

Unable to walk the dog for two days. On the third day, I cancelled a ‘coffee date’ with a friend.”

232

In an item that arose from the data, six people noted that they need to nap or lie down later on

233

the same day of the test and/or in the following days, e.g. “I lay down all 4 afternoons for a

234

rest. I don't usually do that”. Interestingly, in response to a question on the need to change

235

plans or reduce activities, one participant answered, “No. I anticipated the fatigue”, indicating

236

that they expected increased fatigue (specifically, the day after the exercise test) and had

237

planned accordingly. Also of note, is one participant who did not need to change their routine

238

because their routine is already reduced/disrupted by the fluctuation and unpredictable nature

239

of their fatigue: “I don’t usually plan anything because I don’t know how I’m going to feel

240

especially next day, [I] only plan day to day.”

241
242

It was difficult to obtain clear information on how long it took for participants fatigue to return

243

to ‘usual’ or ‘normal,’ partly because some people were unsure about their ‘usual’ or ‘normal,’

244

e.g. in the case of someone who only felt more tired later on the day of the test, they also

245

commented: “I don’t know what is abnormal for me, as things are variable.” Another

246

confounder was that three participants were unsure whether to attribute increased fatigue to the

247

test, or to other activities that were perceived as strenuous that occurred within the data

248

collection period, specifically, e.g. “more activities with family,” and “more stairs than usual.”

249

Nevertheless, of the 12 people who indicated worse fatigue, two participants only experienced

250

this on the day of the test, seven returned to typical levels within 1-3 days, e.g. “Back to normal

251

after the two days had passed.” and four were unsure if they had recovered by 96 h (when the

252

questionnaire was completed) e.g. “Each evening, I seemed to be so tired that I couldn’t do my

normal activities (research on family history). I didn’t have the energy or ability to concentrate.

254

I don’t know if I have recovered that yet because I have very little energy left by evening.”

255
256

Of 17 participants, 11 experienced muscle soreness after the test, localized to the legs and

257

mainly attributed to cycling in all but one participant, e.g. “The pain was just mild muscle pain

258

that a person feels after working muscles more than usual.” Four people experienced joint pain,

259

and five people referred to weakness. In one person, this was prolonged: “The weakness was

260

extreme and lasted in its worst state for days 3 and 4.” Seven people experienced changes in

261

mood, and seven people had worse memory/concentration, e.g. “First day, I had significant

262

problems with my short-term memory and concentration.” It is also noteworthy that one of the

263

participants who did not report worsening of memory and concentration compared to ‘normal’

264

stated that they “never feel normal,” referring to ongoing issues with memory and

265

concentration since cancer treatment. Five people experienced flu-like symptoms (e.g. “chills,

266

cold, body wet, and very sore” and “I felt generalized aching throughout my body, like the

267

flu.”). Finally, in the additional comments, four participants self-reported feeling better after

268

exercise in general, e.g. “Usually feel better after exercise” or after the test e.g. “I think in the

269

afternoon I felt invigorated and then the next two days quite a bit more tired,” and 2 people

270

commented on the test itself e.g. “I felt very supported and safe throughout the test.”

271
272

Overall, using content analysis of the open-ended questionnaires delivered after the exercise

273

test, we identified five participants (29% of this sample) for whom PEM could be an issue.

274

Specifically, these participants indicated that they experienced worsening of fatigue, plus had

275

to change routine or reduce daily activities, plus had to nap or lie down, plus experienced ≥3

276

other symptoms (including muscle soreness, weakness, joint pain, mood disturbance,

277

memory/concentration or flu-like symptoms), plus had a delayed recovery of >2 days.

Discussion

280

The purpose of this study was to investigate self-reported incidences of PEM in people with

281

chronic CRF. In line with our hypothesis, our results provide preliminary evidence that a

282

minority (up to 29% in this sample, a possible 6/18 participants) of people with chronic CRF

283

experience symptoms of PEM. This has potential implications for exercise professionals

284

working with people experiencing chronic CRF. We recommend that CRF is monitored

285

throughout an exercise program (including asking people about their symptoms between

286

individual exercise sessions, and after increases in, e.g. exercise intensity) and that trials

287

involving people with chronic CRF report this patient-level data to facilitate the understanding

288

of PEM in this context, and therefore help mitigate the potential for harm.

289
290

Content analysis of open-ended questionnaires delivered 96 h after a maximal exercise test

291

provided evidence of a constellation of symptoms, change in routine/plans, and duration of

292

recovery in people experiencing chronic CRF. Although many participants experienced a

293

worsening of fatigue, based on each participant’s profile of responses, and with particular

294

consideration of the severity of symptoms and duration of their recovery, we identified five

295

people whose descriptions were consistent with PEM. Despite qualitative comparisons

296

between chronic CRF and ME/CFS [15] and the inclusion of “PEM lasting several hours” in

297

the proposed ICD-10 criteria for CRF [10], to our knowledge, this is the first post-exercise

298

symptom characterization reported in people experiencing chronic CRF. A number of previous

299

studies have used maximal exercise tests to investigate the effects of physical exertion on

300

ME/CFS symptoms (e.g. [33]). Prolonged adverse responses to maximal exercise tests are

301

common in women with CFS (96% took >2 days to recover) and largely absent in a sedentary

302

control group (where 87% indicated full recovery within 24 h and 100% by 2 days) [33].

303

Although a maximal exercise test may be more strenuous than a typical exercise session

304

performed in line with the updated international exercise guidelines for cancer survivors [18],

305

the DSQ-PEM asks questions relating to minimal physical effort and non-strenuous, everyday

306

activities. Thus, we do not know what level of exertion provokes PEM. The current study was

307

conceived due to the need to reduce exercise intensity and carefully monitor symptom

308

exacerbation in a minority of people with chronic CRF participating in an ongoing exercise

309

trial [21]. In that trial, three participants described overwhelming exhaustion between exercise

310

sessions; therefore, little to no progression in exercise intensity or duration was made. These

311

anecdotal descriptions are in line with recent qualitative data from Penner et al. [36], where

312

fatigue was described not only as a chronic experience of imbalance but as involving “energy

313

crashes” that forced participants to “radically reshape their day-to-day lives.”

314
315

In this sample, up to 29% of participants were identified as potentially experiencing PEM (i.e.

316

met the objective criteria for the DSQ-PEM and/or described PEM in the open-ended

317

questionnaire, see also Supplementary Table 1). Two of the five participants who described

318

PEM in their responses to the open-ended questionnaire also met the DSQ-PEM criteria. Of

319

the remaining three participants, one did not complete the DSQ-PEM (missing data); a second

320

met all DSQ-PEM criteria except they answered “No” to items 7 and 8 which refer to minimal

321

effort; and the third indicated “next day soreness or fatigue after non-strenuous, everyday

322

activities” of a moderate severity about half the time and “minimum exercise makes you

323

physically tired” at 2 (“severe” but only “a little of the time”), plus “yes” to items 7 and 10

324

(experience a worsening of fatigue after engaging in minimal physical effort, and do not

325

exercise because it makes their symptoms worse). Although these latter two participants did

326

not meet all scoring criteria for the DSQ-PEM, PEM does seem to be an issue above a certain

327

intensity (i.e., above minimal), possibly explaining why the open-ended questionnaire

328

identified these participants when the DSQ-PEM did not. Finally, the DSQ-PEM identified one

329

participant who was not identified from the open-ended questionnaire. This participant did

330

report increased fatigue for 2-3 days after the exercise test but also noted, “I like exercise. I like

331

feeling strong. Like I am working toward health”. However, considering our experience of

332

their later participation in the RCT, it is our clinical judgement that PEM was an issue for them

333

(which also prevented returning to work).

334
335

Although this brief commentary about individuals is anecdotal, we believe it is important to

336

communicate about individual profiles to minimize the potential for harm. Clearly, nuance is

337

required in the interpretation of these two PEM measurements. Our goal is increased awareness

338

of PEM as a potential issue within the wider context of “exercise is medicine” in oncology

339

[37]. If exercise is medicine in chronic CRF, side-effects at a given exercise dose must be

340

carefully detailed. This will enable exercise professionals to provide the best exercise

341

prescription in people with PEM, one that can be achieved within a pacing strategy that

342

focusses on balancing rest and activity to achieve daily tasks, maintain physical function, and

343

avoid symptom exacerbation. The new exercise guidelines for cancer survivors [18]

344

acknowledge that some proportion of cancer survivors may not be able to tolerate the

345

recommendations (particularly because dose reductions may have been poorly reported in

346

previous trials). The results of this study reinforce the need to monitor tolerance and symptom

347

exacerbation, especially in those with chronic CRF. Without appropriate safeguards (e.g.

348

monitoring of fatigue throughout the exercise intervention), we do not know if people with

349

PEM continue with little symptom exacerbation (e.g. due to low effort, or individualization

350

and regular communication with an exercise professional), continue despite symptom

351

exacerbation (and experience “energy crashes” [36] that may significantly impact daily

352

activities), or drop out.

353

interventions and specifically the “precise reporting of exercise treatment adherence

354

(tolerability)” [38] must be improved. We add that these reports must include worsening of

It has been recently highlighted that the reporting of exercise

355

symptoms, including fatigue. However, we emphasize that, for the majority of people with

356

chronic CRF, exercise is likely to be beneficial for multiple and interacting components of

357

physical and mental health. With support, most participants can reach physical activity

358

guidelines (e.g. 30 minutes of aerobic activity at RPE 12, three times per week [18]) with no

359

adverse consequences. Higher intensities/longer durations can be appropriate for people with

360

chronic CRF who do not experience any adverse responses, particularly if the goal is to

361

maximize physiological adaptations.

362
363

Study Limitations and Future Directions

364

We did not include a control group and do not have data on the responses of healthy/sedentary

365

adults. However, the main purpose was to provide preliminary, rather than comprehensive

366

evidence that a minority of people with chronic CRF experience symptoms of PEM. We note

367

that in a previous study, 100% of controls recovered within 2 days of a maximal exercise test,

368

87% experienced an increased sense of wellbeing relative to the test, and none experienced

369

issues such as weakness, impaired memory/concentration or mood disturbance [33]. The DSQ-

370

PEM is not validated for use in people with CRF. However, it has been used in people with

371

multiple sclerosis and post-polio syndrome (other clinical conditions where chronic fatigue can

372

be an issue) [28]. As stated previously, we did not use the DSQ-PEM as a method to support a

373

diagnosis of ME/CFS study, especially considering the diagnostic complexity of ME/CFS

374

[39]). Here, it is used as a tool to help identify people experiencing symptoms of PEM, and any

375

further speculation on whether participants would meet any given diagnostic criteria for

376

ME/CFS if assessed by an expert clinician is out of our scope of practice. Because we were

377

unable to obtain a copy of the open-ended questionnaire used previously [33], we designed a

378

questionnaire (https://osf.io/349ky/) based on a review of the literature on PEM in ME/CFS.

379

Another limitation is that maximal incremental exercise is not a typical exercise intensity

380

prescribed within an intervention, and provides no information about the intensity of physical

381

effort (below maximal) that could result in PEM. Furthermore, although the FACIT-F has been

382

recommended to support a diagnosis of CRF [40], there is no consensus on what “diagnosis”

383

means in this context. The proposed ICD-10 criteria were not accepted, and few studies have

384

implemented them [41], and current guidelines have differing recommendations for screening

385

and assessment [7,42], and we recognize a lack of consensus for the identification of someone

386

with clinically-relevant CRF.

388

In this preliminary study, up to 29% of people appeared to experience PEM, but all participants

389

self-selected themselves into an RCT that explicitly involved a 12-week exercise intervention.

390

It is reasonable to suggest that the sample in the RCT, and therefore this sub-study, may not

391

represent the prevalence of PEM in people with chronic CRF, because people who experience

392

PEM may be less likely to enrol in an exercise trial. Future studies should estimate the

393

prevalence of PEM in people with chronic CRF. In addition, future studies should include semi-

394

structured qualitative interviews to elucidate the cancer-specific symptoms and impact of PEM.

395

In this preliminary study, we investigated people with chronic CRF, identified using a cancer-

396

related symptom onset, and presence of CRF at least 3 months and within 5 years (22 ± 14

397

months) after curative-intent cancer treatment. Because CRF is more prevalent during cancer

398

treatment [43], future work must address the potential of PEM after exercise in interventions

399

delivered during treatment. One study pre-emptively reduced the exercise prescription to

400

encourage attendance when treatment side effects (including fatigue) were anticipated to peak

401

during a chemotherapy cycle [44], but to our knowledge, there has been no post-exertional

402

symptom characterization during cancer treatment.

403
404

Conclusion

405

We found preliminary evidence that a minority of people with chronic CRF experience PEM.

406

We recommend that exercise professionals not only monitor fatigue throughout an exercise

407

program (i.e. asking participants how they felt in between individual sessions) but also report

408

this data if the exercise program is part of a clinical trial. In conclusion, the field of exercise

409

oncology must be aware that adverse responses to exercise may be an issue for a minority of

410

people with chronic CRF, and exercise interventions should be designed and adapted to

411

mitigate symptom exacerbation and limit the potential for harm.
