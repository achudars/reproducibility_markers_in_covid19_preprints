Abstract

62

Background: Life course epidemiology provides a framework for studying the effects of time-

63

varying exposures on health outcomes. The structured life course modeling approach (SLCMA)

64

is a theory-driven analytic method that empirically compares multiple prespecified life course

65

hypotheses characterizing time-dependent exposure-outcome relationships to determine which

66

theory best fits the observed data. However, the statistical properties of inference methods used

67

with the SLCMA have not been investigated with high-dimensional omics outcomes.

68
69

Methods: We performed simulations and empirical analyses to evaluate the performance of the

70

SLCMA when applied to genome-wide DNA methylation (DNAm). In the simulations, we

71

compared five statistical inference tests used by SLCMA (n=700). For each, we assessed the

72

familywise error rate (FWER), statistical power, and confidence interval coverage to determine

73

whether inference based on these tests was valid in the presence of substantial multiple testing

74

and small effect sizes, two hallmark challenges of inference from omics data. In the empirical

75

analyses, we applied the SLCMA to evaluate the time-dependent relationship of childhood abuse

76

with genome-wide DNAm (n=703).

77
78

Results: In the simulations, selective inference and max-|t|-test performed best: both controlled

79

FWER and yielded moderate statistical power. Empirical analyses using SLCMA revealed time-

80

dependent effects of childhood abuse on DNA methylation.

81
82

Conclusions: Our findings show that SLCMA, applied and interpreted appropriately, can be

83

used in the omics setting to examine time-dependent effects underlying exposure-outcome

relationships over the life course. We provide recommendations for applying the SLCMA in

85

high-throughput settings, which we hope will encourage researchers to move beyond analyses of

86

exposed versus unexposed.

Key messages:
1. The structured life course modeling approach (SLCMA) is an effective approach to

93

directly compare life course theories and can be scaled-up in the omics context to

94

examine nuanced relationships between environmental exposures over the life course and

95

biological processes.

96

2. Of the five statistical inference tests assessed in simulations, we recommend the selective

97

inference method and max-|t|-test for post-selection inference in omics applications of the

98

SLCMA.

99

3. In an empirical example, we revealed time-dependent effects of childhood abuse on DNA

100

methylation using the SLCMA, with improvement in statistical power when accounting

101

for covariates by applying the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell (FWL) theorem.

102

4. Researchers should assess p-values in parallel with effects sizes and confidence intervals,

103

as triangulating multiple forms of statistical evidence can strengthen inferences and point

104

to new directions for replication.

Introduction
Epidemiologists have long been interested in whether and how exposures over the life

107

course affect later health outcomes. Guided by theories developed in life course epidemiology1

108

(Table 1), researchers are moving beyond simple comparisons of the presence versus absence of

109

exposure to characterize time-dependent exposure-outcome relationships.2 Prior work in life

110

course epidemiology has conceptualized timing effects in numerous ways, examining the role of

111

the developmental timing of exposure (sensitive period hypothesis), the number of occasions

112

exposed across time (accumulation of risk hypothesis), proximity in time to exposure (recency

113

hypothesis), and change in exposure status across time (mobility hypothesis). Researchers have

114

adopted this life course perspective, uncovering mechanistic insights that advanced many

115

subfields of public health and medicine.7–11 As different life course hypotheses correspond to

116

distinct theories of disease etiology, efforts to formally compare competing hypotheses and

117

identify those best supported by empirical data are needed to guide prevention and intervention

118

planning.

119

To address the need for systematic comparisons of life course theories, Mishra and

120

colleagues introduced the structured life course modeling approach (SLCMA).3 The SLCMA

121

allows researchers to compare a set of a priori-specified life course theories and use goodness-of-

122

fit criteria to determine which theory is best supported by the empirical data. Smith and

123

colleagues later extended this approach by outlining an alternative statistical model selection

124

strategy that makes use of least angle regression (LARS),12 accommodates both binary and

125

continuous exposures, 4,5 and improves the accuracy of selecting the correct hypothesis. More

126

recently, Madathil et al. proposed a Bayesian approach to life course modeling that does not

127

perform variable selection, but rather estimates the posterior probability corresponding to each

128

theoretical hypothesis while assessing the relative importance of a series of life course theories

129

altogether. 13 Since its inception, the SLCMA has been applied in a wide range of non-omic

130

epidemiologic studies, including those examining the time-dependent impacts of childhood

131

trauma, physical activity, or socioeconomic position on psychological, metabolic, and disease

132

outcomes.6,14–19

133

The growing availability of high-dimensional biological and phenotype data from

134

longitudinal cohort studies has created new opportunities to test life course theories in

135

epigenomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, and other omics settings. While large cross-

136

sectional omics studies have identified associations between biological differences and various

137

traits,20 applications of the SLCMA to longitudinal data and high dimensional outcomes allow

138

researchers to answer more complex questions about disease mechanisms, including: Are there

139

sensitive periods when environmental exposures induce more underlying molecular changes

140

compared to those occurred during other time periods? Do exposures form a dose-response

141

relationship, regardless of their timing? Do more proximal events matter more compared to distal

142

events? As an example, Dunn and colleagues applied the SLCMA in a longitudinal birth cohort

143

study to model timing effects of childhood adversity on DNA methylation, which is a widely

144

studied epigenetic mechanism that could give rise to altered gene expression and phenotypic

145

changes. Using the SLCMA, they found that DNAm differences were largely explained by the

146

age at exposure, with the first three years of life appearing to be a sensitive period associated

147

with more DNAm differences. Interestingly, the SLCMA found associations not uncovered in

148

EWAS of exposed versus unexposed to childhood adversity.22

149

As outlined in Dunn et al.,22 application of the SLCMA to omics data presents unique

150

challenges that have not been systematically investigated. First, it remains unknown whether

151

theoretical properties of statistical inference, such as Type I error (i.e., family-wise error rate

152

(FWER) in the presence of multiple testing) or confidence interval (CI) coverage, are valid in

153

omics data. Second, it is unclear whether the SLCMA is sufficiently powered to detect the small

154

effects commonly found in omics settings. Third, questions exist on how to balance decision-

155

making regarding research evidence; omics studies often rely on p-value thresholds whereas

156

epidemiologists and others increasingly prioritize other statistical evidence, such as effect sizes

157

and CIs.23,24 We therefore performed both simulations and empirical analyses to assess the

158

performance of the SLCMA when applied to omics data and illustrate how SLCMA can be

159

applied to evaluate the time-dependent role of childhood abuse on genome-wide DNA

160

methylation.

Methods
The Structured Life Course Modeling Approach (SLCMA): An Overview
The SLCMA has been described in detail elsewhere. 3–5 In brief, the SLCMA is a two-

164

stage method that compares a set of life course hypotheses describing the relationship between

165

exposures assessed over time and some outcome of interest. In the first stage of the SLCMA,

166

each life course hypothesis is encoded into a predictor or set of predictor variables. Examples of

167

the predictors that represent commonly studied life course hypotheses are shown in Table 1. A

168

variable selection procedure is then used to select the subset of predictors that explain the

169

greatest proportion of outcome variation. While it is possible for multiple predictors to be

170

selected, the high dimensionality of the omics setting makes consideration more feasible of

171

simple life course hypotheses (meaning those in which the exposure-outcome association is

172

represented by a single predictor). Therefore, in this study, we focused on statistical inference

173

regarding the single predictor that explains the greatest variation in the outcome.

174

In the second stage of the SLCMA, post-selection inference is performed to obtain point

175

estimates (of the direction and magnitude of effects) and confidence intervals (a measure of

176

effect uncertainty) of the effects for the hypotheses identified from the first stage. Post-selection

177

inference methods are used to derive unbiased test statistics because they account for the

178

multiple testing that occurs when comparing multiple hypotheses, as the SLCMA iteratively

179

works to select the variable with the strongest association with the outcome. Four primary

180

inference methods that account for this “selective nature” are: (1) Bonferroni correction; (2)

181

max-|t|-test;25 (3) covariance test;26,27 and (4) selective inference.28,29 These approaches are

182

described in detail in the Supplementary Materials.

185

Simulation Analyses
We performed simulations to examine the performance of these four post-selection

186

inference methods compared to a naïve calculation (summarized in Table 2). To build these

187

simulations in the context of a real-world application, we modeled the simulation strategy based

188

on the genome-wide SLCMA study performed by Dunn et al.22 We evaluated each post-selection

189

inference method with respect to three statistical properties: family-wise error rate (FWER) (the

190

probability of making one or more false discoveries out of multiple tests), statistical power (the

191

probability of correctly selecting the predictor with a true association with the outcome), and CI

192

coverage (the probability that a 95% CI contained the true effect estimate). Assessing these

193

properties enabled us to determine whether inference based on these tests was valid in the

194

presence of multiple testing and small effect sizes, which are two hallmarks of high-dimensional

195

data. Mathematical definitions of the test-statistics as well as the procedure for constructing

196

confidence intervals are included in the Supplemental Materials. Example R code for

197

implementing all methods described in this study are also provided in the Supplemental

198

Materials.

199

We considered two scenarios, which differed in the nature of the simulated outcome:

200
201
202

Scenario 1: Normal outcomes
In the first scenario, we simulated exposure to childhood sexual or physical abuse based

203

on empirical data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC), a

204

population-based birth cohort.30–32 The outcome was simulated from a normal distribution and

205

the sample size was set to 700 to be consistent with ALSPAC. Simulations were based on m=485

206

000 tests corresponding to an analysis of Illumina Methylation 450k Beadchip data and a

207

standard genome-wide significance threshold of p<10−7. To assess FWER under the null

208

hypothesis, we ran a single simulation of 485 000 tests and examined the distributions of

209

observed p-values against their expected distribution. To assess statistical power and CI

210

coverage, we ran simulations in which the outcome variable was correlated with one of the

211

predictors and then varied the correlation between outcome and predictor such that the variance

212

explained by the predictor varied from 0.01 to 0.1. This range of values was chosen to illustrate

213

poor and good statistical power, respectively.

214
215

Scenario 2: Empirical outcomes

216

To further examine the performance of post-selection inference methods in an empirical

217

setting, we combined real predictors from ALSPAC capturing repeatedly measured exposure to

218

childhood sexual or physical abuse as described above and an outcome variable that more closely

219

resembled the data distribution of DNAm at a single locus (meaning the proportion of cells in

220

which the cytosine at the locus is methylated). To assess the FWER under the null hypothesis,

221

we resampled the real predictors and DNAm values from ALSPAC separately. The resampling

222

breaks the predictor-outcome link and hence removes any observed association between the two,

223

while maintaining the empirical distributions of DNAm, which may not be normal. To assess

224

statistical power and CI coverage, we simulated the outcome from a beta distribution, as

225

proposed by Tsai and Bell.33 Effect sizes were parameterized as the difference in mean levels of

226

DNAm between the exposed and unexposed groups (ΔDNAm), ranging from 0.05 to 0.5. The

227

number of tests and p-value threshold were the same as Scenario 1. We additionally considered a

228

transformation of the DNAm values from beta values (y) to M values equivalent to

229

M=log2(y/(1−y)), which are sometimes used to stabilize variance.34

230
231

Empirical Analyses

232

To illustrate how the SLCMA and the different corresponding post-selection inference

233

methods work in practice, we reanalyzed data used by Dunn et al.22 Briefly, we compared the

234

effects of sensitive period, accumulation, and recency hypotheses for the associations between

235

exposure to sexual or physical abuse and genome-wide DNA methylation at age 7 in ALSPAC

236

participants. Sample characteristics and adversity measures are described in Supplemental

237

Materials. Building from that study, which only used the covariance test, we additionally

238

applied the other three post-selection inference methods summarized earlier. We also tested a

239

new method for covariate adjustment that could be used alongside any post-selection inference

240

method. Based on the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell (FWL) theorem, this method regresses the outcome

241

on covariates in parallel and enters the residuals into the model selection procedure.35–37 A more

242

thorough description of this method and a full list of the covariates are available in the

243

Supplemental Materials.

Simulation Analyses
Table 3 summarizes the main findings from the simulation analyses with regard to the
statistical properties and implementation of the assessed methods.

249
250

Family-wise error rate

251

Due to the high computational burden of genome-wide association studies, we illustrate

252

FWER control of each inference test using a single simulation with m=485 000 tests. As shown

253

in Figures 1 and 2, when compared against the expected p-value distribution under the null

254

hypothesis, the p-values obtained from naïve calculations appeared too liberal in both scenarios,

255

as suggested by the systematic upward departure from the diagonal line. P-values from the

256

covariance test were also smaller than expected across scenarios.

257

With normally distributed outcomes in Scenario 1, the p-values from the Bonferroni

258

correction, max-|t|-test, and selective inference method followed the expected distribution closely

259

(Figure 1). With empirical DNAm outcomes in Scenario 2, p-values from the three methods

260

seemed too conservative (Figure 2). Transforming the DNAm (beta) values to M-values did not

261

affect the results (Figure S1). Together, these findings suggest that three methods adequately

262

controlled the FWER: Bonferroni correction, the max-|t|-test, and the selective inference method.

263
264

Estimates of FWER from repeated simulation experiments when the number of tests
ranged from m=1 to 1000 are available in the Supplemental Materials.

267

We assessed the statistical power of the three methods that adequately controlled FWER.

268

We did not evaluate the performance of the covariance test or naïve calculation, as these methods

269

had smaller than expected p-values under the null hypothesis in all simulations. Inclusion of

270

these methods would have thus resulted in an unfair comparison, as their statistical power is

271

inflated by their tendency to fail to reject the null hypothesis.

272

Figure 3 shows the estimated statistical power as a function of effect sizes tested both

273

with normal and empirical outcomes. There was very little difference in statistical power

274

between the three methods; they all had ideal statistical power (over 80%) when the effects were

275

moderate to large (R2 > 0.06 in scenario 1; ΔDNAm > 0.25 in scenario 2).

276

Figure 4 shows CI coverage as a function of effect size. With normal outcomes, the

277

selective inference achieved ideal coverage (around 95%) across all effect sizes with sample size

278

n = 700; the max-|t|-test had slightly lower coverage when the effect size was small (R2 < 0.03).

279

With empirical (beta distributed) outcomes, the CI coverage probabilities were below the desired

280

level (95%) when the between-group difference (ΔDNAm ) was below 0.3, though exceeded 95%

281

as the effect size increased. Bonferroni corrected CIs were over-conservative across effect sizes

282

and scenarios, as expected.

283
284
285

Empirical Analyses
Using the covariance test, Dunn and colleagues identified five CpG sites in ALSPAC that

286

showed differential methylation profiles at age 7 following exposure to physical or sexual abuse

287

in childhood; the “sensitive period” model was the selected life course theory for these five sites.

288

We reanalyzed the genome-wide SLCMA analyses using two other post-selection inference

289

methods that showed no inflation in FWER and desired CI coverage: the max-|t|-test and

290

selective inference method. Results are shown in Table S1. While neither method identified any

291

CpG site as significantly associated using a stringent Bonferroni corrected p-value threshold of

292

p<1x10-7, the CpG site with the smallest p-value from the covariance test (cg06430102)

293

remained the CpG with the smallest p-value (out of the 485 000 CpG sites tested) for the two

294

alternative methods (Table S1). The CI calculated based on the covariance test, selective

295

inference, and the max-|t|-test substantially overlapped (Figure 5; Table S1).

296

After applying the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell (FWL) theorem to additionally adjust for

297

covariates, the p-values decreased at all five loci (Figure S2), suggesting that the approach

298

improved statistical power and additionally controlled for any bias that may be caused by

299

confounding.

300

On a genome-wide level, Table S2 shows the overlap in most strongly associated loci

301

based on results obtained from the three methods assessed in the empirical analyses to compare

302

the preferred alternative methods to the widely-used (but now identified as inflated) covariance

303

test. The concordance between the liberal covariance test and recommended selective inference

304

method was high, implying that both methods agreed on the loci with the strongest associations

305

with the exposure.

Discussion

307

As the availability of longitudinal biological and phenotypic data grows, methods from

308

life course epidemiology can be translated to “harness the ‘omics’ revolution” 7 and reveal

309

critical insights about how exposures become biologically embedded. We showed that one such

310

method – the SLCMA – is an effective approach to directly compare life course theories and can

311

be scaled-up to answer nuanced questions about complex and time-dependent exposure-omics

312

relationships. Importantly, not all methods for statistical inference in the SLCMA are suitable in

313

high-throughput applications. Based on our findings, we recommend the selective inference

314

method and max-|t|-test for post-selection inference in omics applications. Our simulations also

315

showed that statistical power to detect effects depended on effect size, but not necessarily on the

316

post-selection inference method used. When deciding between these two inference methods,

317

researchers will need to consider several factors, including goals of analysis and study-specific

318

contexts, as both methods have strengths and limitations in these areas (Supplemental

319

Materials). The simulation analyses highlight the value of using simulations in scientific

320

research,39,40 especially when theoretical assumptions may be violated in a new application

321

setting.

322

In the empirical analyses, we also showed that evaluating multiple forms of evidence can

323

help contextualize the SLCMA findings in omics applications, though statistical significance

324

based on p-values may differ across methods. Researchers should assess p-values in parallel with

325

effects sizes and confidence intervals, as decision rules of significance based on p-values of one

326

method may be biased due to inflation or overcorrection. While it remains challenging to draw

327

definitive conclusions about the presence versus absence of an effect, triangulating evidence

328

from multiple sources and methods may suggest directions for future replication.41 For example,

329

a CpG that was identified as the top site by multiple methods and showed substantial changes in

330

methylation levels between exposed versus unexposed individuals may be more likely to capture

331

effects of the exposure and worth pursuing in experimental validation.

332

Several limitations are noted. First, although we varied the effect size and compared

333

normal versus empirical distributions of the outcome, we did not assess diverse correlation

334

structures or distributions in the exposures tested, as it was not possible given the number of

335

possible combinations of these parameters. Thus, we encourage researchers to perform their

336

own simulations to arrive at a better understanding of the statistical properties of the SLCMA in

337

their specific research context. Second, we restricted our analyses to the application of linear

338

regression-based model selection; a brief discussion on the possibility of implementing post-

339

selection inference methods for generalized linear models is included in the Supplemental

340

Materials. Third, as suggested by the simulations, a typical longitudinal epigenetic study with a

341

sample size under 1000 is likely underpowered to detect small effects. One approach to improve

342

statistical power is to combine data or summary results from multiple samples and perform a

343

mega/meta-analysis; developing methods to meta-analyze results from SLCMA analyses is an

344

important goal of future work. Another approach is to use the FWL theorem for covariate

345

adjustment, which as shown in this paper led to improvement in power.

346

In conclusion, the SLCMA is a useful approach that brings the life course perspective

347

into the omics context. This analysis framework can reveal site-specific mechanisms, as well as

348

system-level pathways. Compared to an analysis that only categorized exposure status as

349

exposed versus unexposed, the SLCMA not only offers additional mechanistic insights, but also

350

increases statistical power when the true underlying exposure-outcome relationship is more

351

nuanced.22 As a field, we should move beyond analyses of the presence versus absence of

Life course theory
Sensitive period The developmental timing

Encoding

Example
abuseperiod1 (X1)=exposed (1) vs.

Accumulation

Every additional time point
of exposure affects the
outcome in a dose-response
manner, independent of the
exposure timing.

The accumulated sum of the
number of exposure occasions
(A) is linearly associated with
the outcome.

A = X1 + … + X m

abuseaccumulation (A) =count of the
number of time periods exposed to
abuse (range 0-6)

Recency

More proximal exposures,
meaning those that happen
closer in time to the
measurement of the
outcome, are more strongly
linked to the outcome
compared to distal
exposures.

The weighted sum (R) of the
number of exposure occasions
is linear associated with the
outcome such that the weight
of each exposure is
proportional to the age at the
time of measurement.

R = X1T1 + … + XmTm

The notations are based on the description of hypotheses by Smith et al.4 Let X1, …, Xm be a set of m repeated binary measures of exposure
(0=unexposed; 1=exposed) and T1… Tm the corresponding age at the time of measurement. Xj represents the measure at the jth measurement occasion.
Examples of how the life course theories could be encoded are shown in the last column, which were tested in the empirical analyses of epigenomewide SLCMA of exposure to physical or sexual abuse in childhood. Of note, the accumulation models can also be parameterized differently, such as
with non-linear effects (“u-shaped” or “j-shaped” relationships). However, for simplicity, we provide the simplest definition of accumulation here,
which is also often the most often tested.

The table is divided into two approaches: to assess the familywise error rate, we simulated the exposures and outcomes to have no association with each other
(i.e., under the null hypothesis), and ran a single simulation of 485 000 tests to examine the distributions of observed p-values against the expected distribution. To
assess the power and confidence interval coverage under the alternative hypothesis, we ran 2 000 simulation experiments to allow the confidence interval (CI) of
the assessed metrics (i.e., power and CI coverage) to have a radius (i.e., margin of error) of 1%, setting α to 5%. The two metrics of effect sizes were different
with normal versus empirical outcomes due to the difference in the underlying data generating processes.
Sample size was set to n=700 in all simulations based on the sample size of the empirical study.
R2: variance of the outcome explained by the selected predictor.
