ABSTRACT
With the objective to perform a first evaluation of the impact of the integration of a graphic
spatial epidemiology tool that allows quasi-realtime georeferenced data visualization into a
telemedicine infrastructure, this work presents GISTelemed, an online module specialized on
indexing structured and semi-structured data, as well as querying the indexed content using
structured and free-text search.
We evaluated GISTelemed accordingly to the guidelines published by the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention and input provided by a questionnaire customized according
to AdEQUATE (questionnAire for Evaluation of QUAlity in TElemedicine systems).
39 healthcare professionals from 13 municipalities participated in the evaluation. We
analyzed data from questionnaires using descriptive statistics, being Lernability and Comfort
the characteristics that received the best evaluation. Quantitative evaluation based upon
leprosis cases detected through tele-dermatology showed a sensitivity and PPV of
respectively 77.2% and 95.3%. 22.8% of the cases detected were un-notified cases.
Results from our case study show a good evaluation regarding the perceived software
quality”. We conclude that the integration of spatial epidemiology tools to the STT/SC
system, besides enabling visualization of data in maps, allowed users to analyze the evolution
of morbidities and their co-occurrences.

INTRODUCTION
Data analysis regarding mortality and survival rates has allowed the examination of multiple
dimensions of health.[1] Spatial Epidemiology is the description and analysis of geographic
variations in disease. In the last years, advances in Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
and availability of high-resolution, geographically referenced health and environmental
quality data have created unprecedented new opportunities to investigate local geographic
variations in disease.[2] In this context, data relevant to the understanding of health and
disease are nowadays found in diverse sources besides formal Electronic Health Records
(EHR), but also in imaging, teleconsulting and other data, indicating that, for better
epidemiological analyses, we need big data approaches that are able to integrate these data
also.[3] Additionally, GIS offer unique opportunities to integrate data across multiple
databases and spatial scales for display, management, and analysis.[4]
On the other hand, emerging countries have experienced fast and complex epidemiological
changes due to the increasing rates of chronic, communicable and noncommunicable diseases.
[5-6] In this context, Brazil has been employing information systems developed for its
National Unified Public Health System (SUS), including the Brazilian National Information
System on Reportable Diseases (SINAN) for collecting and processing data on mandatory
communicable diseases.[7]
Event notification processes, however, are sensitive to incomplete and/or incorrect data,
resulting in the inaccurate evaluation of epidemiological studies performed on these data.[8]
A number of studies have reported difficulties in collecting reliable data for many
communicable diseases, compromising its epidemiological monitoring.[9-12] The lack of
widespread EHRs and interoperability gaps between systems contribute on delays and on
disseminating errors.[9]
To be able to rely additionally on other systems can help support epidemiological
monitoring.
As supporting tools for data acquisition and consolidation, telemedicine technologies, which
are, by nature, integrated and online, have become relevant as a basis for epidemiological
studies.[13-15] Due to its distributed, unconstrained geographical reach, such technologies
allow

the

data

acquisition

from

telediagnosis

and

teleconsultation,

assisting

the

epidemiological surveillance through online identification and monitoring of public health
issues.[16] The acquired data could contribute to improve epidemiological investigations and
disease control, helping healthcare policy makers to direct resources and relocate
professionals based on concrete scenarios.[17-18] Despite this potential as epidemiological
evidence gathering tools, telemedicine systems have not yet been integrated into
epidemiological databases or search tools.[2-3]

An example of a well-established telemedicine infrastructure is the Santa Catarina State
Integrated Telemedicine and Telehealth System (STT/SC), a statewide public telemedicine
network located at the State of Santa Catarina, Brazil. Developed since 2005 through a
partnership between the Santa Catarina's State Health Department (SES/SC) and the
Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC), STT/SC provides asynchronous telemedicine
and

telehealth

services

via

web

and

mobile

applications,

supporting

radiology,

electrocardiography, dermatology, clinical analyses, and healthcare education.[19-20] The
network stores structured and semi-structured data for more than five million examinations.
OBJECTIVES AND STATE OF THE ART
The main research question leading this research was: In a country lacking real-time and
short-time disease monitoring resources such as Brazil, is it useful to employ the onlinereadiness and real-time nature of a Telemedicine infrastructure to provide georreferenced
epidemiological data?
With the objective to evaluate the integration of a spatial epidemiology tool that allows
georeferenced data visualization into a telemedicine infrastructure, this work presents
GISTelemed - a module of STT/SC specialized on indexing structured and semi-structured
data, as well as querying the indexed content using structured and free-text search
predicates. GISTelemed offers quasi-real-time georefrenced data, collected from different
sources, ranging from patient interviews at primary care facilities to high-complexity imaging
examinations such as MRI and CT, integrated into a GIS. It allows small-area analyses,
encompassing disease mapping and geographic correlation studies. This creates new
opportunities to investigate local geographic variations in disease [2]. Preliminary results
attest its viability, allowing the multiple-source telemedicine content to be used as a basis for
epidemiological studying and monitoring.
We evaluate GISTelemed using both the guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance
systems, published by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),[21] and
also AdEQUATE (questionnAire for Evaluation of QUAlity in TElemedicine systems), an
evaluation model customized to specificities and needs of telemedicine systems based on the
ISO/IEC 25010 standard, the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and the System
Usability Scale (SUS).[22-25]
A detailed literature review on spatial epidemiology systems and tools would exceed the
scope of this paper, but an analysis of the state of the art of the late 1990’s and early
2000’s.is given in [2] and a discussion of the present state of the art is given in [26]. We
could not identify any database or tool with the search and visualization capabilities of the
GISTelemed that encompasses data from a population such as the population of an entire
State of a large Latin American country and also updates on quasi real-time.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
GISTelemed is a module responsible for the extraction, georeferencing, indexing, search,
retrieval, and visualization of content acquired from data sources managed by STT/SC.
Architecture of GISTelemed
The system offers a dataflow organized in five steps, as follows (see figure 1):
● ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process - responsible for accessing structured
(relational database instances) and semi-structured (PACS - Picture Archiving and
Communication System instances) data sources, collecting its content for indexing.
Individual ETL jobs were created to satisfy specificities of each dataset (e.g. clinical
analyses for HIV, dengue fever, hepatitis B, and toxoplasmosis from the Central
Laboratory of Public Health - LACEN - information system, examinations in
cardiology and dermatology from the STT information system, DICOM - Digital
Imaging and Communications in Medicine - objects from PACS), being executed by a
multiprotocol, open source interconnection engine (Mirth Connect). The acquired
content is processed and converted into XML (eXtensible Markup Language)
documents, sent via HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) to the search engine
component.
● Search engine component - responsible for indexing content received from the ETL
process, as well as for the execution of search and retrieval according to queries sent
from the user interface. Built on top of an open source search server (Apache Solr),
the search engine uses information retrieval techniques (e.g. stemming, stop words) to
improve free text and structured query processing.
● Pre- and post-processing operations - responsible,

respectively,

for

the

standardization of input filters selected by users and for the normalization of query
results to be send to the GUI (Graphical User Interface).
● User interface - responsible for the interaction of both experienced and inexperienced
users with the system, it organizes input filters allowing the configuration of ondemand queries together with the choice of results to be displayed in tables, charts,
and maps.

The GUI (figure 2) is designed to support both experienced and inexperienced users in
performing queries and epidemiological analyses. The filter tool (a) allows to select search
parameters from a predefined set of filters based upon the controlled vocabularies employed
for the indexation of the databases, as well as to use free text search. The interface also
allows the user to choose which resulting data is to be displayed using a drag-and-drop
mechanism.
The graphic output tool displays the search results as charts (b), tables (c), and three types
of maps: occurrences (d), heat maps (e), and a multiresolution choropletic representation
that represents the results as areas of influence and can show the result per county, per
municipality or per individual healthcare facilities, employing municipality borders and
Voronoi diagrams as intra-municipal delimiters (f, g and h). The map of the Santa Catarina
state is loaded using the WMS (Web Map Service) provided by SIG@SC, a service previously
developed at our research group as a partnership between the Federal University of Santa
Catarina (UFSC) and the Santa Catarina State Datacenter (CIASC) that offers public access
to vector and raster geographic data. [27]

maps: occurrence circles (d), heat map (e), and as choroplethic map, showing municipalities (f) and
voronoi diagrams depicting influence areas of individual healthcare facilities (g and h).

Another feature from GISTelemed is the timeline simulation: the user can take the results of
a search and ask GISTelemed to present them in an animated timeline, where occurrences
are shown in adjustable intervals and with a preajusted geographical granularity (county,
municipality or healthcare facility). In Figure 3 the distribution of skin cancer cases in Santa
Catarina between 2015 and 2018 was first calculated and then simulated month-wise,
showing their municipalities of occurrence: figure 3(a) shows cases for January 2018 and
figure 3(b) shows cases for August 2018. A slider automatically advances the timeline,

site, at: http://site.telemedicina.ufsc.br/gistelemed/. The first video provided with this
additional material shows several examples of this feature.

Evaluation strategy
We evaluated GISTelemed accordingly to the guidelines published by the US Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).[21] Due to its specificity, each attribute was assessed
individually using criteria from the related literature, data from information systems
available to this work, and input provided by a questionnaire customized according to
AdEQUATE (questionnAire for Evaluation of QUAlity in TElemedicine systems). [22-25]
Evaluation Dataset
We evaluated GISTelemed using:


data from 62,393

tele-dermatoscopic examinations, covering cases of leprosy, skin

cancer and psoriasis (23,271 cases) and other dermatoses (39,122 cases), performed
between January/2015 and December/2017, employing the protocols defined in [28],


and,
responses from 39 healthcare professionals working in the Public Health area to the
AdEQUATE questionnaire.

When data collection started (see Figure 4..a) there were 77 primary healthcare facilities in
73 municipalities of the State performing tele-dermatological examinations and triage. In
December 2017 there were 313 facilities in 284 municipalities habilitated to perform teledermatological examinations. 16 of the new facilities implanted during the period were
located in prisons. Most new facilities were implanted during 2015. During the data
collection period, an average of 1,733.14 examinations/month was performed (see Figure
4..b).

Gound Truth
As a ground truth to compare our epidemiological data against we chose the data on leprosy
registered on the Brazilian National Information System on Reportable Diseases (SINAN).[7]
Figure 5. shows a comparison between the 528 leprosy cases reported on SINAN and the 114
leprosy cases identified through tele-dermatology during the period 2015-2017.

Evaluation Parameters
In order to adhere to both [21] and [22-25], we evaluated GISTelemed according to the
following criteria:
● Usefulness - degree to which a user is satisfied with its perceived achievement of
pragmatic goals, including the contribution to the prevention and control of adverse
health-related events or if it helps to determine that an adverse health-related event,
previously thought to be unimportant, is actually important. This attribute was
evaluated by the Usefulness subcharacteristic of the AdEQUATE model, assessing the
degree to which a user is satisfied with its perceived achievement of pragmatic goals
by using GISTelemed.
● Simplicity - structuredness and ease of operation of GISTelemed. This attribute was
evaluated by the Usability characteristic of the AdEQUATE model, assessing the
degree to which a product or system can be used by specific users.
● Flexibility - system's adaptability to changes in the information needs or operating
conditions. This attribute was evaluated by the Flexibility subcharacteristic of the
AdEQUATE model, assessing the degree to which GISTelemed can be used in
contexts beyond the ones initially specified.
● Data quality - completeness and validity of data stored by the system. We evaluated
the completeness of patient and diseases data collected by GISTelemed, considering
excellent data where the percentage of completeness is greater than 90%; good a
percentage of completeness between 70.1% and 90%; and poor when the percentage of
completeness is equal to or less than 70%.
● Acceptability - willingness of individuals and organizations to participate in using the
system. Was measured by analyzing interview completion rates and question refusal
rates, evaluated by the percentage of users who accepted to contribute with the study
answering the available questionnaire.
● Sensitivity - proportion of all cases identified by the system that were also confirmed
through and identifiable notification in SINAN to all cases retrieved by the system.
This attribute was evaluated by comparing confirmed cases of leprosy registered both
in GISTelemed and SINAN. Other diseases whose cases are registered in GISTelemed
(skin cancer, psoriasis and other dermatoses) were excluded from this part of the
evaluation due to the unavailability of a notification system for comparison. We
employed the following formula:

Sensitivity( HD)=

notifications (HD : GISTelemed)
notifications (HD : GISTelemed) +unnotified diagnoses(HD : GISTelemed)

● Positive Predictive Value (PPV) – proportion of all leprosy cases notified in SINAN
to the leprosy cases (Hansen’s disease = HD) notified in SINAN plus all retrieved
cases in GISTelemed where leprosy was a diagnosis dermatoscopically confirmed by a

medical report issued by a dermatologist but that were absent in the SINAN
database. We employed the following formula:

PPV (HD )=

notifications(HD : SINAN )
notifications (HD : SINAN )+ unnotifieddiagnoses( HD :GISTelemed )

● Representativeness - degree to which the system accurately describes the occurrence
of a health-related event over time and its distribution in the population by place and
person. This attribute was also evaluated comparing leprosy cases in both
GISTelemed and SINAN. For this purpose we employed a correllation analysis
between the two curves and also a Bland-Altman plot analysis.
● Stability - ability of the system to collect, manage, and provide data satisfactorily,
and to be operational and accessible when it is required for use. This attribute was
evaluated by the Reliability characteristic of the AdEQUATE model, including its
Maturity, Availability, Fault tolerance and Recoverability subcharacteristics, in order
to assess the degree with which GISTelemed performs specific functions, under
specific conditions, for a specific period of time.
Software quality assessment
We invited users of STT/SC to follow a predefined script using GISTelemed to perform a set
of search and retrieval tasks. Once the tasks were concluded, the participants filled the
questionnaire intended to collect data on their perception of quality regarding GISTelemed.
All questionnaire items were formulated as assertions, aiming to eliminate misinterpretation
and to reduce the probability of error in responses. The responses follow a 4-point Likert
scale, including the alternatives "Not applicable", "Don’t know”, and “Don’t understand the
item”, and were used to compute the distribution of each option for each questionnaire item,
using a SUS-like approach for summarization.[29-30]
We analyzed the responses to the questionnaire using descriptive statistics, adopting the
median as a representative for the middle of the distribution, and quartiles for grouping.[ 30]
The score of responses given to each questionnaire item was calculated in a similar way of
SUS scores,

varies from 0 (poorest degree of quality – i.e. all respondents choose “Totally disagree”) to
100 (exceptional degree of quality – i.e. all respondents choose “Totally agree”).[31]

RESULTS
From a total of 48 invitations, 39 healthcare professionals working in Epidemiological
Vigilance and other Public Health-related areas from 13 municipalities of the Santa Catarina
State accepted to participate on the assessment (a response rate of 81.2%). The distribution
of the respondents by occupation is given in Figure 6..

Figure 6. Distributions of respondents by occupation

All examinations were performed at primary healthcare facilities, where a local general
practitioner performed the patient assessment and a trained technician performed the
dermatoscopic examination. Data were uploaded using the telemedicine system and a teledermatologist analyzed the patients’ assessment report and the dermatoscopic examination
and provided a triage report. We identified 114 leprosy cases with GISTelemed. Of these, 26
were cases we could not identify in SINAN, which we treated as unnotified cases, totaling
22.8% of all cases identified with GISTelemed, mostly from small upstate municipalities. A
comparison of occurrences per municipality is shown in the Appendix Occurrences Monitored
per Municipality.
System Performance
From the point of view of data quality, search results with GISTelemed are shown in Table
1.: we identified a completion rate of 93.77% associated to the data provided by the primary
health care facilities that first examined the patients.

Sensitivity, Positive Predictive Value and Representativeness
The sensitivity and PPV of GISTelemed for predicting notified leprosy cases were
respectively 77.2% and 95.3%, when employing the formulas given above. From the point of
view of representativeness, the correlation of the SINAN and GISTelemed leprosy curves
shown in Figure 5. was 0.14348 for the whole 2015-2017 period. The correlations for
individual years were respectively -0.01922 for 2015, 0.44495 for 2016 and 0.37384 for 2017. A
Bland-Altman plot analysis showed a bias of 11.22 between both curves; with 95% confidence
interval between 1.82 and 20.63. There were two outliers: January 2015, with a difference of
-1 and November 2015, with a difference of 28. Figure 7. shows the comparison of SINAN
and GISTelemed by a scatter plot (a) and a Bland-Altman plot (b).

Software Quality
We analyzed the data acquired through the questionnaires using descriptive statistics, as
described above. Scores for each subcharacteristic are presented in Figure 8., varying from 0
to 100. With a median over 50, we observed a good perception of the quality of GISTelemed.
The interquartile range of 14.4 demonstrates low variability between groups.
Some subcharacteristics shown as “Bellow Quartile 1” received low scores because the
responses “Not

applicable”, “Don’t understand the item”, and “Don’t

know” were not

considered in the score calculation, especially the subcharacteristics with a score below 50
that have less than 60% of the responses scored positively or negatively. We can also observe
in Figure 8. that, according to the users, the worst subcharacteristics are “Accessibility”,
“Interoperability” and “Recoverability”. Nevertheless, since the median is over 50, a positive
perception of the quality for GISTelemed can be noticed. Figure 9. presents the proportion
of responses by the ISO/IEC 25010 standard subcharacteristics. We can observe differences
in the position for some subcharacteristics when compared to Figure 8.; it occurs because the
chart in Figure 9. shows the real distribution of answers, and it is presented in descending

order, subcharacteristics evaluated positively first. “Time-behavior”, for instance, despite
having the same score of “Efficiency” calculated by (1), has a better position due to its
greater number of positive responses. We also observed that more than 50% of the users
answered “Not applicable” or “Don’t know” for the subacharacteristics “Recoverability”,
“Interoperability”, and “Accessibility”; it is an indication that users may had difficulty with
these concepts, or that respondents lacked experience using GISTelemed. “Accessibility”,
having more than 70% of its responses being “Not applicable”, may indicate an issue in
GISTelemed regarding this subcharacteristic, or a bias in selecting respondents – from all
participants, no one had disabilities.

DISCUSSION
We presented GISTelemed, a georeferenced epidemiological analysis tool integrated into a
Telemedicine and Telehealth Information System. Intended to be used by medical staff,
public health policymakers, and researchers, the module was developed to help on the study
of chronic and infectious conditions, on guiding the healthcare decision-making; and on
contributing to the development, monitoring and evaluation of interventionist actions for
controlling and preventing diseases, providing fast feedback to public health policies. For the
quantitative evaluation of GISTelemed, even if the STT/SC stores data from a broad
spectrum of examinations, ranging from simples patient interviews up to magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, we limited the scope to dermatology
data because, for a part of these data (leprosy cases), we were able to compare our results

with an external reference, which we took as our golden standard: the leprosy notifications
stored on SINAN.
We evaluated the GISTelemed tool employing an approach that was as adherent to [21] as
possible, given the limitations posed by the Brazilian environment where we tested it. This
led us to consider it from two points of view: (a) consistence with an external epidemiological
data source, where we took (leprosy epidemiological data from the Brazilian National
Information System on Reportable Diseases (SINAN) [7] as a reference, and (b) user
perception, where we employed an evaluation instrument from the field of Telemedicine [22].
We then interpreted the results we obtained accordingly to the guidelines given by [21].
Consistency and Representativeness of Data
The analysis of the leprosy cases identified through GISTelemed, when compared to SINAN
shows that GISTelemed identified much less cases. This was expected, since tele-dermatology
is not the only point-of-entry for leprosy cases in the healthcare system as a whole. On the
other side, correlation between data, even if positive but very poor for the whole period
(0.14348), become much better for the periods of 2016 and 2017, when they are taken
separately (0.44495 and 0.37384 respectively). According to the Rule of Thumb for
interpreting the size of a correlation coefficient, values between 0.30 and 0.50 are classified
with low positive correlation and a correlation between 0.00 and 0.30 is classified as
negligible correlation [32]. We obtained similar results with the Bland-Altman plot: a bias of
11.22 shows that the results for SINAN are generally much higher, but the outliers in the
curve comparison lay all in 2015. Both correlation analysis and Bland-Altman plot results
between the SINAN and GISTelemed leprosy-curves are much better for the periods of 2016
and 2017, when tele-dermatoscopy coverage of the State was practically total. This reinforces
an informal visual analysis of these curves, which shows that the curves in figure 4 tend to be
similar in form in 2016 and 2017, even if the GISTelemed curve shows much lower amplitude.
We understand that this indicates that in our State leprosy morbidity in telemedicine is
reflecting a subset of the total morbidity, and that telemedicine-detected occurrences and
overall occurrences tend to follow a similar case occurrence pattern. Since monitoring in
telemedicine, being near-realtime, is much faster than in national notification systems such as
SINAN, where notifications sometimes take months to become online, our results evidentiate
that telemedicine-based epidemiology could be used as a very fast indicator of tendencies and
changes in morbidity patterns and also help identify subit outbreaks. On the other side,
GISTelemed identified 26 cases which were not reported in SINAN, mostly from very small
municipalities. These could indicate a subnotification situation, which with the widespread
use of telemedicine can now automatically be identified in near-realtime. They could also be
old cases, which migrated from some private clinic to the public healthcare system with the
new service offer represented by the public tele-dermatology service.

User perception
Results from our case study show a good evaluation regarding the perceived software quality,
according to measures encompassing “Comfort”, “Efficiency”, “Usability”, “Effectiveness”,
“Operability”, “Performance efficiency”, and “Learnability”.

Some evaluated items did not

perform so well, such as “Accessibility”, “Interoperability”, “Recoverability”, and “Coexistence”.

Considering, however, that most of the responses given for the questionnaire

items were positive, the median calculated for all of the subcharacteristics was 61.9, and that
81.2% of the subcharacteristics have shown a score greater than 50, we can accept a good
perception of quality, usefulness and acceptance of the GISTelemed module by the end users
of the STT/SC information system.
Our perception was that the integration of spatial epidemiology tools to the STT/SC system,
besides enabling visualization of data in maps, allowed users to analyze the evolution of
morbidities and their co-occurrences in quasi-real time.
Threats to validity
We identified the following threats to the validity of the conclusions arrived here:
1. Internal validity: There is a possible selection bias, because we invited only medical
staff, municipal public health officers and public health researchers working directly
with the STT/SC to respond the questionnaire, as they are the direct potential
users. A broader study, involving a larger, external public has yet to be performed.
Another threat related to a selection bias was that some respondents had their first
contact with GISTelemed during the evaluation process, which may have influenced
the answers for some items. To minimize this threat, the options “Not applicable”,
“Don’t know”, and “Don’t understand the item” were included as valid answers.
2. Construction bias: The AdEQUATE evaluation model has not yet been extensively
validated in other contexts; however, we believe that this threat is minimized
because the adopted questionnaire had its items systematically derived from the
ISO/IEC 25010 standard, TAM and SUS, which are largely used methods.
New Features: Real-Time Monitoring of Events
The GISTelemed tool is an ongoing and evolving project and not all features could be
evaluated in this study. In its more recent version, it also allows the real-time monitoring of
events ocurring on the Telemedicine and the Telehealth networks and, more recently, all
pacient referral requests (tratamento fora de domicílio - TFD), as shown in the figure below.
We call this operation mode “Situation Room”. In its present version, this module offers a
fixed pallete of events to be monitored, that can be selected to be watched, as shown in the
figure. Events are organized per originating Primary Healthcare Facility. Last event is shown
in a pop-up window. This module is intended for healthcare policies planning and for realtime monitoring of epidemiological processes.

Conclusions and Future Work
This first edition of the GISTelemed module is still limited: it can research only cardiology,
dermatology and clinical analyses (including infectious diseases) data and the capabilities of
cross-referencing between these three data sources at an individual patient level are also
poor, partially due to the lack of demographic integration of Brazilian public primary
healthcare data. However, this first evaluation of GISTelemed has shown that an interactive
spatial epidemiology tool can consistently be developed directly on top of a telemedicine
infrastructure and be presented to the users as an integral part of this infrastructure. From
both evaluation points of view, consistency and representativeness of data and user
perception the module presented good results and has been considered a useful tool by
healthcare personnel and policymakers in medium and small municipalities in Southern
Brazil.
The utility of such a tool for healthcare policymakers of individual municipalities can be
seen, e.g., on Figure 2.(g) and Figure 2.(h), where the different tendencies of the distribution
of leprosy cases in a municipality can be seen: in Blumenau, Figure 2.(g), leprosy cases
concentrate on the northwestern rural areas of the municipality, whereas on the Santa
Catarina Island, Figure 2.(h), leprosy cases concentrate in downtown Florianópolis,
suggesting different epidemiological mechanisms. The timeline visualization (Figure 3.) is also
usefull to observe morbidities through time. In the video provided with this article, we show

3 different interactions. In the second interaction, we show cases of skin cancer on the tip of
the nose through time: it becomes clear that the municipalities of Blumenau, Joinville
(german settled areas with a predominantly fair-skinned population) and Florianópolis
(fishing industry, watersports, and beaches) not only show a much higher prevalence but also
show a steady number of occurences through time, whereas other regions are much more
variable. This tool is new and there is nothing comparable being offered in the Brazilian
Public Health area, our first validation study, however, has shown that local public health
professionals found it useful and usable.
In 2018 we started to employ GISTelemed for the evaluation of the impact of the Santa
Catarina State Telemedicine initiative and to perform cost analyses [33]. In 2019 we will
start migrating all other areas of the STT/SC (teleradiology, obstetrics, tele-EEG) to
DICOM Structured Reporting findings descriptions based upon controlled vocabularies. A
new patient identification policy has also been introduced. This will allow us to index our
data much better and also to broaden the search capabilities to these examination areas.
