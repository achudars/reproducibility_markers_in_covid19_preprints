ABTRACT
Introduction: Hearing loss is a chronic condition affecting 11 million individuals in the UK.
People with hearing loss regularly experience difficulties interacting in everyday
conversations. These difficulties in communication can result in a person with hearing loss
withdrawing from social situations and becoming isolated. While hearing health loss research
has largely deployed quantitative methods to investigate various aspects of the condition,
qualitative research is becoming more widespread. Grounded theory is a specific qualitative
methodology that has been used to establish novel theories on the experiences of living with
hearing loss.

Method and analysis: The aim of this systematic review is to establish how grounded
theory has been applied to investigate the psychosocial aspects of hearing loss. Methods are
reported according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Metaanalysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015 checklist. Studies included in this review will have
applied grounded theory methodology. For a study to be included, it can apply grounded
theory as an overarching methodology, or have grounded theory methodology embedded
amongst other methodologies. These studies can be in the form of retrospective or
prospective studies, before and after comparison studies, RCTs, non-RCTs, cohort studies,
prospective observational studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, longitudinal
studies, and mixed method studies. Purely quantitative studies, studies that have not applied
grounded theory methodology, articles reporting expert opinions, case reports, practice
guidelines, case series, conference abstracts, and book chapters will be excluded. Studies
included will have adult participants (≥18 years) who are either people with an acquired
hearing loss, their family and friends (communication partners), or audiologists. The quality
of application of grounded theory in each study will be assessed using the Guideline for
Reporting and Evaluating Grounded Theory Research Studies (GUREGT).

Ethics and dissemination: As only secondary data will be used in this systematic review,
ethical approval is not required. No other ethical issues are foreseen. The International
Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (http://www crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO) holds
the registration record of this systematic review. Findings will be disseminated via peer

reviewed publications and at relevant academic conferences. Findings may also be published
in relevant professional and third sector newsletters and magazines as appropriate. Data will
inform future research and guideline development.

Prospero registration number: PROSPERO CRD42019134197

Strengths and limitations of this study:
•

This systematic review is the first to provide a comprehensive critique of the
use of grounded theory to investigate hearing loss.

•

The search strategy was formed in collaboration with an information specialist
at the University of Nottingham.

•

The PRISMA-P guidelines have directed the considerations and layout of this
protocol.

•

Because experiences and articulations of hearing loss are influenced by age,
only adult (≥18 years) participants (people with hearing loss, communication
partners, audiologists) will be considered.

•

The search will not include grey literature.

•

The studies included will only have samples of individuals with hearing loss,
rather than full deafness.

INTRODUCTION
Hearing loss is a chronic condition that involves a decrease in an individual’s ability to hear
sounds. It can occur at mild, moderate, severe, or profound levels, and typically worsens over
time1. Eleven million people in the UK currently live with hearing loss 2,3. This number is
expected to increase to 15.6 million by 20353. Globally, over 900 million people are expected
to acquire a disabling hearing loss by 2050 2,3.

The annual global societal cost of unaddressed hearing loss is $750 billion4. Within the UK,
the annual cost of hearing loss is £30 billion, with the larger proportion of this cost dealing

with the social, psychological, and health impacts of hearing loss, rather than the treatments
provided by audiology services5. Untreated hearing loss can impact the work opportunities
and occupational progression of people with hearing loss (PHL)4. Estimations of the global
occupational limitations occurring due to the stigma and inequalities associated with hearing
loss is $105 billion annually4.

PHL experience functional limitations such as communication difficulties in day to day
conversations, where speech is often misheard and becomes challenging to follow6-8. Failed
instances of communication can lead PHL to experience embarrassment, e.g. if incorrect
responses are given in a conversation after mishearing others9,10. Because PHL struggle to
have full interactions with others they can come to feel isolated and separated from the
world10-12. The anxiousness of repeatedly not being able to hear others can lead to withdrawal
from social situations13. Consequently, it is estimated that PHL are more likely to develop
depression than the general population14-17.

The impact of hearing loss is not only psychological, as it can also impact interpersonal
relationships of PHL also. Not being able to fully communicate and establish successful
interactions can also lead to feelings of frustration18. Individuals that communicate with PHL,
such as their spouses, family and friends, can also become frustrated due to not being heard
or understood in interactions18,19. Conflict in the relationships of PHL and their
communication partners have been reported to occur18,20,21, with hearing loss being a
significant risk factor for the development of abusive relationships22.

Investigations into the experience of hearing loss are crucial to understanding the
implications it has for the person, and the implications it has for their care. To date, most
studies in hearing loss research have used quantitative methods. Due to the evident
psychosocial impacts of hearing loss, there has been a significant increase in the adoption of
qualitative methodologies in hearing loss research23, particularly since the publication of the
“Conducting qualitative research in audiology: A tutorial” in 201224 . Qualitative methods
allow researchers to understand the experiences, opinions and perspectives associated with
hearing loss, which experimental measures are not designed to uncover23-25. Five main

qualitative methodologies exist: phenomenology, ethnography, case studies, narratives, and
grounded theory26. Each of these methodologies aims to uncover the experiences of a
particular sample in different ways, depending on the type of knowledge to be established26.
Grounded theory is the only qualitative methodology that is exclusively used to establish
novel theories completely uninfluenced by previous knowledge26. Grounded theory was first
established by Glaser and Strauss in 196727. It is defined as the systematic exploration of data
in an open-minded, comparative, and rigorous manner for developing a novel theory that is
purely grounded within the data28,29. Through applying grounded theory, people’s
experiences, and occurring social processes can be understood by integrating definitions and
meanings from the perspectives of individuals from the target population30,31. To do this, a
researcher can adopt the principles of one of three grounded theory schools (Table 1).

Assessing the methodological applications of grounded theory is essential for determining the
trustworthiness and credibility of the theories developed, as suggested by researchers in
various fields such as psychology32, nursing33; physiology34,35 and business &
management36. A field that has applied and critiqued applications of grounded theory is
chronic illness research37-40. The founders of all three schools of grounded theory (Table 1)
also specialise in investigating chronic illnesses. Glaser & Strauss initially formed the
methodology to investigate fatal chronic illnesses27,41, but then used it more extensively to
investigate non-fatal chronic conditions38,42,43. Charmaz has since identified the methodology
as the most appropriate for establishing novel knowledge regarding life-long conditions28,38,4345

.

Hearing loss is also a chronic disease as recognised by the World Health Organization46,47,
and is the third most common chronic condition affecting the population48-50. Despite this
none of the aforementioned research into chronic illness reviewing grounded theory included
hearing loss as a condition for consideration. Systematic reviews that have investigated
hearing loss to date have mainly focused on reviewing phenomena related to hearing loss,
such as its impact on interpersonal relationships18, hearing aids and hearing loss51, hearing
loss and alternative listening devices52, treatments for PHL with cognitive impairments53,
hearing loss and auditory training54, vertigo and hearing loss55, quality of life and hearing
loss56 , and hearing loss and depression57.

No systematic review investigating hearing loss has yet assessed the use of qualitative
methodologies to reach these findings, including grounded theory. The current systematic
review will be the first to systematically examine the application of grounded theory
methodology to investigate hearing loss. The review aims to (1) describe how grounded
theory methodology has been applied within the field of hearing loss, (2) critically appraise
the execution of grounded theory methodology in each study, and (3) produce
recommendations for future grounded theory methodological applications related to hearing
loss.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS
The methods and analysis of this systematic review will be reported in accordance to the
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2015

checklist58,59. The recommended items on the PRISMA-P checklist will form the subheadings
of this section. This systematic review will also follow the Cochrane Handbook’s suggested
approach for conducting methodology-based systematic reviews, i.e. SDMO structure
(Studies, Data, Methods, and Outcomes) 60,61. The SDMO is used to investigate contemporary
research methods to illuminate the impact of the methodology on the quality of research
within a specific field60.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
Types of Studies
Studies included in this review will have applied grounded theory methodology. For a study
to be included, it can apply grounded theory as an overarching methodology, or be embedded
into it amongst other methodologies. These studies can be in the form of retrospective or
prospective studies, before and after comparison studies, RCTs, non-RCTs, cohort studies,
prospective observational studies, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, longitudinal
studies, or mixed method studies. Purely quantitative studies, studies that have not applied
grounded theory methodology, articles reporting expert opinions, case reports, practice
guidelines, case series, conference abstracts, and book chapters will be excluded.

Types of Data
Original research submitted to peer-reviewed journals will be the data used in this systematic
review. The data collected in those included studies will include qualitative primary data
occurring in the form of transcripts or quotes from audio interviews with participants, patient
journals, written reflections of patients, family members of PHL, or audiologists, memos of
progression of study, initial themes and analysis, and observational. Records reporting diary
entries of patients before participation in their prospective study, will also be eligible for
inclusion. No secondary data will be collected.

Types of Methods
The methodology under review in this systematic review is qualitative grounded theory
methodology. Different methods such as interviews, observations, and focus groups, can all

be undertaken using grounded theory methodology. Based on the principles of grounded
theory, and the school of grounded theory followed, the most appropriate methods are
selected. The methods used in each study will be identified and discussed.

Types of Outcomes
The explicit use of grounded theory methodology as outlined in the methods section of
studies investigating hearing loss. Where available, specific mentions of the applications of
grounded theory and the type of school followed will be extracted. Studies must also have
researched topics regarding hearing loss with grounded theory methodology, and these topics
will also be extracted and collated.

Settings
Any research setting will be included.

Participants
Participants will include PHL with some residual hearing. Studies involving deaf individuals
with no residual hearing left will be excluded. This is because being deaf entails significant
different experiences to having a hearing loss. Most deaf individuals incorporate being deaf
as part of their identity, and learn sign language at an early stage and become a part of the
deaf community62,63. People with hearing loss on the other hand view their condition as a
disability which limits them in their everyday lives, and are less likely to use sign language or
be a part of the deaf community as they do not share that identity64.
Only studies including adults (≥18 years) will be included. The levels of hearing loss for
eligibility are mild, moderate, severe, or profound, according to the British Society of
Audiology (2018)65. Cochlear implant users, hearing aid users, and non-hearing aid users will
be included. Studies involving communication partners (friends, family members, and
colleagues that interact with PHL) will also be eligible for inclusion. Finally, studies
involving audiologists that are involved in hearing loss treatment will be included. Studies
with children and young adolescents (<18 years) will be excluded, unless they are in a study
with adults where the adult data is reported separately.

Information sources
A systematic search strategy will be employed to identify peer-reviewed journal articles that
meet the eligibility criteria. The following databases will be used: PsycINFO (1800Scurrent), ASSIA (Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, 1987 – current) Global
Health (OvidSP database, 1973- current). Web of Science (1899- current) Pubmed (1996current) British Nursing index (1994- current) CINAHL (Culmative Index to Nursing and
Allied Health Literature, 1961- current) MEDLINE (Ovid, In-process & Other Non-Indexed
Citations, 1946- current) Scopus (1983- current) EBSCO (1944- current). Google Scholar
will be used for forward citation tracking.
Additionally, snowballing of the reference lists of articles shortlisted for inclusion will be
undertaken, and related articles from shortlisted authors will be screened in an attempt to
identify any relevant articles which may not have been returned by the database searches. The
electronic database searches will be updated just before the final analyses and any eligible
studies retrieved will be included. At the end of the study selection process, the search
strategy produced for each database will be reported, in addition to a PRISMA flow diagram.

Search Strategy
The search strategy was formed from free text and controlled vocabularies (Medical Subject
Headings (MeSH)), consultations with an information specialist at the University of
Nottingham, and the testing of search results.

Data management
YA will be responsible for management of the data. A digital record will be kept for all
identified articles, and the process of data screening and extraction will be tracked in
Covidence. A unique ID code will be assigned to the included articles for access to the full
text and data collection sheet.

Selection Process
A review of all titles and abstract resulting from the searches will be performed by YA.
During this screening stage, 20% of titles/abstracts will be independently reviewed by a
second author. Any differences will be resolved by a third author. Full text screening will be
carried out by YA and 20% of full texts will be independently screened by a second author.
Any differences between the two authors will be resolved by a third author. Studies that do
not meet the inclusion criteria will be excluded from the review and the reason for their
exclusion at full text stage will be reported.

Data extraction process
Extracted data will be in the form of direct text collected from the included articles. Data will
be stored in Covidence. Prior to starting data extraction guidance notes will be formed by
YA.

A thematic synthesis approach as established by Braun and Clarke will be used to synthesise
the findings67,68. Through this approach, six steps are undertaken to achieve codes, refine
themes, and synthesise the data. The six stages are: data familiarisation, generation of initial
codes, searching for themes, reviewing themes, refining and defining themes, and reporting
findings. Analysis will firstly consist of coding the data extracted from the included articles
and applying initial codes which are close to the analysed data. This will involve establishing
which aspects of hearing loss were investigated, how they were investigated, the use of
grounded theory, and the grounded theory processes applied within a study. Codes will
subsequently be grouped into more focused themes based on the relevance of each concept.
These descriptive themes will aid in outlining how grounded theory has been used as a
methodology to investigate hearing loss. In the final stage of analysis, analytical codes of the
applications of grounded theory and the implications these have for research when
investigating hearing loss will be established. Recommendations for how to apply grounded
theory when investigating hearing loss will be made.
To ensure inter-rater reliability as required for qualitative rigour69,70, 20% of included articles
will be analysed by a second author. Comparisons of results will be established through
meetings and any disputes will be resolved by a third author.

Subgroup analysis
If indicated, studies that are rated as having low quality according to the GUREGT tool will
be reviewed separately, to establish the issues that should be resolved when applying
grounded theory to investigate hearing loss.

Ethics and dissemination
As only secondary data will be used in this systematic review, no ethical approval is required.
No other ethical issues are foreseen. The International Prospective Register of Systematic
Reviews (http://www crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO) holds the registration record of this
systematic review.
Results from the systematic review will be disseminated via peer reviewed publications and
relevant academic conferences. Findings may also be published in relevant professional and

third sector newsletters and magazines as appropriate. Data will be used to inform future
research and guideline development.

Outcome of systematic review
A comprehensive understanding of how grounded theory has been used in relation to the
study of hearing loss will be identified. Overall, a set of over-arching themes arising from the
body of qualitative research that focused on adults’ experiences of hearing loss will be
established.

Summary
This systematic review will be the first to establish how grounded theory has been used to
investigate hearing loss. A critical appraisal of all hearing loss studies that have investigated
acquired hearing loss within adult populations using grounded theory will be performed. This
novel systematic review will aid in implementing more precise applications of grounded
theory in future research. This will also enable more refined understandings of the
experiences of hearing loss to be established and facilitate better care for those who have
hearing loss.
