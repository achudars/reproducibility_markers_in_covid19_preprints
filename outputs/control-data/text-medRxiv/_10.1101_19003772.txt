Abstract

Background: Attending childcare is related to greater childhood obesity risk, but there
are few long-term follow-up studies. We aimed to examine the associations of
childcare type, duration, and intensity with BMI trajectories from ages 10-42 years.

Methods: The sample comprised 8234 individuals in the 1970 British Cohort Study,
who had data on childcare attendance (no, yes), type (formal, informal), duration (45, 3-3.99, 0-2.99 years old when started), and intensity (1, 2, 3, 4-5 days/week)
reported at age five years and 32563 BMI observations. Multilevel linear spline
models were used to estimate the association of each exposure with the sampleaverage BMI trajectory, with covariate adjustment. A combined duration and intensity
exposure was also examined.

Results: Childcare attendance and type were not strongly related to BMI trajectories.
Among participants who attended childcare 1-2 days a week, those who started
when 3-3.99 years old had a 0.197 (-0.004, 0.399) kg/m2 higher BMI at age 10 years
than those who started when 4-5 years old, and those who started when 0-2.99 years
old had a 0.289 (0.049, 0.529) kg/m2 higher BMI. A similar dose-response pattern for
intensity was observed when holding duration constant. By age 42 years, individuals
who started childcare at age 0-2.99 years and attended 3-5 days/week had a 1.356
kg/m2 (0.637, 2.075) higher BMI than individuals who started at age 4-5 years and
attended 1-2 days/week.

Introduction

Obesity is a major public health problem, accounting for four million deaths globally
and 120 million disability-adjusted life-years in 2015.(1) In the United Kingdom
(UK), approximately 25% of the adulthood population are currently obese, with
40% of men and 30% of women overweight.(2) Even more worrying is that more
recent generations are developing obesity at increasingly younger ages.(3)
Because obesity tracks from childhood to adulthood(4), this means that future rates
of obesity in adulthood are projected to increase.(5)

Childcare settings (e.g., nurseries and playgroups) may offer an ideal opportunity for
population-level interventions and targeted policy changes. Namely because healthy
behaviours and obesogenic trajectories are established early in life(3,6-13) and a
rising number of children attend out-of-home childcare, with many starting as early as
the first year of life and spending much of their week days in these settings.(14-16)
Two recent reviews have summarised the literature on the association between
exposure to childcare, one between ages 0-2 years(17) and one between ages 0-5
years,(18) and obesity risk. Both these publications found that available evidence is
limited to cross-sectional and short-term follow-up studies, with most studies either
revealing no association or a harmful effect. There is some evidence that earlier age
of starting childcare (indicating greater duration of exposure) and higher intensity of
attendance are particularly associated with greater obesity. While certain aspects of
childcare may be related to increased risk for obesity in childhood, we know almost
nothing about how exposure to childcare might be associated with body mass index
(BMI) into and across adulthood. Such knowledge would provide evidence that

targeting childcare policies and practices might ultimately benefit adulthood health
and wellbeing.

We aimed to examine the associations of childcare attendance, and type, age at
start, and intensity among those children who did attend, with BMI trajectories from
10 to 42 years of age in the 1970 British Birth Cohort.

Methods

Study sample
The 1970 British Cohort Study is based on 17198 people born in one week in April
1970 in England, Scotland, and Wales.(19) Data collections have taken place at ages
0 (1970), 5 (1975), 10 (1980), 16 (1986), 26 (1996), 30 (2000), 34 (2004), and 42
(2012) years. The study has received ethical approval and obtained informed
parental and/or participant consent for all data collection. At the most recent sweep,
the 9841 individuals still participating in the study remained broadly representative of
the national population of men and women of the same age.

Starting with the 14875 cohort members who were still participating at age 10 years
(i.e., when BMI was first assessed), 4843 were excluded because of missing
childcare data, 608 because they did not have a single BMI measurement, and 1190
because of missing data on potential confounders. The resulting sample comprised
8234 individuals, representing 55% of the eligible cohort (i.e., N = 14875).

Outcome
Weight and height were measured by community medical officers, health visitors, or
school nurses at ages 10 and 16 years according to standard protocols. At the
adulthood sweeps, weight and height were self-reported in questionnaires (age 26
years) or face-to-face interviews (ages 30, 34, and 42 years). BMI was computed as
weight (kg) / height (m2). In total there were 32563 observations of BMI.
Approximately 65% of the sample had four or more observations (out of a maximum
of six) and approximately 72% of the sample had serial BMI measurements spanning
more than 20 years (out of a maximum of 32 years).

Exposures
At age five years, mothers reported type of childcare setting, age when the
participant started, and how many morning and afternoon sessions per week the
participant attended. Because these data were collected only for the most recent and
previous main childcare placements that lasted for three months or longer, our
exposure variable is limited to the main childcare setting attended by the participant.
The first exposure we computed was attendance: “no” if all placements were coded
as does not attend or “yes” if any placement was coded as does attend. The second
exposure was type: “formal” for nursery school, nursery class attached to a school, or
nursery or “informal” for playgroup. The “informal” classification is restricted to
playgroup because no detailed information on the number of sessions per week and
age at start and finish of other informal care, such as friends or grandparents.
Children reported as attending special education settings, a crèche, or other settings
were removed from the sample due to low numbers. The third exposure was age at
start: “4-5”, “3-3.99”, or “0-2.99” years old when started. The fourth exposure was

intensity: “1 day/week” if attending 1-2 sessions, “2 days/week” for 3-4 sessions, “3
days/week” for 5-6 sessions, or “4-5 days/week” for 7-10 sessions. When the current
placement started after five years of age, or a mother reported that their child did not
attend childcare, or data were missing, we used the information from the most recent
previous placement (with complete data) to derive exposures two to four.

Potential confounders
In addition to sex (female vs male), Father’s occupational class and mother’s age of
leaving full time education were considered as proxies of socio-economic position
(SEP). Father’s occupation, measured when the participant was 10 years old, was
classified according to the Registrar General’s Social Class (I professional, II
managerial and technical, IIIN skilled non-manual, IIIM skilled manual, IV partlyskilled, and V unskilled).(20) Mother’s age at leaving full time education was
ascertained at the birth sweep, and was categorised as ≥ 17 years old, 16 years old,
15 years old, or ≤ 14 years old.

Statistical analyses
Descriptive statistics were produced. Further, in order to understand the
interrelatedness of childcare type, age at start, and intensity, these three categorical
variables were tabulated against each other. Chi-squared tests were used to quantify
the strength of association between any given two variables.

Trajectory modelling
BMI trajectories were modelled in a multilevel general linear regression framework
(measurement occasion at level one and individuals at level two),(21,22)

incorporating systematic differences in the sample-average trajectory according to
the childcare exposures and adjustment for potential confounders.

The time scale was decimal years of age modelled as a linear spline with a single
knot at 26 years of age, thereby producing three easily interpretable parameters: 1)
BMI (kg/m2) at age 10 years, 2) BMI change (kg/m2/year) between ages 10-26 years,
and 3) BMI change (kg/m2/year) between ages 26-42 years. The constant and two
spline terms were allowed to have random effects at level two, with an unstructured
variance-covariance matrix. Further, the level one variance (i.e., error) was allowed
to differ according to whether the data were measured or self-reported. Placing the
knot at the other logical point (i.e., age 30 years) or using more complex functions,
including fractional polynomials, did not result in noticeably better fitting models.

Individual childcare exposures
In the first set of models, each of the four childcare exposures was considered
separately and was included as a main effect and as interactions with the two spline
terms, thereby producing estimates capturing the association of the exposure with
BMI at age 10 years, BMI change between ages 10-26 years, and BMI change
between ages 26-42 years. Sex, father’s occupational class, and mother’s age at
leaving full time education were included in the same way to provide robust
adjustment for these potential confounders. For parsimony, the two SEP variables
were converted and entered into models as ridit scores; associated estimates
capture the difference in BMI between the lowest and highest SEP. The models were
also used to estimate associations of the exposures with BMI at ages 26 and 42

years. No strong evidence of effect modification by SEP was found in stratified
models or in models incorporating exposure-by-SEP interaction terms.

Different childcare age at start and intensity combinations
Because childcare type, age at start, and intensity were related to each other, it was
not prudent to fit a single model that included mutual adjustment for these three
variables. Instead, in the second set of models, the relationships of different age at
start and intensity of childcare combinations with BMI trajectories were investigated
in all children who were reported to attend childcare. The childcare intensity variable
was collapsed and combined with the age at start of childcare variable to create a
new exposure with six responses: 1) 4-5 years old when started and attended 1-2
days/week, 2) 4-5 years old when started and attended 3-5 days/week, 3) 3-3.99
years old when started and attended 1-2 days/week, 4) 3-3.99 years old when
started and attended 3-5 days/week, 5) 0-2.99 years old when started and attended
1-2 days/week, and 6) 0-2.99 years old when started and attended 3-5 days/week.
This exposure was entered into a single model in the same way that each individual
exposure was investigated in the first set of models, with the same set of adjustments
for potential confounders. Again, no strong evidence of effect modification, this time
by childcare type (i.e., informal vs formal), was observed in exploratory analyses.

All procedures were performed in Stata 15 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).
The command runmlwin was used for the multilevel models.(23)

Approximately 85% of the sample reported using childcare, with a preference for
informal over formal childcare (62 vs 38%) (Table 1). Among those who attended any
childcare, the majority (61%) started between 3-4 years of age and the largest
proportion (36%) attended for just one day a week. As shown in Table 2, however,
age at start and intensity differed according to type of childcare, with children in
formal childcare tending to start at a later age and attend more times per week than
children who attended informal childcare. Conversely, those children who started at a
later age tended to go more times per week.

Individual childcare exposures
Table 3 shows the estimated associations of each childcare exposure with BMI
trajectories from 10-42 years of age. Children who attended childcare did not have
higher BMI at age 10 years than those who did not attend childcare (β 0.039 kg/m2;
95% CI -0.103, 0.180), and there was no evidence that this association changed over
follow-up. When childcare was separated into “formal” and “informal” we similarly
found no evidence that these groups had different BMI trajectories compared to
children who did not attend childcare. Results for the age at start exposure did show
that the BMI of participants who started childcare at 0-2.99 years of age was 0.266
kg/m2 (95% CI 0.095, 0.437) higher at 10 years of age than participants who started
childcare at 4-5 years of age. But they subsequently gained less BMI between ages
10-26 years (β -0.013 kg/m2/year; 95% CI -0.032, 0.006) such that effect sizes were
attenuated and null at ages 26 and 42 years. For the intensity exposure, however,
attending childcare 4-5 days a week (compared to 1 day a week) resulted in higher
BMI at age 10 years (β 0.170 kg/m2; 95% CI -0.006, 0.058) and this effect persisted

to age 26 years (β 0.349 kg/m2; 95% CI 0.024, 0.673) and age 42 years (β 0.380
kg/m2; 95% CI -0.066, 0.826).

Different age at start and intensity of childcare combinations
Table 4 shows the estimated associations of different age at start and intensity of
childcare combinations with BMI trajectories. At 10 years of age, there was a clear
dose-response relationship between greater exposure to childcare and increased
BMI. For example, among participants who attended childcare 1-2 days a week,
those who started when 3-3.99 years old had a 0.197 kg/m2 (95%CI -0.004, 0.399)
higher BMI than those who started when 4-5 years old, and those who started when
0-2.99 years old had a 0.289 kg/m2 (95%CI 0.049, 0.529) higher BMI. Similarly, when
holding age at start of childcare constant, estimated effects sizes were always larger
for participants who attended childcare 3-5 days a week compared to those who
attended 1-2 days a week. These results clearly demonstrate that age at start and
intensity of childcare had additive effects on BMI in late childhood. Subsequently, at
ages 26 and 42 years, the effect sizes were not as well ranked according to the level
of exposure to childcare. Nonetheless, even at 42 years of age, individuals with the
highest level of exposure (i.e., 0-2.99 years old when started and attended 3-5
days/week) had a 1.356 kg/m2 (95% CI 0.637, 2.075) higher BMI than individuals
with the lowest level of exposure (i.e., 4-5 years old when started and attended 1-2
days/week).

Using data from a large UK birth cohort study, our results demonstrate a clear doseresponse relationship between starting childcare earlier and attending more
frequently with higher BMI at age 10 years, in line with the findings of the Black et al
systematic review.(18) While this finding is important in and of itself, the real gap in
the literature is that, after childhood, we know almost nothing about how exposure to
childcare might be related to BMI trajectories. The key finding of the present paper is
that greater exposure to childcare resulted in higher estimated BMI up until age 42
years, perhaps with intensity being more deleterious than age at start of childcare
attendance. As such, our paper provides the first evidence that targeting childcare
policies and practices might ultimately benefit adulthood health and wellbeing.

Individuals with the highest level of childcare exposure were estimated to have
between a 0.5-1.5 kg/m2 higher BMI than individuals with the lowest level of exposure
across the studied age range. This effect size corresponds to approximately 0.1-0.3
standard deviations (SDs), which is not negligible given that a BMI reduction of more
than 0.20-0.25 SDs has been proposed to be clinically important.(24)

Previous research in another of the UK nationally-representative studies, the 2000
Millennium Cohort Study, reported that children in informal childcare were more likely
to be overweight at age three years than those cared for by a parent, but this may
have been driven by 75% of informal care in that sample being primarily by
grandparents.(25) Other studies have also reported higher BMI in children cared for
by grandparents.(26,27) Unfortunately, data on care by grandparents was not
collected in the 1970 British Cohort Study. Mothers whose primary source of
childcare was grandparents would have either selected “other” or chosen one of the

13

other options (e.g., playgroup), and this might explain why we found no association
between childcare type and BMI trajectories. The Millennium Cohort Study paper
also found that the relationship of informal childcare with greater overweight risk was
strongest among more advantaged groups (e.g., managerial or professional
background).(25) This might be because, with higher SEP, childcare increasingly
represents a less healthy environment than that found at home. We found no formal
evidence of effect modification by father’s occupational class and mother’s age of
leaving full time education, but this may reflect the lower power in these sub-group
analyses. While the 1970 British Cohort Study offers the opportunity to model
childhood to adulthood BMI trajectories, incorporating effect modification into these
longitudinal models requires three-way interactions and thus a very large sample
size. The Millennium Cohort Study now has data to age 14 years and would allow
detailed investigation with many different outcomes in a contemporaneous sample.

There are only two studies that we are aware of that have investigated the
association of childcare with BMI in adulthood. In a sample of 783 women attending
Cracow or Opole universities in Poland in 2005, Wronka and Pawlinnska-Chmara
found no association of childcare type with BMI at 20-24 years of age.(28) In another
of the UK nationally-representative studies, the 1958 National Child Development
Study, Batty et al found that the BMI at age 44/45 years of individuals who attended
nursery was only 0.01 (-0.05, 0.07) SDs higher compared to individuals who did not
attend nursery.(29) We similarly found no evidence of an association between
childcare attendance or type with BMI at ages 42 years but did find evidence for
childcare intensity. Batty et al also reported no association of nursery attendance with
a range of cardio-metabolic disease risk factor (e.g., blood pressure and cholesterol)

and mortality. Further work, however, needs to investigate the relationships of age at
start and intensity of childcare with these and other outcomes.

The pathways through which childcare experiences may affect the risk of obesity are
poorly understood.(26,30) Different types and characteristics of childcare providers
may have different influences on the development of obesity-related risk factors,
such as physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, diet, and stress.(31-33) For
example, a recent systematic review reported that some childcare staff behaviours
(e.g. providing portable play equipment and positively prompting children to be
active) were associated with increased physical activity in children in cross-sectional
studies.(33) However, this was not seen across all studies. Given the existing
evidence of associations between physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, diet,
and stress with increased adiposity in early childhood,(30,34) it has been
hypothesised that these risk factors are possible pathways through which the
childcare experience may influence the development of obesity.(35) However, the
scarcity of published studies investigating the longitudinal associations of childcare
during the early years and subsequent risk factors such as physical activity and
sedentary behaviour limit the ability to confirm this hypothesis.

The main strengths of the present article are 1) the thorough analysis of longitudinal
BMI data collected on a large cohort over three decades of follow-up and 2) the
ability to investigate multiple aspects of childcare (i.e., attendance, type, age at start,
and intensity). In terms of limitations, 1) childcare in the 1970’s may be very different
from today, although analyses in more recent cohorts have also demonstrated
deleterious consequences for short-term obesity risk,(25) thereby suggesting that our

results may be relevant for contemporary childcare settings, 2) we were unable to
investigate the potential effects of concurrent attendance to multiple childcare
settings because data on age at start and intensity of attendance were only available
for the main childcare setting attended, 3) BMI is only a limited indicator of adiposity
and the reported associations may also reflect greater fat-free mass,(9,36,37) 4)
despite adjustment for father’s occupational class and mother’s age of leaving full
time education, we cannot rule out the possibility of residual confounding by SEP,
and 5) we cannot assess or rule out reverse causality because BMI was not
assessed before age 10 years in this cohort.

In conclusion, our results provide evidence that starting childcare at an earlier age
and attending more frequently have additive effects on increasing BMI which persist
from late-childhood to mid-adulthood. Use of childcare is both necessary and highly
prevalent.(14-16) As such, strategic research is needed to understand what policies
and practices regarding physical activity, sedentary behaviour, and diet exist and are
implemented in these settings, and how these could be changed so that childcare
plays a key role in the establishment of healthy behaviours and weight across the life
course, instead of being associated with a more adverse BMI trajectory.
