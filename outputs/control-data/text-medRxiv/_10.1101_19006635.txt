Abstract
Purpose
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), caused by loss of the ​SMN1​ gene, is a leading cause of early
childhood death. Due to the near identical sequences of ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​, analysis of this
region is challenging. Population-wide SMA screening to quantify the ​SMN1​ copy number (CN)
is recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics.

Methods
We developed a method that accurately identifies the CN of ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​ using genome
sequencing (GS) data by analyzing read depth and eight informative reference genome
differences between ​SMN1/2​.

Results
We characterized S
​ MN1/2​ in 12,747 genomes, identified 1568 samples with ​SMN1​ gains or
losses and 6615 samples with ​SMN2​ gains or losses and calculated a pan-ethnic carrier
frequency of 2%, consistent with previous studies. Additionally, ​99.8% of our ​SMN1 ​and 99.7%
of ​SMN2 ​CN calls agreed with orthogonal methods, with a recall of 100% for SMA and 97.8%
for carriers, and a precision of 100% for both SMA and carriers.

Conclusion
This ​SMN​ copy number caller can be used to identify both carrier and affected status of SMA,
enabling SMA testing to be offered as a comprehensive test in neonatal care and an accurate
carrier screening tool in GS sequencing projects.

Introduction
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorder characterized
by loss of alpha motor neurons, causes severe muscle weakness and atrophy presenting at or
shortly after birth​1,2​. SMA is the leading genetic cause of infant death after cystic fibrosis​3​. The
incidence of SMA is 1 in 6000-10,000 live births, and the carrier frequency is 1:40-80 among
different ethnic groups​4–7​. Four clinical types of SMA are classified based on age of onset and
severity of the disease​1​: very weak infants unable to sit unsupported (Type I), weak sitters but
unable to stand (Type II), ambulant patients with weaker legs than arms (Type III) and adult
onset SMA (Type IV). Early detection of SMA can be critical for long term quality of life due to
the availability of two early treatments, Nusinersen​8​ and Zolgensma​9​, which have received FDA
approval for the amelioration of SMA symptoms.
The disease causing gene, ​SMN1​, together with its paralog ​SMN​2, reside in a ~2Mb region on
5q with a large number of complicated segmental and inverted segmental duplications. ​SMN2​ is
875kb away from ​SMN1​ and is created by an ancestral gene duplication that is unique to the
human lineage​10,11​. The genomic region around ​SMN1/2​ is subject to unequal crossing-over and
gene conversion, resulting in variable copy numbers (CNs) of ​SMN1​ and ​SMN27,12​
​ . Importantly,
SMN2​ has >99.9% sequence identity to ​SMN1​ and one of the base differences,
NM_000344.3:c.840C>T in exon 7, has a critical functional consequence. By interrupting a
splicing enhancer, c.840T promotes skipping of exon 7, resulting in the vast majority of

SMN2​-derived transcripts (70-85%, depending on tissue​13​) being unstable and not fully
functional. Approximately 95% of SMA cases result from biallelic absence of the functional
c.840C nucleotide​14​ caused by either a deletion of ​SMN1​ or gene conversion to ​SMN2​ (c.840T).
In the remaining 5% of SMA cases, patients also have other pathogenic variants in ​SMN115​
​ .
SMN2​ can produce a small amount of functional protein, and the number of ​SMN2​ copies in an
individual modifies the disease severity and is highly correlated with the clinical types described
above​16​.
Due to the high incidence rate and disease severity, population-wide SMA screening is
recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics​17​. The utility of population-wide
carrier screening has been demonstrated in pilot studies​18​. The key to screening for SMA is: 1)
determining the copy number of ​SMN1​ for SMA diagnosis and carrier testing and 2) determining
the copy number of ​SMN2​ for clinical classification and prognosis. Traditionally, SMA testing
and carrier testing are done with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based assays, such as
quantitative PCR (qPCR)​19​, multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)​20,21​ and
digital PCR​12,22​. These methods primarily determine the copy number of ​SMN1​ based on the
c.840C>T site that differs between ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​.
With recent advances in next-generation sequencing (NGS), it is now possible to profile a large
number of genes or even the entire genome at high throughput and in a clinically relevant
timeframe. Driven by these advances, many countries are undertaking large scale population
sequencing efforts​23–25​ wherein testing for rare genetic disorders including carrier status will be
one of the primary drivers. Demonstrating that GS can meet or exceed the performance of
PCR-based SMA tests would indicate that both current and future precision medicine initiatives
could leverage genome data for population-level screening. Replicating the current SMA testing
regime poses a problem for high throughput GS due to the almost perfect sequence identity
between ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​. Furthermore, it is thought that frequent gene conversion between
SMN1​ and ​SMN2​ leads to hybrid genes. These challenges demand an informatics method
specifically designed to overcome the difficulties of this region.
To date, two NGS-based tests for SMA carrier detection have been reported​26,27​. Larson et al.​26
used a Bayesian hierarchical model to calculate the probability that the fraction of
SMN1​-derived reads is equal to or smaller than 1/3 at three base differences between ​SMN1
and ​SMN2​. Since this method does not perform copy number calling, it is not an ideal solution
for carrier screening. Conversely, Feng et al.​27​ developed a copy number caller for both ​SMN1
and ​SMN2​ based on targeted sequencing data that closely mimics the current PCR-based
method. Their method is designed for targeted sequencing and thus requires specialized
normalization that limits their method to one assay at one site. More importantly, the relatively
low depths of GS (~30x) cannot provide reliable bp-resolution CN calls (see Figure S1) and
since this method relies on a single locus, it is not amenable to accurate CN calls with GS.
Precision-medicine initiatives will need a way to diagnose and detect carriers of SMA from GS
data.

Here, we report a novel method that detects the CN of both ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​ using GS data.
While most conventional assays only test for the absence of c.840C as a proxy for the “exon 7
deletion” (either a true deletion or as a product of gene conversion with ​SMN2​), here we
describe a tool that can more fully characterize the variability in the region including: 1) DNA
deletions, including both ​whole gene deletion/duplication and a partial deletion of a region that
includes exons 7 and 8; and 2) small variant detection including the NM_000344.3:c.*3+80T>G
(also referred to as g.27134T>G in literature) SNP that is correlated with “silent” carriers of SMA
(two copies of ​SMN1 ​on the same haplotype)​28​. To demonstrate the accuracy of this method, we
compared CN calls using digital PCR and MLPA with our GS-based calls and showed a
concordance of 99.8% for ​SMN1 ​and 99.7% for ​SMN2​. Additionally, we applied this method to
2504 unrelated samples from the 1000 Genomes Project​29​ (1kGP) and 10,243 unrelated
samples from the NIHR BioResource Project​30​ to report on the population distributions of ​SMN1
and ​SMN2​ copy numbers. The carrier frequencies for SMA using this method agreed with those
reported by previous PCR-based studies​5,6​. In addition to demonstrating the accuracy of our
method to quantify variants in the ​SMN​ region, we also highlight the importance of using
ethnically diverse populations when developing novel informatic methods to resolve difficult
clinically relevant regions of the genome.

Materials and methods
Samples and data processing
Samples validated using digital PCR were procured from the Motor Neuron Diseases Research
Laboratory (Nemours Alfred I. duPont Hospital for Children) collection and were generated from
cell lines as described previously​12,31​. Historical patient samples with known SMA or carrier
status measured by MLPA were obtained from Cambridge University. GS was performed on 73
samples with digital PCR results, 45 samples with MLPA results, and 12,747 population
samples from the 1000 Genomes Project​29​ (1109 of which have MLPA calls), the NIHR
BioResource Rare Diseases project​30​ and the Next Generation Children (NGC) project​32​. The
sequencing and processing of this data was done using a variety of sample preparation
methods, Illumina sequencers, and read aligners. A full description of this data can be found in
the Supplementary Methods.

SMN​ copy number analysis by orthogonal methods

SMN1​ and ​SMN2​ CNs were measured for 73 samples using the QuantStudio 3D Digital PCR
System (Life Technologies) using allele-specific exon 7 probes as described previously​12​. ​SMN1
and ​SMN2​ copy numbers were normalized against those for ​RPPH1​ (​RNase P​). MLPA CN calls
for 1109 of the 1kGP samples were available from Vijzelaar et al.​33​. 45 historical patient
samples were previously tested in a clinically accredited laboratory by MLPA for SMN1/2 exon7
and exon8 copy number (SALSA MLPA P060 SMA Carrier probemix, MRC-Holland).
Additionally, 2 samples from the Next Generation Children project were confirmed using MLPA.

Copy number calling for intact and truncated ​SMN

Two common CNVs involve the ​SMN1 ​and ​SMN2 l​ oci, the whole-gene CNV and a partial gene
deletion of exons 7 and 8 (​SMN2∆7-8)​ 33,34​
​
(see Results). We first count reads that align to either
SMN1​ or ​SMN2.​ Read counts in a 22.2kb region encompassing Exon 1 to Exon 6 are used to
calculate the total ​SMN​ (​SMN1​, ​SMN2​ and ​SMN2∆7-8​) CN, and read counts in the 6.3kb region
including Exon 7 and Exon 8 are used to calculate the CN of intact ​SMN​ (​SMN1​ and ​SMN2)​ .
Read counts are normalized and converted into copy numbers using a one-dimensional mixture
of Gaussian distributions (see Supplementary Information). The copy number of truncated ​SMN
(​SMN2∆7-8)​ is derived by subtracting the intact ​SMN​ CN from total ​SMN​ CN.

Genotyping ​SMN1/2​ copy number using differentiating bases
We call the number of chromosomes carrying the ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​ bases​ ​by combining the
total ​SMN​ CN with the read counts supporting each of the gene-specific bases. At each ​SMN1/2
differentiating base (Table S1), based on the called copy number of intact ​SMN​, the caller
iterates through all possible combinations of ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​ copy numbers and derives the
combination that produces the highest posterior probability for the observed number of ​SMN1
and ​SMN2​ supporting reads. The ​SMN1​ CNs called at single bases are then combined to make
the aggregate ​SMN1​ CN call based on a consensus rule (see Supplementary Methods). In
addition to calling the CN of bases that are specific to either ​SMN1​ or ​SMN2,​ this method can
be applied to variant positions to identify the copy number of bases known to be specific to one
of the two genes, e.g. c.*3+80T>G as described in Results.

Results
Common CNVs involving the ​SMN1​/​2​ loci
While existing PCR- or NGS-based methods focus primarily on the c.840C>T site, ​we adopted a
copy number approach based on the sequencing data from the full genes. ​We examined the
read depth across the ~30kb homologous region harboring ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​ genes in 1kGP
samples (Figure 1A). The depth profile shows that this entire region can be deleted or
duplicated in the population. The exact breakpoints of this CNV are expected to vary from
sample to sample due to the extensive sequence homology within and beyond this region and
can only be resolved in high resolution with long read sequencing. We restricted our CN
analysis to the (~30kb) regions that include the ​SMN​ genes (​SMN1​ or ​SMN2​).

In addition to whole gene CNVs, we also found a 6.3kb partial gene deletion encompassing both
exons 7 and 8 (Figure 1B, Figure S2) that was recently described in another study​34​. The
sequences at the breakpoint are identical between ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2,​ so this deletion occurs at
either chr5: ​70244114 - 70250420 in ​SMN1​ or ​chr5: ​69368689 - 69375000 in ​SMN2​ (Figure S2,
hg19). However, about 500bp downstream from the breakpoint that defines the end of this
deletion there are three base differences between the ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​ loci
(70250881A>69375425C, 70250981A>69375525G, 70250991A>69375535G). Among the
1kGP samples that contain this deletion, we identified 245 read pairs from 237 samples where
one spanned the breakpoint and the mate spanned at least two of the three ​SMN​-differentiating
bases. Analysis of these read pairs revealed that 100% were consistent with the deletion
occurring on the ​SMN2 s​ equence background. We named this truncated form of ​SMN2
“​SMN2∆7-8​”. Since both exons 7 and 8 are deleted, ​SMN2∆7-8​ most likely has limited or no
biological function. Therefore, ​SMN2∆7-8​ is an important variant that any ​SMN​ CN caller should
take into account.
After searching for anomalous read pairs in the 1kGP samples, we did not identify any other
common CNVs in the ​SMN​ region. Combining this information together, we called CNs of the
SMN​ genes to specifically identify the number of intact and truncated forms by dividing the
genes into two regions: the 6.3kb region that includes exons 7-8 and the 22.2kb region that
includes exons 1-6. The CN calculated from the exons 7-8 region provided the number of intact
SMN​ genes. Samples with ​SMN2∆7-8​ have a higher CN call from the exon 1-6 region
compared to the CN call from the exon 7-8 region, and this difference represents the CN of
SMN2∆7-8​. Figure 2 shows the results of this calculation for 12,747 samples where we
identified 2144 instances of ​SMN2∆7-8​ including 140 samples with two copies of ​SMN2∆7-8
and one sample with three copies of ​SMN2∆7-8.​

with the CN calls at the splice variant site (Figure 3A, Figure S3). There was a notable
difference between the concordance of calls in the African and non-African populations (Figure
3A). Excluding the African samples, there were 13 sites that had high (>85%) CN concordance
with the splice variant site. Conversely, for the African samples there were only seven sites that
had high CN concordance with the splice variant site, and the concordance values were lower
than in non-African populations. This is consistent with within-gene variation at many of these
positions in the African population. We selected the splice variant site and the seven positions
that were highly concordant with the splice variant site in both African and non-African
populations to make ​SMN1 ​and ​SMN2​ CN calls based on the consensus of CN calls at the
selected sites (see Supplementary Information for the detailed rules and in-depth analysis on
the variability of the 16 sites).

Validation of the ​SMN ​copy number caller
After developing this method, we tested its accuracy against results from orthogonal methods.
We sequenced 73 samples with known ​SMN1 a
​ nd ​SMN2 ​CNs measured by digital PCR; 45
samples with known results measured by MLPA; and also compared our CN calls with MLPA
calls published by Vijzelaar et al.​33​ on 1109 samples from the 1kGP. This validation data include
64 SMA probands, 45 SMA carriers and 1118 samples with an ​SMN1 C
​ N larger than 1. Our
SMN1​ CN calls agreed with digital PCR results in 99.8% of the samples, the ​SMN2​ CN calls
agreed in 99.7% of the samples, and ​SMN2∆7-8​ calls agreed in 100% of the samples (Table 1,
Table S2). Combined, our recall is 100% for SMA (​SMN1​ CN=0, 64/64), 97.8% for carriers
(​SMN1​ CN=1, 44/45, the one missed carrier does not show read evidence supporting the carrier
status, see below and Supplemental Information), and our precision is 100% for both SMA
(1160/1160) and carriers (1179/1179). We also analyzed the consistency of
SMN1/SMN2​/​SMN2∆7-8​ CN calls in 258 trios from the Next Generation Children project cohort
(see Methods). There is no Mendelian error in any of the calls (Table S3).
Further inspection of the five discrepant samples does not show evidence of errors in our calls
except in one sample (see Supplemental information). The validation for the 73 and 45 samples
was done using two sets of probes targeting Exon 7 and Exon 8 of ​SMN1 ​and ​SMN2​, while the
validation for the 1109 samples used a newer version of the MLPA probemix which includes an
additional 17 probes used to determine the ​SMN1​+​SMN2​ CN in Exon1-6 and Exon7-8, which
helped refine the individual ​SMN1 ​and ​SMN2 C
​ N calls. Correspondingly our concordance is
significantly higher (p-value = 0.009223 for ​SMN1​, 2.651e-05 for ​SMN2​, Fisher’s exact test)
measured against the newer version of MLPA (100% concordance for ​SMN1 ​and ​SMN2​) than
other methods (98.3% for ​SMN1 ​and 95.4% for ​SMN2​).

unrelated samples from the 1kGP and the NIHR BioResource Project (Table S4). We analyzed
the CN distributions by population (Europeans, Africans, East Asians, South Asians and
admixed Americans consisting of ​Colombians, Mexican-Americans, Peruvians and Puerto
Ricans)​. Figure 3B shows the histogram of the number of individuals with different CNs of intact
SMN1​, intact ​SMN2​ and ​SMN2∆7-8.​ The distributions are similar between the 1kGP samples
and the NIHR BioResource samples (Figure S4, Table S5). In general, individuals have more
copies of ​SMN1​ than ​SMN2.​ The most common combinations of ​SMN1/SMN2​ copy number are
2/2 (44.9%) and 2/1 (33.4%). The variability of ​SMN1​ copy number is much lower than that of
SMN2​ copy number in most populations, while the Africans show higher variability in both ​SMN1
and ​SMN2​ CN. Conversely, 54.7% of Africans have three or more copies of ​SMN1,​ which is
more than double what is observed in any of the other four populations (Figure 3B, Table 2).
There is an inverse relationship between the copy number of ​SMN1​ and​ SMN2​ (Figure 3C,
correlation coefficient -0.344, p-value < 2.2e-16). This observation is consistent with a
mechanism where gene conversion occurs between ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​35,36​. The observed higher
SMN1​ CN relative to ​SMN2​ CN could be a result of a bias towards ​SMN2-​ to-​SMN1​ conversion
or selection against a low ​SMN1​ CN. Africans have significantly lower ​SMN2​ CN than the other
populations (Wilcoxon test, p-value < 2.2e-16).
The number of SMA carriers identified across populations is summarized in Table 2 and Table
S6. In 12,683 individuals with confident ​SMN1/SMN2​ CN calls, Europeans have the highest
carrier frequency at 2.2%, followed by admixed Americans (2.05%), South Asians (1.67%) and
East Asians (1.35%). Africans have the lowest carrier frequency (0.44%) by ​SMN1 C
​ N, and this
carrier frequency does not include the 2+0 SMA silent carriers that are more common in
Africans (see “Detection of silent carriers” below). The CN frequency distributions observed in
this study are consistent with previous studies of ​SMN1/SMN2 ​CN distribution in the general
population​5,6​. In addition, we also report the frequency of the exon 7-8 deletion (​SMN2∆7-8)​
across populations. 21.2% of Europeans and 11.5% of admixed Americans have at least one
copy of ​SMN2∆7-8,​ while the frequency is lower in South Asians (3.35%), Africans (1.1%) and
East Asians (0.34%).
In the Next Generation Children project cohort (see Methods), we identified SMA in two
neonatal probands from trio analysis, which were confirmed independently. ​SMN1,​ ​SMN2​ and
SMN2∆7-8​ CNs are phased for each trio member (Figure 3D).

Detection of “silent” carriers
The c.*3+80T>G SNP has been reported to be associated with the 2+0 SMA silent carrier status
where one chromosome carries two copies of ​SMN1​ (either by ​SMN1​ duplication or gene
conversion of ​SMN2​ to ​SMN1)​ and the other chromosome has no copies of ​SMN1​28​. Our
method can also detect the presence of this SNP and thus can be used to screen for potential
silent carriers. In the population samples, this SNP is differentially associated with two-copy and
one-copy ​SMN1​ haplotypes and can be used to identify silent carriers (Table 2). We estimate
the sensitivity improvement (with the biggest improvement from 70.5% to 91.8% in Africans) and

Discussion
Due to the high sequence homology between ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2,​ the ​SMN​ region is difficult to
resolve with both short and long read sequencing and thus far this important region has been
excluded from standard GS analysis. Here, we demonstrate an algorithm that can resolve the
CNs of ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​ independently using short-read GS data, filling in an important gap in
SMA diagnosis and carrier screening for precision medicine initiatives. Accurate measurement
of ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​ CNs is essential not only for the diagnosis of SMA but is also a prognostic

indicator and the basis of therapeutic options​37​. ​SMN2​ CN has been used as a criterion for
many clinical trials for SMA, including Nusinersen​8​ and Zolgensma​9​.
As a demonstration of this algorithm, we made CN calls for ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2​ using sequencing
data from 12,747 samples covering five distinct subpopulations. ​We identified a total of 251
samples with ​SMN1 l​ osses (less than two copies) and 1317 with ​SMN1 ​gains (more than two
copies); 6241 samples with ​SMN2 ​losses and 1274 with ​SMN2 ​gains; 2144 samples carrying
one or more copies of the truncated form ​SMN2∆7-8.​ We cannot quantify the role that deletions,
duplications or gene conversion play to drive the CN changes in this region but we see evidence
supporting all three mechanisms including: 1) 3853 samples with total (​SMN1​+​SMN2​) CN<4
(deletions), 2) 670 samples with total CN>4 (duplications) and 3) a strong inverse correlation
between the ​SMN1 a
​ nd ​SMN2​ CN (gene conversion, Figure 3C). ​Additionally, we identified a
carrier frequency between 1:45 and 1:225 depending on ancestral population (Table 2).
Comparing the CN frequencies by population shows that they are highly different and our
per-population results agree with previous population studies​5,6​. While this provides qualitative
support for the accuracy of our method, we also directly assessed its accuracy by comparing
our CN calls against the results from digital PCR or MLPA. In this direct comparison, 99.8% of
our ​SMN1​ and 99.7% of our ​SMN2​ CN calls agreed with the digital PCR-based or MLPA-based
results. Importantly, our recall is 100% for SMA and 97.8% for carriers, and our precision is
100% for both SMA and carriers.
In this study, we optimized our CN calling to work for individuals of any ancestry and thus limited
SMN1/2​ differentiation to the functionally important splice variant plus seven sites in high
concordance with the splice variant across all populations (Figure 3A). By quantifying the
concordance between all of the reference differences and the splice variant, we were able to
identify variations at these sites that, if not accounted for properly (i.e. removed from our
analysis) could lead to errors in our CN calls. This would be especially problematic in analyzing
Africans because they harbor more diverse haplotypes. Future population genetic studies,
possibly including using long read sequencing, will help profile the haplotypic diversity across
populations more directly and identify new variant sites that could further improve the accuracy
of ​SMN1/​ ​SMN2​ differentiation.
An important area for improvement is the detection of “silent” carriers. One type of “silent” carrier
occurs when an individual has two copies of the ​SMN1​ gene but they are both on the same
haplotype. A SNP (c.*3+80T>G) has been used to identify individuals that are at an increased
risk of being carriers when ​SMN1​ CN is two but the risk associated with this SNP can vary
greatly between studies and populations (Table S7, Table S8). When an individual has just one
copy of ​SMN1​ they can be definitively identified as a carrier, but this variant only indicates a
2-8% chance of being a carrier when ​SMN1​ CN is two (Table S8). With GS, it would be possible
to catalog the different variants that occur with different CN combinations of ​SMN1​ and ​SMN2
and possibly identify additional markers that could be used to improve our ability to identify
these “silent” carriers. In addition, the loss of the c.840C splice variant currently explains around
95% of SMA cases and the remaining cases include other pathogenic variants. These other

pathogenic variants represent another type of “silent” carrier and as more of them are identified,
we will extend this software to directly genotype these as part of the testing process, further
improving the ability to detect SMA carriers and cases.
While there exist difficult regions in the genome where normal GS pipelines do not deliver
variant calls, here we demonstrate the ability to apply GS paired with a targeted informatics
approach to solve one such difficult region. So far, this targeted strategy (GS + specialized
informatics) has been applied successfully to a number of difficult variants, such as repeat
expansions​38​ and CYP2D6​39​. Traditionally, it is not cost effective to perform all of the known
genetic tests and carrier screening on every individual, so candidates for specific genetic testing
are identified using information such as the carrier rate and family history. However, this process
means that many people without a family history who would benefit from knowing their SMA
status do not routinely have access to this data. Once GS analysis can detect all SNVs and
CNVs in all clinically relevant genes accurately then a more general and population-wide
genetic testing strategy will be feasible with a single test. Improving GS to become economical
as a substitute for one current genetic test will help facilitate the integration of more genetic
tests and carrier screens into GS, allowing more general access to genetic testing
population-wide. GS provides a valuable opportunity to assess the entire genome for genetic
variation and the continued development of more targeted informatics solutions for difficult
regions with GS data will help bring the promise of personalized medicine one step closer to a
reality.
