SUMMARY

23
24

Vaccine effectiveness (VE) studies are subject to biases due to depletion of at-risk persons or of

25

highly susceptible persons at different rates from different groups (depletion-of-susceptibles

26

bias), a problem that can also lead to biased estimates of waning effectiveness, including

27

spurious inference of waning when none exists. An alternative study design to identify waning

28

is to study only vaccinated persons, and compare for each day the incidence in persons with

29

earlier or later dates of vaccination. Prior studies suggested under what conditions this

30

alternative would yield correct estimates of waning. Here we define the depletion-of-

31

susceptibles process formally and show mathematically that for influenza vaccine waning

32

studies, a randomized trial or corresponding observational study that compares incidence at a

33

specific calendar time among individuals vaccinated at different times before the influenza

34

season begins will not be vulnerable depletion-of-susceptibles bias in its inference of waning

35

under the null hypothesis that none exists, and will – if waning does actually occur –

36

underestimate the extent of waning. Such a design is thus robust in the sense that a finding of

37

waning in that inference framework reflects actual waning of vaccine-induced immunity. We

38

recommend such a design for future studies of waning, whether observational or randomized.

41

Recent studies of influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE)have suggested that effectiveness declines

42

over the course of one season, i.e., that vaccine efficacy declines as the season progresses[1-3].

43

However, these results have been called into question because inferences of waning may be

44

biased. When there is no waning, some study designs (including the classic test-negative

45

observational design [4, 5] and randomized controlled trials [6-8]) may nonetheless infer

46

waning – measured as a decline in vaccine effectiveness as the season progresses. This biased

47

inference is predicted to occur when the vaccine offers “leaky” protection, reducing the

48

probability of infection on exposure by some proportion less than 100% , and either or both of

49

the following conditions holds and is unaccounted for in the analysis [5]: i) some infections

50

occur unobserved in the study population, such that individuals are infected and (for the

51

season) immune to further infection unbeknownst to the researchers [4, 9]; or ii) heterogeneity

52

in the population exists and is unaccounted for, such that certain persons are at higher risk of

53

becoming exposed or, if they are exposed, of becoming infected upon exposure for reasons

54

other than their vaccine status, for example due to age, history of infection or vaccination, or

55

occupation[6-8].

56
57

If either or both of these conditions hold, then over the course of the season, there will be

58

unobserved reductions in the population at risk (or, for the second, at high risk) in each arm of

59

the trial, and these reductions will be greater in any group that receives less vaccine protection,

60

more moderate in a group that is more protected. In a classic comparison of vaccinated vs.

61

unvaccinated persons, this “depletion of susceptibles” will reduce the pool of susceptible

62

individuals (and especially of highly susceptible individuals) in the unvaccinated group more

63

than in the vaccinated group, reducing the influenza incidence rate in the unvaccinated group

64

relative to the vaccinated group as time progresses; equivalently, the benefit of the vaccine will

65

appear to wane.

66
67

Recently, a novel, cohort variant of the test-negative design, was proposed and implemented

68

that sought to circumvent these sources of bias. This design [10] considered only persons who

69

received influenza vaccine and were subsequently tested for influenza infection. As in the

70

classic TND the vaccine history was compared between those testing positive vs. negative for

71

influenza infection, but unlike a classic TND, the time from vaccination to influenza test was the

72

exposure of interest (as the study was limited to those who had received vaccine and later

73

received a test). Relative VE for individuals vaccinated at different time points was estimated as

74

a function of this interval, by estimating – at a specific calendar time (using conditional logistic

75

regression) the odds ratio between influenza test-positive and test-negative participants, as

76

predicted by time of vaccine receipt and other covariates. Crucial to this method is that

77

individuals with different vaccination dates are compared on a fixed calendar date, rather than

78

(as in the classic TND) comparing individuals with a different vaccination statuses on different

79

calendar dates. The time from exposure (vaccination) to outcome (infection) is thus measured

80

precisely and not conflated with calendar time. That study estimated approximately 16%

81

waning in relative effectiveness of vaccination for each 28 days earlier a person had been

82

vaccinated [10].

84

Peer review and a commentary published alongside the study [11] questioned whether this

85

design had eliminated the potential bias associated with depletion of susceptibles. Subsequent

86

discussions led to reanalysis of the data set with restriction to those who had been vaccinated

87

before influenza season, that is, before infections with influenza could differentially deplete

88

susceptible hosts from different time-of-vaccination groups. The result confirmed the finding of

89

the previous analysis [12]. It was shown heuristically and with simulations that the following

90

was true of the revised analysis: under the null hypothesis that vaccine efficacy did not wane,

91

the study would in expectation be unbiased, estimating that indeed there was no waning, or

92

equivalently that vaccine effectiveness was equal regardless of the time since vaccination.

93

Under the alternative hypothesis that vaccine protection does wane, simulations showed that

94

differential depletion of susceptibles can bias this analysis toward underestimating waning, but

95

not toward overestimating waning and not toward an incorrect finding that VE wanes. By this

96

logic, a study of pre-season vaccinees only that found no waning might be hard to interpret

97

(either truly null, or waning does occur but bias in the design makes it hard to detect), but a

98

finding that waning does occur could not be attributed to these sources of bias.

99
100

It would be ethical and informative to undertake a randomized controlled trial in which persons

101

intending to be vaccinated are randomized to early or late vaccination, on dates anticipated to

102

precede the start of influenza circulation (eg. September 1 vs. October 15) and incidence rates

103

or proportions compared between these two arms, as we have proposed elsewhere [12, 13].

104

Knowing the expected outcomes under various scenarios would facilitate interpretation of such

105

a trial. Meanwhile, it would be valuable to know precisely under what circumstances designs

106

such as the test-negative case-control approach or a cohort-based modification of that

107

approach (as performed in the example described above [10]) would perform in similar ways.

108

For our purposes, a key difference between the classic test-negative case-control design and a

109

prospective observational or randomized cohort design is that the latter designs attempt to

110

track who is at risk for the outcome, for example by censoring people after they have had one

111

influenza test [10] or after they have had one positive test (a typical randomized trial). By

112

contrast, the test-negative case-control design relies on assumptions that the test-negative

113

participants are representative of the population at risk. Because the biases considered in this

114

study come from the unobserved changes in the susceptibility of the at-risk population, these

115

may be subtly different in the different designs, and we consider several different incidence

116

measures below that represent different approaches to tracking who is at risk.

117
118

Here, we consider a hypothetical comparison of two groups of persons, those vaccinated early

119

(group E) and those vaccinated later (group L) with the same vaccine. These might be the two

120

arms of a randomized trial, or might represent an idealized comparison in an observational

121

study. When we compare two groups vaccinated at different times, with the possibility of

122

waning, it becomes interesting to consider how either the earlier vaccinees or the later

123

vaccinees can be subject to greater depletion of susceptibles, and thus the bias in estimating

124

waning can go either way. Specifically, if influenza is circulating between the time when group

125

E is vaccinated and the later time when group L is vaccinated, group L may be more depleted by

126

incidence of infection prior to vaccination in that interval. On the other hand, if vaccine

127

protection in fact wanes, then group E may be less protected than group L on some or all days

128

after both groups have been vaccinated because the protection in group E will have had longer

129

to wane. Thus, in such a scenario – where group L was vaccinated during the influenza season --

130

either group can be get depleted of its susceptibles faster than the other and so the bias may

131

go in either direction. Here we show how this tradeoff occurs, and define a condition under

132

which the bias will overstate waning (group E will look less protected than they are, because

133

susceptibility is more depleted in group L), or will understate waning (group E will look more

134

protected than they are, because their susceptibles are less depleted than group L), or the

135

estimate of waning will be correct. As particular cases, we show that if vaccination of some

136

individuals occurs after influenza season begins, and there is no waning, then the study will

137

erroneously infer waning has occurred as a result of unobserved differential depletion of

138

susceptibles between early- and late-vaccinated participants. If there is waning, the estimated

139

extent of waning may be biased in either direction. On the other hand, if individuals are all

140

vaccinated before influenza season starts (so that there is no risk of infection in any participant

141

before they are vaccinated), and if there is no waning, the study will correctly infer that there is

142

no waning (unbiased estimate). If individuals are all vaccinated before influenza season starts,

143

and there is waning, then the degree of waning will be underestimated (and we cannot rule out

144

an erroneous estimate of increased effectiveness with time since vaccination). These results are

145

summarized in Table 1.

MODEL

151

We consider a cohort split into groups and subgroups as described below, and describe its

152

progress through an influenza season. We define a season as a period with nonzero influenza

153

incidence, that is the period during the year during which 𝜆(𝑡) > 0, where 𝜆(𝑡) is the force of

154

infection with influenza, described more fully below. We denote the start of influenza season as

155

𝑡0 . We assume that within a season it is possible to be infected with influenza at most once due

156

to immunity. We focus on a comparison between groups with two different dates of

157

vaccination, early (𝐸 vaccinated at time 𝑡𝐸 ) and late (𝐿 vaccinated at time 𝑡𝐿 > 𝑡𝐸 ). We

158

consider different scenarios where vaccination of these individuals is complete before (𝑡𝐿 <

159

𝑡0 ), or not complete before (𝑡𝐿 > 𝑡0 ), the start of influenza season. We envision a study in

160

which at some time before influenza season, persons are randomized to be vaccinated early or

161

late, or else choose their vaccination date in a way that is not confounded by predictors of the

162

outcome (test-positive influenza). We focus here on the control of bias from differential

163

depletion of susceptibles. In this study, all participants are vaccinated; the only difference is

164

when. Throughout the analysis we describe expected outcomes, or equivalently outcomes in an

165

arbitrarily large study, neglecting sampling variation; we also neglect all complexities such as

166

loss to follow up, nonadherence, and the like, to focus on the best-case scenario for inference

167

on the existence or nonexistence of waning. Waning is inferred to have occurred by time 𝑡 if the

168

incidence at time 𝑡 is greater in the early than in the late-vaccinated group, or equivalently, the

169

relative efficacy of the vaccine is greater in the late-vaccinated group than in the early. Note

170

that the exact timing when the vaccine began to lose efficacy is not specified; waning may have

171

begun before or during the season, as we infer only that it occurred between vaccination and

172

time 𝑡. Note also that this definition restricts attention to host biological processes by which an

173

individual’s protection from the vaccine on a given day (with the strains circulating then) is less

174

if vaccination occurred longer ago. We define incidence in three alternative ways below,

175

corresponding to three possible targets for estimation in different observational or randomized

176

study designs.

vaccinees respectively).

182

Because we envision a large study with no confounding (by randomization or simply by

183

assumption), the 𝑓𝑖 are the same for both groups (𝐸 and 𝐿). Let 𝑏𝑖 𝜆(𝑡) be the force of infection

184

to unvaccinated individuals still at risk of infection subgroup 𝑖 at time t . We refer to 𝑏𝑖 as the

185

frailty of group 𝑖, and we arrange the groups in decreasing order of frailty so that 𝑏𝑖 > 𝑏𝑖+1 .

186

Without loss of generality, we define 𝑏𝑖 = 1. We allow for the possibility that some persons are

187

completely immune to influenza infection throughout the season and assign them (if they exist)

188

to the lowest-frailty group (group 𝐺𝑁 with a frailty of 𝑏𝑁 =0. Let 𝜗𝐺 (𝑡) be 1 minus vaccine

assume that 𝜗𝐺 (𝑡𝐺 ) = 𝜗𝐺 < 1 and 𝜗𝐺 (𝑡) is nondecreasing with 𝑡 and is constant in the case of

193

no waning. Thus, we assume vaccine is most protective immediately after vaccination, and may

194

wane thereafter. Here we define waning to mean a scenario in which on a particular day, an

195

individual vaccinated longer ago is less protected against infection with the currently circulating

196

strains than had they been vaccinated more recently. We assume that vaccine efficacy, and

197

equivalently 𝜗𝐺 (𝑡), is the same for all subgroups Gi within

infection 𝜆(𝑠) ≥ 0 for 𝑠 > 𝑡0 , and let the early and late groups be vaccinated at times 𝑡𝐸 and 𝑡𝐿

230

respectively. These may be before or after 𝑡0 . We consider various incidence measures at time

231

𝑡1 > max(𝑡𝐿 , 𝑡0 ). Whenever the cumulative hazard for the highest-frailty subgroup, modified

232

by vaccination, by time 𝑡1 in group E is less than in group L, which is equivalent to

DISCUSSION

278

We have formalized and proved in the appendix the claims summarized in Table 1 about the

279

direction of bias when various study designs are employed to assess whether vaccine

280

protection against influenza infection wanes within a season with increasing time since

281

vaccination. If a study compares the incidence of influenza among persons with early vs. late

282

vaccination, and if all vaccinations are completed before the start of influenza season, the

283

design will be unbiased under the null: no waning will be inferred. Under the alternative

15
284

hypothesis that waning does occur, its extent will be underestimated. Therefore, if waning is

285

inferred, the inference that it is occurring is robust, and the true magnitude may be larger than

286

what is inferred. It is theoretically possible that early vaccination could look more protective

287

than late under such a scenario when comparing instantaneous incidence because of the

288

phenomenon of crossing hazards [4, 14], though the practical likelihood of such intense bias

289

may be small. On the other hand, in a design where some vaccinations occur after the start of

290

influenza season, the estimate is biased under the null: if there is no waning of vaccine-induced

291

protection, waning will be inferred spuriously. If there is waning, the direction of bias is not

292

determined.

293
294

The demonstrations of each of our findings for the vaccinee-only design rely on the same

295

principle, applied differently when the timing of vaccination relative to the season is different.

296

The common principle is that a group that has more vaccine-induced protection will retain a

297

higher proportion of susceptible or highly susceptible individuals, while these will be depleted

298

faster in the group with less vaccine-induced protection. The investigators will be unable to

299

track this differential depletion if (1) susceptibility (frailty as we called it in line with other

300

literature) is variable but unmeasured and/or (2) infections are not all ascertained (eg due to

301

some being mild), so the population at risk is less than that thought to be at risk, especially in

302

the less-protected group.

303
304

This common principle is applied in opposite ways in different scenarios, because the late-

305

vaccinated group is more depleted when some influenza incidence occurs before they are

16
306

vaccinated, and the early-vaccinated group is more depleted when protection wanes, making

307

them less protected. In claim 1, we show how these alternative directions of bias balance when

308

both are present, with bias toward less waning if the effect of waning dominates, and bias

309

toward more waning if the depletion of susceptibles from the late-vaccinated group before

310

they received vaccine dominates. In claim 2, we apply this to particular cases and

311

mathematically confirm previous heuristic results – that waning estimates would be null when

312

there is really no waning if vaccination is complete before influenza circulation, that waning

313

would be underestimated if it truly exists and vaccination is complete before influenza

314

circulation, and that waning will be erroneously inferred if it does not exist if vaccination is

315

incomplete at the start of the influenza season. These lead to the recommendation to restrict

316

waning studies to persons vaccinated before influenza season begins.

317
318

Estimation biases occurring due to cohort-selection, differential depletion of susceptibles, or

319

unaccounted-for frailty heterogeneity (three terms for the same phenomenon [4, 6, 8, 9, 14,

320

15]) have been recognized in the literature for some decades[4, 6, 8, 9, 14, 15] but are often

321

not accounted for in study design and analysis. The analysis here contributes two aspects to the

322

discussion. First, it mathematically separates out the effect of heterogeneous frailty (variation

323

in 𝑏𝑖 in our notation, emphasized for example in (in review) and [7, 16]), which leads to the less-

324

protected group being more rapidly depleted of its most frail members and thus looking less at-

325

risk in the aggregate, from the effect of having unobserved infections (more of these in the less

326

protected groups) that deplete the number of persons at any risk differentially from different

327

groups, emphasized for example in [4, 9]. These biases work in the same direction, so that the

16

17
328

biases discussed here arise when either or both are present. The second contribution is to

329

show a general condition under which biases in one direction or the other are dominant in a

330

comparison of persons vaccinated on two dates, depending on which group has been more

331

depleted of susceptibles. The third is to show in general that, as proposed in (manuscript in

332

review), designs that restrict comparison to times of vaccination before the onset of disease

333

exposure are not susceptible to spurious inference of waning. While not applicable in all cases

334

[7], this may be achieved conveniently in highly seasonal diseases where a vaccine can be

335

delivered before transmission begins – such as influenza in temperate climates.

336
337

We note that this analysis considers only the biases that result from susceptible depletion

338

(which can be seen as a form of selection bias [17]). It does not consider other issues of

339

confounding and selection bias that can plague observational studies in this area [18, 19].

340

Therefore, it is notable that these concerns apply even in randomized trials; the reason can be

341

clearly seen, in that the biases occur due to post-randomization differences that arise between

342

the two arms and influence the outcome (incidence). The exact degree of the bias depends on

343

details of the study design, however. We showed that a bias in the same direction occurs for

344

each of three incidence measures. The first (daily rate of reported cases, without reference to a

345

population at risk) would be most relevant to the classic test-negative case-control design,

346

where no explicit cohort is followed (so depletion of susceptibles is entirely unobserved) but

347

rather, incidence of “test-negative” infections is used to assess the population at risk indirectly.

348

The last (rate of reported cases, relative to a population at risk that has been reduced when

349

cases are observed (since by assumption no one can get influenza twice in a season) is most

17

18
350

relevant to a randomized controlled trial or a study similar to that of [10], where a cohort is

351

followed, and persons receiving an influenza diagnosis are removed fro the at-risk group (this

352

particular study also removed those who received an influenza test and were negative, but this

353

does not change the general finding). The middle incidence measure would be a target for

354

estimation in a study where every influenza case would be diagnosed and removed from the at-

355

risk group [9]. We considered this to make explicit that, even if this is accomplished (eg by

356

virologic or serologic testing [9]) the existence of variable frailty will still lead to the bias. Only if

357

frailty is homogeneous and all infections are perfectly ascertained (or if the vaccine is entirely

358

ineffective, perhaps due to a mismatch) does it completely disappear in general [9]. In the

359

special case where there is no waning, however, the design with preseason vaccination only will

360

be unbiased, and if there is waning, the preseason vaccination design will not overestimate its

361

extent. Therefore a finding of waning under that design (as in (under review)), is compelling

362

(unless other important biases are posited), while a failure to detect waning with that design is

363

harder to interpret.

364
365

In summary, we have provided evidence that a small modification to some existing studies of

366

vaccine waning – specifically, restricting consideration to those vaccinated before influenza

367

season -- may be sufficient to make findings of measurable waning very convincing and worthy

368

of consideration in recommendations for the timing of vaccination. We recommend such an

369

approach in future studies, whether experimental or observational.

A. A useful result applied in the main proof

392

Generalized Grönwall inequality

393

Suppose we have two functions 𝑓(𝑡), 𝑔(𝑡) that are solutions to the following ODEs

394
395

𝑓 ′ (𝑡) = 𝑢(𝑡)𝑓(𝑡),

𝑔′ (𝑡) = 𝑣(𝑡)𝑔(𝑡)

396
397

If 𝑓(0) ≥ 𝑔(0) > 0, one also has that 𝑓(𝑡) ≥ 𝑔(𝑡) for 𝑡 > 𝑡0 as long as

In particular, that holds if 𝑢(𝑠) ≥ 𝑣(𝑠).

402

Moreover, the inequality 𝑓(𝑡) ≥ 𝑔(𝑡) is strict if either 𝑓(0) > 𝑔(0) or ∫0 𝑢(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 > ∫0 𝑣(𝑠)𝑑𝑠

Proof: The ODE for 𝑓(𝑡) can be re-written as ⁄𝑓 = 𝑢, which mean 𝑑𝑠 (ln(𝑓(𝑠)) = 𝑢(𝑠).

similarly,

𝑔(𝑡) = 𝑔(𝑡0 )exp(∫0 𝑣(𝑠)𝑑𝑠)

From this the Generalized Gronwall Equality follows.

By eq. 4,

𝜗𝐿 (𝑡1 )𝐵𝐿 (𝑡1 )𝑝𝐿 (𝑡1 )

𝑝𝐸 (𝑡1 ) > 𝑝𝐿 (𝑡1 )

𝐵𝐸 (𝑡1 ) ≥ 𝐵𝐿 (𝑡1 )

(8)

and

421
422

. We prove here that when eq. 6 is true,

Together these demonstrate claim 1a, and eq. 8 alone demonstrates Claim 1b.

Using eq. 3, let 𝑔(𝑡) = 𝑝𝐿𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑓(𝑡) = 𝑝𝐸𝑖 (𝑡), 𝑣(𝑡) = −𝜗𝐿 (𝑡)𝑏𝑖 𝜆(𝑡), 𝑢(𝑡) = −𝜗𝐸 (𝑡)𝑏𝑖 𝜆(𝑡) in the

428

notation of the Generalized Gronwall Inequality. Eq. 9 then satisfies the condition of the

Generalized Gronwall Inequality. This implies that 𝑝𝐸𝑖 (𝑡1 )>𝑝𝐿𝑖 (𝑡1 ), for all 𝑖 and thus by eq. 1 that

430

𝑝𝐸 (𝑡1 ) > 𝑝𝐿 (𝑡1 ). This is eq. 7, QED

431
432
433

Proof of eq. 8 when eq. 6 holds:

434

Assume there are at least two subgroups with different frailties: for subgroups 𝑖 and 𝑗, with 𝑖 <

435

𝑗, we will have 𝑏𝑖 > 𝑏𝑗 . Then eq. 6 implies eq. 9, which implies for these two subgroups:

∫𝑡 1[𝑏𝑖 ϑ𝐸 (𝑠) + 𝑏𝑗 ϑ𝐿 (𝑠)]𝜆(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 > ∫𝑡 1[𝑏𝑖 ϑ𝐿 (𝑠) + 𝑏𝑗 ϑ𝐸 (𝑠)]𝜆(𝑠) 𝑑𝑠

(10)

438
439

Now, to show that 𝐵𝐸 (𝑡1 ) < 𝐵𝐿 (𝑡1 ), we need to prove that at time 𝑡1
∑ 𝑓𝑖 𝑝𝐸𝑖 𝑏𝑖
∑ 𝑓𝑖 𝑝𝐿𝑖 𝑏𝑖
<
∑ 𝑓𝑖 𝑝𝐸𝑖
∑ 𝑓𝑖 𝑝𝐿𝑖

440
441
442

Subtracting the l.h.s. from the r.h.s. we get

444

0<

∑𝑖<𝑗 𝑓𝑖 𝑓𝑗 (𝑏𝑖 − 𝑏𝑗 )(𝑝𝐿𝑖 𝑝𝐸𝑗 − 𝑝𝐿𝑗 𝑝𝐸𝑖 )
∑ 𝑓𝑖 𝑝𝐿𝑖 ∙ ∑ 𝑓𝑖 𝑝𝐸𝑖

445

Recall that we ordered 𝑏𝑘 in the descending order so that 𝑏𝑖 > 𝑏𝑗 when 𝑖 < 𝑗. We need, for 𝑖 <

446

𝑗, and 𝑡 > 𝑡0 to show that

447

𝑗

𝑝𝐿𝑖 𝑝𝐸 > 𝑝𝐿 𝑝𝐸𝑖

23
449

We note that the two sides of eq. 11 are equal at 𝑡 = 𝑡0

450

Differentiating the function 𝑝𝐿𝑖 𝑝𝐸 and using the Generalized Gronwall inequality, we note that

451

this function is a solution to the ODE

𝑗

𝑓 ′ = 𝑢𝑓 = −𝜆(𝑏𝑖 ϑ𝐸 + 𝑏𝑗 ϑ𝐿 )𝑓

452
453

(12)

𝑗

Similarly, the function 𝑝𝐸𝑖 𝑝𝐿 is a solution to the ODE

454
𝑔′ = 𝑣𝑔 = −𝜆(𝑏𝑖 ϑ𝐿 + 𝑏𝑗 ϑ𝐸 )𝑔

456

Thus eq. 8 will hold when

∫𝑡 [𝑏𝑖 ϑ𝐸 (𝑠) + 𝑏𝑗 ϑ𝐿 (𝑠)]𝜆(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 > ∫𝑡 [𝑏𝑖 ϑ𝐿 (𝑠) + 𝑏𝑗 ϑ𝐸 (𝑠)]𝜆(𝑠) 𝑑𝑠 , but this is eq 10, so we have

459

proven that eq. 6 implies eq. 8.

460

Note that the foregoing relied on heterogeneous frailty ((more than one group with different

461

values of 𝑏𝑖 ). When there is one level of frailty (𝑁 = 1, 𝑏1 = 1), 𝐵𝐺 (𝑡) = 1 for all 𝐺, 𝑡.

Proof of claim 2(i): If there is no waning (so that 𝜗𝐸(𝑡) = 1 for 𝑡 > 𝑡𝐿 ) and vaccination is not

481

completed before the start of influenza season (𝑡𝐿 > 𝑡0), then

482

∫𝑡 1 ϑ𝐸 (𝑠) 𝜆(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 < ∫𝑡 1 ϑ𝐿 (𝑠) 𝜆(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 because group E will experience protection (ϑ𝐸 (𝑠) <

1 = ϑ𝐿 (𝑠)) for the time between the start of the season or vaccination in group E (whichever is

In the case of (b), there is equality when frailty is homogeneous, and the inequality is strict

491

when there is heterogeneous frailty (more than one group with different values of 𝑏𝑖 ), as noted

492

in Claim 1(b). In the case of (c), there is equality when ascertainment is perfect and frailty is

493

homogeneous (𝑎 = 𝑁 = 1), and strict inequality otherwise.

494
495

Proof of claim 2(ii) (Top right of Table 1): If vaccination is incomplete at the start of the

496

influenza season and waning occurs, then there will be conflicting biases due to depletion of

497

susceptibles. Rearranging eq. 6 we have:

498

∫𝑡 1[ϑ𝐸 (𝑠) − ϑ𝐿 (𝑠)] 𝜆(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 = ∫𝑡 𝐿 [ϑ𝐸 (𝑠) − ϑ𝐿 (𝑠)] 𝜆(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 + ∫𝑡 1[ϑ𝐸 (𝑠) − ϑ𝐿 (𝑠)] 𝜆(𝑠)𝑑𝑠

499

where the first integral on the right is negative due to earlier vaccination of group E, and the

500

second integral is positive due to waning. The balance determines whether the extent of

501

waning will be overestimated or underestimated.

Proof of claim 2 (iii) (bottom row of Table 1): If vaccination is completed before influenza

504

season begins (𝑡𝐸 < 𝑡𝐿 < 𝑡0 ), then the following inequalities will hold, with waning

505

underestimated when it exists and correctly estimated as null when it does not. This comes

506

from an application of Claim 1, with the sign reversed (if there is waning) or equality (if there is

507

no waning). If vaccination is complete before influenza season, then the only source of

508

differences in ∫𝑡 1 ϑ𝐺 (𝑠) 𝜆(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 is waning; otherwise the cumulative vaccine-adjusted incidence

509

will be equal between groups throughout the study, which will give ∫𝑡 1 ϑ𝐸 (𝑠) 𝜆(𝑠)𝑑𝑠 >

510

1
∫𝑡 ϑ𝐿 (𝑠) 𝜆(𝑠)𝑑𝑠. Therefore the condition of Claim 1 is satisfied (with the inequality reversed) if
