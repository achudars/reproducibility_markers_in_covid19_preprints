What is already known on this topic
•

Among Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized for heart failure, mortality in the 30day post-discharge period has been increasing over the past several years.
However, the relationship between post-discharge acute care and mortality in the
early post-discharge period remains poorly understood.

•

Observation units and the emergency departments (ED) have increasingly been
used as avenues for patient care in the United States. However, the utilization of
these services in the early post-discharge period for conditions targeted in the
Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP), and the outcomes of
patients in these settings, is required to appropriately evaluate the effects of the
program.

What this study adds
•

Among conditions targeted in the HRRP, patients with heart failure, but not those
with acute myocardial infarction or pneumonia, experienced increase in postdischarge 30-day mortality. This increase preceded the announcement of the
program and was concentrated among individuals who sought no post-discharge
acute care, nearly half of whom had been discharged to hospice.

•

Despite increasing utilization of observation units and the ED in the postdischarge period, care in these settings was not associated with increased
mortality risk.

ABSTRACT
Background: With incentives to reduce readmission rates in the United States, there
are concerns that patients who need hospitalization after a recent hospital discharge
may be denied access, which would increase their risk of mortality.
Objective: We determined whether patients with hospitalizations for conditions covered
by national readmission programs who received care in emergency department (ED) or
observation units but were not hospitalized within 30 days had an increased risk of
death. We also evaluated temporal trends in post-discharge acute care utilization in
inpatient units, emergency department (ED) and observation units for these patients.
Design, Setting, and Participants: In this observational study of national Medicare
claims data for 2008-2016, we identified patients ≥65 years hospitalized with heart
failure (HF), acute myocardial infarction (AMI), or pneumonia, conditions included in the
HRRP.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Post-discharge 30-day mortality according to patients’
30-day acute care utilization. Acute care utilization in inpatient and observation units,
and the ED during the 30-day and 31-90-day post-discharge period.
Results: There were 3,772,924 hospitalizations for HF, 1,570,113 for AMI, and
3,131,162 for pneumonia. The overall post-discharge 30-day mortality was 8.7% for HF,
7.3% for AMI, and 8.4% for pneumonia. Risk-adjusted mortality increased annually by
0.05% (95% CI, 0.02% to 0.08%) for HF, decreased by 0.06% (95% CI, -0.09% to 0.04%) for AMI, and did not significantly change for pneumonia. Specifically, mortality
increased for HF patients who did not utilize any post-discharge acute care, increasing
at a rate of 0.08% per year (95% CI, 0.05% to 0.12%), exceeding the overall absolute

annual increase in post-discharge mortality in heart failure, without an increase in
mortality in observation units or the ED. Concurrent with a reduction in 30-day
readmission rates, 30-day observation stays and visits to the ED increased across all 3
conditions during and beyond the post-discharge 30-day period. There was no
significant change in overall 30-day post-acute care utilization.
Conclusions: The only condition with an increasing mortality through the study period
was HF; the increase preceded the policy and was not present among those received
ED or observation unit care without hospitalization. Overall, during this period, there
was not a significant change in the overall 30-day post-discharge acute care utilization.

BACKGROUND
The announcement and implementation of the United States Hospital
Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP) were associated with a reduction in
readmissions within 30 days of discharge for heart failure, acute myocardial infarction
(AMI), and pneumonia,(1-4) as demonstrated by a decrease in the overall national rate
of readmissions. There are concerns that pressures to reduce readmissions have led to
the evolution of care patterns that may have adverse consequences through reducing
access to care in appropriate settings.(5-7) Therefore, it is essential to determine
whether patients who are seen in acute care settings, but not hospitalized, experienced
an increased risk of mortality.
There is also a question about the association of the HRRP with the overall use
of acute services in the 30-day window. The reduction in readmissions could have
occurred in the setting of changes that improved the recovery of patients and reduced
the occurrence of clinical events requiring acute care in the early post-discharge period.
Alternatively, the decrease in readmissions might not have reduced the need for acute
care but instead influenced clinicians to direct patients to the emergency department
(ED) or observation units instead of pursuing hospital admission. The care of patients in
the ED and observation units is appropriate only if they can be treated adequately in
these settings without pursuing admission. An assessment of how outcomes of patients
in these care settings has evolved is essential to address concerns regarding the
appropriateness of changes in patterns of acute care in the post-discharge period
during the application of incentives to reduce readmission.

Accordingly, we determined if the patients who sought acute care in the 30 days
after discharge for heart failure, AMI, and pneumonia, the conditions the US Congress
included in the HRRP(3, 8, 9), but did not undergo hospitalization, had an increased risk
of mortality. In particular, we investigated if people who had a post-discharge
emergency department visit that did not lead to a hospitalization had an increase in
mortality, addressing whether the incentive programs reduced access to the hospital
and caused harm. We examined the characteristics of patients, and the change over
time, by their type of acute care in the 30 days after hospitalization.
We also evaluated the temporal trends in the utilization of post-discharge acute
care, including readmissions, observation stays and ED visits. We determined if
declines in readmissions were associated with increases in other types of acute care.
We tested if there were differences over time in 30-day need for acute care. We also
evaluated the period from day 31 through day 90 to determine if there was a difference
after the evaluation period of HRRP, to see if any practice change was limited to the
period covered by the incentives.

METHODS
Data Source
We used the Medicare Standard Analytic Files that included 100% inpatient and
outpatient claims for the years 2008–2016. The study period spanned the
announcement and subsequent implementation of the HRRP in 2010 and 2012,
respectively.(8) For each year, we included data for all fee-for-service Medicare
beneficiary 65 years of age and older who were hospitalized with a principal discharge

diagnosis of heart failure, AMI, or pneumonia. The diagnoses were based on
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) diagnosis codes that are included in the
CMS measures for these conditions and are publicly available.(10-13) Notably, the
measure for pneumonia changed in 2014, but to ensure consistency, the study
population for pneumonia was defined across the study period using the codes before
the measure changed.(12) Further, the coding scheme changed from ICD-9 to ICD-10
in October 2015.(14) Therefore, we used the CMS measure methodology that was
rigorously tested for consistency in the patient population for each of 3 conditions
across transition.(10)
To align the study cohort with the population of patients under the purview of the
HRRP, we excluded individuals who were discharged against medical advice, died
during hospitalization, and did not have at least 30-day follow-up after discharge. The
cohort was consistent with the specifications of the 30-day readmission metric of the
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.(9, 11-13, 15)

Post-discharge Acute Care Utilization and Mortality
We used revenue center codes specific to claims submitted from observation stays and
ED visits to identify these care settings. These included revenue center codes of 0762
and/or Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System code of G0378 for observation
stays and revenue center codes of 0450, 0451, 0452, 0459, or 0981 for ED visits based
on hospital outpatient claims data. These have been used in a National Quality Forumendorsed outcome measure focused on post-discharge acute care.(16) We used the
Medicare denominator files to identify patients who died from any cause and determined

the temporal relationship of their date of death to the day of hospital discharge.(17) We
defined 30-day post-discharge mortality as the proportion of individuals discharged alive
after hospital discharge who died within 30-days of discharge.

Post-discharge Care-based Patient Groups
We examined post-discharge mortality in 4 mutually exclusive patient groups that
were defined based on the clinical setting of post-discharge care availed by patients in
the post-discharge period. These included patients that (1) were readmitted to the
hospital within 30 days of discharge for any cause, (2) were not readmitted but had an
observation stay in the 30-day post-discharge period for any cause, (3) were neither
readmitted nor had an observation stay, but visited the ED for any reason, and (4) had
no post-discharge 30-day acute care either as a hospitalization, observation stay, or ED
visit.

Risk-Adjusted Rates of Outcomes
To account for changes in patient characteristics, we constructed logistic regression
models with utilization of care and mortality endpoints across care settings as
dependent variables and covariates included in the risk-adjustment models in the CMS
measures for each condition as independent variables (eTables 1-3). The calendar-year
and monthly risk-adjusted rates of utilization and mortality are calculated as the ratio of
the observed rate during the period and the expected rate in the period, multiplied by
the unadjusted rate over the study period.(9) To ensure consistency in covariates
across ICD-9 and ICD-10 coding formats, as a part of the CMS measure design

process, combinations of codes within each of the coding schemes were mapped to
Condition Category (CC) codes for the covariates included in the model. The ICD-9 and
ICD-10 codes included in the CC codes, and data assessments showing consistency of
CC codes across the transition, are publicly available.(10)
There have been changes in the number of codes on inpatient claims over
time.(18, 19) We pursued additional analyses to evaluate whether differences in
covariate selection strategies substantively altered the results. First, we used inpatient
and outpatient claims over the preceding 12-month period to assess covariates. We
found that restricting the additional inpatient covariates available from the expansion of
codes to the same number available previously did not substantively alter the riskadjustment models..(20) Nevertheless, to specifically address how the strategy to
identify covariates affects risk-adjusted assessments in the current analysis, we created
a secondary cohort of hospitalizations with complete information on the order of
inpatient claims (95% of the primary cohort), and used two covariate identification
strategies, where we combined outpatient claims over the preceding 12 months before
the index hospitalization with (a) a fixed number of diagnoses from the claims across
study period (9 secondary diagnosis codes, 6 procedure codes), or (b) all inpatient
codes (i.e. up to 25 diagnosis and procedure codes after expansion of inpatient code
slots).

Statistical Analysis
First, we evaluated calendar-year and monthly rates of post-discharge care
within the 30-day post-discharge period as readmissions, observation stays, and ED

visits between 2008 and 2016 for each of the 3 HRRP conditions. Next, for each of the
3 HRRP conditions, we evaluated the average annual change in rates of care utilization
across different care settings, based on ordinary least squares regression of rates of
post-discharge care use—rates of readmissions, observation stays, ED visits, or care in
either of 3 acute care settings—against calendar years. We used the non-parametric
runs test to evaluate and confirm the linearity of calendar-year trends, which evaluates
the randomness of distribution of data points around the regression line (see Online
Supplement).(21) To better understand whether changes in patterns of care in a given
post-acute care setting had progressed differently during the 30 days after discharge,
we qualitatively evaluated care trends in these settings during post-discharge days 0-30
and 31-90 and whether there was an interaction between calendar year (2008-2016)
and post-discharge period (day 0-30 versus 31-90) in analysis of covariance.
Next, we evaluated calendar-year and monthly trends in post-discharge 30-day
mortality across the 4 patient groups, based on whether patients were readmitted, had
an observation stay only, had an ED visit only, or had no care in any of these settings.
We noted that these calendar-year trends were linear over the course of the study
period based on visual assessment and using the runs test. We also confirmed
normality of residuals and homoscedasticity of data, to ensure that assumptions of
linear regression models were satisfied. We used an interaction term for post-discharge
care group and calendar year in an analysis of covariance model to evaluate whether
calendar-year trends in mortality were significantly different across the patient groups.
We evaluated average annual changes in mortality rates across care settings, reported
as the coefficient of change of the respective outcome in an ordinary least square

regression with calendar year as a continuous independent variable. To evaluate the
contribution of changes in mortality across individual care settings to the overall
changes in mortality in the post-discharge 30-day period, we calculated the proportion
of annual change in overall mortality rates that occurred across the 3 settings.
Next, to specifically address the possible associations with the announcement
and implementation of HRRP with changing utilization across care settings, we
constructed interrupted time series models, assessing how slope of the temporal trends
in monthly rates of post-discharge care in the 3 acute care settings changed with the
announcement and implementation of the HRRP. These analyses are consistent with
the approach outlined in prior studies.(1, 9, 22)
Further, to evaluate whether systematic differences in patient characteristics
were driving differences in outcomes, we evaluated differences in comorbidities and inhospital events such as operative procedures and complications, as well as discharge
disposition across these groups. We specifically evaluated whether comorbidities that
are markers of debility, such as dementia, delirium, and encephalopathy, pressure
ulceration, and protein calorie malnutrition, varied across groups. The comorbidities
were ascertained from all claims across inpatient and outpatient care settings in the 1year preceding the index hospitalization. The issues in the expansion of inpatient codes
during this study period are mitigated with the use of comprehensive inpatient and
outpatient codes. Finally, we assessed for markers for end-of-life care at discharge,
including consultations for palliative care and discharge from hospital to hospice
facilities.

All other analyses were performed using SAS, version 9.4 (Cary, NC), and Stata
14 (College Station, TX). The level of significance was set at 0.05. The study was
reviewed by the Yale University Institutional Review Board and deemed exempt from
informed consent due to the deidentified data. The study was reported in accordance
with the STrengthening the Reporting of OBservational studies in Epidemiology
(STROBE) recommendations, and its checklist is included in the online supplement.

Patient involvement and Dissemination
No patients were involved in the development of the research question or the outcome
measures, or in developing plans for the design and implementation of the study. The
data are de-identified and, therefore, cannot be shared with the study participants
directly. We will enlist patient and public participation in the dissemination of the results
of the study.

RESULTS
There were 3,772,924 hospitalizations for heart failure, 1,570,113 for AMI, and
3,131,162 for pneumonia during the study period. Of these, 22.5% patients with heart
failure, 17.5% with AMI, and 17.2% with pneumonia were readmitted within 30 days of
discharge. The overall rate of observation stays and ED visits were 1.7% and 6.4% for
heart failure, 2.6% and 6.8% for AMI, and 1.4% and 6.3% for pneumonia, respectively.
Cumulatively, a third of all hospitalizations—30.7% for heart failure, 26.9% for AMI, and
24.8% for pneumonia—received post-discharge care in any acute-care setting.

Trends in Post-discharge Acute Care
The 30-day observed readmission rates decreased for all 3 conditions, from
23.5% in 2008 to 21.7% in 2016 for heart failure, 19.0% in 2008 to 15.9% in 2016 for
AMI, and 17.6% in 2008 to 16.4% in 2016 for pneumonia (eFigure 1). Risk-adjusted
rates followed a similar pattern, with a decrease from 24.5% to 21.0% for heart failure,
19.0% to 16.1% for AMI and 18.3% to 16.2% for pneumonia (eFigure 2). On average,
risk-adjusted readmission rates decreased by 0.51% (95% CI, -0.66% to -0.35%) per
year for heart failure, 0.44% (-0.56% to -0.32%) per year for AMI, and 0.33% (-0.43% to
-0.23%) per year for pneumonia (Figure 1).
There was an increase in post-discharge 30-day observation stays and ED visits
across the 3 conditions, with an average annual increase in risk-adjusted rates of
observation stays of 0.13% (0.11% to 0.15%) for heart failure, 0.23% (0.19% to 0.26%)
for AMI, and 0.11% (0.10% to 0.12%) for pneumonia among those not readmitted
(P<0.001 for all). Similarly, there was a smaller but significant increase in rates of postdischarge 30-day ED visits for all 3 conditions, with an average annual increase of
0.04% (0.01% to 0.07%) for heart failure, 0.14% (0.09% to 0.19%) for AMI, and 0.06%
(0.02% to 0.10%) for pneumonia (P<.001 for all) (Figure 1). While the combination of
the increase in ED and observation stays was less than the decrease in readmission,
the overall change in post-discharge acute care was not significant.
The increase in post-discharge observation stays and ED visits was also
observed during days 31-90 post-discharge (Figure 2, eFigure 3). There was no
significant difference between the increase in risk-adjusted rates of observation stays
during post-discharge days 0-30 and 31-90, across calendar years for heart failure (P =

0.62) or pneumonia (P = 0.50). For AMI, the post-discharge observation stays increased
in both periods, but at a higher rate during days 0-30 than days 31-90 (P for differences
in slopes = 0.005). Similarly, ED visits increased during the first 30 days post-discharge
as well as in the 31-90-day period, with a larger relative increase in the early postdischarge period across for heart failure and AMI (P for differences in slopes for HF,
0.02, and AMI, 0.003), but not for pneumonia (P = 0.13).
In interrupted time series models for both unadjusted and risk-adjusted
assessments, monthly rates of post-discharge readmission rates decreased
substantially at HRRP announcement across the 3 conditions (P for slope change,
<0.001, Figure 3, eFigures 3-8, and eTable 4-9), and continued to decrease at a slower
rate after HRRP’s implementation. The rates of observation stays were increasing
before HRRP for all conditions. They accelerated after HRRP was announced, across
both unadjusted and risk-adjustment assessments for heart failure. For AMI and
pneumonia, while unadjusted observation rates did not demonstrate an inflection,
conservative risk-adjustment assessments suggest an increase in observation stays
that was approximately a fourth of the decrease in corresponding readmission rates (P
for slope change <0.05, eTables 8 and 9). Across all 3 conditions, there were no
inflection in rates of ED visits after HRRP announcement, but there was a significant
increase after HRRP implementation that was approximately a fourth of the decrease in
readmissions during this period (P for slope-change <0.05).

The overall post-discharge 30-day mortality was 8.7% for heart failure, 7.3% for
AMI, and 8.4% for pneumonia. Post-discharge 30-day mortality was higher in those with
readmissions (13.2% in heart failure, 12.7% for AMI, and 15.3% for pneumonia),
compared with patients with observation stays (4.5% in heart failure, 2.7% for AMI, and
4.6% for pneumonia), or ED visits (9.7% in heart failure, 8.8% for AMI, and 7.8% for
pneumonia), or no post-discharge acute care (7.2% in heart failure, 6.0% for AMI, and
6.9% for pneumonia).
Cumulatively, a third of post-discharge deaths occurred in individuals who were
readmitted within the 30-day period (eFigure 9). Among those not readmitted, most
deaths within the post-discharge 30-day period occurred in individuals who had neither
observation stays nor ED visits, which represented more than 60% of the overall postdischarge 30-day mortality across the conditions. Those who were not readmitted but
who received care in observation units or the ED represented less than 10% of all
deaths in the post-discharge period (eFigure 9).
Over the study period, risk-adjusted post-discharge mortality increased from
8.4% to 8.8% for heart failure, decreased from 7.5% to 7.0% for AMI, and 8.3% to 8.1%
pneumonia (Figure 4). The increase in post-discharge mortality for heart failure began
before the announcement of the HRRP. The average risk-adjusted post-discharge 30day mortality increased by 0.05% (95% CI, 0.02% to 0.08%) per year for heart failure
and decreased by 0.06% (-0.09% to -0.04%) per year for AMI during 2008-2016 (Figure
5). Of the overall increase in mortality in heart failure, increase in mortality was
concentrated among individuals who were neither readmitted nor received care in an
observation unit or an ED (Figure 5). The rate of increase in mortality in this group

per year (95% CI, 0.05% to 0.12%), rates of increase that exceeded the overall increase
in post-discharge mortality in heart failure. In contrast, decrease in post-discharge
mortality in AMI was concentrated among those that were readmitted. For pneumonia,
the overall mortality rates did not change over the study period. Therefore, increase in
post-discharge mortality were limited to patients with heart failure, who did not receive
post-discharge acute care in of the 3 settings.
There were no effects of HRRP announcement or implementation on temporal
trends in mortality among patients receiving post-discharge acute care in observation
units or the ED. Specifically, in interrupted time series models that evaluated for the
effects of mortality, across all 3 conditions and for unadjusted as well as risk-adjusted
assessments, there were no HRRP associated inflections in mortality in these settings
at either the announcement of the HRRP or its implementation (Figure 6, eFigures 1217, eTables 10-15). This suggests that the HRRP was not associated with an increase
in mortality risk among patients receiving care in the observation units or the ED in the
post-discharge period.

Characteristics of Patients by Post-discharge Care Setting and Outcomes
There were differences in markers of frailty and advanced health care needs
between groups based on whether they survived to post-discharge day 30 or died after
seeking post-discharge care in various settings (Tables 1-3, eTables 16-18). Across all
conditions, those who died had a higher prevalence of markers of debility including
dementia, functional disability, delirium, chronic skin ulceration, and protein calorie

malnutrition. Among the deceased, the prevalence rates of these conditions were
substantially higher in the group of patients who died without having used any postdischarge acute care (Tables 1-3). Those that died also had a higher rate of markers of
advanced disease such as cardiorespiratory failure, metastatic cancer, and acute
leukemia; however, these markers did not differ between groups based on their postdischarge care use. Further, the group of patients without post-discharge acute care
use had much higher rates of palliative care consultations and discharge to hospice. In
the group of patients who died without using post-discharge acute care, 19.4% with
heart failure, 21.0% with AMI, and 17.0% with pneumonia had a palliative care
consultation before discharge. Notably, while 3.6% patients with heart failure, 3.2%
patients with AMI and 3.1% patients were discharged to hospice following index
hospitalization, in patients who died without using post-discharge acute care, 45.3%
with heart failure, 49.1% with AMI, and 42.0% with pneumonia had been discharged to
hospice after the index hospitalization.
There were also disease-specific temporal trends in hospice discharges. Across
all patients, 3.6% with heart failure, 3.2% with AMI, and 3.2% with pneumonia were
discharged to hospice, with an increase in hospice discharges in heart failure and
pneumonia but not in AMI (Figure 7).

DISCUSSION
Between 2008 and 2016, while the national readmission rate decreased significantly
across all 3 conditions included in the HRRP, the use of the ED and observation units
significantly increased. Although the readmission rate decline was greater than the rise

in the other acute care settings, the overall post-discharge acute care change,
representing the aggregate of readmission, observation stays and ED visits, did not
significantly change. Patients receiving post-discharge care in the ED and observation
units who were not readmitted had lower mortality than those who were readmitted. A
majority of deaths in the 30-day post-discharge period occurred in patients who did not
seek any post-discharge acute care, with fewer than 10% occurring in those with postdischarge care in observation units and the ED. During this period, which spanned
before the HRRP through the announcement and implementation, only patients with
heart failure had a significant increase in post-discharge mortality, which began before
the HRRP announcement. The increase, however, was almost exclusively observed
among those without post-discharge acute care and was not a result of deaths among
those with ED or observation stays who were not admitted. Nearly half of all patients
who died without any post-discharge acute care had been discharged to hospice from
the index hospitalization.

Trends in Post-discharge Observation Stays and ED visits
Observation stays and ED visits have increasingly been used in the post-discharge
period.(1) We find that the rise in the care in these settings counterbalances
improvements in readmissions during 2008-2016, expanding on a similar observation
analysis using Medicare data from 2012-2015.(23) Collectively, the patterns suggest a
transition in how patients receive post-discharge acute care. The MedPAC, a nonpartisan organization that does analyses for the US Congress, evaluated the HRRP and
similarly found reductions in readmissions with increases in ED and observation

visits.(24) Notably, we found an increase in these care settings that was not restricted to
the 30-day measure reporting period, and increased at a similar rate during days 31-90
post-discharge. The MedPAC, in addition, also found that observation stays and ED
visits occurred among conditions that were not targeted in the HRRP.(24) Therefore, it
is unclear whether the changing patterns of post-discharge acute care was part of a
strategy to reduce readmission or whether they are related to other concurrent policy
changes such as the wider implementation of criteria for inpatient hospitalizations that
discouraged short hospital stays as inpatient hospitalizations.(3, 25, 26) Nevertheless,
the overall rise in alternative post-discharge acute care in the 30-day period requires an
assessment of whether patients experience improved with this transition, and if there
are avenues to further improve their post-discharge care recovery.

Outcomes in Observation Stays and ED visits
We found that patients that received care solely in observation units and ED had lower
rates of mortality than those who were hospitalized, indicating that these settings were
likely utilized for lower risk patients. Thus, the result does not support the concern that
high-risk patients are denied access to the higher-level services they need.(5, 6) The
changes in mortality—especially for patients with heart failure, who have experienced
rising post-discharge mortality—largely occurred among individuals who had had no
post-discharge acute-care utilization.
What remains unclear is whether these changes in post-discharge mortality,
which is exclusively observed for patients with heart failure, represent a failure of
appreciating that these individuals needed acute care or a group with expected deaths

in the setting of comfort-centered, end-of-life care. We noted that this group of patients
that had high rates of palliative care utilization and discharge to hospice facilities.
However, these observations do not completely explain the elevated mortality risk in
patients who do not utilize post-discharge acute care. Moreover, while suggested in a
previous study,(5) patients with pneumonia have not had a consistent rise in postdischarge mortality in our more contemporary assessment.

Comparison to Literature and Implications for Health Policy
The study strongly suggests that the HRRP did not lead to harm through inappropriate
triage of high-risk patients to observation units and the ED, and therefore, represents
evidence against calls to curtail the program due to this theoretical concern.(6) The
concern was mainly raised by one study that ascribed a rising mortality in the period
spanning the HRRP announcement and implementation to the effects of the program,
also reporting that this increase was restricted to those not readmitted.(5) This study,
like others,(9, 27-29) found that post-discharge mortality in these conditions was
increasing nearly 3 years before HRRP announcement, but ascribed an excess
increase to HRRP after modelling HRRP’s effects as changes across four 30-month
periods discounting within period trends.(5) It also used inpatient data to define case
mix and used a consistent number of codes after the expansion of coding slots on
inpatient claims. The conclusions of the study contrasted with another that also found
an increase in heart failure and pneumonia mortality during 2006-2014 but did not find
inflections in the slopes of monthly rates of mortality in interrupted time series models,
while specifically accounting for within-period trends.(9) Moreover, it used inpatient,

outpatient and physician claims for risk adjustment, and used all claims data for
covariate identification after code slots expanded, without any analytic differences
emerging due to covariate selection strategies. Interestingly, a recent study by the
authors whose initial study suggested a rise in mortality for heart failure and pneumonia
in Medicare following HRRP implementation found no changes in mortality for these
conditions after modeling them as monthly changes during 2012-2015,(23) despite
including the same study population and the same data. The study also did not report
mortality rates in observation units and the ED, despite a focus on the care in these
settings.(23)
Other studies using national Medicare data have focused on temporal trends in
subgroups of hospitals and patients,(30, 31) and are therefore, not directly comparable
to the above studies focusing on overall trends. Finally, an analysis using 100 thousand
hospitalizations among Medicare beneficiaries in a quality improvement registry drawn
from 500 US hospitals, which captured an inconceivably low 2 heart failure
hospitalizations on average per hospital per month, did not replicate the secular trends
in heart failure readmissions or mortality nationally.(22, 32) It, therefore, cannot form the
basis of generalizable conclusions about the effects of the program.(32) The reassuring
findings from the current study complement hospital-level assessments, which have
found that reduction in readmissions are on average associated with reductions in
mortality.(33) There has also been no evidence to support the hypothesis of gaming of
quality measures by delaying or deferring readmissions, as there are no discontinuities
in readmission or mortality around day-30.(34)

Our study also explores other potential concurrent changes in patient care, such
as the end-of-life care that may reflect in post-discharge outcomes. However, whether
markers of debility or end-of-life care require consideration in measures cannot be
directly inferred. Rates of these illnesses among those readmitted are low and because
they are potentially related to the quality of in-hospital care processes, excluding them
in the assessment of readmission measures may not be appropriate. Finally, the current
mortality measures were designed with considerations for such care needs before the
index hospitalization, and patients receiving hospice care are excluded from the
measure population.(35, 36) These measures focus on post-admission 30-day mortality,
which capture the entirety of the care experience of patients during hospitalization and
in the post-discharge period. Hospitals, therefore, focus on this composite of mortality.
The current discussion about HRRP has exclusively focused on post-discharge
mortality, despite a notable concurrent trend for reduction in in-hospital deaths, which
have reduced at a comparable rate as the rise in post-discharge deaths. An
independent assessment by MedPAC also found that risk-adjusted cumulative inhospital and post-discharge 30-day mortality have slightly decreased over the period
spanning the introduction of the HRRP.(3, 37)

Limitations
Our study has some limitations. We are unable to identify patterns of acute care during
the index hospitalization that would be associated with a higher rate of post-discharge
acute care in observation units and EDs, and whether these visits represented avenues
for planned post-discharge follow-up care. Moreover, the proportion of these care

encounters that were preventable remains poorly understood. Next, our assessment of
discharge destination is exploratory, and does not track the patient’s location in the
post-discharge period. Finally, we were unable to elucidate the cause of death among
individuals who did not seek post-acute care but died after a hospitalization due to our
use of deidentified data. However, this is unlikely to represent refusal of care, as there
are specific laws against refusal of care of acutely ill patients requesting emergency
care. Moreover, current quality measures do not disincentivize care in the ED or
observation units, and there are no incentives for hospitals to refuse acute or emergent
care. Also, our study focuses on all US hospitals, and not merely the hospital with the
index hospitalization, and the other hospitals do not have a reason to refuse needed
care. An investigation into these deaths remains an important unaddressed question.

CONCLUSION
Among patients hospitalized with conditions targeted in the HRRP, a recent decrease in
readmissions is balanced by an increase in post-discharge 30-day observation stays
and ED visits, such that the overall post-discharge acute utilization has remained
unchanged. However, there is no evidence for harm related to increasing care in
alternative acute care settings, and patients who received care in observation units or
EDs, and were not readmitted, had low rates of post-discharge 30-day mortality and
were not affected by the announcement or the implementation of the HRRP.
