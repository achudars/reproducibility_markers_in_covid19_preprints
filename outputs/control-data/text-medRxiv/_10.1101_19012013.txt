ABSTRACT
Background: The association between mitochondrial DNA-copy number (mtDNA-CN) and
incident heart failure (HF) in the general population is unclear.
Methods: We examined the association between mtDNA-CN and the risk of incident HF among
10,802 participants free of HF at baseline from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC)
study, a large bi-racial population-based cohort. mtDNA-CN was estimated using probe
intensities on the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human single nucleotide polymorphisms Array 6.0.
Incident HF events were identified through hospital discharge codes from 1987 until 2005 and
through adjudication by the ARIC HF Classification Committee since 2005.
Results: During a median follow-up of 23.1 years, there were 2,227 incident HF events
(incidence rate 10.3 per 1000 person-years). In fully adjusted models, the hazard ratios (95%
confidence intervals) for HF comparing the 2nd through 5th quintiles of mtDNA-CN to the 1st
quintile were 0.91 (0.80–1.04), 0.82 (0.72–0.93), 0.81 (0.71–0.92), and 0.74 (0.65–0.85),
respectively (P for trend < 0.001). In stratified analyses, the associations between mtDNA-CN
and HF were similar across examined subgroups. The inverse association between mtDNA-CN
and incident HF was stronger in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) than in HF with
preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).
Conclusions: In this prospective cohort, mtDNA-CN was inversely associated with the risk of
incident HF suggesting that reduced levels of mtDNA-CN, a biomarker of mitochondrial
dysfunction, could reflect early susceptibility to HF.

INTRODUCTION
Heart failure (HF) is a leading clinical and public health concern affecting 23 million

3

people globally and 6.2 million adults in the United States alone.1,2 The lifetime risk of

4

developing HF is 20% and the prevalence of HF in the US is expected to increase by nearly 50%

5

by the year 2030.3,4 Despite recent improvements, the prognosis of HF is still poor, with 5-year

6

mortality >40%.5-8 Thus, it is critical to identify novel pathways that can help design new

7

preventive strategies and characterize subjects at high risk of developing HF.

8

Mitochondria generate nearly all energy used by the cell as adenosine triphosphate

9

(ATP).9 Each mitochondrion has 2 to 10 copies of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), for a total of

10

103 to 104 copies of mtDNA per cell. mtDNA copy number (mtDNA-CN) changes with energy

11

demands and with oxidative stress, and has been established as an indirect biomarker of

12

mitochondrial dysfunction.10,11 Reduced mtDNA-CN measured in peripheral blood is associated

13

with cardiovascular disease (CVD), all-cause mortality, hypertension, diabetes, chronic kidney

14

disease, and sudden cardiac death.12-18

15

In a case-control study, hospitalized patients with HF had lower mtDNA-CN in

16

peripheral blood compared to controls without HF, and when HF cases were followed up, those

17

with lower mtDNA-CN had a higher risk of cardiovascular death and rehospitalization compared

18

to those with higher mtDNA-CN.19 In small case-control studies, depletion of mtDNA in heart

19

tissue samples was associated with HF.20,21 The association between mtDNA-CN and incident

20

HF in the general population, however, is unknown. In the present study, we examined the

21

association between baseline mtDNA-CN and the risk of incident HF in the Atherosclerosis Risk

22

in Communities (ARIC) study, a large bi-racial population-based cohort.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

2

Study population

3

The ARIC study is a population-based prospective cohort of 15,792 individuals 45–65

4

years of age at the time of recruitment (1987–1989; Visit 1). ARIC participants were recruited

5

from 4 US communities: Forsyth County, NC; Jackson, MS; suburban Minneapolis, MN; and

6

Washington County, MD.22 Since the first study visit, there have been 6 subsequent in-person

7

visits (visits 2–7, with visit 7 currently underway) and regular telephone interviews (annually and

8

then semiannually since 2012). Our analysis was restricted to 11,453 White or Black participants

9

who had DNA collected in one of the visits to generate mtDNA-CN measurements

10

(Supplementary Figure 1). We then excluded Black participants recruited from Minnesota or

11

Maryland (n = 1), participants without follow-up information (n = 1), and participants with

12

prevalent HF at the time of DNA collection (n = 596). We further excluded participants missing

13

information on body mass index (n = 17) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (n =

14

14). The final sample included 10,802 participants (4,918 men and 5,904 women without HF at

15

the time of DNA sampling). All centers obtained approval from their respective institutional

16

review boards and all participants provided written informed consent.

Measurements
ARIC participants underwent a comprehensive cardiovascular examination and interview

20

by trained clinical staff members during each clinic visit. Age, sex, race/ethnicity, smoking

21

status, alcohol intake, and medication history were self-reported. Smoking and alcohol intake

22

were categorized as never, former, and current. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated from

23

measured height and weight and categorized as underweight/normal (<25 kg/m2), overweight

(≥25 to <30 kg/m2), or obese (≥30 kg/m2). Blood samples were collected for glucose, total

2

cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol measurements.

3

Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmHg, diastolic blood

4

pressure ≥90 mmHg, or current use of anti-hypertensive medication. Diabetes was defined as

5

self-reported physician diagnosis of diabetes, fasting glucose ≥126 mg/dL, non-fasting glucose

6

≥200 mg/dL, or use of hypoglycemic medication. Prevalent coronary heart disease (CHD) was

7

defined as the presence of a myocardial infarction based on self-report or electrocardiogram in

8

visit 1, or the development of an adjudicated definite or probable myocardial infarction prior to

9

the time of DNA collection for mtDNA-CN measurement.

Measurement of mtDNA copy number
The methods for measuring mtDNA-CN have been described previously.17,23 Briefly,

13

DNA was extracted using the Gentra Puregene Blood Kit (Qiagen N.V., Venlo, The

14

Netherlands) from buffy coat of whole blood samples collected in visits 1–4. mtDNA-CN was

15

calculated from probe intensities of mitochondrial single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on

16

the Affymetrix Genome-Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 using the Genvisis software package

17

(www.genvisis.org), which uses the median mitochondrial probe intensity of 25 high-quality

18

mitochondrial probes as initial raw measure of mtDNA-CN. Batch effects, DNA quality, and

19

starting DNA quantity were corrected for by using surrogate variable analysis applied to probe

20

intensities of 43,316 autosomal SNPs.24 The mtDNA-CN metric used in this analysis was

21

obtained as the standardized residuals (mean 0 and standard deviation 1) in a linear regression in

22

which initial raw estimates of mtDNA-CN were regressed against age, sex, enrollment center,

23

surrogate variables used in the surrogate variable analysis, and white blood cell count. White

blood cell count was not available in 14.9% of individuals and we imputed the mean for the

2

missing values.23 DNA for mtDNA-CN for this analysis was obtained from ARIC visit 1 (1987–

3

1989) in 429 participants, visit 2 (1990–1992) in 8,655 participants, visit 3 (1993–1995) in 1,654

4

participants, and visit 4 (1996–1998) in 64 participants. For each participant, we used the visit in

5

which DNA for mtDNA-CN assays was obtained as the baseline visit.

Outcome definition and adjudication
Incident HF was defined as the first hospitalization for HF or death related to HF after the
visit in which DNA was obtained for mtDNA-CN assays. Hospitalizations and deaths related to

10

HF were identified as International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision code 428, and

11

International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision code I50 in discharge codes or in

12

underlying cause of death, respectively. Since 2005, ARIC began adjudication of HF events by

13

the ARIC HF Classification Committee.25 In addition, when available, adjudicated incident HF

14

was further classified as HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF, most recent left ventricular

15

ejection fraction [LVEF] <50%), HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF, LVEF ≥50%), or

16

HF with unknown LVEF.

Statistical analysis
Study participants were followed from the visit of DNA collection for mtDNA-CN assay

20

until the development of HF, death, loss to follow-up, or December 31, 2017, whichever came

21

first. We used a Cox proportional hazards model to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95%

22

confidence intervals (CI) for the association between mtDNA-CN and incident HF. mtDNA-CN

23

was first categorized into quintiles based on the overall sample distribution. In secondary

analysis, mtDNA-CN was modeled as a continuous variable to estimate the HR for incident HF

2

comparing the 90th to the 10th percentile of mtDNA-CN. In addition, mtDNA-CN was modeled

3

as restricted quadratic splines with knots at the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles to provide a smooth

4

and flexible description of the dose-response relationship between mtDNA-CN and HF. We

5

tested for the proportional hazards assumption using Schoenfeld residuals but the assumption

6

was not met (P < 0.001). Therefore, to allow the effect of mtDNA-CN on incident HF to vary by

7

time, we used a parametric survival models with spline variables created separately for baseline

8

hazard and for time-dependent effects.26

9

To control for potential confounders, we used 4 models with progressive degrees of

10

adjustment using covariates measured at the time of mtDNA-CN measurement: Model 1 was

11

adjusted for age, sex, race, and enrollment center; Model 2 was further adjusted for BMI,

12

smoking, and alcohol intake; Model 3 was further adjusted for total and HDL-cholesterol,

13

cholesterol medication, hypertension, and diabetes; and Model 4 was further adjusted for

14

prevalent CHD.

15

We performed stratified analyses by pre-specified subgroups defined by age (<60 or ≥60

16

years), sex, race (White or Black), smoking status (never, former, or current), alcohol intake

17

(never, former, current), BMI (underweight/normal, overweight, or obese), and prevalent CHD

18

status. We also performed several sensitivity analyses. First, we repeated the main analyses

19

treating non-HF related deaths as a competing event using a proportional sub-distribution

20

hazards model. Second, we used alternative definitions for incident HF: 1) discharge codes for

21

HF for the entire follow-up period, regardless of adjudication; 2) HF events restricted to

22

adjudicated cases that occurred since January 1, 2005, and 3) discharge codes for HF restricted to

23

cases that occurred since January 1, 2005. For the two analyses restricted to events since 2005,

we used late entries to address the issue of immortal person time prior to 2005. Third, also using

2

HF events adjudicated after 2005 and late entries, we estimated the HRs for HFrEF and HFpEF

3

separately using a proportional sub-distribution hazards model with non-HF related deaths and

4

unknown type of HF as competing events. All statistical analyses were performed using Stata

5

version 15.0 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).

RESULTS
The mean age (standard deviation) of study participants at baseline was 57.3 (5.9) years
(Table 1). Participants with lower mtDNA-CN levels were more likely to be current smokers, to

10

have a higher prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and CHD, and to have lower HDL-

11

cholesterol levels than those with higher mtDNA-CN levels.

12

During a median follow-up of 23.1 years, we identified 2,227 new cases of HF (incidence

13

rate of 10.3 per 1000 person-years). In fully adjusted models, the HRs (95% CI) for HF

14

comparing the 2nd through 5th quintiles of mtDNA-CN to the 1st quintile were 0.91 (0.80–1.04),

15

0.82 (0.72–0.93), 0.81 (0.71–0.92), and 0.74 (0.65–0.85), respectively (P for trend < 0.001;

16

Table 2). The fully adjusted HR for HF comparing the 90th to the 10th percentile of mtDNA-CN

17

was 0.76 (0.69–0.84). In spline regression analysis, mtDNA-CN was inversely associated with

18

the risk of incident HF with an approximately linear dose-response relationship (P-value for non-

19

linear spline terms 0.74; Figure 1). The results were similar when we used hospital discharge

20

codes for HF, adjudicated HF cases since 2005, or hospital discharge codes for HF since 2005, or

21

when non-HF related deaths were treated as a competing event (Supplementary Tables 1–4).

22
23

In stratified analyses, the associations between mtDNA-CN and HF were similar across
subgroups defined by age, sex, race, smoking status, and history of CHD (Figure 2). The

associations were weaker in participants who currently drink alcohol compared to those who did

2

not drink (P for interaction = 0.01), and in participants who were overweight compared to those

3

who were underweight or normal weight (P for interaction = 0.05).

4

When we tested the proportional hazards assumption, the association between mtDNA-

5

CN and HF was progressively attenuated from the time of mtDNA-CN measurement (Table 3

6

and Figure 3). The fully adjusted HRs for HF comparing the 90th to the 10th percentile of

7

mtDNA-CN at 10, 20, and 30 years since mtDNA-CN measurement were 0.65 (0.54–0.79), 0.89

8

(0.76–1.04), and 0.99 (0.72–1.37), respectively.

9

Finally, when we separated HF events into HFpEF and HFrEF using data since 2005, the

10

inverse association between mtDNA-CN and incident HF was stronger in HFrEF than in HFpEF

11

(Table 4), although the trend was not statistically significant in either type of HF (P for trend

12

0.73 and 0.12 in HFpEF and HFrEF, respectively).

15

DISCUSSION
In this large community-based prospective cohort, mtDNA-CN was inversely associated

16

with the risk of incident HF. The association was approximately linear and consistent across

17

population subgroups. The association, however, was strongest early after measurement of

18

mtDNA-CN and was progressively attenuated over 30 years of follow-up. These findings

19

suggest a potential role of mtDNA-CN as an early indicator for HF, particularly for events in the

20

near future.

21

Decreased mtDNA-CN is associated with CVD events, including sudden cardiac death,

22

all-cause mortality, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease.12-18 However, the

23

association between mtDNA-CN and incident HF is largely unknown. In animal studies, mtDNA

24

damage and depletion were associated with the development of dilated cardiomyopathy and

impaired left ventricular remodeling after ischemic injury.27-30 In small case-control studies,

2

patients with HF had decreased mtDNA-CN levels in heart tissue samples compared to controls

3

without HF.21,31 In another case-control study, hospitalized patients with HF had lower mtDNA-

4

CN in peripheral blood compared to those without HF.19 When patients with HF were followed

5

up for a median of 17 months, those with peripheral blood mtDNA-CN levels below the median

6

were more likely to experience cardiovascular death and rehospitalization compared to those

7

with mtDNA-CN levels above the median.19

8

The mechanisms underlying the association between mtDNA-CN and HF are unclear.

9

Established risk factors for HF include hypertension, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, ischemic

10

heart disease, and non-ischemic cardiomyopathies,32,33 and oxidative stress is assumed to play a

11

major role in the development and progression of HF.34-38 Endogenous mtDNA damage is

12

mainly caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) as a by-product of oxidative phosphorylation.

13

High levels of ROS trigger further increases in ROS generation, a process known as

14

mitochondrial ROS-induced ROS release.39 Exogeneous agents, such as cigarette smoke,

15

industrial by-products, ultraviolet and ionizing radiation, environmental toxins and chemicals,

16

and chemotherapeutic drugs may also damage mtDNA.40 mtDNA is particularly susceptible to

17

damage and mutations due to its close proximity to mitochondrial ROS production sites, lack of

18

protective histones, and limited repair activity.34 Moreover, damage caused by ROS is more

19

extensive and persists longer in mtDNA than in nuclear DNA.41

20

Mitochondrial ROS generation and mtDNA damage in cardiomyocytes lead to impaired

21

electron chain transport and ATP synthesis, modifications to proteins involved in excitation-

22

contraction coupling, and activation of hypertrophy signaling kinases and transcription factors,

23

apoptotic pathways, inflammatory mediators, and matrix metalloproteinases.34,42,43 This process

leads to a reduction in the number of mitochondria, hypertrophy, apoptosis, and necrosis of

2

cardiomyocytes, impairment of contractile function, and fibrosis, which, in combination, lead to

3

the initiation and progression of cardiac remodeling and ultimately to HF. Systemic oxidative

4

stress is also closely linked to the development of vascular diseases, such as hypertension, which

5

are major risk factors for HF.34,38,44,45 Finally, treatment with chemotherapeutic agents that

6

inhibit DNA replication, such as nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors or anthracycline, is

7

also associated with both mtDNA depletion and cardiomyopathy.46-48

8
9

In our study, mtDNA-CN measurements were derived from the buffy coat of peripheral
blood and were not a direct measurement of mtDNA-CN in cardiomyocytes. Leukocyte mtDNA-

10

CN was correlated with mtDNA-CN in cardiomyocytes in one study.19 In another study of non-

11

ischemic cardiomyopathy patients, there was a moderate correlation between whole blood

12

mtDNA-CN and myocardial mtDNA-CN.49 Additional research is needed to understand the

13

association between mtDNA-CN in peripheral blood and in target tissues, and to elucidate the

14

mechanisms linking mtDNA-CN in peripheral blood with incident HF.

15

Other limitations also need to be considered in the interpretation of our findings. First,

16

mtDNA-CN was measured only once and we could not evaluate changes in mtDNA-CN after the

17

baseline visit. In fact, the association between mtDNA-CN and incident HF decreased

18

progressively over follow-up, although mtDNA-CN was inversely associated with HF for at least

19

two decades after measurement. Second, systematic adjudication of HF events only occurred

20

after 2005. However, the sensitivity and positive predictive value of ICD-9 codes for HF

21

compared to adjudicated acute decompensated HF and chronic HF in ARIC were relatively high

22

at 0.95 and 0.77, respectively, and the results from our sensitivity analyses were consistent for

23

analyses based on discharge codes and for those based on adjudicated events.25 Third, our

analysis of the specific association of mtDNA-CN levels and subtypes of HF was restricted to

2

events occurring after 2005, and we had limited power to identify differences between HFpEF

3

and HFrEF. Finally, we were not able to evaluate the association between mtDNA-CN level and

4

the severity of HF symptoms as such information was not available for all participants.

5

The major strengths of this study include the prospective design with a long duration of

6

follow-up to capture HF events, the large sample size, the high quality of field and laboratory

7

methods of the ARIC study, and the ability to account for multiple potential confounders for the

8

association between mtDNA-CN and incident HF. In addition, we used state-of-the art tools to

9

measure mtDNA-CN.23

12

CONCLUSIONS
In this large community-based prospective cohort, mtDNA-CN was inversely associated

13

with the risk of incident HF suggesting that reduced levels of mtDNA-CN, a biomarker of

14

mitochondrial dysfunction, could reflect early susceptibility to HF. Further studies are needed to

15

better understand the underlying mechanisms and to characterize the association of mtDNA-CN

16

with different types of HF and their severity.
