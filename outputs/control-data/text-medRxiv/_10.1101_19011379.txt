Conditions affecting medical leadership

Abstract
Introduction: The influx of management ideas into health care has triggered considerable
debate about if and how managerial and medical logics can co-exist. Recent reviews suggest
that clinician involvement in hospital leadership can lead to superior performance.
Objective: To systematically explore the conditions instrumental for medical leadership to
have an impact on organizational performance.
Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, and Psychinfo for peer-reviewed,
empirical, English language articles and reviews published between January 1, 2006 and
August 12, 2018. We performed a thematic synthesis through inductive line-by-line coding of
the included studies.
Results: The search yielded 1447 publications, of which 62 were included. Three major
themes were identified that described a movement 1. From medical protectionism to
management through medicine, 2. From command and control to participatory leadership
practices, and 3. Organizational practices to support incidental versus willing leaders. Based
on these themes, the authors developed a model to depict conditions that facilitate or impede
the influence of medical leadership through a virtuous cycle of management through medicine
or a vicious cycle of medical protectionism.
Conclusions: This review helps individuals, organizations, educators, and trainers better
understand how medical leadership can be both a boon and a barrier to the performance of
health care organizations. In contrast to the conventional view of conflicting logics, medical
leadership would benefit from a more integrative mental model of management and medicine.
Nurturing medical engagement requires participatory leadership enabled through long-term
investments at the individual, organizational, and system levels. These combined efforts will

Strengths and limitations of this study
•

While previous literature reviews have established a correlation between physicians in
leadership roles and organizational performance, this is to our knowledge the first
review that seeks to explore what contributes to that link.

•

The review expands on the typically quantitative focus of systematic reviews by
providing a thematic synthesis of fifty-five empirical studies and seven literature
reviews.

•

A model is presented that depicts a virtuous cycle of management through medicine
and a vicious cycle of medical protectionism.

•

This review is limited by the quality and heterogeneity of the included studies.

•

While plausible correlations between conditions and performance outcomes are
explored, to establish causality requires study designs that can determine the strength
of the relationships.

Conditions affecting medical leadership

INTRODUCTION
Organizational research has established a link between leadership practices and
performance.[1] As health care searches for its success formula, the impact of medical
leadership on performance has become an increasingly relevant research objective. The two
most recent systematic reviews on the subject suggest that clinician involvement in hospital
leadership can be linked to superior performance.[2,3] The inclusion of clinical leaders
(primarily physicians) in senior management roles has a positive impact on care quality,
management of financial and operational resources, and social performance, albeit a few
studies showed a negative impact on the latter two.[2] Additional reviews have found effects
on staff satisfaction, retention, performance, and burnout;[4–6] psychological safety, respect,
and shared goals;[7] approval and support of political reforms[8]; and the adoption of
information technology.[9]
While the reviews describe the challenge to discern why medical leadership makes a
difference, Sarto and Veronesi,[2] hypothesize about possible mediating mechanisms (Figure
1).
<<<Insert Figure 1 here>>>
The core explanation proffered is centered on the individual’s credibility and competence
generated by a medical degree.[2] However, two observations can be made, both of which
warrant a further qualitative exploration. The first is that the mediating mechanisms are drawn
from authors discussions of their quantitative results rather than research designed to
specifically explore the mechanisms behind the connections. The second is that the mediating
mechanisms exist within a context,[10] i.e. there are conditions that influence to what extent
medical competence and credibility can benefit organizational performance. The aim of this

study is therefore to systematically explore the conditions instrumental for medical leadership
to have an impact on organizational performance.
METHODS
Review protocol
This systematic literature review is a thematic synthesis of empirical studies and literature
reviews. Thematic synthesis was chosen in order to expand the traditionally quantitative focus
of systematic reviews with a method that accommodates a diversity of study designs, provides
policy-makers and practitioners more nuanced evidence for a complex question,[11] and
enables to develop insights beyond those of the original studies through an higher-order
thematic structure.[11,12] Given its qualitative nature, it was guided by the ENhancing
Transparency in REporting the synthesis of Qualitative research (ENTREQ) statement
(Appendix 1).[13] Patients or the public were not involved in the design, or conduct, or
reporting, or dissemination plans of our research.
Search strategy
The strategy was developed with assistance from a professional research librarian. We
conducted a comprehensive search for scientific articles published between January 1st 2006
and August 12th 2018. We limited the search timeline to capture contemporary evidence in the
light of recently established correlations between medical leadership and performance.[2] We
defined this as the last decade of publications. As the study originally commenced in 2016, we
updated the search on 12th of August 2018. Boolean searches were performed in
Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, and Psychinfo. As the focus was on physicians, other
health care databases such as CINAHL, were excluded. To identify a wide range of studies,
all possible truncated combinations of keywords and MeSH terms such as
“clinical/medical/physician/doctor management/leadership”, “organization and management”,

Conditions affecting medical leadership

“physician executive”, “performance”, and “quality of health care” were used. The search was
complemented with additional articles from the reference lists of the articles selected for fulltext review.
Study selection
Aggregated search results were imported to the Mendeley reference management system
where duplicates were removed. Remaining records were subjected to three rounds of
screening. Inclusion criteria were that articles were peer-reviewed, empirical studies or
literature reviews, and in the English language, published between January 2006 and August
2018 which focused on physicians in the leadership and management of health care. We
included literature reviews to capture patterns across a wide span of studies, i.e. we did not
use these to assess the relative importance of individual factors, but rather to identify relevant
themes in the literature.
Exclusion criteria were publication prior to 2006, non-English language, not empirical or
literature reviews, non-peer-reviewed, did not include physicians as study participants, and
were reports on care and treatment planning for specific medical conditions. These inclusion
and exclusion criteria were applied, when the first author first screened all titles and key
words, and then the remaining abstracts. Then, all authors screened the records eligible for
full text review and applied further exclusion criteria: full-text not available; purely
quantitative reports on organizational performance outcomes or leadership development
evaluations; not addressing physicians in the leadership and management of health care (i.e.
not about their role in quality improvement, coordination of care, resource management, team
leadership, change management, policy reform, or descriptions of their individual experiences
in such roles). Any discrepancies regarding inclusion were resolved through consensus. Due
to the diversity of study designs and contexts, and the intention to capture a thematic account,

the quality of individual studies in terms of strength of evidence was not assessed as per
established convention.[13,14]
Data extraction and analysis
Data on general characteristics included type of study design, country of origin, setting, and
study participants. Data extraction and analysis followed an inductive approach. The results
sections were read line-by-line to identify meaning units describing the conditions
instrumental to medical leadership. The first author summarized these as codes, which were
then organized into descriptive themes by all authors.[12] Based on these themes, the authors
developed a preliminary model (analytical themes) to depict conditions that facilitate or
impede physician leadership.[12] The model was tested for face validity and refined to
improve clarity after discussions with practicing clinicians and managers in our graduate and
continuing professional development courses and at conferences in Sweden and Europe. Data
extraction and analysis was performed in NVivo qualitative data analysis software; QSR
International Pty Ltd. Version 10, 2012.
RESULTS
The initial search identified 1447 records (PubMed 437, Web of Science 896, and Psychinfo
114). After removing duplicates and adding 26 records identified from reference lists, the tally
was 1424 records. Titles and key words were screened which yielded 367 records. After their
abstracts were screened,189 articles remained. After screening the full texts, 62 articles were
included in the thematic synthesis (Figure 2). Of these, fifty-five were empirical articles
(qualitative, quantitative or mixed methods designs) and seven literature reviews.

General characteristics
Most studies were conducted in the UK (n=17) and the US (n=14), in hospital settings (n=40),
and focused on senior managers (n=14). Qualitative designs were used in 23 studies, followed
by 12 surveys and 10 case studies (Figure 3). The empirical studies together reported on 906
hours of observations, 1417 interviews, and 22643 survey responses. A detailed overview of
the included studies is provided in Appendix 2.

Conditions affecting medical leadership

From medical protectionism to management through medicine
Variations in the perceptions of management, views of oneself as a manager, motivation to
lead, and the role and outcomes of managerial strategies can be described as medical
protectionism or management through medicine.
Medical protectionism
Managerial and clinical logics are challenging for physicians to reconcile.[15–18] Medical
leaders are perceived to occupy a no-mans-land,[19] often not meeting the expectations and
authority vested in them.[20] Many are concerned with losing their credibility among their
peers and becoming outsiders,[21] with management referred to as the “dark side”.[15,17,22]
They perceive themselves as struggling heroes, “working against the odds or as righteous
victims struggling in the face of adversity”.[15]
Physicians’ motivation to be involved in leadership is to safeguard their autonomy, identity,
status, influence, and to resist changes tied to their specialty independent of the organization’s
needs and goals. They adopt or adapt managerial practices and accept managerial roles as a
custodial strategy, referred to as “paradigm freeze”.[6,23–26] This “modernized
professionalism” creates new forms of self-regulation and self-management, such as resisting
managers’ attempts to control patient safety programs; focusing on minimum necessary
reporting; selectively participating in managerial meetings; sending out last minute meeting
agendas to limit managers’ participation; or concealing the significance of certain
decisions.[24,27] As clinical managers appear to adhere to managerial control, their clinical
identity and professional objectives remain unaffected, i.e. loyalty to the profession has
trumped loyalty to the organization.[19,24] These dynamics result in personal struggles
causing clinicians to disengage from difficult interactions with colleagues and patients, and
the medical decision-making suffers.[28] When ignoring as opposed to engaging with these
aspects of professional cultures, professional resistance to change can be triggered.[29]

Conditions affecting medical leadership

Management through medicine
Studies suggest an opportunity to move beyond an adversarial view of management and
medicine.[24] Knowledge brokering as described in the concept of hybrid managers can be
replaced with an integrative mindset where management is intertwined with expert knowledge
through openness, trust, respect, and cooperation, and understood through its impact on
clinical practice,[16–18,24,30,31] so that medical leaders can enhance their physician
identities by bridging management and medicine.[22]
As physicians are driven by a desire to make a difference, improve, and innovate and want to
be engaged and become good leaders,[32,33] managerial discourse should build on their inner
drive, resonate with their mental models, and be anchored in quality improvement, i.e. a
“professional path”.[18] This “new professionalism” identifies productivity as a route to selfgovernance where medical leaders achieve superior performance by defining their own and
other’s roles, connect staff, and focus on goal attainment.[18,34–37]
Management through medicine has been strengthened by new roles for physicians (e.g.
pathway coordinators and hospitalists) and multi-professional, team-based service delivery
approaches which mediate status differences and facilitate knowledge-sharing across
professions.[16,32,38,39] These allow physicians to enter managerial work earlier in their
careers,[20] and thereby improve their managerial capabilities, including building their social
capital and developing different perspectives on problems and solutions.[16,18] While some
leaders feel it is inappropriate to retain clinical commitments due to a risk of being seen as
partisan in relation to a specialty or service,[22] most choose to continue clinical practice to
maintain a sense of belonging, enhance legitimacy, and provide inspiration and insights into
daily work, but also to keep the option of returning to clinical work in case of failure as a
leader.[22,31,33,40]

Conditions affecting medical leadership

As discourse has not only a descriptive but also a performative role, there has been a
conscious move to replace the managerial discourse with a leadership discourse.[35,40,41]
The term “medical leadership” resonates better with professional groups, can remove tensions
between operational requirements and visionary aspirations, and potentially influence new
work practices.[35,41]

From command and control to participatory leadership practices
Organizational attributes, strategies in performance measurement and their outcomes can be
described either as management trough command and control or as participatory leadership
practices.
Management through command and control
Bureaucratic, policy-driven, and hierarchical workplaces with poor organizational
communication practices, lack of support for innovation, conflicts, and incompetence hinder
physician engagement.[32,42–44] Matrix organizations and distributed leadership are
presented as solutions, yet medical leaders still believe that real decision-making power lies
outside of care environments, is externalized, and hierarchical.[15,45] Decentralization has
been highlighted as a contributor to role ambiguity and overload.[17,46] A lack of support
leads physicians to rely on personality, status, and hierarchy, which are insufficient for
complex tasks.[28,47] This has a disengaging effect.[32]
Clinicians on different management levels in hospitals and primary care describe a sense of
powerlessness over being held accountable for performance measures and organizational
issues with neither the authority, staff, budget, time, nor support to actually implement change
or to improve.[15,21,32,45,46,48] The overwhelming number of performance targets and
guidelines that are externally imposed conflict with professional values and interests,[26,49]

and are so demanding that managers tend to focus on compliance, rather than the proactive
development of new solutions, and interest in knowledge creation and innovation
diminishes.[16,49] Lack of internal peer support makes medical leaders feel that they are
alone with their managerial challenges with limited opportunities to discuss and develop ideas
for improvement.[21,44] The positive potential of performance measurement, particularly in
terms of monitoring quality data, does not materialize due to a lack of ownership over the
indicators and also because of problems with access to data and insufficient resources for data
collection.[21,48] The time delay between patient safety incidents and quality reports
undermine clinicians’ confidence in the data[49] and impede accountability for outcomes.[28]
Participatory leadership practices
Physicians need to be given the opportunity to exhibit inclusive leadership behaviors such as
explicitly soliciting team input and engaging in participatory decision-making, which in turn
help improve their managerial self-efficacy.[3,50] Working with a shared vision,
demonstrating compassion, and other positive leadership experiences are associated with
managerial job engagement, performance, and participation in leadership activities.[32,44,51–
53]
Co-designing performance measures with clinicians, motivates, provides autonomy, makes
measurement meaningful, enables local improvement, and can reinforce professionalism in
ways that improve the manager-clinician relationship.[24,35,38,39,48,54–56] Physicians can
be engaged through continual dialogue to align agendas for quality and safety[21,39,57] and
through the design of service delivery.[3,15] Anchoring quality improvement in professional
practice, and combining it with education and research, lead to positive views on further
improvement initiatives.[3,21,25,29,32,35,38,39,56]

Similarly, budgetary participation supports accountability through autonomy as it positively
correlates with budget goal commitment, use of budget information, and therefore budgetary
performance.[58] It also improves overall managerial job engagement as it affects managerial
self-efficacy, helps to identify with organizational goals, and, along with role clarity,
promotes constructive managerial work attitudes.[51,58–60] Tools, such as managerial
accounting could co-exist with clinical practice as they are often seen as technical tools
without threat to professional autonomy.[24]

Organizational practices to nurture willing vs. incidental leaders
Organizational practices that nurture either willing or incidental leaders can be described in
terms of recruitment of medical leaders, top management support, and strategic leadership
development.
Recruitment of medical leaders
Health care organizations require a large number of clinically trained leaders at all levels of
the organization, in particular high quality first-line management.[6,19] Despite the fact that
interest in leadership can arise from boredom with clinical routine and a desire to take on new
challenges,[23] sixty-two percent of executive positions in teaching hospitals are filled by
external hires, which suggests a failure to identify, develop, and promote emerging leaders
from within the organization.[40,61] Recruitment of medical leaders most often occurs
through informal networks and succeeds through the persuasive ability of the current
managers, without explicit selection criteria or expectations related to performance objectives,
goals, or measures of success.[23,33,44,45] When formal recruitment procedures are
followed, the process still tends to be ad hoc and lessons learned by search committees are
neither captured nor shared. The consequence of these coercive or ad hoc approaches that

Conditions affecting medical leadership

generate “incidental” leaders instead of “willing” leaders can be seen early in leadership
development, where the latter are more able to “absorb” or construct managerial
expertise.[40,51,62]
To avoid “incidental” medical leaders, recruitment should be formalized, identification of
leadership potential should start at an early stage by engaging in conversations with front-line
physicians, and these future physician leaders should be supported and molded through opportunities to lead new initiatives.[2,23,32,40,44] In that process, assessment of professionals’
self-efficacy as a predictor of motivation to lead is recommended.[46] Selection of leaders
should be part of the overall talent management system[61] and the position should be
matched to the strategic, structural, and political context.[21,45,63] Demographics should be
considered to avoid management by the “old boys’ club”.[32] The recruitment process should
set clear expectations on what is acceptable professional behavior as a medical leader in order
to be able to enforce these behaviors in case of a mismatch.[63] While the most frequently
displayed and among the most valued leadership attributes among physicians is being
inspirational, it has the least impact on staff satisfaction.[4] Those physicians who
demonstrate interest in quality, patient safety, and overall leadership aptitude should be
sought.[21,45,63] Backgrounds as general internists and practicing hospitalists (or other
holistic specializations) seem favorable.[16,21]
Top management support
Senior leadership teams, particularly CEOs, manage physicians by nagging, arguing, and
reminding them of their responsibilities, i.e. they fail to meaningfully engage medical
leaders.[43,64,65] CEOs and senior leadership teams tend to crowd medical leaders’ agendas
with numerous committees or “strategic” meetings that are filled with operational, not
strategic matters.[21,41,44]

Conditions affecting medical leadership

A questionnaire study among staff at the NHS concluded that effective leadership practice
(e.g. engaging staff and collaborators in achieving a compelling vision) is correlated with
hospital performance.[1] In addition, there is a correlation between how effectively boards
work with quality of care and how well executive management teams as a consequence
monitor quality and manage operations.[55,57,66] Top-level teams should be stable and
acknowledge physicians’ medical expertise and academic competence,[52,65] and foster
collaborative relationships, effective communication, diffusion of expert knowledge between
managers and professionals, and demonstrate a proactive culture for decisionmaking.[24,32,49,54,63,67] They also need to remove barriers to medical leadership, e.g.
reduce the burden of administrative tasks related to information technology, performance
analysis, and financial management; lack of financial incentives; time commitment pressures;
overall lack of support, and challenges tied to the timing, location, and process of managerial
meetings.[17,20,23,28,31–33,44] This can be done by setting clear expectations[44],
introducing collective leadership[19] or through hybrid organizations.[68] The latter resonates
well with the idea of professional bureaucracies where staff has greater influence on decision
making than people in formal positions of authority.[19]
Strategic leadership development
Current undergraduate medical education programs provide only limited opportunities for
professional development and neglect strengthening the ethos and professionalism that would
make physicians better fit for the purpose of their work.[21] During their clinical careers, they
are not sufficiently exposed to professionals who are able to develop their managerial
mindset.[20] Management skills are perceived to be in conflict with a medical caseorientation and interventionist professional action.[29] Previous experiences of being a
manager at the unit level are not enough either – physicians still have the tendency to be
occupied with small scale problem solving which makes it difficult to develop the essential

strategic hospital-wide perspective.[20] Even if physicians enter management, they see this
merely as an intermediate role.[31] Medical leaders feel they are thrown into their roles and
then expected to learn management on their own and on-the-fly.[23,33] Traditional leadership
development programs tend to emphasize the difference between management and leadership,
which adds to the problem of translating these to practical situations where they actually are
intertwined.[41] Leadership training is rarely followed up with concrete opportunities to
engage in hospital strategy development.[20]
The introduction of management competencies needs to start early and focus on taking
initiative, organizational and system understanding, becoming team players, communication,
and shared decision-making.[20,28,65] Leadership development provides four important
opportunities to improve quality and efficiency in healthcare, by (1) increasing the caliber of
the workforce, (2) enhancing efficiency in the organization’s education and development
activities, (3) reducing turnover and related expenses, and (4) focusing organizational
attention on specific strategic priorities.[69] Training should improve leaders abilities to
address system level challenges and benefit the service, not just the individual.[19,70]
Development initiatives create a space for informal conversations that shape attitudes towards
teamwork, safety, management and working conditions.[16,41,71] Investments in leadership
development should be made at all organizational levels and be seen as part of the strategic
development of an organization.[19]
Teaching approaches should move from competency to capability development through
integration with ongoing improvement efforts where the focus is on participants’ actual
challenges as opposed to merely talking about problem solving.[22,23,29,62,63] Everyday
work practices can become opportunities to develop and test new approaches to service
provision and to acquire management and leadership skills (e.g. via efficient meetings,
medical teamwork, joint decision-making, and the delegation of responsibilities).[25,29]

Conditions affecting medical leadership

Inter-professional education and training are critical to improve managerial self-efficacy,
interest, and readiness to be involved in managerial work.[32,38,40,46] Through mentoring,
coaching and networks, medical leaders with similar roles can share experiences, tools, and
strategies.[21,22,32,40]
DISCUSSION
This review provides an in-depth analysis of the conditions instrumental for medical
leadership to have an impact on organizational performance. Based on the identified
conditions that facilitate or impede the influence of medical leadership, two opposing
schemata related to willing vs. incidental leadership can be discerned (Figure 4).
<<<Insert Figure 4 here>>>

The virtuous cycle describes a set of interdependent strategies that help to anchor
management in medicine. The pivotal point is to identify willing leaders who are committed
to continually improve their own management and leadership competencies. They are
nurtured by an embedded leadership development strategy that fosters participatory leadership
practices. Participation cultivates medical engagement among staff and thereby increases
interest in leadership roles and management positions. This, in turn, contributes to favorable
conditions for formal recruitment and expands the recruitment pool of future willing leaders.
In the vicious cycle, managerial positions are filled by incidental leaders with little interest to
improve their own leadership competencies. The lack of interest is reinforced by disconnected
leadership development efforts that are perceived as irrelevant to the improvement of health
care. Managers mimic historically dominant managerial approaches, i.e. management by
command and control, which leads to medical disengagement among staff. Disinterest in

leadership roles encourages informal recruitment practices which perpetuates the risk for
incidental leaders.

The findings of this review resonate with the emerging field of research tied to physician or
medical engagement. Medical engagement is defined as a reciprocal relationship between the
individuals and the organizational system: “the active and positive contribution of doctors,
within their normal working roles, to maintaining and enhancing the performance of the
organization, which itself recognizes this commitment, in supporting and encouraging high
quality care”.[52] A recent review elaborates that physician engagement is about “regular
participation of physicians in (1) deciding how their work is done, (2) making suggestions for
improvement, (3) goal setting, (4) planning, and (5) monitoring of their performance in
activities targeted at the micro (patient), meso (organization), and/or macro (health system)
levels.”[72]
While Spurgeon et al.[63] ask if it is medical leadership or medical engagement that is needed
for better performance, we suggest that medical engagement is intimately dependent on the
quality of medical leadership. The virtuous cycle of medical leadership illustrates how
medical leadership can intervene at the individual, organizational and system levels to
enhance medical engagement. At the individual level, medical leaders can explicitly use their
medical knowledge to interpret and explain the medical consequences of managerial
decisions.[73] This would demonstrate commitment to improve health care, model an
integrative view of management and medicine, and subsequently, enhance professional
identities. At the organizational level, medical leaders should formalize recruitment processes,
get top management teams to acknowledge and engage medical expertise and academic
competence, and embed leadership development in medical practice through quality

improvement. Finally, the highest level of medical leadership, including political decision
makers, need to develop an inclusive and collaborative culture characterized by openness,
trust, and respect, by engaging health professionals in the design and monitoring of
performance measures. These combined efforts will not only cultivate medical engagement
and by that improve the performance of individual health care organizations. They will also
enable a shift to new leadership paradigms suitable to the complexity of health care,[74] and
establish conditions favorable for large-system transformation and health care reform.[75]
In terms of future research, the field of medical leadership would benefit from studies
conducted in primary care, include leaders at other than senior managerial levels, and from
non-Anglo-American settings. While we came across a few studies on gender balance and
internationalization of the clinical workforce, perspectives on the consequences for medical
leadership are lacking. Qualitative studies could further deepen our understanding of the
relationship between management and medicine in everyday clinical practice in order to
inform leadership development and human resource management efforts. Finally, this review
alludes to a need to design and evaluate medical leadership development programs that are
theory-based, evidence-informed, and organizationally embedded.
This review is limited by the quality and heterogeneity of included studies. Quality appraisal
of the individual studies in terms of strength of evidence was not conducted due to the
reviews broad focus which lead to significant diversity of research designs. Since the search
was timebound to capture contemporary evidence and limited to three databases, we cannot
guarantee that all relevant articles were found. While plausible correlations between
conditions and performance outcomes are explored, to establish causality requires other
approaches to test and determine the strength of the relationships.

CONCLUSION
The identification of the virtuous or vicious cycles of medical leadership can help us better
understand how medical leadership can be both a boon or a barrier to the positive impact that
health care organizations desire for their patients, staff, and society. We can choose to either
create willing leaders through medical engagement or accept incidental leaders through
medical protectionism. This complex challenge involves questioning conventional wisdom on
management and medicine in favor of more participative practices that require long-term
investments at the individual, organizational, and system levels.
