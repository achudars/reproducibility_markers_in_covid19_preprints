Abstract
Objectives:
To evaluate proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and T2* measurements of the liver
with combined parallel imaging (sensitivity encoding, SENSE) and compressed
sensing (CS) accelerated chemical shift encoding-based water-fat separation.
Methods:
Six-echo Dixon imaging was performed in the liver of 89 subjects. The first
acquisition variant used acceleration based on SENSE with a total acceleration factor
equal to 2.64 (acquisition labeled as SENSE). The second acquisition variant used
acceleration based on a combination of CS with SENSE with a total acceleration
factor equal to 4 (acquisition labeled as CS+SENSE). Acquisition times were
compared between acquisitions and proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and T2*values were measured and compared separately for each liver segment.
Results:
Total scan duration was 14.5 sec for the SENSE accelerated image acquisition and
9.3 sec for the CS+SENSE accelerated image acquisition. PDFF and T2* values did
not differ significantly between the two acquisitions (paired Mann-Whitney and paired
t-test P>0.05 in all cases). CS+SENSE accelerated acquisition showed reduced
motion artifacts (1.1%) compared to SENSE acquisition (12.3%).
Conclusion:
CS+SENSE accelerates liver PDFF and T2*mapping while retaining the same
quantitative values as an acquisition using only SENSE and reduces motion artifacts.

Strengths of this study:
•

Compressed sensing allows accelerated imaging with reduction of motion
artifacts without alteration of quantitative measurements

•

Robust results in fat and iron quantification in a heterogeneous patient cohort

Limitations of this study:
•

No histopathological validation of the MR findings was performed

•

The study was not performed at different field strengths

Introduction
The non-invasive quantification of fat and iron content in liver tissue is of high clinical
significance. For example, Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the most
common cause of chronic liver disease worldwide

1

, with a prevalence of

approximately 30% in adults in the western world 2. In patients with NAFLD, liver
damage results in hyperferritinemia and hepatic iron accumulation

34

. Both hepatic

iron overload and steatosis can result in fibrosis, progress to cirrhosis and therefore
carry an increased risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma 5. Despite
availability of non-invasive imaging methods for quantification of hepatic fat and iron
content, invasive tissue biopsy and histopathologic visualization of the fat deposition
remains the gold standard in detection and quantification of hepatic steatosis and
iron overload 6-12.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides tools for fast, non-invasive quantitative
imaging. Specifically, multi-echo gradient-echo acquisitions enable the simultaneous
spatially-resolved mapping of the proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and T2*. Liver
PDFF has emerged as a method for quantification of intrahepatic fat

13-17

with high

sensitivity and specificity of 95.0% and 100.0% for the detection of histologic
steatosis

13

. Due to its high diagnostic performance, PDFF is used as a reference

modality for other methods of image-based fat quantification like computed
tomography

18

. Likewise, liver T2* mapping has emerged as a method for

quantification of intrahepatic iron content

19

. Chemical shift encoding-based water-fat

separation by multi-echo gradient echo acquisition enables the simultaneous
accurate and precise quantification of liver PDFF and T2*.

Parallel imaging has been traditionally used to reduce acquisition times, enabling
chemical shift encoding-based water-fat separation measurements in a single breathhold. However, further reduction of the breath-hold duration is highly desirable to
avoid motion artefacts and thus improve accuracy of non-invasive fat and iron
quantification, especially in patients with difficulty holding their breath. Compressed
sensing (CS) allows for acceleration of MRI sequences and has been successfully
utilized in various applications

20-22

. Some methodological works have employed CS

for PDFF mapping and applied the technique in small volunteer or patient samples

26

. However, few studies exist on the performance of CS for simultaneous PDFF and

T2* mapping in larger patient cohorts.

Therefore, the purpose of this study was the evaluation of the robustness of an CSaccelerated multi-echo gradient echo acquisition for the quantification of hepatic fat
and iron content compared to a standard parallel-imaging-accelerated multi-echo
gradient echo acquisition in a larger patient cohort.

Material and Methods
Approval by the institutional ethics committee (180/17S, Ethikkommission der
Fakultät für Medizin der Technischen Universität München) was received for the
study. The requirement to obtain written informed consent for retrospective data
analysis was waived. All analyses were carried out in compliance with the pertinent
regulations and requirements.
Patient and Public Involvement.
We did not involve patients or the public in our work
Patient cohort
We considered 217 datasets of patients who underwent routine clinical liver MRI
examination from January 2018 until August 2018 for inclusion in the study. Datasets
of patients with primary or secondary/metastatic liver tumors (N=128) were excluded.
The final patient cohort consisted of 89 patients (39 males and 50 females). Average
patient age was 62.6±16.9 years (range 19-86 years). MRI was performed for the
following indications: evaluation of focal pancreatic lesions (n=57), pancreatitis
(n=15), evaluation of biliary lesions (n=9) and suspected liver lesions (n=8).

Data acquisition
Two variants of multi-echo gradient-echo imaging for performing chemical shift
encoding-based water-fat separation were performed sequentially on each patient at
a 3 T MRI scanner (Philips Ingenia Elition X; Philips Medical Systems, Best, The
Netherlands). The two acquisitions were based on a spoiled gradient echo sequence
using bipolar gradient readouts. The first acquisition variant used acceleration based
on SENSE with a total acceleration factor equal to 2.64 (acquisition labeled as

SENSE). The second acquisition variant used acceleration based on a combination
of CS with SENSE with a total acceleration factor equal to 4 (acquisition labeled as
CS+SENSE). The relevant scan parameters are listed in Table 1.
The CS+SENSE technique used in the present work was based on the combination
of SENSE and CS, labelled as Compressed SENSE or C-SENSE. The technique
uses the coil sensitivity information from a SENSE calibration scan and randomly
undersamples both the central and outer part of k-space, following a smooth
sampling density as moving from the center to outer parts of k-space. The acquisition
and reconstruction were based on the vendor’s implementation (Compressed
SENSE, Philips Healthcare). A single CS acceleration factor was defined for the
CS+SENSE acquisition variant and the sampled k-space pattern (central and outer
part) was defined based on the vendor’s implementation. In order to maintain a
balance between noise reduction and data consistency for CS, an iterative L1minimization reconstruction technique, forcing data fidelity, and image sparsity in the
wavelet domain, was used.
Complex multi-echo gradient-echo images were generated after the SENSE and
CS+SENSE reconstructions and provided as input to the fat quantification routine
provided by the vendor (mDixon Quant, Philips Healthcare). Specifically, after phase
correction, a complex-based water-fat decomposition was performed using a single
T2* correction and a pre-calibrated fat spectrum accounting for the presence of the
multiple peaks in the fat spectrum. A seven-peak fat spectrum model was employed
27

. The PDFF map was computed as the ratio of the fat signal over the sum of fat and

water signals.
Image analysis
Images were reviewed by two abdominal radiologists under standardized radiological
reporting room conditions. Circular regions of interest (ROI) with a diameter of 15mm
were manually drawn in each liver segment in consensus, avoiding large portal vein
and hepatic vein branches (Figure 1). T2* and PDFF maps were reviewed and mean
ROI values and standard deviations were extracted. The software used was Sectra
IDS7 (Linköping, Sweden). Motion artifacts were rated using a 4-point Likert scale
as 1=image not diagnostic because of artifacts; 2=major artifacts; 3=minor artifacts;
4=no artifacts.

Statistical analysis
Variables were tested for normal distribution using the D’Agostino-Pearson omnibus
K2 test. Student’s t-test was used for mean comparisons of normally distributed
variables. The Wilcoxon test was used for mean comparisons of variables without
normal distribution. All analyses were performed using Prism Version 7 (GraphPad
Software). A two-tailed P-value below 0.05 was considered statistically significant.

Results
The use of CS+SENSE accelerated image acquisition by 35% compared to the
SENSE acquisition (from 14.5 to 9.3 seconds). Mean PDFF values ranged from 4.94
± 5.8% (liver segment IVb) to 6.37 ± 6.65% (liver segment VII) in the acquisition with
SENSE and from 5.00 ± 6.32% (liver segment IVb) to 6.28 ± 6.10% (liver segment
VII) in the acquisition with CS+SENSE. Results did not differ significantly between
the two acquisitions. All values are shown in Table 2. Mean PDFF was significantly
higher in the right liver lobe compared to the left in both acquisitions (right lobe: 6.04
± 6.36%; left lobe: 5.24 ± 5.69%; P=0.03; acquisition with SENSE and right lobe: 5.96
± 6.30%; left lobe: 5.16 ± 5.74%; P=0.02; acquisition with CS+SENSE).
Mean T2* values ranged from 20.54±7.05 ms (liver segment II) to 23.42±7.43 ms
(liver segment V) in the acquisition with SENSE and from 21.29±8.24 ms (liver
segment II) to 23.30±8.60 ms (liver segment IVb) in the acquisition with CS+SENSE.
T2* values did not differ significantly between the two acquisitions. T2* values with
inter-patient standard deviation and results of the mean comparison are shown in
Table 3. T2* values showed no significant difference between the right and left liver
lobe in both acquisitions (right lobe: 22.60 ± 7.28ms; left lobe: 21.70 ± 7.14ms;
P=0.08 in the acquisition with SENSE; right lobe: 22.65 ± 7.31ms; left lobe: 22.14 ±
7.94ms; P=0.35; in the acquisition with CS+SENSE). Images acquired with SENSE
showed minor motion artifacts in 10.1% (n=9) and major motion artifacts in 2.2%
(n=2) of the cases. Images acquired with CS+SENSE showed minor motion artifacts
in 1.1% (n=1) of all cases. One exemplary case with hepatic steatosis, sparing
segment I is shown in Figure 2. Figure 3 shows a patient with segmental steatosis. A
T2 weighted image and a CT-image, acquired in the portal venous phase are shown
as a comparison. Figure 4 shows a case of a patient with hepatic iron overload due
to hemosiderosis.

Discussion
The data presented in this study show comparability of quantitative PDFF and T2*
measurements acquired with compressed sensing (CS)-accelerated chemical shift
encoding-based water-fat separation. Our results demonstrate a significantly higher
PDFF in the right lobe of the liver, which is in accordance with other studies

28 29

, and

no spatial dependence of liver T2* values.
The most important finding of the presented data is the agreement of the quantitative
PDFF and T2* imaging results between the two acquisitions. Several studies have
shown high accuracy of MRI-based imaging techniques for the non-invasive
quantification of fat and iron content of the liver

13 14 29

. Due to their widespread

availability, chemical shift encoding-based water-fat separation techniques can be
used as a fast screening for NAFLD or disorders of iron metabolism. Given the
increase of medical imaging in the last years

30

, the acquisition time is an essential

factor. In our study, CS+SENSE was able to accelerate image acquisition of liver
PDFF and T2* mapping by 35% to a scan time of only 9.3 seconds. In a liver
segment-based comparison between the acquisition with CS+SENSE and the
acquisition with SENSE, no significant differences were detected in the quantitative
parameters PDFF and T2*. Thus, reduction of scan time lead to a reduction of motion
artifacts and did not lead to changes in quantitative parameters, rendering the
presented chemical shift encoding-based water-fat separation technique combined
with CS+SENSE a sequence with an excellent applicability in routine MRI liver
examinations. The widespread availability could allow an application for large studies
on hepatic steatosis.
Previous methodological works applied CS for the joint problem of image
reconstruction and water-fat separation

23-25

. The present work estimates the PDFF

and T2* maps in two steps: it first applies the CS+SENSE reconstruction for the
reconstruction of the multi-echo complex images and then applies water-fat
separation on the reconstructed water-fat images, as also previously performed

26 31

.

Although higher acceleration factors can be achieved by solving the joint step instead
of solving the problem in two steps, the present study shows that a prospective
CS+SENSE accelerated acquisition using the two-step approach already results in
reliable PDFF and T2* maps in the presently studied patient cohort.

Our study has some limitations. First, the study was only performed in one center
and on one scanner to show the feasibility of the accelerated acquisition with
CS+SENSE. We did not test the two acquisitions at different field strengths. Second,
histologic correlation was not performed. However, this was not within the scope of
the current study that aimed at showing robustness of quantitative parameters when
using CS acceleration. In addition, several previous studies have already shown high
sensitivity and specificity in liver quantitative imaging with chemical shift encoding
based water-fat separation techniques accounting for the same confounding factors
13 32

.

In conclusion, the acceleration of chemical shift encoding-based water-fat separation
using compressed sensing results in comparable quantitative measurements of
hepatic fat and iron content with reduced breath-hold intervals, leading to reduced
motion artifacts and making chemical shift encoding-based water-fat separation a
fast and precise non-invasive tool in quantitative liver imaging.
