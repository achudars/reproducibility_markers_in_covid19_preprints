ABSTRACT
Each additional copy of the apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) allele is associated with a higher risk of
Alzheimer’s dementia, such that APOE4 homozygotes have a particularly high risk. While the APOE2
allele is associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s dementia, it is not yet known whether APOE2
homozygotes have a particularly low risk. We generated Alzheimer’s dementia odds ratios and other
findings in more than 5,000 clinically characterized and neuropathologically characterized Alzheimer’s
dementia cases and controls. APOE2/2 was associated with exceptionally low Alzheimer’s dementia odds
ratios compared to APOE2/3, 3/3 and 4/4, and the impact of APOE2 and APOE4 gene dose was
significantly greater in the neuropathologically confirmed group than in more than 24,000
neuropathologically unconfirmed cases and controls. Finding and targeting the factors by which APOE
and its variants influence Alzheimer’s disease could have a major impact on the understanding, treatment
and prevention of this terrible disease.

INTRODUCTION
Apolipoprotein E (APOE), the major susceptibility gene for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD), has
three common alleles (APOE2, 3, and 4), giving rise to six genotypes (APOE2/2, 2/3, 3/3, 2/4, 3/4, and
4/4). Compared to the most common APOE3/3 genotype, each additional copy of the APOE4 allele is
associated with a higher risk of Alzheimer’s dementia and a younger mean age at dementia onset, such
that APOE4 homozygotes are at the highest risk, while the presence of one or two copies of the APOE2
allele is associated with a lower risk of Alzheimer’s dementia and an older mean age at dementia onset.1-4
It remains to be clarified whether APOE2 homozygotes have a lower odd than persons with the APOE2/3
genotype—a question we sought to address in an unusually large number of clinically and
neuropathologically classified Alzheimer’s dementia cases and controls.
We (JFA-V, YQ, GRJ, EMR), Francisco Lopera, and our colleagues recently discovered two copies of
the rare APOE3 Christchurch (APOE3ch [Arg136→Ser]) mutation in an amyloid-β42 (Aβ42) overproducing
presenilin 1 (PSEN1) E280A mutation carrier from the world’s largest autosomal dominant AD kindred
who did not develop mild cognitive impairment (MCI) until her seventies, nearly three decades after her
kindred’s mean age at MCI onset.5 Using PET to compare her to other PSEN1 E280A mutation carriers
with MCI, she had the greatest fibrillar amyloid-β (Aβ) burden (the major constituent of neuritic plaques),
limited paired helical filament tau (neurofibrillary tangle) burden, and minimal glucose hypometabolism in
brain regions preferentially affected by AD. Like 5-10% of APOE2 homozygotes, she also had
hyperlipoproteinemia Type III, reflecting reduced ApoE protein low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)
binding.5,6 Like the ApoE2 protein, the ApoEch protein was associated with less Aβ42 aggregation than the
ApoE3 protein in vitro.5,7 These findings led us to postulate that APOE2 homozygotes might have an
exceptionally low risk of late-onset Alzheimer’s dementia.
Why has this possibility remained unaddressed? First, case-control studies without neuropathological
or biomarker assessments of AD may have underestimated the impact of APOE genotypes on
Alzheimer’s dementia odds ratios (ORs) due to the confounding effects of APOE genotypes on the
percentages of neuropathologically misclassified cases and controls.8,9,10 Second, previous studies of
clinically and neuropathologically characterized cases and controls may have been too small to
demonstrate that APOE2 homozygotes have an even lower OR than the relatively low-risk APOE2/3

group due to the paucity of APOE2 homozygotes, who comprise less than 1% of the general
population.1,4
This study sought to establish that APOE2 homozygotes have an exceptionally low likelihood of
Alzheimer’s dementia, demonstrate the value of AD risk assessments in clinically and neuropathologically
characterized cases and controls, and underscore the impact of different APOE genotypes on
Alzheimer’s dementia ORs relative to the lowest risk APOE2/2 and highest risk APOE4/4 genotypes.
More generally, it sought to highlight the impact of discovering and targeting the mechanism by which
APOE variants account for differential risk could have on the understanding, treatment and prevention of
AD, including those interventions that might prevent both the initial development of AD pathology and the
subsequent development of dementia.

RESULTS
Neuropathologically confirmed, unconfirmed, and combined groups
Supplementary Table 1 shows the number of Alzheimer’s dementia cases and cognitively
unimpaired controls for each APOE genotype in a) the ADGC’s clinically characterized and
neuropathologically confirmed autopsy group, b) its clinically characterized but neuropathologically
unconfirmed non-autopsy group, and c) the combined neuropathologically confirmed and unconfirmed
group. The 5,007 participants in the neuropathologically confirmed cohort included 4,018 AD dementia
cases and 989 cognitively unimpaired and neuropathologically unaffected controls. The 23,857
participants in the clinically classified but neuropathologically unconfirmed cohort included 10,430
probable AD dementia cases and 13,426 cognitively unimpaired controls. The 28,864 participants in the
combined group included 14,448 cases and 14,416 controls. Supplementary Table 2 summarizes ages
at dementia onset in the cases, ages at last clinical exam in the cases, and ages at death in the
neuropathologically confirmed autopsy cohort.
Alzheimer’s Dementia ORs
Table 1 and Supplementary Table 3 show Alzheimer’s dementia ORs for each APOE genotype and
allelic doses (i.e., the number of APOE2 alleles in APOE4 non-carriers and number of APOE4 alleles in
APOE2 non-carriers) before and after adjustment for age and sex in the neuropathologically confirmed
and unconfirmed groups before and after adjustment for age and sex, compared to the common

APOE3/3 genotype. As discussed below, APOE2/2, APOE2/3, and APOE2 allelic dose ORs were
significantly lower, and APOE3/4, APOE4/4, and APOE4 allelic dose ORs were significantly higher, in the
neuropathologically confirmed than unconfirmed group. Table 2 shows Alzheimer’s dementia ORs for
each APOE genotype compared to the relatively low risk APOE2/3 and highest risk APOE4 genotypes in
the neuropathologically confirmed cohort. As discussed below, these ORs permitted us to confirm our
primary hypothesis that APOE2/2 is associated with a significantly lower OR compared to APOE2/2 and
to demonstrate an exceptionally low OR compared to APOE4/4. Supplementary Table 4 shows
Alzheimer’s dementia ORs for each APOE genotype in the combined group, compared to APOE3/3, and
for APOE2 and APOE4 allelic dose before and after adjustment for age, sex, and autopsy/non-autopsy
group.

Impact of APOE2 homozygosity. As shown in Tables 1 and 2, APOE2 homozygotes had a
significantly lower 0.34 OR (95% CI=0.12-0.95) compared to the relatively low-risk APOE2/3 genotype, an
extremely low 0.13 OR (95% CI 0.05-0.36) compared to the most common APOE3/3 genotype; and an
exceptionally low 0.004 OR (95% CI 0.001-0.014) compared to the highest risk APOE4/4 genotype.
APOE2 homozygotes had more modest but significantly lower ORs compared to APOE3/3 in both the
clinical group (0.52 OR [95% CI=0.30-0.90] and (not shown) in the combined group (0.41 OR [95%
CI=0.25-0.66], P=3x10-4). As shown in Supplementary Table 3, ORs for each APOE genotype,
compared to APOE3/3, were not significantly affected in the neuropathologically confirmed or
unconfirmed group after adjustment for age and sex.

Impact of APOE2 allelic dose. As shown in Table 1, APOE2 allelic dose in APOE4 non-carriers was
associated with significantly lower ORs in both the neuropathologically confirmed and unconfirmed
groups, and with significantly lower ORs in the confirmed than unconfirmed group (P=6x10-4). Using an
additive genetic model, ORs in the neuropathologically confirmed (0.38 OR [95% CI=0.30-0.48] P=1x1015),

unconfirmed (0.64 OR [95% CI=0.58-0.72] P=2x10-16), and combined groups (0.59 OR [95% CI=0.53-

0.65] P=9x10-27) were similar to the corresponding APOE2/3 ORs relative to APOE3/3. As shown in
Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, findings were not significantly affected after adjustment for age, sex,
and neuropathologically confirmed autopsy/unconfirmed non-autopsy group. Using the resulting beta
estimates, the 0.14 OR in the neuropathologically confirmed APOE2 homozygotes was similar to the 0.13

OR shown in Table 1.

Impact of other APOE genotypes. As previously noted, compared to APOE3/3, APOE2/2 and 2/3
genotypes were associated with significantly lower Alzheimer’s dementia ORs, and APOE3/4 and 4/4
genotypes were associated with significantly higher ORs, in the neuropathologically confirmed than
unconfirmed or combined groups than in the neuropathologically unconfirmed or combined groups (P<104).

APOE2/4, APOE3/4, and APOE4/4 genotypes in the neuropathologically confirmed autopsy group

were associated with 2.68, 6.13, and 31.22 ORs, respectively, compared to the most common APOE3/3
genotype; 20.33, 46.51, and 236.74, respectively, compared to the lowest risk APOE2/2 genotype; and
0.09, 0.20, and 1.00, respectively, compared to the highest odds APOE4/4 genotype. These results
underscore the impact of APOE and its common APOE genotypes on the differential associations of
Alzheimer’s dementia, the progressively harmful or protective molecular mechanisms that may account
for these differences, and the importance of discovering interventions to safely and sufficiently target
those factors to the treatment and prevention of AD. As we predicted from the likely inclusion of
neuropathologically misclassified cases and controls in the clinical group, APOE3/4 and 4/4 ORs were
significantly lower than those in the neuropathologically confirmed autopsy group and roughly comparable
to those from numerous case-control studies in which neuropathological (or biomarker) measurements
were not required to confirm the presence or absence of AD.1 APOE2/4, 3/4, and 4/4 Alzheimer’s
dementia ORs relative to APOE3/3 were 2.47, 3.55, and 10.70, in the neuropathologically unconfirmed
group (Table 1), and 2.47, 3.78, and 12.02 in the combined group (Supplementary Table 4),
respectively.

Impact of APOE4 allelic dose. As shown in Table 1 and Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, APOE4
allelic dose in APOE2 non-carriers

was associated

with significantly greater ORs in the

neuropathologically confirmed autopsy, neuropathologically unconfirmed clinical, and combined groups.
Using an additive genetic model, ORs in the neuropathologically confirmed (6.00 OR [95% CI=5.06-7.12]
P=3X10-90), unconfirmed (3.43 OR [95% CI=3.26-3.60] P<1X10-300), and combined group (3.61 OR [95%
CI=3.37-3.87] P=2X10-290) were similar to corresponding APOE3/4 OR relative to APOE3/3. As shown in
Supplementary Tables 3 and 4, findings were not significantly different after adjustment for age or sex in
the neuropathologically confirmed or unconfirmed group or after adjustment for age, sex, or

neuropathologically confirmed autopsy/unconfirmed non-autopsy group. Using the resulting beta
estimates, the 36.0 OR in the neuropathologically confirmed APOE4 homozygotes was similar to the 31.2
OR shown in Table 1.

Impact of neuropathologically confirmed autopsy versus unconfirmed non-group on ORs. We
originally postulated that APOE2 and APOE4 allelic dose would have a more profound impact on
Alzheimer’s dementia ORs in neuropathologically confirmed than unconfirmed cases and controls due to
the exclusion of clinically diagnosed cases who did not meet neuropathological criteria for AD and
unimpaired controls who met criteria for (preclinical) AD, which could dilute OR estimates in the
unconfirmed group; and to known differences between APOE4 carriers and non-carriers in the
neuropathological classification of cases (more likely in APOE4 non-carriers) and controls (more likely in
APOE4 carriers), which could lead to systematically underestimation ORs in the unconfirmed group.
Since the ADGC does not have information from most of the neuropathologically misclassified cases and
controls, it is not possible to clarify whether the more profound impact of different APOE genotypes and
allelic doses on Alzheimer’s dementia ORs is solely attributable to the exclusion of neuropathologically
misclassified cases and controls or also on participation in a brain donation program. As previously noted,
ORs for each APOE genotype and allelic dose were not significantly different after adjustment for
neuropathologically confirmed autopsy/unconfirmed non-autopsy group.

Impact of APOE2 and APOE4 allelic dose on the classification of cases and controls. A
sensitivity analysis was performed to clarify the impact of age, sex, and neuropathologically confirmed
autopsy/unconfirmed autopsy group on the accuracy to classify cases and controls. The Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curves in Supplementary Figure 1 show the impact of APOE2 and
APOE4 allelic doses on the classification of cases and controls in the neuropathologically confirmed
autopsy and unconfirmed non-autopsy groups. APOE2 and APOE4 allelic doses were each associated
with significantly greater Areas Under the Curve (AUC), an indicator of classification accuracy, in the
neuropathologically confirmed and unconfirmed groups, and APOE4 allelic dose had a greater impact
than APOE2 allelic dose on AUCs in both groups, as reflected by the variance importance scores, below.
APOE2 allelic dose was associated with a significantly greater AUC in the neuropathologically confirmed

autopsy than unconfirmed non-autopsy group (AUC 0.68 [95%CI 0.65-70 versus 0.58 [95%CI 0.50-0.65]),
corresponding to variance importance scores of 24.0 versus 9.0, respectively. AUCs for APOE4 allelic
dose were not significantly different in the neuropathologically confirmed autopsy and non-autopsy
groups, as reflected by AUC 0.77 (95%CI 0.75-79) versus 0.75 (95%CI 0.74-0.77) and corresponding
variance importance scores of 43.9 and 32.3.

Impact of APOE genotypes and allelic doses on four other neuropathological disease ORs
Other neuropathological diseases are relatively common in older adults with and without Alzheimer’s
dementia. Supplementary Table 5 shows the number of persons in the neuropathologically confirmed
case-control group with and without four commonly assessed neuropathological diagnoses, including
congophilic amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy Body Disease (LBD), Vascular Brain Injury (VBI), and
hippocampal sclerosis (HS). (Since TDP-43 pathology and microinfarcts were not characterized in many
of the participants, they were not included in our analysis.) CAA, LBD, VBI, and HS were present in 94,
88, 78, and 83% of the Alzheimer’s dementia cases and 70, 22, 12, and 14% of the unimpaired non-AD
controls. Supplementary Tables 6 and 7 show CAA, LBD, VBI, and HS ORs for each APOE genotype,
compared to APOE3/3, and for allelic dose, before and after adjustment for age, sex, and the
neuropathological diagnosis of AD. APOE2 allelic dose was not associated with a significantly lower OR
for any of these diseases, before or after adjustment for presence or absence of AD. While APOE4 allelic
dose was not significantly associated with significantly higher VBI and HS ORs, it was associated with
significantly higher CAA and LBD ORs, before and after adjustment for age, sex, and presence or
absence of AD.

Impact of APOE genotypes on ages at dementia onset
The estimated mean ages at Alzheimer’s dementia onset for each genotype shown in
Supplementary Table 2 are consistent with previously reported findings. In neuropathologically
confirmed Alzheimer’s dementia cases with available onset ages, APOE4/4, 3/4, 2/4, 3/3, and combined
2/3 and 2/2 genotypes were associated with progressively older ages at Alzheimer’s dementia onset,
ranging from 69.9 ± 6.1 years in the APOE4/4 genotype to 79.3±9.0 years in the combined APOE2/3 and
2/2 group. In the neuropathologically unconfirmed and combined cases, APOE4/4, 3/4, 2/4, 3/3, and
combined 2/3 and 2/2 genotypes were also associated with progressively older ages at Alzheimer’s

dementia onset, ranging from 69.5±5.9 years in the combined APOE4/4 homozygote group to 77.7±8.5
years in the combined APOE2/3 and 2/2 group. The Kaplan-Meier curves in Figure 1 show the
percentage of persons in the neuropathologically confirmed case-control group with each APOE
genotype, including APOE2/2, who remained free from Alzheimer’s dementia at different ages. While
there was some overlap between the 95% CIs in the APOE2/2 and 2/3 plots due to the small size of and
relatively large CI for the APOE2/2 group, the Kaplan-Meier plots in Figure 1 confirmed a relationship
between APOE2 allelic dose and freedom from Alzheimer’s dementia survival at older ages.
Impact of APOE genotypes on neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle severity
Supplementary Table 8 and Supplementary Figure 2, provide information about CERAD (neuritic
Aβ plaque) scores and Braak (tau tangle) stage in the neuropathologically verified case-control group.
APOE genotype (APOE2/2<2/3<3/3<2/4<3/4<4/4) (and consequently allelic dose) were associated with
greater Aβ plaque and tau tangle severity, before and after adjustment for age at death and sex. Our
findings could be attributable to the proportion of cases to controls in each genetic group, their direct or
indirect impact on these neuropathological features, potentially confounding differential effects of AD
onset and duration on Braak stage, or a combination of these and other factors. While the difference
between CERAD scores in the small APOE2/2 and 2/3 groups were not significant (1.05±1.10 versus
1.33±1.31, P=0.35), APOE2 homozygotes were distinguished from the APOE2/3 group by a significantly
lower Braak stage (2.26±1.63 versus 3.16±1.69, P<0.05), before and after adjustment for age and sex.
Compared to the APOE3/3 group, the APOE2/2 and APOE2/3 groups had significantly lower CERAD
scores and Braak stages, and the APOE2/4, 3/4, and 4/4 genotypes had significantly higher CERAD
scores and Braak stages, before and after adjustment for age at death and sex.
Residual effects of each APOE genotype on Braak stage, relative to APOE2/2, 3/3, and 4/4, after
controlling CERAD scores are depicted in terms of beta (linear regression) coefficients in Table 3.
Relatively protective or harmful effects are reflected by negative or positive beta coefficients, respectively.
Compared to APOE2/3 or APOE3/3, only the APOE3/4 and 4/4 genotypes demonstrated progressively
harmful residual effects on Braak stage. Compared to APOE4/4, the APOE2/2, 2/3, 3/3, 2/4, and 3/4
genotypes had significant and progressively protective residual effects on Braak stage with beta
coefficients of -1.32, -0.43, -0.25, -0.26, and -0.10, respectively (P<0.05), such that the protective effect

was more than three times greater in the APOE2/2 than APOE2/3 group. This finding supports the
possibility that APOE variants have differential effects on tau tangle severity, even after controlling for
neuritic Aβ plaque severity.

DISCUSSION
This study demonstrates an exceptionally low likelihood of Alzheimer’s dementia in APOE2
homozygotes in a large group of clinically and neuropathologically characterized cases and controls. The
large number of cases and controls in the neuropathologically unconfirmed and combined groups enabled
us to demonstrate a significantly greater impact of APOE2/2, 2/3, 3/3, 3/4, and 4/4 genotypes on
Alzheimer’s dementia ORs in the neuropathologically confirmed group—and to suggest that the greater
impact may be attributable to the exclusion of cases without significant AD neuropathology, as well as the
exclusion of controls with preclinical AD neuropathology.11 This study provides updated ORs for
Alzheimer’s dementia for each of the six common APOE genotypes, APOE2 allelic dose, and APOE4
allelic dose on , on the differential risk of Alzheimer’s dementia., free from the confounding effects of
clinically misdiagnosed cases and controls, and it demonstrates an additional impact of APOE4 but not
APOE2 allelic dose on two other neuropathological disease (CAA and DLB) ORs. The study supports
known effects of APOE genotypes on standard measures of neuritic Aβ plaque and tau tangle severity12
and suggests progressively protective residual effects on Braak stage in APOE3/4, 2/4, 3/3, 2/3, and 2/2
groups compared to APOE4/4 homozygotes.
The APOE2/2 genotype was associated with a significantly lower 0.34 Alzheimer’s dementia OR

compared to the most common APOE3/3 genotype (95% CI 0.05-0.36), and an exceptionally low 0.004
OR compared to the highest odds APOE4/4 genotype (95% CI 0.001-0.014) in those neuropathologically
confirmed subjects. In other words, persons with the APOE2/2 genotype had a 66% lower OR than those
with the APOE2/3 genotype, 87% lower than those with the APOE3/3 genotype, and 99.6% (95% CI 98.699.9%) lower than those with APOE4/4 group. These findings highlight the impact of APOE and its
variants on the risk of AD and the potential impact of APOE-modifying interventions on its treatment and
prevention.

primary tauopathies, including progressive supranuclear palsy, corticobasal degeneration, and a mouse
model of human tau over-expression.13 On the other hand, APOE2/2 and APOE3/3ch genotypes could be
associated with less severe tau pathology in AD (a secondary tauopathy) due to a direct or indirect (e.g.,
amyloid and neuroinflammation-mediated) effects, as noted above. While the current study did not assess
the impact of APOE2 allelic dose on ORs for these primary tauopathies, it found no association between
APOE2 allele dose and ORs for four other disease (CAA, DLB, VBI, and HS). In contrast, APOE4 allelic
dose was associated with significantly higher ORs for CAA and DLB, before and after adjustment for the
presence or absence of AD, and not with VBI or HS.
As previously noted, we and our colleagues recently found as association between two copies of the
rare APOE3ch mutation and resistance to the clinical onset of AD in an Aβ42-overproducing PSEN1
E280A mutation carrier from the world’s largest autosomal dominant AD kindred.5 Interestingly, this
individual had unusually high PET measurements of Aβ plaque burden, relatively limited PET
measurements of paired helical filament tau (neurofibrillary tangle) burden, minimal cerebral glucose
hypometabolism in AD-affected brain regions, and like some APOE2 homozygotes, Type III
hyperlipoproteinemia.5,6 We postulate that the contributions of APOE and its variants to the differential
risk of Alzheimer’s dementia are not solely attributable to their impact on the density of Aβ plaques but
also to their direct or indirect impact on downstream pathogenic events. In experimental studies, the
ApoEch protein was associated with reduced Aβ42 aggregation and a differential impact of ApoE isoforms
(ApoE4>3>2>>3ch) on heparin binding and demonstrated the ability of a targeted antibody to lower
wildtype ApoE3 binding to heparin.5 Based on studies implicating heparin sulfate polyglycan (HSPG) on
Aβ aggregation, Aβ-mediated microglial response, the neuronal uptake and potential propagation of tau,14
and neurodegeneration, we postulated that the ApoE binding to HSPG could have potential roles in the
pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of AD.5
Together our APOE2/2 and APOE3ch/3ch studies underscore the need to clarify and target the
factors by which APOE and its variants account for this differential risk, treatment and prevention of AD. It
remains to be shown whether the differential effects of APOE variants on the risk of Alzheimer’s dementia
are related to their recognized effects on Aβ oligomerization, morphology, or clearance, their suggested
effects on TREM2-mediated microglial response or tau pathology, low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR)

binding, HSPG binding, mitochondrial function, neurodegeneration, or a combination of these and other
effects.5,7,15-20 It also remains to be shown whether it would help to increase or, as some of us suggest,
decrease ApoE expression in brain.
APOE, its variants, and the right APOE-modifying treatments could influence Aβ oligomerization or
clearance, the morphology of Aβ aggregates, TREM2-mediated neuroinflammation, development or
spread of tau pathology, mitochondrial function, neurodegeneration, or a combination of these or other
processes. For instance, like their loss-of-function effects on LDLR binding, heparin sulfate polyglutamate
(HSPG) binding, and Aβ oligomerization,5-7 a non-additive protective effect of APOE2 in reducing the
expression of a microglial aging signature (HuMi Aged geneset),21 APOE2 variants might be associated
with a relative loss in one or more functions that are critically involved in the development of AD. If so,

(APOE4/4>3/4>2/4>3/3>2/3>2/2 and APOEch/ch>no APOE). We postulate that genetic, drug or immune
treatments that safely and sufficiently inhibit the expression of APOE or its relevant functions in brain
might have a significant impact on the treatment and prevention of AD. Evidence from a person without
APOE function due to homozygosity for an ablative APOE frameshift mutation22 and the availability of
dyslipidemia treatments support the potential tolerability of this approach. Additional research is needed
to clarify the mechanisms by which homozygosity for APOE2 and APOEch are associated with an
exceptionally low risk of AD dementia, Gene editing, protein-reducing, protein-modifying, or other
treatments that safely and sufficiently replicate protective effects of the APOE2/2 genotypes could help to
prevent the clinical onset of AD.
The study has several limitations. First, while the unusually large number of participants in the overall
study, there was a relatively small number of APOE2 homozygotes. Despite the resulting limitation in
statistical power, it did not prevent us from demonstrating significant effects in association with the
APOE2/2 genotype and APOE2 allelic dose. Second, as previously noted, since we do not have
information from most of the participating brain banks’ neuropathologically misclassified cases and
controls, we are not able to clarify with the more profound impact of different APOE genotypes and allelic
doses on Alzheimer’s dementia ORs is solely attributable to the exclusion of neuropathologically
misclassified cases and controls or also to any ascertain biases related to participation in a brain donation
program. However, we were able to quantify and distinguish the impact of APOE2 versus APOE4 allelic

doses on the classification of cases and controls in both the neuropathologically confirmed and
unconfirmed groups.) Third, we cannot exclude an impact of differential disease onset, duration, or
survival on Alzheimer’s dementia ORs and measures of AD pathology. Fourth, findings from our NonHispanic White groups cannot yet be extended to other ethnic and racial groups.4
Prospective cohort studies that include persons irrespective of their cognitive stage or
neuropathological diagnosis are needed to clarify the absolute lifetime risk of neuropathologically
confirmed Alzheimer’s dementia for each APOE genotype. Similarly, neuropathological studies that
include brain donors irrespective of their cognitive stage or neuropathological diagnosis are needed to
further clarify the impact of APOE2 gene dose on tau pathology and neurodegeneration, including the
extent to which this impact is or is not mediated through its effect on Aβ pathology.8,23 Since the reported
prevalence and impact of different APOE genotypes on Alzheimer’s dementia risk depends in part on
age, race, ethnicity, geographic location, education, and dementia severity, these estimates are likely to
vary in different populations. Based on our selection criteria, this study does not provide information about
the percentage of APOE genotypes in cognitively unimpaired persons with neuropathological or
biomarker evidence of preclinical AD, the percentage of persons who met criteria for MCI with or without
neuropathological or biomarker evidence of AD, or the percentage of persons with a primary diagnosis of
other neurodegenerative disorders. The impact of different APOE genotypes on estimated ages at
Alzheimer’s dementia onset may have been greater if standardized prospective assessments had been
used to estimate onset ages at every site, if the study included more research participants who developed
Alzheimer’s dementia at younger ages (e.g., preferentially reducing onset ages in the APOE4 carrier
groups), and if it included more participants who developed Alzheimer’s dementia at the oldest ages, e.g.,
preferentially increasing ages onset ages in the APOE4 non-carrier groups.
This study supports the complementary value of risk factor assessments in large neuropathologically
confirmed autopsy and even larger neuropathologically unconfirmed clinical groups. In a previous autopsy
study, we found that 25% of persons with the clinical diagnosis of mild-to-moderate Alzheimer’s dementia
lacked at least moderately frequent neuritic plaques, one of the cardinal features of AD, including 37% of
APOE4 non-carriers and 13% of carriers, findings that are consistent with those in living patients.9,10 In a
meta-analysis of brain imaging studies, about 25% of cognitively unimpaired older adults have brain
imaging evidence consistent with at least moderately frequent plaques. By investigating clinically

characterized cases who are confirmed to have AD to unimpaired controls who are confirmed to be free
of AD, it may be possible to address potentially confounding effects of the risk factor on the presence or
absence of AD and underscore the potential impact of an intervention to prevent both AD and its clinical
consequences. By investigating an even larger number of cases and controls without biological
confirmation, it may be possible to clarify risk factors without potentially confounding effects on the
underlying disease with improved statistical power and greater generalizability to understudied
populations. Brain imaging and fluid biomarkers have the potential increase the size and generalizability
of findings in case-control studies of AD.
Additional research is needed to clarify the mechanism by which APOE, and its variants contribute to
the pathogenesis and potential treatment and prevention of AD. There is a critical need to discover
treatments that account for impact of genotypes on the differential risk of Alzheimer’s dementia, including
those that may account for a profound resistance to Alzheimer’s dementia in APOE2 and APOEch
homozygotes, and to establish their value in the treatment and prevention of AD.
In conclusion, homozygosity for the APOE2 allele appears to be associated with an exceptionally low
likelihood of AD dementia, APOE genotypes have an extraordinary impact on Alzheimer’s dementia ORs,

and treatments that target APOE and its variants could have an extraordinary impact on the treatment and
prevention of this terrible disease.

METHODS
Subjects
Our primary analysis capitalized on data from 5,007 brain donors in the ADGC’s “neuropathologically
confirmed autopsy group” including 4,018 cases who met clinical and neuropathological criteria for
Alzheimer’s dementia and 989 cognitively unimpaired controls who did not meet neuropathological criteria
for AD; 5 of the cases and 19 of the controls had the APOE2/2 genotype. There were 283 brain donors in
the ADGC’s “neuropathologically misclassified autopsy group” including 123 cases who met clinical
criteria for probable Alzheimer’s dementia but not meet neuropathological criteria for AD and 160
unimpaired controls who met neuropathological criteria for AD. The entire autopsy group consisted of
unrelated cases and controls. The ADGC’s “neuropathologically unconfirmed clinical group” contained
23,857 living research participants including 10,430 cases who met clinical criteria for probable
Alzheimer’s dementia and 13,427 cognitively unimpaired controls; and the combined (overall autopsy and
clinical subjects) group contained 29,147 research participants including 14,571 cases and 14,576
controls. Data from the neuropathologically confirmed autopsy group were used in our primary analyses;
data from the other groups were in post hoc comparisons with that autopsy group. Due to the prioritized
ascertainment of those cases who met clinical and neuropathological criteria for Alzheimer’s dementia
and those unimpaired controls without AD, the number of misclassified cases and controls available
through the AD Genetics Consortium12 is much smaller than our estimated number of neuropathologically
misclassified cases and controls,8-11 limiting our ability to clarify the impact of brain donation on APOE
ORs in our post-hoc analyses. The number of cases and controls for each APOE genotype in the ADGC’s
neuropathologically confirmed autopsy group, neuropathologically misclassified autopsy group,
neuropathologically unconfirmed clinical group, and combined autopsy and clinical group is shown in
Supplementary Table 1.

Phenotypic Evaluation
Brain samples, extracted DNA, and demographic, clinical and neuropathological data from clinically
and neuropathologically characterized brain donors were assembled by the AD Genetics Consortium
(ADGC) in conjunction with past and present National Institute on Aging (NIA)-sponsored AD Centers,
Banner Sun Health Research Institute and the Translational Genomics Research Institute (TGen), the
Adult Changes in Thought Study (ACT), the University of Miami’s Brain Endowment Bank and Hussman
Institute for Human Genomics, the Late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease Family Study, the Religious Orders
Study and Memory Aging Project (ROS-MAP), the Vanderbilt University Center for Human Genetics
Research, and the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC); APOE genotypes were
characterized at the National Cellular Repository for AD (NCRAD) or TGen. Neuritic plaque burden was
scored using the Consortium to Establish a Registry for AD (CERAD) 0-3 point (none, sparse, moderate,
or frequent plaque) rating system, the spatial extent of neurofibrillary tangle (paired helical filament [PHF]
tau) burden was scored using the Braak 0-VI staging system, and neuropathological data were reviewed
and harmonized by a single neuropathologist (Thomas Montine).12 Neuropathological data in the autopsy
group was collected at each site according to consensus guidelines at the time of brain autopsy. Cases
with neuropathologic evidence of disease other than AD neuropathologic change, with or without common
co-morbid lesions, were excluded. CERAD score, which provide an indicator of neuritic (Aβ) plaque
severity, and Braak stage, which provides an indicator of neurofibrillary (tau) tangle spatial extent and
severity, were available in every participant in the ADGC’s neuropathologically confirmed case-control
autopsy group. Data regarding the presence or absence of four other neuropathological diagnoses
commonly found in persons with AD, including congophilic amyloid angiopathy (CAA), Lewy body disease
(LBD), vascular brain injury (VBI), and hippocampal sclerosis (HS) was most of the participants. Since
TDP-43 proteinopathy and microinfarcts were not available in most of the brain donors (many of whom
came to autopsy prior to development of TDP-43 proteinopathy), these neuropathological diseases were
not included in our analysis. CAA, LBD, VBI, and HS were present in 84, 43, 38, and 21% of the brain
donors, including Alzheimer’s dementia cases and unimpaired non-AD controls.

The Alzheimer’s dementia cases met DSM-IV or NINCDS/ADRDA criteria for dementia24 and, when
available, had Clinical Diagnostic Ratings (CDRs) greater than zero before they died;25 they either met

NIA/Reagan neuropathological criteria for intermediate-to-high likelihood AD or had both moderate-tofrequent neuritic plaque scores (i.e., CERAD score 2-3) and spatially extensive neurofibrillary tangle
burden (i.e., Braak stage III-VI).26-28 The controls did not meet clinical criteria for dementia or mild
cognitive impairment (MCI) and, when available, had a CDR of zero, within two years before they died;
they met neuropathological criteria for low-likelihood AD, had sparse neuritic plaques (CERAD score 1)
and spatially limited tangle burden (Braak Stages 0-II), or had no neuritic plaques (CERAD score 0) and
no more than moderately extensive tangle burden (Braak stages 0-IV).
For comparative purposes, we subsequently analyzed APOE and other relevant data in clinically
diagnosed but neuropathologically unexamined participants assembled by the ADGC from non-Hispanic
whites. Their clinical, neuropathological, and demographic assessment procedures and characteristics
were detailed in a previous report.29 Ages at clinical onset (when available) and last clinical examination
are shown for each APOE genotype in Supplementary Tables 2 and 3.

Statistical Analysis
For the assessment of ORs associated with each APOE genotype, we coded the APOE genotype of
interest as 1, coded the reference genotype as 0 (APOE2/2, APOE3/3, or APOE4/4), and treated other
genotypes as missing. We used clinical diagnosis as a binary outcome for the neuropathologically
confirmed, clinical, and combined group. Alzheimer’s dementia Odds Ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence
intervals (95% CIs) for each APOE genotype were computed compared to a reference APOE genotype.
We conducted genotypic association tests for each APOE genotype compared to a reference genotype or
allelic association tests for the APOE2 or the APOE4 allele using the binary outcome with and without
covariate adjustment for age and sex. For neuropathologically confirmed and misclassified autopsy
groups, we computed ORs under a logistic regression using a generalized linear model (GLM). For
clinical and combined groups, we further accounted for family structure due to containing families from
the Multi-Institutional Research on Alzheimer’s Genetic Epidemiology (MIRAGE) and National Institute on
Aging Late-onset AD (NIA-LOAD) study30 under a logistic regression using generalized estimating
equations (GEE). For the assessment of APOE2 allelic dose, we coded APOE3/3, APOE2/3, and
APOE2/2 as 0, 1, 2, respectively in the APOE4 non-carriers; and for the assessment of APOE4 allelic
dose, we coded APOE3/3, APOE3/4, and APOE4/4 as 0, 1, 2, respectively, in the APOE2 non-carriers.

We conducted allelic association tests for the APOE2 and APOE4 under a logistic regression using a
GLM for AD, LBD, VBI, HS and CAA. We used a sensitivity analysis, receiver operating characteristics
(ROC) curves, and areas under the curve (AUCs) to characterize and compare the contribution of APOE2
and APOE4 allelic doses on the classification of cases and controls in the neuropathologically confirmed
and unconfirmed groups. To rank predictors based on their contributions to the logistic regression model,
we calculated variance importance scores using the varImp option in R, which the importance score is
ranged from 0 to 100%.
Data from the neuropathological cohort were used to generate the Kaplan-Meier curves for each
APOE genotype that are shown in Figure 1. The curves indicate the percentage of neuropathologically
confirmed cases and controls who remained free from Alzheimer’s dementia as a function of age. When
estimated ages at dementia onset were not available, ages at death were used as a proxy.
CERAD scores and Braak stages were quantified for each APOE genotype in the aggregate group of
autopsied cases and controls from both neuropathologically confirmed and misclassified autopsy groups.
Linear regression using the GLM model was used to assess the effect of each APOE genotype
comparing to the reference genotype for CERAD and Braak measurements as quantitative outcomes,
repeated using CERAD scores as a covariate to assess residual effects of Braak stage.

Genotype

Allelic Dose

The ADGC’s “neuropathologically confirmed group” includes cases who met clinical and
neuropathological criteria for Alzheimer’s dementia and controls in the who were cognitively unimpaired at
their last clinical exam and did not meet neuropathological criteria for AD at autopsy.
The ADGC’s neuropathologically unconfirmed group includes cases who met clinical criteria for
Alzheimer’s dementia and cognitively unimpaired controls, who were included irrespective of any
antemortem biomarker or subsequent post-mortem neuropathological assessments they may have had.
OR refers to odds ratio. 95% CI refers to 95% confidence interval
ORs for each APOE genotype were calculated using genotypic association tests compared to the
APOE3/3 genotype as the reference in an additive genetic model.
ORs associated with APOE2 allelic dose in APOE4 non-carriers (APOE2/2<2/3<3/3) and APOE4 allelic
dose in APOE2 non-carriers (APOE4/4>3/4>3/3) were generated using allelic association tests in an
additive genetic model.
The number and percentage of cases and controls, ages at estimated clinical onset or last clinical exam,
and ages at death are shown for each APOE genotype, are shown for each group in Supplementary
Tables 1 and 2.

* Beta estimates in a linear regression model, relative to APOE2/3, 3/3, and 4/4. Beta coefficients reflect
the impact of each genotype on Braak stage after adjustment for CERAD score. Positive and negative
beta coefficients correspond to increased or decreased Braak stage, respectively. Findings do not
account for potentially confounding effects of age at death, clinical duration prior to death, or sex.
