Abstract
Background: Treatment responsiveness of dermatophytosis has decreased considerably in
recent past in India. We compared effectiveness of oral terbinafine daily (Terb) (active
control) versus itraconazole daily (Itra) versus terbinafine plus itraconazole daily (TI) versus
terbinafine daily plus itraconazole pulse (TIp) in tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei in
a pragmatic randomized open trial.
Methods: Ninety-two microscopically confirmed patients were allocated to Terb (6
mg/kg/day), Itra (5 mg/kg/day), TI (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day, itraconazole 5 mg/kg/day), or
TIp (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day, itraconazole 10 mg/kg/day for 1 week in 4 weeks) group by
concealed block randomization and treated for 8 weeks or cure.
Results: Cure rates were similar at 4 weeks (P=0.768). At 8 weeks, 5 (21.7%), 18 (78.3%),
16 (69.6%), and 16 (69.6%) patients were cured in Terb, Itra, TI, and TIp groups,
respectively. All experimental regimens (Itra, TI, TIp) were more effective than Terb
(P≤0.0027). All experimental regimens had similar effectiveness (P≥0.738). Relapse rates 4
and 8 weeks after cure were similar (P=0.869 and 0.314, respectively). Number-needed-totreat (NNT) was 2 for Itra, 3 for TI, and 3 for TIp.
Conclusions: Oral itraconazole given daily (NNT=2) is the most effective treatment and
combining it with terbinafine does not increase effectiveness.

Introduction
Unprecedented changes in the epidemiology, clinical features and treatment responsiveness
of dermatophytosis have been noted in recent past in India.1-4 Many patients present with
extensive dermatophytosis (Figure 1a). Recent data show that terbinafine, once a highly
effective drug, now has an abysmal cure rate of 30.6% in tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea
faciei when given orally at a dose of 5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks.5 Decreased effectiveness of
terbinafine has been attributed to mutation in the squalene epoxidase gene.6, 7 Furthermore,
there is general impression and unpublished data with us of decreased effectiveness of other
antifungal drugs also in India. Importance of finding effective methods of treating tinea
cannot be overemphasized.
In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that using a regimen consisting of more than
one oral antifungal drugs may produce better treatment outcome. We performed a four-arm
pragmatic randomized open trial comparing effectiveness of oral terbinafine (Terb, active
control) versus 3 experimental regimens, itraconazole daily (Itra) versus terbinafine plus
itraconazole daily (TI) versus terbinafine daily plus itraconazole pulse (TIp).
Materials and Methods
Setting
The study (registered with Clinical Trials Registry-India, registration number
CTRI/2018/09/015843) was conducted at a tertiary care centre after obtaining approval from
the Institutional Ethics Committee.

Sample size
A sample size of 23 patients in each group was determined using expected cure rates of
33.3% and 80% with the control and experimental regimens, respectively, with type I error
rate of 0.05, type II error rate of 0.1 and dropout rate of 20%.8
Selection criteria and enrolment
Patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris or tinea faciei or a combination of these conditions
were included in the trial. Inclusion criteria were (a) clinical suspicion of tinea corporis, tinea
cruris or tinea faciei, (b) microscopic confirmation (potassium hydroxide [KOH] microscopy)
(Figure 1b), and (c) age 4 to 80 years. Exclusion criteria were (a) presence of any other
type(s) of tinea, e.g., onychomycosis, (b) pregnancy, (c) lactation, (d) inability to come for
follow-up, (e) history of adverse reaction to terbinafine or itraconazole, (f) abnormal
complete blood count (CBC), liver and renal function tests (LFT, RFT), (g) current treatment
with drugs likely to cause interaction with terbinafine or itraconazole, (h) present history of
renal, liver or ischemic heart disease, (i) presence of another skin disease at the site of tinea,
(j) treatment with terbinafine or itraconazole in last one month, and (k) patients requiring
antihistamines due to other skin disease. A witnessed, written and informed consent was
given by the patients, or by a parent in case of minor patients. All female patients of child
bearing age were advised to avoid pregnancy during treatment.
One thousand three hundred twenty six patients with suspected tinea corporis, tinea cruris or
tinea faciei or a combination of these conditions attending dermatology outpatient department
were assessed for eligibility. A total of 92 patients satisfied the selection criteria and were
assigned to one of the four treatment groups by block randomization on the basis of random
numbers generated online using Research Randomizer (https://www.randomizer.org/)
(allocation ratio 1:1:1:1). Each treatment group comprised 23 patients (Figure 2). Patients

were enrolled from October 2018 to December 2018. Allocation was concealed using
sequentially numbered, sealed, opaque envelopes, which contained the allocation code
written on a folded paper, the envelopes were opened after enrolment of the patients. Both
random sequence generation and allocation concealment were done by a person unrelated to
the trial.
Treatment
Doses given to the patients were as follows: Terb (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day), Itra (itraconazole
5 mg/kg/day), TI (terbinafine 6 mg/kg/day, itraconazole 5 mg/kg/day), and TIp (terbinafine 6
mg/kg/day, itraconazole 10 mg/kg/day [with a maximum of 400 mg per day] for 1 week in 4
weeks). Patients received the treatment for 8 weeks or cure, whichever occurred earlier.
Patients were advised against using any other treatment.
Follow-up
Following data were recorded for each patient: body surface area (BSA) affected, treatment
given, investigations CBC, LFT, and RFT at baseline, microscopy results, and follow-up
data. In the terbinafine group, CBC and LFT were done every 2 weeks. In the patients who
received itraconazole, following investigations were done every 2 weeks: CBC, LFT; and
following every 4 weeks: RFT, fasting lipid profile, electrocardiogram, and urine routine and
microscopy.
The most severe lesion was identified as the index lesion, from which scraping and KOH
microscopy was performed at baseline and then at every subsequent visit. Patients were
followed up at 2 weekly intervals up to a maximum of 8 weeks or cure, whichever occurred
earlier.

Measurement of treatment effect
Cure was defined as occurrence of both clinical cure (complete clearance of lesions) and
mycological cure (negative KOH microscopy). Presence of post-inflammatory
hyperpigmentation at the site of healed tinea was not considered a feature of tinea. Any of the
following was considered treatment failure: (a) no improvement or worsening of the disease
in 4 weeks in patient’s assessment, (b) presence of scaling and/or erythema at 8 weeks, and
(c) positive microscopy at 8 weeks. Patients who were cured were asked whether they were
fully satisfied with the treatment outcome or not. Patients in whom the treatment failed were
treated outside the clinical trial as follows: terbinafine failures with itraconazole, itraconazole
failures with terbinafine, and failures in the combination regimens with fluconazole.
Measurement of compliance
Patients were asked to bring used strips of tablets and the strips in use at each follow up visit
to assess compliance. Compliance was considered to be good if a patient had taken 80% or
more of the prescribed number of tablets, and poor if less than 80% tablets were taken during
treatment.
Assessment for relapse
Those patients who were cured were assessed again 4 and 8 weeks after the cure to look for
relapse of tinea (presence of erythema and scaling at the site of healed tinea).
Outcome measures
Number of patients cured at 8 weeks with the different regimens was the primary outcome
measure. Secondary outcome measures included number of patients cured at 4 weeks, relapse

rate, and frequency of adverse events. In addition, severity of itching was noted on a 0 (no
itching) to 10 (most severe itching) at baseline and subsequent follow-ups.
Statistical analysis
For the baseline variables, mean and standard deviation (SD) or median and interquartile
range (IQR, IQ1- IQ3) were calculated depending on the distribution of data. Cure rates,
relapse rates and compliance were compared by Fisher exact test. P values less than 0.05
were considered significant. All P vales are two-tailed. Absolute risk reduction (ARR) of
treatment failure versus the control (terbinafine daily) and number needed to treat (NNT)
were calculated. When appropriate, 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Intention
to treat analysis was performed for the effectiveness data. Compliance data were analysed on
per protocol basis. Denominator for calculating compliance was the total number of patients
who were cured and those who came for follow ups up to 8 weeks but were not cured.
Denominator for calculation of relapse rate was the number of patients who had achieved
cure. For calculating relapse rate, those cured patients who could not be followed up were
considered relapsed.
Results
Baseline characterises of the patients
Patients in the 4 groups were comparable at baseline with regard to age, duration of tinea, and
body surface area affected (Table 1). Sixty patients had tinea corporis et cruris, 14 tinea
corporis et cruris et faciei, 9 tinea corporis, 6 tinea cruris, 2 tinea fasciei, and 1 had tinea
corporis et faciei. Four patients had received oral antifungal treatment in past (none received
terbinafine or itraconazole in past 1 month). Seventeen, 19, 18, and 20 patients in the Terb,
Itra, TI, and TIp groups, respectively, had applied some topical preparations in the past.

Cure rates at 4 weeks
At 4 weeks, 2 (8.7%), 4 (17.4%), 5 (21.7%), and 3 (13.0%) patients were cured in Terb, Itra,
TI, and TIp groups, respectively. The cure rates were not significantly different (P=0.768)
(Figure 2).
Cure rates at 8 weeks
At 8 weeks, 5 (21.7%), 18 (78.3%), 16 (69.6%), and 16 (69.6%) patients were cured in Terb,
Itra, TI, and TIp groups, respectively. Comparison of different pairs of treatment groups
showed that all experimental regimens (Itra, TI, TIp) were more effective than Terb
(P≤0.0027). Cure rates with the three experimental regimens were not significantly different
(P≥0.738) (Figure 2, Table 3).
Severity of itching
Severity of itching decreased in all treatment groups as the treatment progressed and itching
was absent in all patients at the time of cure (Table 4).
Relapse rate at 4 and 8 weeks
Two out of 5 cured patients (40.0%), 4 of 18 (22.2%), 5 of 16 (31.3%), and 4 of 16 (25.0%)
patients relapsed within 4 weeks of cure in Terb, Itra, TI, and TIp groups, respectively.
Relapse rates were not significantly different (P=0.869) (Figure 2, Table 2).
By 8 weeks, 2 (40.0%), 10 (55.6%), 8 (50.0%), and 4 (25.0%) patients had relapsed in Terb,
Itra, TI, and TIp groups, respectively. Relapse rates at 8 weeks were not significantly
different (P=0.314) (Figure 2, Table 2).

Compliance
Twenty out of 20 patients, 20 of 22, 19 of 21, and 18 of 19 patients had good compliance in
Terb, Itra, TI, and TIp groups, respectively. The difference was not significant (P= 0.714).
Patients’ satisfaction with treatment outcome
All patients, who were cured, were fully satisfied with the outcome.
Number needed to treat
Number needed to treat (NNT) for the experimental groups were as follows: 2 for Itra, 3 for
TI, and 3 for TIp (Table 5).
Adverse events
In the Itra group, one patient at 4 weeks had raised serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase
enzyme (SGPT) and serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase levels (SGOT) (both >100 u/l),
and one patient at 6 weeks had raised SGOT (>100 u/l). One patient in TI group had raised
SGPT and SGOT (both >100 u/l) at 4 weeks. Treatment was stopped in these 3 patients. Test
results became normal in subsequent investigations performed after 2 weeks. No other
adverse events were detected on investigations and none were reported by the patients.
Discussion
Present study was conducted in view of unprecedented changes in the epidemiology, clinical
features and treatment responsiveness of tinea infections in recent past in India.1-4 Recent data
show that terbinafine, once a highly effective drug, now has abysmal cure rate in tinea
corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei.5 These results confirmed the general impression among
Indian dermatologists that terbinafine is fast losing its effectiveness. There is also a general

impression, and we have unpublished data, that effectiveness of other antifungal drugs has
also declined.
Terbinafine has been considered to be the oral antifungal drug of choice for dermatophytosis
due to its high cure rates, fungicidal action, minimal drug interactions and a general lack of
serious adverse effects. However, evidence shows that this is no longer the case in the current
epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India, which is characterized by altered morphology,
extensiveness, abysmal responsiveness to terbinafine,5 and chronicity and frequent relapses
within weeks of apparent cure.9 It is obviously important that new treatment methods are
tested for their effectiveness in tinea infections in the current situation.
We tested the hypothesis that using a multidrug therapy regimen may produce better
treatment outcome in tinea. Terbinafine and itraconazole were selected as the two antifungal
agents for multidrug therapy because they have different mechanisms of action. Effectiveness
of oral terbinafine daily (Terb) (active control) was compared with itraconazole daily (Itra),
terbinafine plus itraconazole daily (TI), and terbinafine daily plus itraconazole pulse (TIp) in
tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei within a pragmatic randomized open design.
Cure rates at 4 weeks with the four treatments were not significantly different. Comparison of
cure rates at 8 weeks with different pairs of treatment groups showed that all experimental
regimens (Itra, TI, TIp) were more effective than Terb. Although cure rates with all
experimental regimens were not significantly different at 8 weeks, number needed to treat
(NNT) showed that itraconazole given alone was the most effective treatment.
NNT for the experimental group Itra (itrconazole alone) was 2, and that for TI and TIp each,
it was 3; meaning thereby that, compared to Terb, 3 patients need to be treated with TI or TIp
to achieve one additional cure, while only 2 patients need to be treated with Itra for the same

effect. Thus, itraconazole was the most effective treatment out of the four treatments tested in
the study.
Compliance and relapse rates were similar in the four groups. Of the 92 patients, only 3, who
received itraconazole daily (one of them received terbinafine in addition), had reversible
raised liver enzyme levels in the present study. However, the importance of closely
monitoring liver enzymes cannot be overemphasized when treating patients with itraconazole
or terbinafine.
A limitation of the present study is that it was not blinded.
Data presented suggest that effectiveness of oral terbinafine in tinea has declined further
compared to the very recent data (30.6%5 versus 8.7% cure rate at 4 weeks in the present
study). However, this can not be definitively commented upon because the present study was
not designed to find out effectiveness of a single agent, which would require a larger sample
size.
Data presented herein show that treatment with itraconazole alone given daily is the most
effective treatment for patients with tinea corporis, tinea cruris and tinea faciei in the current
epidemic of altered dermatophytosis in India, and that the addition of terbinafine to
itraconazole regimen does not increase its effectiveness.
