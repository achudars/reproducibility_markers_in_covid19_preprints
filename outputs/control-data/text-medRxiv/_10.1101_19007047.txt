ABSTRACT
Objective To evaluate whether characteristics of pivotal efficacy trials supporting US Food and
Drug Administration (FDA) approval of novel therapeutic agents have changed over the past
three decades.
Design Cross-sectional study.
Setting and population Publicly available data on novel therapeutics approved by the FDA
between 1995-1997, 2005-2007, and 2015-2017.
Main outcome measures Use of randomization, blinding, types of comparators and primary
endpoints, number of treated patients, and trial duration in pivotal trials supporting novel
therapeutic approval, both individually and aggregated by each indication approval. Analyses
were repeated stratifying by use of orphan designation and use of special regulatory programs.
Results There were 273 novel therapeutics approved by the FDA in these 3 periods (107 in
1995-1997, 57 in 2005-2007, 109 in 2015-2017), representing 339 indications (157, 64, and 118,
respectively). Overall, the proportion of indication approvals supported by at least 2 pivotal trials
decreased (80.6% in 1995-1997, 60.3% in 2005-2007, 52.8% in 2015-2017; p<0.001). The
proportion supported by only single-arm pivotal trials increased (4.0% in 1995-1997, 12.7% in
2005-2007, 17.0% in 2015-2017; p=0.001), as did the proportion supported by at least one
pivotal trial of 6 months’ duration (25.8% in 1995-1997, 34.9% in 2005-2007, 46.2% in 20152017; p=0.001). When stratified by use of special regulatory programs, pivotal trial
characteristics changed over time in divergent ways, both individually and when aggregated by
indication approvals.
Conclusion More recent FDA approvals of novel therapeutics were based on fewer pivotal trials,
with less rigorous designs but longer trial durations. These findings reinforce the importance of

What is already known on this topic:
-

Pivotal trial characteristics supporting US Food and Drug Administration approval of
novel therapeutic agents vary widely across therapeutic characteristics.

-

A growing number of approvals make use of special regulatory programs that expedite
the development and review of potentially transformative drugs, such as Fast Track,
Priority Review, Accelerated Approval, and Breakthrough Designation.

-

Special regulatory programs often offer more flexible requirements for approval, such as
requiring only a single pivotal trial or trials using surrogate endpoints.

What this study adds:
-

Over the past three decades, the characteristics of the aggregate pivotal trials supporting
new drug approvals has changed, with more recent approvals requiring fewer trials of less
rigorous design.

-

Differences in pivotal trial characteristics over time persist after accounting for the
increasing use of special regulatory programs.

-

Divergent patterns are observed among approvals making use of special regulatory
programs, for which more recent approvals have required fewer trials of less rigorous
design, as compared to approvals using the standard pathway, for which more recent
approvals have required trials of more rigorous design.

INTRODUCTION
In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issues approvals for new
drugs and biologics that have demonstrated safety and efficacy in “adequate and well-controlled
studies”[1]. Pivotal trials are the most critical of these trials, often identified directly by FDA
reviewers as the basis for approval and described in detail in FDA approval packages [1]. Early
guidance suggested that at least two such trials were required for approval [2], but the FDA has
maintained a flexible interpretation, taking into consideration the ethical acceptability of
conducting additional trials or the rarity of diseases when determining the sufficient threshold for
safety and efficacy [3]. As a result, the quantity and quality of evidence supporting recent drug
approvals is variable, both in terms of the number of pivotal trials and their design features, such
as randomization, blinding, choice of comparators and endpoints, number of treated patients, and
trial duration [4–6].
Potentially contributing to this variability is the increasing number of special regulatory
programs available to the FDA over the past 30 years, now including Fast Track (1988, in statute
1997), Priority Review (1992), Accelerated Approval (1992), and Breakthrough Designation
(2012). Many of these programs codify special evidentiary standards acceptable for FDA
approval of certain drugs and biologics, with the goal of promoting earlier market availability of
certain therapies, such as those addressing an unmet need, or those treating serious or lifethreatening conditions (Box S1). As these new programs are conformed to the regulatory
environment in addition to existing programs such as Orphan Designation (1983) for rare
diseases [7], it is critical to understand their potential influence on the quality of evidence
supporting the new drugs and biologics that clinicians prescribe to their patients.

To address this question, we examined the clinical evidence supporting FDA approval of
new drugs and biologics in the following three-year periods, selected to illustrate the step-wise
statutory implementation of the special regulatory programs across three decades: 1995-1997,
2005-2007, and 2015-2017. We characterized all new drug and biologic approvals within each
given year, as well as the pivotal trials supporting these approvals, and determined whether trial
design features differed by time period, including use of randomization, blinding, types of
comparators, types of primary endpoints, number of treated patients, and trial duration. These
findings will offer important insights into the influence of special regulatory programs on FDA’s
evidentiary standards for new drugs and biologics over time, as well as helping patients and
clinicians better understand whether the clinical evidence supporting FDA approvals has
changed.

METHODS
Sample Construction
The FDA lists all new drug applications and biological licensing applications on the
Drugs@FDA database [8]. Using a previously-described method [5], we identified new drugs
and biologics (e.g. new molecular entities (NMEs) or new biologic drugs) approved between the
years of 1995-1997, 2005-2007, and 2015-2017, excluding new formulations, generics, and nontherapeutic agents (e.g. diagnostic and contrast agents). We obtained the complete action
package for the original approval of each therapeutic, either through the Drugs@FDA database,
or in the case of the 1995-1997 therapeutics, through a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
request.

Therapeutic Characteristics
Based on information from the approval package, we classified each novel therapeutic by
period of approval and product type (small-molecule or biologic). Using information available in
the approval packages and from public listings available on the FDA website, we identified
whether each therapeutic was evaluated through a special regulatory program (Priority Review,
Accelerated Approval, Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy) [9–12]. These special regulatory
programs are used for therapeutics that are intended to address “unmet medical needs” for
serious or life-threatening conditions [13]. Data on certain special regulatory programs was not
available in all years; data for Fast Track was only available after 1997, when it was codified by
the 1997 Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA), and Breakthrough
Therapy was only introduced in 2012 by the Food and Drug Administration Safety and
Innovation Act (FDASIA) [14].
Using information available in the approval packages, we identified the indications for
each novel therapeutic at the time of initial approval. We classified these into one of eight
therapeutic areas based on the World Health Organization’s Anatomic Therapeutic Classification
System [15]. Using the Orphan Products Designation Database, we also determined whether
these originally-approved indications had been granted orphan status, a designation granted at
sponsor request to drugs for indications for which there are 200,000 or fewer patients in the
United States, indications for which alternative therapeutic options are often not available [16].

Trial Characteristics
We followed a previously-described method to identify and characterize the pivotal
efficacy trials used as the basis of approval for each indication of each new drug or biologic

[4,5]. Briefly, these were generally labeled as “pivotal” by FDA medical reviewers; in cases
where they were not explicitly labeled, we identified these trials using FDA medical reviewer
descriptions of clinical studies, including those trials described as essential to approval or those
highlighted individually for discussion of study design or analysis of study results. Additionally,
any new efficacy trial reviewed as part of a resubmitted application was considered pivotal to
approval.
For each identified trial, we determined its use of randomization and blinding,
categorized as randomized vs. non-randomized and double-blinded vs. not double-blinded,
respectively. Next, we categorized use of a comparator as active treatment, placebo control, or
none, in the case of single-arm trials. We categorized primary trial endpoints as clinical
endpoints, clinical scales, or surrogate endpoints using a previously developed framework [5,17].
Briefly, clinical endpoints, such as death or hospitalization, are those that measure patientreported outcomes, function, or survival; clinical scales, such as the visual analog scale for pain,
represent ordinal characterization of symptoms; and surrogate endpoints, such as hemoglobin
A1c, represent biomarkers expected to predict clinical benefit. We determined the number of
treated patients by abstracting the number of patients included in intention-to-treat (ITT)
analyses. We also determined the duration of each trial. For time-driven endpoints, duration was
defined as the time of primary endpoint measurement, such as hemoglobin A1c at 24 weeks. For
event-driven endpoints, such as progression-free survival, duration was defined as the median
follow-up time for participants, or a weighted average of the median follow-up time in cases
where it differed between trial arms. Initial abstraction was performed by 3 investigators (ADZ,
JP, NSD).

Statistical Analysis
We used descriptive statistics to characterize the sample of new drugs and biologics and
their indications for use, and to characterize the features of their supporting pivotal trials. We
used chi-squared tests for trend and Spearman rank tests as appropriate to compare trial
characteristics across the three periods of interest, first at the level of individual pivotal trials and
then considering the aggregate pivotal trial evidence supporting each indication approval.
Analyses aggregated by indication included only those indications for which pivotal trial
characteristic reporting was complete, to prevent undercounting in cases with missing data. We
stratified analyses by use of any special regulatory program, as defined above, and by use of
orphan designation.
As supplementary analyses, we repeated analyses stratified by product type (smallmolecule vs. biologic) and therapeutic area. We conducted sensitivity analyses considering the
effect of expected length of treatment on duration. Expected length of treatment was determined
categorized as acute for those whose expected length of use was less than 1 month, intermediate
for those between 1 month and 2 years, and chronic for those greater than 2 years. We also
conducted sensitivity analyses examining the individual regulatory programs spanning three time
periods (e.g. Priority Review and Accelerated Approval). All statistical tests were 2-tailed and
used the Bonferroni method to adjust p-values to account for multiple comparisons. All analyses
were conducted using R version 3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

Patient Involvement
No patients were involved in setting the research question or the outcome measures, nor
were they involved in developing the design or implementation of the study. Our findings will be

made available to patients, but there are no plans to partner with patients for dissemination.
Because this study did not use patient data, it was exempt from review by the Yale Human
Investigation Committee.

RESULTS
Study Sample
We identified 273 new drugs and biologics approved by the FDA for 339 indications
across three periods: 107 drugs for 157 indications in 1995-1997, 57 drugs for 64 indications in
2005-2007, and 109 drugs for 118 indications in 2015-2017. Product and indication
characteristics differed across these periods (Table 1). The proportion of biologics represented
among new approvals has increased, as have the proportion of approvals using any special
regulatory program (34.6% in 1995-1997, 57.9% in 2005-2007, 64.2% in 2015-2017) or orphan
designation (12.7% in 1995-1997, 26.6% in 2005-2007, 38.1% in 2015-2017; all p<0.001). The
therapeutic areas associated with new indication approvals have shifted, with the most common
therapeutic area being infectious disease in 1995-1997 (n=53, 33.8%), oncology in 2015-2017
(n=32, 27.1%) (Table 1).

Features of Individual Pivotal Trials
We identified a total of 802 pivotal trials supporting the new drugs and biologics in our
sample: 408 trials in 1995-1997, 141 trials in 2005-2007, and 253 trials in 2015-2017. Of these
pivotal trials, the majority were randomized (Table 2), though randomization decreased from
93.6% in 1995-1997 to 82.2% in 2005-2007 and 2015-2017 (p<0.001). Likewise, most trials
were double-blinded, though double-blinding decreased from 79.4% in 1995-1997 to 67.4% in

2005-2007 and 67.6% in 2015-2017 (p<0.001). Choice of comparators differed by time period,
as use of active comparators decreased (44.1% in 1995-1997, 34.0% in 2005-2007, and 29.2% in
2015-2017; p<0.001) while single-arm trials increased (8.5% in 1995-1997, 17.7% in 20052007, and 17.8% in 2015-2017; p<0.001). Sensitivity analyses were conducted examining rates
of randomization and blinding only among trials using comparators and showed no changes over
time (Table S2).
Choice of primary endpoints also differed over time, as use of clinical endpoints
decreased (43.8% in 1995-1997, 28.4% in 2005-2007, and 23.3% in 2015-2017; p<0.001) while
use of surrogate endpoints increased (48.3% in 1995-1997, 60.3% in 2005-2007, and 59.3% in
2015-2017; p=0.004). Median number of treated patients in each pivotal trial also increased (277
[IQR 150-442] in 1995-1997, 404 [IQR 189-622] in 2005-2007, and 467 [IQR 209-722] in 20152017; p<0.001), as did median trial duration (11.0 weeks [IQR 4.9-24.0] in 1995-1997, 16.0
weeks [IQR 6.0-26.0] in 2005-2007, and 24.0 weeks [IQR 12.0-37.6] in 2015-2017; p<0.001).

Features of Aggregated Pivotal Trials Supporting Indication Approvals
Overall, 7 (2.0%) of 339 indication approvals were not supported by any pivotal trial
(Table S3). Of the 332 indication approvals supported by pivotal trials, 293 (88.3%) had
complete reporting of all abstracted pivotal trial characteristics within the FDA documentation
(82.7% in 1995-1997, 98.4% in 2005-2007, and 89.8% in 2015-2017; Tables S4-5). Among
these 293 indication approvals, the proportion supported by at least 2 pivotal trials decreased
over time (80.6% in 1995-1997, 60.3% in 2005-2007, and 52.8% in 2015-2017; p<0.001) (Table
4). The proportion of indication approvals supported only by single-arm trials increased over
time (4.0% in 1995-1997, 12.7% in 2005-2007, 17.0% in 2015-2017; p=0.001). The proportion

of indication approvals supported only by trials using surrogate endpoints was not statistically
different over time (p=0.36), nor was the median aggregated number of treated patients (p=0.89)
(Tables 4-5). The proportion of indication approvals with at least one trial of 6 months’ duration
increased (25.8% in 1995-1997, 34.9% in 2005-2007, 46.2% in 2015-2017; p=0.001).

Aggregated Pivotal Trial Features Supporting Indication Approvals by Use of Special
Regulatory Programs
The proportion of new drug or biologic approvals using any special regulatory program
(Priority Review, Accelerated Approval, Fast Track, or Breakthrough Designation) increased
over time, with 37 (34.6%) in 1995-1997, 33 (57.9%) in 2005-2007, and 70 (64.2%) in 20152017 (p<0.001). Among indication approvals using any special regulatory program, the
proportion supported by at least 2 pivotal trials decreased over time (75.0% in 1995-1997, 52.8%
in 2005-2007, 38.1% in 2015-2017; p<0.001) (Table 4). There were not statistically significant
changes in the proportion supported only by single-arm trials (p=0.11), only by trials using
surrogate endpoints (p=0.42), by at least one trial of 6 months’ duration (p=0.74), or in the
median aggregated number of treated patients (p=0.40) (Tables 4-5).
Among indication approvals not using any special regulatory program, there were not
statistically significant changes in the proportion supported by at least 2 pivotal trials (p=0.22),
only by single-arm trials (p=0.62), or by trials using surrogate endpoints (p=0.80) (Table 4).
However, the median aggregated number of treated patients increased over time (805 [IQR 5311403] in 1995-1997, 1167 [IQR 419-1835] in 2005-2007, 1740 [IQR 1047-2853] in 2015-2017;
p<0.001), as did the proportion supported by at least one trial of 6 months’ duration (17.4% in
1995-1997, 33.3% in 2005-2007, 39.5% in 2015-2017; p=0.004) (Tables 4-5).

Aggregated Pivotal Trial Features Supporting Indication Approvals by Orphan
Designation Status
The proportion of indication approvals receiving orphan designations increased over
time, with 20 (12.7%) in 1995-1997, 17 (26.6%) in 2005-2007, and 45 (38.1%) in 2015-2017
(p<0.001). Trends in the features of aggregated pivotal trials supporting indications over time
differed when stratified by orphan designation status. Among orphan indications, the proportion
of indication approvals supported by at least 2 pivotal trials decreased over time (72.7% 19951997, 23.5% in 2005-2007, 23.7% in 2015-2017; p=0.008) (Table 4). The proportion of orphan
indications supported only by single-arm trials did not change (p=0.49), while those supported
only by trials using surrogate endpoints (18.2% in 1995-1997, 52.9% in 2005-2007, 63.2% in
2015-2017; p=0.01) increased over time. The median aggregated number of treated patients for
orphan indications did not differ over time (p=0.42), nor did the proportion of indications with at
least one trial of 6 months’ duration (p=0.50) (Tables 4-5).
In contrast, the proportion of non-orphan indications supported by at least 2 pivotal trials
did not change over time (p=0.06), nor did those supported only by single-arm trials (p=0.14),
those supported only by trials using surrogate endpoints (p=0.50), or those supported by at least
one trial of 6 months’ duration (p=0.05). Meanwhile, the median aggregated number of treated
patients increased (811 [IQR 526-1369] in 1995-1997, 1027 [IQR 474-1584] in 2005-2007, 1646
[IQR 768-2668] in 2015-2017; p<0.001).

Supplementary analyses for individual pivotal trial and aggregated indication approval
characteristics were stratified by product type and therapeutic area, and expected length of
treatment (Tables S6-9). Sensitivity analyses were conducted examining trial duration stratified
by expected length of treatment (Tables S10-11). Trends in aggregated indication approval
characteristics over time were consistent when stratified by Priority Review and Accelerated
Approval considered separately (Tables S12-13) when compared to special regulatory programs
considered as a whole, as were trends when considering orphan designation as a special
regulatory program (Tables S14-15).

DISCUSSION
We reviewed all new drugs and biologics approved by the FDA in 1995-1997, 20052007, and 2015-2017 and found differences over time in the number and quality of the pivotal
trials supporting their approval. The aggregated evidence supporting indication approvals has
become less rigorous in some ways, with the proportion of approvals supported by the
commonly-understood standard of “at least 2 pivotal trials” declining from 81% to 53% and the
proportion of approvals supported by at least one trial using a comparator declining from 96% to
83%. Meanwhile, it has become more rigorous in other ways, with the proportion of indications
supported by at least one trial of 6 months’ duration increasing from 26% to 46%. These findings
have implications for patients and clinicians making decisions as to whether to use products
newly available on the market, as well as reinforcing the importance of FDA’s strategy for
requiring ongoing evaluation of therapeutic safety and efficacy after approval.

A key question is whether these overall trends are driven by changes in the frequency
with which approvals use special regulatory programs or orphan designation, or if there has been
an evolution in the standards needed to secure approval over time. Our findings suggest both
explanations may play a role. We found a significant increase in the proportion of new
indications approved using any special regulatory program or orphan designation, in line with
previous reports [7]. These changes are likely reflected in the overall trends regarding the
evidence supporting approvals, given that the use of special regulatory programs and orphan
designation are both associated with more flexible standards for approval [5,18]. Importantly,
however, we also found changes in the aggregated evidence over time even when accounting for
use of these programs, suggesting potential involvement of factors beyond compositional effects.
There was a decrease in the number of pivotal trials supporting an indication approval only
among therapeutics using a special regulatory program, while therapeutics not using a special
regulatory program showed increases in the aggregated number of treated patients and the
proportion of indications supported by a trial of at least 6 months’ duration. These trends were
consistent when examining individual associations with Priority Review, Accelerated Approval,
and Orphan Designation, which were used in all three time periods studied.
These divergent patterns in evidentiary requirements highlight the trade-offs inherent to
special regulatory programs and orphan status. These programs are intended to encourage
development in areas where there are clinically unmet needs, and accordingly facilitate approvals
based on fewer trials, shorter trials, or trials using surrogate markers of disease as endpoints, thus
requiring less time to ascertain an effect and enabling products to reach the market sooner. The
proliferation of the use of these programs over the past three decades, with their flexibility in
pre-market standards, reinforces the importance of a life-cycle approach to evaluating drug

efficacy and safety in today’s regulatory environment [19]. Proponents of this approach embrace
the use of post-marketing studies [20], pragmatic trials, and real-world evidence (RWE) to
ensure continued evidence development for new medical products. In part spurred by the 21st
Century Cures Act, the FDA has particularly embraced the use of RWE – defined expansively to
include clinical evidence obtained from a variety of settings, including electronic health records,
insurance claims, registries, and personal devices [21] – as a new frontier of regulatory science.
In the past few years, the FDA has furthered the integration of RWE into its medical product
evaluation process, issuing guidance on the use of RWE in decision-making about drugs,
biologics, and devices [22,23]. Continued development of life-cycle evaluation methods,
including enhanced requirements that ensure that studies are undertaken and reported, may
strengthen efforts to generate clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of drugs and biologics
after approval, to inform patients, clinicians, and regulators.

Limitations
Our study had several limitations. First, our study included only three-year samples of
approvals in each time period and cannot capture the full range of therapeutic agents and
variations in approval trends across entire decades. Second, given our sample, we could not fully
adjust for interactions between all combinations of drug attributes and special regulatory
programs and orphan status. For instance, it was not uncommon for a therapeutic approval to use
multiple special regulatory programs, and we could not fully account for the possibility that a
single regulatory program or attribute had disproportionate influence on the associations
observed. However, the consistency of our findings regarding special regulatory programs across
multiple individual special regulatory programs, as well as orphan designation, suggests that we

were able to capture major trends. Lastly, we included only clinical trials identified as pivotal
trials in our study. Other non-pivotal studies and data, such as observational studies or previous
marketing experience from other countries, may contribute to FDA reviewers’ holistic
evaluations of drugs under consideration in ways that cannot be captured by our approach.

CONCLUSION
The quality of clinical trial evidence used to support new drug and biologic approvals has
changed over the past three decades, requiring on average fewer pivotal trials with less robust
comparators, but with longer durations. This change has implications for physicians and patients
as they consider using newly-approved drugs, as well as for regulators, as it reinforces the
importance of FDA’s strategy for requiring ongoing evaluation of therapeutic safety and efficacy
after approval.
