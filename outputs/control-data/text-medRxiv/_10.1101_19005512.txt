Abstract

2

Background: Growing evidence suggests a role of occupation in the emergence and

3

manifestation of dementia. Occupations are often defined by complexity level, although

4

working environments and activities differ in several other important ways. We aimed to

5

capture the multi-faceted nature of occupation through its measurement as a categorical

6

(instead of quantitative) variable and explored its relationship with different types of

7

dementia.

8

Methods: We collected occupational history data of 2,121 dementia patients with various

9

suspected etiologies from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (age: 67±8, 57% male, MMSE:

10

21±5). Our final sample included individuals with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) dementia

11

(n=1,467), frontotemporal dementia (n=281), vascular dementia (n=98), Lewy Body diseae

12

(n=174) and progressive supranuclear palsy/corticobasal degeneration (n=101). Within the

13

AD group, we used neuropsychological data to further characterize patients by clinical

14

phenotypes. All participants were categorized into one of 11 occupational classes, across

15

which we evaluated the distribution of dementia (sub)types with Chi2 analyses. We gained

16

further insight into occupation-dementia relationships through post-hoc logistic regressions

17

that included various demographic and health characteristics as explanatory variables.

18

Results: There were significant differences in the distribution of dementia types across

19

occupation groups (Chi2=85.87, p<.001). Vascular dementia was relatively common in the

20

Transportation/Logistics sector, and higher vascular risk factors partly explained this

21

relationship. Alzheimer’s disease occurred less in Transportation/Logistics and more in

22

Health Care/Welfare occupations, which related to a higher/lower percentage of males. We

23

found no relationships between occupational classes and clinical phenotypes of AD

24

(Chi2=53.65, n.s.).

25

Conclusions: Relationships between occupation and dementia exist beyond complexity level,

26

which offers new opportunities for disease prevention and improvement of occupational

27

health policy.

Background

32

Dementia currently affects 46.8 million people worldwide [1], and this number is expected to

33

increase as the aging population grows. Causes of dementia include Alzheimer’s disease

34

(AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), vascular dementia (VaD) and movement disorders

35

such as Lewy Body disease (DLB), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and corticobasal

36

degeneration (CBD). Apart from age and genetic influences, lifestyle factors play a role in the

37

emergence and manifestation of dementia. For example, a comprehensive body of research

38

points to the influence of education and occupation on dementia incidence [2-5]. Occupation

39

could be an especially strong contributing factor, as most individuals spend a major part of

40

their life at work.

41
42

Studies on the relationship between occupation and dementia have generally focused on the

43

role of occupational complexity (e.g. rated as “white versus blue collar” [6]). Results indicate

44

that older individuals who engaged in greater levels of occupational complexity have a better

45

current cognitive status [6-13], a lower risk to develop dementia [5,14-17] or a different rate

46

of clinical progression after the onset of dementia [4,11,18]. However, these studies mostly

47

investigated one particular form of dementia, or “dementia” in general without specifying its

48

type. Moreover, the common quantification of occupation by complexity level represents an

49

oversimplification of the multi-faceted quality of this lifestyle factor. Working environments

50

and activities differ in several important ways beyond complexity level, such as the level of

51

physical activity, stress, social demands and exposure to hazardous substances [19,20].

52

Although a broader evaluation of occupation could thus provide important new insights in the

53

context of dementia, this approach is relatively rare.

54
55

To overcome this scarcity in the literature, we took a different approach by i) measuring

56

occupation in a categorical rather than a quantitative manner, without making prior

57

assumptions about complexity or other potential protective or harmful factors, and ii) studying

58

the relationships between occupation and various forms of dementia (i.e. different suspected

59

etiologies and clinical phenotypes). Our sample included >2000 memory clinic patients with

60

dementia due to AD, FTD, VaD or movement disorders. Occupation was categorized into

61

several nominal groups (e.g. Pedagogical, Agricultural, Transportation/Logistics), across

62

which we compared the distribution of these dementia types [21]. Within the AD subsample,

63

we had sufficient data to additionally investigate relationships between occupation and

64

specific cognitive profiles. As this study was exploratory in nature, we did not formulate a

65

priori hypotheses. For relationships that emerged, we gained further insight through post-hoc

66

analyses with additional demographic and health characteristics (i.e. age, sex, education and

67

vascular risk factors [VRFs]).

Methods

70

Participants

71

Participants were selected from the Amsterdam Dementia Cohort (ADC [22,23]). The sample

72

consists of individuals who visited the Alzheimer Center of the Amsterdam University Medical

73

Center between 2000 and 2017. They underwent a standardized screening process that

74

included the (patient and informant based) collection of demographic information, medical

75

history, neurological examination, neuropsychological assessment, standard laboratory tests,

76

brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and lumbar puncture in a subsample. Diagnosis

77

was established in a multidisciplinary meeting, based on common clinical and research

78

criteria [22]. Dementia diagnoses in the present study included AD, FTD, VaD, DLB and

79

PSP/CBD.

80
81

Assignment of occupational codes

82

Information on occupational history was collected by a physician during a semi-structured

83

interview with the participants and their informants. We subsequently coded this information

84

according to the Dutch ROA-CBS 2014 occupational categorization system (BRC 2014), a

85

derivative of the International Standard Classification of Occupations 2008 (ISCO 2008) [21].

86

The BRC 2014 consists of the following occupational classes: 1) Pedagogical, 2)

87

Creative/Linguistic, 3) Commercial, 4) Business/Administrative, 5) Management, 6)

88

Governmental/Law/Safety, 7) Technical, 8) Information and Communication Technology

89

(ICT), 9) Agricultural, 10) Health Care/Welfare, 11) Service, 12) Transportation/Logistics (see

90

Additional file 1). The BRC 2014 additionally includes a 13th “Other” category (mostly

91

applicable when occupational descriptions are absent or unclear), and makes further

92

divisions into segments and subgroups. For the present paper, we were only interested in the

93

occupational classes (i.e. classification at the segment level would result in 40 groups of

94

insufficient size). We excluded participants in the “Other” category and those classified as

95

“no occupation”. When multiple occupations were listed for a given participant, we used the

96

first job title for consistency reasons.

97
98

The assignment of BRC 2014 codes was performed by two raters (A.C.v.L and K.W.). To

99

promote interrater consistency, a subset of the sample was independently coded and

100

subsequently compared. Discordant cases were discussed with R.O. to reach consensus.

101

The remaining sample was divided among A.C.v.L. and K.W., and only ambiguous cases

102

were discussed and coded together. In rare occasions where this did not resolve

103

classification uncertainty, medical records were inspected for more details on occupational

104

history. If this did not provide useful information, the participant was coded as 13 (unclear),

105

hence excluded for further analysis.

106
107

Sample selection

108

We initially selected all ADC individuals with a dementia diagnosis at the baseline visit and

109

information on occupational history. Exclusion criteria were: 1) age below 40 years, 2)

110

presence of autosomal dominant mutations for a neurodegenerative disease. The original

111

selection consisted of 2,310 participants, of which we excluded 142 individuals with

112

occupational descriptions that were either non-informative, indicative of unemployment or not

113

detailed enough (even after inspection of medical records). Finally, we decided to omit the

114

category ICT due to the small sample size (n=12). ICT is a relatively “young” sector that did

115

not have a prominent position in the labor market during the period in which the majority of

116

our sample was employed. Similarly, 35 patients with relatively rare forms of dementia (e.g.

117

alcohol-related dementias, normal pressure hydrocephalus, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease) were

118

excluded (Figure 1). The final sample included 2,121 individuals, with a diagnosis of AD

119

(n=1,467), FTD (n=281), VaD (n=98), DLB (n=174) or PSP/CBD (n=101).

120
121

Vascular risk factors

122

Complete data on VRFs were available for the majority of our sample (n=1,562/2,121), and

123

included body mass index (BMI), smoking, alcohol use (units per day), and presence or

124

absence of a myocardial infarction, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and diabetes mellitus

125

in the medical history. We dichotomized BMI (≤25=0, >25=1), smoking (never smoked=0,

126

ever smoked=1) and alcohol (0-1 units per day=0, >1 units per day=1) in order to derive a

127

VRF score based on the sum of these seven risk factors [24].

128
129

Neuropsychological assessment

130

Nearly all individuals underwent an elaborate neuropsychological assessment within three

131

months of their diagnosis. For the AD dementia subsample, we therefore had a large dataset

132

available (n=1,071/1,467) that consisted of participants who were cognitively tested in each

133

of four cognitive domains: memory, attention/executive function, language and visuospatial

134

function [25]. The memory domain included the total immediate and delayed recall as well as

135

the recognition condition of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, and total recall in

136

condition A of the Visual Association Test. In the attention/executive function domain, we

137

used the Trail Making Test (part A and B), Stroop Test (condition I-III), 90-second Letter Digit

138

Substitution Test [26], Digits Forward and Backwards, Letter Fluency and total score on the

139

Frontal Assessment Battery. The language domain consisted of the Category Fluency, a

140

short version of the Boston Naming Test and the total number of correctly named items of

141

the Visual Association Test. Finally, the visuospatial function domain was assessed with the

142

Dot Counting, Number Location and Fragmented Letters subtests of the Visual Object and

143

Space Perception battery.

144
145

We carried out multiple imputation in SPSS 22.0 for Windows (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) to

146

account for missing data (ranging from 1-45% per test). This procedure was performed using

147

the fully conditional specification method, an iterative Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach

148

suitable for arbitrary patterns of missing data. We imputed 25 datasets and included

149

demographic, clinical, neuropsychological variables, APOE status and cerebrospinal fluid

150

biomarkers as predictors in the model (i.e. occupational code was not used). In the pooled

151

dataset, we created standardized residuals (i.e. W-scores) for each neuropsychological test

152

score based on regressions with age, sex and educational level (measured on a seven-item

153

scale, [27]). We calculated average W-scores across tests measuring memory,

154

attention/executive function, language and visuospatial function, to obtain cognitive domain

155

scores.

156
157

These cognitive domain scores were subsequently used to divide AD participants into clinical

158

phenotypes, according to a previously validated method [28]. Specifically, we averaged

159

across cognitive domains to create a “global cognition” composite score for each participant.

160

Next, each cognitive domain score was dichotomized based on whether they were below a

161

certain threshold relative to the global cognition score. A score of 1 thus means that a given

162

cognitive domain “stands out” by being more affected than (the combination of) other

163

domains. Based on these dichotomized scores, we assigned each participant to one of the

164

following cognitive profiles: 1) memory-dominant, 2) attention/executive-dominant, 3)

165

language-dominant, 4) visuospatial-dominant, 5) multi-domain (i.e. either more than one or

166

no cognitive domain=1). As this profile categorization relies on which threshold is used to

167

dichotomize the cognitive domain scores, we systematically tested all values between .250

168

and .500, and selected .225 as the “optimal” value that yielded 1) the lowest number of

participants in the multi-domain profile, 2) the lowest sum of squared group sizes

170

(Supplementary Figure 1). Most individuals had a memory-dominant cognitive profile

171

(n=292), followed by a language-dominant (n=140), attention/executive-dominant (n=130)

172

and visuospatial-dominant subgroup (n=126). The remaining participants fell into the multi-

173

domain category (n=383).

174
175

Statistical analyses

176

First, we carried out a Chi2 analysis in the total sample to investigate if the distribution of

177

dementia types differed across occupational classes. In a second analysis, we reran the

178

same model after exclusion of 93 persons with comorbid dementias (e.g. persons with AD as

179

the primary diagnosis, but who also met NINDS-AIREN criteria for VaD) to create a sample

180

with less overlap between diagnostic groups.

181
182

When Chi2 results were significant, we post-hoc inspected the adjusted residuals of each

183

combination of occupation and dementia type. Adjusted residuals reflect the difference

184

between the expected and observed count (e.g. the number of AD participants in the

185

Pedagogical occupational class). An absolute value of ~2 (i.e. 1.96 or -1.96) is considered

186

significant at the p<.05 level. Since our contingency table was relatively large, we used a

187

more stringent adjusted residual value threshold of ~3 (i.e. 3.29 or -3.29 corresponds to

188

p<.001; [29]). In addition, to assess whether the main relationships observed in significant

189

Chi2 analyses could be explained by other demographic and health variables, we additionally

190

performed logistic regressions. Specifically, we predicted dementia type from occupational

191

class and evaluated age, sex, education and VRF score as potential explanatory variables.

192

We used a forward selection procedure with a change-in-estimate (CIE) criterion of 10%

193

[30,31] and ran these models in all participants with complete data (n=1,562/2,121).

194
195

Finally, we carried out Chi2 analyses to investigate whether occupation related to cognitive

196

profiles within the AD subsample, following the same approach as described above. In a

second analysis, we reran the same model using a different threshold for the dichotomization

of cognitive domain scores (and subsequent categorization of participants into cognitive

findings.

Results

203

Participants

204

The mean age across diagnostic groups was 67±8 years (Table 1). Individuals with FTD

205

were younger compared to other groups (63±7), and DLB participants were significantly older

206

than the AD group (69±7). Overall, our sample included a somewhat larger proportion of

207

males (57%), presumably reflecting the historically higher prevalence of males in the labor

208

market (by comparison, the excluded “no occupation” sample was 82% female). The

209

proportion of males was even higher among DLB participants (82%) in comparison with most

210

other groups, while this was significantly lower for AD (52%) in contrast to all groups except

211

PSP/CBD. Educational level was similar across dementia types (except for a DLB>VaD

212

difference). Global cognitive impairment was most severe among AD participants (mean

213

MMSE=20±5). Finally, VaD participants had a higher VRF score than most other diagnostic

214

groups (p<.05; except FTD). Table 2 provides an overview of the number of participants in

215

each occupational class for the total sample and according to dementia type. The largest

216

occupation groups were Technical (n=429, 20%) and Business/Administrative (n=388, 18%),

217

while the Agricultural class had the lowest number of participants (n=31, 1%).

218
219

Relationship between occupation and dementia types

220

There were significant differences in the distribution of dementia types across occupation

221

groups (Chi2=85.87, p<.001, Table 2). The adjusted residuals revealed three effects

222

significant at p<.001. First, individuals from the Transportation/Logistics sector were more

223

often diagnosed with VaD (adjusted residual: 4.0). Second, this occupational class had fewer

224

AD participants (adjusted residual: -3.7). Third, in the Health Care/Welfare group, AD was

225

relatively common (adjusted residual: 3.6). These results are displayed in Figure 2, along

226

with 11 other effects (e.g. a high proportion of PSP/CBD cases in the Agricultural sector) that

227

were significant at p<.05 (adjusted residuals >2 or <-2). When we repeated the Chi2 analysis

228

with exclusion of 93 individuals with comorbid dementias (n=2,028), results remained

229

essentially unchanged (Chi2=78.73, p<.001; Supplementary Table 1).

230
231

Contribution of age, sex, education and vascular risk factors

232

In line with the previous results, uncorrected logistic regression models with either AD or VaD

233

as a dependent variable (AD/VaD=1 in separate models, other diagnosis=0) confirmed

234

Transportation/Logistics to be significantly related to both VaD (β=1.23, odds ratio [OR] =

235

3.41, p=.004) and AD (β=-.85, OR=.43, p=.001). Likewise, Health Care/Welfare was a

236

significant determinant of AD (β=.55, OR=1.74, p=.003; Supplementary Table 2). Forward

237

selection of explanatory variables in corrected models revealed that VRF score, but no other

238

factors (i.e. age, sex, education), was positively associated with a VaD diagnosis (β=.43,

239

OR=1.53, p<.001) and reduced the Transportation/Logistics effect by 15% (from β=1.23 to

240

1.04, OR=3.41 to 2.84). For AD, only the variable sex (range β=.68-.69, OR=1.96-1.98,

241

p<.001) significantly reduced the effects of Transportation/Logistics (from β=-.85 to -.62,

242

OR=.43 to .54; 27%) and Health Care/Welfare (from β=.55 to .31, OR=1.74 to 1.37; 43%).

243

Figure 3 gives an overview of the number of VRFs and percentage of males for all dementia

244

types and occupational classes.

245
246

Relationship between occupation and cognitive profiles of AD

247

We found only trend-significant differences between occupations in the distribution of

248

cognitive profiles (Chi2=53.65, p=.073; Table 3). Supplementary Figure 2 provides an

249

overview of these findings. In a secondary analysis, we repeated the same analysis using

250

cognitive profiles that were calculated based on a different threshold of -.442 (Supplementary

251

Figure 1). Similar to the original findings, these results were not significant (Chi2=38.24,

252

p=.550).

Discussion

255

In this exploratory study, we investigated the association between occupation and dementia

256

(sub)types in a large sample of memory-clinic patients. The main finding was that VaD was

257

relatively common in participants with Transportation/Logistics occupations. Post-hoc

258

analyses suggested that this relationship was partly explained by a higher number of VRFs

259

among these individuals. In addition, the number of AD participants was relatively low in the

260

Transportation/Logistics sector, and high among Health Care/Welfare occupations. We found

261

that these effects were mostly attributable to differences between groups in sex distribution.

262

There was no relationship between occupation types and AD-related cognitive profiles.

263
264

Our finding that VRFs are more prominent among VaD participants is in line with previous

265

studies [32,33], but of particular interest was our observation of a higher number of VRFs in

266

Transportation/Logistics occupations. Although we cannot make any inferences about

267

dementia risk (due to the absence of a healthy control group), it raises the possibility that

268

certain job-related aspects or occupational habits contribute to the development of VRFs and

269

the emergence of VaD. Our data at least warrant an increased awareness and monitoring of

270

VRFs by occupational physicians in the Transport/Logistics sector. Furthermore, the lower

271

presence of AD cases in Transpiration/Logistics groups (male-predominant) versus higher

272

AD occurrence Healthcare/Welfare (female-predominant), is in line with evidence that

273

women have a higher risk for AD than men [34,35]. Importantly, while VRFs and sex partially

274

explained our main occupation-dementia relationships, these factors did not account for all

275

variance. This suggests there might be other important ways in which occupations are

276

related to the emergence and manifestation of dementia.

277
278

In addition, it is worth mentioning that a relatively large proportion of the Agricultural sector

279

consisted of PSP/CBD cases (i.e. 13% versus 5% in the total sample). This effect was

280

significant at p<.05 (not at p<.001), but as the Agricultural group was rather small compared

to other occupational classes (n=31), this may be due to a lack of statistical power. Although

282

largely speculative, we propose that this effect could be related to exposure to pesticides

283

[36]. There has been increasing evidence that pesticides are a risk factor for Parkinson’s

284

disease [37], and one study has also demonstrated a specific link between pesticide

285

exposure and PSP [38].

286
287

In contrast to our present study, most previous studies operationalized occupation by

288

complexity level. Apart from coarse ratings such as “white versus blue collar”, more fine-

289

grained classifications have been made in which the complexity of multiple occupational

290

aspects was considered. An example is the use of questionnaires that differentiated between

291

working with “people, data or things” (e.g. [12]). However, although these approaches have

292

provided important insights, they did not consider other potential job-related risks or

293

protective factors. The few studies that did take a more qualitative approach towards the

294

measurement of occupation have used “job exposure matrices” or “occupational description

295

databases” to show, among other results, that dementia risk and late-life cognition were

296

influenced by the degree of work control (e.g. influence over work planning, variation in task

297

content) [39], level of human interaction and physical activity [40] and mental demands (e.g.

298

information processing, pattern detection, creativity) [41].

299
300

The novelty of the present work lies our “assumption-free” approach that did not involve any

301

additional

302

occupational classes. This enabled examining relationships between occupation and

303

dementia (sub)types in an exploratory manner. Importantly, there was no straightforward

304

relationship between occupational classes and complexity level. Most classes comprised

305

occupations that varied considerably with respect to complexity (e.g. the “Technical” group

306

both contained engineers and assembly workers, see Additional file 1). Another strength of

307

our study is the fact that our sample consisted of dementias with different suspected

308

etiologies. Most earlier studies have either focused on the occurrence of dementia as a

characterization of

occupations

besides their categorization across 11

309

general syndrome or one particular form of dementia. As our dataset included over two

310

thousand carefully diagnosed participants, we were able to create several independent

311

diagnostic groups and AD-related cognitive profiles that were sufficiently sized for statistical

312

analysis. Finally, we consider use of the BRC 2014 classification system to be an important

313

advantage, because it improves the replicability of our findings across other populations on

314

an international scale.

315
316

Our study has several limitations. First, although we collected occupational data with a

317

refined method that involved a semi-structured interview with the patient and caregiver, we

318

did not have detailed enough information to capture a person’s entire occupational timeline.

319

For individuals who had multiple occupations listed, we often could not retrieve their

320

sequence and respective durations. It is therefore possible that the first-mentioned job not

321

always reflect the person’s foremost/primary occupation, but rather the most recent

322

occupation. This is non-optimal because of potential reverse causation: we cannot rule out

323

that some patients switched jobs as a consequence of their dementia diagnosis (e.g.

324

choosing less demanding work in a different sector). However, we have no reason to assume

325

that reverse causation is more prominent for some dementia (sub)types than others, and

326

thus the degree of bias seems limited. Second, we were unable to define occupation groups

327

beyond the highest hierarchical level of the BRC 2014, due to a lack of detail in occupational

328

descriptions and the fact that the resulting number of categories would be too large for our

329

sample size (i.e. ~40 occupation groups). More detailed distinctions between occupations

330

may have revealed additional relevant occupation-dementia relationships that were currently

331

missed. Third, the absence of a healthy control group restricted our ability to make

332

inferences about dementia risk or distinguish between protective and harmful effects of

333

occupation (Supplementary Figure 3), which limits the interpretability of our results.

334
335

Conclusions

336

To conclude, we demonstrated relationships between occupation and dementia types. Our

337

findings suggest that these relationships emerged beyond occupational complexity level.

338

Differences between occupational classes in the number of VRFs and sex distributions

339

partially explained our results, but other - currently unknown - factors likely play a role as

340

well. It is important to note that associations between occupation and dementia could exist

341

for multiple reasons. Whilst it seems plausible that some occupational characteristics

342

causally relate to the occurrence of specific dementia types, another possibility is that certain

343

(genetic or early environmental) factors both influence career choice and dementia

344

development later in life. This is consistent with theoretical frameworks that propose a

345

neurodevelopmental component in the etiology of dementia [42-44]. Ultimately, as most

346

people spend the majority of their life working, occupation could be an important lifestyle

347

factor to consider in relation to preventive strategies for dementia. A better understanding of

348

occupation-dementia relationships may improve occupational health policy through reduction

349

of job hazards and more targeted health monitoring by occupational physicians.

Supplementary Figure 1. Thresholds used for the dichotomization of cognitive
domains and division of participants across cognitive profiles.
Within the AD subsample (n=1,071), we dichotomized each cognitive domain score (i.e.
memory, attention/executive functions, language and visuospatial functions), based on
whether or not a domain’s W-score was considerably lower compared to an individual’s
global cognition score. We used an optimal threshold between .250 and .500 for this
dichotomization, and defined “optimality” in two different ways: 1) the lowest number of
participants in the multi-domain profile and the lowest sum of squared group sizes
(threshold=.255), 2) the highest number of atypical variant AD cases (n=85) categorized into
the language (i.e. for logopenic aphasia) or visuospatial cognitive profile (i.e. for PCA;
n=.442). Note that neither thresholds (i.e. .255 or .442) resulted in all atypical variants being
categorized into these two cognitive profiles, presumably because in advanced disease
stages, several cognitive domains become affected. For many participants with an initial
logopenic aphasia or PCA diagnosis, visuospatial/language may no longer have been

Supplementary Figure 2. Proportions of AD-related cognitive profiles for each

There were no significant differences between groups (Chi2 n.s.).

Supplementary Figure 3. Schematic representation of protective and harmful effects
and resulting cells in the contingency table.
Each color (red, blue, green) represents a different occupational class. In scenario A, the red
occupational class is relatively protected against dementia type 1, while the distribution of the
remaining dementia types across occupations is equal. When the healthy control group is
included in the analysis, this protective effect will be reflected in a higher proportion of
individuals in red in the healthy group (4/6=67% versus 50% for blue/green) and a lower
percentage of red persons in the type 1 dementia group (0% versus 1/6=17% for blue/green).
All other proportions will be identical across occupational classes. However, when the
healthy control group is not taken into account, the protective effect of the red occupation for
dementia type 1 will create also an apparent “harmful” effect of the red occupation for
dementia types 2 and 3 (i.e. 1/2=50%, compared to 1/3=33% for blue/green). In scenario B,
the green occupational class shows a harmful effect on the development of dementia type 3,
while no other differences between groups exist. Again, when the healthy control group is
included, this only results in a lower percentage of healthy green individuals (1/6=17% versus
50% for red/blue) and a greater proportion of persons with green occupations in dementia
type 3 (i.e. 50% versus 1/6=17% for red/blue). In the absence of a healthy control group,
however, the green occupational class’ harmful effect for dementia type 3 leads to an
apparent “protective” effect for dementia types 1 and 2 (1/5=20%, compared to 1/3=33% for
red/blue).
