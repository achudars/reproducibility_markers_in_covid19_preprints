ABSTRACT: (max 250 words)

28

Background:

29

Early life adversity exposure impacts preterm infants’ neurodevelopment and early intervention

30

protocols may modulate neurodevelopmental outcomes.

31

Neuronal genomes are plastic in response to environment and mobile genetic elements, including LINE-

32

1 (L1), are source of brain genomic mosaicism. Maternal care during early life regulates L1 methylation

33

and copy number variations (CNVs) in mice. Here, we sought to identify the effects of maternal care

34

and positive multisensory stimulation (Early Intervention) on L1 methylation and neurodevelopment in

35

preterm infants.

36

Methods:

37

Very preterm infants were randomized to receive Standard Care or Early Intervention. L1 methylation

38

was measured at birth and at hospital discharge. At 12 months infants’ neurodevelopment was

39

evaluated with the Griffiths Scales. L1 methylation and CNVs were measured in mouse brain areas at

40

embryonic and postnatal stages.

41

Results:

42

We demonstrated that L1 is hypomethylated in preterm versus term infants at birth. Early Intervention

43

contributes to restore L1 methylation and positively modulates neurodevelopment. We showed that L1

44

methylation is developmentally-regulated in mice, decreasing in early postnatal life stages, which turns

45

into an increased L1 CNVs specifically in hippocampus and cortex.

46

Conclusions:

47

Here we demonstrated that L1 dynamics can be modulated by Early Intervention, in parallel with

48

ameliorated neurodevelopmental outcomes. We further identified a specific developmental window of

49

the fetal mouse brain, sensitive to early life experience, in which L1 dynamics are fine-tuned contributing

50

to shape the brain genomic landscape.

INTRODUCTION

57

Prematurity, which is defined as birth before 37 weeks of gestation, affects 11% of neonates globally,

58

it is the second leading cause of death in children below 5 years of age and the most important in the

59

first month of life (1). Among preterm infants, about 16% are born very preterm (<32 weeks of gestation)

60

(2). This condition is associated with a considerable risk to develop acute and chronic postnatal

61

morbidities and long-term neurodevelopmental disabilities (3). Indeed, up to 15% of very preterm infants

62

suffer from severe neurologic disorders, mainly related to the occurrence of acquired brain lesions (4)

63

and up to 50% of preterms experience other neurocognitive impairments in different areas of

64

development (e.g. language, behavior, visual processing, academic performances and executive

65

functions) (5, 6) or neuropsychological problems, including Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder

66

(ADHD) or Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) (7-10).

67

Neurodevelopmental delays may occur even in absence of overt acquired brain lesions and are most

68

likely caused by prematurity - related impairment in brain microstructural maturation and connectivity

69

(11-13). Besides the documented role played by gestational age (GA) at birth and by the occurrence

70

and severity of postnatal morbidities, the impact of early exposure to the hazards of extrauterine life

71

has been recently emphasized. Indeed, during their stay in Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU)

72

preterm infants face early environmental stress, mainly represented by the excessive neurosensory

73

stimulation and the prolonged separation from their parents (14, 15). Overall, these environmental

74

stressors act in a critical window of the preterm brain development (corresponding to the last trimester

75

of pregnancy and early postnatal life), in which multiple biological processes are taking place, including

76

the earliest myelination phase, neuronal circuit assembly, and synaptogenesis (16). Notably, there is a

77

4-fold increase in cerebral cortical volume during the last trimester, which is accompanied by a

78

significant increase in brain surface area, resulting in the formation of sulci and gyri of the cerebral

79

cortex (17). Cognitive and emotional processing relays on the proper development of the cerebral cortex

80

(which includes both the neocortex and the hippocampus) (18, 19). Alteration of the finely orchestrated

81

and precisely timed development of cortical and hippocampal neural circuits has been associated to

82

prominent long-term consequences in childhood and adulthood (20-22).

83

Interestingly, recent findings have highlighted the crucial role of parental care on modulating the

84

detrimental effects of early life exposure (23). Therefore, Developmental Care has been conceived as

85

a strategy to reduce NICU stressful factors and promote maternal engagement; it has been

86

demonstrated to improve brain maturation, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and

87

neurodevelopmental outcomes (24-26). More recently, Early Intervention strategies, based on a

88

multisensory stimulation approach, have been shown to promote infants’ visual acuity, neurobehavior

89

and brain development (27-29).

90

How these early life experiences can modulate at molecular level the brain architecture and, ultimately,

91

child’s behavior is still an unsolved issue. Interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated that neuronal

92

genomes are plastic in response to environmental cues; in particular, early maternal care can affect

93

genome structural variations in mouse hippocampus, thus resulting in somatic mosaicism that ultimately

94

generates neuronal diversity with potential effect on behavior (30-34).

95

Mobile DNA elements have the ability to change their genomic position, either by a DNA-based

96

(transposition) or RNA-based (retrotransposition) mechanism. Retrotransposition is one of the main

97

forms of somatic mosaicism in the brain (35). Among retrotransposable elements, LINE-1 (L1), that

98

covers about 18% of the human genome (36), has been extensively described to retrotranspose in

99

neurons from fly to humans (37-39), a mechanism that takes place during neural progenitor

100

development and differentiation (40-42). L1 can move to different genomic location (de novo insertion

101

site) by the activity of a reverse transcriptase (RTase), encoded by L1 itself, which reverse-transcribes

102

and integrates a L1 cDNA copy, that is usually 5’ end truncated (36).

103

L1 activity is finely modulated (42, 43) at the level of its endogenous promoter, where a CpG island

104

methylation/demethylation is associated with L1 somatic mobilization in the brain (43). Notably,

105

maternal care during early life has been reported to drive variability in L1 methylation and copy number

106

variations (CNVs) within the mouse hippocampal neuronal genome, influencing progeny behavior (31).

107

Similarly, childhood stress and adversities in early life have been reported to result in L1

108

hypomethylation (44, 45). Furthermore, the deregulation of L1 activity has been described in the brain

109

of debilitating neurological diseases as Rett syndrome (43, 46), schizophrenia (47, 48), autism (49),

110

bipolar and major depressive disorder (33, 50).

111

In the current study we combined analyses in humans and mice to test the hypothesis that an early

112

intervention program in very preterm infants, based on maternal care and enriched multisensory

113

stimulation, could modulate L1 dynamics in the developing brain and have a clinical readout on short-

114

term neurodevelopment.

RESULTS

117

Characteristics of study participants.

118

Overall, 70 very preterm infants born between 25+0 and 29+6 weeks of gestational age (GA) were

119

recruited and randomized either to receive Standard Care or Early Intervention (Standard Care n = 36,

120

Early Intervention n = 34) between April 2014 and January 2017 (Figure 1). Standard Care, in line with

121

NICU routine care protocols, included Kangaroo Mother Care and minimal handling. Early Intervention,

122

in addition to routine care, included a parental training program together with enriched multisensory

123

stimulation (infant massage and visual interaction, see Methods) promoted by parents as fully described

124

in (51). A daily diary was given to parents to record all the interventions performed and to retrospectively

125

quantify the effects of maternal care and multisensory stimulation. The study was conducted in a NICU

126

with open access to parents (24 hours a day for 7 days a week).

127

According to the protocol, 3 infants allocated to Early Intervention did not receive the treatment, as 2

128

infants developed surgical Necrotizing Enterocolitis (NEC) and 1 belonged to a family that became

129

single-parent after the enrollment (Figure 1). All infants in the Standard Care group received allocated

130

treatment as part of the routine clinical practice.

131

A schematic representation of the study timeline is provided in Figure 2. We harvested blood from 17

132

infants belonging to the Standard Care group and 20 to the Early Intervention group. Three infants

133

(Standard Care n=1, Early Intervention n=2) were subsequently excluded as samples were not usable

134

for molecular analyses (Figure 1). In details, L1 methylation analysis was carried out on 19 cord blood

135

samples collected at birth, named as “preterm” and 33 peripheral blood samples collected at discharge,

136

named as Standard Care (n=16) and Early Intervention (n=17). Baseline and perinatal characteristics

137

for the two groups are described in Table 1; no differences were observed among the groups in terms

138

of maternal and infant characteristics, or incidence of postnatal morbidities during NICU stay. Of note,

139

infants enrolled in the study were discharged around Term Equivalent Age (TEA) with no significant

140

differences between the two groups (Table 1).

141

In the Early Intervention group the massage therapy was started by parents at 31.7 ± 1.8 (mean±SD)

142

weeks of GA and carried out with a mean of 10.0 ± 2.1 times a week. Visual interaction was proposed

143

from 34.9 ± 0.8 weeks of GA, and performed with a mean of 7.1 ± 1.8 times a week.

144

In addition, 21 cord blood samples from healthy full-term infants, named as “full-term”, were collected

145

at birth (blood sample from 1 infant was excluded due to postnatal complications). Mother and infants’

Fontana C., Marasca F., et al.

146

characteristics of the full-term group were: mean maternal age at child birth 37.2 ± 3.8 years, mean GA

147

at birth 38.5 ± 0.5 weeks, mean birth weight 3234 ± 420 g and median Apgar score 9 at 1 minute and

148

10 at 5 minutes; 30% were males.

149
150

L1 promoter is hypomethylated in preterm infants at birth and its methylation level is restored

151

upon Early Intervention.

152

To assess L1 methylation level, we analyzed a region within L1 promoter, containing the CpG island

153

already reported to modulate L1 transcription and activity (42); this CpG island is constituted of 19 CpG,

154

of which CpG 11-19 are specifically involved in L1 regulation in the brain (Figure 3a, Neural specific

155

CpG 11-19) (42); moreover, YY1 transcription factor binding site, required for neural specific L1

156

expression, corresponds to CpG 17 (52) (Figure 3a).

157

L1 promoter methylation level was analyzed as described in Coufal et al. 2009 (42) (see Methods) in

158

the cord blood DNA of full-term (n=20) and preterm (n=19) neonates and in the peripheral blood DNA

159

of preterm infants at NICU discharge, subjected either to Standard Care (n=16) or Early Intervention

160

(n=17) (Figure 2 and Table 1). We found that L1 promoter methylation at birth was significantly lower

161

in preterm compared to full-term cord blood (Figure 3b and Supplemental Figure 1a-b); at NICU

162

discharge, L1 methylation levels were restored to level comparable to full-term infants only in the infants

163

belonging to the Early Intervention group (Figure 3b and Supplemental Figure 1a-d). L1 methylation

164

recovery in the Early Intervention group was specific for the neural region of the promoter (CpG 11-19)

165

(Figure 3c and Supplemental Figure 1e) and in particular for CpG 17 corresponding to YY1 binding site

166

(Supplemental Figure 1f).

167

Noteworthy, L1 promoter methylation level increases proportionally to the maternal care received upon

168

Early Intervention (average number of massages received per week, recorded by parents in daily diary)

169

(Figure 3d), a trend specifically observed for the neural region of L1 promoter (CpG 11-19) (Figure 3e)

170

and not for CpG 1-10 (Supplemental Figure 1g). L1 methylation levels did not reflect a global genome

171

methylation trend, as the promoter of a neuronal gene, NAB2 (NGFI-A binding protein 2), did not show

172

any difference in DNA methylation among the groups analyzed (Supplemental Figure 2a); moreover,

173

the observed differences were unrelated to different cord blood cellular composition between full-term

174

and preterm infants (Supplemental Figure 2b-c, see Methods).

176

L1 promoter methylation is dynamically regulated during hippocampus and cortex devolvement

177

in mice.

178

To analyze L1 promoter methylation during brain development, we dissected presumptive

179

somatosensory cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum from the mouse brain at multiple embryonic

180

(E15.5 and E18.5), early postnatal (P0, P3) and later developmental stages (P14) (Figure 4a). We

181

performed L1 methylation analysis as reported in Bedrosian et al (31) (see Methods) on L1MdTf family,

182

the most active and evolutionary young L1 subfamily in mice (53); L1MdTf 5’UTR is constituted by

183

several monomers, each containing a CpG island of 13 CpGs with a YY1 binding site corresponding

184

to the CpG 8 and 9 (54) (Figure 4b).

185

We observed that L1MdTf promoter methylation at the YY1 binding site had a peculiar trend along

186

hippocampus and cerebral cortex developmental trajectories, showing a wave of re-methylation at

187

E18.5 followed by progressive demethylation postnatally (Figure 4c). To assess whether these

188

dynamics were specific for L1 promoter, we analyzed IAPLTR1a (TEs belonging to ERV subfamilies)

189

methylation as reported in (31) (see Methods), and found no changes in any of the sampled areas

190

(Supplemental Figure 3a).

191

We next investigated whether the reduction in L1 methylation observed postnatally in mouse

192

hippocampus and cortex could correspond to an increased L1 CNVs. We measured L1 CNVs in

193

genomic DNA as reported in (42) (Figure 5a), treating the gDNA with Exonuclease I in order to avoid

194

the amplification of L1 cDNA intermediates (31) (Supplemental Fig 3b). Interestingly, we observed a

195

statistically significant increase in L1 CNVs specifically in hippocampus and cerebral cortex postnatally

196

(P0, P3, P14), in correspondence with the decrease in L1 promoter methylation (Figure 5b).

197

Overall, these results suggest that L1 activity is fine-tuned during hippocampus and cortical

198

development, and point at E18.5 as a sensitive and “vulnerable” developmental window for the

199

epigenetic setting of L1 methylation and activity regulation in these brain regions.

207

he presented extensive white matter damage at brain MRI performed at 40+0 GA.

208

All the preterm infants showed scores within the normal range; however, statistically significant

209

differences were observed between the 2 groups with the Early Intervention group showing higher

210

scores (Table 2) in the General Quotient and in 4 out of 5 subscales: Personal-Social (that measures

DISCUSSION

221

Here we report different L1 methylation patterns in preterm and full-term infants and we demonstrate

222

that L1 methylation status in preterm infants can be modulated by the beneficial effect of maternal care

223

and positive multisensory exposure. In addition, we demonstrate how the proposed early intervention

224

strategy positively modulates short-term infants’ neurodevelopment. In this regard, it is already reported

225

that maternal separation and excessive sensory exposure, induced by NICU environment, represent

226

adverse early life events experienced by preterm infants, that can affect the epigenetic regulation and

227

impact on gene expression in the brain (56-58).

228

Furthermore, previous studies have shown that L1 activity is modulated by early life experiences,

229

reflecting on neuronal somatic mosaicism and genomic structural variations of the mouse hippocampus

230

(30-34).

231

It is very well demonstrated that de novo L1 insertions are a developmentally regulated phenomenon

232

that contributes to somatic mosaicism in the brain (59, 60). New L1 insertions could have an

233

evolutionary adaptive significance, offering new genomic instruments to evolve into new phenotypes;

234

an idea corroborated by the finding that new insertions land in neuronal specific active genes (37-39,

235

47). Moreover, L1 deregulated activity is now emerging as a potential mechanism that correlates with

236

the development of several mental disorders including schizophrenia, autism spectrum disorders

237

(ASD), major depression (43, 47, 50, 59, 61), which are also often described in former preterm infants

238

(62). In this context, in the animal model we detected L1 CNVs as an early event (P0, P3) in

239

hippocampus and cerebral cortex that match the progressive demethylation of L1 promoter after E18.5

240

stage. This suggests that in the mice E18.5 represents a susceptible time window in which L1

241

methylation status resets, soon before birth (Figure 4 and 5); it is tempting to speculate that similar

242

dynamics could occur also in human brain development, although with a different timing.

243

Interestingly, hippocampus and the interconnected thalamus and cortex are known to be affected by

244

preterm birth to an extent proportional to the degree of prematurity (13, 63) and to the premature

245

exposure to the extrauterine environment (64, 65), highlighting how preterm birth disrupts specific

246

aspects of cerebral development. Notably, these cerebral areas, in particular the hippocampus, are

247

well-known for their involvement in socio-emotional development, functioning and memory (66).

248

However, the relationship between the structural changes observed by neuroimaging studies in preterm

249

infants, and the impairments in memory and learning that they manifest in childhood, are still debated

250

(64) as well as the underlying pathogenetic mechanisms. No significant changes in L1 methylation and

251

activity were observed in the cerebellum, although the third trimester of pregnancy is a highly dynamic

252

period for cerebellar development which, in humans, follows a precisely programmed series of

253

regionally- and temporally-specific (67) developmental processes (68). Different molecular mechanisms

254

involved in these maturational processes or different time windows of vulnerability might explain this

255

finding (67).

256

We described that L1 methylation levels are lower in preterm infants at birth and that they are properly

257

restored only upon Early Intervention at NICU discharge, a recovery that specifically involve the YY1

258

binding site region. YY1 binding site methylation has been recently demonstrated to regulate L1

259

retrotransposition (52) and to be modulated by maternal care, (31) in turn altering L1 activity in mouse

260

neural hippocampal genome (31). We can speculate that the specific alteration of L1 methylation that

261

premature infants experience, and, more importantly, the inability to recover a proper L1 methylation

262

setting could influence L1 activity, leading to aberrant L1 retrotransposition, as already demonstrated

263

for several neurological disabilities (43, 47, 50, 59, 61).

264

We further demonstrate that the Early Intervention program enhances neurodevelopment at 12 months

265

corrected age compared to Standard Care, albeit scores are within the normal range for both groups.

266

The clinical relevance of these short-term results needs to be confirmed later in childhood when

267

neurobehavioral and cognitive impairments become more obvious, although studies on the

268

neurodevelopmental trajectories of preterm infants have suggested the predictive value of the 12

269

months’ assessment on long-term outcomes (69).

270

In conclusion, we are providing evidence that L1 methylation and activity are tightly developmentally

271

controlled, being specifically influenced by the early life experiences of premature infants; this study

272

sheds a new light on the epigenetic mechanisms related to a premature exposure to the extrauterine

273

life and suggests that preterm birth affects the dynamic of L1 methylation. Early intervention strategies

274

based on maternal care and positive sensory stimulation during a sensitive window of both epigenetic

275

and brain plasticity might modulate L1 DNA methylation and contribute to shape the developing brain

276

connections with potential impact on infants’ neurodevelopment.

METHODS

279

Study Cohort

280

All the preterm infants consecutively born between 25+0 and 29+6 weeks of gestational age (GA) at the

281

same institution were eligible. Exclusion criteria: multiple pregnancy (triplets or higher), genetic

282

syndromes and/or malformations, infants who developed severe neonatal comorbidities including

283

severe brain lesions. The full study protocol is described in (51). Adherence to the early intervention

284

protocol was required and documented in a parental self-report diary.

285
286

Animals

287

CD-1 mice were housed under controlled conditions for temperature and humidity, using a 12:12-h light-

288

dark cycle. Mice were mated overnight, and females were separated the following morning and checked

289

for vaginal plugs (Embryonic day, E 0,5). CD-1 animals deliver pups between day E19 - E20. Caesarean

290

sections (C-secs) were performed at embryonic days E15.5, E18.5 and P0. Pups were sacrificed by

291

decapitation at different time points: at embryonic day E15.5, E18.5 and at postnatal day P0, P3 and

292

P14. At each developmental stage, 4 mice were sacrificed and brains collected to manually

293

microdissect hippocampal, cortical and cerebellar tissue under a stereomicroscope in sterile conditions.

294

Microdissected tissues were store at -80°C until gDNA extraction was performed.

295
296

Study design

297

Infants were randomly assigned either to receive (i) Standard Care or (ii) an additional Early Intervention

298

protocol based on maternal care. Standard Care, according to the routine clinical protocol of the NICU,

299

included Kangaroo Mother Care, minimal handling and non-pharmacological pain management. The

300

Early Intervention protocol included, over routine clinical care, the PremieStart (70), which is based on

301

parental involvement, and enriched multisensory stimulation proposed by parents after a period of

302

training. This intervention included both tactile stimulation, through infant massage, performed twice a

303

day and visual interaction provided once a day with a black and white toy or parents’ face. A complete

304

detailed description of the intervention is available in (51).

305

The randomization was performed using sealed envelopes prepared in groups of 10 through computer-

306

generated randomization. The randomization sequence was concealed until the group allocation was

307

assigned, and the examiners (both biologist and psychologist that performed the follow-up examination)

308

remained blinded for the entire study period.

309

The present study is part of a larger Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) aimed at assessing the

310

effectiveness of an Early Intervention program in promoting visual function and neurodevelopment in

311

preterm infants. Within this context, exploratory analyses have been performed to investigate the effect

312

of preterm birth and early interventions on L1 modulation.

313
314

Sample Collection

315

In preterm infants, cord blood samples were collected at birth and peripheral blood samples were

316

harvested at hospital discharge (around term equivalent age - TEA). Peripheral blood was obtained

317

during blood sampling performed for routine blood examination, according to clinical practice.

318

In healthy full-term infants’ cord blood samples were collected at birth only in infants born by C-section

319

after uneventful pregnancies. Each sample consisted of 0.5 mL of cord/peripheral blood.

320
321

Neurodevelopmental assessment

322

At 12 months corrected age the preterm infants group underwent the Griffiths Mental Development

323

Scales (GMDS) to asses neurodevelopment (71). This evaluation comprises five subscales (score

324

range 50–150): Locomotor, Personal-Social, Hearing and Speech, Eye and Hand Coordination and

325

Performance. The subscales yield standardized scores for each domain (mean ± SD: 100 ± 16) and a

326

composite General Quotient (mean ± SD: 100 ± 12).

327
328

DNA extraction

329

Genomic DNA from human cord and peripheral blood, from mouse hippocampus, cortex and

330

cerebellum was isolated with standard phenol-chloroform extraction techniques.

331
332

Bisulfite conversion

333

500 ng of genomic DNA from each sample were bisulfite-treated using the MethylEdge™ Bisulfite

334

Conversion System (Promega, Madison, USA) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

337

The methylation analysis of CpG island within the human L1 promoter were conducted as reported in

338

(42) with minor modifications. The primer sequences are the following:

339

hL1-5’UTR For: 5’ - AAGGGGTTAGGGAGTTTTTTT – 3’

340

hL1-5’UTR Rev: 5’ - TATCTATACCCTACCCCCAAAA – 3’

341

In each PCR, 40 ng of bisulfite-converted DNA were combined with primers at 0.5 μM final concentration

342

and GoTaq™ Hot Start Green Master Mix (Promega) in a final volume of 50 μL. PCR conditions were

343

as follows: 95°C for 2 minutes followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 45 seconds, 56 °C for 1 minute and

344

72°C for 30 seconds, followed by a final step of 72°C hold for 4 minutes.

345

The product of amplification is 363 bp of length and contains 19 CpGs. The resulting PCR products

346

were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and then purified by PureLink ™ Quick Gel Extraction &

347

PCR Purification Combo Kit (Invitrogen- Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). They were then cloned into

348

pGEM-T Easy Vector System I (Promega) using a molar ratio insert: vector of 6:1. Sanger sequencing

349

was performed by GATC Biotech, using the reverse sequencing primer pGEM Seq Rev: 5’-

350

GACCATGATTACGCCAAGCTA – 3’. Resulting chromatograms were examined for sequencing quality

351

using FinchTV software. At least 10 sequenced clones per sample were analyzed for Figure 3 and

352

Supplemental Figure 1 and at least 11 clones per sample were analyzed in Supplemental Figure 2b

353

and c as suggested in (72).

354

The methylation analysis of CpG island within the Nab2 promoter region were conducted designing

355

specific primers with MethPrimer (73), whose sequences are as follows:

356

Nab2 For: 5’ - GAGGGAGGGATAGAGTTTGGAT - 3’

357

Nab2 Rev: 5’ - ACGCTCTATACATAAACGACCGA - 3’

358

In each PCR, 80ng of bisulfite-converted DNA were combined with primers at 0.5 μM final concentration

359

and GoTaq™ Hot Start Green Master Mix (Promega), in a final volume of 50 μL. PCR conditions were

360

as follows: 95°C for 4 minutes followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 45 seconds, 58 °C for 1:30 minutes

361

and 72°C for 2 minutes, followed by a final step of 72°C hold for 4 minutes.

362

The product of amplification is 135-bp amplicon and contains 15 CpGs. The resulting PCR products

363

were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and then purified by PureLink ™ Quick Gel Extraction &

364

PCR Purification Combo Kit (Invitrogen- Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Once purified, they were

365

cloned into pGEM- T Easy Vector System I (Promega) using a molar ratio insert: vector of 6:1. Sanger

370

Analysis of Sanger sequencing in human samples

371

To analyze the conversion efficiency and the methylation status of the CpG sites, FASTAQ files were

372

analyzed by QUMA (QUantification tool for Methylation Analysis) software (CDB, Riken, Japan) (74).

373

For the L1 promoter methylation, we excluded from the analysis three (CpG 2, 6 and 9) of the 19 CpGs

374

due to the high degree of variability among the analyzed sequences compared to the consensus

375

sequence used (L19092.1 Human LINE1 (L1.4)). Sequences with a >90% of cytosine residues

376

converted were used for subsequent analisys. Total percent methylation was calculated as the number

377

of methylated CpGs divided by the number of total CpGs (both methylated and unmethylated) multiplied

378

by 100. To determine the methylation status of each CpG site, we calculated the percentage of

379

methylation of each CpG site as the number of methylation events at a specific CpG site divided by the

380

total number of sequenced and analyzed clones.

381
382

Methylation assay in mouse samples

383

The methylation analysis of CpG island within the murine L1MdTf monomer and IAPLTR1a were

384

conducted as reported in (31) with minor modifications. Given the peculiar monomeric and highly

385

repeated nature of the mouse L15’UTR we performed this methylation analysis with a Next Generation

386

sequences approach. A detailed list of primer sequences used for the amplification is reported in

387

Supplemental Table I. Briefly both for L1MdTf monomer and IAPLTR1a we used primers with Illumina

388

barcode index (Illumina Truseq LT 6-mer indices): each organ in each developmental stage was

389

associated to a distinct couple of Fow and Rev primers 5’ end tagged, in order to be unambiguously

390

identified in the sequencing analysis step (see Supplemental Table I).

391

Each PCR was performed with 16 ng – 40 ng of bisulfite-converted DNA were combined with primers

392

at 0.5 μM final concentration and GoTaq™ Hot Start Green Master Mix (Promega) in a final volume of

393

50 μL. PCR conditions were as follows: 95°C for 2 minutes followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 45

394

seconds; 56 °C for 1 minute and 72°C for 5 seconds, followed by a final step of 72°C hold for 4 minutes.

395

For L1MdTf monomer the product of amplification is 191-bp of length and contains 13 CpGs while for

396

IAPLTR1a the product of amplification is 205 bp of length and contains 10 CpGs. The resulting PCR

397

products were checked by agarose gel electrophoresis and then purified by Agencourt AMPure XP

398

beads (Beckman Coulter) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA concentration were

399

quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit. All the L1MdTf and IAPLTR1a amplicons were then

400

pooled in equimolar quantities to obtain a final pooling concentration of 2 ng/μL. Library for DNA

401

sequencing was produced on the pooled PCRs. Paired-end 2 x 150bp sequencing was performed on

402

a HiSeq platform (Illumina) by Eurofins GATC Biotech.

403
404

Analysis of NGS sequencing in mouse samples

405

A total of 22,481,000 reads were obtained from bisulfite sequencing and were assigned to samples

406

based on the primers with Illumina barcode index. Briefly, no mismatch was allowed for the barcode

407

index and a maximum of 5 mismatches were allowed for the target primer. None of the reads

408

assigned to IAPLTR1a target aligned on L1MdTf and vice versa. Prior to mapping, reads were

409

trimmed for low quality using Trimmomatic (75)

410

PE.fa:2:30:10 LEADING:3 TRAILING:3 SLIDINGWINDOW:4:15 MINLEN:75). 15,368,000 reads

411

were obtained post trimming with an average of 80,000 reads for each sample. The paired reads

412

were mapped using Bismark (76) (parameters: --local -N 1 -L 15 --non_directional) with an average

413

mapping

414

(https://github.com/dpryan79/MethylDackel). Sample correlation analysis was performed using

415

methylKit (77) and all biological replicates of a given organ within a developmental stage showed a

416

correlation higher than 95%. Methylation analysis for L1MdTf was focused on the YY1 binding site,

417

corresponding to the CpG sites 8 and 9, as reported by (31) and on four CpG sites for IAPLTR1a,

418

as reported by (31). Briefly, methylation status of each CpG site, was calculated as the number of

419

methylation events at a specific CpG site divided by the total number of analyzed sequences. Sample

420

methylation level was calculated as the number of methylated CpGs divided by the number of total

421

CpGs (both methylated and unmethylated) multiplied by 100.

of digestion was proved on 300ng of gDNA equimolar pooled with 300 ng of a 120 bp ssDNA

428

oligonucleotide (Supplemental Figure 3c). Digested DNA was further subjected to phenol-chloroform

429

purification. Extracted DNA was quantified using Qbit HS DNA kit (Invitrogen) and diluted to a

430

concentration of 80 pg/µL.

431

Quantitative PCR experiments were performed on a StepOne Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with minor

432

modifications to the method reported in (42). In each multiplexed PCR two TaqMan probes, labeled

433

FAM and VIC, were combined; 80 pg of genomic DNA was combined with gene-specific primers,

434

TaqMan-MGB probes and 10 μL of iQ multiplex PowerMix (Biorad) in a total volume of 20 μL. Primers’

435

concentration was 0.4 μM and TaqMan probes’ concentration 0.4 μM. PCR conditions were as follows:

436

95°C for 2 minutes followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 10 seconds and 59°C for 60 seconds.

437

Standard curves of genomic DNA ranging from 200 ng to 0.2 ng were performed to verify that the 80

438

pg dilution was within the linear range of the reaction. For CNVs, the quantification includes from five

439

to eight technical replicates. For assays on mouse genome, we adapted a TaqMan probe for the same

440

amplicon reported in (31, 43). Probes’ and primers’ sequences are reported below:

441

FACS analysis and isolation of PBMCs populations

449

Fresh cord blood samples derived from full-term and preterm were subjected to erythrocytes lysis

450

following manufacturer’s instruction (BD lysis buffer). PBMCs (Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells)

451

were then stained with anti CD45 for 30 minutes at 37°C, different mononuclear subpopulations were

452

identified gating on CD45 and SSC as described in (78). Most abundant populations as granulocytes

453

and lymphocytes were then sorted to be further subjected to DNA methylation analysis. granulocytes

454

were sorted as the population CD45 high with the highest SSC while lymphocytes were sorted as the

455

population CD45 high with the lowest SSC.

STATISTICAL METHODS

468

Demographic and baseline characteristics were described as mean ± SD, median and range or number

469

and percentage. Independent t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used in the comparison of

470

continuous variables with normal distribution and non-normal distribution respectively. For the

471

comparison of qualitative data, Fisher’s exact test was used. Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the

472

normal distribution of the data. To assess the differences between full-term and preterm infants, and

473

between treatment groups in total L1 methylation and on each CpG, unpaired t-test and two-way

474

ANOVA model with Tukey's HSD post-hoc tests were used. Linear regression model was used to study

475

the relationship between L1 methylation at NICU discharge and the intensity of care (mean number of

476

massages per week) and independent t-test and Mann-Whitney U test were used to assess the

477

difference in 12 months neurodevelopment between Standard Care and Early Intervention groups.

478

Mouse brain regions' methylation at different stages of development were analyzed using one-way

479

ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc tests. All tests were two-tailed, and p < 0.05 was considered

480

significant for all tests. Statistical analyses were performed using R version 3.5.3 (R Foundation for

481

Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).

Figure 5. L1 CNVs early postnatally increase in mouse hippocampus and cortex.

741

a) Schematic representation of L1 CNV assay performed on mouse hippocampus, cortex and

742

cerebellum. Briefly, the assay is performed in multiplex qPCR, using Taqman probes specific for mL1-

743

ORF2 and m5S as reported in (42). b) L1 CNV assay performed on mouse hippocampus, cortex and

744

cerebellum at different stages of embryonic (E15.5, E18.5) and postnatal development (P0, P3, P14).

745

For each organ and developmental stage, genomic DNA samples from the 4 mice (same as in Figure

746

4) were analyzed. mL1-ORF2 was normalized on m5S. Hippocampus: E15.5 vs P3, p = 0.006; E15.5

747

vs P14, p = 0.000; E18.5 vs P3, p = 0.012; E18.5 vs P14, p = 0.000; P0 vs P14, p = 0.004. Cortex:

748

E15.5 vs P3, p = 0.018; E15.5 vs P14, p = 0.000; E18.5 vs P3, p =0.047; E18.5 vs P14, p = 0.000; P0

749

vs P14, p = 0.000, ANOVA with Tukey post hoc test. Data are represented as mean ± s.e.m.
