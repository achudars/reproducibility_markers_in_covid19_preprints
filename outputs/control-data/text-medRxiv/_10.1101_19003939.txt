Background and Aim: Although the challenges of integrating palliative care practices

24

across care settings are real and well recognized until now little is known about palliative

25

care practice of emergency physicians (EPs) and their accessibility to palliative care services

26

in Kuwait. So the aim of this study was to explore the attitude, and knowledge encountered

27

by EPs in providing palliative care in all general hospitals in Kuwait.

28

Method: A cross-sectional survey was performed in the emergency rooms of all general

29

hospitals in Kuwait using Palliative Care Attitude and Knowledge (PCAK) questionnaire.

30

Results: Of the total number of physicians working in emergency rooms (n=156), 104

31

(66.67%) had completed the survey. 76.9% (n=80) of the EPs had either uncertain attitude

32

toward palliative care. Most of the EPs (n=73, 70.28%) didn’t discuss the need of the patients

33

to palliative care either with the patients or their families. Only 16 (15.4%) of the EPs

34

responded correctly to the most of the questions while nearly half of the EPs (n=51, 49%) had

35

poor knowledge especially in the most effective management of refractory dysnea (n=18,

36

17.3%). Experience ≥ 11yrs and better knowledge scores were independent predictors of

37

positive attitude after adjustment of age, sex, qualifications, specialty, position, and

38

nationality [OR: 5.747 (CI: 1.031-25.00), 1.458(CI: 1.148-1.851); p-value: 0.021, 0.002

39

respectively]..

40

Conclusions: Despite recognizing palliative care as an important competence, the majority of

41

the emergency physicians in Kuwait had uncertain attitude and poor knowledge towards

42

palliative care. Lack of knowledge, direct accessibility to palliative care services and lack of

43

support from palliative medicine specialists were the main reasons for uncertain and negative

44

attitude. Efforts should be done to enhance physician training and provide palliative care

45

resources in order to improve the quality of care given to patients visiting emergency

46

departments.

Introduction:

59

Emergency medicine is a medical specialty that is concerned with stabilization of

60

patients with acute illness or injury for definitive care.1 in this specialty, emergency

61

physicians are trained to provide acute treatments for emergency medical conditions aiming

62

at preserving patients’ life regardless of their wellbeing.1,2

63

While patients and their families under palliative care can experience stressful and

64

overwhelming moments during the disease trajectory such as sudden respiratory distress,

65

severe pain, vomiting, confusion and many other symptom,3 the first point of access is often

66

the emergency room. Unfortunately, many of them die in the hospitals despite their wish to

67

die at home.4 Hospitals; where palliative medicine specialists are available; can provide the

68

opportunity for the patients and their families to establish their preferences for care and to

69

coordinate the aggressiveness of treatment, symptom management, and place of death.3, 4

70

Moreover, early palliative care consultation was shown to improve quality of life for

71

cancer patients and may even lengthen their survival.5 Most recently, studies proved that the

72

emergency room may be a suitable place for early referral of patients who may benefit from

73

palliative care

74

deaths.7

6

especially old age to prevent upcoming undesired admissions and hospital

75

The integration of palliative care concepts and consultation teams into emergency

76

medicine may help to avoid unnecessary and burdensome treatments, tests, and procedures

77

that are not aligned with patients’ goals of care.

78

palliative care practices across care settings are real and well recognized until now little is known

79

about palliative care practice of emergency physicians and their accessibility to palliative care

80

services in Kuwait. Recently, a newly developed tool called Palliative Care Attitude and Knowledge

81

(PCAK) questionnaire was created to assess the attitude and knowledge of non-palliative physicians

2

Although the challenges of integrating

82

toward palliative care.8 So the aim of this study was to explore the attitude, and knowledge

83

encountered by emergency physicians in providing palliative care using PCAK

84

departments in all general hospitals in Kuwait.

85

Method:

86

Study design and setting:

8

in emergency

87

A cross-sectional survey was performed in the emergency rooms of all general

88

hospitals under the Ministry of Health of Kuwait. This includes six general hospitals; Al-

89

Sabah, Al-Jahra, Al-Amiri, Al-Adan, Al-Farawanyia and Mubarak Al-Kabeer hospitals.

90

Measurements and intervention:

91

Palliative Care Attitude and Knowledge Questionnaire (PCAK):8

92

It is a newly developed questionnaire composed of three sections. Section one

93

includes demographic data such as age, sex, level of education, work experience, workplace,

94

medical subspecialty and palliative care experience. Section two is assessing the attitude and

95

formed of 11 items. The tool had a 5 point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to

96

strongly agree (5). Negative or unfavorable attitude was considered if the participant scored

97

=<25, uncertain attitude if scored >25 but <41, positive or favorable attitude if scored > =41.

98

The third section inquiries about knowledge. It includes 2 parts; the first part was about the

99

self-reported knowledge (3 questions) and the second part is 12 clinical questions. Regarding

100

self-knowledge, 5 points likert scale was used ranging from excellent response (5) to none

101

(1). Regarding basic knowledge scoring; Poor knowledge was calculated if participant scored

102

less than 50% of the total score (12 points) (=<5 points), fair knowledge if >=50% to= <75%

103

(6-9 points), good knowledge if scored >75% (>=10 points). 8

104

Selection of Participants:

105

The questionnaires were disturbed to all emergency physicians in all general

106

hospital in Kuwait (Figure 1) and recollected back by hand to hand and revised within 48

107

hours. The flowchart of the sampling procedure was presented in Figure 1.

108

Ethical statement:

109

The approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of the Ministry of Health

110

was taken prior to the study (No.210/2016, March 2016). Informed consent was obtained

111

from all participants. Participants’ anonymity and confidentiality were kept throughout all

112

phases of the study. Approvals were also obtained from participating emergency departments

113

of all general hospitals.

114

Statistical analysis:

115

All data manipulation and analysis were performed using the SPSS (Statistical

116

Package for Social Science) SPSS version 20. P-values less than 0.05 were regarded as a sign

117

of statistical significance. Independent sample t-test was used for comparison between

118

quantitative data. Chi-square test or Fisher’s Exact when appropriate were used to compare

119

between qualitative variables. Generalized linear method was used to find out the

120

independent predictors of positive attitude toward palliative care with adjustment of any

121

confounding factors. We used the consolidated criteria for reporting observational studies

122

(RECORD) checklist as far as this was applicable to our study.

125

Of the total number of physicians working in emergency rooms in Kuwait (n=156

126

physicians), 19 physicians were on annual leave and 11 physicians refused to participate. The

127

remaining 126 emergency physicians who responded to the questionnaire, 104 (82.54%) had

128

completed the survey in all general hospitals. (Figure1). The number of participants was 15

129

(14.2%) from AlSabah hospital, 20 (19.2%) from Al-Amiri hospital, 18 (20%) from Mubarak

130

Al-Kabeer hospital, 20 (17.33%) from Al-Farawanyia hospital, 14 (13.5%) from Al-Adan

131

hospital and 17 (20.44%) from Al-Jahrah hospital. (Figure 1).

132

86.6% (n=90) were males and 13.5% (n=14) were females and mean age of the

133

respondents was 38.83±9.5 years old. The median years of experience were 11 (IQR: 7-13)

134

years. Due to the diversity of population demographics, only 20.19% (n=21) were Kuwaiti

135

physicians. Most of respondents had postgraduate emergency medicine studies (n=68;

136

65.4%), followed by internal medicine studies (12; 11.5%). (Table 1).

137

Main results:

138

Only 18.3% (n=19) of the emergency physicians had a favorable attitude towards

139

palliative care. Most of them had uncertain attitude (76.9%, n=80) and 4.8% (n=5) had an

140

unfavorable attitude. Most of them agreed about the need of all adults and children who are

141

terminally ill for palliative care services, not just those with cancer (Q7: n =65; 62.5%) and

142

approved also that palliative care benefits include enhanced quality of life for the patient and

143

family (Q9:n=81; 77.9%), skilled care for terminally ill patients (Q10: n=82; 78.8%), and

144

expert pain and symptom management (Q11: n=85; 81.7%). Unfortunately, they emphasized

145

onthe lack of timely communication between palliative care providers and themselves (Q2:

146

n=71; 68.3%). Many of them dissatisfied with palliative care services in the past (Q1: n=61;

147

58.7%), reported unfamiliarity with the currently available palliative care services (Q3: n=65;

148

62.5%), and its types (Q5:n=54; 51.9%). Moreover, the uncertainty about its length of

149

coverage was 53.8% (Q4: n=56). Generally, the emergency physicians with experience ≥11

150

years had statistically significant better attitude scores than the emergency physicians with

151

experience <11 (p value=0.019, Figure 2) but in most of the individualized items of the

152

attitude, no statistically significant between them.

153

Most of the emergency physicians (n=73, 70.28%) didn’t discuss the need of the

154

patients to palliative care either with the patients or their families. 44 (42.3%) of them

155

reported no or little knowledge in pain assessment and management, while 58 (55.8%) and 41

156

(39.4%) reported good knowledge in other symptoms assessment and management, and the

157

counseling respectively. Neither years of experience nor nationality had any statically

158

significant effect on self-assessment of their knowledge and experience of the emergency

159

physicians towards palliative care. (Table 1).

160

The overall percentage of the emergency physicians that responded correctly to the

161

most of the questions about the basic knowledge of palliative care was only 16 (15.4%) while

162

37 (35.6%) had a fair knowledge and unfortunately many of them (n=51; 49%) responded to

163

> 50% of the questions incorrectly. The median number of total corrected answers was 6

164

(IQR: 4-8) out of 12. Surprisingly, none of the emergency physicians answered all the

165

questions correctly. An overview of the questions and their answers was presented in Table 3.

166

Q11 for the symptoms of cord compression was the one with the highest percentage of

167

correct answers (Q11: n=94; 90.4%) while Q8 about the most effective treatment for the

168

refractory dyspnea question had the lowest rate of correct answers (Q8:n=18;17.3%). They

169

had mostly poor to fair knowledge regarding opioids handling; such as types of opioids

170

(Q3:n=57;54.8%), World Health Organization ladder for pain management (Q7:

171

n=39;37.5%), opioids toxicity (Q8:n=31; 29.8%), use of oral opioids (Q15:n=19; 18.3%); and

172

delirium (Q4:n=62; 59.65%) and management of catastrophic bleeding in palliative setting

173

(Q10:n=20; 19.2%).

174

Most of the emergency physicians had good knowledge scores regarding the

175

differences between traditional and palliative care (Q1: n=79; 76%) and the multidisciplinary

176

team role in palliative care (Q2:n=83; 79.8%). No statistically significant differences between

177

years of experience of the emergency physicians and their knowledge scores (Figure 3) in

178

most of the questions except palliative care definitions and signs of opioid toxicity in which

179

the emergency physicians with less experience answered significantly better (86% vs 66.7%,

180

40% vs 20.4%; p-value: 0.024, 0.029 respectively) while in diagnosis of superior venous

181

obstruction, the emergency physicians with more years of experience answered better (12%

182

vs 35.2%; p-value: 0.011). No statistically significant differences between the emergency

183

physicians from different hospitals in the attitude or knowledge scores or demographic

184

characteristics. (Table 4).

185

By using generalized linear method to find out the independent predictors of positive

186

attitude toward palliative care, we found that years of experience ≥ 11 yrs and better

187

knowledge scores were independent predictors of positive attitude after adjustment of age,

188

sex, qualifications, specialty, position, and nationality [OR: 5.747 (CI: 1.031-25.00),

189

1.458(CI: 1.148-1.851); p-value: 0.021, 0.002 respectively]. (Table 5)

190

Discussion

191

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey of its kind conducted in Kuwait

192

to evaluate palliative care attitude and knowledge targeting the emergency physicians

193

anywhere in the entire region. We used PCAK which is a newly developed validated and

194

reliable tool 8 to assess the attitude and knowledge among physicians. There are more than

195

150 physicians working in the emergency rooms in 6 hospitals distributed all over Kuwait.

196

Most of them had uncertain attitude and poor knowledge scores. Better knowledge scores and

197

experience ≥11 yrs were positive predictors of favorable attitude. Although more than 10

198

different nationalities are existing in Kuwait like Egyptians, Syrians, Pakistanis, Indians, and

199

others from different cultures, emergency rooms demographic, medical education, specialties,

200

years of experience but no statically significant differences between them in their knowledge

201

or attitude toward palliative care. This differed from many studies which reported that

202

clinician attitudes or knowledge were affected by nationality, physicians’ position, staff type,

203

years of experience, emergency rooms demographic and hospital type.9

204

In our study, 76.9% of the emergency physicians had either uncertain attitude toward

205

palliative care while only 18.3% had a favorable or positive attitude. This was mainly due to

206

either dissatisfaction about PC services, types, accessibility, length of coverage and lastly

207

lack of timely communication between them and palliative care providers as reported in our

208

study. These results is similar to the original results of PCAK questionnaire.8 Many factors

209

affecting the attitude of the emergency physicians depending on their diverse experiences,

210

which ranged from positive, encouraging to a negative and distressing expiernce.9,10 This

211

includes sometimes a sense of incompetence to alter the course of the disease

212

anxious and uncomfortable about discussing death and dying with the terminally ill

213

patient.12,13 This negative attitude can hinder the quality of care provision especially at the

214

end of life.

3, 11

or feeling

215

Most of the emergency physicians (n=73, 70.28%) didn’t discuss the need to

216

palliative care either with the patients or their families. The willingness to engage in end-of-

217

life discussions becomes key to improve palliative care in the emergency department.14, 15

218

However, palliative care referrals remain largely underutilized in all areas of healthcare and

219

are characteristically initiated late in the disease trajectory.16,17 Furthermore, most of the

220

emergency physicians feel that it is not their obligation to discuss the need for palliative care

221

and they feel that the family physicians or the oncologists are the one who is responsible

222

about this discussion.3,18

223

Nearly half of the emergency physicians (49%) had poor knowledge. Although many

224

of them subjectively reported good knowledge in counseling and other symptoms (rather than

225

pain) assessment and management and they strongly agreed that palliative care is an

226

important competence for emergency physicians 3,18 but it wasn’t necessarily reflected in their

227

effectiveness of care especially in view of their poor knowledge at most. These results is

228

similar to the original results of PCAK questionnaire.8

229

They had mostly poor knowledge in opioids handling, delirium and management of

230

catastrophic bleeding in the palliative setting. This is similar to many studies that reported a

231

lack of knowledge in palliative care, especially pain management proficiency.18-20

232

The setting of emergency rooms; as crowded spaces, noisy environment,

233

compromised privacy, frequent interruptions, time constraints, illness complexity, and

234

medico-legal threats; 21,22 make the initiation of palliative care discussions less than ideal in

235

these settings.

236

diminishing patients’ or families’ hope, or believing that patients are not prepared to hear

237

forthcoming information make physicians often hesitate to discuss patients prognosis either

238

with the patients or their families.22 Subsequently, aggressive interventions often initiated

239

may ultimately be misaligned with overall goals of care although retrospectively viewed as

240

futile, harmful, and painful.23 In reality, the culture of emergency setting that provides

241

stabilization of acute medical emergencies was sometimes at odds with the culture of

242

palliative care, which balances quality of life with the burdens of invasive treatments.2,18

3,22

Unfortunately, being not confident with the diagnosis and concerns of

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19003939; this version posted August 20, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

243

In our study, good knowledge was positively associated with the positive attitude of

244

the emergency physicians toward palliative care. This was agreed with Thulesius et al. who

245

revealed that good knowledge of staff significantly improved attitudes toward the end of life

246

care and the authors suggested initiatives to educate physicians working in ED’s will help

247

them to change their negative attitudes and contribute better quality of patient care. 24

248

Many studies reported a significant correlation between the level of knowledge and

249

attitudes towards palliative care. This is highlighting that as participants' level of knowledge

250

increased, attitudes become more positive in hospitals such as in Lebanon,25 Ethiopia,26

251

Saudi Arabia,27 and India.28 As a part of human nature, the degree and complexity of their

252

knowledge affect their attitudes and in turn their behavior.29

253

The effective measurement of knowledge and attitude of the physicians is an important

254

component of the evaluation of education and practice especially if used prior to any

255

educational activity or program. This would result in more willingness to contribute in

256

discussion and generate greater receptivity to the educational materials.30,31 Again it can be

257

applied post activity to document the change in their knowledge and attitude and at the same

258

time to evaluate the efficiency of the training and educational program.

259

Strength and limitation of the study:

260

It is the first study to assess the knowledge and attitude of the emergency physicians

261

toward palliative care in the entire region. All the emergency physicians in Kuwait were

262

involved in the research with no selection bias. The scarcity of similar studies carried out in

263

Kuwait, Eastern Mediterranean region and in other parts of the world made the comparison

264

and discussion difficult. Palliative care is recently introduced in Kuwait and it is still in the

265

phase of development with the shortage of the number of the available palliative medicine

266

267

Despite recognizing palliative care as an important competence, the majority of the

268

emergency physicians in Kuwait had uncertain attitude and poor knowledge towards

269

palliative care. Lack of knowledge, direct accessibility to palliative care services and lack of

270

support from palliative medicine specialists were the main reasons for uncertain and negative

271

attitude.

272

Conclusion:

273

Despite recognizing palliative care as an important competence, the majority of the

274

emergency physicians in Kuwait had uncertain attitude and poor knowledge towards

275

palliative care. Lack of knowledge, direct accessibility to palliative care services and lack of

276

support from palliative medicine specialists were the main reasons for uncertain and negative

277

attitude. Efforts should be done to enhance physician training and provide palliative care

278

resources in order to improve the quality of care given to patients visiting emergency

279

departments. Attention should be given to palliative care by the national health policy. There

280

is an urgent need to be incorporated into the national curriculum of medical students and the

281

emergency physicians’ education. Further efforts are needed to push the palliative care across

282

different healthcare sectors.

283
