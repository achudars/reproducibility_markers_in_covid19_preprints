Abstract
Objective: Diagnostic genetic testing is recommended for children with
neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). However, many children with NDDs do not
receive genetic testing. One approach to improve access to genetic services for these
patients is to offer testing on the inpatient child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) service.
Methods: We implemented systematic genetic testing on an inpatient CAP service by
providing medical genetics education to CAP fellows. We compared the genetic testing
rates pre- and post-education. We compared the diagnostic yield to previously published
studies and the demographics of our cohort to inpatients who received genetic testing on
other clinical services. We assessed rates of outpatient genetics follow-up post-discharge.
Results: The genetic testing rate on the inpatient CAP service was 1.6% (2/125) before
the educational intervention and 10.7% (21/197) afterwards (OR = 7.26, 95% CI = 1.7265.12, p = 0.0015). Diagnostic yield for patients on the inpatient service was 4.3% (1/23),
lower than previously reported. However, 34.8% (8/23) of patients had variants of
unknown significance (VUSs). 39.1% (9/23) of children who received genetic testing
while inpatients were underrepresented minorities, compared to 7.7% (1/13) of patients
who received genetic testing on other clinical services (OR = 7.35, CI = 0.81-365.00, p =
0.057). 43.5% of patients were lost to outpatient genetics follow-up.
Conclusion: Medical genetics education for fellows on an inpatient CAP service can
improve genetic testing rates. Genetic testing for inpatients may primarily identify VUSs
instead of well-known NDD risk variants. Genetic testing on the inpatient CAP service
may improve access to genetic services for underrepresented minorities, but assuring
outpatient follow-up can be challenging.

Introduction
Neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs; referring to Intellectual Disability (ID), Autism
Spectrum Disorder (ASD), and Global Developmental Delay (GDD) from here on) are
genetically complex and heterogeneous1,2. Deletions or duplications of genomic regions >5
million base pairs (Mb) (e.g. copy number variants (CNVs)) that disrupt important
neurobiological pathways are more common in individuals with NDDs than in the general
population3. Similarly, gene-disrupting single base-pair changes called Single Nucleotide
Variants (SNVs) are also more common in individuals with NDDs3. CNVs and SNVs that
are associated with NDDs tend to be individually rare (<1% of the general population), de
novo (e.g. not inherited from parents), and highly disruptive to key neurobiological
pathways4. There are also so-called “syndromic” forms of NDDs that are associated with
characteristic clinical features (e.g. specific dysmorphology or medical comorbidities) and
are caused entirely by disruption of one gene4. For example, Fragile X (FX) syndrome is
caused by disruption to the FMR1 gene by a CGG trinucleotide repeat expansion of >200
copies.

Diagnostic genetic testing for patients with NDDs, using chromosomal microarrays
(CMAs) to detect CNVs and polymerase chain reaction to detect FX syndrome, is now
recommended by many professional medical organizations including the American
College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and the American Academy of Child
and Adolescent Psychiatry (AACAP)5,6. Diagnostic yield (e.g. the percent of patients with
a positive genetic finding out of those who received genetic testing) using CMA is reported

as 15-20%7. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) to detect SNVs is often used as a secondline diagnostic test, but new guidelines are emerging suggesting its use as a first-tier test
because of diagnostic yields of 30-50%7. There are many potential benefits to genetic
testing and diagnosis, including improved reproductive counseling, enhanced community
support from other affected families, improved prognostic information and appropriate
medical monitoring, and the opportunity to participate in clinical research studies and
trials8,9. There are also rare instances when a genetic diagnosis can have direct treatment
implications10–12. The benefits of a genetic diagnosis will also grow as our knowledge about
individual conditions expands. Despite these recommendations and potential benefits,
genetic testing is often not offered to patients with NDDs by their physicians, including
child and adolescent psychiatrists. The reason for this is multifactorial, but is likely due to
a combination of insufficient training in genetics during residency and fellowship, limited
awareness of the recommendations, limited awareness of potential benefits of genetic
testing, limited time and a prioritization of other aspects of psychiatric care, barriers
presented by insurance companies, and financial constraints 13.

The inpatient child and adolescent psychiatry (CAP) service is in many ways an ideal
setting to provide genetic testing for patients with NDDs. Many patients with NDDs who
are admitted to an inpatient psychiatric service have a multitude of psychiatric and medical
comorbidities and lie at the severe end of the behavioral and functional impairment
spectrum. A relatively high burden of pathogenic CNVs and SNVs have been observed in
patients with NDDs and psychiatric comorbidities14–16, although the exact genetic

architecture of these patients’ conditions in comparison to those without psychiatric
comorbidities is not well-delineated.

Diagnostic genetic testing can also be integrated into the diagnostic work-up of patients on
the inpatient service6. Therefore, in order to provide a much needed and underutilized
diagnostic service that may improve outcomes for patients with NDDs, we attempted to
implement systematic diagnostic genetic testing for patients with NDDs on our inpatient
CAP service by educating CAP fellows in medical genetics. We then performed a
retrospective analysis of the 12 months before our intervention with the 19 months after
our intervention. Specifically, we analyzed genetic testing rates for patients with NDDs,
diagnostic yield, and rates of outpatient follow-up compared to the 12-month period prior.
We then compared our findings to previously published studies that reported diagnostic
yield in patients with NDDs and comorbid psychiatric disorders 14–16.

Methods
Education Initiative
There are two inpatient CAP teams headed by separate attending physicians at our
institution, the Resnick Neuropsychiatric Hospital at the University of California Los
Angeles. One is run by first-year CAP fellows who rotate onto the service for an average
of 4 months. The other is run by adult psychiatry residents completing their CAP training
for an average of three weeks. Due to the high turnover rate of adult residents, the attending
physician of this team (M.J.E.) played a primary role identifying patients with NDDs
eligible for genetic testing. The formal education intervention was provided to the CAP

fellows by A.D.B. It consisted of two parts: 1) All first-year CAP fellows were provided
with an hour-long didactic session about the genetic architecture of NDDs and the rationale
for genetic testing in patients with NDDs at the beginning of their academic year and 2)This
was followed by a second, informal, didactic session during orientation for their inpatient
CAP rotation, where they were refreshed on the benefits of genetic testing and introduced
to the specific genetic testing protocol (available upon request) that we developed for the
inpatient CAP service.

Study Design and Protocol
Throughout the entire implementation process, the genetic psychiatry service (A.D.B)
served as a consultant to the inpatient service for all questions regarding genetic testing
and was available to assist with all parts of the testing process, from identification and
evaluation of eligible patients to post-discharge follow-up. The genetic psychiatry service
is a pilot clinical service at our institution with the goal of increasing the availability of
genetics services to a wider range of psychiatry patients. We created a list of absolute and
relative indications for genetic testing. Absolute indications were ID, GDD, ASD and
childhood-onset schizophrenia (COS). Relative indications included epilepsy, severe
psychopathology with congenital malformations, and high family loading of severe
psychopathology suggesting possible mendelian inheritance. For the first 12 months after
the education intervention, only FX testing and Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP)
CMA (patient/proband only) were recommended for all patients. From 12 months to 19
months post-intervention, we offered reflex trio (patient and both parents) WES when
CMA and FX were negative or detected a variant of unknown significance (VUS) based

on evidence of improved diagnostic yield7. Signed informed consent for CMA and WES
was obtained from parents or guardians. Risks associated with genetic testing were
discussed with families, including the risk of finding unrelated but actionable genetic
variants per ACMG guidelines17, misattributed parentage, consanguinity, and potential
impact on life and disability insurance eligibility. The limitations of genetic testing were
also discussed. Orders for the genetic testing were placed by the fellow or resident who
were assigned to the patient. Blood was drawn from the patients by UCLA Medical Center
inpatient phlebotomists. Parents had their blood drawn at a UCLA-affiliated outpatient
phlebotomy laboratory. Genetic analysis and interpretation were completed by the CLIAcertified UCLA Molecular Diagnostics Laboratory, as previously reported for WES18, with
the addition of using the Genome Aggregation Database for variant analysis19. SNP CMA
Diagnostic criteria at UCLA is the following: A CNV is reported when at least 25 adjacent
oligonucleotide probes within a 50-200 kb segment or at least 50 adjacent oligonucleotide
probes within a ≥200 Kb segment show a copy number change. The interpretation follows
the ACMG guidelines20 for pathogenic variants, VUS (likely pathogenic), and VUS (no
subclassification). VUS (likely benign) and benign variants are not reported. The SNP
component of this microarray is designed to screen for regions of homozygosity (ROH) >
5 Mb. ROH can be indicative of uniparental disomy if within a chromosome, or an
increased risk of a recessive disorder if identified across multiple chromosomes. WES
results were discussed at UCLA Genomics Boards with A.D.B. and J.A.M.A. in attendance.
SNV classification is determined by the Genomics Board based off of guidelines set by the
ACMG and the Association for Molecular Pathology21. Outpatient follow-up appointments
with medical genetics, genetic psychiatry, or genetic counseling were scheduled for each

patient depending on specific patient factors. When genetic test results were finalized prior
to patient discharge, they were returned to the family by the patient’s fellow or resident in
consultation with either genetic psychiatry or a genetic counselor.

Data Extraction and Chart Review
We obtained UCLA Institutional Review Board approval for chart review and data
extraction on November 20, 2018 (IRB#16-001945). With the assistance of the UCLA
Clinical Translational Sciences Institute Informatics Program, we extracted demographic
information, medical, family and psychiatric history, medical and psychiatric diagnoses,
genetic test results, and outpatient medical genetics encounters for patients admitted to
our inpatient child and adolescent psychiatry service from July 1, 2016 – January 1, 2019
who carried the following diagnoses with the associated ICD-10 codes: Autism Spectrum
Disorder (F84.0, F84.1, F84.2, F84.3, F84.4, F84.5, F84.8, F84.9), Intellectual Disability
(F70, F71, F72, F73, F78, F79), Unspecified disorder of psychological development
(F89), Childhood onset schizophrenia (F20) and/or GDD (F88). Information was
extracted from the UCLA CareConnect (EPIC) Electronic Health Record (EHR) System
using the Integrated Clinical and Research Data Repository (xDR). xDR is a clinical data
warehouse system containing data from the UCLA EHR linked with older legacy systems
and other sources. The requested data was extracted with xDR using SQL and output into
encrypted comma-separated values files. All data was manually reviewed and curated by
A.D.B. and J.S.

Data Analysis
Fisher’s exact test was used to compare rates of genetic testing in the pre-intervention 12
month period to rates of genetic testing in the post-intervention 19 month period. Fisher’s
exact test was also used to compare rates of underrepresented minorities in those patients
who received genetic testing while on the inpatient unit to those patients who received
genetic testing from other clinical services. Fisher’s exact test was used instead of the
chi-squared test because there were less than 5 individuals in the samples22. All analyses
were performed using R Studio (RStudio: Integrated development environment for R,
Version 1.2.1335, Boston, MA).

Results
Rates of Genetic Testing and Diagnostic Yield
A total of 125 patients with eligible diagnoses were admitted to the inpatient service in the
pre-intervention year. Of those patients, only two (1.6%) received genetic testing while on
the inpatient service. One had both a pathogenic or likely pathogenic (P/LP) variant and a
VUS, while the other had no findings (Table 1, Table S1, available online). A total of 197
patients with eligible diagnoses were admitted to the inpatient service in the postintervention 19-month period. Twenty-one patients (10.7%) received genetic testing. The
increase in genetic testing rate between the pre- and post-intervention years was
statistically significant (OR = 7.26, 95% CI = 1.72-65.12, p = 0.0015). In the combined 31
months that included the pre- and post-intervention periods, 23 patients received genetic
testing while on the inpatient service with a diagnostic yield for P/LP variants of 4.3%
(Tables 1, S1, S2). 34.8% of tested patients had at least one VUS. Inheritance status of

VUSs found on CMA are unknown because parental testing was not completed. We
additionally assessed the number of eligible patients who were admitted to the inpatient
unit who had received genetic testing in clinical settings at UCLA (e.g. outpatient
neurology or medical genetics clinics) outside of their admission. 13 out of 322 patients
(4.0%) with an eligible diagnosis who had been admitted to the inpatient service received
genetic testing in clinical settings outside of the inpatient service (Table 2). Testing
approaches in these settings were inconsistent, not always in accordance with current
recommendations (e.g. did not provide FX and CMA testing to all patients), or was targeted
based on clinical presentation (e.g. PTEN sequencing for patients with ASD and
macrocephaly). Klinefelter’s syndrome was identified in one patient and VUSs were found
in two patients. We assessed demographic distribution between the patients who received
testing while inpatient compared to those who received testing from another clinical service.
Only 7.7% of patients tested on other clinical services were from underrepresented
minorities, while 39.1% of patients tested while on the inpatient service were
underrepresented minorities (OR = 7.35, CI = 0.81-365.00, p = 0.057)

Demographics and Clinical Outcomes
Eighteen out of 23 patients (78.3%) who received genetic testing on the inpatient service
were male and 14/23 (60.9%) were non-Hispanic Caucasian (age range 6-17 years old).
For the patients who received genetic testing from other clinical services, 11/13 (84.6%)
were male and 12/13 (92.3%) were non-Hispanic Caucasian (age range 7-17 years old).
Ethnicity was determined based on report in EHR. Most patients had multiple medical and
psychiatric comorbidities (Table 1, Figure 1), were on multiple psychotropic medications

(Table S3, available online), and had a significant family history of psychiatric illness
(Table S4, available online). Attempts were made to coordinate outpatient genetics followup for all patients who received genetic testing, but 10/23 patients (43.5%) were still lost
to outpatient follow-up (Figure 2). There were no instances where genetic testing altered
medical management of the patients while on the inpatient service, but one patient was
referred to a research study for whole genome sequencing.

Discussion
Genetic Test Results and Diagnostic Yield
When we designed the initial genetic testing protocol, we decided to expand eligibility
criteria beyond current guidelines (e.g. ID, ASD, GDD) to include COS, complex
psychiatric presentation and a family history enriched for psychiatric disorders. COS is a
rare and severe NDD with a reported enrichment of known NDD-associated pathogenic
CNVs compared to both matched, related controls and patients with adult-onset
schizophrenia23, as well as disease-associated SNVs24–26. We were careful to include only
those patients who had a well-documented history of psychosis-onset prior to the beginning
of puberty. In one patient with COS, we identified a heterozygous missense VUS in
SHANK2 (Tables 1, Table S2, available online), which codes for a post-synaptic density
protein highly expressed in glutamatergic synapses27. SHANK2 missense variants have
been linked to schizophrenia in case-control and family studies27,28, but was not identified
as a schizophrenia risk gene in a recent, large trio WES study29. The father was unavailable
for testing, so we were unable to conclude if it was de novo or paternally inherited, making

it more difficult to conclude pathogenicity. Future reanalysis of these results (when more
is known about the association of SHANK2 to psychopathology) will likely be informative.

We also included patients who had a common psychiatric presentation without an NDD
but with atypical comorbid features suggestive of a specific genetic syndrome. For example,
one patient presented with adolescent-onset psychosis, depression and anxiety as well as a
strikingly marfanoid habitus and dysmorphic facial features, suggestive of the 3q27.3
microdeletion syndrome30. However, the patient did not carry this deletion nor a pathogenic,
exonic SNV in any genes within the region. We referred the patient to a whole genome
sequencing study to try to identify a novel pathogenic variant. While we did not have any
positive findings in the small number of patients included under these additional criteria, it
is especially important that psychiatrists recognize the potential benefit of genetic testing
in these populations because they are often the patient’s primary physician. In contrast, for
patients with ASD, ID, or GDD, other specialists (e.g. medical geneticists) are commonly
involved in clinical management.

The overall diagnostic yield for the 23 patients identified through our inpatient genetic
testing protocol was 4.3%, based on a likely pathogenic deletion in 12p12.1 (LambShaffer Syndrome; MIM 604975) in patient 1 (Table 1). It is unknown if this variant is
de novo as parents were unavailable for testing. To our knowledge, this is the first report
of a patient with Lamb-Shaffer Syndrome with situs inversus, Tourette’s Syndrome,
ADHD and OCD, although given the presence of an additional VUS that the patient
carried, it is difficult to fully attribute the full phenotype to the 12p12.1 deletion 31. No

P/LP variants were identified through WES or FX testing (Table 1). The low yield on FX
testing is consistent with other recent studies in NDDs and supports the argument that FX
testing may not be an appropriate first-tier test for all patients with NDDs 32, including on
the inpatient service. By comparison, Viñas-Jones et al. successfully diagnosed FX
Syndrome in five patients with NDDs and psychiatric co-morbidities by only testing
those patients with clinical features consistent with FX Syndrome15 (Table 3), which may
be a superior approach32.

The diagnostic yield of 4.3% for patients who received genetic testing while on inpatient
was lower than we expected. We hypothesized a diagnostic yield of between 15%-20%
based on previous studies in NDD populations7. Our low yield may be an artifact of low
sample size, but there are other factors to consider. First, our patient population is
considerably enriched for severe comorbid psychiatric disorders, especially intermittent
explosive disorder (IED) and ADHD (Figure 1), and therefore may have a different
genetic architecture to the general NDD population. However, previous studies of adults
with ID and comorbid psychiatric disorders14–16 (Table 3) report a P/LP diagnostic yield
of 24-34.6% (Table 3)14–16. There are meaningful differences between these studies and
ours that likely explains some of the difference in yield. Based on the pathogenicity
classification methods used (Table 3), two studies likely classified some variants as LP
that we classified as VUS14,15. This is reflected in our high overall yield of VUSs of
34.8% (Table 1, Tables S1, S2, available online). In fact, we had two patients with the
same VUS (15q11.2 duplication, breakpoints 1-2) (Table 1, Table S1, available online).
Currently, its pathogenicity is unclear because of a lack of a clear association with a

specific NDD phenotype33. However, as more patients with NDDs and psychiatric
comorbidities are included in large-scale genetic studies and more affected patients with
these rare variants are identified, more variants may reach the threshold for pathogenicity
and the diagnostic yields between studies may start to align.

Other important difference from previous studies are the demographics and the
prevalence of specific psychiatric disorders in each cohort. The previous studies had a
larger percentage of patients with ID (39.1% current study vs. 60-100%14–16), which is a
population that may be enriched for rare, pathogenic variants compared to those with
ASD or GDD. The other studies also did not report the ethnic or racial breakdown of
their cohorts. We had a relatively high percentage of underrepresented minorities 9/23
(39.1%) who are not well represented in most NDD genetics studies. Therefore, it is
possible that these patients have less well-established disease-associated variants.
Furthermore, the previous studies were in adult populations whose psychiatric and
behavioral problems are somewhat different to those seen in our young population. For
example, they identified a relatively high rate of genetic syndromes known to be
associated with psychosis, such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and 16p11.2 duplication
syndrome (Table 3)14–16. In contrast, our patients most commonly presented to the
hospital due to aggressive behavior related to impulse control disorders such as ADHD
and IED (Figure 1). Lastly, we reviewed the charts of all eligible patients to verify that
our low yield was not due to the exclusion of patients with a pre-existing genetic
diagnosis. We only identified a single patient with a pre-existing diagnosis of Klinefelter
Syndrome, suggesting that this was not a major confounder. It is unclear why so few

patients with genetic syndromes commonly associated with NDDs and severe behavioral
problems, such as Prader-Willi Syndrome, were not hospitalized at our institution during
the 31-month study period.

Lastly, inherited common variants (e.g. single nucleotide polymorphisms that are passed
down from parents to child) also contribute to the genetic liability of NDDs34–36, although
to less of a degree than in common psychiatric disorders such as OCD37,38,
schizophrenia39, and depression40. It may be that patients with NDDs and severe
psychiatric comorbidities have a genetic liability architecture more similar to common
psychiatric disorders and therefore a lower burden of rare, de novo, pathogenic variants
that we would have detected with our diagnostic approach. The high burden of mental
illness in our patient’s families (Table S4, available online) supports this possibility.

Impact on Clinical Care
One unexpected finding was that 9/23 (39.1%) of the patients tested on the inpatient service
over the entire 31-month study were underrepresented minorities (Table 1), compared to
1/13 (7.7%) of those tested in other clinical settings (Table 2), with a trend towards
significance (p = 0.057) limited by our sample size and power. This suggests that genetic
testing on the inpatient CAP service may help improve access to genetic services for
underrepresented minorities with NDDs41–43. We think this may be the case because once
a child is hospitalized, several barriers to care, including insurance authorization and
language and financial hurdles limiting specialty referrals, are reduced.

There were no instances where the genetic test results had a direct effect on medical
management, although this has been demonstrated elsewhere10–12,44. The low diagnostic
yield and high VUS rate limited the likelihood of the genetic testing having a direct effect
on management. However, as more VUSs become reclassified as pathogenic and each
disorder becomes better characterized, the chance of improving clinical care will increase.
Our patient with psychosis, a unique facial gestalt, and a marfanoid habitus consistent with
3q27.2 deletion syndrome but without any pathogenic variants in that region was referred
to a research study with the hopes of identifying a novel gene or genomic region associated
with her unique phenotype. If it is successful, it may have implications for that patient and
others in the future.

Trainee Education and Genetic Testing Implementation
A major hurdle to the implementation of genetic testing in the inpatient CAP setting is the
lack of training that many psychiatrists and psychiatry trainees have in medical genetics13.
CAP fellow education and attending physician-driven consultation to genetic psychiatry
service resulted in a significant increase in testing rate, from 1.6% to 10.7% of eligible
patients (p = 0.0015), primarily driven by an increase in CAP fellow testing, as they tested
fourteen out of the 21 patients in the post-intervention period. This jump in testing rates is
consistent with our experience educating the CAP fellows on medical genetics while on
their inpatient rotation. They were extremely receptive to learning about genetic testing
and after every didactic session, several would approach our team with questions about
how to proceed with testing for current patients of theirs. They were very proactive in
reaching out to our team for additional advice on new, eligible patients. Most CAP fellows

preferred that our team lead the consent process, but they were always in attendance. This
level of engagement was significantly greater compared to our prior experiences giving
lectures as part of standard didactic training only.

Limitations and Future Directions
A major limitation to our study was the small number of tested patients, which reduces the
generalizability of our findings. Ongoing, large-scale efforts such as those by the Autism
Inpatient Collection will be essential to improve our understanding of the genetic
architecture of NDDs with comorbid psychiatric disorders45,46. With this additional
information, annual reanalysis of the genetic test results will improve diagnostic yield, as
has been demonstrated in other studies of NDDs47. We were also limited by our lack of
access to all health records outside of UCLA, thus we may have underestimated the rate of
outpatient genetic testing for our patients. We attempted to address this question by
searching all EHR diagnostic codes for specific genetic syndromes to capture all genetic
diagnoses that were manually input by clinicians. We only identified a single patient with
a known genetic syndrome (XXY, Klinefelter Syndrome) that had been diagnosed outside
of our institution prior to admission. This suggests that we likely identified almost all
patients with a known genetic syndrome and if patients received genetic testing elsewhere,
it had likely come back negative or with VUSs that were not reported by families or not
entered into the EHR by clinicians, consistent with our other findings.

Another challenge we encountered was to provide proper outpatient genetics follow-up.
Outpatient follow-up is especially important for inpatient genetic testing because the

majority of the time the test results come back after the patient is discharged. Explicit
directions were provided in our protocol for arranging outpatient follow-up and social
workers on the inpatient teams were available to assist with this process. Despite these
efforts, over 40% of our patients were lost to follow-up (Figure 2), although we can’t be
certain that families didn’t find genetics follow-up on their own. There were likely many
contributing factors, but the primary ones we identified were challenges with insurance
authorization for follow-up appointments (especially with health maintenance
organizations), psychiatry trainees’ lack of familiarity with outpatient genetics services,
and confusion about responsibility for follow-up. Our loss to follow-up rate may even
underestimate what others might experience because two of us provide outpatient genetics
follow-up services, as a medical geneticist (J.A.M.A.) and genetic psychiatrist (A.D.B.).
One way to address this challenge in the future may be to provide more rapid genetic testing
on the inpatient service, as it has been successfully implemented in intensive care settings48.
If the genetic test results were available within several days (instead of weeks), they could
be returned to the family prior to discharge, and potentially impact inpatient management10–
