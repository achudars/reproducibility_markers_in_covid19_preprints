Abstract

68

INTRODUCTION: The presymptomatic phase of neurodegenerative disease can last many years, with

69

sustained cognitive function despite progressive atrophy. We investigate this phenomenon in familial

70

Frontotemporal dementia (FTD).

71

METHODS: We studied 121 presymptomatic FTD mutation carriers and 134 family members without

72

mutations, using multivariate data-driven approach to link cognitive performance with both structural and

73

functional magnetic resonance imaging. Atrophy and brain network connectivity were compared between

74

groups, in relation to the time from expected symptom onset.

75

RESULTS: There were group differences in brain structure and function, in the absence of differences in

76

cognitive performance. Specifically, we identified behaviourally-relevant structural and functional network

77

differences. Structure-function relationships were similar in both groups, but coupling between functional

78

connectivity and cognition was stronger for carriers than for non-carriers, and increased with proximity to

79

the expected onset of disease.

80

DISCUSSION: Our findings suggest that maintenance of functional network connectivity enables carriers to

81

maintain cognitive performance.

1. Introduction

84

Across the adult healthy lifespan, the structural and functional properties of brain networks are coupled,

85

and both are predictive of cognitive ability [1,2]. The connections between structure, function and

86

performance have been influential in developing current models of ageing and neurodegeneration [3–5].

87

However, this work contrasts with the emerging evidence of neuropathological and structural changes

88

many years before the onset of symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) [6–

89

8]. Genetic FTD with highly-penetrant gene mutations provides the opportunity to examine the precursors

90

of symptomatic disease. Three main genes account for 10-20% of FTD cases: chromosome 9 open reading

91

frame 72 (C9orf72), granulin (GRN) and microtubule-associated protein tau (MAPT). These genes vary in

92

their phenotypic expression and in the age of onset [9]. Despite pleiotropy [10], environmental and

93

secondary genetic moderation [11,12] all three mutations cause significant structural brain changes in key

94

regions over a decade before the expected age of disease onset [7,13], confirmed by longitudinal studies

95

[14,15].

96

The divergence between early structural change and late cognitive decline begs the question: how do

97

presymptomatic gene carriers stay so well in the face of progressive atrophy? We propose that the answer

98

lies in the maintenance of network dynamics and functional organisation [16]. Across the lifespan,

99

functional brain network connectivity predicts cognitive status [17], and this connectivity-cognition

100

relationship becomes stronger with age [18,19].

101

Our overarching hypothesis is that for those at genetic risk of dementia, the maintenance of network

102

connectivity prevents the manifestation of symptoms despite progressive structural changes. A challenge

103

is that neither the anatomical and functional substrates of cognition nor the targets of neurodegenerative

104

disease are mediated by single brain regions: they are distributed across multi-level and interactive

105

networks. We therefore used a multivariate data-driven approach to identify differences in the

106

multidimensional brain-behaviour relationship between presymptomatic carriers and non-carriers of

107

mutations in FTD genes. We identified key brain networks [20] from a large independent population-based

108

age-matched dataset [21].

109

We tested three key hypotheses: (i) presymptomatic carriers differ from non-carriers in brain structure and

110

brain function, but not in cognitive function, (ii) brain structure and function correlate with performance in

111

both groups, but functional network indices are stronger predictors of cognition in carriers, and (iii) the

112

dependence on network integrity for maintaining cognitive functioning increases as carriers approach the

113

onset of symptoms.

114

2. Methods

115

2.1. Participants

116

Thirteen research sites across Europe and Canada recruited participants as part of an international

117

multicentre partnership, the Genetic Frontotemporal Initiative (GENFI). 313 participants had usable

118

structural and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data (MRI) [7,13]. The study was

119

approved by the institutional review boards for each site, and participants providing written informed

120

consent. Five participants were excluded due to excessive head motion (see below), resulting in 308

121

datasets for further analysis.

122

Participants were genotyped based on whether they carried a pathogenic mutation in MAPT, GRN and

123

C9orf72. In this study, we focus on non-carriers (NC, N=134) and presymptomatic carriers (PSC, N=121), i.e.

124

gene carriers with normal cognitive function based on a neurocognitive assessment (see below).

125

Participants and site investigators were blinded to the research genotyping, although a minority of

126

participants had undergone predictive testing outwith the GENFI study. See Table 1 for demographic

127

information of both groups. In keeping with other GENFI reports, the years to expected onset (EYO) were

128

calculated as the difference between age at assessment and mean age at onset within the family [7].

129
130

2.2. Neurocognitive assessment

131

Each participant completed a standard clinical assessment consisting of medical history, family history,

132

functional status and physical examination, in complement with collateral history from a family member or

133

a close friend. In the current study 13 behavioural measures of cognitive function were correlated with

134

neuroimaging measures. These included the Uniform Data Set [22]: the Logical Memory subtest of the

135

Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised with Immediate and Delayed Recall scores, Digit Span forwards and

136

backwards from the Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised, a Digit Symbol Task, Parts A and B of the Trail Making

137

Test, the short version of the Boston Naming Test, and Category Fluency (animals). Additional tests included

138

three subscores of the Letter Fluency and Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence Block Design task,

139

and the Mini-Mental State Examination. Latency measures for the Trail Making Test were inverted so that

140

higher values across all tests reflect better performance.

2.3. Neuroimaging assessment

143

Figure 1 provides a schematic representation of imaging data processing pipeline and the analysis strategy

144

for linking brain-behaviour data. MRI data were acquired using 3T scanners and 1.5T where no 3T scanning

145

was available from various vendors, with optimised scanning protocols to maximise synchronisation across

146

scanners and sites [7,13]. A 3D-structural MRI was acquired on each participant using T1-weighted

147

Magnetic Prepared Rapid Gradient Echo sequence. The co-registered T1 images were segmented to extract

148

probabilistic maps of 6 tissue classes: grey matter (GM), white matter (WM), cerebrospinal fluid (CSF),

149

bone, soft tissue, and residual noise. The native-space GM and WM images were submitted to

150

diffeomorphic registration to create equally represented gene-group template images [DARTEL; 23]. The

151

templates for all tissue types were normalised to the Montreal Neurological Institute template using a 12-

152

parameter affine transformation. The normalised images were smoothed using an 8-mm Gaussian kernel.

153

For resting state fMRI measurements, Echo-Planar Imaging data were acquired with at least six minutes of

154

scanning. The imaging data were analysed using Automatic Analysis [AA 4.0; ,24] pipelines and modules

155

which called relevant functions from SPM12 [25]. To quantify the total motion for each participant, the root

156

mean square volume-to-volume displacement was computed using the approach of Jenkinson et al [26].

157

Participants with 3.5 or more standard deviations above the group mean motion displacement were

158

excluded from further analysis (N = 5). To further ensure that potential group bias in head motion did not

159

affect later analysis of connectivity, we took three further steps: i) fMRI data was further postprocessed

160

using whole-brain Independent Component Analysis (ICA) of single subject time-series denoising, with

161

noise components selected and removed automatically using a priori heuristics using the ICA-based

162

algorithm [27], ii) postprocessing of network node time-series (see below) and iii) a subject-specific

163

estimate of head movement for each participant [26] included as a covariate in group-level analysis [28].

164

2.4. Network definition

165

The location of the key cortical regions in each network was identified by spatial-ICA in an independent

166

dataset of 298 age-matched healthy individuals from a large population-based cohort [21]. Full details

167

about preprocessing and node definition are described previously [29]. Four networks commonly affected

168

by neurodegenerative diseases including FTD [20] were identified by spatially matching to pre-existing

169

templates [30]. The node time-series were defined as the first principal component resulting from the

170

singular value decomposition of voxels in an 8-mm radius sphere, which was centred on the peak voxel for

171

each node [18]. Visual representation of the spatial distribution of the nodes is shown in Figure 2.

172

We aimed to further reduce the effects of noise confounds on functional connectivity effects of node time-

173

series using general linear model (GLM) [28]. This model included linear trends, expansions of realignment

174

parameters, as well as average signal in WM and CSF, including their derivative and quadratic regressors

175

from the time-courses of each node. The WM and CSF signals were created by using the average signal

176

across all voxels with corresponding tissue probability larger than 0.7 in associated tissue probability maps

177

available in SPM12. A band-pass filter (0.0078-0.1 Hz) was implemented by including a discrete cosine

178

transform set in the GLM. Finally, the functional connectivity (FC) between each pair of nodes was

179

computed using Pearson’s correlation on postprocessed time-series.

180
181
182

2.5. Statistical analysis
2.5.1. Group differences in brain structure, function and cognition

183

To assess the group-differences in neuroimaging and behavioural dataset we used multiple linear

184

regression with a well-conditioned shrinkage regularization [31,32] and 10-Fold Cross–Validation [33]. In

185

the analysis of brain structure we used as independent variables the mean grey matter volume (GMV) of

186

246 brain nodes [34]. In the analysis of brain function, we used the functional connectivity between 15

187

nodes, which were part of the four large-scale functional networks described above. In the analysis of

188

cognitive function, the independent variables comprised the performance measures on the 13

189

neuropsychological tests performed outside of the scanner. In all three analyses the dependent variable

190

was the genetic status (PSC vs NC) including age as a covariate of no interest. In addition, in the analysis of

191

neuroimaging data we included scanner site and head motion as additional covariates of no interest.

192

2.5.2. Brain-behaviour relationships

193

For the brain-behaviour analysis, we adopted a two-level procedure. In the first-level analysis, we assessed

194

the multidimensional brain-behaviour relationships using partial least squares [35]. This analysis described

195

the linear relationships between the two multivariate datasets, namely neuroimaging (either GMV or FC)

196

and behavioural performance, by providing pairs of latent variables (Brain-LVs and Cognition-LVs) as linear

197

combinations of the original variables which are optimised to maximise their covariance. Namely, dataset

198

1 consisted of a brain feature set, which could be either grey matter volume (GMV dataset) or functional

199

connectivity strength between pairs of regions for each individual (FC dataset). Dataset 2 included the

200

performance measures on the 13 tests (i.e. Cognition dataset), as considered in the multiple linear

201

regression analysis of group differences in cognition. Covariates of no interest included head motion,

202

scanner site, gender and handedness.

203

Next, we tested whether the identified behaviourally-relevant LVs of brain structure and function were

204

differentially expressed by NC and PSC as a function of expected years to onset. To this end, we performed

205

a second-level analysis using multiple linear regression with robust fitting algorithm as implemented in

206

matlab’s function “fitlm.m”. Independent variables included subjects’ brain scores from first level PLS

207

(either Structure-LV or Function-LV subject scores), group information, expected years to onset and their

208

interaction terms (e.g. brain scores x group, brain scores x years to expected onset, etc.). The dependent

209

variable was subjects’ cognitive scores from the first level analysis in the corresponding PLS (Cognition-LV).

210

Covariates of no interest included gender, handedness, head movement and education (Figure 1).

213

3.1. Group differences in neuroimaging and cognitive data
Brain structure

214

The multiple linear regression model testing for overall group differences in grey matter volume between

215

PSC and NC was significant (r=.14, p=.025), reflecting expected presymptomatic differences in brain-wide

216

atrophy. The frontal, parietal and subcortical regions had most atrophy in PSC (Figure 3). As expected, the

217

group difference in grey matter volume of these regions increased as EYO decreased, see Supplementary

218

Materials.

219

Brain Function

220

The multiple linear regression model testing for overall group differences in functional connectivity

221

between PSC and NC was marginally significant (r=.12, p=.049). The pattern of connectivity indicated mainly

222

increased connectivity between SN-DMN and SN-FPN in presymptomatic carriers, coupled with decreased

223

connectivity within the networks and DMN-FPN connectivity (Figure 3).

224

Cognitive Function

225

We did not identify group differences in cognition and behaviour (r=.002, p=.807), confirming the

226

impression of “healthy” status among presymptomatic carriers. However, in the next section, we consider

227

the relationships between structure, function and cognition that underlie this maintenance of cognitive

228

function.

229
230

3.2. Brain-behaviour relationships
Structure-cognition

231

Partial least squares analysis of grey matter volume and cognition identified one significant pair of latent

232

variables (r = .40, p = .009). This volumetric latent variable expressed negative loadings in frontal (superior

233

frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, paracentral lobule), parietal (postcentral gyrus, precuneus, superior and

234

inferior parietal lobule) and occipital (lateral and medial occipital cortex) regions and positive loadings in

235

parahippocampal and hippocampal regions (Figure 4). The Cognition-LV profile expressed positively a large

236

array of cognitive tests, with strongest values on delayed memory, Trail Making, Digit Symbol, Boston

237

Naming and Fluency tests. The positive correlation between volumetric and cognitive LV’s confirms the

238

expected relationship across the cohort as a whole, between cortical grey matter volume and both

239

executive, language and mnemonic function (Figure 4).

240

To understand the structure-cognition relationship in each group and in relation to the expected

241

years of onset, we performed a second-level moderation analysis using a regression model: we entered

242

Cognition-LV subject scores as dependent variable, and grey matter volume LV subject scores, genetic

243

status (i.e. carrier or non-carrier), expected years to onset and their interactions as independent variables

244

in addition to covariates of no interest. The results indicated that the relationship between grey matter

245

volume and cognition could not be explained by genetic status, expected years to onset or their interactions

246

with grey matter volume LV subject scores. There was no evidence for genetic status- and onset-dependent

247

differences (over and above ageing and other covariates) in the associations between grey matter volume

248

and cognition in this analysis (Figure 4).

249

Connectivity-Cognition

250

PLS analysis of functional connectivity and cognition also identified one significant pair of LVs (Function-LV

251

and Cognition-LV, r=.32, p=.020), see Figure 5. This Function-LV reflected weak between-network

252

connectivity, coupled with strong within-network connectivity. This pattern indicates the segregation or

253

modularity of large-scale brain networks. The Cognition-LV expressed all tests, with positive loading values

254

indicating that higher performance on a wide range of cognitive tests is associated with stronger functional

255

network segregation. Cognitive deficits were associated with loss of segregation, with increased between-

256

network connectivity and decreased within-network connectivity.

257

To further test whether the observed behaviourally-relevant pattern of connectivity is differentially

258

expressed between genetic status groups and expected years of onset, we constructed a second-level

259

regression model with robust error estimates by including Function-LV subject scores, genetic status,

260

expected years of onset and their interaction terms as independent variables and Cognition-LV as

261

dependent variable in addition to covariates of no interest (Figure 5).

262

We found evidence for significant interaction between expected years of onset and Function-LV (r=.21,

263

p<.001) and between group and Function-LV (r=.15, p=.003) explaining unique variance in Cognition-LV.

264

We used the Dawson and Richter approach [36] to test formally for differences in the relationship (i.e.

265

simple slopes) between Function-LV and Cognition-LV for PSC and NC. The relationship between Function-

266

LV and Cognition-LV was stronger for PSC relative to NC (r=.15, p=.003), indicating the increasing

267

importance of functional connectivity between the large-scale networks for PSC participants to maintain

268

performance (Figure 5).

269

For ease of interpretation and illustration, we also computed the correlation between Cognition-LV and

270

Function-LV for high and low levels of expected years to onset (EYO) within each group separately, where

271

the levels were taken to be 1 standard deviation above and below the mean values of EYO. The two EYO

272

subgroups were labelled “near” and “far”, with “near” for EYO values close to zero (i.e. participant’s age is

273

“near” the age at which disease symptoms were demonstrated in the family), and “far” for EYO being a

274

largely negative value (i.e. participant’s age is “far” from the age at which disease symptoms were

275

demonstrated in the family). The analysis indicated that as the EYO decreases (i.e. participant’s age is

276

reaching the years of onset of symptoms) the relationship between functional connectivity and

277

performance becomes stronger (moderation effects: r=.14, p=.021 and r=.28, p<.001 for NC and PSC,

278

respectively). Interestingly this relationship was stronger in each EYO subgroup for PSC relative to NC (PSC-

279

Near vs NC-Near: r=.28, p<.001; PSC-Far vs NC-Far: r=.22, p=.001). These findings indicate that the

280

relationship between FC and cognition is stronger in PSC relative to NC, and that this relationship increases

281

as a function of EYO.

4. Discussion

284

In the present study, we confirmed previous findings of group differences in brain structure and function,

285

in the absence of differences in cognitive performance between non-carriers and presymptomatic carriers

286

of FTD-related genetic mutations. But, while the relationship between structure and cognition was similar

287

in both groups, the coupling between function and cognition was stronger for presymptomatic carriers,

288

and increased as they approached the expected onset of disease.

289

These results suggest that people can maintain good cognitive abilities and successful day-to-day

290

functioning despite significant neuronal loss and atrophy. This disjunction between structure and function

291

is a feature of healthy ageing, but we have shown that it also characterises presymptomatic FTD, over and

292

above the age effects in their other family members, despite widespread progressive atrophy. The

293

multivariate approach reveals two key findings: (i) presymptomatic carriers express stronger between-

294

network and weaker within-network functional connectivity than age-matched non-carriers, and (ii) as

295

carriers approach their estimated age of symptom onset, and atrophy becomes evident, the maintenance

296

of good cognition is increasingly associated with sustaining balance of within- and between-network

297

integration.

298

This balance of within- and between-network connectivity is characteristic of segregated and specialized

299

network organization of brain systems. Such functional segregation varies with physiological ageing

300

[17,18,37], with cognitive function [18] and in individuals at risk for Alzheimer’s disease [38]. Graph-

301

theoretic quantification of network organisation confirms the relevance of modularity and efficiency to

302

function in FTD [16]. Conversely, the loss of neural systems’ modularity mirrors the loss of functional

303

specialization with age [39] and dementia [38]. Here, we show the significance of the maintenance of this

304

functional network organisation, with a progressively stronger correlation with cognitive performance as

305

seemingly healthy adults approach the age of expected onset of FTD.

306

The uncoupling of brain function from brain structure indicates that there may be independent and

307

synergistic effects of multiple factors leading to cognitive preservation. This is consistent with a previous

308

work in healthy ageing where brain activity and connectivity provide independent and synergistic

309

predictions of performance across the lifespan [19]. Therefore, future studies need to consider the

310

independent and synergistic effects of many possible biomarkers, based on MRI, computed tomography,

311

positron-emission tomography, CSF, blood and brain histopathology. For example, functional network

312

impairment may be related to tau expression and tau pathology, amyloid load, or neurotransmitter deficits

313

in neurodegenerative diseases, independent of atrophy [29,40–42]. Importantly, studies need to recognise

314

the rich multivariate nature of cognition and of neuroimaging in order to improve stratification procedures,

315

e.g. based on integrative approaches that explain individual differences in cognitive impairment [29,43].

316

We also recognise the difficulty to determine a unique contribution of each factor (e.g. brain structure and

317

brain function), given the increasing interaction between factors in advanced stages of disease [44]. This is

318

further complicated by these alterations becoming irreversible with progression of neurodegeneration

319

[45]. This suggests that the critical interplay between multiple factors (including brain structure and

320

function) may be better studied in the asymptomatic and preclinical stages as well as across the healthy

321

lifespan, which could still be modifiable and their influences are likely to be more separable.

322

Our findings agree with the model of compensation in the presymptomatic and early phases of

323

Huntington’s disease, where network coupling predicted better cognitive performance [46]. In a recent

324

longitudinal study a non-linear concave-down pattern of both brain activity and behaviour was present,

325

despite a linear decline in brain volume over time, [47]. Similar effects have been observed also in healthy

326

ageing and amnestic mild cognitive impairment, where greater connectivity with the default-mode network

327

and weaker connectivity between default-mode network and dorsal-attention network was associated with

328

higher cognitive status in both groups [48]. Network integrity may also play a role in compensatory

329

mechanisms in non-cognitive symptoms, such as motor impairment in Parkinson’s disease [49].

330

Accordingly, increased network efficiency and connectivity has been shown in prodromal phases, followed

331

by decreased local connectivity in symptomatic phases, suggesting the emergence and dissipation of neural

332

compensation [50].

333

The current study has several limitations. First, despite the large sample of subjects included, we did not

334

analyse each gene separately, as it may have resulted in too small and unbalanced samples, lowering

335

statistical power and robustness. Moreover, genetic FTD is also characterised by multiple mutations within

336

these genes and pleiotropy of clinical phenotypes even for the same mutation [10]. Pleiotropy in terms of

337

clinical phenotype is avoided by the study of presymptomatic carriers, but we cannot rule out pleiotropy

338

of intermediate phenotypes expressed as say neural network diversity. Furthermore, clinical heterogeneity

339

is modified by environmental factors such as education [which may be a surrogate of cognitive reserve, 51],

340

in FTD as in other dementias [12]. Genetic modifiers such as TMEM106B [52], APOE [53], have also been

341

identified. Further work, with larger cohorts, will be able to test the potential effect of these moderators

342

on the relationships between brain structure, functional networks and cognition. Future studies will benefit

343

from using brain measures that reflect differences in neural connectivity directly from neurophysiology or

344

separation of neurovascular from neuronal contributors to BOLD fMRI variance [18,54], which can

345

confound the effects of age, drug or disease [55].

346

The current study is cross-sectional. Therefore, we cannot infer longitudinal progression within subjects as

347

the unambiguous cause of the effects we observe in relation to expected years of onset. Accumulating

348

evidence suggests that network integrity serves to maintain performance with either physiological ageing

349

or pathological conditions. However, longitudinal mediation studies and pharmacological or electroceutical

350

interventions would be needed to prove its causal role in cognitive preservation. Finally, our findings are

351

limited to autosomal dominant FTD, which represents a minority of FTD: generalisation to sporadic forms

352

of disease would be speculative.

353

In conclusion, we used a multivariate data-driven approach to demonstrate that brain functional integrity

354

can enable presymptomatic carriers to maintain cognitive performance in the presence of progressive brain

355

atrophy for years before the onset of symptoms. The approach and the findings have implications for the

356

design of presymptomatic disease-modifying therapy trials and the study of unique and synergistic effects

357

of risk factors and biomarkers in health and disease, which are otherwise increasingly interacting and

358

irreversible with progression of neurodegeneration.

Figure 1. Schematic representation of data processing and analysis pipeline to test for
brain-behaviour differences between presymptomatic carriers (PSC) and non-carriers (NC) as a
function of expected years to onset (EYO) of symptoms, while controlling for covariates of no
interest (Covs). Brain structural measures were based on the mean grey matter volume (GMV) in
246 nodes, as defined in the Brainnetome atlas [34]. Brain functional measures were based on the
functional connectivity between 15 nodes as part of four large-scale networks, which were defined
in an independent cohort of 298 age-matched individuals part of the Cam-CAN dataset
(Passamonti et al 2019 BioArxiv).

Figure 2. Visualisation of spatial localisation of the nodes part of the four large-scale
networks and their mean functional connectivity (circular plot) across all participants in this study.
Nodes and networks were defined in an independent cohort of 298 age-matched individuals part
of the Cam-CAN dataset (Passamonti et al 2019).The default mode network (DMN) contained five
nodes: the ventral anterior cingulate cortex (vACC), dorsal and ventral posterior cingulate cortex
(vPCC and dPCC), and right and left inferior parietal lobes (rIPL and lIPL). The salience network
(SN) was defined using right and left anterior insular (rAI and lAI) and dorsal anterior cingulate
cortex (dACC). The frontoparietal network (FPN) was defined using right and left anterior superior
frontal gyrus (raSFG and laSFG), and right and left angular gyrus (rAG and lAG). The dorsal
attention Network (DAN) was defined using right and left intraparietal sulcus (rIPS and lIPS).
