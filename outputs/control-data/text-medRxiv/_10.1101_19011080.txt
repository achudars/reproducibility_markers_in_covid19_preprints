Abstract
Background
There are 4 courses of multiple sclerosis (MS): clinically-isolated syndrome (CIS), relapsingremitting MS (RRMS), primary-progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary-progressive MS
(SPMS). We aimed to achieve a further sophistication in the definition of MS phenotypes by
identifying patient subgroups who accumulate magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
abnormalities with similar patterns. We assessed whether data-driven subtyping predicted
clinical outcome and response to experimental treatments.
Methods
In this retrospective study, we included longitudinal data from 8,545 people with MS who had
31,451 visits from 14 double-blind randomised controlled trials and three observational
cohorts. We included cross-sectional data from 14,928 healthy volunteers. For each visit, we
processed brain MRI scans. We obtained 18 MRI variables, includ that included the volume
of the cortex of each lobe and deep grey matter, cerebellar grey matter and wite matter, total
lesion volume, cerebral white matter, brainstem, and T1/T2 ratio in regions of the normal
appearing white matter (or NAWM). We trained a machine learning algorithm, called SuStaIn,
on 14 datasets to identify data-driven subtypes. We then tested it in three external,
independent datasets.we assessed the external validity of our model by testing if we could
predict 24-week confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) progression, disease
activity, and the reduction in EDSS worsening in each subtype on treatment vs placebo. To
investigate whether there was a difference in the treatment response between the SuStaIn
subtypes we used linear mixed effect modles
Findings
We identified three data-driven subtypes with a distinct neuroanatomical spread of abnormality
and termed subtypes according to areas they affected early in disease course: cortex-first
(44% of patients), NAWM-first (30%), and the lesion-first (26%). Data-driven subtyping and
staging, but not clinical classifications or EDSS at baseline, was associated with time to EDSS
progression (ùõΩSubtype=0.04 and ùõΩstage=-0.06, p<0.01 for all). In external datasets, compared to

the cortex-first, the lesion-first subtype had a shorter time to EDSS progression (hazard ratios
range=1.75 to 1.82 across trials, p<0.01) and higher disease activity (p<0.05 for relapse rate
and gad-enhancing lesions). In three progressive MS trials the lesion-first subtype showed the
greatest treatment response (64% more than the cortex-first, p<0.001).
Interpretation
Data-driven MS subtypes and stages, when compared with clinical classification or baseline
EDSS better predicts the subsequent clinical course and treatment response. Data-driven
subtyping has the potential to prospectively enrich clinical trials with patients who are more
likely to respond to treatments.

Research in Context
Evidence before this study
We searched the Medline database for entries with ‚Äúmultiple sclerosis‚Äù and ‚Äúclinical
classification‚Äù keywords in their title or abstract published before February 2019. We found
two consensus-based recommendations defining MS disease courses. First, in 1996, Lublin
and colleagues who devised clinical classification for multiple sclerosis (MS) based on clinical
evolution into relapse-onset or progressive onset course. This definition was revised in 2013
with specific terms for relapsing-remitting, secondary progressive and primary progressive
terms while considering underlying processes from clinical or brain imaging assessments
(progression and disease activity). However, the clinical classification of MS is retrospective
and the boundary between MS phenotypes remains subjective mainly based on clinical
evolution.

Added value of this study
Here we applied machine learning methods to brain magnetic-resonance imaging to identify
data-driven subgroups of patients who share similar patterns in accumulation of abnormalities
in large cohorts from recent double-blind randomised controlled trials of MS. We found three
subtypes with a distinct neuroanatomical spread of abnormality. These data-driven subtypes
could predict disability progression, disease activity, and treatment response in relapse-onset
and progressive MS and even within patients with a single clinical subtype.

Implications of the all available evidence
Data-driven MS subtyping has the potential to enrich trial cohorts with those who have the
most potential to demonstrate treatment effects.

Introduction
There are four courses of multiple sclerosis (MS): clinically-isolated syndrome (CIS),
relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), primary-progressive MS (PPMS) and secondary progressive
MS (SPMS).1 These clinical subtypes are based on the current patient status and historical
data. In 2013 a revised MS phenotype description has added two modifiers to the basic MS
phenotypes: disease activity (relapses and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) and
progression of disability2. Since these additional descriptors reflect acute inflammation and
neurodegeneration, they may help to prognosticate patient outcomes and enhance
homogeneity of disease course in clinical trials. The four clinical phenotypes of MS and their
additional modifiers are routinely used in the clinical setting and clinical trials.

When examining the clinical, imaging, immunologic, or pathologic characteristics of the four
clinical courses of MS, it is clear that the differences between the MS subtypes are relative
rather than absolute. SPMS and PPMS share more similarities than differences in MRI
features and pathogenic mechanisms.3 A CIS phenotype may evolve into RRMS, and RRMS
phenotype may transition into SPMS.2,4 Therefore, different phenotypes are often used
together in clinical trials5,6. When these transitions happen exactly is challenging to ascertain,
because they are often based on the subjective recollection of symptoms and their evolution.
Subgroup analyses of clinical trials have often detected treatment effects not seen when all
patients were analysed together6,7. Overall, these considerations suggest the need for a
greater sophistication in the definition of MS phenotypes.

New opportunities for further progress in defining the phenotypes of MS may arise if objective
indicators of a patient's biological status are used. MRI features are closer to the biology of
MS than clinical symptoms, and MRI abnormalities are the manifestations of pathogenetic
mechanisms occurring in MS.8 The overarching hypothesis of our work is that the definition of
MS and its subtypes can be linked with the biology of the disease, as reflected by MRI
abnormalities, instead of clinical features. The consequence of this new framework, which

does not define MS phenotypes on the basis of clinical symptoms and course of disability over
time, but describes them as a consequence of the pathological changes visible on MRI scans,
will represent an important step towards personalised medicine, since it will lead to the use of
therapies to target patient populations who share the same pathogenic mechanisms of the
disease.9

To redefine the MS phenotypes on the basis of MRI abnormalities we analysed a large number
of MRI scans in patients with RRMS, SPMS and PPMS, using a machine learning algorithm,
called Subtype and Staging Inference (SuStaIn),10 which can disentangle the different patterns
of MRI changes. We have recently developed and tested this algorithm in patients with
Alzheimer‚Äôs disease.10 SuStaIn identifies data-driven patient subtypes who accumulate MRI
abnormalities with similar patterns and enables identification of subgroups using crosssectional MRI data. SuStaIn determines how closely information from a given patient matches
‚Äòlearned‚Äô data-driven subtypes, and what stage the given patient has reached at a particular
time.

Here we performed MRI-driven subtyping of patients by pooling data from several randomised
controlled trials in MS and tested the external generalisability of our model in an independent
data set using SuStaIn. We aimed to: (1) Define MS subtypes on the basis of MRI-derived
patterns and test whether they were associated with clinical outcome more strongly than
standard MS phenotypes; (2) Test whether there was a difference in treatment response
between MRI-driven subtypes; and (3) Stage patients along the trajectory of MRI changes to
predict clinical outcomes.

Material and methods
Participants
We carried out this retrospective study under the auspices of the International Progressive
MS Alliance (www.progressivemsalliance.org). We collected clinical and magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI) data from the following 14 MS randomised-controlled trials (RCTs): five trials
of PPMS7,11‚Äì13, five trials of SPMS14‚Äì18, and four trials of RRMS19‚Äì21 (Table 1). We also
gathered three observational cohorts with mixed MS subtypes,7,11‚Äì26 and two datasets from
healthy volunteers.

Each RCT and observational study had received ethical approval and patients had given
written, informed consents at the time of data-acquisition. The Institutional Review Board at
the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), Quebec, Canada approved this study (Reference
number: IRB00010120). The pharmaceutical companies that provided the fully anonymised,
individual patient raw data, signed an agreement with the McGill University, which allowed
pooling data but not testing treatment response in individual RCT.

Healthy volunteers
We downloaded unprocessed MRI data from: (1) The S1200 Open Access release of the
Human Connectome Project, (2) The UK Biobank data, which were available for download on
1st of February 2019; this project was approved by the UK Biobank (Reference number:
47233).

Clinical outcomes
The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)27, which rates neurological impairment, was
scored as per individual study protocol. The EDSS was obtained at least 1-month prior to or
after a protocol-defined relapse. We defined disability progression confirmed at 24-week as
a worsening of EDSS that was sustained on subsequent visits for at least 24 weeks. EDSS
progression was defined as a ‚â•1.5-point increase from a baseline EDSS of 0, a ‚â•1-point
increase from a baseline score of 0.5 to 5.5, a ‚â•0.5-point increase from a baseline score
greater than 5.5.
Brain MRI Protocol
We included visits where all the following brain MRI sequences were acquired: T1-weighted,
T2-weighted, and Fluid Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRI. The MRI protocol of
three cohorts did not include FLAIR scans (see Supplemental Material for details).
We used brain 2D or 3D T1-weighted scans to obtain grey and white matter segmentations,
FLAIR and T1-weighted scans to segment lesions, and T2-weighted scans, together with T1weighted scans, to obtain T1/T2 ratio. Details of MRI protocols are explained in previous
publications (Table 1).
Image processing
We processed MRI scans from MS and healthy volunteers with our pipeline to obtain the
following

Statistical analysis
Outline
In the following steps, we trained, cross-validated, and externally tested our data-driven
subtyping and staging machine learning algorithm (SuStaIn) following our previously
developed pipeline10 (Figure 1):
1) Adjusting neuroimaging measures for nuisance variables;
2) Calculating Z-score of MRI-derived measures based on the healthy control population;
3) Separating a priori MS trials and cohorts into a ‚Äútrain and cross-validation set‚Äù and an
‚Äúexternal test set‚Äù;
4) Selecting MRI-derived variables using only the train and cross-validation set;
5) Computational modelling using SuStaIn to select the optimal number of MS subtypes
and quantify the uncertainty of the model, by carrying out the leave-one-dataset-out
cross-validation;
6) Testing the trained model on the external test set.

volume, visible white matter lesion from FLAIR, and T1/T2 ratio. We used the population
of healthy volunteers to develop norms, calculate Z-scores, and select MRI variables. A
priori we split our large patient dataset into two separate datasets: 14 datasets in the ‚Äútrain
and cross-validation‚Äù sets, and three datasets in the external test set: CLIMB (an
observational study), BRAVO (a phase III RRMS trial), and ORATORIO (a phase III PPMS
trial). We used the train-cross-validation set to choose the optimal number of subtypes
and to quantify the uncertainty. We applied the trained model on the external test set to
subtype and stage patients.

sclerosis; PPMS, primary progressive multiple sclerosis; MRI, magnetic resonance

We now explain each step below:
1) Adjusting for nuisance variables: age, sex, total intracranial volume, trial and MRI
protocol
For each of the neuroimaging variables, we used the population of healthy volunteers to fit a
Bayesian linear regression model with total intracranial volume, sex, and age as independent
variables, and each neuroimaging measure as the outcome variable. We predicted expected
values for each subject using this model and subtracted the observed values to obtain residual
values of each neuroimaging variable. We refer to the residual values as ‚Äúadjusted values‚Äù.
We used BAS package version 1.5.3 inside R version 3.6.028. Each trial had a different MRI
protocol. We chose not to adjust for MRI protocol inside the abovementioned statistical models
because differences in eligibility criteria and differences in MRI protocols would perfectly mirror
each other in statistical models and would have regressed out the effects of interest. To ensure
that our results were robust to trial-specific nuisance effects, we used a separate method
inside the cross-validation (see below for details).

All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.

2) Norm development and Z-score calculation
We calculated the Z-score for each MRI variable at each participant‚Äôs visit by subtracting the
adjusted mean value of the healthy volunteers from the adjusted observed value and dividing
it by the standard deviation of the healthy volunteers.

3) Creation of the train and cross-validation and test sets
From the 17 datasets available, we a priori chose 14 datasets for the train and cross-validation
set. These were three phase 3 RRMS trials, three phase 3 PPMS trials, two phase 3 SPMS
trial, three phase 2 SPMS trials, one phase 2 PPMS trial, and two observational cohorts (see
Table 1 and Figure 1 for the complete list).
The remaining three datasets, which were one phase 3 trial in RRMS, one phase 3 trial in
PPMS, and one observational cohort in relapase-onset MS, were set aside and used as test
set, to ascertain the external generalisability of the newly developed model.

4) Variable selection in the train and cross-validation set
To reduce the dimensionality of the models and computational expenses we selected
variables which were more likely to be affected in MS. To do so, we calculated the effect size
of the difference between healthy volunteers and patients at their baseline visit in the train and
cross-validation dataset and selected those associated with a moderate to large effect size
(>0.5 Cohen‚Äôs D effect size) in pairwise (MS vs. HC) comparisons.

5) Computational modelling using SuStaIn
We used Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn)10, which is an unsupervised machine
learning algorithm previously used in Alzheimer‚Äôs disease and frontotemporal dementia. In
short, SuStaIn identifies data-driven subgroups who share patterns of worsening over time in
MRI abnormalities by combining unsupervised learning (clustering) and disease progression
modelling. SuStaIn extends the ‚Äúevent-based‚Äù models, previously used to identify single
trajectories of change in MS29 and other neurodegenerative disorders30,31. SuStaIn

simultaneously estimates a set of subtypes, the trajectory (or sequence of progression of MRI
abnormalities, described as a Z-score model) of each subtype, and a probabilistic assignment
of each subject to a specific subtype and stage within a subtype. Methodological details of the
SuStaIn algorithm are explained in detail elsewhere10.

In this study we used models with three Z-scores (1, 2, and 3) to provide interpretable results
on mild, moderate and severe abnormality as patients progress. We entered the variables
resulting from the previous step into SuStaIn. Since lower values of volumes and T1/T2 ratios
are expected to be associated with increased EDSS scores, we flipped their signs so that
higher Z-scores and estimated stages represented disease worsening.

Leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation in the train and cross-validation set
We carried out the leave-one-dataset-out cross-validation, in order to choose the number of
MS subtypes, quantify the uncertainty associated with a given subtype ‚Äútrajectory‚Äù (or the
evolution of MRI abnormalities), and test the stability and robustness of the model across
different trials, field strengths, and MRI protocols. In the leave-one-dataset-out crossvalidation, we trained the model on 13 out of the 14 datasets, contained in the train and crossvalidation set, and evaluated on the remaining dataset (held-out sample). We permuted the
training and held-out samples until every dataset was used for evaluation once. The aims of
this step were to:
(1) Select the best fitting model, which means the model with the optimal number of
subtypes, and sequence of MRI progression in those subtypes. We started by fitting
SuStaIn on the training set with only one subtype and then increased the number of
subtypes one by one. We calculated the log-likelihood of each fitted model on the
held-out sample, and then compared it with the next model with an extra subtype. We
chose the best fitting model when log-likelihood of a given model did not show
improvement on the held-out sample.

(2) Calculate the uncertainty of the quantification (posterior distribution); we used the
Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm with 100,000 iterations to sample from
the posterior distribution of the most likely sequence found in the previous step. We
sampled the posterior distribution across cross-validation folds to quantify the
agreement and trial-specific effects.
(3) Quantify the effects of study and MRI protocol on subtype trajectory; we quantified
the degree of overlap of posterior distributions of sequences for each subtype across
14 iterations of cross-validation. We used the Bhattacharya coefficient for this
purpose between each pair of subtypes from different folds. The Bhattacharya
coefficient ranges from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement). We calculated all
pairwise Bhattacharya distances across all folds and subtypes pairs for the best
model (which was the three-subtype model) and reported the average and standard
deviation for each subtype.
(4) Train a unique model on all the train-cross-validation dataset; because each iteration
of cross-validation generates a separate ‚Äútrained‚Äù model, we trained a final model,
with three subtypes, on all the train-cross-validation dataset to obtain one model for
external testing. We also used this model to obtain MCMC samples and visualised
the uncertainty of the final model with the posterior distribution of this model.
We performed additional analysis to test the reliability and stability of the SuStaIn subtypes
over time (see Supplemental Material for details).

6) Testing SuStaIn on the external, unseen dataset
We tested our subtyping model on the external test set, which we did not use in the model
development. This test set contained the phase III RCT in RRMS (BRAVO)21, the phase III
RCT in PPMS (ORATORIO)13, and the observational study in relapse-onset MS (CLIMB)

26

(Table 1). In the BRAVO RCT and CLIMB study, we performed a survival analysis to calculate
the time to 24-week confirmed EDSS progression of each data-driven MS subtype. In the
phase 3 RCT in PPMS (ORATORIO), we considered only the placebo arm for the longitudinal

analysis because the time-to-event analysis was modified by the experimental drug13. Since
the number of 24-week confirmed EDSS progression events per MS subtype in the placebo
group was too small (<23 events per subtype on average) to provide statistically reliable
results, we defined an event as ‚â•20% increase in the averaged 9 Hole-Peg Test time between
two hands, following Wolinsky et al‚Äôs recommendation32.
We used Cox regression models to calculate the hazard ratios of reaching the 24-week
confirmed disability progression in the three data-driven MS subtypes. To investigate whether
there were differences in disease activity between the data-driven subtypes, we used the
annual relapse rate in the BRAVO RCT and CLIMB study (in the ORATORIO trial relapses
were extremely rare) and the number of gadolinium-enhancing lesions at baseline in the
BRAVO and ORATORIO trials, which was previously reported13,21 (the CLIMB study which did
not include this variable). We used a Poisson model in which the lesion count at baseline in
all patients (placebo and treatment arms) was the outcome and the data-driven subtype was
the independent variable.

MS clinical classification and EDSS vs. data-driven subtyping and staging
SuStaIn estimates subtype stages along a trajectory or a ‚Äòsequence‚Äô. Since we had 13
variables with three Z-scores, each subtype had 39 stages: from one (early) to 39 (late). To

baseline, clinical classifications, age, sex, and EDSS at baseline.

Treatment response in data-driven subtypes
To test whether there is a difference in the treatment response between the SuStaIn subtypes,
we looked at the rate (or slope) of EDSS worsening in three progressive MS trials
(ORATORIO, ASCEND, and OLYMPUS) pooled together, and in three RRMS trials (DEFINE-

because had at least 100 patients per data-driven subtype, and were either positive trials or
had a subgroup that had shown a trend towards a treatment response in previous publications.
For the DEFINE-CONFIRM-ENDORSE, we merged the two arms with different doses of the
drug, included the placebo arm, and excluded the active comparator arm. We used a linear
mixed effects model in which EDSS was the outcome variable with ‚Äògroup‚Äô, time, and grouptime interaction as the independent variables. ‚ÄòGroup‚Äô was a binary variable for each of the
data-driven subtypes (placebo or treatment for that subtype). To adjust for repeated measures
and correlated residual errors, we added hierarchical random effects to our model, in which
visits were nested in the ‚Äòsubject‚Äô variable. We reported the difference between groups in
percentage change of EDSS worsening rates across groups, which we refer to as ‚Äòtreatment
response‚Äô throughout this manuscript. We used NLME package version 3.1 and Survival
package version 2.44 inside R version 3.6.0 for statistical analysis33,34.

Results
Demographic characteristics of patients and healthy controls
We processed MRI data from 8,545 participants with MS who had a total of 31,451 MRI visits
from 17 datasets (Table 1). Demographic information was available for 8,241 patients (5,226
women and 3,015 men), whose mean age was 42.31 years (standard deviation 10.5, range:
18 to 69). At baseline visit ‚Äìdefined as the first available clinical assessment‚Äì out of 7,923
patients with available clinical information, 4,157 were RRMS, 2,077 PPMS, and 1,689 SPMS.

We also processed MRI scans of 14,928 volunteers (13,823 from the UK Biobank and 1,105
from the Human Connectome Project; 7,965 women and 6,963 men). Their mean age was
52.94 years (standard deviation 9.98, range: 23.5 to 70).

MRI variables selected for the train and cross-validation set
Out of the 18 MRI variables analysed, 13 were associated with a moderate to large effect size
when patients were compared with healthy controls, and, therefore were selected and entered
into the subtyping algorithm. They were: the volumes of the occipital, parietal, limbic and
frontal grey matter, the deep grey matter volume, the total white matter lesion load, and T1/T2
ratio in the corpus callosum, temporal, pariental, cerebellar and frontal normal appearing white
matter regions. Figure 2a shows the location and effect sizes of the included variables. The
remaining 5 variables were excluded.

Three data-driven subtypes best fit the data
The three-subtype model was associated with the highest log-likelihood in the left-out set and
therefore considered to be the best model for the data (Figure 2b). The two-subtype models
showed 11.1% (standard deviation=5.7) increase in log-likelihood compared to one-subtype
model and three-subtype models showed 2.1% (standard deviation= 1.9) improvement in loglikelihood than the two-subtype model. The four-subtype model did not show improvement

values favour better models. We found that three subtypes provided the best accuracy
(according to log-likelihood) to evaluate subtypes in the lef-out-set.

When looking at how abnormalities spread across the brain in each subtype, we termed them
as follows: (1) The cortex-first subtype (44% of participants, n=3480): starting from the cortical
atrophy in the occipital, parietal, and frontal lob GM atrophy before spreading to other areas
and preceding lesion accrual, (2) The normal appearing WM (NAWM)-first subtype (30%,
n=2369): starting from the reduction in the T1/T2 in the cingulate white matter and the corpus
callosum then spreading to the cerebellar white matter abnormality (reduction T1/T1) and late
appearance of lesions, and (3) The lesion-first subtype (26%, n=2074) (Figure 3a and
Supplementary Figure 1): starting from severe (sigma> 3) accumulation of lesions, and early
deep grey matter atrophy, with a later cortical atorphy. The three subtypes were similar in
gender distribution: the cortex-first subtype there were 2182 women (62.6%) and 1299 men,
in patients with NAWM-first subtype there were 1552 (65.51%) women and 817 men, and in
patients with the lesion-first subtype there were 1311 (63.2%) women and 762 men. Patients
in these three data-driven subtypes were similar in age (mean ¬± standard deviation of age in
the cortex-first=41.11¬±10.13, NAWM-first=42.61¬±11.04, and lesion first=41.98¬±10.74). The
lesion first subtype had a slightly higher median EDSS at baseline (median=4, 0-9) compared
to the other two subtypes (median EDSS for cortex-first 3.5, and NAWM-first=3.5). The lesion
first subtype had a longer disease duration (8.03 years) compared to the other two subtypes
which was statistically significant (5.4 years for the cortex-first and 5.1 years for the NAWMfirst, effect size=0.3 (small), p<0.01). The lesion-first subtype had the highest lesion load at
baseline (p<0.001). The cortex first subtype had the smallest cortex at baseline(p<0.01). Over
time, the lesion-first subtype had the slowest rate of cortical atrophy (p<0.001) compared to
the cortex-first and NAWM-first subtypes. Table 2 and Figure 3b show these baseline
characteristics.

or severe which approximates 1,2 and, 3 Z-score) relative to healthy volunteers. The most
common subtype was the cortex-first subtype (left) which has cortical atrophy in the occipital,
temporal and frontal cortex at early stages. The normal-appearing white matter (NAWM)
damage-first subtype (middle) had early damage in T1/T2 of the corpus callosum and does
not show visible white matter lesion until later stages. The lesion-first subtype (right) shows
early severe accumulation of lesions, early severe atrophy in the deep gray matter which later
spreads to other areas. The numbers on the left side represent SuStaIn stages. The minimum
stage is 1 and the maximum stage is 39 (based on 13 variables that can show mild, moderate
and severe abnormality; 13x3 = 39). (b) The cortex first subtype was the most common in
PPMS and RRMS patients. The lesion-first subtype was the most common in the SPMS

in the right side of (b) section of the figure.

13.81 (¬±0.1) in lesion-first subtype¬∑ There was significant annual increase (p<0.001 for all
tests) in stages across patients in the three subtypes, giving confidence to reliability of datadriven staging. Estimated average (¬±standard error) of annual increase of SuStaIn stage in
cortex-first was 0.27 (¬±0.02), in the NAWM-first was 0.17 (¬±0.02), and in the lesion-first
subtype was 0.20 (¬±0.02).

External validity and generalizability in unseen datasets: disability progression and
disease activity
a) Disability progression: the lesion-first subtype had a higher risk of developing 24week confirmed EDSS progression
BRAVO
There was a significant difference in reaching 24-week confirmed EDSS progression between
the three groups (log-rank test for three-group comparison p=0.003). Patients with the lesionfirst subtype had 82% (95% confidence interval: 48.6%-115%, p<0.001) higher risk of reaching
the 24-week confirmed EDSS progression compared to the cortex-first subtype. There was no
difference in reaching the confirmed disability progression between the cortex-first and
NAWM-first subtypes. Figure 4 shows the survival plots for these analyses.
ORATORIO
When looking at all patients (placebo and treatment arms), the lesion-first subtype had the
highest EDSS across three subtypes at baseline: model-estimated average difference with
the cortex-first subtype was 0.33 (standard error = 0.10, p=0.001) and with the NAWM-first
subtype was 0.35 (standard error=0.13, p=0.01). NAWM-first subtype and cortex-first subtype
had similar EDSS at baseline (estimated difference=-0.02, standard error =0.12, p=0.8). There
were 196 progression events based on ‚â•20% increase of 9-Hole Peg Test time in the placebo
arm. The lesion-first subtype had a significantly shorter time to reach this disability milestone
(hazard ratio =2.01, 95% confidence interval=1.33 to 3.33, p=0.007) compared to the cortexfirst subtype, but not the NAWM-first subtype (hazard ratio = 2.027, 95% confidence
interval=0.96 to 4.26, p=0.06). This means that at any particular time the lesion-first subtype

patients were almost twice (101% more) as likely to reach the disability milestone as the
cortex-first subtype.
CLIMB
In the observational CLIMB dataset, there were 212 patients who had sufficient clinical
information for this analysis, of whom 111 had 24-week confirmed EDSS progression. Patients
with the lesion-first subtype had a significantly shorter time to reach 24-week confirmed EDSS
progression compared to the other two subtypes (log-rank test p=0.035). The hazard ratio
(95% confidence interval) for reaching 24-week confirmed EDSS progression was 1.75 (1.322.18, Cox model regression coefficient p = 0.01) in the lesion-first group vs. NAWM-first.
Therefore, at any particular time, patients in the lesion-first group had on average 75% (32%118%) higher risk of reaching 24-week confirmed progression than the NAWM-first subtype.
There was no significant difference in the hazard ratio of developing confirmed EDSS
progression in the lesion-first subtype vs. cortex-first.

b) Disease activity: data-driven subtyping could predict disease activity
BRAVO: lesion-first subtype had a higher rate of annual relapse rate and a higher
count of gadolinium-enhancing lesions
Estimated average (¬±95% confidence interval) annual relapse rate for the cortex-first subtype
was 0.33 (0.29-0.37), for the NAWM-first was 0.37 (0.32-0.42), and for the lesion-first subtype
was 0.43 (0.35-0.51). Thus, the difference between the lesion-first vs the cortex-first subtype
was statistically significant (p=0.04). When looking at gadolinium-enhancing lesion counts, at
baseline in placebo and treatment arms, the lesion-first subtype had an average of 3.44
lesions per subject, which was significantly higher than the cortex-first subtype (Poisson model
estimated difference in count with the cortex-first subtype= 146%, standard error = 20.5%, p
<0.001). The NAWM-first and the cortex-first subtypes had similar T1-weighted gadenhancing lesion counts (average of 0.72 and 1.2, p=0.1). Figure 4C shows these results.
ORATORIO: there were more gadolinium enhancing lesions in the lesion-first subtype

When looking at gadolinium-enhancing lesions, at baseline in patients (placebo and treatment
arms), the lesion-first subtype had an average of 2.25 lesions per subject, which was
significantly higher than the cortex-first subtype (Poisson model estimated difference in count
with the cortex-first subtype= 429%, standard error = 109%, p <0.01). The NAWM-first subtype
and the cortex-first subtype had similar T1-weighted gadolinium-enhancing lesion counts
(average of 0.42 and 0.21, p=0.3). Relapses were too rare to provide statistically reliable
results. Figure 4 shows these results.

Data-driven subtyping and staging could better predict 24-week confirmed EDSS
progression than clinical phenotypes or baseline EDSS
There were significant associations (standardised ùõΩ) between data-driven subtypes (overall
subtype effect, ùõΩ = 0.04, standard error = 0.01, p = 0.02) or data-driven baseline stages (ùõΩ =
-0.06, standard error=0.02, p<0.001) with the time to reach 24-week confirmed EDSS
progression. However, there were no significant associations of clinical classification of MS
(overall effect across RR, SP and PP MS ùõΩ =0.18, standard error = 0.15, p=0.22) or baseline
EDSS (ùõΩ =0.02, standard error = 0.03, p=0.26) with time to reach 24-week EDSS progression
in the same model, suggesting that data-driven subtyping and staging has a better predictive
value for clinical progression, than EDSS at baseline or clinical phenotypes.

Treatment response
Progressive MS
Patients in the lesion-first subtype had the largest slowing in EDSS worsening in pooled
dataset of anti-inflammatory drug trials in progressive MS
In our pooled analysis of ORATORIO, ASCEND, and OLYMPUS the percentage change in
EDSS worsening of each data-driven subtype with respect to the same subtype on treatment
was as follows (each subtype on treatment vs. same subtype on placebo; model estimated
percentage average difference ¬± standard error; negative values represent slowing of EDSS
worsening):

- Lesion first: -66% (¬±25.6%), p=0.009
- NAWM-first: -22% (¬±25.06%), p=0.06
- Cortex-first: 27.6% (¬±20.17%), p=0.7
This suggests that the lesion-first subtype had the greatest treatment response. Figure 4d
shows these results.
RRMS
In our pooled analysis of OPERA1, 2, and DEFINE/CONFIRM/ENDORSE, the percentage
change of EDSS worsening for each subtype on treatment vs placebo (or active comparator)
was as follows:
-

Lesion-first: -89% (¬± 44%), p=0.04

-

NAWM-first: -75% (¬±198%), p=0.74

-

Cortex-first: 63% (¬±164%), p=0.70

This suggests that the lesion-first subtype had the greatest treatment response, irrespective
of clinical phenotypes of MS.
Longitudinal subtyping: the majority of patients did not change subtype over time providing
confidence in our data-driven subtyping
When we looked at 5,973 subjects who were assigned to one of the three data-driven subtypes
with probability of more than 95% at study entry (baseline), during the follow up only 8%
changed subtype. When we increased the probability threshold to 99% (4,525 subjects at
baseline), only 6% of subjects changed subtype over time (94% stayed in the same subtype).
When including all subjects without a threshold of probability in subtyping, 25% of patients
changed subtype over time.

Staging and stratification
Patients with higher SuStaIn stage at baseline had a faster EDSS progression
Patients who had the highest tertile of SuStaIn stage at baseline (17 to 39) had the shortest
time to 24-week confirmed EDSS progression (independent of subtype, log-rank p<0.0001).

worsening, which was numerically lower than the normal appearing white matter damage first subtype,
and statistically significantly lower than the cortex first subtype.

Discussion
To our knowledge this is the first data-driven subtyping of MS to demonstrate significantly
better predictive value for treatment response and disability progression than clinical
phenotypes. Our subtypes showed high reliability across 14 datasets and were robust to
nuisance effects of different MRI protocols. We tested our model in three external datasets
and with variables that we did not use in training our model (relapses, gadolinium-enhanicing
lesions, EDSS worsening, and Nine-hole Peg Test performance). We found that subtyping of
patients could predict disability progression, treatment response, and disease activity (relapse
rate and gadolinium-enhancing lesions). We stratified patients according to the SuStaIn stage,
we found that higher stages at baseline could predict faster disability progression. SuStaIn
provided consistent results across trials and when applied longitudinally suggesting excellent
reliability; when we subtyped patients over time, 94% of patients who were assigned with high
certainty to a subtype stayed in the same subtype. Our subtyping model has the potential to
be used prospectively to enrich clinical trials.
A striking finding was the absence of one-to-one correspondence between data-driven
subtypes and clinical MS phenotypes. This confirms previous observations that clinical MS
phenotypes do not represent distinct pathological entities3,4,35. Even within the same MS
clinical phenotype, SuStaIn could identify patients who were more likely to clinically progress
during follow-up (e.g., RRMS patients in the BRAVO trial or PPMS patients in the
ORATORIO), and progressive MS patients who were most likely to respond to treatment
(OLYMPUS, ORATORIO, and ASCEND), and RRMS patients who were most likely to
respond to treatments (OPERA1, OPERA2, and DEFINE-CONFIRM-ENDORSE). Since our
data-driven subtyping only requires data from a single visit, it has the potential to prospectively
enrich trials with those most likely to respond to treatment.

The lesion-first subtype was the least common (26% overall), a slightly higher proportion was
classified as NAWM-first (30%), and a more substantial proportion as cortex-first (44%).
Counterintuitively, in RRMS, a cortex-first subtype was more common than a lesion-first
subtype (47.9% and 24.1% respectively) but in SPMS the proportion classified as having a
lesion-first subtype was substantially higher (40.06% and 39.1% respectively). However, given
that not all those with RRMS will develop SPMS, a plausible explanation is that the lesion-first
subtype is more likely to be associated with disability progression. Therefore, our RRMS group
represents a combination of those less likely (cortex-first) and more likely (lesion-first) to
eventually develop SPMS. The lesion first subtype had a faster EDSS progression, which
further supports these findings.
Our findings provide insights into the sequence and focus of pathology, albeit with the caveat
that MRI measures are not pathologically specific. The most common MRI phenotype was the
cortex-first with faster cortical atrophy rates but lower lesion volumes. Cortical atrophy in this
subtype started posteriorly and spread forward, increasingly involving deep grey matter, with
abnormalities in NAWM occurring late and with relatively modest WM lesion accumulation.
This suggests a pathological process that is predominantly in the cortex rather than WMbased, dominated by posterior and then more extensive neurodegeneration (as reflected by
atrophy)36,37. In contrast, the lesion-first subtype starts with marked accumulation of lesions,
severe early atrophy in the deep grey matter structures, and then cortical atrophy, with NAWM
abnormalities as a late feature. This suggests a process more closely linked with WM lesion
accrual, and these findings are consistent with neurodegeneration in deep grey matter
secondary to lesion accumulation

36,37

. This may extend previous findings that cortical

abnormalities may also be the result of WM lesion effects on tracts38,39. The sequence of the
NAWM-first subtype suggests a more diffuse process, with limited WM lesion formation even
by the late stages, and subsequent GM abnormalities detectable anteriorly and then
posteriorly. It is worth noting that patients could belong to multiple MRI-driven subtypes
simultaneously, although most (75%) showed a clear dominance of one subtype (defined by
probabilistic assignment to each subtype in SuStaIn models). In part this may be due to the

precision with which SuStaIn could subtype people based on the available data, but it also
raises the possibility that for some people with MS, multiple pathological mechanisms may
contribute to disease progression.
Our study was not without limitations. Different MRI protocols from different trials could limit
our conclusions. However, to mitigate the effects of MRI protocol we repeated our analysis
using leave-one-dataset out cross validation and found excellent agreement between
trajectories (sequence of progression of abnormality) between the three subtypes. Moreover,
when we applied our model in external datasets, which had different protocols, we found
consistent results which proves that our model is robust to different protocol effects. Secondly,
spinal cord is affected from early stages in MS and its atrophy is associated with disability40.
However, spinal cord data is not routinely acquired in MS trials and was not available in our
study. Future studies with spinal cord data should investigate whether spinal cord measures
can contribute to SuStaIn subtyping and staging, and whether or not they do so independently
or concurrently with brain atrophy.
MRI data-driven subtyping can predict the future clinical course of MS based on a single set
of scans. Data-driven subtyping has the potential to be used prospectively to enrich clinical
trials with patients who are more likely to respond to treatments.

Supplemental material
Brain MRI Protocol
MRI protocols differed between trials but inside each trial a unique MRI protocol has been
used (except for the CLIMB study). We included brain 2D or 3D T1-weighted, fluid attenuated
inversion recovery (FLAIR), and T2-weighted MRI scans. Supplementary Table 1 shows the
list of included trials with corresponding publications that reported details of MRI protocol.
In the CLIMB study, in which the MRI protocol had changed over time from 2D T1-weighted
MRI to 3D, we only included more recent 3D T1 weighted MRI data.
Supplmental Methods
Image analysis
Brain MRI data handling
We checked and labelled the sequence of MRI scans by visually inspecting nine slices of each
MRI scan (three axial, three sagittal, and three coronal slices) with equal slice intervals from
the coordinates of the ‚Äúcentre of gravity‚Äù of each scan. We organised and uploaded MRI data
to an XNAT server (version 1.7.4)43. We implemented our image analysis pipeline inside XNAT
with Nipype version 1.1.4 to enable large-scale high-throughput computing44.
Regional brain volume calculation
We aimed to analyse scans to extract volumes of the grey matter regions according to an
established

brain

atlas

developed

by

Klein

and

Tourville

(Neuromorphometrics,

http://www.neuromorphometrics.com, see above for the list)45. We applied an identical crosssectional pipeline (treating each visit independently) to all the visits of patients and healthy
controls in which T1-weighted, FLAIR and T2-weighted MRI were available. We chose a
cross-sectional, rather than a longitudinal image processing pipeline, to ensure that our
subtyping models can be used prospectively in the real-world datasets in which (future) follow
up data are not yet acquired. We adapted our established MRI analysis pipeline, which we
had previously validated in clinical trials and observational cohorts as explained elsewhere in
detail46,47. Briefly, it included intensity inhomogeneity correction of the T1-weighted MRI with
ITK version 5.0 N4-bias field correction algorithm48, automatic segmentation of hyperintense

a deep convolutional neural network based method in DeepMedic version 0.7.150), rigid
registration of FLAIR to T1-weighted MRI with co-registration of the FLAIR lesion masks to
T1-weighted MRI using ANTs version 2.1.0, and lesion filling with NiftySeg version 1.051. We
segmented and parcellated the brain into Neuromorphometrics atlas regions on lesion-filled
T1-weighted scans using the Geodesic Information Flows (GIF) software version 3.052. We
used a modified version of this pipeline for the Siena cohort, ARPEGGIO and lamotrigine trials
which did not have FLAIR but whose investigators had provided manually delineated lesion
masks.

T1/T2 ratio calculation of the normal-appearing white matter regions

Lesion masks or brain volumes do not provide any quantitative information on
microstructural changes in the white matter. We therefore chose T1/T2 ratio as a
measure of extra-lesional white matter changes, because T1 and T2-weighted MRI
are widely available in clinical trials and clinical practice (as opposed to more
advanced MRI sequences such as diffusion imaging or magnetisation transfer ratio).
T1/T2 ratio is an extensively used measures of microstructural changes53,54. We
adapted available pipelines from the Human Connectome Project to calculate T1/T2
ratio maps for all trials55. We corrected for intensity inhomogeneity in T1 and T2weighted MRI scans with N4 bias field correction algorithm. Next, we rigid-registered
T1 and T2-weighted scans in a symmetric space, such that both modalities equally
underwent only one interpolation to minimise interpolation artefacts. We calculated the
T1/T2 ratio and normalised its value against the average T1/T2 ratio in the ventricles
with the co-registered ventricular masks obtained from the GIF segmentation
(explained above). We extracted T1/T2 ratio from bilateral normal-appearing white
matter regions (see above for list of regions) after we removed co-registered lesions

segmented in FLAIR from the white matter regions, which we refer to as normal
appearing T1/T2 ratio throughout this manuscript. Since the T1/T2 ratio in the grey
matter regions were highly correlated with grey matter volumetric results, we did not
include any T1/T2 ratio in the grey matter in our models.

Quality control
We developed a pipeline to check the quality of results of our pipeline by automatically
generating 18 images from segmentation results, lesion segmentations, and
registration results which we manually reviewed. We re-ran image analysis pipeline
where we identified mis-registrations or faulty segmentations. We did not exclude any
visit in clinical trials to perform an intention-to-treat analysis in individuals who met the
minimal MRI criteria (which was availability of T1-, T2-weighted, and FLAIR).

Supplemental Statistical Analysis
Reliability and stability of SuStaIn models: longitudinal subtyping
In addition to subtyping patients at baseline, we trained our model on the baseline subjects
and predicted the probability of subtype membership for the available patient visits over time
(31,451 visits). We reported the number of subjects who preserved the subtype membership.
To calculate the annual rate of change in SuStaIn stages for each data-driven subtype, we fit
a mixed-effects model in which the SuStaIn stage was an outcome variable and time was the
independent variable (fixed effects). In these models to adjust for hierarchical repeated
measures, we defined nested random effects in which ‚Äòtime‚Äô variable was nested in the
‚Äòsubject‚Äô variable. To calculate longitudinal cortical atrophy in each subtype we used a similar
