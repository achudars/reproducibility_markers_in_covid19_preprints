ABSTRACT

2

Objective: Hospitalisation-associated disability (HAD, defined as the loss of ability to

3

perform one or more basic activities of daily living [ADL] independently at discharge) is

4

a frequent condition among older patients. The present study aimed to assess whether a

5

simple inpatient exercise programme decreases the incidence of HAD in acutely

6

hospitalised very old patients.

7

Design: In this randomized controlled trial (Activity in GEriatric acute CARe, AGECAR)

8

participants were assigned to a control or intervention (exercise) group, and were assessed

9

at baseline, admission, discharge, and 3 months thereafter.

10

Setting and participants: 268 patients (mean age 88 years, range 75–102) admitted to an

11

acute care for elders (ACE) unit of a Public Hospital were randomized to a control

12

(n=125) or intervention (exercise) group (n=143).

13

Methods: Both groups received usual care, and patients in the intervention group also

14

performed simple supervised exercises (walking and rising from a chair, for a total daily

15

duration of ~20 min). We measured incident HAD at discharge and after 3 months

16

(primary outcome); and Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), ambulatory

17

capacity, number of falls, re-hospitalisation and death during a 3-month follow-up

18

(secondary outcomes).

19

Results: Median duration of hospitalisation was 7 days (interquartile range 4 days).

20

Compared with admission, the intervention group had a lower risk of HAD at discharge

21

(odds ratio [OR]: 0.32; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.11–0.92) and at 3-months follow-

22

up (OR 0.24; 95% CI: 0.08–0.74) than controls during follow-up. No intervention effect

23

was noted for the other secondary endpoints (all p>0.05), although a trend towards a lower

24

mortality risk was observed in the intervention group (p=0.078).

INTRODUCTION

31

Hospitalisation-associated disability (HAD, i.e., loss of the ability to perform one or more

32

basic activities of daily living [ADL] independently at discharge) occurs in more than

33

one-third of hospitalised older adults.1–4 This condition is associated with long-term

34

disability, institutionalisation and death,5–7 and therefore its prevention should be a

35

priority.

36

Hospitalised older patients spend most of the time in bed even if they are able to walk

37

independently,8 and the majority (73%) do not walk at all during hospitalisation.9 Several

38

physical strategies can be applied to prevent the functional decline associated with periods

39

of restricted mobility such as those imposed by hospitalisation, but physical exercise

40

appears the most effective.10 Exercise interventions have proven feasible and safe in

41

acutely hospitalised older medical patients, and are effective to improve their functional

42

status at discharge as well as to reduce the length and cost of hospital stays.11–13 It has

43

been recommended that hospitalised old people should perform multicomponent exercise

44

programmes, that is, combining walking and resistance exercises.11 However, this type of

45

intervention usually involves complex exercises and requires the purchase of weight-

46

training equipment, which might hinder its routine implementation in some Acute Care

47

of Elderly (ACE) units.

48

The aim of this study was to determine the effects of an inpatient exercise programme

49

including simple physical exercises for patients admitted to an ACE unit on: incident

50

HAD at discharge and at 3-months post-discharge (primary endpoint); and performance

51

on the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), independent-walking ability

52

(functional ambulatory classification [FAC]), and number of falls, re-hospitalisation and

53

mortality risk during the 3 months following discharge (secondary endpoints).

METHODS

55

Study design

56

This clinical trial (NCT01374893) complied with the recommendations of the

57

Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement.14 Patients (>75

58

years) admitted to our ACE unit (Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón,

59

Madrid) from June 2012 to June 2014 were considered eligible to participate in the study.

60

During these two years, the patients were eligible to be included in the control or

61

intervention group in a time-dependent manner (i.e., using 4- or 8-week blocks), to avoid

62

the co-presence of patients from both groups in the unit, such that the patients were

63

blinded to actual group assignment. We then excluded those who were non-ambulatory

64

or dependent in all basic ADL at baseline (i.e., 2 weeks before admission, assessed by

65

retrospective interview), had unstable cardiovascular disease or any other major medical

66

condition contraindicating exercise, terminal illness, severe dementia, an expected length

67

of hospitalisation <3 days, were transferred from another hospital unit, or had a scheduled

68

admission (which was usually associated with a length of hospitalisation <3 days). Only

69

those hospitalised for 3 or more days and alive at discharge were included. The

70

Institutional Review Board approved the protocol, and written informed consent was

71

obtained from patients. When it was not possible to obtain the informed consent directly

72

from a patient due to medical reasons (e.g., impaired cognitive function), proxy consent

73

was obtained from their relatives. All procedures were performed in accordance with the

74

ethical standards laid down in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.

75

Both groups received standard care in our ACE unit.15

76

Intervention

77

The intervention (Monday to Friday) consisted solely of rising from a seated to an upright

78

position (using armrests/assistance if necessary) and supervised walking exercises (a

79

representative example of the exercises performed is available as Supplementary

80

Material). For the former, exercise loads increased individually and progressively from

81

1 to 3 sets of up to 10 repetitions, with a 2-minute rest between sets. When patients could

82

complete the prescribed training session (e.g., 1 set of 10 repetitions) in two consecutive

83

days, a new set was added, up to a maximum of 3 sets of 10 repetitions per session.

84

Walking total time progressed from 3 to 10 minutes (with resting periods if needed,

85

depending on the patient’s condition) along the corridor of the ward with/without

86

assistance. Standing and walking exercises were separated by a rest period of up to 5

87

minutes. All the exercise sessions were supervised by a fitness specialist (NBA or GRR),

88

and training loads were recorded in a notebook.

89

Endpoints

90

The research staff included nurses, medical residents and the aforementioned fitness

91

specialists who were in charge of supervising each session. Those involved in outcome

92

assessment were not involved in supervising the intervention. However, assessors and

93

care providers were not blinded to the assigned intervention. The ability to perform basic

94

ADL, the SPPB,16 and the modified FAC17 were assessed in-hospital on admission and

95

on discharge. Basic ADLs and FAC were also assessed retrospectively to analyse baseline

96

status, as well as by telephone interview 3-months post-discharge. HAD was considered

97

as a dichotomous variable attending to whether the patient had lost or not the ability to

98

perform one or more ADL independently, and was assessed at discharge and 3 months

99

later.1 The basic ADL included for HAD assessment were bathing, dressing, toileting,

100

transferring, continence and eating.18 We also assessed the loss of independent ambulation

101

at discharge and three months later. This was determined according to the modified FAC,

102

which classifies patients in five different categories attending to their level of dependence

103

during walking: a score of 0 was assigned if the patient could not walk, 1 if the patient

104

required continuous manual contact to support the body, 2 for light or intermittent manual

105

contact to assist balance, 3 for independent but supervised ambulation, and 4 for

106

independent ambulation on level surfaces or stairs.17 Thus, a FAC score <4 was

107

considered the threshold for independent ambulation.17 Mortality and number of falls

108

during post-discharge follow-up were recorded by telephone interview.

109

Although the original protocol specified a change in SPPB score as the primary

110

endpoint,14 an interim analysis after 4 months revealed that 94% (intervention) and 84%

111

(controls) of patients had an SPPB score <6 on a 0–12 scale, masking a potential

112

intervention effect. Accordingly, we considered that the intervention effects would not be

113

noticeable in a test such as the SPPB given the very low physical performance capacity

114

of the study participants, whereas ability to perform basic ADL might be more responsive

115

to the intervention in this patient group. Thus, HAD was established as the primary

116

endpoint.

117

Statistical analysis

118

Prior (unpublished) data obtained in 604 patients showed that 33% of the patients

119

admitted to our ACE unit improved in one or more ADL from admission to discharge. As

120

we hoped to increase this rate by 15% with the intervention (up to 48%), we estimated a

121

sample of 260 or more patients to detect a significant intervention effect on incident HAD

122

(power=80%, =0.05).

123

Data are presented as mean±standard deviation (SD). Normal distribution (Shapiro-Wilk

124

test) and homoscedasticity (Levene’s test) of the data were checked before any statistical

125

treatment. Groups were compared using Student’s independent or chi-square tests for

126

continuous or dichotomous variables, respectively. Binary logistic regression was used to

127

compare the risk of HAD, frailty (SPPB score <9), independent ambulation, re-

128

hospitalisation and death between groups. Survival analysis (crude and adjusted Kaplan-

129

Meier) was performed during the 3-month follow-up. Incidence rate ratio (IRR,

130

calculated with negative binomial regression) was used to compare the number of falls

131

between groups. We did not impute missing data, and thus only available data was used

132

for analysis for each specific variable. All statistical analyses were conducted using a

133

statistical software package (SPSS 23.0, IBM, NY) with =0.05.

134

RESULTS

135

A flow diagram of study participants is shown in figure 1. From a total of 1110 patients

136

admitted to our ACE unit during the study period, 281 met all inclusion criteria and

137

volunteered to participate. Of these, 131 and 150 were assigned to the control and the

138

intervention group, respectively. Finally, 268 patients (n=143 and 125 for intervention

139

and control, respectively) completed the study and could be included in the analysis. No

140

between-group differences were found at the start of the study for most

141

sociodemographic/clinical variables, but those in the intervention arm were overall more

142

dependent in ADL function, both at baseline (i.e., 2 weeks before admission, assessed by

143

retrospective interview) and admission (Table 1). The median length of hospitalisation

144

was 7 days (interquartile range [IQR] 4), with no between-group differences (p=0.246).

145

Median duration of the exercise intervention was 3 days (IQR 2), with an average total

146

exercise time per day of ~20 min (the median duration of the walking part was 5 min

147

[IQR 4, range 0 to 10] and patients performed a mean of 9 [SD 6, range 0 to 30] sit to

148

stands). No adverse effects or falls were recorded during the intervention. Five (3.5%)

149

patients did not exercise because they had a rapid, severe functional decline shortly after

150

admission.

151

Compared with admission, patients in the exercise group had a significantly lower risk of

152

HAD than their controls both at discharge and at 3-months post-discharge, even when

153

adjusting for clinical characteristics and functional performance at admission (Table 2),

154

with the proportion of patients diagnosed with HAD significantly lower in the former at

155

both time points (p=0.012 and 0.003 for discharge and 3-month post-discharge,

156

respectively). Compared with baseline, however, the proportion of patients with HAD did

157

not differ between groups at discharge (56% and 58% for the intervention and control

158

group, respectively; p=0.685) or 3 months later (53% and 62%, respectively; p=0.188).

159

Also, no intervention effect was noted at discharge for the SPPB (3.6±2.5 and 4.2±3.1 for

160

the intervention and control group, respectively; p=0.108) and FAC score (2.8±1.2 and

161

2.9±1.3, respectively; p=0.404), or for risk of re-hospitalisation or number of falls during

162

the 3-month follow-up (0.44±1.47 [median: 0, range: 0, 10] and 0.70±1.70 [median: 0,

163

range: 0, 10]) (Table 2). A non-significant trend towards a lower mortality risk was

164

observed in the intervention group, with crude and adjusted Kaplan-Meier analysis

165

confirming this trend (p=0.084 and 0.085, respectively) (figure 2).

166

DISCUSSION

167

HAD is a frequent condition among hospitalised older adults that has major negative

168

consequences for patients and caregivers.1 Our finding that performing simple inpatient

169

exercises (solely walking and rising from a chair) considerably decreases (by ~70%) the

170

risk of HAD in acutely hospitalised patients of advanced age (mean of 88 years), the

171

majority also being frail, is thus important. Accordingly, our results support the routine

172

implementation of these exercises during the acute hospitalisation of older patients.

173

Results of different systematic reviews indicate that inpatient exercise programmes are

174

safe and overall effective in hospitalised older patients.11–13 However, not all types of

175

exercise interventions are easily feasible in this population owing to a frequently limited

176

mobility capacity. Walking during hospital stay has proven to maintain pre-

177

hospitalisation mobility, but conflicting results have been reported regarding its benefits

178

on ADL function.19,20 By contrast, the combination of walking with lower limb

179

strengthening exercises can provide greater benefits on functional ability.21,22 Indeed,

180

walking combined with stretching/strengthening exercises (e.g., leg lifts/swings, toe/heel

181

raises) is associated with a better ADL function at 1-month post-discharge.21 A recent

182

study reported that a combination of walking, balance, and resistance exercises during a

183

median of 5 days provided significant benefits in the functional ability of older patients

184

during acute hospitalisation.22 But, the aforementioned intervention was more complex

185

than the present protocol and required specific weight-training equipment,22 which might

186

hinder routine implementation in some ACE units.

187

Although sedentary behaviours (such as those commonly observed in hospitalised

188

patients 8) are associated with an increased incidence of frailty in older adults, the

189

inclusion of a low amount of physical activity moderates (or even completely offsets if

190

performed for >27 minutes) this relationship,23 which reinforces the need of increasing

191

physical activity levels regardless of the specific exercise performed. In further support

192

of the effectiveness of simple exercises against sedentary behaviours and the consequent

193

functional decline, Harvey et al. recently reported that encouraging frequent but small

194

bouts of exercise (i.e., rising from a chair) might suffice to reduce functional decline in

195

frail sheltered housing residents.24 It is reasonable to hypothesise that, as in healthy older

196

adults, a dose-response relationship likely exists between training intensity and exercise

197

benefits.25 However, our results suggest that walking for up to 10 minutes and standing

198

up from a chair (gradually increasing exercise loads by increasing the total number of

199

repetitions [until a maximum of 30/day] and providing external help during the movement

200

if needed) might induce clinically meaningful benefits in the case of frail older patients

201

such as those studied here. That said, this type of intervention requires close supervision

202

and thus an additional time involvement of the hospital staff with respect to their daily

203

duties or reliance on external staff, as described here (i.e., fitness specialists).

204

Several potential limitations should be considered. Groups initially differed in functional

205

and mental status as well as in falls history, which might have potentially biased the

206

outcomes. In this respect, however, the benefits of the intervention on the risk of incident

207

HAD remained significant even after adjusting for clinical and functional variables at

208

admission. The losses during the follow-up (up to ~20% of participants for some

209

endpoints such as FAC) should also be borne in mind as a limitation. Also, our study is a

210

single-centre study performed in a very old and frail population, which could limit the

211

generalisability of our findings to younger or more functional patients. The small

212

proportion (~25%) of the total number of hospitalised patients in our ACE unit that

213

participated in our study possibly (partly due to the strict inclusion criteria) lends further

214

support to the idea that the present results might not be necessarily applicable to acutely

215

hospitalised old patients in general. On the other hand, although this intervention did not

216

require investment in weight-training equipment, the additional time commitment needed

217

from the hospital staff to supervise the exercise sessions (or alternatively the need to rely

218

on external staff such as fitness specialists, as we did here) are issues that should be

219

addressed in future research, for instance in studies aiming to assess the cost effectiveness

220

of the present type of intervention. It must also be noted that no intervention benefits were

221

observed when HAD was analysed with respect to baseline (i.e., 2 weeks before

222

admission). Finally, the greater functional independence of the control group at baseline

223

could have potentially influenced the results, as the patients of this group might have

224

tended to more rapidly recover their “normal” physical status during hospitalisation even

225

in the absence of an exercise intervention.

226

CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS

227

A simple inpatient exercise programme solely consisting of walking and rising from a

228

chair (median duration of the intervention only 3 days, ~20 minutes/day) decreases the

229

incidence of HAD in acutely hospitalised, very old patients. Further research is needed to

230

analyse the cost-effectiveness of this type of intervention (in terms of staff resources) and

231

its generalisability. However, given the clinical relevance of HAD, our results support the

232

routine implementation of these exercises during the acute hospitalisation of older

233

patients.
