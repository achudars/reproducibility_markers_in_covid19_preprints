Abstract:

33

Purpose:

34

The use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies to augment patient care, enables providers to

35

communicate remotely with patients enhancing the quality of care and patient engagement. Few

36

studies addressed barriers to its implementation, especially in medically underserved populations.

37

Methods:

38

A cross-sectional study of 151 cancer patients was conducted at an academic medical center in the

39

United States. A trained interviewer performed structured interviews regarding the barriers and

40

facilitators of patients’ current and desired utilization of technology for healthcare services.

41

Results:

42

Of the 151 participants, 35.8% were male and ages ranged from 21-104 years. Only 73.5% of

43

participants currently have daily access to internet, and 68.2% currently own a smartphone capable

44

of displaying mobile applications. Among all participants, utilization of a daily mHealth application

45

was significantly higher in patients with a college-level degree (OR; 2.78, p<0.01) and lower in older

46

patients (OR; 0.05, p<0.01). Differences in utilization when adjusted for current smartphone use and

47

daily access to internet were nonsignificant. Among smartphone users, the desire to increase cancer

48

knowledge was associated with a higher likelihood of utilizing a mHealth application (OR; 261.53,

49

p<0.01).

50

Conclusion:

51

The study suggests the access to mobile technology is the predominant determinant of utilization.

52

Healthcare organizations should consider these factors when launching patient engagement platforms.

1. Introduction
As mortality rates continue to decrease among cancer patients in the United States, health care

57

systems are faced with a growing population with complex medical, psychological, and social needs

58

(1). This has caused comprehensive care that extends years beyond treatment initiation. However,

59

lapses in care continue to persist and much progress is needed to improve quality among cancer

60

survivors (2). Mobile health (mHealth) technology has served as a tool that can potentially address

61

these needs and encourage active participation among patients in a variety of care settings including

62

cancer-related care (3–5).

63

The integration of mobile health (mHealth) applications in cancer care have been widely

64

discussed and proposed roles include augmenting clinical processes, managing chemotherapy-

65

related side effects, and supporting drug adherence (6,7). The current role of mHealth in oncology

66

has been limited to self-management, and the quality of cancer-related mobile applications varies

67

drastically (8,9). A recent study found that while the acceptance of mHealth technology was high

68

among cancer patients, adoption of such technology is low. Factors predictive of the use of mHealth

69

in this population included rural residency and a new diagnosis of cancer, indicating that geography

70

and education are driving motivators for mHealth utilization (10).

71

Mobile health has also been proposed as a potential tool to reduce health disparities among

72

underserved populations through improved health literacy, medication adherence, and clinical

73

outcomes (11). Low health literacy has been associated with several poor health outcomes and

74

partially explains the racial and socioeconomic disparities in care (12,13). While the data regarding

75

the efficacy of implementing mHealth initiatives are low quality and scarce, the current data that

76

exists is promising (5,8). A recent meta-analysis of mHealth-based interventions among breast

77

cancer patients found that interventions consistently improved quality-of-life measures among these

78

patients, albeit the data on the psychological effect of these interventions is less conclusive (14).

79

However, another meta-analysis reported in pain, fatigue, and other psychological outcomes among

80

cancer survivors utilizing mHealth-based interventions (15). This suggests that the data on the

81

efficacy of mHealth on both cancer survivorship and those undergoing treatment is still an emerging

82

and exciting area of research.

83

This purpose of this study was to investigate factors associated with a willingness to utilize a

84

mHealth application for general health maintenance among a cohort of cancer patients at an

85

academic medical center that services a very socioeconomically diverse and medically under-served

86

population. This study was initially launched as a quality improvement project seeking new patient

87

engagement platforms. We hypothesized that while the acceptability of a mHealth application for

88

cancer-related health information will be quite high, it will be limited by education-related factors

89

and current technology use patterns. Specifically, we believe that (1) patients without current daily

90

internet will be less accepting of a mHealth application and (2) patients that currently lack a

91

smartphone will be less accepting of a mHealth application than their counterparts with this

92

technology.

93

2. Materials and Methods

94

2.1 Study Design and Participants

95

This is a cross-sectional study of cancer patients attending the outpatient clinic and infusion

96

center at an academic medical center in Philadelphia. The target population was adults with

97

Inclusion criteria consisted of (1) age greater than 18 years, (2) diagnosis of malignancy, and (3)

98

willingness to participate. Before administration, the survey was evaluated by the institutional

99

review board (IRB) at the host institution and was deemed IRB exempt. Data was collected over a

100

1-month period in 2018.

101

2.2. Survey Development

102

This survey was designed by one of the authors (R.P.). The survey consisted of basic

103

demographic information (age, gender, highest education, and marital status) followed by a series of

104

questions regarding access to the internet and mobile technology. Previous use of mHealth

105

applications as well as desired use of mHealth applications was also evaluated. All questions were

106

arranged in yes/no format for simplicity. Also, the participants were asked to answer the questions

107

irrespective of current technology use (i.e. using a mobile application on a smartphone in

108

participants currently without a smartphone).

109

The survey was initially tested among a pilot population of 76 participants and subsequently

110

expanded to a target of 150 participants. The sample size was determined using an a priori power

analysis estimating a 20% mean difference in mHealth acceptability based on educational

112

achievement with a Type I error rate of 0.05% and Type II error rate of 20%. Analysis indicated that

113

99 patients would be required to detect this difference.

114

2.3 Data Collection

115

Eligible participants were approached and given explanations regarding the purpose,

116

significance, and methods of the study. After receiving consent, a trained interviewer performed

117

structured interviews using the survey as a guide. Study data were collected and managed using

118

Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools hosted at the study site (16).

119

2.4 Statistical Analysis

120

The data were analyzed using Statistica® Version 13.0 (TIBCO Software Inc.) and Graphpad®

121

PRISM 6.0 (Graphpad Software Inc.). Demographic variables were characterized by descriptive

122

statistics. Chi-Square test for association was utilized for categorical variables. Statistical

123

significance was defined as p < 0.05 on a two-tailed distribution. Finally, adjusted odds ratios from

124

logistic regression analysis were presented to identify the effects of demographic information and

125

survey answers on a patient’s willingness to utilize an application for monitoring their health

126

condition. Adjusted odds ratio reported as (OR; mean, CI95%, p-value).

127

3. Results

128

A total of 151 participants were approached and all participants consented to the survey (100%

129

response rate). The demographic information of participants is summarized in Table 1. The mean

130

age of participants was 62.3±14.4 years of age and consisted of 35.8% male. Race demographics

131

were not collected after the pilot population was expanded, but the pilot population consisted

132

primarily of minority groups (83.1%). While 60.3% of participants had a high school degree or less,

133

39.7% obtained at least an undergraduate degree with 5.9% of total participants achieved additional

134

education (Table 1).

135

The response distribution of selected survey items is outlined in Table 2. Interestingly, only

136

73.5% of survey respondents have daily access to internet services. Individuals without internet

137

tended to be older (mean age of 71.9±11.2 vs. 58.8±13.9) and less educated (12.5% with a college

138

degree vs. 49.5%) than their counterparts with internet. Similar characteristics were seen in

139

individuals that lacked either a mobile phone or smartphone (Table 2). Among the 106 individuals

140

that currently own a smartphone, 60.4% use phone that operates iOS software (iPhone®) and 39.6%

141

use a phone that operates Android software (Samsung®, LG®, etc.). The frequency of previous,

142

defined as over the past 6 months, mobile access to general health and personal health information

143

was similar (53% and 51.7% respectively). However, 59 participants (39.1% of total) neither

144

accessed general nor personal health information while 66 participants (43.7% of total) utilized both

145

forms of health technology (Table 2).

146

Future-oriented survey items (items 12 through 16) evaluated different aspects of integrating

147

mHealth technology into practice and were met with modest support overall. However, acceptance

148

was significantly different based on current technology utilization. Among individuals without

149

access to the internet, the mean acceptance rate of future-oriented items was 7.5%. This pattern was

150

also demonstrated in individuals lacking a mobile phone (4.2%) and smartphone (2.3%) (data not

151

shown).

152

Regarding demographic factors influencing the willingness to utilize a mobile application for

153

daily health monitoring, acceptance was significantly associated with both age and educational

154

achievement (table 3). Willingness to utilize a mHealth application was highest in individuals <50

155

years of age (83.3% favorable) and lowest in individuals >80 years of age (82.4% unfavorable).

156

Logistic regression revealed that age groups 61-70 (OR; 0.24, 0.07-0.90, p<0.01), 71-80 (OR; 0.05,

157

0.01-0.23, p<0.01), and >80 years (OR; 0.04, 0.01-0.22, p<0.01) were significantly less likely to

158

utilize a daily mHealth application than individuals <50 years (Figure 1A). 71.7% of individuals with

159

at least a college degree were favorable of a mHealth application compared to 41.8% of individuals

160

without a college education (OR; 2.78,1.25-5.88, p<0.01) (Table 3 & Figure 1A). No significant

161

differences in race, gender, or marital status were identified. However, differences among age groups

162

and education were eliminated when adjusting for current smartphone use (Figure 1B).

166

Reference group for education, gender, and age was high school or less, male, and <50 years

167

respectively.

168

A desire to increase cancer-related knowledge was associated with an increased odds of

169

utilizing a daily mHealth application (OR; 261.5, 10.13 – 6748.71, p<0.01). Interestingly, no other

170

features of a mobile application exhibited signficant associations despite being similar in nature

171

(Figure 2B). Evaluation of the frequency of each response revealed that of the 81 participants that

172

were willing to use a daily mobile application, 80 (98.8% ) also desired an application to increase

173

cancer-related knowledge. Conversely, of the 70 individuals not willing to utilize a daily

174

application, 63 (90.0%) also did not desire an application to increase their cancer-related knowledge

175

(data not shown).

4. Discussion

181

This study aimed to investigate the factors associated with the willingness to utilize a mHealth

182

application among a population of cancer patients in a socioeconomically diverse and medically

183

underserved community. Our study revealed that while the acceptability of mHealth technology was

184

hindered by age and education-related barriers among all participants, these factors were eliminated

185

when evaluating current smartphone users and those with daily access to internet. This suggests that

186

past technology use is highly indicative of adoption of future technology such as a daily mobile

187

application for cancer-related health. These findings also indicate that access to technology

188

facilitates health-promotion activities among a predominate minority and socioeconomically diverse

189

population.

190

Several studies have identified gaps in internet access along sociodemographic boundaries such

191

that individuals with lower income, lower education, and identify as a racial minority are less likely

192

to have access to internet services (17,18). These findings, coupled with the abundant literature

193

linking the prevalence of inadequate health literacy and poor clinical outcomes among African-

194

Americans, further highlight the need for mHealth applications among minority populations in the

195

United States (11,12,19).

196

Our study both confirms and expands upon the previous literature. Previous literature has

197

reported both high acceptability and positive outcome measures among cancer patients utilizing

198

mHealth-based interventions (9,10,14,20). However, our study has investigated both the

199

acceptability and feasibility of mHealth-based interventions among a population of predominately

200

racial minorities and of lower socioeconomic status. While our study reported an overall acceptance

201

of a mHealth application for health information among cancer patients, we found that our

202

population faces technology-related barriers at a higher prevalence than the rest of the United States.

203

The rate of daily internet access among our patient (73.5%) is much lower than a recent Pew

204

Research estimate of 90% (21). Our population also had a much lower rate of both a mobile phone

205

(84.1%) and smartphone ownership (68.2%) than a recent national estimate of 96% and 81%

206

respectively (22). This highlights a concern regarding implementation of smartphone-based patient

207

engagement platforms because a large percentage of patients would be excluded from participation.

208

Considering the existence of many cheap smartphones within the United States, future studies

209

should investigate both monetary and non-monetary factors related to smartphone adoption among

210

low-income communities.

211

We found that the desire to increase cancer knowledge was significantly associated with an

212

increased likelihood of utilizing a daily mHealth application for cancer-related information among

213

current smartphone users. Interestingly, we found that past mHealth-related use patterns (accessing

214

personal or general health information on a smartphone) was not associated with the willingness to

215

utilize a daily mHealth application. This suggests that although current smartphone users may not

216

have accessed personal or general health information in the past, future mHealth applications that

217

integrate cancer education with patient health information shows promise in terms of patient

218

acceptance. This offers an exciting avenue for future patient engagement initiatives.

219

There are several limitations in this study. This study investigated only a small subset of

220

patients within a population of predominately low socioeconomic status, so the results are likely not

221

generalizable to the overall population. While a post hoc power analysis indicated that our study

222

was adequately powered to detect the observed differences, there is always the possibility of

223

detecting a difference that is not present in the overall population given our sample size. Our study

224

also only evaluated the willingness of a theoretical mobile application, therefore further research is

225

required to develop and test a mobile application within this population.

226

5. Conclusions

227

The potential use of mHealth-based interventions in a socioeconomically diverse population

228

offers several barriers and opportunities. The relatively lower rates of daily internet access and

229

smartphone use in a low-income patient population appear to be the largest barrier to mHealth

230

acceptance, while education and age-related barriers are eliminated when adjusting for current

231

smartphone use. The desire to increase cancer knowledge was significantly associated with an
