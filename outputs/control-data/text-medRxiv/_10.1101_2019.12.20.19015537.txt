Bone Changes in Early Inflammatory Arthritis
1

ABSTRACT

2

Objectives: We sought to determine the sensitivity of high resolution peripheral

3

quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) to detect change and identify erosions in

4

comparison with conventional radiography (CR) in early inflammatory arthritis patients.

5

We also explored which prognostic factors contribute to bone damage assessed by HR-

6

pQCT in the first year of diagnosis.

7

Methods: 46 patients with arthritic symptoms less than one year, and a clinical diagnosis

8

of inflammatory arthritis were prospectively imaged at baseline and 12-months. HR-

9

pQCT scans of the 2nd and 3rd MCP joints and CR of the hands and feet were performed.

10

Joint space width (JSW), total bone mineral density (Tt.BMD), erosion presence and

11

volume were assessed with HR-pQCT. Scan-rescan precision was assessed to define an

12

individual-level least significant change (LSC) criterion. Regression analyses explored

13

prognostic factors for bone damage progression.

14

Results: We observed no significant group-level changes in JSW, Tt.BMD or erosion

15

volume. 20% or fewer joints demonstrated individual-level changes greater than the LSC

16

criterion for mean JSW, Tt.BMD and erosion volume. HR-pQCT detected more erosions

17

than CR in the 2nd and 3rd MCP. Increased symptom duration at diagnosis was associated

18

(p < 0.10) with lower JSW minimum and higher JSW standard deviation.

19

Conclusions: We have demonstrated stability in erosion, bone density and JSW over 12-

20

months in most patients receiving treatment for inflammatory arthritis using a LSC

21

criterion, although patients with longer symptom duration prior to treatment initiation

22

had demonstrable negative effects on JSW estimates. HR-pQCT captures bone damage

23

and progression undetectable by CR in the imaged joints.

Bone Changes in Early Inflammatory Arthritis
1
2

INTRODUCTION
Early diagnosis and tight monitoring of disease progression are important clinical

3

targets in patients with inflammatory arthritis to optimize treatment response and

4

prevent future damage.[1-3] Conventional radiographs (CR) are traditionally used to

5

assess erosive disease and joint space loss, however may not be sufficiently sensitive to

6

detect changes early in the disease course.

7

High-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT) is a

8

highly sensitive bone imaging tool, capable of capturing 3D volumetric bone images at

9

61 or 82 µm nominal isotropic resolution.[4,5] Quantitative measurement techniques

10

have been developed and validated to assess metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint space

11

width, erosion number and size as well as periarticular bone density and

12

microarchitecture.[6-9] We previously found that HR-pQCT-assessed joint space width

13

outcomes are associated with van der Heijde-modified total Sharp scores (vdHSS) from

14

conventional radiography in patients with advanced disease.[10] These studies provide

15

a strong rationale to investigate the use of HR-pQCT in early inflammatory arthritis

16

patients. The initial disease course in RA is highly heterogenous;[11] predicting who

17

may benefit from aggressive therapy is important to reduce medical risk and cost, as

18

well as preserve function and productivity.[12] While HR-pQCT has been used to

19

demonstrate repair effects at the group level,[13-16] to our knowledge, whether there is

20

utility in monitoring progression with HR-pQCT in the early course of inflammatory

21

arthritis has not been determined. Further, whether established risk factors for

22

aggressive disease, including seropositivity, number of swollen joints and radiographic

23

evidence of erosions [17-20] are also associated with progression of outcomes

24

measured by HR-pQCT is not known.

Bone Changes in Early Inflammatory Arthritis

The purposes of this study were two-fold. First, we sought to demonstrate the

2

relative ability of HR-pQCT to identify erosions in comparison with CR. Second, we

3

explored which factors typically associated with aggressive RA, were associated with

4

baseline bone damage and progression assessed by HR-pQCT, in patients with a recent

5

(< 1 month) diagnosis of early inflammatory arthritis.

METHODS

2

Patients

3

We recruited 46 patients with early inflammatory arthritis (EIA) from the University of

4

Calgary Division of Rheumatology specialty EIA clinic between 2011 and 2014. Eligible

5

patients had experienced inflammatory arthritis symptoms for less than one year, had a

6

clinical diagnosis of early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or undifferentiated arthritis by a

7

rheumatologist, and were beginning disease-modifying therapy according to standard

8

clinical practice. All patients provided written informed consent prior to study

9

participation. Approval for all procedures was obtained by the Conjoint Health Research

10

Ethics Board at the University of Calgary (REB 15-0582). Study visits were conducted at

11

baseline and 12-months. Patients were not involved in the design, conduct, reporting, or

12

dissemination plans of our research.

13
14

Demographic and Clinical Outcomes

15

Demographic information (age, sex, BMI, handedness, occupation, dates of symptom

16

onset and diagnosis) were recorded. Patients were classified according to the 2010

17

ACR/EULAR Classification for RA [21]. Laboratory diagnostics comprised rheumatoid

18

factor (RF), anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody (ACPA), C-reactive protein (CRP)

19

and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Disease activity assessment included tender

20

and swollen joint counts, physician and patient global scores, duration of morning

21

stiffness, Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) scores [22] and 28-joint Disease

22

Activity Score (DAS28).[23] Remission status (DAS28 < 2.6)[24] was also recorded as

23

well as treatments received.

Conventional Radiographs

2

Routine conventional plain film radiographs of the hands, wrist and feet were

3

performed. All CR were scored for erosions, joint space narrowing (JSN) and

4

subluxation using the vdHSS by a single experienced reader from Imaging

5

Rheumatology International (Meersan, Netherlands), blinded to all other patient

6

data.[25] Radiographic progression was defined as a single unit increase in vdHSS

7

score.[26]

HR-pQCT Image Acquisition

10

HR-pQCT scans were performed on the dominant 2nd and 3rd MCP joints secured in a

11

custom positioning device (XtremeCT, Scanco Medical, Brüttisellen, Switzerland).[27]

12

We obtained a scout view (coronal plane x-ray ) to identify the reference line. HR-pQCT

13

scans are acquired in 110 slice increments (“stacks”). For the first 13 baseline scans, the

14

reference line was placed at the distal surface of the 3rd proximal phalangeal bone

15

covering 9 mm distal and 9 mm proximal to the line for a total of 1.8 mm (2 stacks = 220

16

slices). For the remaining patients, to comply with the Study grouP for eXtreme

17

Computed Tomography in Rheumatoid Arthritis (SPECTRA) recommendations for

18

standard positioning which were agreed to shortly after study initiation [28] and to

19

ensure the joint space was captured by a single acquisition, the reference line was

20

placed on the distal surface of the 2nd or 3rd metacarpal, whichever was more distal, and

21

the scan region of interest included 9.02 mm distal and 18.04 mm proximal to the line

22

for a total of 2.7 cm (3 stacks or 330 slices). Images with a nominal isotropic resolution

HR-pQCT Image Processing

5

HR-pQCT image processing details are provided in Appendix 1. Briefly, we assessed

6

total bone mineral density (Tt.BMD, mg/cm3) from grey-scale images. Volumetric joint

7

space was quantified using an algorithm developed by consensus from the SPECTRA

8

collaboration.[29] 3D JSW including mean (JSW.Mean, mm), maximum (JSW.Max, mm),

9

minimum (JSW.Min, mm), standard deviation (JSW.SD, mm), asymmetry (defined as

10

JSW.Asymm = ratio of JSW.Max/JSW.Min, [1]) as well as volume (JSV, mm3) were

11

calculated. Erosion presence was identified by a rheumatologist with extensive HR-

12

pQCT expertise (SF). Semi-automated assessment of erosion volume was performed

13

using the Medical Image Analysis Framework (University of Erlangen, Erlangen

14

Germany).[9]

15
16

Precision Analyses

17

Short-term in vivo precision data were obtained by performing a second scan on the

18

same day with repositioning.[30] In addition, intra-operator precision was assessed for

19

the erosion analysis. Precision of JSW outcomes was previously reported in this cohort.

20

[29] Here precision of erosion volume and Tt.BMD are reported.

22

Statistical Analyses

23

For all demographic, clinical and HR-pQCT outcomes, results are reported as mean and

24

standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise indicated. For HR-pQCT precision, we

25

calculated the precision error as the root-mean square standard deviation (RMSSD) and

the root-mean square coefficient of variation (RMSCV).[31] For erosion volume,

2

precision was calculated separately for erosions less than 10 mm3 and erosions greater

3

than 10 mm3 for comparison with previously published values.[9] In addition, the

4

distribution of the difference between scan-rescan values were compared to determine

5

whether they met the criteria required to compute the least-significant change (LSC) at

6

the 95% confidence level (i.e., 2.77 x RMSSD).[32]

7

Paired Welch’s t-tests were used to examine changes over time at the group level,

8

and tested against an alpha level of 0.05. For paired differences that were not normally

9

distributed, a paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used. Beeswarm plots were used to

10

examine the heterogeneity of the data.[33] To determine whether an individual change

11

exceeded measurement error at a 95% confidence level, the changes in mean JSW, JSV,

12

TtBMD and erosion volume were evaluated against the LSC, as described above.[32]

13

Using the LSC criteria, patients were classified into one of three groups for each

14

outcome measure: improvement, stable, or progression. Based on these criteria, Fisher’s

15

exact test was used to determine whether patients with a diagnosis of RA differed from

16

those with self-limited or undifferentiated arthritis, as well to compare patients with

17

and without: high disease activity at baseline (DAS28 > 5.1),[34] progression to biologic

18

therapy, and remission (DAS28 < 2.6) [24] at follow-up.

19

To understand whether HR-pQCT outcomes are associated with known prognostic

20

factors and disease activity markers, we performed exploratory analyses using simple

21

linear regressions to examine the relationship between prognostic factors and joint

22

space, erosion volume and bone density. Regressions were performed for the 2nd and 3rd

23

MCPs independently and tested against an alpha value of 0.1 due to the exploratory

24

nature of the analyses. Linear regression relationships with an adjusted r-squared

25

greater than zero and statistical significance across both joints were investigated

further. Similarly, binomial logistic regression was used to evaluate the relationship

2

between prognostic factors and erosion presence and tested against an alpha value of

3

0.1. These analyses were performed for both baseline HR-pQCT outcomes and change in

HR-pQCT outcomes. All statistical analyses were performed using R (v3.5.3), RStudio

(v1.1.463)[35] and RMarkdown.[36,37]

RESULTS

2

Demographics and Clinical Characteristics

3

Of the 46 patients recruited, one withdrew from the study prior to follow-up and two

4

were lost to follow-up. Table 1 shows characteristics of the 43 patients who attended

5

both study visits. At baseline, 33 (77%) patients met the 2010 American College of

6

Rheumatology criteria for RA [21] and 10 (23%) were thus assessed to have

7

undifferentiated arthritis. At 12-month follow-up, several patients were reclassified,

8

resulting in a final distribution of 37 (86%) with RA, 2 (5%) still being assessed as

9

having undifferentiated arthritis, 1 (2%) with Adult Onset Still’s, 1 (2%) with psoriatic

10

arthritis, and 2 (5%) with self-limited arthritis. At baseline, 4 (10%) of patients had

11

been exposed to a conventional disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (cDMARD),

12

while 38 (88%) utilized a cDMARD over the 12-month follow-up. Eleven (26%) of

13

patients progressed to requiring a biologic DMARD (bDMARD) over the 12-month

14

follow-up. 38 (97%) of patients had active disease (DAS28 > 2.6) at baseline, while 13

15

(35%) had active disease at follow-up, with mean reductions in the tender and swollen

16

joint counts over one year (Table 1).

17
18

Precision

19

Seventeen joints from 13 patients were used for precision analysis as they had at least

20

one erosion, as well as two scans without motion artifacts acquired on the same day.

21

Intra-rater precision of erosion volume determined as RMSSD was 1.89 mm3 for total

22

erosion volume per joint, and 2.52 mm3 when evaluating by individual erosion volume.

23

RMSSD for erosions > 10 mm3 was 3.49 mm3 and for erosions < 10 mm3 was 1.25 mm3

24

(Table 2).

Analysis of scan-rescan precision revealed smaller precision errors; RMSSD was

2

0.72 mm3 for total erosion volume per joint and 1.04 mm3 when evaluating by

3

individual erosion volume. RMSSD for erosions > 10 mm3 was 1.72 mm3 and for

4

erosions < 10 mm3 was 0.63 mm3 (Table 2). RMSSD for Tt.BMD was 11 mgHA/cm3. LSC

Volume

10

For quantitative analyses, 4 joints were excluded from baseline JSW, Tt.BMD and

11

erosion volume analysis due to motion artifact or segmentation errors. Males had

12

greater JSV (52 mm3 in 2nd MCP), mean JSW (0.3 mm in 2nd MCP) and max JSW (0.1 mm

13

in 2nd MCP) than females in both 2nd and 3rd MCPs at baseline (p < 0.005, adjusted R2

14

varying from 0.19 to 0.69). Increased symptom duration at diagnosis was significantly

15

associated (p < 0.10) with lower minimum JSW (adjusted R2 = 0.12 and 0.05) suggesting

16

that for every 100 days of symptoms, there is a 0.01 mm decrease in minimum JSW.

17

Similarly, symptom duration was associated with increased SD of JSW (adjusted R2 =

18

0.06 and 0.24) for 2nd and 3rd MCPs at baseline, suggesting that for every 100 days of

19

symptoms, there is a 0.002 increase in SD. We found no significant associations between

20

baseline age, duration of time between diagnosis and scan, BMI, seropositivity, HAQ

21

score, patient global score, morning stiffness duration, exposure to steroids, or DAS28

22

score and JSW, Tt.BMD or erosion volume outcomes.

Seventeen (40%) of patients had erosions identified by HR-pQCT in the 2nd or 3rd MCP

2

at baseline. Two individuals (4%) with erosions at the 2nd or 3rd MCP were identified by

3

CR, but HR-pQCT allowed identification of erosions in an additional 16 patients (38%)

4

with HR-pQCT. Although HR-pQCT was more sensitive to identifying erosions at these

5

joints, there were 11 patients (26%) with erosions captured in additional joints by CR

6

included in the vdHSS scoring system (Figure 1). In the participant with the highest

7

vdHSS, HR-pQCT revealed a “pseudoerosion” (i.e., no cortical break) in the 2nd MCP, but

8

no erosions that met the SPECTRA erosion definition in the 2nd or 3rd MCP (Figure 2).

9

Minimum JSW by HR-pQCT was not associated with the vdHSS total JSN score (data

10

not shown). One participant had a non-zero vdHSS JSN score in the 2nd or 3rd MCPs; thus

11

a direct comparison between JSW and vdHSS joint score at these joints could not be

12

made.

Longitudinal Changes in JSW, Tt.BMD, Erosion Number and Erosion Volume by

16

Examination of raw images found two patients who developed erosions by 12-month

17

follow-up. After image registration, the appearance of new erosions was less convincing

18

(Figure 3). The overall number of erosions increased from 28 to 36 between baseline

19

and 12-month follow-up.

20

Five and three additional joints were excluded from JSW and Tt.BMD analyses at

21

follow-up, respectively. There were no significant group-level changes in JSW, Tt.BMD

22

or erosion volume over time at the 2nd or 3rd MCP (p > 0.05, Figure 4, Supplementary

23

Figure 1). At the individual level, most joints did not exceed the LSC. However, four

24

joints had decreased mean JSW and JSV, two had decreased BMD and four an increased

erosion volume. Five joints had increased mean JSW, four had increased JSV, two had

2

increased BMD and 2 had decreased erosion volume (Figure 4, Figure 5).

3

Patients who had a significant change in an HR-pQCT outcome were pooled into

4

groups of improved (n = 7), stable (n = 16) or worsened (n = 9). No patient had both an

5

improvement and worsening. Biologic DMARD-naïve patients were more likely to

6

worsen, while bDMARD-treated patients were more likely to improve (p = 0.02). There

7

was no difference in progress or improvement and disease activities at baseline or

8

follow-up. Further, patients with undifferentiated or self-limited arthritis did not

9

progress or improve differently from those with RA. Based on exploratory linear

10

regression analyses, there were no other significant associations between baseline

11

clinical measures and bone changes that were consistent among both the 2nd and 3rd

MCPs.

Bone Changes in Early Inflammatory Arthritis
1

DISCUSSION

2

In this exploratory study in an EIA-cohort, HR-pQCT identified more erosions than

3

CR in the specific joints examined, and could better characterize mimickers of erosions,

4

such as pseudo-erosions. Despite clinical improvement over 12-months, we observed

5

no group level changes in HR-pQCT-measured JSW, BMD or erosion volume, supporting

6

that stability of disease both clinically and by imaging was common in our cohort.

7

While HR-pQCT is highly sensitive to changes in the joints we examined, the limited

8

coverage presents challenges for full-patient assessment when compared with CR.

9

Based on the few patients (3) who sustained radiographic progression, it is challenging

10

to draw conclusions regarding the ability of HR-pQCT to predict radiographic

11

progression. HR-pQCT is clearly best-suited to assessing erosion volume; the evaluation

12

of the clinical relevance of detecting more erosions and changes in erosion volume in a

13

small number of joints or detecting fewer erosions across a large number of joints will

14

be the subject of future studies.

15

We sought to determine the relevance of pathology detected on HR-pQCT in early

16

inflammatory arthritis. The correlation between minimum JSW and disease duration,

17

while not strong, is consistent with findings of decreased radiographic JSN with disease

18

duration.[38] Biologic DMARD-treated patients were more likely to demonstrate

19

improvement in HR-pQCT outcomes, which is consistent with previous findings

20

demonstrating decreases in erosion volumes under biologic therapies.[13,14,16]

21

However, we did not observe any association with HR-pQCT outcomes and disease

22

activity. The threshold for defining a significant change was based on precision of the

23

outcomes at the 95% confidence level. We explored defining LSC at the 80% confidence

24

level,[39] and although altering this threshold increased the number of patients

25

experiencing a significant change, it did not reveal any additional associations with

disease status. This suggests that determination of minimal clinically important

2

differences for HR-pQCT is still required.

3

Our exploratory analysis found several prognostic factors associated with baseline

4

HR-pQCT outcomes. The larger JSV, mean JSW and max JSW in males suggests that these

5

outcomes are likely correlated with overall joint size. Therefore, sex and joint size may

6

need to be considered in future HR-pQCT studies.

7

Our study has allowed us to demonstrate several technical advances in applying

8

this imaging modality. We examined scan-rescan precision for HR-pQCT erosion and

9

BMD analysis. Overall, the magnitude of the precision errors for erosion analysis, and

10

poorer precision for scan-rescan than intra-rater analyses, reflect that the operator’s

11

judgement is still required to delineate the surface of the erosion. This can be partly

12

explained by using the first segmented image to guide the second analysis for scan-

13

rescan analyses. In contrast, intra-rater analyses were performed without the guide of

14

the previous erosion segmentation, three months apart. The poorer intra-rater

15

precision in this study than previously reported by Töpfer et al. [9] may also have

16

resulted from the time delay between intra-rater analyses, differences in analysis

17

experience, and the larger mean erosion volume in our cohort (15.4 mm3 vs 9.3 mm3).

18

The high RMSCV particularly for small erosions suggest that absolute precision errors

19

should be reported alongside relative precision errors. And finally, with a greater

20

number of erosions available for precision analysis, it would likely be prudent to

21

calculate least-significant change values that are stratified by erosion size.

22

A limitation of the study was that there were a considerable number of

23

observations that had to be discarded due to motion artifacts. Additionally, the

24

discrepancy between new erosion identification from raw images to registered images

suggests that registration of baseline to follow-up HR-pQCT images is critical to

2

investigating subtle changes in erosion presence and volume.

3

In conclusion, HR-pQCT captures bone damage and progression undetectable by CR

4

in the imaged joints. Incorporation of image registration and less operator-dependent

5

erosion analyses will improve the ability to monitor change at the individual level.

6

Future studies of larger early inflammatory arthritis cohorts should investigate the

7

minimal clinically important differences for HR-pQCT-assessed bone damage to

8

determine what levels are associated with disease progression.
