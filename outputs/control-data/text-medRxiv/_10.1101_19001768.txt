ABSTRACT
Background Peer-to-peer teaching, which is an alternative to standard teaching
(by expert instructors), has the potential to emphasize student self-learning and
reduce the cost and workload of the instructor. Self-instruction videos with peer
feedback are highlighted in many medical and nursing school curricula.
Objective To evaluate whether peer to peer instruction supported by a structured
curriculum and video exemplars is not inferior to standard instructor-led teaching
in basic airway management skill, knowledge, and confidence attainment.
Method This single blinded randomized crossover trial was conducted with a
sample of novice nursing students. Data was collected through the pre- to postknowledge and confidence assessments. The students were randomly assigned to
two crossover groups. Each student learned basic airway management skills
through both methods. The students’ performances were recorded in every
session with recordings reviewed by blinded expert instructors.
Results The study included 48 participants, who were assigned into both the
expert instruction group and peer-to-peer group through computer generated
randomization. The skill rating scores of the peer-to-peer group were not inferior
to the standard teaching. With further analysis, we noted that the peer-to-peer
group scores had significantly higher scores demonstrating a large effect size
(Cohen’s

d of 1.07 (p-value 0.002) for oropharyngeal airway insertion, 1.14 (p-

value <0.001) for nasopharyngeal airway insertion and 0.81 (p-value 0.003) for
bag mask ventilation). There was no significant difference between pre- and postknowledge scores across groups (p-value of 0.13 and 0.22 respectively).
Participants in both groups reported higher confidence after learning. However,
the difference was not statistically significant.
Conclusions Undergraduate nursing students trained in basic airway management
skills by peer-to-peer instruction and a structured curriculum did not show
inferior scores compared to the students who were trained by expert instructors.
There was no significant difference in the knowledge and confidence levels
between the groups.

INTRODUCTION
Basic airway management is an essential skill for a wide variety of
healthcare providers. Nowadays, these skills are commonly taught by expert
instructors who lead face-to-face teaching sessions.

1

There are several

disadvantages to this approach, including the cost of obtaining qualified
instructors. Expert instructors may also prolong sessions by providing didactic
information, thus limiting actual practice time. Another limitation of training by
expert is logistical in nature due to the need to schedule training around the often
fixed schedules of these subject matter experts. Structured curricula, including
the use of self-instruction videos, has been shown to be as effective as standard
face-to-face training in certain circumstances such as for teaching basic airway
management, cervical collar application, emergency extremity splinting skills,

2,3

manual cardiac defibrillation, and automated external defibrillator.

In these

situations, trainees have demonstrated comparable confidence and psychomotor
learning outcomes when compared to a traditional teaching approach. Peer-topeer instruction is also an approach that has been demonstrated to be effective.
Concepts of self-reflection, self-assessment, peer-assessment and peer-feedback
are currently thought to be the principles that underlie this approach across
multiple applications for medical curricula.

4

Teaching students the process of

reflective practice through peer-to-peer interaction is thought to stimulate critical
thinking, assist with problem-solving and helps to emphasize the lifelong skill of
self-directed learning. The peer-to-peer approach also helps participants gain new
understanding, offers a fresh perspective and reveals alternative training
pathways that may help to accelerate future skill acquistion.

5

There have been no reports in the literature of a structured curriculum
model for peer-to-peer instruction of basic airway management for nursing
students although other skills ranging from obtaining a blood pressure to

6

performing sterile technique using a ‘bundled’ curriculum have been reported.

It

is hypothesized that a structured curriculum which includes a combination of selfinstruction videos, peer-to-peer instruction and guided peer-to-peer feedback
using structured debriefing, such as the Gather, Analyze, Summarize or GAS
model, will be as effective as standard instructor-led teaching of novice nursing
student acquisition of basic airway management knowledge, skill and confidence.

The peer-to-peer teaching method has the potential to be a cost-saving
alternative for teaching basic airway management. It can help to address the
problem of maintaining high quality training in the setting of rapidly increasing
number of healthcare student trainees yet a fixed number of instructors. If
demonstrated to be effective, this method could be applied for a wide variety of
learning objectives across a range of skills or techniques.
The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether peer-to-peer instruction
supported by a structured curriculum and video exemplars is not inferior to
standard expert instruction of basic airway management in the areas of
knowledge, skill and confidence levels.

METHODS
A single-blinded, randomized crossover trial was conducted with 48
undergraduate nursing students who were between 18 and 65 years old and
identified as novice-level with respect to basic airway management. After
obtaining exempt IRB approval for the study through the University of Pittsburgh,
investigators began recruitment. Subjects were recruited through a broadcast
email sent to nursing professors, as well as through recruitment scripts that were
placed in public areas at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing. After
expressing interest, participants contacted the PI, were read a research script and
instructed to register for an account through the Peter M. Winter Institute for
Simulation, Education and Research (WISER) simulation information management
system (SIMS) web-portal. After registration, participants entered the passwordprotected research portal and completed an online pre-course survey (to attain
demographic and attitude data) and a 10-item knowledge quiz. After the precourse survey and quiz was completed, all participants were directed to review an
online self-study module on basic airway management. Completion of this
module was verified through the SIMS course-reporting dashboard function.
They were then scheduled for learning sessions at WISER. Participants were
randomized into two groups (peer-to-peer and expert instructor) through a
computer-generated program (Figure 1). The learning sessions were two hours in
duration after which the participants were instructed to access the online
research course portal and complete the post-course attitude and knowledge

evaluations. After completion of the instruments, expert instructors offered a
supplemental instructional session to the students who had received peer-to-peer
instruction for either bag-valve-mask ventilation or airway management. This was
done to ensure that all students had an opportunity to receive ‘standard’
instruction in these skills.

Survey and knowledge test development
The pre- and post-learning surveys were created in a mirror pattern in
order to measure four learning components. The four components are:
knowledge confidence, stress during class, self-perception of knowledge, and preto post-knowledge acquisition. The pre- and post-learning surveys measured the
first three components using a Likert scale, in which each item was rated from 1
(strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). In the post-learning survey there was an
additional question included which evaluated participants’ preferences between
peer-to-peer and standard expert training of basic airway management skills.
Knowledge acquisition was measured with an online 10-item multiple
choice question (MCQ) assessment. The content was validated in an iterative
fashion by referencing each item to published literature and through expert
consensus by three airway experts who are registered nurses and Certified
Registered Nurse Anesthetists (CRNAs). The three airway experts were female
faculty members of a large US University with an average of 14.7 years of clinical
experience (range 8-25 years). These faculty experts were not a part of the
research team. After initial validation, the assessment had a test-retest reliability
coefficient of 0.82 from pilot tests administered to a separate group of 28 nursing
students. No changes were made to assessment items based on the reliability
evaluation.

Development of the skill checklists
The checklists for each skill were developed by using the standard
procedural manual from pre-hospital trauma life support as a guideline.

7

An

online Modified Delphi process was used to validate the content and the steps of
the checklist. There were 13 airway experts, from three nations with more than
240 years of combined airway experience (mean 20.3, SD 11.7) involved in the

modified Delphi process. Each expert reported managing at least 700 airways
within the past two years. Overall agreement with the items on the oral airway,
nasal airway and bag mask ventilation skills was high ranging from 0.82 to 0.98
average agreement (Table 1). Two blinded independent, attending emergency
room physicians working in a large, urban emergency room setting served as the
raters for the skill videos. These attending emergency physicians reported airway
management experience of greater than 8 years. The inter-rater reliability (by
Cohen kappa coefficients) among the raters was 0.77 for oropharyngeal airway,
0.84 for nasopharyngeal airway and 0.81 for bag mask ventilation.

Detailed Description of Learning Sessions
Simulation Setting and Devices
All simulation sessions were conducted at the WISER Institute of the
University of Pittsburgh. WISER is an 18,000 square foot, state of the art,
interprofessional simulation center which hosts more than 15,000 simulation
encounters annually. The mannequins used in the study were Laerdal SimMan®
(Laerdal Inc., Stavangar Norway) patient simulators because the airway structure
realism is similar-enough to a patient for effective training of basic airway
techniques. The following airway scenarios were introduced during the various
learning sessions:
1. A 32 years old male is brought to your department after a motorcycle
accident. He is unconscious and breathing loudly. You want to assist his breathing
by inserting an oropharyngeal airway. Please perform this procedure step by step.
2. A 45 years old woman has taken an overdose of sleeping pills and is
brought to the emergency room by her husband. She is semi-conscious and
snoring. You want to assist her breathing by inserting a nasopharyngeal airway.
Please perform this procedure step by step.
3. A 63 years old man has difficulty breathing for 2 days. His diagnosis is
severe pneumonia. Your attending staff orders you to give him one person bag
mask ventilation. Please perform step by step bag mask ventilation and
administer at least 3 breaths

Study Flow (Figure 1)
Subjects participated in two learning sessions: the oropharyngeal/
nasopharyngeal airway insertion session and the bag-mask ventilation session.
Each session was one hour long. Participants were randomly assigned to either
the peer-to-peer learning group or the expert learning group. There were 2
students in each group. Half of the participants were assigned to learn the airway
(oral and nasal) insertion by peer-to-peer instruction first and then crossed over
to the expert instructor teaching group for bag-mask ventilation skills. The first
groups were labeled as “Group 1.” The other half of participants learned airway
insertion through expert instruction, then crossed over to the peer-to-peer
learning group for bag-mask ventilation skill training. This groups were labeled as
“Group 2.” After each training session, each participant’s performance was
recorded on video without showing the participant’s face or other identifying
information. As noted, these videos were later viewed and rated by the 2 blinded
observers.
1.

The standard instructor-led teaching method: The instructors in the

standard expert teaching group were four experienced critical care nurses in the
third year of a graduate-level nurse anesthesia training program. Each instructor
had verified expertise in basic airway management (at minimum 600 successful
airway management experiences within 2 years.) All instructors were oriented to
teach the basic airway management skills in this study for standardization of
teaching techniques prior to the learning sessions. The instructors debriefed each
skill attempt using the Gather, Analyze, Summarize or GAS debriefing model
which is the recommended model at WISER. The participants in the instructor-led
teaching session had time to practice skills as much as they needed under
instructor guidance in the allotted one hour time period.
2.

The peer-to-peer learning method: The peer-to-peer learning method

allowed one participant to learn with another participant with the guidance of
self-instruction videos. The self-instruction videos contained steps of the specific
basic airway management skill, as well as a review of the GAS debriefing model to
guide peer review of airway skills. The knowledge content of the self-instruction
videos were reviewed for validity by the three Nurse Anesthesia faculty airway
experts as well as two experienced simulation educators with more than 30 years

of combined experience in simulation education and airway management. After
the participants watched the videos, they received a checklist for each basic
airway management skill to use as a guide for practice and reflection. The
participants in the peer-to-peer learning group also had opportunity to practice
the skills and debrief in the allotted one hour.
Statistical analysis

The standard deviation for basic airway management OSCE scores after use
of a self-instruction video has been reported to be 12.41%.2 This finding was used
to estimate the sample size necessary for the study. On an a priore basis, noninferiority was determined if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% confidence
interval of the mean difference did not exceed a 10% margin. With 80% power (1β), 0.05 significance level (α) and 10% non-inferiority limit (d), the calculated
sample size was 20 students per group.
Categorical data were analyzed using the Fisher exact test. The Wilcoxon
signed-rank test and the Mann–Whitney U tests were used for calculation of
comparisons between pre- and post-confidence and Likert scale data. Cohen’s
kappa coefficient was used to demonstrate the inter-rater reliability for skill
assessment. After non-inferiority was established, skill improvement effect sizes
between peer-to-peer and expert instruction were calculated using Cohen’s d, in
which the values of >0.80 are considered a large effect, 0.50-0.80 are a medium
effect, and 0.20-0.50 are a small effect. Statistical analyses were conducted using
SPSS V.18.
RESULTS

A total of 48 nursing students participated in the study during May 2017 to
July 2018. Twenty-four participants were assigned to group 1 and the other half
were in group 2. A majority of participants (69%) were women and the median
age was 25 years. Some subjects reported previous experience in basic airway
management through didactic instruction in airway management or through
practice with hands -on skill with mannequins. None of the participants reported
having performed airway management with actual patients. There were no

statistically significant differences between the two groups relative to previous
airway knowledge or skill (Table 2).
The scores of the participants who learned via the peer-to-peer method
were compared to the standard teaching group scores. The upper limit of the
95% confidence interval (CI) for each skill was less than the established 10%
margin (Table 3). These results demonstrate that for basic skill teaching, the peerto-peer method is non-inferior to the standard one. With further analysis, it was
clear that the peer-to-peer skill scores were higher than those of the students in
the standard teaching group with a large calculated effect size for each skill. We
calculated a Cohen’s d of 1.07 (p-value 0.002) for oropharyngeal airway, 1.14 (pvalue <0.001) for nasopharyngeal airway and 0.81 (p-value 0.003) for bag mask
ventilation.
The median knowledge score, from the 10-item MCQ, increased from 6 for
pre-learning to 7 for post-learning (p-value 0.09). There was no significant
difference between the pre-test and post-test scores between Group 1 and 2
(Table 4). There was one missing data point from a participant in Group II who
didn’t complete the post-training survey. Therefore, the analysis was done on 47
participants for confidence, stress and perception level. For confidence level,
participants in both groups reported higher confidence after learning in every
airway skill (Figure 2). There was no statistically significant difference in postlearning confidence levels between the peer-to-peer and standard teaching
groups with a p-value of 1.00 for oropharyngeal airway insertion, 0.77 for
nasopharyngeal airway insertion, and 0.26 for bag mask ventilation. The stress
during the learning sessions was significantly lower in the peer-to-peer group
(stress score of 1.41 and 1.47 for peer-to-peer and standard instructor-led
respectively, p-value 0.13). Further, the participants reported that the standard
instructor-led method could increase their knowledge and skills better than the
peer-to-peer group (Figure 3).
After each learning session was completed, the participants were asked to
choose their preferred learning method between standard instructor-led and
peer-to-peer instruction. Thirty-two students (69.57%) chose standard instructorled-teaching as the preferred method for basic airway management training.
Among these students, 17 participants (53.12%) were from the group 1

assignment (peer-to-peer instruction first). The participants were also afforded
the ability to add comments after their learning sessions (Table 5).
DISCUSSION

This study demonstrated the potential impact of an innovative teaching
method on knowledge, skill (both airway and peer-to-peer instruction) and
attitude (confidence). The teaching method combined self-instruction videos,
peer-to-peer instruction, guided peer-feedback and debriefing with the use of the
GAS model. This is a modification of what is sometimes described as a blended
learning approach with the added innovation of the peer-to-peer instruction and
a highly structured self-instruction video and feedback system.8 The skill
performance score, knowledge score, and confidence level of the novice nursing
students who learned basic airway management by the peer-to-peer method
were not inferior to those who had learned by the standard instructor-led
method. For the skill assessment score, the peer-to-peer group demonstrated
significantly higher scores with a large effect size in every airway management
skill category. The combination of the self-study video, peer-assisting learning,
and structured debriefing system showed a significant benefit for skill
performance. Self-instructed video teaching is effective in establishing
psychomotor skills because of the ability to display a moving image.9 Learners
tend to have a deeper understanding and longer-lasting memory with this
teaching approach because video can arouse more than one sensory
stimulation.10 Self-instruction videos have been demonstrated to be an effective
alternative learning method for cardiopulmonary resuscitation and basic
emergency skills for medical students and for baseline skill development for
nursing students.2,6,11 The peer-assisted learning approach has also been
demonstrated to improve under-graduate nurse participants’ outcomes in skill
performance, knowledge level, and communication skills.12,13 Similar to findings in
previous systematic reviews and meta-analyses, this study found that students
who learned via peer-to-peer teaching methods had no difference in skill learning
outcomes compared to those who were taught by standard instructional methods
with expert instructors.14 Students also have an opportunity to develop their
teaching skills in peer-to-peer instructional sessions which is a ‘value-added’ skill

for their future practice. Therefore, the peer-to-peer teaching method should be
considered as a valid alternative to standard instruction with the caveat that
careful consideration must be taken in development of instructional materials as
well as in quality monitoring. The structured GAS model debriefing method was
added to the peer-teaching in order to enhance the student’s ability to give
proper feedback. The GAS model is a simple and scalable debriefing method that
can be rapidly learned by a novice for the purpose of stimulating peer reflection
and debriefing of skill performance. The GAS model enhances learning by
providing the student with an opportunity for self-discovery, self-reflection, and
knowledge gap identification.15 Self-reflection has been shown to enhance selfassessment, self-monitoring, and skill performance.16
Peer-to-peer instruction methods were also shown to be non-inferior to
standard instructor-led methods regarding knowledge and confidence levels. Both
methods demonstrated higher knowledge and confidence scores on postknowledge tests. Approximately 70% of the participants indicated that the
standard-teaching method was preferred despite our finding that skill attainment
was greater after peer-to-peer instruction. Participants reported several
advantages to peer-to-peer teaching including less stress and the opportunity to
learn through teaching their peer.
The standard instructor-led teaching method has some disadvantages.
These include the need for high student to faculty ratios (in many institutions),
the high cost of instructors and the potential for lack of standardization among
instructors. Based on previous online surveys of 833 clinical teachers, the most
common challenge for instructors in providing high quality teaching is lack of
adequate preparation time.17 Thus an added disadvantage is the need for
additional and sometimes extensive time committed to instructor preparation.
Self-instruction videos and peer-to-peer instruction combined with a guided peerto-peer structured debriefing feedback model demonstrated significant benefit in
teaching basic airway management skills in novice students with minimal
preparation time. It also had the significant collateral benefit of reduced cost and
decreased instructor workload.

Limitations

This study demonstrated a non-inferiority effect for the immediate post
peer-to-peer teaching period. However, the long-term knowledge and skill
retention of the participants was not tested. Although this teaching method
appears to be highly influential in the retention of knowledge and skills for
students in the near term; it has not been tested whether peer-to-peer teaching is
non-inferior to standard expert teaching in maintaining long-term knowledge and
skills. A future study should include and examine this outcome.
Although the peer-to-peer method proved to be effective in teaching basic
airway management for novice nursing students, the ability to generalize the
method to other skills and participants was not analyzed. It is important to
consider that peer-to-peer teaching may only be effective with a certain level of
skills and participants. It may not be appropriate to use peer-to-peer teaching for
more complex knowledge and skills. It is also recommended that an in-depth
analysis and ongoing evaluation of the peer-to-peer teaching course be
performed to ensure that the quality of instruction is as intended. Further
validation of the self-instruction video is also imperative as it is the main
contributor to the standardization of education.
A last limitation is the established culture of the ‘expert instructor’ being
the gold standard for educational effectiveness. This is reflected in student
perceptions reported in this study that the instructor led sessions were preferred
and in the open narrative comments which indicated this bias (Table 5). It may be
necessary to include evidence-based findings on peer-to-peer instruction in precourse materials in order to help learners understand that this is a cultural bias
and not based in fact.
CONCLUSION

In conclusion, this study demonstrated that novice nursing students who
learned basic airway management skills with the combination of self-instruction
videos, peer-to-peer instruction, guided peer-to-peer feedback and structured
debriefing using the GAS model was not inferior to standard instructional
methods in the domains of knowledge, skill and attitude (confidence). Futher
analysis revealed higher and statistically significant performance scores for the

Comment
Less stressful with peer than “faculty” but both were equally
informative
2
Glad I did this.
3
Teaching another peer is actually extremely helpful for learning
yourself. I learned just as much by teaching my peer and practicing
with my peer as I did when instructed by an expert.
4
I felt that peer learning was appropriate for the nasal/oral airway
station. However I think it was less appropriate for BVM station where
instructor critique of technique was more necessary.
5
Excellent
6
It was nice to have faculty around to be able to ask questions (ie
related to real life/clinical situations). But I think that peer to peer
teaching is an effective way of teaching a new skill.
7
For demonstration purposes, I believe both the instructor and peer to
peer lead education was very similar. That being said, having an expert
instructor is always better for more advanced questions being
answered.
8
Both methods were helpful.
