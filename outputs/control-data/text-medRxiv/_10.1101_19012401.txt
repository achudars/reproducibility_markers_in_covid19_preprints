Abstract
Education and intelligence are highly correlated and inversely associated with schizophrenia.
Counterintuitively, education genetically associates with an increased risk for the disease. To
investigate why, this study applies a multivariable Mendelian randomization of intelligence and
education. For those without college degrees, older age of finishing school associates with a
decreased likelihood of schizophrenia—independent of intelligence—and, hence, may be
entangled with the health inequalities reflecting differences in education. A different picture is
observed for schooling years inclusive of college: more years of schooling increases the
likelihood of schizophrenia, whereas higher intelligence distinctly and independently decreases
it. This implies the pleiotropy between years of schooling and schizophrenia is horizontal and
likely confounded by a third trait influencing education. A multivariable Mendelian
randomization of schooling years and bipolar disorder reveals that the increased risk of
schizophrenia conferred by more schooling years is an artefact of bipolar disorder – not
education.

Schizophrenia is a heterogeneous neurological syndrome, typically presenting in early
adolescence, and observationally associated with lower intelligence and lower educational
attainment1–3.
Counterintuitively, education, which is positively associated with many health outcomes4,5, is
genetically associated with an increased risk for schizophrenia3. Intelligence and education are
highly positively correlated both phenotypically (r=0.8)6 and genetically (r=0.7)7. The traits are
bidirectionally causally related: higher intelligence causes more years of schooling and more
years of schooling increases intelligence8. The interwoven traits are also pleiotropically related to
schizophrenia: a recent genome-wide association (GWA) study found evidence of an increased
risk for schizophrenia for the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) tagging years of
schooling (P = 3.2 × 10−4) and strong genetic covariance between cognitive performance and
increased years of schooling (P = 9.9 × 10−50)9.
Three possible explanations exist for the associations between intelligence, education, and
schizophrenia: vertical, horizontal, and confounding pleiotropy (Fig. 1). Uncovering the nature
of these relationships could inform interventional strategies. To that end, this study uses
univariable and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MR) to appraise these pleiotropic
relationships.

Fig. 1. Possible explanations for the pleiotropy between intelligence, education and
schizophrenia. An example of vertical pleiotropy would be the SNPs for intelligence influencing
schizophrenia (only) through their effect on education. Vice versa, the SNPs for education might
influence schizophrenia (only) through their effect on intelligence. Since education influences
intelligence, an increase in intelligence from education might influence risk for schizophrenia
(a). An example of horizontal pleiotropy would be if the SNPs for intelligence and/or the SNPs

for education have independent, direct effects on schizophrenia (b). An example of confounding
pleiotropy would be if education has no influence on schizophrenia but appears to due to strong
association with IQ. Vice versa, IQ might not influence on schizophrenia but appears to due to
strong association with education (c). Multivariate MR can be used to investigate these
relationships.
The MR findings show that, for those without college degrees, older age of finishing school
(Education Age) associates with a decreased likelihood of schizophrenia—independent of
intelligence—and, hence, may be entangled with the health inequalities reflecting differences in
education. As such, targeted strategies to retain at-risk adolescents in school may be both
warranted as a prevention against schizophrenia and difficult to implement societally.
A different picture is observed for years of schooling inclusive of college (Education Years):
more schooling years increases the likelihood of schizophrenia, whereas higher intelligence
distinctly and independently decreases it. This implies the pleiotropy between schooling years
and schizophrenia is horizontal and likely confounded by a third trait also influencing education.
Further to this, bipolar disorder, associated observationally with both higher education and
schizophrenia3,10,11, was investigated along with education, also using multivariable MR. The
findings reveal that the increased risk of schizophrenia conferred by more schooling years is an
artefact of bipolar disorder – not education.
Results
MR-Egger intercept. Tables 1 and 2 contain the results for (i) the univariable (total) effects of
education and intelligence on schizophrenia, (ii) the univariable results for the (total) effect of
bipolar disorder on schizophrenia, and (iii) the bidirectional effects of education and intelligence.
The MR-Egger intercept column is shaded grey, as its interpretation is different than that of the
other tests; the MR-Egger intercept provides a test for directional pleiotropy and an assessment
of the validity of the instrument assumptions12. If the intercept is not different than 1 on the
exponentiated scale (or 0 on the non-exponentiated scale), that indicates a lack of evidence for
bias in the IVW estimate, as is the case for all the univariable results.
Education Years (Lee instrument) on schizophrenia. An increased (but null) effect on
schizophrenia is observed for Education Years (odds ratio (OR) for schizophrenia per SD
increase in years of schooling: IVW estimate 1.13; 95% CI 0.98, 1.29; P = 0.085). The
sensitivity estimators are discrepant both in direction and magnitude of effects, indicating
possible unwanted pleiotropy. SIMEX correction did not ameliorate this for the MR-Egger
estimate.
Education Years (Okbay instrument) on schizophrenia. In contrast, a robust increased risk
for schizophrenia is observed for the Education Years: OR for schizophrenia per SD increase in
Education Years: instrument estimate 1.49; 95% CI 1.23, 1.81; P<0.001). There is comportment
in the direction of effects among the sensitivity estimators. The weak F-statistic for the Lee
instrument may explain the discrepancy between the Lee and Okbay results.
Education Age on schizophrenia. A strong protective effect against schizophrenia is observed
for Education Age (OR for schizophrenia per SD increase in Education Age): IVW estimate

0.46; 95% CI 0.28, 0.76; P=0.002). The sensitivity estimators align both in direction and
magnitude of effects.
Intelligence (Hill instrument) on schizophrenia. A protective effect of intelligence against
schizophrenia is observed for both the Hill and UK Biobank instrumental variables. There is,
however, substantial disagreement between the IVW and MR-Egger estimates for the Hill
instrument, which was rescued by SIMEX correction (the direction of the effect is reversed
towards that of the IVW). The remaining discordance in the sensitivity estimators for the Hill
instrument likely indicates pleiotropy: OR for schizophrenia per SD increase in intelligence:
IVW estimate 0.76; 95% CI 0.63, 0.93; P=0.007.
Intelligence (UK Biobank instrument) on schizophrenia. A robust protective effect against
schizophrenia is observed for the UK Biobank instrument (OR for per SD increase in
intelligence): IVW estimate 0.86; 95% CI 0.78, 0.95; P=0.006. The sensitivity estimators align.

Bipolar disorder on schizophrenia. An increased risk for schizophrenia is observed per genetic
liability to bipolar disorder (IVW estimate 1.17; 95% CI 1.09, 1.26; P<0.001). The effect
estimate is reversed for the MR-Egger estimator, and the magnitudes of the various estimators
vary, possibly indicative of some unwanted pleiotropy.

Intelligence, adjusting for Education Age. The impact of intelligence on schizophrenia
attenuates to the null when adjusting for Education Age (adjusted OR for schizophrenia per SD
increase in intelligence: IVW estimate 0.92; 0.82, 1.04; P=0.219). One explanation for the
difference observed between the univariable and multivariable MR estimates for the effect of
intelligence on schizophrenia is that intelligence affects schizophrenia through its effect on
Education Age, rather than through a direct effect on schizophrenia.
Intelligence, adjusting for Education Years. The protective effect of intelligence remains after
adjusting for Education Years (adjusted OR for schizophrenia per SD increase in intelligence:
IVW estimate 0.84; 95% CI 0.74, 0.94). This suggests intelligence has a robust and direct
protective effect against schizophrenia. The effect attenuates some in comparison to the
univariable model, perhaps reflecting the loss of the contribution of Education Years to
intelligence (Table 3 and Fig. 7).

Education Age, adjusting for intelligence. A direct protective effect against schizophrenia is
observed for Education Age (adjusted OR for schizophrenia per SD increase in Education Age:
IVW estimate 0.51; 95% 0.30, 0.89; P=0.02).
Education Years, adjusting for intelligence. An increased risk for schizophrenia is observed
for Education Years (adjusted OR for schizophrenia per SD increase in Education Years: IVW
estimate 1.95; 95% 1.43, 2.67; P<0.001). Together with the multivariable results for intelligence
when adjusted for Education Years, these findings strongly suggest that the underlying
pleiotropy between intelligence and Education Years is horizontal in relationship to
schizophrenia (Fig. 1) and that the relationship is additionally caught up by the presence of an
unmeasured confounder. The horizontal pleiotropy and opposing directions of effect for
education and intelligence prompted a univariable investigation of bipolar disorder and
schizophrenia and a multivariable Mendelian randomization of bipolar disorder and education on
schizophrenia. The proposed hypothesis is seen in Fig. 3.

Education Years on schizophrenia, adjusting for bipolar disorder. The increased risk for
Education Years on schizophrenia attenuated to the null when accounting for bipolar disorder
(adjusted OR: IVW estimate 1.31; 95% CI 0.87, 1.98; P=0.207).
Bipolar disorder on schizophrenia, adjusting for Education Years. A direct, increased risk is
observed for genetic liability to bipolar disorder on schizophrenia (adjusted OR for
schizophrenia: IVW estimate 1.16, 95% CI 1.01, 1.33; P=0.033).
Bidirectional relationship between Education Years and intelligence. Table 2 and Fig. 4
depict the results for the bidirectional analysis of Education Years and intelligence. A SD-unit
higher intelligence causes more Education Years (β 0.45, 95% CI 0.42, 0.48; P<0.001) and a SDyear more of Education Years increases intelligence (β 1.90, 95% CI 1.80, 1.99; P<0.001). These
findings replicate those of Anderson et al. (2018)8.

Discussion
Educational attainment has been described as feature of the bipolar disorder10,11. Bipolar disorder
shares some cognitive deficits and genetic overlap with schizophrenia, but also predisposes to
cognitive adeptness and creativity that distinguish it from the more neurodevelopmental aspects
of schizophrenia3. This complex picture is reflected in the horizontal and confounding pleiotropy
uncovered by the multivariate analyses here. Specifically, when bipolar disorder is not accounted
for, it appears that more years of schooling increase risk for schizophrenia. Hence, bipolar

disorder is a confounder of the relationship between education and schizophrenia. Since more
years of schooling increase intelligence and higher intelligence strongly protects against
schizophrenia, these findings imply that staying in school is neuroprotective.
For those without college degrees, education—not intelligence—acts as the mechanism
conferring protection. The implications of this are uncertain, since the protective effect is likely
to be entangled with the social inequalities linked to educational attainment. Nonetheless, efforts
to retain at-risk adolescents in school, especially those beginning to show features of cognitive
impairment, may be worth exploring.
The primary strength of this study is that it capitalizes on the power of seven large GWA studies
to probe these complexly related traits. It is the most detailed and comprehensive joint
investigation of them to date. An unintended benefit of doing so demonstrates the value of these
massive public datasets for etiologic discovery.
The study has several limitations. MR critically relies on the validity of the instrumental
variables. As such, measures were taken to assess the robustness of the analyses to potential
unwanted pleiotropy, including the use of instruments lacking between-SNP heterogeneity and
comparison of the IVW estimate with a battery of sensitivity estimators, each making different
assumptions.
Another possible limitation, which, like unwanted pleiotropy, cannot be entirely ruled out, is the
possible introduction of bias caused by some instances of the same individuals being included in
the GWA studies of both the exposures and the outcomes. The greatest overlap is likely to be for
the Lee Education Years instrument on intelligence and the Hill intelligence instrument on Lee’s
Education Years. However, since that bidirectional appraisal is a replication of Anderson et al.’s
(2018) study that used non-overlapping samples with comparable results, the impact of the bias
is likely to be minimal.
Methods
Conceptual approach. MR is an instrumental variables technique, analogous to a randomized
control trial. It capitalizes on several features of the genome for causal inference: 1) the random
assortment of alleles (Mendel’s Laws of Inheritance dictating that alleles segregate randomly
from parents to offspring) and 2) pleiotropy (genes influencing more than one trait)13–15. Twosample MR (Fig. 5) uses summary statistics from two genome-wide association (GWA)
studies12,16–20, and multivariable MR is a further extension of the procedure that permits
adjustment21.

Fig. 5. Two-sample Mendelian randomization testing the causal effect of intelligence or
education on schizophrenia. Estimates of the SNP-intelligence (or SNP-education) associations
(𝛽̂𝑍𝑋 ) are calculated in sample 1 (from GWA study of intelligence or GWA study of education).
The association between these same SNPs and schizophrenia are then estimated in sample 2
(𝛽̂𝑍𝑌 ) (from a schizophrenia GWA study). These estimates are combined into Wald ratios
(𝛽̂𝑋𝑌 =𝛽̂𝑍𝑌 /𝛽̂𝑍𝑋 ). The 𝛽̂𝑋𝑌 estimates are meta-analyzed using the inverse-variance weighted
analysis (𝛽̂ IVW) method. The IVW method produces an overall causal estimate of intelligence
and/or education on schizophrenia.
Mendelian randomization assumptions. In order for MR to be valid, three assumptions must
hold: (i) the SNPs acting as the instrumental variables must be strongly associated with the
exposure; (ii) the instrumental variables must be independent of confounders of the exposure and
the outcome; and (iii) the instrumental variables must be associated with the outcome only
through the exposure18,22. When violated, assumption (iii) describes horizontal (Fig. 1b)
pleiotropy, which can invalidate causal inference from vertical (Fig. 1a) pleiotropy probed in
univariable MR designs.
GWA study data sources for instruments
Education Age on schizophrenia. Two measures of education were selected to instrument
education: age at completion of full-time schooling without a college degree (Education Age)
and years of schooling inclusive of college (Education Years). The Education Age measure was
obtained from field 845 in the UK Biobank project23,24. Participants were asked if they had a
college or university degree. Those without a college or university degree were asked what age
they left continuous full-time education. Summary statistics for a GWA study of Education Age
(adjusted for sex and 10 principal components), including 226,899 UK Biobank participants who
answered field 845, are publicly available; the GWA study was performed by the Neale lab, after
transforming the item into a normally distributed quantitative variable25 (SNP coefficients per
standard deviation (SD) units of Education Age). Because the instrument for Education Age
captures only those without college or university degrees, the inference from the use of
Education Age as an instrument is restricted to without college or university degrees.

The F-statistic, a function of how much variance in a trait is explained by an instrument (R2), the
sample size, and the number of SNPs in an instrument, provides an indication of instrument
strength26. F-statistics <10 are conventionally considered to be weak27. The F-statistic for the
Education Age instrument is 13.3.
Education Years on schizophrenia. The primary years of schooling measure was obtained from
the Lee et al. (2018) GWA study of 1,131,881 participants of European ancestry from 71 cohorts
28
. Education Years was measured for those who were at least 30 years of age, and International
Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) categories were used to impute a years-ofeducation equivalent (SNP coefficients per SD units of years of schooling). The F-statistic for
the Lee Education Years instrument is 4.7, indicating the instrument may be weak. Due to this, a
second measure of Education Years from a smaller GWA study of years of schooling was used
to construct a second instrument for Education Years9. The Okbay et al. (2016) GWA study used
the same construction of Education Years as did Lee et al. (2018) GWA study and contained
293,723 participants of European ancestry9. The Okbay Education Years instrument has an Fstatistic of 11.3. Because it is aptly strong, the Okbay Education Years instrument was used in
the multivariate model of intelligence and education on schizophrenia.
Education Years on intelligence (Bidirection 1). The Lee et al. (2018) GWA study was used to
extract SNPs for the first part of the bidirectional analysis of education on intelligence. The
instrument has an F-statistic of 5.8, indicating it may be inadequately strong. However, a
bidirectional appraisal of Education Years and intelligence using the Okbay et al. (2016) GWA
study for instrumental variables was previously reported8. The Anderson et al. study is treated as
a natural-history sensitivity analysis, since they included fewer and (likely) stronger SNPs (148
compared to 299, respectively), which can increase the F parameter29. (See Table 3 for a list of
the number of selected SNPs for each of the instrumental variables).
Intelligence on schizophrenia (Hill instrument). Two GWA studies were used to create
instruments for intelligence. The first came from the Hill et al. (2019), which included 248,482
individuals of European ancestry (SNP coefficients per one SD increase in intelligence test
scores7. The instrument’s F-statistic is 14.9.
Intelligence on schizophrenia (UK Biobank instrument). A second instrument for intelligence
was constructed from a GWA study performed by the Neale lab using the UK Biobank measure
for fluid intelligence (field 20016) (n=108,818). The participants answered 13 logic questions
within two minutes and the number of correct answers were summed. The data were transformed
into a normally distributed quantitative variable (SNP coefficients per one SD unit increase in
fluid intelligence score)25. The instrument’s F-statistic is 26.
Intelligence on education (Bidirection 2).
The Hill et al. (2019) GWA study of intelligence was used for the second part of the
bidirectional analysis of intelligence and education. The instrument has an F-statistic of 42.2.
Bipolar disorder on schizophrenia. A GWA of bipolar disorder containing 16,731 participants
of European descent (of which 7,481 were cases) was available for the instrument for bipolar
disorder30. The instrument has an F-statistic of 34.5.

GWA study data sources for outcomes
Intelligence. Because the full GWA study summary data were unavailable for the Hill GWA
study of intelligence, the UK Biobank GWA study of intelligence (n=108,818) was used as the
outcome GWA study for the tests of Education Years and Education Age on intelligence.
Education (Education Years). Full summary data were available for 766,345 participants in the
Lee et al. Education Years GWAS.
Education (Education Age). Full summary data were available for 226,899 participants in the
UK Biobank Education Age GWAS.
Schizophrenia. Full summary data were available for a schizophrenia GWA study dataset
containing 82,315 participants of European ancestry, of which 35,476 were cases31.
Instrument construction. For each instrument (𝛽̂𝑍𝑋 ), independent (those not in linkage
disequilibrium, LD; R2 < 0.01) single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated at genomewide significance (P < 5 x 10-8) with a trait were extracted from within their respective GWA
study. The summary statistics for the instrument-associated SNPs were then extracted from an
outcome GWA study (𝛽̂𝑍𝑌 ). SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome associations were harmonized
with the “harmonization_data” function within the MR-Base “TwoSampleMendelian
randomization” package within R16. Harmonized SNP-exposure and SNP-outcome associations
were combined with the IVW method (Fig. 2).
For the bidirectional associations between intelligence and schooling years, SNPs tagging both
traits at genome-wide significance and/or SNPs that were in LD between intelligence and
schooling years were excluded. This is because overlapping SNPs can invalidate bidirectional
MR findings20. In addition, for all instrumental variables, RadialMR regression32 was run to
detect SNP outliers. Outlier SNPs were removed. All instrumental variables included in this
analysis have Cochrane’s Q-statistic P-values indicating no evidence for heterogeneity between
SNPs33 (heterogeneity statistics are provided in Supplementary Tables 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 21, 24,
27, and 30).
Sensitivity analyses. To address possible violations to MR assumption (iii), MR-Egger
regression, weighted median, and weighted mode MR methods were run as complements to the
IVW method for the univariable models. When the magnitudes and directions of the various MR
methods comport across estimators, this lack of heterogeneity is a screen against pleiotropy. The
reason for this is that various MR sensitivity estimators make different assumptions about the
underlying nature of pleiotropy. It is unlikely there would be homogeneity in the direction and
magnitudes of their effect estimates if there were substantial violations to the pleiotropy
assumption. An extensive description of the different MR methods and the different assumptions
they make about pleiotropy have been previously reported34–36. In addition, a SIMEX correction
was performed for all univariate tests to correct potentional regression to the null in the MREgger estimates37 (Supplementary Tables 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 22, 25, 28, 31).

Number of tests. In total, 14 MR tests were run. Table 3 contains a list of the tests and the
number of instrumental variables (detailed characteristics for the individual SNPs used in each
model are provided in Supplementary Tables 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 20, 23, 26, and 29). These 14 tests
are not independent; a false-discovery rate (FDR)-correction was applied to the raw P-values to
assess whether the penalization changed the inference (Supplementary Table 2). As it did not, the
raw P-values are reported for the following reasons: the inference remained unchanged, the
FDR-adjustment is overly conservative in this case, and P-values alone are not the best guide for
causal inference38.
