ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND
Genome sequencing of large three-generation families allows de novo mutations to be identified in the second
generation, validated and phased in the third generation, and ultimately attributed to the first-generation
germlines in which they arose. Because germline mutations accumulate with age, we hypothesized that they
may limit the duration of childbearing in women, and if accompanied by accumulation of mutations in somatic
tissues, reflect aging rates generally in both sexes. Here we test whether germ cell mutations present in a
Generation I cohort when they were young adults predict two clinically important outcomes in those same
individuals: survival in both sexes, and age-related fertility decline in women. We also explore a possible
linkage between the timing of puberty and the establishment of adult germline mutation accumulation rates.
METHODS
Germline mutation counts in 122 Generation I individuals (61 women, 61 men) from 41 three-generation Utah
families were converted to germline mutation rates by normalizing each subject's number of mutations to the
callable fraction of their genome. Age at death, cause of death, cancer incidence, and reproductive histories
were provided by the Utah Population Database, Utah Cancer Registry, and Utah Genetic Reference Project.
Fertility analyses were restricted to the 53 women whose age at last birth (ALB) was at least 30 years, the
approximate age when the decline in female fertility ending with menopause begins. The age when adult
germline mutation accumulation rates are established was estimated by regression analyses of the
Generation I data. Self-reported age at menarche was available for 20 of the Generation I women.
RESULTS
After adjusting for birth year, sex, and parental age effects in Cox proportional hazard regression models, a
one standard deviation increase in the germline mutation rates present in the Generation I cohort when they
were young adults predicted significantly higher all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.97; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.12-3.46; p=0.019) in those same individuals. The median survival advantage for subjects with
mutation rates < 25th percentile vs. those with mutation rates > 75th percentile was approximately 8 years for
women and 13 years for men. Among women with ALB ≥ 30 years, those in the top 50% of germline mutation
rates had significantly fewer live births than those in the bottom 25% (p=0.026), and higher mutation rates were
significantly associated (p=0.036) with a younger ALB (<25th percentile, 34.8 years). Linear regression
analyses indicate that the germline mutation accumulation rates of adulthood are established no earlier than
middle to late childhood. We therefore investigated the hypothesis that puberty induces mutation accumulation
after a prepubertal phase when mutation burdens are plateaued. As predicted, among Generation I women,
those reporting older ages at menarche had significantly lower germline mutation rates. Furthermore,
Generation II parental couples with similar germline mutation accumulation rates (mainly reflecting mutations
accumulating in fathers) varied about five years in the paternal age at which they acquired the same number of
mutations, as would be expected if puberty, which also has a range of onset of approximately 5 years, causes
a resumption of mutation accumulation after a plateaued prepubertal phase.
CONCLUSIONS
Germline mutation accumulation rates in healthy young adults may provide a measure of both reproductive
and systemic aging. The data further suggest that mutation accumulation rates are established around puberty,
just when DNA repair genes' expression levels are known to begin their lifelong decline.

INTRODUCTION
The somatic mutation theory of aging1 proposes that somatic mutations accumulate throughout life, resulting in
apoptosis, cellular senescence, tumorigenesis, or other cellular pathologies, followed by tissue dysfunction,
chronic disease, and death. DNA damage is continuous,2 and while most of it is repaired, several classes of
DNA damage are known to accumulate with age.3-5 Serum levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) peak
during puberty,6 suppressing the FOXO transcription factors and the DNA repair genes FOXO upregulates.7
DNA repair systems continue to decline throughout adult life.8 Furthermore, developmental deficiency of the
GH/IGF-1 axis in dwarf mice prevents the normal decline in DNA repair of adulthood and significantly extends
lifespan.9 These observations fit well with the evolutionary biology principle that the force of natural selection to
maintain robust health begins to decline once the reproductive phase of life is attained.10,11
Several monogenic segmental progeroid syndromes in humans are known to increase mutation accumulation
rates and shorten the lifespan.12 However, no studies have yet tested whether inter-individual differences in
either somatic or germline mutation accumulation rates in healthy young adults predict differences in remaining
lifespan, as would be expected if mutation accumulation contributes significantly to aging. Fertility in healthy
women declines after age 30;13 age at natural menopause varies from 40-60 years and is positively associated
with longer lifespans;14 and women with a high age at last birth and their siblings enjoy increased longevity.15
Whether variation between healthy women in the decline and end of fertility may be attributable, at least in
part, to differences in germline mutation accumulation rates is unknown. Similarly, while somatic mutations are
known contributors to tumorigenesis,16 a connection between mutation accumulation rates in healthy young
adults and cancer risks has not yet been established.
De novo mutations in the germ cells of parents can be found by sequencing the genomes of parents+offspring
trios in somatic tissue (e.g. a blood sample), identifying high-confidence sequence changes in the offspring not
present in either parent, and attributing each mutation to the parental germline in which it arose.17-19 The
number of parental germline mutations increases with parental age in both sexes, with higher baseline levels
and higher rates of accumulation in males. The higher mutation accumulation rate in men is expected, because
there is a risk of mutation each time a cell divides, and cell divisions and spermatogenesis are ongoing in the
male germline throughout adulthood, while oogenesis in the female is completed before she is born. For both
sexes, at a given parental age the range of germline mutation counts can vary more than two-fold between
individuals.18,19
Here, we used genome sequencing of 41 three-generation Utah families to identify mutations that were present
in the germ cells of the Generation I individuals when they were healthy young adults. We then test whether
the counts of germline autosomal mutations are associated with two clinically important life history traits
tracked in these same individuals over decades of follow-up: lifespan in both sexes and the duration of
childbearing in women, as would be expected if germline mutation accumulation reflects the rate of both
systemic and reproductive aging. We also investigate the hypothesis that puberty triggers the germline
mutation accumulation rates of adulthood.
METHODS
HUMAN SUBJECTS
In the early 1980s 46 three-generation Utah families were contacted and enrolled in a project to build the first
comprehensive human genetic linkage map.20,21 Each Utah CEPH (Centre d’Etude du Polymorphisme Humain)
family consists of 4–15 siblings in the youngest generation (Generation III), their two parents (Generation II),
and two to four grandparents (Generation I), as shown in Figure S1 in the Supplemental Materials. Here we
study 122 Generation I individuals (61 women and 61 men) from 41 of the families, as well as 40 Generation II
parental couples and their 350 Generation III offspring. DNA was extracted from blood samples collected in the
early 1980s and/or early 2000s. All participants provided written informed consent, and all studies were
conducted with University of Utah Institutional Review Board approval.
GERMLINE DE NOVO MUTATION RATES
Genome sequencing of whole blood DNA from 603 individuals from 41 three-generation families, identification
of autosomal de novo mutations (single base substitutions and insertions and deletions of length 10 basepairs
or less) in Generation II and their validation and phasing in Generation III, and specific attribution of each
mutation to the germline of a Generation I individual is described by Sasani and colleagues.19 The Generation I
germline autosomal mutation counts that were the basis for our analyses herein of survival and reproductive
lifespan are shown in Figure S2. Instead of using simple counts of Generation I germline mutations, our

analyses used germline mutation rates, obtained by dividing the number of mutations by the callable fraction of
the subject’s genome (number of mutations / number of diploid autosomal callable basepairs), to adjust for
minor differences between subjects in the portion of the genome that met our requirements for validating
mutations (Sasani et al.,19 pp. 14-16).
Differences between Generation I individuals in their germline mutation rates are unlikely to be due to
differences across the cohort in the presence or absence or degree of progression of various terminal
illnesses, since all Generation I subjects survived more than 20 years past the age at which they transmitted
these germ cell mutations to their offspring. Furthermore, it is unlikely that any of the mutations analyzed here
are strongly deleterious, since all Generation II individuals in whom the de novo mutations were identified are
known to have reached maturity and subsequently conceived several children of their own.
OUTCOMES
Generation I subjects were linked to the Utah Population Database (UPDB), a large and comprehensive
resource of linked population-based information for demographic, genetic, and epidemiological studies
(https://uofuhealth.utah.edu/huntsman/utah-population-database/acknowledging-updb.php). The UPDB is a
dynamic genealogical and medical database that receives annual updates of Utah birth, death, driver’s license
and health records. All research access to the UPDB requires the approval of the University of Utah’s
Resource for Genetic and Epidemiologic Research (RGE) and its Institutional Review Board (IRB). Mortality
was ascertained based on Utah death certificates linked to the UPDB. Causes of death were available in
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes version 9-10 and aggregated into larger categories
representing the leading causes of deaths. Cancer incidence records were from the Utah Cancer Registry
(https://uofuhealth.utah.edu/utah-cancer-registry/). Fertility in Generation I women was assessed by parity
(number of live births) and age at last birth, both derived from the UPDB. Self-reported age at menarche
(answer to the question, “At what age did your menstrual periods start [age in years]?”) was provided by the
Utah Genetic Reference Project.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Demographic characteristics of Generation I male and female subjects were compared using t-tests for
continuous variables and chi-square tests for categorical variables.
Sex-specific Cox proportional hazard models with adjustments for subject’s birth year and subject’s parental
age (i.e. their age when the child was born in whom the de novo mutations were discovered, a.k.a. the index
child), were used to estimate the effects of germline mutation rates, treated alternatively as a continuous
variable and a categorical variable, on mortality and cancer risks, expressed as hazard rate ratios (HR) in
Generation I individuals. Results for both sexes combined were also adjusted for sex. Time was measured in
years from the Generation I individual’s parental age at the birth of the index child to time of death or last
known living dates (as of 2018). Cause-specific mortality was analyzed by fitting cause-specific hazard
regression models with Cox regression, treating failures from the cause of death of interest as events and
failure from other causes of deaths or those still living as right-censored observations.22 For cancer incidence
analyses, subjects were censored at age at death or age at last follow-up, whichever occurred first.
Poisson regression models were used to assess the effect of mutation rates on number of live births to
Generation I women. Logistic regression models were used to assess the association between mutation rates
and age at last birth (ALB) where ALB was treated as a categorical variable. All fertility analyses in these
Generation I women were adjusted for subject’s birth year and subject’s parental age and only included women
with an ALB ³ 30 years, since cessation of childbearing prior to age 30 is unlikely due to reproductive aging.13
Statistical adjustments for multiple comparisons were not included in our analyses of survival and reproductive
lifespan, because the comparisons all focused on a single prediction - that higher sex- and age-adjusted
numbers of germline mutations would be associated with the earlier occurrence of key milestones of aging (i.e.
cessation of childbearing and death). All comparisons showing unadjusted significant differences supported the
prediction, strongly suggesting that the low unadjusted p-values we observed in several comparisons are
unlikely due to chance alone.
The association of germline mutation rates with age at menarche in the 20 Generation I women for whom
menarcheal age was available was tested by a Pearson correlation (r) analysis, using 5000 bootstrapped
samples, given the small sample size. The bootstrap takes many random samples of the data of size 20 with
replacement. The significance of the statistic (r in this case) is based on the resulting mean of the distribution
of bootstrapped estimates. The significance of the difference in mean age at menarche between women with

germline mutation rates ≥ 50th percentile vs. women with rates < 50th percentile was also analyzed by a two-tail
t-test.
RESULTS
CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SUBJECTS
In developing genetic linkage maps, the large sibship sizes of the Utah CEPH families allowed the segregation
of genetic markers to be replicated in informative families, and the inclusion of grandparents helped to phase
genetic loci being investigated.20,21 The families were not selected for any disease, but for large sibship
size. Selecting for large sibships may select somewhat for higher than average fertility, and selecting for living
grandparents may select somewhat for higher than average lifespan; however, large sibships are common in
Utah, and more than half of the grandparents were younger than age 72 at the time of the initial enrollment.
Therefore, these families are unlikely to be strongly enriched for factors contributing to longer reproductive
lifespans and longer life. Furthermore, since the same selection criteria were applied across all collected
families, these criteria are not expected to introduce any biases that would affect the current study. Nearly all
the Utah CEPH grandparents are of Northern European descent. Table S1 presents the demographic
characteristics of the 122 Generation I grandparents studied here.
SURVIVAL ANALYSES
Associations of germline mutation rates with all-cause mortality, cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality and
non-CVD mortality were analyzed (Table 1). After adjusting for birth year, sex and parental age effects in Cox
proportional hazard regression models, a one standard deviation increase in mutation rates was significantly
associated with higher all-cause mortality in both sexes combined (hazard ratio [HR], 1.97; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.12-3.46; p=0.019).
All categorical comparisons used < 25th percentile of mutation rates as the reference category. Women in the
top 75% of mutation rates (i.e. ≥ 25th percentile) had higher all-cause mortality than women in the bottom
25% (HR, 2.14; 95% CI, 1.03-4.46; p=0.043); and men in the top 25% of mutation rates had higher all-cause
mortality than men in the bottom 25% (HR, 4.37; 95% CI, 1.54-12.44; p=0.006). Tests for trend based on
quartiles of germline mutation rates showed that for the full sample and for males, increasing mutation rates by
quartile were significantly associated with greater mortality risk; for females this trend was not significant.
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, which includes deaths from heart disease, stroke, and hypertension,
was significantly increased only in men with mutation rates > 75th percentile (HR, 5.30; 95% CI, 1.21-23.31;
p=0.027); this is supported by the test for trend (p=0.052). Non-CVD mortality increased significantly with
increasing mutation rates in both sexes combined (p=0.004), and in women analyzed independently (p=0.002).
Non-CVD mortality is a category in which no single cause of death dominates. These results suggest a model
whereby germline mutation rates are associated with somatic mutation rates across multiple tissues, with the
accumulation of somatic mutations contributing to the development of a diverse set of aging-related lethal
diseases.
Figure 1 presents adjusted survival curves by quartile of germline mutation rate showing that the median
survival advantage for subjects with mutation rates < 25th percentile vs. those with mutation rates > 75th
percentile was approximately 8 years for women and 13 years for men. Time was measured in years from
parental age at the birth of the index child to time of death or last known living dates (as of 2018).
CANCER INCIDENCE
In the set of 122 Generation I individuals, there were 16 women and 18 men who received at least one cancer
diagnosis in their lifetimes. We sought to test the hypothesis that in the full cohort of 122 subjects, lower sexand parental age-adjusted germline mutation rates would be associated with lower age-specific cancer risks
(Table S2), as would be expected if germline mutation accumulation rates reflect somatic mutation
accumulation rates. Associations were tested with germline mutation rates treated as a continuous variable
and separately, as a categorical variable where the cancer risk in each higher quartile of mutation rates is
compared to the cancer risk in the lowest quartile. No significant associations of germline mutation rates with
cancer risk were found. Similar germline mutation and cancer incidence data from larger cohorts are needed to
further investigate this hypothesis.
FERTILITY OF WOMEN
We hypothesized that germline mutation accumulation may contribute to oocyte atresia, lower rates of
fertilization, higher rates of miscarriage, earlier menopause, and consequently shorter reproductive lifespans.
Therefore, we tested whether women with higher germline mutation rates gave birth to fewer children, and also

gave birth to their last child at younger ages, than women with lower germline mutation rates. The thresholds
for mutation rates (25th percentile = 1.941 x 10-9, 50th percentile = 2.343 x 10-9, and 75th percentile
= 3.097 x 10-9) and the threshold for ALB < 25th percentile (34.8 years) were calculated using the 53
Generation I women with age at last birth ≥ 30. Among women with ALB ≥ 30 years, those in the top 50% of
mutation rates had significantly fewer live births than those in the bottom 25% (p=0.026, Table 2a), and higher
mutation rates were significantly associated (p=0.036, Table 2b) with a younger ALB (< 25th percentile, 34.8
years). We also tested the effect of germline mutation rates as a continuous or categorical variable on ALB as
a continuous variable (Table S3), and no significant association was found.
WHEN ARE THE GERMLINE MUTATION ACCUMULATION RATES OF ADULTHOOD ESTABLISHED?
Sasani et al.19 demonstrated in their Figure 3c and 3d a greater than 3-fold range of germline mutation
accumulation rates in 40 CEPH Generation II parental couples (mainly reflecting the levels and rates of
accumulation of mutations in the fathers’ germlines). In light of our current findings that germline mutation rates
are strongly associated with longevity and reproductive lifespans, the longitudinal data from parental couples
suggest that the rate of aging may also vary approximately 3-fold between individuals. Remarkably, recent
studies of inter-individual variation in the pace of aging in young adults, based on longitudinally collected
anthropometry and measures of physical performance, physiological functioning, cellular and biochemical
markers, and gum health also found approximately 3-fold variation between individuals.23,24
Our data suggesting that germline mutation accumulation rates in young adults may represent the rate (or at
least a rate) of aging, taken together with published models suggesting that germline mutation counts may be
plateaued (i.e. not changing with age) prepubertally,25 and the observation that the risk of dying is also
plateaued during the prepubertal years,26 prompted us to explore the hypothesis from evolutionary theory that
aging begins at or soon after puberty, due to a decline in the force of natural selection to maintain robust health
once the reproductive phase of life is attained.10,11
To further investigate this hypothesis using our available data, we first estimated when the germline mutation
accumulaton rates of adulthood are established, by plotting germline mutation counts (x axis) vs. age (y axis)
for our 122 Generation I subjects (Figure 2). The y intercepts of these plots are the ages when the mutation
counts would go to zero based on the slopes of the regression lines. Therefore, the y intercepts are
approximate lower bounds for when the observed mutation accumulation rates were established, about 18
years for females and 14 years for males. This timing suggests that puberty may indeed have a causal role in
establishing the mutation accumulation rates of adulthood.
Second, we tested another prediction of the hypothesis, that later onsets of puberty should be accompanied by
delays in mutation accumulation and lower age-adjusted mutation counts. Age at menarche data was available
for 20 of the Generation I women. We found that older ages at menarche were significantly associated with
lower germline mutation rates by a Pearson correlation (r) analysis (r = -0.026, p=0.05), and women in the
bottom half for mutation rates had a mean age at menarche significantly higher than the mean age at
menarche of women in the top half for mutation rates (two-tailed t-test, p=0.0273). These relationships, shown
in Figure 3, are expected if germline mutation accumulation in women is held in check prebubertally, and
resumes as a consequence of puberty onset.
Third, since the range of onset of puberty is about five years,27 the hypothesis further predicts that adults with
equivalent mutation accumulation rates should vary about five years in the age at which they acquire the same
number of mutations, since they should also vary ~5 years in the age at which they resume accumulating
mutations after the prepubertal plateau. We found this prediction to be confirmed in men in previously reported
longitudinally collected data on germline mutation accumulation in parental couples (Figure S3), keeping in
mind that the mutation accumulation in parental couples mainly reflects the levels and rates of accumulation of
mutations in the fathers’ germlines.
Taken together, these results from both sexes suggest a model whereby puberty induces germline mutation
accumulation after a relatively quiescent prepubertal period when mutation burdens may be plateaued.
DISCUSSION
Here we show that lower sex- and parental age-adjusted germline mutation counts in young adults predict
longer lifespans for those same individuals, and higher parity and older age at last birth for women. Therefore,
germline mutation accumulation rates in young adults may provide a measure, at least in part, of the rates of
both reproductive and systemic aging. To our knowledge this is the youngest age range yet in which a
molecular biomarker measured in healthy individuals has been found to predict remaining life expectancy. We

encourage replications of our analyses in other populations, especially those with counts of germline mutations
and clinical follow-up data already in hand, to determine whether our findings and conclusions will be
corroborated.
It is unlikely that germline mutation accumulation rates directly influence the rate of systemic aging, since the
lifespans of castrated and non-castrated men do not differ.28 While mutation accumulation rates are much
lower in germline than in soma,29 many of the effectors of DNA damage and the repair systems defending
against it are shared across tissues.1,2,8,30,31 Therefore, ranking sex- and age-matched individuals by their
germline mutation accumulation rates may effectively also rank them by their somatic mutation accumulation
rates, in which case the associations we have identified may be interpreted as providing strong support for the
somatic mutation theory of aging.
Several recent studies32-34 have reported that somatic mutations in blood nuclear DNA can be detected and
quantified in nearly all healthy middle-aged and older individuals, and that higher somatic mutation levels
predict higher all-cause mortality. However, there is little data on the dynamics of accumulation of somatic
mutations in non-tumor tissues at younger ages. At present most of the relevant available data come from
analyzing DNA sequences from tumors, which include somatically acquired neutral (i.e. not tumor-promoting)
mutations that were present in the cell of origin prior to tumorigenesis. By sequencing DNA from many tumors
that developed at various ages across the lifespan, it has been shown that somatic mutation accumulation
begins in embryogenesis, pauses from approximately ages 5 to 14 years, and then doubles thereafter
approximately every eight years.35,36 Further work is needed to determine whether this pattern also holds true
for somatic mutations in non-tumor tissue. Remarkably, intrinsic mortality rates also plateau from
approximately age 5-14 years, and double every eight years thereafter;26 and the loss of health due to
acquiring any chronic morbidity begins in the teenage years and also doubles every eight years.37 Thus
somatic mutation accumulation after puberty may be a molecular correlate and major underlying determinant of
both the increasing risk of death with increasing age and the duration of the human healthspan.
Here we show that cross-sectional and longitudinal germline mutation accumulation data, taken together,
suggest a model (Fig. S4) whereby there is a plateau of mutation counts prepubertally, followed by a pubertyinduced resumption of mutation accumulation, at rates that vary more than 3-fold between individuals.
Importantly, polygenic risk scores for later onset of puberty are associated with longer lifespans in both
sexes;38 and later puberty is associated with decreased all-cause mortality in women,39,40 later menopause,41
and reduced risk of cancer in both sexes;42 as would be expected if puberty triggers the resumption of mutation
accumulation, and consequently aging, in both germline and somatic tissues.
After puberty, both metabolic rate, which correlates with DNA damage rates, and DNA repair genes'
expression levels decline with age43,8 and their rates and relative levels of decline are likely to vary between
individuals, due to both heritable genetic factors and differences in environmental exposures, including diet,
exercise, and other lifestyle choices. This range of influences, many modifiable by personal choice, likely
produces substantial inter-individual variation in both germline and somatic mutation accumulation rates and,
therefore, rates of aging. However, significant variation in healthspan and lifespan may be expected even
among individuals with identical puberty timing and mutation accumulation rates, if mutations are randomly
distributed across the genome, only occasionally having pathogenic consequences.
While investigations of the causes of variation in the rate of aging in adult populations are likely to lead to novel
therapies to postpone frailty and extend the human healthspan, further study of the effects of puberty on
mutation accumulation rates may also lead to important medical breakthroughs. Direct measurements of
somatic mutation levels in normal (non-tumor) tissues from healthy subjects throughout childhood are needed
to either build support for or refute the exciting hypothesis that the mutation levels are plateaued prepubertally.
Rather than always rising with age, mortality rates are known to be plateaued in some contexts, e.g. in humans
during prepubertal childhood26 and at age 105 or older,44 and in hydra45,46 and asexual planaria47 throughout
life. These mortality plateaus may share gene expression profiles that robustly maintain the integrity of the
genome (or at least prevent its further deterioration) and maintain other aspects of homeostasis as well,3
effectively putting aging on hold.
Interventions in adults directed toward returning mutation accumulation rates to the negligible or very low levels
that may be present prepubertally would be expected to have broad benefits, greatly lowering the risks for
multiple aging-related diseases and dramatically extending the human healthspan. Perhaps a relatively small
number of genes that are master regulators of gene networks maintaining genome stability and homeostasis

generally are downregulated at puberty, but can be reprogrammed48 or otherwise coaxed back to their
prepubertal levels of activity by a combination of lifestyle, dietary, and/or pharmacological interventions.

*HR (95% CI): the first row of each of the three sections (Both sexes, Females, and Males) presents the effect
on mortality risk of a one standard deviation increase in germline mutation rates when mutation rates are
treated as a continuous variable. For all other rows in the table mutation rates were treated as categorical
variables. The thresholds for mutation rates are: 1) females: 25th percentile = 1.936 x 10-9, 50th percentile =
2.343 x 10-9, and 75th percentile = 3.096 x 10-9; 2) males: 25th percentile = 8.327 x 10-9, 50th percentile = 9.877
x 10-9, and 75th percentile = 11.251 x 10-9. These thresholds were calculated using all 122 Generation I
subjects.

Relative risks were estimated using Poisson regression to assess the effect of germline
mutation rates as a continuous and categorical variable on number of live births of Generation I
women, and additionally adjusted for the mother’s own birth year and her parental age. All
categorical comparisons used < 25th percentile of mutation rates as the reference category. The
number of live births decreased by 10.4% for each standard deviation increase in the maternal
germline mutation rates (p = 0.104) with mutation rates treated as a continuous variable.
Women with mutation rates >50th percentile had significantly fewer live births than women with
mutation rates <25th percentile (p = 0.026). The test for trend also shows a significant
monotonic decrease in fertility as we move up the categories of mutation rates.

Logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of germline mutation rates as a
continuous and categorical variable on the RR for ALB < 25th percentile and additionally
adjusted for the mother’s birth year, her parental age, and whether she had any children with
missing birth dates in the UPDB. All categorical comparisons used mutation rates < 25th
percentile as the reference category. For every standard deviation increase in the maternal
germline mutation rate, the risk of having ALB in the < 25th percentile category increased 2.45
times (95% CI 1.06-5.67, p = 0.036). With categorized mutation rates, the test for trend shows
increasing mutation rate categories are associated with a greater likelihood of an ALB <25th
percentile.

Figure 2. Estimating the age when adult germline mutation accumulation rates are established.
Cross-sectional data for germline mutations in 122 Utah CEPH Generation I individuals, based on de
novo mutations discovered in one Generation II offspring per grandparent. The y intercepts of the
linear regression lines, when mutation counts would be zero, provide approximate lower bounds for
the age when the observed mutation accumulation rates (slopes of the regression lines) were
established: about 18 years for Generation I women and 14 years for Generation I men.

Figure S1. Pedigree structure of Utah CEPH three-generation families. Circles denote
females, squares males, and diamonds third generation grandchildren of either sex.
Generation III sibship size ranged from 4-15. DNA sequence variants discovered in the blood
DNA of Generation II individuals had to be absent from the blood DNA of their Generation I
parents and present in one or more of their Generation III offspring to be considered candidates
for being de novo mutations that originated in Generation I germ cells. Additional criteria were

applied to exclude from consideration early post-zygotic mutations in Generation II individuals
(Sasani et al.19, pp. 9-10).

Hazard ratios were estimated using Cox proportional hazard models to assess the effect of
germline mutation rates as a continuous and categorical variable on cancer risk of
Generation I individuals and additionally adjusted for subject’s birth year and subject’s
parental age. Time was measured in years from age when the index child was born
(parental age) to time of death or last known living dates (2018) or first cancer diagnosis,
whichever occurred first. For the categorical analyses, all comparisons used < 25th
percentile as the reference category. Thresholds for the categories of mutation rates are
the same as in Table 1.
*HR (95% CI): the first row of each of the three sections (Both sexes, Females, and Males)
presents the effect on cancer risk of a one standard deviation increase in germline
mutation rates when mutation rates are treated as a continuous variable. For all other rows
in the table mutation rates were treated as categorical variables.

Multiple linear regression models were used to assess the effects of germline mutation rates
as a continuous and categorical variable on ALB of Generation I women whose ALBs were ≥
30 years. Effects were additionally adjusted for the mother’s birth year, her age when the
index child was born (parental age), and whether she had any children with missing birth
dates in the UPDB. All categorical comparisons used mutation rates < 25th percentile as the
reference category. The first row presents the effect on ALB of a one standard deviation
increase in germline mutation rates when mutation rates are treated as a continuous variable.
For each standard deviation increase in the maternal germline mutation rate, age at last birth
decreased by 12.3% (p=0.167). For all other rows in the table mutation rates were treated as
categorical variables.

Figure S3. Generation II parental couples with similar germline mutation accumulation
rates vary ~5 years in the paternal age at which equivalent numbers of mutations are
accumulated. Adapted from reference 19, Fig. 3c and 3d. Left panel: longitudinal data for de
novo mutations (DNMs) discovered in 40 Generation III sibships, attributable to the germlines of
the corresponding 40 Generation II parental couples. Each of the 40 plots shows the numbers of
DNMs found in each sibling in a single sibship. The plots are presented, left to right and top to
bottom, in order of increasing germline mutation accumulation rates. The mutation counts mainly
reflect the fathers’ mutations, as the fathers have higher baseline levels and higher mutation
accumulation rates than the mothers. In each row the horizontal blue line corresponds to 75
mutations accumulated, and the vertical red lines identify the paternal age at which the 75
mutations are projected to have accumulated. These paternal ages, derived from equations
fitting linear regression lines to each sibship’s datapoints, are written to the right of each vertical
red line. Right panel: the mutation accumulation rates for the 40 couples are listed from top to
bottom in order of increasing rate. Note the more than 3-fold range of mutation accumulation
rates. Blue boxes identify subsets of parental couples with very similar within subset rates. To
the right of each blue box, the minimum, maximum, and range for the paternal age needed to
accumulate 75 mutations is given. The average for this range, across the three subsets, is 4.9
years, suggesting that the age at which adult germline mutation accumulation rates become
established varies approximately five years, which is also the reported range for the age of onset
of puberty.27
