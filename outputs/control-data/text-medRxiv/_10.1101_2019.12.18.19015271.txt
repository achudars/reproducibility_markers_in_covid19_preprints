Abstract
Background: Mental disorders are one of the public health issues throughout the worldwide.
Among people with mental disorders, more than 21 million people have schizophrenia.
However, there is scarcity of information about perception and attitude of the community toward
people with schizophrenia in Ethiopia including the study area.
Objective: To assess the community perception and attitude towards people with schizophrenia
among residents of Arba Minch Zuria District, Arba Minch Health and Demographic
Surveillance System sites (AM-HDSS), Southern Ethiopia
Methods: A community-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 617 randomly

selected residents of Arba Minch Zuria District, AM-HDSS Site. The data was collected using
structured, pre-tested and interviewer-administered questionnaires. Descriptive statistics
including frequencies, means, and median were performed. Binary and multivariable logistic
regression analyses were performed to identify factors affecting community attitude.
Results: The finding of this study showed that, among study participants 469(76%) have a good
perception towards people with schizophrenia and 390(63.2%) of respondents have positive
attitudes towards people living with schizophrenia. Talkativeness and self-neglect behaviors
were the most commonly mentioned manifestation of schizophrenia. Substance misuse and head
injury were the most perceived cause of schizophrenia. Spiritual/traditional methods were
preferred place for the treatment of schizophrenia. Age of respondents, sex of respondent;
educational status and perception toward people with schizophrenia were significantly associated
with positive attitude towards people with schizophrenia.
Conclusions: Among our rural adults nearly half of the study participants have a negative
attitude towards people with schizophrenia. Therefore, giving special attention to females,
youths, uneducated and individuals who have poor perception toward people living with
schizophrenia is crucial. Also, future mental health promotion activities should focus on cause
and common manifestation of schizophrenia to improve the community attitude toward people
with schizophrenia

Introduction
Mental health disorders are health conditions that show abnormal behavior and thinking
associated with distress and problems functioning in family activities [1,2]. Schizophrenia is the
most common mental illness that affects educational and occupational performance [3,4].
Globally, Schizophrenia affects more than 21 million people that affect males more than 12
million, than females more than 9 million[3]. Africa accounts for 0.5 % of the world
population[4]. In Ethiopia, schizophrenia was ranked in the top ten causes of morbidity from the
total burden of disease [5].
Even though schizophrenia was one of the public health problems in Africa the majority of those
patients did not get treatment due to neglected in Africa’s health especially in Ethiopia[6]. The
“treatment gap” – the proportion of people with mental illness who don’t get treatment – ranges
from 75% in South Africa to more than 90% in Nigeria[6]. In Ethiopia, among people living with
schizophrenia only 10% ever receive effective care [4].
Evidence shows that one of the barriers to seeking help for people with schizophrenia was
negative attitude and perception concerning mental health are influenced by a lack of knowledge
as well as a mix of traditional and modern views [7,8]. In Africa, only 35% of people living with
schizophrenia were taken from modern psychiatric treatment. One of the reasons for this was due
to an unacceptable belief on the causes of mental illnesses and the type of treatment sector[9]. In
Sub-Saharan Africa stigmatizing attitudes towards the mentally ill exists, especially in the rural
areas with scant research in other countries and mirrored by the experienced stigma reported by
the patients [10,11].
In Ethiopia, mental health has been neglect that are not given attention for a long time, thus most
people use traditional methods for treating mental illness[5,12]. Study conducted in different part
of Ethiopia reveals that due to lack of available local means psychotic treatment many families
keep the people living with schizophrenia at home under restraint until they are no longer
aggressive and violent once the disorderly behavior is over they will be released from restraint

and many of them become wanderers and homeless. As a result, mental health services are not
given due priority and the needs of people for mental health care are not met [5,12,13].
Most Ethiopians' perceived that schizophrenia is an illness caused by supernatural forces. This
influences the attitude towards mental illness and help-seeking associated with mental health
problems [13]. Also, several factors are associated with the community perception and attitude
related to schizophrenia which is mainly socio-demographic including gender, age, religion,
income and education[13-15]. However, little is known about the perception and attitude of the
community regarding people living with schizophrenia in Ethiopia including the study area [1315]. Therefore, an in-depth understanding of community perception and attitude towards people
with living with schizophrenia may help to develop interventions that may contribute to an
enabling environment to fully access and utilize mental health services. So, this study aimed to
assess the recent status of community perception and attitude towards people with schizophrenia
among residents of Arba Minch Zuria District, AM-HDSS Site, and Southern Ethiopia.

Methods
Study Area and Period
This study was conducted in the nine kebeles of Arba Minch Zuria districts included under Arba
Minch Health and Demographic Surveillance System sites (AM-HDSS). Arba Minch town was
capital city and located at 450km from Addis Ababa and 275km from regional town, Hawassa.
The district was bordered on the south by the Dirashe special woreda, on the west by Bonke, on
the north by Dita and Chencha, on the northeast by Mirab Abaya, on the east by the Oromia
Region, and on the southeast by the Amaro special woreda. Arba Minch was found at an altitude
of 130 above sea level with the average temperature of 29OC. Based on the 2007 Census
conducted by the CSA, this district has a total population of 164,529, of whom 82,199 are men
and 82,330 women. Arba Minch Zuria district has a total of 31 kebeles with three different
climatic zones, high land, midland and lowland, among which 9 kebeles are used as HDSS. The
study was conducted from January 10 to 24, 2019(Figure 1)

Population
All households in the AM-HDSS Site was the source population and all head of households (or
their spouse) who were living in AM-HDSS during the data collection period and full fill
inclusion criteria were the study population
Eligibility criteria
All residents who were 18 years old and above living for at least 6 months in the study area
during the time of the study were included in this study. Those who were critically ill during the
data collection period were excluded.

Sample size and sampling technique
The sample size for this study was determine by using single population proportion formula
considering the following assumptions: the proportion of the community who had poor
perception towards mental illness was 37.3 %[14], 95% confidence level (1.96), 4%, the margin
of error, and 10% nonresponse rate. Therefore, the minimal sample size required for this study

was 617. To select the study participants, we used a sampling frame of the AM-HDSS database.
Then, based on the total number of households living in each kebele, study participants were
proportionally allocated. Then using a simple random sampling method the number of study
participants was selected using computer-generated random numbers.
Measurement
Attitude toward people with schizophrenia: It refers to a community feeling of expression
towards mental illness. It was measured based on 13 attitude related questions. To categorized
community attitude towards people with schizophrenia, we used the Demarcation threshold
formula. Those who score

≥ 39 were considered to have a good attitude towards people with

schizophrenia [5,13]. Demarcation threshold formula

Community Perception toward people with schizophrenia: It refers to the level of
identification, and interpretation of sensory information to represent and understand the
presented information. It was assessed by 9 items of five Likert scale perception related
questionnaires. To categorized community perception towards people with schizophrenia, we
used the Demarcation threshold formula. Those who score ≤27 for 9 items of five semantic
differential scales were considered having a good perception towards people with schizophrenia
[13,14].
Data collection procedure
The data was collected by using pre-tested structured interviewer-administered questionnaires
which was developed by reviewing different literatures [13-15]. The questionnaires were asked
after reading the vignette case. As recommended by WHO a case vignette we used modified
vignettes to assess community perception toward people living with schizophrenia using 9 items
of five Likert scale perception related questionnaires from 1 to 5 (1 = strongly agree, 2 = agree, 3
= neutral, 4 = disagree, and 5 = strongly disagree). To assess community attitude towards people
living with schizophrenia we used 13 items of five-point Likert scale from 1 to 5 (1 = strongly
agree, 2 = agree, 3 = neutral, 4 = disagree, and 5 = strongly disagree). This tool also has been
previously pretested and validated in Ethiopia and other Sub-Saharan Africa [13,14,16].

Case of Vignettes for schizophrenia

”During

the last six months, one of your friends has changed. He withdraws from his coworkers and

friends more and more. He keeps out of everybody’s way. Contrary to his former habits, he does not take
care of his appearance any longer and seems to neglect himself increasingly. He seems to be anxious and
agitated. He reports to be convinced that people are able to read other people’s thoughts, and that they are
also able to influence these thoughts; but he would not yet know who is controlling his thoughts. He even
hears these people talking to him and giving him orders. Sometimes, they speak to one another and mock
him. In his apartment, the situation is particularly bad. There he feels threatened and terribly scared. He
has not been at home for a week and hid in a hotel, which he has not dared to leave.” The tool was first

developed in the English language and translated to Amharic language then back to the English
language to check the consistency.

Data quality control
To maintain data quality was ensured during instrument development, collection, coding, and
analysis. Training was given to the supervisors and data collectors. The data collection tool was
pre-tested on 5% of the study participants in Mirab Abaya, before the actual data collection.
During data collection, the collected questionnaire was checked for its completeness every day
by investigators and supervisors

Data processing and analysis
Each questionnaire was checked for completeness. Data was collected using ODK software.
The collected data was cleaned and edited and analysis by using STATA version 14.0. A
descriptive analysis was conducted. Then, a binary logistic regression analysis was performed for
each independent variable and outcome of interests to identify independent predictors. Upon the
completion of the bivariate logistic regression analysis, variables with p-value <0.25 were
selected for the multivariable analysis. Context and previous studies were also being considered
to make a variable candidate for multivariable analysis. To assess the strength of association the
p-value ≤ 0.05 was used. A multi-collinearity assumption and goodness of fit test was measured
using the variance inflation factor (VIF), Hosmer and Lemeshow test respectively.

Community attitude towards people with schizophrenia
The finding of this study found that 243(39.4 %) of respondents agree that as a person shows
signs of schizophrenia, he or she should be hospitalized, more than half (55.9%) agreed that
schizophrenia is caused by substance abuse. Nearly one-fourth (22.4%) agreed that if treated and
medicated, people with depression can function fairly typically in society. Also half (49.1%) of
respondents agree individuals with schizophrenia are simply weak-willed, unmotivated people.
More than half (70.5%) of respondents agree that people with schizophrenia are dangerous and
half (49.4%) of respondents disagree individuals with schizophrenia do not need medication;
they just need to change their thought processes and behaviors. Also nearly half (49.6 %) of
respondents disagree that people with depression should have the same educational,
occupational, and social opportunities as ‘‘normal’’ individuals. More than half (65.8%) of
respondents agree people with schizophrenia have behavioral patterns that are abnormal and
nearly one-sixth (12.6%) of respondents agree most people fear people with schizophrenia
(Table 4).

Factors associated with community attitude towards people with schizophrenia
After controlling confounding effect variables like age, sex, educational status, and perception
towards people living with schizophrenia were significantly associated with a positive attitude
towards people living with schizophrenia in multivariable logistic regression. However, marital
status, wealth index, family history of mental illness and having information about schizophrenia
were not significantly associated with community attitude towards people with schizophrenia in
multivariable logistic regression.
The finding of this study reveals that respondents whose age between 18–24 years were 2.03

older age [AOR=2.03, 95% CI: 1.21,3.40].In addition, those females were more likely to have a
positive attitude compared to males [AOR=2.32, 95% CI: 1.58,3.41]. Moreover, having poor
perception towards people with schizophrenia was 4.95 times more likely to have a positive
attitude towards people with schizophrenia compared to those who were good perception
towards people with schizophrenia [AOR=4.95, 95% CI: 3.25 – 7.54]. (Table 5)

DISCUSSION
Among the total study participants 76% (95% CI: 72.6%- 79.4%) have a good perception
towards people with schizophrenia. However, the finding of this study is higher than the study
conducted among residents of Hawassa City, South Ethiopia, 66.5%[13]. But, the finding of this
study is lower than the study findings in Zaare Community[17]. This finding may imply a clue to
for policymakers to establish and strengthen community-based rehabilitation for the people
living with the mental health problem particularly for schizophrenic patients. Besides, it might
also aid a policymaker or health professional for better effectiveness of mental health program
through integrating patients care into a community where by they can live and possibly work to
be able to self-independent in the community.
The magnitude of positive attitude towards people with schizophrenia among residents in Arba
Minch Zuriya woread was 63.2% (95% CI: 59.4%- 67.0%). This finding was higher than the
study done in Southern Ethiopia, 37.3%[13]. However, the finding of this study is lower than
the study findings in Greek (ref) in which the majority of the public had stigmatizing attitudes
toward people living with schizophrenia. This discrepancy may be due to differences in sociodemographic and living standards and sample size difference.
Talkativeness and self-neglect behaviors were the most commonly mentioned manifestation of
schizophrenia among residents in Arba Minch Zuriya woreda. This finding supported by a study
conducted in Zaare Community[17]. This finding suggests that one has to exhibit behavior that
draws public attention and thus socially disturbing, to be recognized as having a mental disorder.
Also, health professionals should give special care to people who come with the complaint of
talkativeness and self-neglect.

As the study participant mentioned that substance misuse and head injury were the most
perceived cause of schizophrenia. This finding is in line with the study conducted in Zaare
Community[17].

Based on this finding the policymakers should develop intervention to

schizophrenia focusing on causes. The community member should keep their environment free
from substance misuse and injury. This may imply that we should need to provide more
knowledge and increased awareness of the causes of mental illness and also dispel the myths
around the causes of the disorders.
Concerning the preferred place for the treatment of schizophrenia, the majority of the respondent
mentioned spiritual/traditional places. This finding is in line with studies conducted in Agaro
town, Gimbi town and Hawassa City, South Ethiopia [13,14,18]. Thus, the need for awareness
sessions for the community on possible treatment options for better effectiveness of modern
antipsychotic treatment is important because the majority of people in this study area seek
treatment from traditional methods as a preferred method. Moreover, this study gives a hint of
improvement in the accessibility of mental health services in the communities.
The current study demonstrated that youths experienced a positive attitude towards people
schizophrenia more than those of older-aged years. This study is in line with the study done in
Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [19]. But, this study finding not supported by the study conducted in
Southern Ghana[20]. A possible reason for this may be the fact that youths are often the victim
of some type of mental health disorder during their academic life. As well those youths may
have more exposure to media than those of older aged.

The sex of respondents was also one of the factors associated with a positive attitude towards
people with schizophrenia. Those females were more likely to experience a positive attitude
towards people with schizophrenia than males. This finding was supported by studies conducted
in Singapore and Southern Ethiopia [15,21]. But, this finding is inconsistent with the finding
from a study conducted in Southern Ghana and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [19,20]. The difference
might be due to variation in study time and source of data.

The finding of this study found that those study participants who had no formal education and
primary educated were more likely to have a positive attitude to people with schizophrenia. This

finding was inconsistent with studies conducted in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, Singapore and
Southern Ethiopia [13,19,21]. The reason for this difference might be associated with living
standards. Since this study was conducted in the rural part of Ethiopia, but previously conducted
studies were from the urban part. Secondly, it might be due to educational access differences
between urban and rural.
Furthermore, the community perception towards people with schizophrenia was one of the
factors associated with a positive attitude towards people with schizophrenia. Those respondents
who have poor perception towards people with schizophrenia were more likely to have a positive
attitude towards people with schizophrenia.

Limitation of the study
This study may have some limitations. First, as this study was cross-sectional study it could not
ascertain the relationship between exposures and outcome. Secondly, there may be social
desirability bias on information of attitude towards people living with schizophrenia since we
collected the data by using interviewer administrative tools. Thirdly,

we do not know whether

highly symptomatic people were more or less likely to participate

Conclusion
In conclusion, this study found that nearly half of the study participants have a negative attitude
towards people with schizophrenia. Talkativeness and self-neglect behaviors were the most
commonly mentioned manifestation of schizophrenia. Substance misuse and head injury were
the most perceived cause of schizophrenia. Spiritual/traditional methods were preferred place for
the treatment schizophrenia age of respondent, sex of respondent; educational status and
perception towards people with schizophrenia were significantly associated with positive attitude
towards people with schizophrenia. Therefore, giving special attention to females, youths,
uneducated and individuals who have poor towards people with schizophrenia is crucial. Also,
future mental health promotion activities should focus on cause and common manifestation of
schizophrenia to improve the attitude toward people with schizophrenia
