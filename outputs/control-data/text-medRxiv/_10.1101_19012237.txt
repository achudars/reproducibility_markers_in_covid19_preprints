Abstract
Background: Prostate cancer causes substantial morbidity and mortality worldwide. Recently, a polygenic
hazard score (PHS1)—the weighted sum of 54 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotypes—was
developed and validated to predict age of aggressive prostate cancer onset in Caucasians. We evaluated
the performance of the PHS for prediction of aggressive prostate cancer and of death from prostate cancer
across diverse ethnic populations.

Methods: 80,491 men of various self-reported race/ethnicities were included (30,575 controls, 49,916
cases. Previously determined genetic ancestries for these men were: 71,856 European, 6,253 African, and
2,382 Asian. Where applicable, age of prostate cancer diagnosis, age at last follow-up, TNM stage, PSA,
Gleason score, and cause of death were also determined. Median age at last follow-up was 70 years (IQR
63-76). 3,983 men died from prostate cancer, 5,806 died from non-prostate cancer causes, and 70,702
were still alive at the end of follow-up. Patient samples were previously genotyped on a cancer-specific
array; PHS1 was adapted for compatibility with this array (PHS2) and tested in the multi-ethnic dataset via
Cox proportional hazards models for age of aggressive prostate cancer onset and for age at prostatecancer-specific death.

Results: PHS2 had 46 SNPs: 24 directly genotyped and 22 acceptable proxies (r2≥0.94). PHS2 was
predictive of age of aggressive prostate cancer onset in the independent, multi-ethnic dataset (z=48, p<10 16

) and in each genetic ancestry: European (z=46, p<10-16), Asian (z=44, p<10-16), and African

(z=24, p<10-16). PHS2 was also predictive of age of prostate cancer death in the multi-ethnic dataset
(z=16, p<10-16). Comparing the 80th and 20th percentiles of genetic risk, men with high PHS had a hazard
ratio of 5.9 for aggressive prostate cancer and 5.7 for prostate cancer death. Within each genetic ancestry
group, analogous hazard ratios for aggressive prostate cancer were 5.6, 5.2, and 2.4 for men of European,
Asian, and African ancestry, respectively.

Conclusions: PHS2 is highly predictive of both age of onset of aggressive prostate cancer and age of
prostate-cancer-specific death in a multi-ethnic dataset. Genetic risk stratification via PHS could guide
individualized screening and treatment strategies for fatal and potentially fatal prostate cancer for men of
European, Asian, and African genetic ancestry.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is a prominent international public health challenge. It is the second most
common cancer diagnosed in men worldwide, causing substantial morbidity and mortality1. Screening for
prostate cancer may reduce morbidity and mortality2–5, but to avoid the harms of overdiagnosis and
overtreatment of indolent disease6–9, it should be targeted to men at risk of developing aggressive or fatal
forms of the disease. Predicting age of onset of prostate cancer is important for clinical decisions
regarding if and when to initiate screening for an individual man10,11. Survival is another key endpoint in
men diagnosed with prostate cancer and is the American Joint Committee on Cancer’s recommended
endpoint for predictive models12.
Genetic risk stratification is promising for identifying patients with greater predisposition for
developing cancer13–16, including aggressive prostate cancer17. While rare genetic variants predict
increased cancer risk, their low prevalence limits utility in screening decisions18. Polygenic models use
common variants—identified in genome-wide association studies—whose combined effects can predict
overall risk of disease development18,19. Recently, a polygenic hazard score (PHS) was developed as a
weighted sum of 54 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that predicts a man’s genetic predisposition
for the development of aggressive prostate cancer13. Validation testing was done using data from the
ProtecT trial2 and demonstrated the PHS as an independent predictor of age of onset of aggressive
prostate cancer13. However, the development and validation datasets were limited to men of European
ancestry alone. While genetic risk models may be important clinical tools to predict patient diagnoses and
outcomes, using them may actually worsen health disparities20–24 because most models are constructed
using Eurocentric data and may underrepresent genetic variants important in persons of non-European
ancestry20–24. Indeed, this is of particular concern in prostate cancer, as race/ethnicity is an important risk
factor for development of prostate cancer; diagnostic, treatment, and outcomes disparities continue to
exist between men of different races/ethnicities25,26.
The aim of the present work is to evaluate the performance of the PHS in a multi-ethnic dataset—
which includes individuals of European, African, and Asian genetic ancestry. A subset of this multi-

ethnic dataset also includes long-term follow-up and survival information, affording an opportunity to
evaluate PHS as a genetic predictor of fatal prostate cancer.

Methods
Participants
We obtained data from the OncoArray project27; all data had undergone quality control steps
described previously19. This dataset includes 91,480 men with genotype and phenotype data from 64
studies (Supplemental Methods). Individuals whose data were used in the prior development or
validation of the original PHS model were excluded13, leaving 80,491 in the independent dataset used
here. Table 1 describes available data in detail. Individuals not meeting the endpoint for each analysis
were censored at age at last follow-up.

Polygenic Hazard Score (PHS)
The original PHS (PHS1) was developed to predict age of aggressive prostate cancer onset (age of
onset defined here as age at clinical onset, i.e. diagnosis). It used a continuous survival analysis of data
from men of European ancestry; details were published elsewhere13. Aggressive prostate cancer was
defined as intermediate-risk disease, or above. PHS is calculated as the vector product of a patient’s
genotype (Xi) for n selected SNPs and the corresponding parameter estimates (βi) from a Cox proportional
hazards regression:
PHS = ∑௡௜ β

(1)

The 54 SNPs in the model were selected using data from the PRACTICAL consortium and
genotyped with a custom array (iCOGS, Illumina, San Diego, CA)13.

Genetic Ancestry Determination
Self-reported race/ethnicities in this dataset included European, East Asian, African American,
Hawaiian, Hispanic American, South Asian, Black African, Black Caribbean, and Other (Supplemental

Methods). Genetic ancestry (European, African, or Asian) for all individuals in the dataset was
determined previously27,28 and used for the present analyses because they are objective and may be more
informative than self-reported race/ethnicities29. Briefly, genetic data from 2,318 ancestry informative
markers were mapped into a two-dimensional space representing the first two principal components. The
distance from the individual’s mapping to the three reference clusters, consisting of Europeans, Africans,
and Asians, was then used to estimate the genetic ancestry of the individual (Table 1).

Adapting the PHS to OncoArray
Genotyping was performed using a commercially-available, cancer-specific array (OncoArray,
Illumina, San Diego, CA)19. Twenty-four of the 54 SNPs in PHS1 were directly genotyped on OncoArray;
to adapt the PHS to OncoArray, we identified proxy SNPs for those not directly genotyped and recalculated the SNP weights in the same dataset used for the original development of PHS113
(Supplemental Methods).
The performance of this new, adapted PHS (PHS2), was compared to that of PHS1 in the ProtecT
dataset originally used to validate PHS1 (n=6,411). PHS2 was calculated for all patients in the ProtecT
validation set and was tested as the sole predictive variable in a Cox proportional hazards regression
model (R version 3.5.1, “survival” package30) for age of aggressive prostate cancer diagnosis.
Performance was assessed by the metrics reported during the development of PHS113: z-score and hazard
ratio (HR98/50) for aggressive prostate cancer between men in the highest 2% of genetic risk ( ≥98th
percentile) vs. those with average risk (30th-70th percentile). 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the HRs
were determined by bootstrapping 1,000 random samples from the ProtecT dataset, while maintaining the
same number of cases/controls.

We tested the performance of PHS2 for accurate prediction of age of onset of aggressive prostate
cancer in the multi-ethnic dataset. For prediction of aggressive prostate cancer, we included prostate
cancer cases that had known T stage, Gleason score, and PSA at diagnosis (n=60,617 cases, Table 1).
Aggressive prostate cancer cases were those that met any of the following previously-defined
criteria for aggressive disease6,13: Gleason score ≥7, PSA ≥10 ng/mL, T3-T4 stage, nodal metastases, or
distant metastases. PHS2 was calculated for all patients in the multi-ethnic dataset and used as the sole
predictive variable in Cox proportional hazards regressions for the endpoint of age at aggressive prostate
cancer onset. Due to the potential for Cox proportional hazards results to be biased by a higher number of
cases in our dataset than in the general population, sample weight corrections were applied to all Cox
models using previously described methods13,31 (Supplemental Methods). Significance was set at

α=0.01, and p-values reported were truncated at <10-16, if applicable13.
These Cox proportional hazards regressions (with PHS2 as the sole predictive variable and age of
onset of aggressive prostate cancer as the outcome) were then repeated for subsets of data, broken down
by genetic ancestry: European, Asian, and African. Percentiles of genetic risk were calculated as done
previously13, using data from the 9,728 men in the original (iCOGS) development set who were less than
70 years old and did not have prostate cancer. Hazard ratios for each genetic ancestry group were
calculated to make the following comparisons for men in each genetic ancestry group: HR98/50, men in the
highest 2% of genetic risk vs. those with average risk (30th-70th percentile); HR80/50, men in the highest
20% vs. those with average risk, HR20/50, men in the lowest 20% vs. those with average risk; and HR80/20,
men in the highest 20% vs. those in the lowest 20%. 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the HRs were
determined by bootstrapping 1,000 random samples from each genetic ancestry group, while maintaining
the same number of cases/controls. These hazard ratios and CIs were calculated for age of diagnosis of
aggressive prostate cancer separately for each genetic ancestry group. Given that the overall prevalence of
prostate cancer in different populations is unclear, we performed a sensitivity analysis of the population
case/control numbers, allowing the population prevalence to vary from 25% to 400% of that reported in
Sweden (Supplemental Methods).

Prediction of Fatal Prostate Cancer
We then evaluated PHS2 as a possible predictor of age of prostate cancer death in the multi-ethnic
dataset. For prediction of fatal prostate cancer, all cases were included (regardless of completeness of
staging information), and the endpoint was age at death due to prostate cancer; death analysis was not
stratified by genetic ancestry due to low numbers of prostate cancer deaths in the non-European datasets.
Cause of death was determined by the investigators of each contributing study using cancer registries
and/or medical records (Supplemental Methods). There were 3,983 men in the dataset who died from
prostate cancer, 5,806 died from non-prostate cancer causes, and 70,702 were still alive at the end of
follow-up. The median age at last follow-up was 70 years (IQR 63-76). As before, Cox proportional
hazards models and sensitivity analysis were used to assess prediction.

Controlling for Family History
Family history was also tested as a predictor of aggressive or fatal prostate cancer. This was taken
as presence or absence of a first-degree relative with a prostate cancer diagnosis. We also evaluated the
number of affected first-degree relatives (0, 1, 2, 3, or ≥4) as a predictor. There were 46,135 men with
data on prostate cancer family history (binary variable), and 17,619 men with data on number of firstdegree relatives with disease.
As above, Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess family history or number of
relatives as a predictor of each endpoint, among those in the dataset with available family history. To
evaluate the relative importance of each, a combined, multivariable model using both family history and
PHS was compared to prediction using family history alone, with a log-likelihood test and α=0.01.

Of the 30 SNPs from PHS1 not directly genotyped on OncoArray, proxy SNPs were identified for
22 (linkage disequilibrium r2≥0.94). Therefore, PHS2 included a total of 46 SNPs. Prediction of age of
onset of aggressive prostate cancer with PHS2 in ProtecT was similar to that previously reported for PHS1
(z=22 for PHS1 and z=21 for PHS2, p<10-16 for each). HR98/50 was 4.7 (95% CI: 3.6-6.1) for PHS2,
compared to 4.6 (95% CI: 3.5-6.0) for PHS1, demonstrating that PHS2 had similar performance for
prediction of age of onset of aggressive prostate cancer.

Prediction of Aggressive Prostate Cancer
PHS2 was predictive of age of onset of aggressive prostate cancer in all three genetic ancestry
groups. Table 2 shows highly significant z-scores as well as corresponding hazard ratios. Comparing the
80th and 20th percentiles of genetic risk, men with high PHS had a hazard ratio of 5.9 for aggressive
prostate cancer; within each genetic ancestry group, men with high PHS had hazard ratios of 5.6, 5.2, and
2.4 for men of European, Asian, and African ancestry, respectively. Sensitivity analyses revealed that
large changes in assumed population prevalence had minimal effect on the HRs (up to 1-2% change;
Supplemental Results).
Family history was also predictive of aggressive prostate cancer in the multi-ethnic dataset (z=32,
p<10-16). Among those with known family history, the combination of family history and PHS performed
better than family history alone (log-likelihood p<10-16). This pattern held true when analyses were
repeated on each genetic ancestry and when using the number of affected first-degree relatives. Further
details of family history analysis for aggressive prostate cancer onset are reported in the Supplemental
Results.

Prediction of Fatal Prostate Cancer
PHS2 was predictive of age of death due to prostate cancer for all men in the multi-ethnic dataset
(z=16, p<10-16). Table 3 shows highly significant z-scores and corresponding HRs for fatal prostate
cancer. Comparing the 80th and 20th percentiles of genetic risk, men with high PHS had a hazard ratio of

5.7 times for prostate cancer death. Sensitivity analyses, shown in the Supplement, again demonstrated
that large changes in assumed population prevalence had minimal effect (2-3%) on the calculated HRs.
Family history was also predictive of fatal prostate cancer in the multi-ethnic dataset (z=16, p<1016

). Among those with known family history, the combination of family history and PHS performed better

than family history alone (log-likelihood p<10-16). This pattern held true when analyses were repeated on
each genetic ancestry and when using the number of affected first-degree relatives. Further details of
family history analysis for fatal prostate cancer are reported in the Supplemental Results.

Discussion
The results presented here confirm the utility of a PHS for prediction of age of onset of
aggressive prostate cancer in Europeans and show that this prediction generalizes to a multi-ethnic
dataset, including men of European, Asian, and African genetic ancestry. Moreover, we demonstrate that
PHS is also highly predictive of death from prostate cancer. Comparing the highest and lowest quintiles
of genetic risk, men with high PHS had a hazard ratio of 5.9 for aggressive disease and a hazard ratio of
5.7 prostate cancer death.
We found that PHS predicts aggressive prostate cancer in men of European, Asian, and African
genetic ancestry (and an even wider range of self-reported race/ethnicities; Supplemental Methods).
Current guidelines for prostate cancer screening suggest possible initiation at earlier ages for men of
African ancestry, given higher incidence rates and worse mortality when compared to men of European
ancestry26. Using the PHS to risk-stratify men may help patients and their physicians decide when to
initiate prostate cancer screening: perhaps a man with African genetic ancestry in the lowest percentiles of
genetic risk by PHS could safely delay or forgo screening to decrease the possible harms associated with
overdetection and overtreatment9, while a man in the highest risk percentiles may consider screening at an
earlier age. The same reasoning applies to men of all genetic ancestries.
In the current dataset PHS performance is better in those with European and Asian genetic
ancestry than in those with African ancestry. For example, comparing the highest and lowest quintiles of

genetic risk, men of European and Asian genetic ancestry with high PHS had comparable hazard ratios
for aggressive prostate cancer (5.6 and 5.2 times, respectively), while the hazard ratio for men of African
genetic ancestry was 2.4. This suggests the PHS, in its current form, can differentiate men of higher and
lower risk in each ancestral group, but the range of predicted risk levels may be narrower in those of
African ancestry. Possible reasons for relatively diminished performance include the increased genetic
diversity with less linkage disequilibrium in those of African genetic ancestry32–34. Known health
disparities may also play a role25, as the availability of—and timing of—PSA results may depend on
healthcare access. Alarmingly, there has historically been poor representation of African populations in
clinical/genomic research data 20,21. This pattern is reflected in the present study, where most of men of
African genetic ancestry were missing clinical information from diagnosis used to determine disease
aggressiveness. That such clinical information is less available for men of African ancestry in our dataset
also leaves open the possibility of systematic differences in the diagnostic workup—and therefore age of
diagnosis—in the different ancestry populations. Notwithstanding these caveats, the present PHS is
already highly predictive in men of African ancestry for age of onset of aggressive prostate cancer,
possibly paving the way for more personalized screening decisions for men of African descent.
The first validation study of PHS used data from ProtecT, a large trial of prostate cancer
screening2,13 The screening design of that trial yielded biopsy results from both controls and cases with
PSA ≥ 3 ng/mL, making it possible to demonstrate improved accuracy and efficiency of prostate cancer
screening with PSA testing. Limitations of the ProtecT analysis, though, include the exclusion of
advanced cancer, as well as a lack, as yet, of longer observation to reveal which cancers would be fatal2.
The present study includes long-term observation, with both early and advanced disease19. This allowed
for evaluation of PHS as a predictor of both aggressive (i.e., potentially fatal) and fatal prostate cancer,
and we found PHS to be highly predictive of both outcomes.
Age is critical in clinical decisions of whether men should be offered prostate cancer
screening35,36 and in how to treat men diagnosed with the disease35,36. Age may also inform the prognosis
for men with prostate cancer36,37. Predicting age of cancer onset or cancer mortality is therefore of clinical

interest. We have shown that PHS is highly predictive of age at both aggressive prostate cancer onset and
prostate-cancer-specific death. Using a survival analysis, instead of a binary outcome (e.g., with logistic
regression) allowed for leveraging all of the available data, with censoring for unknown possible future
outcomes in men still alive at time of last observation. Furthermore, prostate cancer death is a hard
endpoint with less uncertainty than disease onset (which may vary with screening practices and delayed
medical attention). Therefore, this genetic hazard score may help identify men with high (or low) genetic
predisposition to develop lethal prostate cancer and could assist physicians deciding when to initiate
screening.
Current guidelines suggest taking into account a man’s individual cancer risk factors, as well as
overall life expectancy and medical comorbidities when making the decision of whether to screen6. The
most prominent among the risk factors used in clinic are family history and race/ethnicity6,38,39. The
combination of PHS and family history improved prediction over either alone in the multi-ethnic dataset.
This finding is consistent with the prior report that PHS adds considerable predictive power over family
history, alone13. Thus, PHS may help clinicians considering screening to identify men at highest risks of
developing aggressive disease. The clinical relevance of the PHS prediction in prostate cancer is similar
or better than prediction tools routinely used in other fields of medicine, such as breast cancer, diabetes,
and cardiovascular disease40–44.
Future development and optimization holds promise for improving upon the encouraging
prediction already achieved here. The PHS here may not include all SNPs predictive of onset of
aggressive prostate cancer; in fact, more SNPs associated with prostate cancer have been reported since
the development of the original PHS19. Also, there have been reports of SNPs associated with prostate
cancer specifically within non-European populations (including Asian, African, and Latinos)45–47. We are
currently studying how incorporation of additional SNPs, including ethnicity-specific SNPs, might
improve predictive performance—overall, or in men of specific genetic ancestry, particularly African.
Limitations to our work, beyond those discussed above, include that our dataset is heterogenous
and comes from multiple, diverse studies with different study designs. This allowed for a large, multi-

ethnic dataset that includes clinical and survival data, but comes with uncertainties that were not an issue
in the ProtecT dataset used for original validation. However, the heterogeneity would likely rather reduce
the performance of PHS, not systematically inflate the results. Secondly, while the genetic ancestry
classifications used here may be more accurate than self-reported race/ethnicity alone29, they do not lend
themselves to assessing possible nuances of admixed genetic ancestry within individuals; future
development will consider local ancestry. As noted above, availability of clinical information was not
uniform across contributing studies, and there was less clinical information available for men of African
genetic ancestry. Finally, we do not have information on how prostate cancer was clinically managed
after diagnosis for individual men in this study. Several disease-modifying treatments exist and may have
influenced post-diagnosis survival to varying degrees. Despite this possible source of variability in
survival among men with fatal prostate cancer, PHS was still predictive of age at death, an objective and
meaningful endpoint.

Conclusion
In a multi-ethnic dataset, PHS was highly predictive both of aggressive prostate cancer onset and
of death from prostate cancer. Polygenic scores might be useful to inform risk-stratified screening
strategies seeking to reduce disparities in prostate cancer mortality in European, Asian and African men.
