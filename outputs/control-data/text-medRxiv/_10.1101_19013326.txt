Abstract
Objective: To establish the preparedness of nursing homes to deliver high quality, safe and
equitable bariatric care for older adults with extreme obesity.
Design and methods: A collective case study approach was used. Data collection included
observational and interview data from three nursing homes, and a review of 224,200 resident
admissions over a 3-year period in New Zealand.
Participants: Twenty eight health care workers from three nursing homes in the North Island of
New Zealand.
Results: Despite a willingness by healthcare staff to care for older adults with extreme obesity,
nursing homes were not well equipped to provide safe equitable care for this resident
population. Key areas of concern for nursing homes related to limitations in the infrastructure,
and financial barriers relating to government funded contracted care services which
incorporated equipment procurement and safe staffing ratios.
Conclusion: Nursing homes are unprepared to accommodate the existing and increasing
number of older adults with extreme obesity who will require bariatric specific care.
Government agencies and policy makers will need to consider the financial implications of the
increasing need for bariatric level support within aged care, as well as the impact on individual
nursing home resources and quality of care provided. Considerable sector and government
attention is needed in relation to infrastructure and funding, to allow for the provision of high
quality, safe and equitable care for this population group.

Title: The care of older adults with extreme obesity in nursing homes: A
collective case study
Introduction
The prevalence of obesity increases with age and the numbers of people living with extreme
obesity is increasing globally(1,2). The Pacific Islands, United States of America (USA), Saudi
Arabia and New Zealand are amongst the countries with the highest rates of obesity
worldwide(3), with NZ obesity rates peaking in the 65-74 age group(4); and in adults aged 75
years and over, 24% and 1% are identified with obesity and extreme obesity, respectively.
Extreme obesity, as known as bariatric, is typically defined as a body mass index (BMI) of
greater or equal to 40 kg/m2(5). Within healthcare other clinical definitions of extreme obesity
are utilised which assist with care management: weighing ≥150 kgs; having a BMI ≥40 kg/m2 ; or
having large physical dimensions which affect mobility and make moving and handling
difficult(6).
People with obesity are more likely to develop chronic health conditions earlier in life leading to
increasing numbers of individuals with complex care requirements in older age(5). Obesity is
known to exacerbate age-related decline in physical function, declining mobility and mobility
disability(7). In the older population, extreme obesity has been associated with poorer lower
extremity mobility(8,9), with activities such as self-care and moving around physically difficult
or impossible(9). Obesity specifically compromises walking, stair climbing and chair rise ability,
especially if the BMI exceeds 35kg/m2(8,10). Obesity coupled with advancing age increases comorbidities reduces functional abilities(7), leading to an increase in health service demand and
utilisation(11). There is urgent need to understand the preparedness of healthcare services to
support this population.
Specific health needs of this population group, regardless of age, include specialised equipment
that supports the larger physical dimensions and weight of the person (bed, air mattress, chair,
commode, shower chair), specialised moving and handling aids (ceiling and standing hoists,
friction reducing devices, grip bars), and increased staff knowledge of specific clinical care
needs (hygiene and toileting, nutrition, altered centre of gravity during mobilisation)(6).
Additionally, an increase in safety precautions and the need for more human resources has
been indicated to prevent adverse health consequences(12).
There is a paucity of research related to older adults with extreme obesity requiring supported
care in a residential facility, often referred to as a nursing home, rest home or aged residential
care(13,14). These nursing homes provide hospital level care to their resident population.
What is currently known relates primarily to the USA population and is intricately linked to their
distinctive medical care system(12,14). Whilst more general concerns regarding the principles
of care are similar, such as infrastructure and staffing ratios(12,14), understanding the needs
and preparedness of nursing homes within other healthcare systems is crucial. To date New
Zealand research exploring the extremely obese population has focused on acute

hospital management(15–17), and little is known regarding the aged care sector. Whilst the
needs of this specific older adult population has increased, service support within the New
Zealand aged care sector has largely remained unchanged(18). This paper presents findings of a
study examining the requirements of nursing homes to deliver high quality, safe and equitable
bariatric specific care for older adults with extreme obesity.

Methods
The collective case study approach allowed for a holistic exploration and description of the
needs of nursing homes to deliver high quality, safe and equitable bariatric specific care in a
real-world context(19). A central element of case study methodology is the concept of a
‘bounded system’, the idea being that the boundaries are clear from the outset(19,20). The
nursing homes in this research related to one District Health Board (Regional Health Authority)
and all received government funded subsidies to support care delivery.
Study setting and recruitment
The study setting was three nursing homes in the North Island of New Zealand. The three
homes were purposively selected because of their unique philosophies and business models.
Nursing Home (NH) 1 was a charitable trust, NH 2 a privately listed company and NH 3 was a
faith-based organisation. Each home was approached and in turn granted access to the
research team. Participant recruitment was purposive(21) and all staff involved in the provision
of residents’ care were invited to participate in the study. This included those who delivered
regular direct care to the residents and those involved in the operational aspects and resource
allocation (nursing home and finance managers).
Data collection
Four sources of data were used; InterRAI1 dataset review, infrastructure spatial measurements,
nursing home profile data, and staff interviews. Data collection took place between March and
June 2019 with a minimum of one week spent in each home. National and home level InterRAI
data was collected from all residents admitted into care between 2015-2018 (224,200
residents). The data provided by InterRAI New Zealand was anonymised. InterRAI analysis was
specifically used to identify the prevalence and clinical profile of this resident population.
In preparation for taking spatial measurements, the research team developed and piloted an
observational tool to facilitate accurate measurement of space. To ensure accuracy of
measurements two members of the research team confirmed each measurement recorded.
Existing nursing home equipment was recorded along with specifications including the safe
working load. Equipment specifications were validated with equipment providers.
Profile data was gathered at each home and included the number of staff employed, staff to
resident ratios, staff turnover, vacancy rates and shift patterns. Nursing home characteristics
included occupancy rates, numbers of rest home, hospital and other beds, business models,

model of care, the number of premium and standard rooms, cost breakdown of rooms and any
additional charges for care. A standardised form for collecting this data was developed and
each facility manager completed and validated the information. Twenty-eight nursing home
staff were interviewed for the study (Table 1).
Semi-structured interviews were conducted by CH, HR and IA in environments that were
negotiated between the interviewer and the participant. Interviews lasted approximately 20-70
minutes. Each interview was audio-recorded and transcribed. Informed written consent was
obtained from all participants and data was anonymised with distinguishing participant features
removed.
Analysis
Each of the nursing homes’ profile data, spatial measurements, interview data, and InterRAI
data was analysed separately before cross case analysis was conducted to identify the
similarities and differences across cases(21). This triangulation of findings enabled a detailed
examination of both the phenomena of bariatric care and the context within nursing homes.
Best practice guidelines and standards were used to assess the infrastructure and care practices
within the homes(6,22–24).
InterRAI data were analysed using SPSS version 24(25). De-identified baseline characteristics of
residents were examined by age, sex, ethnic group and underlying clinical condition using
descriptive statistics such as proportions and means. Differences in baseline characteristics of
the three nursing homes were assessed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Chisquare tests for continuous and categorical variables, respectively. Point estimates of individual
facility scores for required spaces, equipment and staff were calculated and compared with
baseline and demographic data from InterRAI. All statistical tests were conducted at a
significance level of p = ≤0.05.
Content analysis was undertaken independently by CH, HR and LG to ensure consistency in the
coding of interview data. This approach is regarded as a flexible method for analysing text data
as well as being a pragmatic method for the development and extension of knowledge(26).
Interviewee responses were aligned to the specific questions asked using the semi-structured
interview schedule. Qualitative approaches to ensure the trustworthiness of the study were
used with specific attention given to uphold credibility, dependency, confirmability and
transferability of findings(27).

Results
Overview
The findings from this study highlight that despite a willingness by healthcare staff to care for
older adults with extreme obesity, nursing homes were not well equipped or ready to provide
safe equitable care for this resident population. Key areas of concern for nursing homes related
to limitations in infrastructure and the financial barriers of government funded contracted care
services which incorporated equipment procurement and safe staffing ratios. To understand

the contextual influences and significance of these care concerns the national prevalence of
residents with extreme obesity and the characteristics of the 3 nursing homes are presented.
1. National profile of residents with extreme obesity
More residents were overweight, obese and extremely obese than underweight in all three
homes (underweight 12.9%, normal weight 46%, overweight/moderate/ severe/extreme
obesity 31.6%, missing data 9.5%) and this was comparable to the national trend in BMI ranges
across all nursing homes in New Zealand. The national prevalence of residents with overweight,
mild/moderate, severe and extreme obesity were 22.1%, 6.7%, 3.7% and 1.1%, respectively.
Between 2015-2018 there were 3,811 residents nationally who required some level of bariatric
support from their home (Table 2). The heaviest resident cared for within a facility was 264kg
(582lbs) and within the 3 homes the heaviest resident ranged from 138-180kg (304-396lbs).
2. Nursing home characteristics
Operating with different business models, each home had explicit value statements that
reflected the nature and purpose of their organisation and included concepts like respect,
compassion, holism and excellence. Each nursing home had unique histories for their respective
buildings. The charitable and publicly listed homes were purpose-built for the delivery of aged
care services. The former facility had benefitted from a recent building extension designed to
cater for older adults in need of hospital level care. However, extreme obesity was not
considered in the planning stage. Whilst the latter home was outdated and did not meet the
specifications that were currently used by the present owners for all newly constructed
buildings. The faith-based home was operating from a building that was originally designed for
a variety of purposes other than aged care. None of the homes had been purpose-built to
accommodate residents with extreme obesity.
The nursing homes sizes ranged from 57 to 153 beds (NH 1, 150 beds; NH 2, 153; NH 3, 57
beds). There was a distinction made between the cost of standard versus premium rooms. In
NH 1 all rooms had an ensuite and the size of the room differentiated standard from premium
pricing. For NH 2 all rooms were categorised as premium rooms with a cost variance between
these premium rooms based on the vista of the room. Nursing Home 3 did not have premium
rooms. Each home operated using a volunteer workforce as well as permanent and contracted
employees. All homes had rostered and rotating shift patterns with a slight variance between
these shifts to allow for differing workplace routines.
3. Observations of nursing homes
Infrastructure
In all three nursing homes there were infrastructure challenges that hindered the care of older
adults with extreme obesity. None of the homes met all the infrastructure standards for
bariatric level support. Table 3 provides comparative information on the homes compared to
recommended international standards. Specific areas of concern related to door widths which
included internal and external doors and emergency exits corridors, and bedrooms and ensuite

facilities. There were real issues of safety around the emergency management of older adults
with extreme obesity due to the inability to evacuate residents via small doorways:
I don’t know whether I should be saying this, but they cannot be taken out from the
room-the bed can’t fit through the door [and the resident is immobile]. (Facility 2,
interviewee 8)
The sizes of rooms measured fell far below the recommended bariatric dimensions of 25.3m2
(28,29). The largest room size measured was 13.9m2 (Figure 1). These small rooms created
significant logistical and care issues for staff:
We had to work out whether it was actually practically possible to get two beds in
the room, and then extract one after we’d got her across. So the maintenance guys
measured the bed and then went into another room of the same size with two
bariatric beds, we’re dealing with wider beds, that don’t fit straight through a
doorway. So, they [resident with extreme obesity] have to be on their side, and then
lift one sideways within the room. So, they [the staff] did a trial run with two beds.
We had to remove all her furniture from the room. (Facility 2, interviewee 10)
Ceiling hoists were noted in some rooms however, none of the hoists extended into the ensuite
and none were multidirectional and would mean residents with extreme obesity would need to
be transferred into a wheelchair prior to moving them into the ensuite. There was poor access
to ensuite facilities with door width of 0.8m; the recommended width to allow bariatric access
is 1.5m. Overall the ensuite room size ranged from 1.3m2 to 4.0m2; minimum recommendations
are 4.2m2. The smallest ensuite was not used for any resident with compromised mobility due
to lack of space for healthcare assistants. All homes had toilets positioned close to a corner of
the ensuite, restricting movement of residents and caregivers assisting with the care.
Equipment
All three homes had the ability to care for fully dependent (non-mobile) residents up to the
weight of 120kg without having to procure additional equipment2. Beyond 120kg, each home
needed to acquire different pieces of equipment and all needed to procure a bariatric bed for
any resident weighing over 170kg. For some residents, the physical dimensions of the person
could mean a bariatric bed would be required for body weights considerably less than
170kg(15). This could be as low as 130kg. All homes had issues with storage space of the larger
pieces of bariatric equipment and there was limited equipment owned by the homes. Often the
more costly equipment such as a bariatric bed, was purchased by the resident. Table 4 provides
comparative information on the homes’ bariatric equipment space and storage compared to
recommended standards.

The room size would still be inadequate to safely manoeuvre the mobilisation equipment and accommodate the
necessary extra staff.

Finances
Current government funding significantly impacted on the ability of nursing homes to provide
equitable care services for older adults with extreme obesity as specified in governmentprovider contract for services purchased. The services provided by homes covered
accommodation, everyday services, core care and support, and allowances for additional care
and support. The financial risk for the provider acted as a deterrent for nursing home managers
to accept older adults with extreme obesity; safe staffing ratios and equipment procurement
were key barriers.
Nursing homes had some flexibility in determining staff to resident ratios based on government
service provision agreements that provided recommendations for safe staffing. For hospital
level care each resident was allocated 2.4 hours of caregiver and 2 hours of registered time for
high acuity residents(30). All staffing costs, however, were expected to be managed under the
constraints of the single-bed day payments.
Interviewees in each of the homes discussed staffing ratios as one of the decision-making
considerations in caring for older adults with extreme obesity:
And then we’d be looking at the staffing, and how we might need to look at the
roster [staffing rota] in terms of having the staffing on board for the time that the
person would require the cares, and you know at the certain times of the day, to
make sure we had enough people on board. (Facility 3, interviewee 7)
Whilst there was provision for extra financial support to care for bariatric residents, bariatric
equipment, a significant financial cost to procure, was considered standard equipment that a
provider must supply and therefore not funded under the government-provider contract for
services(30). This had a significant impact on individual residents, families, nursing homes and
the Regional Health Authority. Facilities often managed with the existing equipment knowing
that it was not fit for purpose:
Equipment’s an issue, and in this lady’s case we were able to – she already had very
large chair, so she already sleeps in her chair all – all night. So, she doesn’t sleep in a
bed, so the bed would never ever be wide enough for her, the bed we have at the
moment. (Facility 1, interviewee 6)
Residents and family were often expected to make additional financial contributions to care
needs because of a resident’s larger size and the financial implications for continued care:
Sometimes the families, when they’re bringing in someone that is obese,
sometimes they come with the equipment. (Facility 1, interviewee 7)
This additional resident charge is contrary to the New Zealand healthcare system which
primarily operates a free health service for users, with some long-term care services, such as
residential care, means tested with a maximum daily contribution.

Discussion
The key findings of this research identified that whilst healthcare staff are willing to care for
older adults with extreme obesity, the nursing homes were not well equipped or ready to
provide safe equitable care for this resident population. Key areas of concern for nursing
homes related to limitations in the infrastructure of current facilities, and financial barriers that
specifically related to equipment procurement and safe staffing ratios. Such concerns have
been well documented in the USA in relation to increasing prevalence of obesity in aged care
facilities(31–34). A systematic review of 28 studies examining the impact of obesity on nursing
home care in the USA identified that obesity posed major issues for the provision of nursing
home care, impacts the wider health care system, and provides challenges for nurses to deliver
high quality care (35).
Our findings indicate the need to prepare nursing homes to receive and provide safe and
equitable care for the increasing obese population. Challenges and barriers in providing safe
equitable care were partly because of outdated infrastructure, developed prior to the need for
bariatric specific care services. Nursing homes in this study were not purpose built and have
been remodelled and retrofitted. Although the adaptations meet the care needs of most
residents, none had areas specifically designed for older adults with extreme obesity. This is not
unexpected given that infrastructure specification standards are relatively new for the care of
bariatric people in New Zealand. Similar issues with inadequate infrastructure have been
identified in other countries who are having to consider the costs and issues of retrofitting
healthcare facilities to accommodate the specific needs of the bariatric population(36).
Renovating existing structures to make them ‘bariatric friendly’ appears to be the most
pragmatic step for nursing home managers to take(36). This may involve remodelling and
retrofitting existing buildings to provide extra space. Given the space constraints and high
resources required to set up newer facilities, it is pertinent for healthcare planners to renovate
the existing homes to make them suitable for this population.
Existing infrastructure poses serious safety concerns regarding the evacuation of residents with
extreme obesity during emergency situations. These concerns were primarily related to the
width of designated emergency exit doors in the resident care areas. Concerns about the
limitations of healthcare infrastructure in the emergency evacuation of those with extreme
obesity have been highlighted in accounts of emergency management processes following
disasters(37). Issues related to how the physical size of the person prevented the use of
evacuation equipment fitting through narrow stairwells(38,39), and safety concerns for the
person and the rescue staff should the person fall(38). In situations where power failures may
occur, facilities must consider the needs of people reliant on electric devices and have
adequate arrangements for backup power(40–42). Additionally, it has been suggested that
consideration needs to be given to factoring in the predicted longer evacuation time of larger
and older adults(43). Based on our findings, it is imperative that homes develop emergency
management plans and procedures that consider the weight and size of residents.
The funding model in New Zealand was developed in the 1990s and based on the resident
clinical profile of that time. The average pricing approach of the 1990s makes it difficult for

providers to manage the higher care costs associated with bariatric residents. Whilst there is
provision for extra government financial support to care for bariatric residents, bariatric
equipment, a significant financial cost to procure, was not part of the eligibility criteria for
additional funding. Therefore, the lack of bariatric equipment owned by the homes was
identified as a barrier to admission. This issue of equipment is not unique to New Zealand
nursing homes, a study by Bradway et al.(44) indicated that 81% of nursing homes lacked the
necessary bariatric equipment; the existence of ‘equipment concerns’ was associated with
reporting extreme obesity as a barrier to admission from a hospital setting. These barriers to
accessing nursing homes are common(31,44) and raise significant concerns regarding the equity
of service provision for older adults with extreme obesity. In our study, older adults with
extreme obesity were either declined admission or residents and their families carried the
financial burden of purchasing essential care equipment.
Staffing ratios for residents who require hospital level care was a financial barrier to accepting
older adults with extreme obesity. The funding for 2 hours of registered nurse and 2.4 hours of
health care assistant support per resident with high acuity needs, per day was not sufficient to
safely care for this resident population. When assessing mobilisation needs practice standards
recommend one caregiver per 45kg of patient weight when using safe moving and handling
equipment (friction reduction devices i.e. sliding sheets)(23). When applying these standards to
future bariatric residents it is expected that staffing ratios or staff time allocation needs to be
considerably higher. As older people’s BMI increases caregivers need more time than when
they perform the same task with non-obese residents(31,45–47). Kosar et al.(47) examined
whether different levels of obesity was associated with higher staffing needs for completing
activities of daily living (ADL) amongst care home residents. Higher obesity levels was
significantly associated with assistance from 2 or more staff for all ADLs except eating. With
increasing prevalence of obesity in nursing homes, funding models for staff resources that are
not adjusted for extreme obesity or do not account for additional ADL assistance need to be
amended.
Findings from this study offer the global aged care sector insights into challenges facing the
aged care sector in New Zealand. The study draws upon a large quantitative national dataset
along with data from three nursing homes with different business models and philosophies. A
limitation of this study is that the Central Region’s Technical Advisory Services Limited in New
Zealand gives no warranty that the information supplied in the InterRAI system is free from
error. However, studies from other countries utilising InterRAI datasets report consistent and
stable trends in internal consistency(48). A further limitation is that New Zealand has its own
funding model for aged care provision, and this might not directly translate to other countries
in the same way. However, international research supports the findings within this report.
Conclusion
This study is the first of its kind in New Zealand and highlights that nursing homes are not
prepared to accommodate the existing and increasing number of older adults who will require
bariatric level care. Based on this study and other international research, it is crucial that
government agencies and policy makers consider the financial implications of the increasing

need for bariatric level support within aged care, as well as the impact on individual nursing
home resources and quality of care provided. Significant investment is needed to address the
safety, equity and care concerns of older adults with extreme obesity at government and
organisational levels with considerable attention to infrastructure and funding. Further
research is needed to understand projected funding requirements of the aged care sector to
meet infrastructure and care demands.

Recommended consideration
Facilities may consider creating
larger spaces for bariatric
equipment or deciding a priori to
rent. Whenever possible and
safe, equipment frequently used
on client can be stored in a
client’s room, to facilitate access
and regular usage(22).
Examples include sliding sheets,
air-assisted devices, beds with
turning features and ceiling
lifters with repositioning slings.
Using FRDs will require a great
deal of exertion and expose the
caregiver to increased spinal
loads. To avoid this, up to 6
caregivers, which is one
caregiver per 45kg would be
needed(23).

Bedframes
and
support
surfaces

Bed width may range from 1.0m
to 1.4m(49). Preferably, facilities
must procure bariatric beds with
adjustable width. Additionally,
the length of the bed is
important, should be able to
increase up to 3 meters(29).
