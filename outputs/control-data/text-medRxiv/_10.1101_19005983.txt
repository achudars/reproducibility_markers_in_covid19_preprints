Scaffolding the ADHD Brain
Abstract
Background: Various methods have been attempted to effectively ameliorate psychiatric and
neurological conditions in children and adults. One of the attractive ideas is to develop
interventions to create a lasting, rather than only an immediate, effect. Such a concept has
important implications including increased independency of the patient, reducing the load on
the caregiver and the health system, and the economic burden at the micro and macro level.
Methods: We used a randomized double-blind active-controlled crossover study of 19
unmedicated children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), who completed
five-day executive functions training while receiving either transcranial direct current
stimulation (tDCS) or random noise stimulation (tRNS). Both stimulation protocols have
previously shown potential for inducing lasting benefits in adults, while tDCS was examined
in multiple ADHD studies and has been highlighted as a promising method for treating
neuropsychological deficits.
Results: tRNS yielded a clinical improvement as indicated by the reduced ADHD rating
scale (ADHD-RS) score from baseline, and in comparison to the changes observed in tDCS.
Moreover, the effect of brain stimulation one week after completion of treatment yielded
further improvement, suggesting a neuroplasticity-related effect. Finally, tRNS improved
working memory compared to tDCS, and a larger tRNS effect on ADHD-RS was predicted
for those patients who showed the greatest effect in working memory.
Conclusions: Our results provide a promising direction toward a novel intervention in
ADHD, which is shown to have a lasting effect via the modulating of neuroplasticity, rather
than a merely immediate effect like in current medical interventions.

Scaffolding the ADHD Brain
Introduction
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurodevelopmental
disorder in childhood, with significant negative lifetime outcomes (1). Despite proven
combinations of pharmacological and psychosocial interventions, there is still a need for
improvement of cognitive dysfunction and behavioral symptoms that are only inadequately
covered by current interventions(2). These factors highlight the pressing need for novel,
efficacious interventions.
Transcranial electrical stimulation (tES) has been suggested as a possible noninvasive
means to modify brain activity and steadily enhance behavioral and cognitive performance
(3-5). Based on promising outcomes, one form of tES (namely, trigeminal nerve stimulation)
has recently received FDA approval as a treatment for children diagnosed with ADHD who
are not currently taking prescription ADHD medication (6).
tES involves the application of a weak current (mostly 1–2 mA) to the brain via skinelectrode interface, creating an electric field that modulates neuronal activity (7). In the
present research we used two types of tES: transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and
transcranial random noise stimulation (tRNS) (3, 8, 9). tDCS is the most frequently used form
of tES (3), and is used to modulate neuronal excitability in a subtle manner without
depolarizing action potentials (8, 9). It has been suggested that the cortex beneath the anodal
electrode typically becomes more excitable whereas the cathodal site has decreased
excitability (10, 11). The delivery of tRNS uses the same equipment as tDCS to stimulate
neuronal activity at intensities that do not lead to action potentials. However, the mechanisms
by which tRNS influences brain activity are different (12, 13). In addition, in tRNS both
electrodes can be used to increase cortical excitability, either in homologous locations
bilaterally or at different regions simultaneously (14, 15). Previous studies have shown that
when several sessions of tDCS or tRNS are applied during cognitive training, the effects can

last from weeks to months (15-21). In children and adolescents, who show accelerated neural
plasticity compared to adults (22), tES combined with behavioral intervention has been
suggested as a useful tool to modulate neuroplasticity in those with atypical development to
generate long-lasting effects (23, 24). The excellent safety profile of tES makes it an even
more appealing treatment method for children and adolescents (25, 26).
One of the most influential theories of the neural basis of ADHD suggests that
deficient inhibitory control mechanisms give rise to executive dysfunction, which is likely
genetically influenced (27, 28). The neuroanatomic substrate of inhibitory control has been
imputed to the basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits (29-31). Specifically, this network links
the prefrontal cortex to the dorsal neo-striatum via excitatory glutaminergic cells, the basal
ganglia to the dorsomedial thalamus via inhibitory projections, and the thalamus back to the
prefrontal cortex via excitatory projections (32). Inhibitory control is processed during the
maturation of this circuit. Previous studies have shown that ADHD is associated with
structural and functional abnormalities within this circuit (32). Indeed, several studies have
successfully used anodal tDCS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) in children
with ADHD (33-37) (for reviews see (38, 39)). An updated meta-analysis suggests that
anodal tDCS over the left dlPFC can yield a small-to-medium effect size (a cumulative effect
size of (Ē)=0.255–0.681) on neuropsychological deficits, such as inhibition and working
memory, in ADHD (40).
To the best of our knowledge, tRNS has not yet been used in the case of ADHD, as it
is a more novel form of brain stimulation (3, 8). However, tRNS in healthy adults
successfully improved high-level cognitive functions including attentional control, with
stronger effects shown for individuals with a phenotype that indicates poorer attentional
control (41). In a small sample (n=6 per group, between-subject design) of atypically
developing children with dyscalculia, tRNS over bilateral dlPFC during numerical training

has shown positive effects on numerical training compared to sham (placebo) stimulation
(42). This preliminary result is in line with the idea that random noise can have beneficial
effects on behavior, and it is supported by earlier animal research that suggest that random
noise can allow greater opportunity for neuroplasticity (43).
The goal of our study was to compare the beneficial effects of tRNS and tDCS when
combined with executive function (EF) training in ameliorating symptoms and EF in
unmedicated school-age children with ADHD. We conducted a double-blind randomized
controlled trial with a crossover design, in which each tES method was applied for 5
consecutive days. Endurance of effects was measured one week after the end of the
intervention protocol. We used tDCS with a montage that has been deemed to be the most
successful so far, i.e., an anodal electrode over the left dlPFC and a cathodal electrode over
the contralateral supraorbital (40). With tRNS, we used a montage that placed the electrodes
above the left dlPFC and the right IFG, due both to the advantage of this neurostimulation
polarity-independent method and to its ability to yield excitatory stimulation without parallel
inhibitory effects (14). If tES combined with EF training is effective in alleviating ADHD
symptoms, it may offer many advantages as a relatively inexpensive, noninvasive therapeutic
option for school-age children with ADHD.

Scaffolding the ADHD Brain
Methods and Materials
Study Design
We conducted a randomized double-blind active-controlled crossover study of children
diagnosed with ADHD. Twenty-one children were recruited for the study, and 19 participants
completed it. Two participants were excluded from the study: one of them due to complaints
of an uncomfortable topical sensation and headaches during the tDCS protocol. The second
participant was excluded as the parents reported in the third session behavior that might meet
one of the exclusion criteria (the expression of self-harm thoughts), which was present
already two months before study participation but was not reported at screening.
The study design scheme is shown in Figure 1. A power analysis revealed that with
the obtained sample size with power=.8 and α=.05 the obtained effect size is .68, which
allows for more power to detect an effect compared to previous studies, including a recent
trial that used a between-subject design (n=32 in one group and n=30 in another) and led to
FDA approval of its use in brain stimulation to treat ADHD (6, 44). Following screening,
eligible participants were assessed at baseline and then randomized into receiving either
tDCS or tRNS first, along with computerized EF training. Each group received either tDCS
or tRNS treatment for 5 consecutive days (one treatment session each day). After a one-week
break, there was a crossover between the groups: those who received tDCS in the first week
received tRNS in the third week, while those who received tRNS in the first week received
tDCS in the third week. This allowed us to compare the different treatment in a withinsubject design, as well as to examine one-week post-treatment effects to assess lasting
effects. The assessment battery was repeated at the end of each week. The total duration of
subject participation in the study was 4 weeks. All study-related activities were conducted in
a research lab at the School of Occupational Therapy of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

Scaffolding the ADHD Brain

Figure 1. Study Design. Eligible participants with ADHD were randomized into one of two
treatment groups. Participants in both groups received 5 daily treatment sessions in Week 1,
no treatment in Week 2, 5 daily treatment sessions in Week 3, and no treatment in Week 4.
Group 1 participants received tDCS + EF training in Week 1 and tRNS + EF training in
Week 3, while Group 2 participants received the opposite. Assessments for each treatment
were conducted at baseline (t0), immediately after the first treatment (t1), and one week later
(t2). T2 served as the new baseline for the second round of treatments, with an evaluation
immediately after the second treatment (t3) and one week later (t4).
Study Population
The study included children aged 7–12 years old. Participants were recruited among children
referred to the ADHD clinic by pediatricians, general practitioners, teachers, psychologists,
or parents. All participants agreed to participate in the study (verbal assent) and their parents
gave written informed consent to the study, approved by the Helsinki Committee (IRB) of the
Hebrew University Hadassah Medical Center (Jerusalem, Israel).
The local IRB approved a total number of 100 participants for this study. For safety reasons
we were asked to summarise the data of the first 20 participants in order to assess safety and
tolerability. Upon clinical review by the study team and the IRB - if all safety criteria are met,
the study will proceed to recruit another 80 participants. That is the reason we chose to
include all 20 participants in the tDCS-tRNS arm, so safety and tolerability, as well as

efficacy, will be assessed for both methods and will allow us to revise accordingly the testing
plans for the future participants. The study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier
NCT03104972).
Inclusion criteria: Each child met the criteria for ADHD according to DSM–5 (45), using the
“gold standard” procedure as described by the American Academy of Pediatrics, and
including a semi-structured interview of the patient and parents by a specialist in pediatric
neurology and child development, a neurological examination, and ADHD-RS (15)
diagnostic questionnaires (46, 47). Each child scored above the standard clinical cutoff values
for ADHD symptoms on ADHD DSM–5 scales (45-47). All children were newly diagnosed
and drug naïve.
Exclusion criteria: Children were excluded from the study if they had one of the following: a
chronic neurological disease, epilepsy in the participant or in a first-degree relative,
intellectual disability, other chronic conditions, chronic use of medications, or other primary
psychiatric diagnosis (e.g., depression, anxiety, psychosis). The Hebrew translation of the
Kiddie-SADS-Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL) (48) was used to assess axis-I disorders in
participants according to DSM–5 criteria (48).
Prospective resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) was performed at screening
in order to rule out an unknown existence of epileptiform activity. EEG records were
standardized and recorded with gTech’s g.Recorder software67, using a 64-channel wireless
EEG cap system (g.Nautilus) with gel-based electrodes.

Outcome Measures
The primary outcome measure of the study is the total score of the ADHD-RS diagnostic
questionnaire completed by the parents (46, 47). These scales are of well-accepted validity
and reliability, regarded as standards in ADHD diagnosis and treatment effect (15). The

Scaffolding the ADHD Brain
ADHD-RS-5 contains 18 items based on the wording used to describe those items in the
DSM–5. The 18 items are presented in the context of a two-factor structure beginning with
the nine inattention (IN) symptoms followed by the nine hyperactive-impulsive (HI)
symptoms. Parents rate each of these items on a 4-point Likert frequency scale that can be
scored 0 (never or rarely), 1 (sometimes), 2 (often), or 3 (very often). IN and HI total
symptom severity scores categorically generate IN and HI symptom counts. The symptom
count for IN is determined by summing the number of IN items receiving ratings of 2 (often)
or 3 (very often). The symptom count for HI is calculated in a similar fashion. Thus, for both
IN and HI, symptom counts range from 0 to 9 in accordance with DSM–5 criteria and 18 is
the maximal possible scoring (49).
Secondary outcome measures included:
1. CGI-S (Clinical Global Impression – Severity) scale: a 3-item observer-rated scale that
measures illness severity, as assessed by the treating clinician (50). Scoring the CGI-S is
rated on a 7-point scale, with the severity of illness scale ranging from 1 (normal) to 7
(severely ill).
2. MOXO-CPT (NeuroTech Solutions Ltd): a standardized computerized test that measures
attentional performance (51). The MOXO-CPT includes four performance indices: attention,
timing, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.
3. Digit Span: a subtest of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children – Fourth edition
(WISC-IV)) that measures short-term auditory memory and attention (52).

Study Interventions
Participants completed computerized EF training along with either tDCS or tRNS brain
stimulation. Below we detail the various EF components.

Scaffolding the ADHD Brain
Computerized EF Training: Participants completed training using the ACTIVATETM training
program on tablets (53). This gamified EF training includes different tasks that target
different EF components such as working memory, cognitive flexibility, response inhibition,
and sustained attention (53). Each training session included 4 mini-games, each lasting for 5
minutes, for a total duration of 20 minutes of gameplay per session, which coincided with the
tES protocol. As our study focused on comparing the efficacy of two tES methods, rather
than on EF training per se, a detailed description of the EF training protocol is beyond the
scope of this paper, but can be found elsewhere (see (53)).

Figure 2. A treatment session of tES combined with EF training. Participants completed 20
minutes of EF training while tRNS or tDCS was delivered to them during this period.
Transcranial Electrical Stimulation
Both tDCS and tRNS were applied using semi-dry 5X5 cm electrodes using the NovoStim
device (Tech InnoSphere Eng. Ltd., Haifa). The NovoStim device is a research and
investigational device, pending FDA and medical CE approval. Stimulation was delivered for

20 minutes each session, while participants completed the cognitive training (Figure 2). The
total stimulation time for each tES protocol was 100 minutes (5 sessions of 20 min each).
tDCS. The current was set to 0.75mA based on previous computational modelling of tDCS in
children and is estimated to equal that of approximately 1.5mA in adults (54). Ramp-up and
ramp-down durations were 30 seconds each. These durations were chosen after considering
the parameters that would influence current distribution and density at the site of stimulation,
such as thinner scalp, less cerebrospinal fluid, and smaller head size of the pediatric
population (54). A similar dosage of tDCS was well tolerated by the children and was not
associated with adverse effects (26). The anodal electrode was positioned above the left
dlPFC (F3 based on the International 10-20 system), while the cathodal electrode was placed
over the right supraorbital (Fp2).
tRNS. Stimulation was applied at an amplitude of 0.75mA of tRNS over the left dlPFC and
the right inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), attached under designated electrode positions (F3-F8
based on the International 10-20 system) of the tES cap. These stimulation locations were
chosen based on their involvement in executive control and inhibition processes (29, 30, 32).
Ramp-up and ramp-down durations were the same as in the tDCS condition.

Data Analysis
To examine treatment effects, we used linear mixed effects (LME) models, which account for
within-subject correlations more optimally compared to Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and
automatically handle missing values, allowing maximum use of available data (55). We used
the R-package nlme (56) to perform the LME analysis with maximized log-likelihood on the
outcome measures. We examined outcomes immediately post-treatment and one week later
for each stimulation type, and included stimulation type (tDCS, tRNS) and time (immediately
after treatment and one week post-treatment) as predictors. We included baseline

performance in our model as a covariate, rather than use a subtraction score (i.e., posttreatment minus baseline), as the former allows for a better adjustment for minor differences
in the pre-treatment means, while the latter contains measurement error from both the
baseline performance and the post-treatment score and is also negatively correlated with
baseline performance because of the measurement error (57, 58). We verified that the
residuals were normally distributed using a q-q plot and the Shapiro–Wilk normality test. The
only exception was the MOXO-CPT residuals, which were not normally distributed; we
therefore applied the Tukey ladder of powers transformation, which is recommended in this
case (59).
We also tested for the inclusion of an interaction term in our analysis. In our primary
outcome, ADHD-RS, the interaction between stimulation type and time was not significant
(β=0.14, SE=0.18, t(35)= 0.78, p=0.44). A model comparison showed no benefit from a more
complex model, favoring the more parsimonious model, which included the main effects of
stimulation and time (chi-squared test=0.66, p=0.41). We therefore report this parsimonious
model also for the secondary outcome measures. However, as with the other measures, the
inclusion of the interaction term between stimulation and time was not significant.

Results
Side Effects and Safety Issues
There were 61 records of side effects reported, none of which were considered clinically
significant. Table 1 summarizes these findings as a function of brain stimulation. As can be
seen, tRNS yielded fewer reports of side effects. This finding is in line with the relevant
literature on adults that highlights tRNS as a more comfortable neurostimulation method in
comparison to tDCS (60, 61).

Changes in ADHD Symptoms
For the primary outcome, we predicted the ADHD-RS total score post-treatment immediately
after the intervention (tRNS/tDCS) and one week later, while covarying for the baseline
score. The analysis revealed a main effect of stimulation type, indicating greater
improvement for tRNS than for tDCS (β=-.42 (SE=.18), B=-1.98 (SE=.87), t(35)=-2.28,
p=.028, Table 2). The main effect of time, i.e., immediately after the end of the intervention
to one week later, showed a further improvement one week after the end of the treatment (β=.19 (SE=.09), B=-1.78 (SE=.86), t(35)=-2.07, p=.045). In terms of improvement from
baseline, tRNS yielded a mean improvement of 3.65 points [95% CI (1.79, 5.51)], while
tDCS yielded a mean improvement of 1.52 points [95% CI (-.3, 3.35)].

Changes in Attentional Performance
The results for the MOXO-CPT subscales and CGI-S (see Tables S1–S5) did not show a
significant post-treatment effect of stimulation type (all ps>0.44), aside from the MOXO
timing index, which showed larger changes following tRNS compared with those seen
following tDCS (B=1.92 (SE=.91), t(47)=2.11, p=.04). However, as a transformation was
applied to the outcome score due to the distribution of the residuals (see the Methods
section), this result should be interpreted with caution, although the effect of stimulation was
significant also without data transformation (β=.25 (SE=.12), B=0.52 (SE=.25), t(47)=2.07,
p=.044).

Changes in Working Memory and Short-Term Memory
Performance on the digit span subscale of the WISC (total score of forward and backward
span) after the intervention showed similar results to those of the primary outcome (ADHDRS), with a significant effect of stimulation, favoring tRNS over tDCS (β=.34 (SE=.14),
B=1.07 (SE=.44), t(50)=2.44, p=.018). While the effect of time was not significant,
descriptively it showed a positive, rather than a negative, slope, indicating that a deterioration
due to the time elapsed from the end of the intervention did not occur (β=.04 (SE=.068),
B=.27 (SE=.43), t(50)=.64, p=.53).
We further examined whether the improvement in the post-treatment digit span test
reflects a modification in working memory or in short-term memory, as assessed by a

significantly better performance in the backward digit span only, compared to tDCS (Table

Examining the Link between Clinical and Cognitive Changes by Brain Stimulation
Next, we examined whether the improvement in the ADHD-RS score under the tRNS
protocol depends on the changes in WM performance (the backward digit span score). To do
so, we ran a moderation analysis and predicted the post-treatment ADHD-RS score by
stimulation type and the post-treatment backward digit span score, while controlling for the
ADHD-RS and backward digit span scores at baseline. This analysis revealed a trend toward
a significant interaction between stimulation type and the post-treatment backward digit span
score (β=-.41 (SE=.23), B=-1.01 (SE=.56), t(53)=-1.81, p=.075, Table 4). A simple slopes
analysis revealed that this trend stemmed from a significant improvement in ADHD-RS for
tRNS vs. tDCS in those who had showed the largest improvement in the backward digit span
test (β=-.62 (SE=.29), B=-2.91 (SE=1.36), t(53)=-2.14, p=.037).

Scaffolding the ADHD Brain
Discussion
In this study we examined the effect of tRNS and tDCS on the clinical and cognitive
outcomes of children with ADHD during 5 days of executive function training. The most
notable results in our study are the ADHD-RS improvement of tRNS relative to baseline and
tDCS. These promising results on the tRNS protocol support those of several studies in
healthy young adults (33-37), including a recent meta-analysis (40). Importantly, the results
showed a further significant improvement 7 days after the end of the treatment, mirroring a
similar lasting tRNS effect in previous studies on healthy adults (15, 16, 19, 20, 62). We
suggest that the observed effects in the present study reflect our approach not to use brain
stimulation alone, but to combine it with cognitive training in order to induce changes in the
associated neural system via neuroplasticity (24). This approach differs from other attempts
to treat individuals with ADHD using drugs or brain stimulation alone.
The success of our approach is further supported by a tRNS effect on the MOXO
timing index score, which reflects cognitive processing speed, i.e., the speed at which a
person is able to perceive and react to stimuli in the environment (63). More importantly, we
observed a tRNS effect on the backward digit span test, which measures WM capacity. This
last effect was expected given that our cognitive training targeted WM as one of the
executive functions that have been shown to be impaired in children with ADHD (64).
Notably, the effect of tRNS vs. tDCS was restricted to WM and did not extend to the forward
digit span test, which does not measure WM. Moreover, a greater improvement of tRNS in
ADHD-RS was predicted by a greater improvement in the backward digit span test from
baseline, while the interaction between brain stimulation and WM in predicting ADHD-RS
was marginally significant.
There are a few differences that are worth emphasizing when comparing our approach
to transcranial electrical stimulation to that of McGough et al. (44), whose recent promising

findings on trigeminal nerve stimulation as a treatment for ADHD has received FDA
approval (6). Our results are based on lower stimulation intensity (.75mA vs. 2–4mA) and
shorter treatment duration (100min vs. 13,440min in total), and they show persistent and even
increasing improvement after treatment, indicating plasticity-related effects. This is in
contrast to the short-lived immediate improvement and significant deterioration one week
after the end of the treatment associated with the form of tES reported in (44). Moreover, the
estimated effect size in our study on ADHD-RS is higher than the one reported in (44)
(estimated Cohen’s d=.95 on an 18 points scale, and .73 on a 54 points scale vs. .51). This
difference is less likely to be due to an inflated effect size due to an underpowered design
(65) as the experimental design in our study was even more suitable for detecting the
observed effect size (Cohen’s d=.67 in the present design vs. Cohen’s d=.72 in (44)).
However, two additional differences are noteworthy. First, given that the effect of
tRNS alone does not yield a lasting behavioral effect (16, 66), our approach is likely to
require that brain stimulation be combined with cognitive training in order to induce lasting
effects. By contrast, the approach in (44) is based on brain stimulation during sleep. The
requirement of active cognitive engagement vs. passive involvement of the patient is
important, and caregivers/clinics will have to consider these options given the length of the
treatment and the commitment constraints of the caregiver.
In addition, in the present study we chose to compare the effect of tRNS vs. tDCS,
rather than vs. sham stimulation. In our view such an approach is more rigorous as it
compares the effect of two stimulation protocols that at the theoretical and the empirical level
had an a priori likelihood of leading to successful treatment. Therefore, the obtained results
are expected to be stronger when compared to sham stimulation. However, we would like to
acknowledge a potential criticism that tDCS, in contrast to sham stimulation, might yield
impairment, rather than improvement. While a future study that includes a sham group is

needed to exclude this possibility with great confidence, the criticism is likely unfounded
given the accumulated evidence that suggests a beneficial effect of tDCS on ADHD
neuropsychological deficits under the montage we used (33-37). Future research that
compares different approaches to intervention, and the mechanisms these interventions are
acting on, will advance our understanding of and decision-making on the most promising
approaches to ADHD treatment.
In this regard, a recent study in mice that aimed to advance the understanding of the
effect of tRNS on the developing brain has revealed that delivery of identical tRNS current
density and duration per day over multiple sessions (in this case 9 sessions, twice a week) to
the prefrontal cortex reduces GAD 65/67 but not vesicular glutamate transporter 1. This
effect was maximal in the location immediately beneath the electrode but not in a deeper
location (67). Such findings support our suggestion that tRNS impacts neuroplastic
mechanisms and, at least in mice, involves the GABAergic system. Further work in humans
and animals could shed further light on the mechanisms involved, and on how tRNS can
ameliorate ADHD symptoms and potentially other clinical conditions.
