ABSTRACT

Objective: Prompted by international targets for elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV)
infection, we performed a cross-sectional observational study of adults with chronic HBV
(CHB) infection in South Africa, characterising individuals with HBV monoinfection vs. those
coinfected with HBV/HIV, to evaluate the impact of therapy and to guide improvements in
clinical care as guidelines for antiviral therapy change over time.
Design: We prospectively recruited 115 adults with CHB, over a period of one year at a
university hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. HIV coinfection was present in 39 (34%)
subjects. We recorded cross-sectional demographic, clinical and laboratory data.
Results: Adults with HBV monoinfection were comparable to those with HBV/HIV coinfection
in terms of age, sex and body mass. HBeAg-positive status was more common among those
with HIV coinfection (p=0.01). However, compared to HBV/HIV coinfection, HBV monoinfected
patients were less likely to have had assessment with elastography (p<0.0001) and less likely
to be on antiviral treatment (p<0.0001). The HBV monoinfected group was more likely to have
detectable HBV viraemia (p=0.04), and features suggesting underlying liver disease including
moderate/severe thrombocytopaenia (p=0.007), elevated bilirubin (p=0.004), and APRI score
>2 (p=0.02). Three cases of hepatocellular carcinoma were documented, all in patients with
HBV monoinfection.
Conclusion: In this setting, individuals with HBV monoinfection are disadvantaged in terms of
clinical assessment and appropriate antiviral therapy compared to those with HIV coinfection,
associated with relatively worse liver health. Enhanced advocacy, education, resources and
infrastructure are required to optimise interventions for CHB.

INTRODUCTION
The burden of chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) in southern Africa is high, and in this
setting the distribution overlaps with populations in which HIV infection is endemic [1]. Due to
high rates of coinfection, and the overlap in antiviral regimens, there is a pressing need to
develop an enhanced understanding of the interplay between these infections, and to capitalise
on opportunities for deploying existing HIV infrastructure to improve HBV diagnosis, clinical care
and prevention. International Sustainable Development Goals set a target for elimination of HBV
as a public health problem by the year 2030 [2]. Developing insights into the characteristics and
outcomes of chronic HBV (CHB) monoinfection and HBV/HIV coinfection will underpin improved
strategies for monitoring, prognostication, patient stratification and therapy. Changes in
recommendations for combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimens for HIV infection
should consider the individual and public health impact of therapy on individuals who are coinfected with HBV, particularly in the co-endemic populations of sub-Saharan Africa.

A traditional paradigm suggests that individuals with HBV/HIV coinfection might have a worse
prognosis from chronic liver disease than those with HBV monoinfection, typically linked with
higher rates of HBeAg-positivity and higher viral loads [1,3], lower CD4+ T cell counts,
increased incidence of liver fibrosis [4] and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), higher rates of
vertical HBV transmission, and higher overall mortality [5]. However, this picture is not
consistent between populations (even within individual studies [6]) and the interplay between
viruses may be affected by specific characteristics of the host or viral population [7], and by
changes in treatment guidelines over time.

Lamivudine (3TC) and tenofovir (most commonly in the form of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate,
TDF) are nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) agents with established track
records of safety and tolerability in both HIV and HBV infection. Long-term 3TC use is
hampered by a high rate of selection of resistance [8], while TDF is favoured as the genetic
barrier to resistance is high [9]. Following publication of the START trial in 2015, HIV treatment
is now initiated irrespective of clinical or immunological status [10]. This practice is now
enshrined in ‘90-90-90’ targets, seeking to have 90% of cases diagnosed, 90% of these on
treatment, and 90% of these virologically suppressed [11].
TDF is one of the recommended choices for the NRTI backbone of first line cART for HIV [12].
In South Africa, second line NRTI combinations include TDF + 3TC, or TDF + FTC, or AZT +

3TC, depending on the patient’s first line regimen [13]. South African ART guidelines
recommend HBsAg testing for patients switching from a TDF containing regimen to avoid acute
hepatitis flares after TDF withdrawal; in those testing HBsAg positive, TDF is continued as a
component of the second line cART regimen. Thus the majority of HIV-positive individuals with
HBV coinfection receive treatment with TDF, whether as a component of routine first-line
therapy, or incorporated into second-line regimens.

In contrast, for HBV monoinfection, TDF is prescribed only for a subset of patients, based on
algorithms that incorporate assessment of the patient (age and sex), virologic status (HBV DNA
viral load) and the presence of underlying fibrotic or inflammatory liver disease (ALT,
elastography score, ultrasound appearance, biopsy results) [14–16]. WHO targets for 2030 aim
for 90% of HBV cases to be diagnosed, and for 80% of those eligible for treatment to be
receiving it [17]. However, only a small minority of those living with CHB are currently aware of
their status [18], patient stratification and monitoring using laboratory and radiological
approaches is not accessible in many settings [18]. Current assessment therefore misses a high
proportion of patients who should be treated [19].

Recognising the need for improved characterisation of CHB infection, both alone and in
combination with HIV coinfection, we have undertaken a cross-sectional analysis of adults with
CHB in an urban cohort in South Africa. We set out to explore the differences between
individuals with monoinfection and coinfection, and to compare rates and outcomes of antiviral
therapy, with the aim of improving local practice, and with the wider potential to inform future
therapeutic guidelines.

METHODS
Clinical cohort
We recruited adults with CHB infection, with or without HIV coinfection, attending routine clinical
follow-up in hepatology and infectious diseases outpatient clinics at Tygerberg Hospital, a
tertiary referral hospital in Cape Town. Healthcare workers at local HIV and primary care clinics
within the referral area are encouraged to send all patients diagnosed with HIV-HBV coinfection
to the Tygerberg clinic for counselling and baseline investigations including clinical assessment,
laboratory tests and elastography. Surrounding clinical centres also refer adults testing HBsAgpositive for assessment and follow-up in the Division of Gastroenterology. Patients are followed
at the clinic at intervals according to the baseline findings, typically attending at intervals of six

months. Thus, our cohort represents prevalent chronic disease in this community, rather than
new incident infections. Cases were defined as being HBsAg-positive (having been under
follow-up for a period of >6 months) and were recruited into a cross-sectional cohort (OxfordSouth Africa Hepatitis Cohort, ‘OxSA-Hep’), commencing July 2018. We here present the
results of a planned interim analysis of data after 12 months of recruitment.

We recorded treatment with antiviral therapy at the time of recruitment to the study, routine
clinical laboratory data (including serological markers of HBV infection, creatinine, liver function
tests and platelet count), and documented elastography scores when the patient had been
assessed by fibroscan. We recorded data in a LabKey database [20] using a unique
pseudonymised patient ID number.

Generation and analysis of laboratory data
Biochemical and serological data were generated on the Cobas 6000 series e601 module
analyzer (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Germany), including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and
aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and serum bilirubin (BR). Platelet counts were obtained using
the Advia 2120i analyzer (Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics Inc, USA). HIV and HBV viral loads
were measured using Cobas Ampliprep/Taqman tests (Roche Molecular Diagnostics, the
Netherlands).

We defined the upper limit of normal (ULN) for ALT as 19 U/L for females and 30 U/L for males
[16,21], ULN for AST as 40 U/L, ULN for BR as 17 mmol/L. We calculated liver fibrosis scores,
AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI) and Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) as follows:

● APRI = (AST / ULN AST) / (Platelet count x 100)
● FIB-4 = (Age in years x AST) / (Platelet count * √ALT)
We used thresholds of FIB-4 >3.25 (97% specificity, and positive predictive value of 65% for
advanced liver fibrosis [22]), and APRI >2 (91% specific for cirrhosis [23,24]).

We measured renal function based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as follows:

● 186 x (creatinine (µmol/L)/88.4)-1.154 x (age in years)-0.203 x (0.742 if female) x (1.210 if
black) [25].

Normal renal function is defined as eGFR ≥ 90 ml/min/1.73m2. We grouped together individuals
with renal impairment, defined as chronic kidney disease (CKD) Stage II (eGFR 60-89 ml/min)

or Stage III (eGFR 30-59 ml/min). We defined moderate/severe thrombocytopaenia as a platelet
count <75 x 103/μl [26].
Elastography
Elastography to quantify liver stiffness (an assessment of inflammation and/or fibrosis) is not
undertaken consistently in this setting, but is performed in a subset of patients at the discretion
of the clinical team using the Fibroscan 402 (Echosens, Paris, France). Elastography scores are
not reliable in individuals with a high body mass index or during pregnancy, and would not be
undertaken in these circumstances. Due to the cross-sectional nature of the cohort, we
recorded elastography scores at a single time point only.

Treatment indications and outcomes
We have referred to HBV treatment recommendations published by the UK National Institute for
Clinical Excellence (NICE) [21], the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) [15],
and South African national guidelines [16]. All concur in advising tenofovir or entecavir as firstline options, and recommend that stratification for therapy should be based on laboratory
parameters, on the presence and extent of existing liver disease assessed by imaging and/or
biopsy, and on consideration of other individual clinical and demographic factors.

Due to resource constraints, liver biopsy is rarely undertaken in this setting and we have
primarily used laboratory parameters to assess treatment eligibility. South African guidelines
suggest consideration of therapy for individuals who are HBeAg-positive with HBV DNA
>20,000 IU/ml and ALT above ULN, or who are HBeAg-negative with HBV DNA >2,000 IU/ml
and ALT above ULN, with the aim of achieving durable suppression of HBV DNA to low or
undetectable levels and normalisation of ALT [16]. Individuals with HIV coinfection are routinely
treated with first line cART that includes HBV-active agents [13]. In practice in this setting, TDF
is therefore first line therapy for CHB, both in the presence and absence of HIV infection.

Statistical analysis
We analysed data using GraphPad prism v 8.0.1. For continuous variables, we used Mann
Whitney Test; for categorical variables we used Fisher’s Exact Test. Linear regression was used
to assess associations between two continuous variables. For multivariate analysis, we
performed multivariate logistic regression using bayesglm function of the R package.

Ethics
Ethics approval was provided by University of Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (ref.
OXTREC 01-18) and Stellenbosch University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC ref.
N17/01/013). All participants provided written valid informed consent. A STROBE statement to
support the quality of this observational study is available (Suppl. Table 1).

RESULTS
Representation of HBV monoinfection and HIV/HBV coinfection in an adult cohort
We recruited 115 adults with HBV infection (57% male), representing 76 adults with HBV
monoinfection (66%) and 39 with HBV/HIV coinfection (34%) (Fig 1; Table 1). The full metadata
for this cohort are available in Suppl. Table 2. The majority of participants were of South African
origin (98/115, 85%; Suppl. Fig 1). There was no significant difference in sex, age or body
weight between the monoinfected and coinfected groups (p=0.24, 0.51, and 0.23 respectively;
Table 1). HBeAg-positive status was significantly more common among individuals with HIV
coinfection (39%) compared to HBV monoinfected individuals (14%); (p=0.01; Table 1; Fig 2A).

Antiviral therapy and virologic outcomes in HBV monoinfection vs HIV/HBV coinfection
Duration of antiviral therapy was recorded for 36 individuals with HBV monoinfection and 37
individuals with HIV coinfection (median 38 vs. 62 months, respectively; p=0.1). As anticipated,
based on HIV treatment guidelines [13], a significantly greater proportion of the coinfected group
was on antiviral therapy compared to the monoinfected group (97% vs. 47% respectively,
p<0.0001; Fig 2B; Table 2). Accordingly, HBV DNA was more likely to be suppressed below the
limit of detection in coinfected than monoinfected patients (53% vs 30%, respectively; p=0.04;
Fig 2C; Table 2), and absolute values for HBV DNA viral load (VL) were also significantly lower
in the coinfected group than the monoinfected (p=0.04; Suppl Fig 2A; Table 2).

In the HBV/HIV coinfected group, 38/39 adults were on antiviral therapy that included HBVactive agents (TDF and/or 3TC); one patient was not on therapy. HIV VL data were available for
35/38, being undetectable in 22/35 (63%), and detectable but <1000 RNA copies/ml in a further
5/35 (14%). Overall, suppression of HIV viraemia was associated with suppression of HBV
viraemia (p=0.01, Fig 2D; Suppl Fig 2B). Among individuals with undetectable HIV VL, HBV
DNA was still detectable in 6/21 (29%). Among these, one was being treated with 3TC as the
only HBV-active agent, with HBV DNA VL 1.0 x 105 IU/ml. Suppression of HIV viraemia
suggests adherence to cART, and the high HBV viral load may therefore be consistent with 3TC

resistance.

The other five were receiving TDF-based combination therapy, making drug

resistance a less likely explanation for HBV viraemia (HBV VL 20-5444 IU/ml). Treatment start
date was ≥15 months prior to the date of recruitment (recorded in all 6 cases), making it unlikely
that HBV viraemia was detectable because therapy had only recently been instituted.
Proportion of untreated HBV monoinfected patients who meet treatment criteria
We reviewed the data for 38 HBV monoinfected individuals off therapy to determine the
proportion of these who met treatment criteria. Using South African guidelines [16], 8/38 (21%)
were treatment eligible, comprising individuals with ALT >ULN of whom four were HBeAgpositive with HBV DNA >20,000 IU/ml, and four were HBeAg-negative with HBV DNA >2,000
IU/ml.

Prevalence of liver disease: laboratory data
We assessed laboratory data and elastography scores as markers for underlying liver disease.
There was no significant difference in ALT or AST between monoinfected vs. coinfected
individuals (p=0.8 and p=0.6, respectively). For BR, the absolute values were significantly
higher in those with monoinfection (p=0.004), and a higher proportion of the population had an
elevated value in the moninfected group (23%) vs. the coinfected group (8%), although this
difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.06); Fig 3A,C. Thrombocytopaenia can be
an indicator of chronic liver disease as a result of a variety of mechanisms, including splenic
sequestration and myelosuppression [26]. Strikingly, all the individuals with moderate/severe
thrombocytopaenia were in the HBV monoinfected group, representing 16% of this group vs.
0% in those with coinfection (p=0.007); Fig 3B,D, suggesting a subgroup of individuals with
established liver disease.

We calculated fibrosis scores from laboratory data, finding a significantly higher proportion of
the HBV monoinfected group had APRI scores predictive of cirrhosis (p=0.02; Fig 4A). There
was a trend in the same direction, although non-significant, for FIB-4 (p=0.1, Fig 4B).

Prevalence of liver disease: elastography and clinical data
Due to limited clinical availability, elastography is not routinely undertaken, and data were only
available in 48/115 patients (42%). Individuals with HBV/HIV coinfection were more likely to

have been assessed by elastography, in whom it was undertaken in 35/39 cases (90%)
compared to only 13/76 (17%) of individuals with HBV monoinfection (p<0.0001; Table 1). The
median elastography score was higher in the HBV monoinfected group compared to those with
coinfection (7.8 kPa vs 5.8 kPa), and a greater proportion of the HBV monoinfected group met
the stringent treatment threshold of 6 kPa [21] (9/13 (64%) monoinfected vs. 16/35 (47%)
coinfected patients. Neither of these differences reached statistical significance (p=0.2, in both
cases), but this comparison is limited by small numbers in the monoinfected group. There was
no difference in ALT values between the monoinfected vs coinfected patients with documented
fibroscan scores (median ALT 22 vs. 23 U/L, respectively), suggesting that elastography was
not systematically undertaken for HBV monoinfected patients with biochemical evidence of
inflammatory liver disease.

We reviewed clinical records for complications reported by specialist doctors in 112/115 cases
(data not available for three patients). Among these, 20/112 (18%) had hepatic complications of
HBV infection, including 18 cases of cirrhosis (16% prevalence) and 3 cases of HCC (3%
prevalence); two patients had both cirrhosis and HCC. All HCC cases occurred in the context of
HBV monoinfection. The prevalence of hepatic complications was almost twice as high in HBV
monoinfection (15/73; 21%) compared to HBV/HIV coinfection (5/39; 13%), although this
difference did not reach statistical significance due to small numbers in each group (p=0.1;
Table 1).

Evidence of renal dysfunction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) can arise in association with HIV infection, and is also a potential
side effect of TDF therapy [27]. Therefore, we examined this cohort for the presence of CKD
based on calculation of eGFR, available for 111 individuals. Due to small numbers, we grouped
together CKD stage II and III, finding a prevalence of 16/111 (14%). There was no difference in
the prevalence of CKD between individuals with HBV monoinfection vs. HBV/HIV coinfection
(CKD prevalence 9/72 (13%) vs. 7/39 (18%), respectively, p=0.6), and no evidence of
nephrotoxicity among those on TDF (CKD present in 9/65 (14%) of treated individuals, vs. 7/43
(16%) of untreated; p=0.8). While we cannot exclude the possibility that selection bias for
treatment might mean TDF is more frequently started in individuals with normal renal function,
these results are nevertheless reassuring in excluding any significant on-treatment
nephrotoxicity.

Multivariate analysis
Based on small numbers, we did not anticipate multivariate analysis to demonstrate many
significant variables, but undergoing assessment by elastography and being prescribed antiviral
therapy remained significant on multivariate analysis (Tables 1 and 2, footnotes).

DISCUSSION
Context and primary conclusions
Developing a detailed understanding of the characteristics of CHB, and the clinical interplay with
co-endemic HIV, is important to drive forward improvements in care provision, with gains to be
made both for individuals and populations. Although successful HBV vaccination campaigns are
well established, modelling studies predict long timeframes to elimination [28,29], and
programmes to enhance diagnosis and treatment will therefore be crucial in the decade ahead.

The traditional paradigm suggests that patients with HBV/HIV coinfection may have worse
outcomes than those with HBV monoinfection, and we confirmed a significantly higher
prevalence of HBeAg-positive status in those with HIV coinfection, characteristically associated
with higher HBV viral loads and acceleration of inflammatory or fibrotic liver disease. However,
our data indicate that the monoinfected group is disadvantaged compared to those with
coinfection, evidenced by the significant association between monoinfection and lower rates of
access to appropriate clinical surveillance, lower rates of antiviral treatment (even among those
who meet treatment criteria), and more evidence of liver disease (hyperbilirubinaemia,
thrombocytopaenia and elevated APRI). A previous report from the same setting also
documents elevated rates of severe fibrosis in HBV monoinfected compared to their HBV/HIV
coinfected counterparts [30], although this observation is not consistent as another African study
found elevated APRI scores were more likely in patients with coinfection [4].

In our cohort, there was no difference in the prevalence of elevated hepatic transaminases (ALT
and AST) between monoinfected and coinfected patient groups. It is important to observe that
significant evidence of progressive liver disease can be present even in the absence of
abnormalities in liver enzymes. This highlights the lack of sensitivity of liver function tests as
biomarkers, and uncertainties around appropriate thresholds for ‘normal’ in different populations
highlights the need for clinical surveillance that incorporates other markers .

The worse overall outcomes among the population with HBV monoinfection may stem from the
sustained neglect of HBV infection as a clinical and public health problem [18], relatively
complex algorithms for HBV treatment stratification, and less consistent and rigorous access to
tenofovir monotherapy [31], and may also be influenced by a referral bias. HCC can arise
independent of liver fibrosis [16], and therefore even among HBV-infected individuals with no
objective evidence of inflammatory or fibrotic liver disease, there is a potential for the
emergence of malignancy. Irrespective of the potential bias in the nature of the patients we have
been able to assess, our data suggest that adults with HBV monoinfection may be coming to
clinical care too late, underlining a pressing need for simplified, scalable approaches to HBV
diagnosis as well as treatment [32].

HBV suppression on therapy
Despite the immunological defect associated with HIV infection and the higher prevalence of
HBeAg+ status in this group, HBV viraemia can be successfully suppressed in the majority of
coinfected patients using conventional TDF-based cART regimens. However, even on
appropriate antiviral therapy, over a quarter of patients still had detectable HBV viraemia. This
may be explained by sub-optimal adherence to therapy, pharmacokinetics (drug absorption,
levels within liver tissue), or drug resistance, and the long timeframes over which HBV viraemia
may decline on therapy [33]. Even on treatment, HBV is more likely to be suppressed in the
context of HIV co-infection, perhaps related to better support and education around treatment
adherence, or potentially to therapy with more than one HBV active agent (TDF+3TC) in the coinfected group. Careful clinical surveillance is therefore important even in the context of
treatment, and there is a need to consider the role of dual HBV therapy and the potential impact
of TDF resistance [8,34].

The group of adults with HBV monoinfection whom we assessed according to criteria for
therapy points to a burden of infection that is currently untreated, but the patients attending
hospital clinics for assessment do not necessarily represent the wider HBV population. Broad
community-level surveillance would be required to capture a true picture of the proportion of
adults with HBV who meet current treatment criteria. There is also a need for critical appraisal of
guidelines, with a view to considering whether thresholds for therapy are appropriate in different
settings.

Changes to cART regimens with influence on HBV therapy

Changes to cART recommendations are developing, based on the success of dual therapy with
dolutegravir (DTG) regimens, both in the context of prior viraemic suppression [35] and for
salvage after failure of first-line treatment [36,37]. DTG/3TC is a common combination, but other
regimens do not contain any HBV active agents, (e.g. DTG combined with rilpivirine (RPV) [38],
emtricitabine (FTC) [39], or ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPVr) [37]). These regimens have not
yet been robustly evaluated in African populations, and are deemed inappropriate in the context
of HBV coinfection [40], although there are data demonstrating the efficacy of TDF/FTC in
mediating HBV suppression [41]. As dual therapy combinations enter clinical practice in Africa,
enhanced awareness and scrutiny will be critical to ensure that HBV-positive individuals are
diagnosed and treated with appropriate HBV-active agents, and that there is caution regarding
the potential for selection of HBV drug resistance on DTG/3TC treatment.

Drug resistance
We identified a patient with phenotypic evidence of 3TC-resistant HBV in our cohort, congruent
with evidence for the consistent selection of resistance among individuals on 3TC monotherapy
[42], and in keeping with another African study that documented a high prevalence of 3TC
resistance among coinfected patients [4]. Tenofovir resistance is less well substantiated, and
can be difficult to confirm phenotypically due to the slow rate of HBV DNA suppression after
institution of therapy [26]; however, there are reports confirming the potential for resistance to
this agent (as previously reviewed [8,34]). In the longer term, generation of HBV sequence data
will allow us to determine the prevalence of drug resistance mutations, as well as generating
insights into the molecular epidemiology and pathogenesis of CHB [7].

Caveats and limitations
We have studied a small cohort, representing a distinct geographical setting and focusing on
clinical care delivery within the specific environment of a tertiary care university hospital, which
benefits from enhanced resource and infrastructure compared to many other healthcare
settings. Even in this context, missing data are problematic. Assessment with elastography is
not consistently deployed, and serological markers are expensive, and not routinely undertaken
at each clinic visit. We were unable to determine specific treatment duration for a proportion of
the patients studied, adding to uncertainty about exposure to antiviral therapy in HBV and
HBV/HIV infected groups. Our data exemplify a ‘real world’ setting and highlight genuine
complex day-to-day clinical challenges of managing these patients.

Our study may be influenced by referral bias: patients with more advanced pathology are most
likely to be diagnosed and referred for tertiary-level follow-up, potentially leading us to overestimate liver disease in those with HBV monoinfection. Outside this specific setting, the
majority of cases of HBV monoinfection are undiagnosed, and even those with a diagnosis are
infrequently under routine surveillance, less likely to be stratified for treatment, and rarely
receive a regular supply of appropriate therapy supported by clinical monitoring; on these
grounds, our cohort significantly under-represents the true burden of liver disease. However,
accepting the referral bias, head-to-head comparison of comparable monoinfected and
coinfected groups under clinical surveillance within the same setting consistently suggest a
treatment advantage in the coinfected group, and a risk of progression of liver pathology among
those with HBV monoinfection.

We have used platelet count as a marker of liver disease, but this is a non-specific approach, as
thrombocytopaenia has diverse potential causes. The sensitivity and specificity of APRI and
FIB-4 varies between settings, and further evaluation is specifically required in African
populations [43]. We were unable to apply other fibrosis scores, such as

gamma-

glutamyltranspeptidase-to-platelet ratio (GPR) [43,44], as the extended panel of liver function
tests required is not routinely collected.

We have taken a cross-sectional view, from which long-term outcomes can only be extrapolated
with caution. We have not been able to capture data regarding important influences on HBV and
HIV viral loads, including compliance with treatment and the presence of antiviral resistance.
HBV genotype data are not available for this cohort, but are known to have a role in disease
progression, and may add future insights [7,45].

Conclusions
High standards of provision of HIV services, with consistent access to diagnosis, surveillance
and tenofovir-based treatment, are advantageous in delivering a high standard of clinical care
for those with HBV coinfection. The majority of HBV monoinfected patients remain undiagnosed,
but - even among those who know their status and are under follow-up - there remains a gap in
care provision, rendering them susceptible to long-term liver complications. In order to make
progress towards 2030 elimination goals, service providers should capitalise on the existing
infrastructure and investment deployed for HIV as both a precedent and a foundation for
improved clinical care for HBV infection.
