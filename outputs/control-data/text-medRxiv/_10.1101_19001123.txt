Abstract
Objective: DNA methylation (DNAm) is associated with environmental risk factors for major
depressive disorder (MDD) but has not yet been tested for its ability to discriminate individuals
with MDD from unaffected individuals. Methods: Using penalized regression based on genomewide CpG methylation, we trained a DNAm risk score of MDD (DNAm-RS) in 1,223 cases and
1,824 controls and tested in a second independent sample of 363 prevalent cases and 1,417
controls. Using DNA from 1,607 unaffected individuals, we tested whether DNAm-RS could
discriminate the 190 incident cases of lifetime MDD from the 1,417 individuals who remained
unaffected at follow-up. Results: A weighted linear combination of 196 CpG sites were derived
from the training sample to form a DNAm-RS. The DNAm-RS explained 1.75% of the variance
in MDD risk in an independent case-control sample and significantly predicted future incident
episodes of MDD at follow up (R2=0.52%). DNAm-RS and MDD polygenic risk scores together
additively explained 3.99% of the variance in prevalent MDD. The DNAm-RS was also
significantly associated with lifestyle factors associated with MDD, including smoking status
(β=0.440, p=<2x10-16) and alcohol use (β=0.092, p=9.85x10-5). The DNAm-RS remained
significantly associated with MDD after adjustment for these environmental factors (independent

Introduction
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a frequently disabling condition with an estimated
point prevalence of 4.4% (1). Recent genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have begun to
elucidate the genetic architecture of MDD (2; 3) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) derived from
the most recent study explain 1.5-3.2% of MDD risk in independent cohorts (4). As sole
predictors of MDD status, PRS have limited clinical utility and may not capture the larger
environmental contributions to risk.
Variation in DNA methylation (DNAm) in affected by both of genetic and environmental
factors, which act in combination to confer risk for diseases and complex traits (5), and has
recently been studied in relation to MDD. An epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) of
7,948 European individuals identified 3 CpG sites that were differentially methylated in
association with depressive symptoms (6). Annotation of these sites implicated genes involved in
axon guidance. A study of 150 MZ twins discordant for early-onset MDD identified 760
differentially methylated CpG sites which mapped to neuronal circuitry and plasticity genes (7).
These findings suggest that differences in DNAm may be relevant to the causes of MDD.
Many lifestyle factors associated with MDD are also robustly associated with DNAm.
Smoking (8), obesity (9; 10) and alcohol consumption (11) are each associated with differential
genome-wide DNAm. These DNAm signatures have been leveraged, using penalized regression
to identify a subset of informative CpG sites, to create DNAm risk scores (DNAm-RS) which
can predict the trait of interest in an independent cohort. McCartney and colleagues showed that
DNAm scores explained 61% of the variance in smoking status and 12.5% of the variance in
body mass index (BMI) and alcohol consumption. When modelled alongside PRS, DNAm scores
contribute additively to the variance explained for these traits (12). DNAm therefore acts as an

archive of exposure to several risk factors for poor mental health, but its value as a predictor of
MDD, however, remains unexplored.
The aim of this study was to use penalized regression to train a predictor of MDD based
on DNAm in the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS) cohort. A
training set of 1,223 MDD cases and 1,824 controls was used to create an MDD DNAm risk
score (DNAm-RS) in 1,970 independent individuals (363 prevalent and 190 incident cases; 1,417
controls). Using longitudinal clinical data, we also tested whether baseline DNAm-RS would
predict future MDD status at follow-up between 4-10 years later. Finally, to explore whether the
MDD DNAm-RS captures exposure to lifestyle factors associated with MDD, we tested the
association between MDD DNAm-RS and alcohol use, BMI, smoking status, and pack years, as
well as self-reported antidepressant use.

Methods
Study population: Generation Scotland - the Scottish Family Health Study (GS:SFHS)
Phenotypic information, DNAm data and genotypes were provided by GS:SFHS for the
current investigation. GS:SFHS is a family-based population cohort investigating the genetics of
health and disease in approximately 24,000 individuals across Scotland (13; 14). Baseline data
were collected between 2006 and 2011. The present study focuses on 5,017 individuals for
whom DNAm data from a blood draw at baseline contact, baseline phenotypic data, and
genotype data were available. Environmental data, such as lifestyle factors, were also measured
(BMI) or recorded (smoking status, alcohol consumption) on nearly all study participants.
Longitudinal phenotypic data is available for a subset of individuals who responded to a
recontact request. For these individuals we have information on MDD case-control status both at
baseline and follow-up, which occurred 4-10 years later (2015-2016). GS:SFHS received ethical
approval from NHS Tayside Research Ethics Committee (REC reference number 05/S1401/89)
and has Research Tissue Bank Status (reference: 15/ES/0040). W

Phenotypes
BMI was calculated using height (cm) and weight (kg) measured by clinical staff during
baseline recruitment. Alcohol intake was self-reported as part of a pre-clinical questionnaire.
Participants were asked whether they were ‘never’ ‘former’ or ‘current’ drinkers. Current
drinkers were asked: “During the past week, please record how many units of alcohol you have
had”. Smoking status was recorded by asking participants: “Have you ever smoked tobacco?”
Answers were recorded as: “Yes, currently smoke; Yes, but stopped within the past 12 months;
Yes, but stopped more than 12 months ago; No, never smoked”. For the current study, we

assigned smoking status as a binary variable, by converting all “Yes” answers to smoker (1), and
“No” to non-smoker (0). Using smoking behaviour data, pack years were calculated by
multiplying the number of cigarette packs (20 cigarettes/pack) smoked per day by the number of
years a person has smoked (16). Antidepressant use was self-reported by participants at the
baseline assessment and has been described in greater detail previously (17; Supplementary
Material).
Baseline MDD status was measured using the axis-I Structured Clinical Interview of the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, version IV (SCID) and was administered to participants who
answered “yes” to either of two screening questions (see supplemental methods). MDD status
was measured prospectively by remote paper questionnaire between 4 and 10 years after baseline
assessment (2015-2016) using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview - Short Form
(CIDI-SF) as described previously (15).
Control participants were defined as those individuals who answered “no” to the two
screening questions (see supplemental methods) and did not fulfill criteria for a diagnosis of
current or previous MDD following the SCID interview and CIDI-SF remote follow-up
assessment. Individuals fulfilling criteria for schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, or who selfreported these diagnoses, were also excluded from both case and control groups.

DNA methylation
9,873 individuals in GS:SFHS had genome-wide DNAm data profiled from blood
samples using the Illumina Human-MethylationEPIC BeadChip. The raw data were acquired,
preprocessed and quality checked in two different batches, hereafter named batch 1 (N = 5,190)
and batch 2 (N = 4,588).

In batch 1, ShinyMethyl (18) was used to exclude samples where predicted sex
mismatched recorded sex, as well as to plot the log median intensity of methylated and
unmethylated signals per array and inspect the output from the control probes; outlying samples
detected by visually inspection were excluded. WateRmelon (19) was then used to remove
probes in which > 1% of cytosine-guanine dinucleotide had a detection p-value > 0.05; probes
with a beadcount of < 3 in more than 5% samples; and probes in which > 5% of samples had a
detection p-value > 0.05 (12). Multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) plots were inspected to confirm
that there were no additional sample outliers. WateRmelon was then used to normalise the data,
data using the dasen method, and lumi (20) was used for conversion to M-values, which were
then pre-corrected for relatedness, estimated blood cell types, and processing batch using
DISSECT (21), for CpGs on autosomal chromosomes. The final dataset comprised corrected Mvalues at 841,753 loci measured for 5,087 individuals.
In batch 2, meffil (22) and ShinyMethyl (18) were used for quality control of the raw
data. Using meffil, samples were removed if: there was a mismatch between self-reported and
methylation-predicted sex; they had > 1% of CpG sites with a detection p-value > 0.05; they
showed evidence of dye bias; they were outliers for the bisulphite conversion control probes; and
had a median methylated signal intensity > 3 standard deviations lower than expected.
Afterwards, shinyMethyl was used to perform further quality control, as described above for
batch 1. Multi-dimensional scaling plots were inspected, and outliers were excluded. Meffil was
then used again to identify and exclude poor-performing probes, which were deemed as such if:
they had a beadcount of < 3 in > 5% samples and/or > 5% samples had a detection p-value >
0.05. The data were normalised using the dasen method in wateRmelon, and the beta2m function

in lumi (20) was used to generate M-values. The final dataset comprised M-values for 773,860
loci measured in 4,450 individuals.

Genotyping and PRS profiling
Individuals were genotyped using the Illumina OmniExpress BeadChip. The raw
genotype data underwent a series of quality control steps: individuals with a call rate < 98%,
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with a genotype rate < 98%, minor allele frequency <
1%, and

Hardy-Weinberg p-value < 10−6 were removed from the initial dataset and then

imputation was performed using the Sanger Imputation Service with the Haplotype Reference
Consortium panel v1.1 (23; 4).
Using the largest available depression GWAS (4), depression PRS were computed using
Plink v1.90b4 (24) using SNPs that met a significance level of p ≤ 0.05, in line with previous
studies which have shown that this threshold explains the most variance in MDD status (4).
GWAS summary statistics excluding GS:SFHS were obtained in order to create PRS in the
GS:SFHS sample. Clumping was applied using a linkage disequilibrium r2 < 0.1 and a 500-kb
window.

DNAm predictor – training and testing datasets
In order to obtain a training and testing dataset, individuals were separated based on the
two batches described above. Supplementary Figure 1 provides a flowchart summary of the
analysis process.

Training dataset

Batch 1 was used to train the DNAm predictor. The dataset consisted of controls who
were screened as unaffected (N = 1,824) at both baseline and follow-up (i.e. answered “no” to
screening questions at baseline and follow-up), or who screened positive but were subsequently
found not to fulfill diagnostic criteria for MDD using the SCID. MDD cases were those who
screened positive for depression by answering yes to one or more brief screening questions and
who subsequently fulfilled criteria for MDD at baseline SCID interview (N = 1,223). CpG sites
measured in these individuals were included as independent variables in a least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalised regression model described below.
Depression status was regressed on age, sex, and ten genetic principal components, and the
extracted residuals from this model were input as the dependent variable in the LASSO
regression model.
LASSO penalised regression models were run using the “glmnet” function in R in order
to train DNAm predictors. We applied tenfold cross-validation and the mixing parameter was set
to 1 for our LASSO penalty. 196 CpGs were included in the predictor that corresponded to the
minimum mean cross-validated error (see Supplementary Excel file 1 in supplementary materials
for a list of CpG sites and their regression weights).

Testing dataset
Batch 2 was used in order to create MDD DNAm-RS using the CpG sites identified in the
LASSO regression models. To create a single DNAm-RS, the CpG weights corresponding to the
196 CpG sites identified in the training sample were multiplied by the CpG values in the
independent sample. The DNAm-RS were tested for association with prevalent MDD cases
(depressed at baseline, N=363) and incident MDD cases (healthy at baseline but fulfilling criteria

for MDD at follow-up, N=190). The same 1,417 controls were used as the comparison group for
both sets of MDD cases and were unaffected at both baseline and follow-up. The incident MDD
cases were used to assess if the DNAm-RS could predict a future episode of MDD.

Statistical methods
Association of DNAm-RS with depression
In order to test whether DNAm-RS is associated with prevalent and incident MDD, MDD
status was regressed on and (1) DNAm-RS in the prevalent cases and controls (N = 1,780); and
(2) DNAm-RS in the incident cases and controls (N = 1,607) using logistic regression. We also
tested the association of DNAm-RS with prevalent (N = 1,250) and incident (N = 1,195) MDD
in a subset of individuals with no self-reported antidepressant use.
To determine how much phenotypic variance in MDD DNAm-RS explained compared to
a genetic PRS, we regressed MDD status on (1) PRS; (2) DNAm-RS; and (3) PRS and DNAmRS using logistic regression and calculated McFadden’s R2 for each variable. In addition, using
the “ROCR” R package, we plotted the predictive ability of DNAm-RS in both incident and
prevalent cases and controls using a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve,
representing the sensitivity and specificity of the score in relation to depression.

Association of DNAm-RS with lifestyle factors and antidepressant use
We tested whether lifestyle factors previously shown to be associated with both MDD
and DNAm (8; 9; 10; 11; 12) were also associated with the DNAm-RS. Using linear regression,
we tested whether DNAm-RS associated with BMI, pack years, and alcohol consumption.

Logistic regression models were used to test whether DNAm associated with self-reported
antidepressant use and smoking status.

Association of DNAm-RS with depression when adjusting for lifestyle factors
Finally, to estimate how much variance DNAm-RS explains in MDD status when
adjusting for lifestyle factors, MDD status was modelled as a dependent variable with alcohol
consumption, BMI, smoking and pack years fit as covariates. We also tested the effect of fitting
self-reported antidepressant use in our models to determine whether the DNAm-RS would still
significantly contribute to the risk for MDD. This was carried out for both incident and prevalent
cases.

Results
Association of DNAm-RS with depression
We found DNAm-RS was significantly associated with prevalent (Ntotal = 1,780; cases =

0.232, p = 0.011, R2 = 0.76%) MDD. The variance explained in the antidepressant-free subset
was slightly lower compared to the full prevalent case-control sample (antidepressant-free
sample: R2 = 1.66%; full sample: R2 = 1.75%); however, there was no evidence that the DNAmRS MDD association was significantly attenuated in the antidepressant free incident sub-sample.

Association of DNAm-RS with lifestyle factors and antidepressant use
DNAm-RS was found to be significantly associated with smoking status (β = 0.440, p =
< 2x10-16, R2 = 3.2%), pack years (β = 0.246, p = < 2x10-16, R2 = 6.5%), alcohol units (β = 0.092,
p = 9.85x10-5, R2 = 0.7%), and self-reported antidepressant use (β = 0.289, p = 0.002, R2 =
1.1%). BMI was not found to be significantly associated with DNAm-RS (β = 0.039, p = 0.099,
R2 = 0.097%) (Supplementary Table 2; Supplementary Figure 2).

Association of DNAm-RS with depression when adjusting for lifestyle factors
DNAm-RS was tested for its association with prevalent and incident depression while
adjusting for BMI, alcohol use, smoking status and pack years to determine if any independent
contribution remained from the DNAm-RS. Table 1 and Figure 3 detail the results. DNAm-RS
was still significantly associated with prevalent MDD status after adjusting for lifestyle factors (β
= 0.219, p = 0.001) but only explained 0.68% of the variance (independent R2 = 1.75%). For
incident depression cases, the DNAm-RS was no longer significantly associated with MDD
status after adjusting for lifestyle factors (variance explained decreased from 0.52% prior to
adjustment to 0.25% after adjustment).

Discussion
In the current study we demonstrate that a DNAm-RS explains 1.75% of the variance in
MDD status ascertained at the time of blood draw. The genetic PRS explained 2.40% of the
variance; additively, the PRS and DNAm-RS account for 3.99% of variance explained in total.
Given that MDD PRS scores have been trained on a sample of more than 800K individuals and
the DNAm-RS on only 3,047 individuals, the accuracy and clinical potential of DNAm risk
scores will likely increase as larger sample sizes with methylation data become available. DNAm
risk scores may yet provide clinically-valuable information about the risk of future MDD, albeit
that DNAm scores were more weakly associated with future MDD in individuals who were
unaffected at baseline, than with case-control status ascertained at the same time as DNA was
collected.
In the current study, the MDD DNAm predictor was significantly associated with
smoking status and alcohol consumption, but not with BMI (smoking status: R2 = 3.2%; alcohol

consumption: R2 = 0.7%). After adjustment for BMI or smoking status, the DNAm-RS
association with MDD was substantially attenuated. These lifestyle factors have previously been
associated with MDD (25; 26; 27; 28; 29) and are known to robustly associate with patterns of
DNAm (12). The attenuation of the association between DNAm-RS and MDD likely reveals that
the DNAm based predictor of MDD may be acting as an archive of the effects of these, and
other, lifestyle variables. DNAm-RS was also significantly associated with MDD in a subset of
individuals with no self-reported antidepressant use. In addition, the DNAm-RS was also
significantly associated with self-reported antidepressant use, although this association does not
account for the DNAm-RS MDD associations reported. This finding suggests that DNAm-RS
may also be sensitive to the effects of antidepressant use and that future studies should examine
whether DNAm-RS trained on antidepressant use may be valuable as a measure of
antidepressant absorption or pharmacological action.
The current study, to our knowledge, is the first to investigate a DNAm risk score for
MDD in one of the largest samples of DNAm data to date. Using penalised regression models to
train our DNAm predictor poses several advantages over other approaches, such as modelling all
CpG sites simultaneously or allowing for a non-arbitrary selection of CpG sites, and provided a
set of discriminating CpG sites for use in downstream analyses. Moreover, the use of a single
score instead of thousands of independent loci allows for a more comprehensive analysis
investigating the additive effect of a large number of variants and permits the use of smaller
sample sizes. Finally, we were able to gain insight into a novel association between a DNAm-RS
and depression, over and above genetic and environmental risk arising from lifestyle factors.
In conclusion, our results show that a DNAm risk score is significantly associated with
current and future MDD status, enhancing prediction from polygenic risk scores and

samples, these findings may have future clinical applications for MDD risk stratification and
justify further efforts to collect DNAm in larger samples.

Supplementary materials
Baseline MDD in GS:SFHS
SCID was administered to participants who answered “yes” to either of the following
screening questions: “Have you ever seen anybody for emotional or psychiatric problems?” and
“Was there ever a time when you, or someone else, thought you should see someone because of
the way you were feeling or acting?” Answers from the SCID were used to ascertain MDD case
status.
Antidepressant use measurement in GS:SFHS
A self-report measure of antidepressant use was recorded by participants in two different
ways: within the first phase of the study, a text-based questionnaire was used to record type of
antidepressant taken; participants recruited between June 2009 and March 2011 completed a
questionnaire recording medication use through a “yes/no” checkbox, with an accompanying
question: “Are you regularly taking any of the following medications?”, of which one of the
answers was “Antidepressants” .

In the prevalent cases and controls, 108 affected individuals reported they take an
antidepressant, whereas 198 reported no antidepressant use; in the incident cases and controls, 20
individuals reported taking an antidepressant, and 143 reported no antidepressant use; 1,052
healthy individuals reported not taking an antidepressant, and 27 report antidepressant use.
