Background: Dyspareunia is a classic symptom of endometriosis but is neglected in research
and clinical contexts. This study explored the experience of this endometriosis-associated sexual
pain.
Methods: This was a qualitative descriptive study that included people who had experienced
endometriosis-associated dyspareunia alone or with a partner. Data collection involved semistructured interviews with a female researcher that began with an open-ended question about
dyspareunia and included interview prompts related to the nature of sexual pain. Interviews were
recorded, transcribed verbatim, and analysed for themes.
Results: 17 participants completed interviews. The mean participant age was 33.3 (SD=7.2) and
most participants identified as white (82%), were college-educated (71%), identified as
heterosexual (65%), and were partnered (59%). Location, onset, and character emerged as
important, interrelated features of endometriosis-associated dyspareunia, as did severity and
impact. Dyspareunia occurred at the vaginal opening (n=7) and in the abdomen/pelvis (n=13).
Pain at the vaginal opening began with initial penetration and had pulling, burning and stinging
qualities. Pain in the pelvis was typically experienced with deep penetration or in certain position
and was described as sharp, stabbing and/or cramping. Dyspareunia ranged from mild to severe,
and for some participants had a marked psychosocial impact.
Conclusions: Dyspareunia is a heterogeneous symptom of endometriosis that ranges in severity
and impact. Disaggregating dyspareunia into superficial and deep types may better reflect the
etiologies of this pain, thereby improving outcome measurement in intervention studies and
clinical care.

INTRODUCTION
Endometriosis is a gynecological condition that affects 10 percent of females and is
characterized by the growth of ectopic endometrial-type tissue. [1] More than half of people with
endometriosis experience pain during sexual intercourse.[2,3] This pain, called dyspareunia, is
associated with psychosocial sequalae including poor quality of life,[3,4] low self-esteem,[5–7]
and relationship difficulties.[5,7,8]
Despite its prevalence and impact, dyspareunia is considered a ‘neglected symptom’ of
endometriosis.[9] Clinically, its neglect has been attributed to embarrassment and normalization
by clinicians and patients as well as a dearth of evidenced-based treatment options.[8,9]
Dyspareunia has also been neglected in the research context, where it is not validly
operationalized and studies are underpowered to detect relevant outcomes.[10]
Several qualitative studies have highlighted the impact of dyspareunia on the lives of people with
endometriosis.[5–8,11,12] Qualitative data about dyspareunia have also been collected for the
development of patient-reported outcome measures of endometriosis pain.[13–18] However,
reporting of the results has not focused on sexual pain and demographic characterization of
participants is often limited.
Largely absent from the literature is a complete description of what endometriosis-associated
sexual pain feels like or where and when it happens. The aim of this study was therefore to
provide a comprehensive account of dyspareunia in the everyday terms people with
endometriosis use to describe the pain. Such data are required to support more accurate
phenotyping of this symptom in clinical and research contexts.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Design
This was a qualitative descriptive study. Compared to other approaches, qualitative description
requires less interpretation and instead focuses on identifying and reporting the fundamental
elements of an experience in the words of participants.[19]

Patient and Public Involvement
The research conducted by our team is guided by a Patient Research Advisory Board. The Board
approved the study design and was not involved with recruitment. Participants will receive the
peer-reviewed article with a plain language summary of the results.
Participants and Recruitment
Participants were recruited from the Endometriosis Pelvic Pain Interdisciplinary Cohort data
registry (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02911090). The data registry is open to patients
attending a tertiary centre for endometriosis and captures longitudinal demographic and clinical
data. Potential participants were enrolled in the data registry and consented to be contacted for
research. Inclusion criteria were age of 18 years or older, clinically suspected or diagnosed
endometriosis, and current or previous dyspareunia alone or with a partner. Exclusion criteria
were never sexually active alone or with a partner, no history of dyspareunia alone or with a
partner, and inability to communicate in English. Recruitment continued until saturation, the
point when additional interviews did not reveal new insights about the experience of sexual pain.
To reflect the demographic characteristics of patients seen at the tertiary centre, potential
participants were randomly selected from within overlapping education, sexual orientation, and
ethnicity groups. KW contacted selected participants by phone to present the study, introduce
herself and her program of research, and screen for eligibility. Interested participants received
and returned consent forms by e-mail. To reduce bias, each selected participant was called a
minimum of five times and at different times of day before a subsequent participant was selected.
Data Collection and Analysis
The interview guide was developed by KW, a graduate student with theoretical and applied
training in qualitative methodologies, SC a qualitative health researcher focused on illness
experiences throughout the life course, PY a clinician-scientist with expertise in endometriosis,
and members of the Patient Research Advisory Board for the Centre for Pelvic Pain and
Endometriosis. KW pilot tested the interview guide and conducted a single one-on-one semistructured telephone interview with each participant. Each interview began with the question
“Tell me about the pain you experience with sex”; initial prompts related to a priori themes of

pain site, onset, character, radiation, associations, time course, and exacerbating/relieving
factors. Contemporaneous field notes permitted the identification of emergent themes and
assessment of saturation. Demographic and clinical data were drawn from the data registry.
The interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim by KW, SI, and a research
assistant. Using Nvivo 12 Pro,[20] KW conducted a qualitative content analysis of the
transcripts.[21] The analysis involved reading the set of transcripts to get a global sense of the
data; reading transcripts individually and highlighting words that captured key concepts as codes;
sorting the codes into categories based on relatedness; and organizing the categories into
meaningful clusters.
To ensure reliability of the analysis, SI coded two randomly selected transcripts and crosschecked her findings with those of KW. Transcript and analysis checking with the participants
was not completed given the low-inference approach to analysis.
RESULTS
Participants
Of 50 potential participants we attempted to contact about the study, 17 completed an interview,
11 could not be reached, 10 were ineligible, 4 declined to participate, and 8 were lost to follow
up. The average age of the participants was 33.3 years (SD=7.2, range 23-50). Race, gender
identity, sexual orientation, educational attainment, marital status, parity, and endometriosis
status are described in Table 1. Mean dyspareunia scores for initial penetration and deep
penetration on an 11-point numeric rating scale (0=no pain, 10=worst pain imaginable) were 3.3
(SD=3.4, range 0-8) and 6.6 (SD=2.8, range 0-10) respectively. The average interview length
was 28 minutes (SD=13, range 14-72).

Pain Fundamentals
Table 2 shows that across participants, pain began at different points in the sexual encounter. The
table also shows that participants used a range of terms to describe the character and anatomic
location of their endometriosis-associated sexual pain.

I feel it right in my stomach [51]
I’m having such sharp pain [035]
It felt like an ache, that’s what it sort felt like, like a real ache
[015]
A really, really bad cramp [089]
A stabbing pain, I guess you could call it [045]
I almost feel like, it’s like a spasm that happens [051]
It feels almost like a bone bruise [109]
It felt like it was burning [031]
Everything is inflamed [051]
It feels like my whole insides are being pulled around [038]
It's kind of like pulsing [033]
It’s like something is punching you [130]
It's kind of like a stinging feeling [033]
That part of me is still very tense and tight [068]
It’s an uncomfortable feeling [087]

Some participants had difficulty naming the site of their pain and occasionally explained its
location in terms of other painful experiences.
I’m not really not familiar with my biology, the reproductive parts. But the inside. So is it
the cervix? Or the uterus? [130]
That’s really hard to explain, because I can’t really pinpoint where it is. It’s not on the
outside, it’s the inside where, if I was pointing at my pelvis, like a couple inches in. [089]
The same place I would experience period cramps. [051]
All participants experienced pain in the pelvis or pelvic organs and seven participants also
experienced pain at the vaginal introitus. For example, participant 020 said,
I have a few different things with pain with penetration.
This participant went on to clarify,
So I experience the three types of penetrative pain so like the penetrative pain in my
vagina, and then deep vaginal pain, and I also experience uterine pain with arousal and
orgasm.
Except for two participants who reported pelvic pain at orgasm and two who reported pelvic pain
after intercourse, pain in this area began with deep penetration or certain sexual positions and
was associated with sharp, aching, cramping or stabbing feelings. In contrast, pain at the vaginal
opening always began with initial penetration and was associated with pulling, stinging, or
burning.
Pain Severity
When asked about the severity of their pain, 14 participants spontaneously rated their pain as a
score out of 10. Participants also described the severity of their pain.
It’s not so bad where you’re like heeled over, like when you have your period with endo,
where you can’t move or anything like that, it’s not even close to that, it’s just, it’s more
uncomfortable I’d say. [030]

I could keep going if I mentally prepared myself but there is also like a side to me that
would just want to stop. [033]
So, it wasn’t the worst pain I’d experienced but it was uncomfortable enough that I would
have to stop doing that activity. [043]
It wasn’t quite at a level I would pass out from the pain, but I would definitely cry quite a
bit. [031]
The worst pain I’ve ever felt. Nothing could be done, I can’t have people around me, I
don’t like noises, I just want everyone to just leave me alone. There’s nothing that can be
done for it to really go away you know, until it goes away. I don’t know, it’s scary. [051]
Pain Impact
Fifteen participants reported having interrupted sex because of pain and ten had avoided sexual
experiences.
The experience of sexual pain affected the emotional and psychological well-being of some
participants.
It’s hard for me to just deny all the time because I start to feel bad. [033]
It would make me feel sort of you know, emotionally kind of discouraged. [043]
I feel insignificant, you almost feel broken or something. [051]
You feel guilty for having to stop. [089]
Many participants also reported that the experience of sexual pain impacted their intimate
relationships.
I think my husband was reluctant to approach me for sex because he knew I was feeling ill.
You know, you don’t want to ask somebody who’s feeling ill to “Hey let’s go!” I’m glad
we’ve got a solid marriage and we’ve weathered the storms and we’re ok now. But it was a
really tough time. [043]

I don’t ever want to have sex, I would be happy to not do it at all, but I have to get myself
in the mood. I try once a month to have, you know, that closeness with him even though for
me its not pleasurable at all […]. It has kept me keeping some secrets from my lover, which
is not how our relationship normally is. [038]
Lately, we just have sex is because we want to conceive, or try to conceive [...] we don’t
really have sex just because we wanted to. [130]
It got to the point where I was in pain so often from intercourse, that my partner and I
basically decided that we just weren’t going to anymore, that it just wasn’t worth me going
through the pain […] It contributed to the end of that relationship. [031]
For one participant who was single, sexual pain affected her willingness to seek out physical
intimacy.
I don’t want to watch the horrified faces as I’m suddenly leaping out of bed because I’m in
so much pain. [035]
Some participants had sexual intercourse infrequently or not at all. Four participants reported that
hormonal treatment relieved their pain, but in one instance the treatment also negatively affected
sexual desire. Other participants found ways of managing and coping with their pain.
I typically have to take anti-inflammatories for the pain and just managing it, or a hot
water bottle, a hot shower, that sort of thing. [109]
We went out and bought that masturbation sleeve and we kind of control the depth just to
kind of prevent [the pain] from happening. [051]
I just think about noises or him speaking to me and I really just focus on that. I take my
mind away from what’s actually happening. [033]
I have pain with penetration almost all the time, but I am able to accommodate it in a way
so it’s not severe enough that it stops the experience and like I can change a position or
stop having penetration and it’s fine and I can continue with my sexual experience. [020]

I’ve gone to therapy to try to stop myself from feeling guilty right away and just be okay
with the fact that like, we might have to change things up and that’s okay. [089]
DISCUSSION
This study set out to identify the fundamental features of endometriosis-associated dyspareunia.
Participants reported pain in the pelvis or pelvic organs, which generally began with deep
penetration or certain positions and had a sharp, aching, cramping, or stabbing quality. Almost
half of participants also experienced pain at the vaginal opening that began with initial
penetration and had a pulling, burning, or stinging nature. This pain ranged in severity and in
some cases had a significant, negative impact.
Although participants sometimes struggled to describe the location of their sexual pain, our study
showed that dyspareunia typically occurred in the pelvis and at the vaginal opening. These
results aligned with research by Fauconnier et al. that identified five themes associated with
sexual pain: strong and sharp pain, deep internal pain, pain in certain positions, distracting pain
that prevents or disrupts intercourse, and a burning feeling during or after intercourse.[22]
Clinically, the finding of pelvic pain with deep penetration corresponds with the understanding
of endometriosis-associated dyspareunia whereas the description of pain at the vaginal opening
that begins with initial penetration mirrors the presentation of other gynecological conditions like
provoked vestibulodynia.[23]
Important secondary findings of this study related to the impact and management of
endometriosis-associated sexual pain. Dyspareunia had a variety physical, emotional, mental,
and interpersonal effects that participants managed with medical, physical, and cognitive
interventions. These results aligned with previous work recommending a biopsychosocial model
and interdisciplinary treatment approach for endometriosis-associated sexual pain.[24,25]
The defining strength of the study was its exclusive and in-depth approach to characterizing
endometriosis-associated sexual pain. The findings confirmed and extended those of Fauconnier
et al., who described dyspareunia using data from 10-minute French-language interviews about
painful symptoms of endometriosis.[22] Additional strengths were that the study sample was

selected to reflect the demographic characteristics of the clinical population and that participants
ranged in severity of their self-reported sexual pain.
An obvious limitation of the study was that participants were not selected based on gold-standard
surgical diagnosis (Table 2). However, this reflects a shift towards clinical diagnosis in
practice.[26] A second limitation was that all participants had previously attended a tertiary
centre where they completed dyspareunia measures and discussed the sexual pain with a care
provider. Together with high levels of education in the study sample, earlier clinical interactions
may have affected how participants described their pain.
Our findings have implications for endometriosis-associated dyspareunia in clinical research.
First, measuring sexual pain without distinguishing between pelvic pain and pain at the vaginal
opening may capture dyspareunia that arises from other conditions,[27] thereby leading to
misclassification and potentially biasing the effect of interventions toward the null. Second,
reliance on onset- or location-based vocabulary in patient-reported measures might limit
response accuracy; diagrams that highlight the relevant anatomic sites could facilitate true
responses. Third, although recent clinical trials have used ordinal response options (i.e., none,
mild, moderate, severe),[28] reporting dyspareunia on a scale of 10 is intuitive for respondents
and aligns with recommendations for the measurement of patient-important endometriosis pain
symptoms.[29] Finally, research focused on sexual pain should seek to account for the physical
and emotional impact of this symptom.
Clinically, our findings suggested that people who experience endometriosis-associated
dyspareunia have unmet treatment needs. Asking whether a patient has any concerns regarding
pain with sexual activity that they would like to discuss can avoid neglect of this symptom due to
taboos or normalization.[5,6] For patients who consider their sexual pain a priority, determining
whether the pain occurs in the pelvis or at the vaginal opening will help guide additional
investigations and treatments. Involving intimate partners in counselling about dyspareunia with
the consent of both parties can also improve the patient-centeredness of care.[30]
Dyspareunia is a primary symptom of endometriosis, yet has been relegated to a secondary or
tertiary outcome in clinical trials research.[28,29] Other studies have established that
endometriosis-associated sexual pain negatively affects physical and psychosocial well-being, a

finding that the present work reinforced. This study also provided a comprehensive insight into
the experience of dyspareunia in endometriosis, yielding methodological considerations for how
this symptom should be measured as well as clinical implications. We hope that by providing a
rich description of endometriosis-associated sexual pain, this work will be hypothesis-generating
and will contribute to rigorous investigation of dyspareunia in endometriosis.
