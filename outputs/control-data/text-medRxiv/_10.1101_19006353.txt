ABSTRACT

A ban on smoking in cars with children was implemented in April 2015 in England and December
2016 in Scotland. With survey data from both countries (NEngland=3,483-6,920 and NScotland=232-319),
we used this natural experiment to assess the impact of the ban using a difference-in-differences
approach. We conducted logistic regression analyses within a Difference-in-Difference framework
and adjusted for age, sex, a marker of deprivation and survey weighting for non-response. Among
children aged 13-15 years, self-reported levels of regular exposure to smoke in cars were 3.4% in
2012, 2.2% in 2014 and 1.3% in 2016 for Scotland and 6.3%, 5.9% and 1.6% in England. The ban was
associated with a 73% reduction (95%CI -59%, -81%) in self-reported exposure to tobacco smoke
among children.
INTRODUCTION

Exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke is a significant cause of illness in children and particularly
affects more disadvantaged groups [1]. Exposure of children to smoking inside cars is especially
concerning due to the very high concentrations that accumulate in these enclosed spaces and its
association with a greater risk of child smoking uptake [2][3]. Both smoking uptake and levels of
child exposure to smoke in cars are socially patterned, and as such serve as mechanisms which
sustain health inequality [4][5][6].
One policy response has been to ban smoking in private vehicles with children present. Evaluations
of the impact of banning smoking in cars with children are scarce and present a mixed picture [7][8].
A ban on smoking in private vehicles with anyone ≤18 years present came into effect on 1st October
2015 in England, and on 5th December 2016 in Scotland. This difference in timing provides a natural
experiment to evaluate the impact of the policy.

Data for England came from the Smoking, Drinking and Drug Use surveys and for Scotland from the
Scottish Health Surveys in 2012, 2014 and 2016 (further details in Online Supplementary Material).
We restricted the sample to children aged 13-15, as children aged 11 and 12 years old had exposure
reported by caregivers in Scotland, which is likely to lead to under-recording.

Our primary exposure was child-reported regular exposure to smoking inside cars (Table 1). For
England, we categorised responses of

every day or most days

or

once or twice a week

as "regular

exposure." In Scotland children were asked “Are you regularly exposed to other people’s tobacco
smoke in any of these places?” (Responses: yes/no for a range of locations including “cars/vehicles”).
We also included data on age, sex and a marker of deprivation, harmonised between years and
countries as set out in Table 1.

We used survey-weighted logistic regression to assess changes in exposure over time using
differences-in-differences analysis which is commonly used for policy evaluation since it controls for
all time-invariant differences between the intervention and comparison populations [9]. We
modelled a linear trend for time individually for both Scotland and England individually and a binary
variable for 2016 in England as the one post-intervention data point, interacted with time.
We conducted using data from England only (ages 11-15) which make use of more granular exposure
data to conduct analyses of ever, monthly, and regular exposure.

RESULTS

There were 15,318 responses in England and 822 in Scotland (Appendix

Table 1)

. Self-reported

regular exposure to smoke in cars were 3.4% in 2012, 2.2% in 2014 and 1.3% in 2016 for Scotland
and 6.3%, 5.9%, and 1.6% in England (Figure 1).

Implementation of the smoke-free policy in England was associated with a 73% reduction in the
percentage of children self-reporting exposure to smoke in cars compared to trends in Scotland
(AOR=0.27, 95%CI 0.19-0.41) (Table

2).

Children in England were more likely to report exposure

than those in Scotland (AOR=2.35, 95%CI 1.28-4.30). Girls were more likely to report exposure than
boys (AOR=1.61, 95%CI 1.34-1.93), as were those in the deprived group compared with the rest of
the sample (AOR=1.98, 95%CI 1.61-2.43).
Analyses within England only, using the wider age range of 11 to 15 years, identified lower levels of
reported exposure after policy implementation than predicted by preceding trends, ranging from
AOR 0.75 (95%CI 0.62-0.90 for ever exposure to AOR 0.26 (95%CI 0.18-0.36)) for regular exposure
(Appendix Table 2).

DISCUSSION

The main outcome of the study is that child-reported exposure to tobacco smoke in cars fell
following the 2015 introduction of the ban in England, a finding made more robust by the
comparison with Scotland where the policy was introduced the following year. We also show that
this exposure remains more common in children from more deprived groups, which serves as a
reminder of the socially patterned risks of smoking. Our findings provide support for introducing this
policy in other jurisdictions as part of comprehensive tobacco control strategies. Previous research
using data from Canadian provinces enacting such bans found more marked impacts on exposure in
provinces with comprehensive strategies including discouraging smoking uptake and encouraging
smoking cessation [8]. Recent evidence has also pointed to a role in exposure to smoking in cars in
the incidence of asthma, which widens the potential health benefits of such legislation [10].

The ban is an example of the “Protect” element of the MPOWER policy approach to delivering the
WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control programme to reduce the harms caused by
smoking. Importantly, the purpose of the ban is to reduce child exposure to tobacco smoke, for
which this study provides evidence, not to drive prosecutions (see, for example, coverage presenting
the legislation as a failure due to the low number of arrests https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uknews/car-smoking-ban-massive-flop-10858407 (last visited 21st August 2019)).
Strengths and limitations

The strength of this natural experiment using high-quality data from Scotland and England is that
because of its design the observed change can plausibly be ascribed to the policy intervention. A
limitation is that there were only three data points for each country. Although survey data were not
collected in precisely the same way between countries and years the approach we employed to
harmonise measures was robust and any differences should not have affected changes over time.
Exposure was based on self-report only, and reporting bias may have changed over time, although
this would likely have been similar in both countries and so not significantly bias our findings.
Interview dates were not available for the Scottish data and sampling in 2016 included almost two
months after the introduction of their ban, resulting in some potential misclassification.
Conclusions

Our results suggest that banning smoking in private vehicles carrying children has been successful in
its main aim of reducing their exposure to tobacco smoke. Given children’s known vulnerability to
second-hand smoke exposure, the observed reduction is likely to have resulted in improved health.

Further information on data sources

SDDU is a survey of children in school years 7 – 11 (aged 11-15 years) and is used to monitor the
performance of the Government tobacco strategy [11][12][13][14][15].Data came from
questionnaires administered to children at school in exam conditions and is designed to be
representative of the gender, age, region and type of school in England. Data for Scotland come
from the years 2012, 2014 and 2016, where children aged 13 years and older were asked to report
their exposure to smoking in cars [16][17][18]. For children below this age, caregivers were asked to
report exposure, but we have excluded this data due to concerns over the accuracy of caregiver
reporting of exposure.

There were differences in the collection of data on markers of deprivation over time in England. In
2012 and 2014 children were asked if they received Free School Meals (FSM), but this measure was
not used in 2016. The 2016 data used the Family Affluence Scale which asks children how many
computers, vehicles and bathrooms their family has and assigned them a band from low to high [19].
We have harmonised these two measures by considered those receiving FSM or in the low FAS band
as deprived. Scottish data used the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation as a marker of deprivation,
and we harmonised the data by using the most deprived group as equivalent to receiving FSM or
being in the lowest FAS band.
