Abstract:

39

Background: Studies in male firefighters have demonstrated increased exposures to

40

carcinogenic compounds and increased rates of certain cancers compared to the general

41

population. Many chemicals related to these occupational exposures have been

42

associated with breast tumor development in animal and human studies, yet, there have

43

been no studies on women firefighters due to their low numbers in most fire departments.

44

To address this data gap, the Women Firefighters Biomonitoring Collaborative (WFBC)

45

created a biological sample archive and analyzed levels of perfluoroalkyl substances

46

(PFAS) among women firefighters and office workers in San Francisco.

47

Methods: Active duty women firefighters (n=86) and office workers (n=84) were recruited

48

from the San Francisco Fire Department and the City and County of San Francisco,

49

respectively. Serum samples were collected and analyzed using liquid chromatography

50

tandem mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS) to measure and compare PFAS levels between

51

firefighters and office workers. For PFAS congeners detected in at least 70% of our study

52

population, we examined differences in serum PFAS levels controlling for dietary,

53

demographic and other confounders. Among firefighters, we assessed associations

54

between occupational activities and PFAS levels.

55

Results: Eight of 12 PFAS congeners were detected at levels above the limit of detection

56

and seven were detected in at least 70% of the study population. Four PFAS were

57

detected in all study participants (PFNA, PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS). In regression models

58

comparing PFAS levels by occupation and adjusting for potential confounders, firefighters

59

had higher geometric mean (GM) concentrations of PFAS compared to office workers:

60

2.39 (95%CI = 1.64,3.48), 2.32 (95% CI = 1.17,4.62) and 1.26 (95% CI = 0.99, 1.59) times

61

higher for PFHxS, PFUnDA and PFNA, respectively. In analyses limited to firefighters,

62

PFAS levels varied by assigned position in the fire department—firefighters and officers

63

had higher PFNA, PFOA, PFDA, and PFUnDA compared to drivers. Additionally,

64

firefighters who reported having used firefighting foam had higher concentrations of PFOA

65

compared firefighters who reported never having used foam.

66

Conclusion: Our study found ubiquitous exposures to PFAS among WFBC participants,

67

with women firefighters exposed to higher levels of some PFAS compared to office

68

workers, suggesting that some of these exposures may be occupationally related.

Introduction:

70

Firefighters have higher rates of some cancers compared to the general population. A

71

meta-analysis of 32 studies found elevated rates of lymphoma, testicular, and prostate

72

cancer among male firefighters.1 Additionally, a review by the International Agency for

73

Research on Cancer (IARC) found increased cancer rates among firefighters, and

74

designated the occupation of firefighting as “possibly carcinogenic” or “class 2b”.2 More

75

recently, a study of over 19,000 United States firefighters conducted by the National

76

Institute for Occupational Health and Safety (NIOSH) found that total time spent at fires

77

was associated with increased lung cancer incidence and mortality, and total number of

78

fire responses was associated with leukemia mortality.3 Furthermore, studies in other

79

countries have found increased rates of several cancers among male firefighters and

80

other first responders including brain, thyroid, bladder, kidney, prostate, testicular,

81

breast, digestive cancers, multiple myeloma, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.4–10 Despite

82

mounting concern about cancer among male firefighters, few studies have assessed

83

chemical exposures or cancer risk among women firefighters, many of whom are

84

concerned about the potential increased risk of breast cancer and other reproductive

85

cancers. Only two studies have examined the incidence of cancer among women

86

firefighters. Daniels et al. found that women firefighters had higher incidence and

87

mortality rates of breast cancer compared to the general US population, though neither

88

effect estimate was statistically significant.3 A study of Florida firefighters found that

89

women firefighters had an increase in overall cancer risk and, in particular, an increased

90

incidence of Hodgkin’s disease and cervical and thyroid cancers compared to the

91

general Florida population.9

92
93

Occupational exposures may be an important contributor to the increased risk of cancer

94

among firefighters. Firefighters’ exposure to environmental chemicals may arise from

95

fire suppression activities and during the salvage and overhaul phase of a fire event.11–

aromatic hydrocarbons,13,21–24 formaldehyde, dioxins, polybrominated diphenyl eithers

Additionally, hazardous chemicals have been identified in fire station dust, firefighting

Previous studies have shown that firefighters are occupationally exposed to polycyclic

100

(PBDEs), organophosphate flame retardants,25,26 and perfluoroalkyl substances

101

(PFAS),19,25,27,28 among others.25,29,30 Many of these chemicals have been associated

102

with adverse health outcomes including breast cancer and breast tumor development in

103

both animal and human studies.31,32

104
105

PFAS may be of particular relevance to firefighting because these compounds are used

106

in turnout gear and are a major ingredient of some firefighting foams, such as aqueous

107

film-forming foams (AFFF).19,28,33 More generally, PFAS chemicals are frequently

108

applied to food contact paper, fabrics and furniture to make them stain, water and

109

grease resistant.34 PFAS have long half-lives and bioaccumulate in the environment and

110

human body.35 Because of their widespread use and persistence, they have been

111

detected in nearly everyone tested in large biomonitoring studies.36,37 Biomonitoring

112

studies within the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a

113

nationally representative sample of the U.S. population, have found that more than 98%

114

of people tested had multiple congeners of PFAS detected in their bodies.36

115
116

PFAS exposure has been linked to multiple adverse health outcomes including cancer,

117

immune suppression, thyroid and sex hormone disruption, and decreased semen

118

quality.38–41 Studies also indicate that exposure is associated with metabolic effects,

119

ulcerative colitis and adverse effects on liver and kidney function.42–45

120
121

Several firefighter biomonitoring studies measured PFAS levels and found higher levels

122

among firefighters compared to the general population.25,27,28 These studies, however,

123

included few or no women. Overall, women remain underrepresented in studies of

124

firefighters, and very little is known about the extent of their chemical exposures or

125

occupational health risks for diseases such breast cancer.

126
127

Although women make up 5.1% of firefighters across the United States,46 their numbers

128

can be higher in urban jurisdictions, including in San Francisco, which has one of the

129

highest proportions of women firefighters (15%) in any large urban fire department in

130

the U.S.47 As fire departments and other first responder professions diversify and recruit

131

more women to their ranks, it is important to characterize chemical exposures and

132

implications for health outcomes of particular relevance to women, such as breast

133

cancer. To address this data gap, a partnership of firefighters, environmental health

134

scientists, and environmental health advocates created the Women Firefighters

135

Biomonitoring Collaborative (WFBC). The WFBC is a community-based, participatory

136

biomonitoring project that aims to better understand how women firefighters are

137

exposed to potential breast carcinogens, while also developing a biospecimen archive

138

of women firefighters and office workers in San Francisco. As part of the WFBC, we

139

conducted a cross-sectional chemical biomonitoring study to compare levels of PFAS in

140

human serum collected from women firefighters from the San Francisco Fire

141

Department (SFFD) and non-firefighter women who are office workers for the City and

142

County of San Francisco. To our knowledge, this is the first biomonitoring study to

143

measure environmental chemical exposures in an exclusively female cohort of

144

firefighters and office workers.

145
146

Methods:

147

Recruitment:

148

Participant recruitment and sample collection took place between June 2014 and March

149

2015. Firefighter participants were recruited from the SFFD, via word-of-mouth, emails

150

through the Department listserv and an article about the study in the “The Mainline,” a

151

Department newsletter written and edited by both active and retired firefighters.

152

Similarly, office workers, who were non-first responder employees of the City and

153

County of San Francisco, were recruited via word-of-mouth, public meetings, health

154

fairs, and listserv emails targeting employees of the City and County of San Francisco.

155
156

Study inclusion criteria for both firefighters and office workers included being female,

157

over 18 years old, a full-time employee, and a non-smoker. In addition, firefighters

158

needed to have at least five years of service with the SFFD and currently be on “active

159

duty” (i.e. assigned to a fire station) at the time of recruitment. All participants were

160

consented into the study following protocols approved by the Institutional Review Board

161

of the University of California, Berkeley (# 2013-07-5512).

162
163

Exposure assessment interview:

164

After consent and enrollment into the WFBC study, we conducted an hour-long in-

165

person exposure assessment interview with each participant. The interview captured

166

demographic information, basic health information, and possible sources of PFAS

167

exposure from occupational activities, consumer product use, and dietary factors that

168

prior literature indicates are potential sources of PFAS exposure.27,48,49 Food frequency

169

responses were converted to times per week and categorized into quartiles, tertiles, or

170

ever/never.

171
172

Sample collection and processing

173

Blood samples were collected by a certified phlebotomist in 40 mL additive-free glass

174

tubes and transported in a cooler with ice for processing within 3 hours of collection.

175

Serum was separated by allowing clotting at room temperature, then centrifuging at

176

3000 rpm for 10 minutes. Serum was aliquoted into 1.2 mL cryo-vial tubes and stored at

177

-80 oC until analysis per standard protocols.50 All samples were processed and

178

analyzed at the University of California, San Francisco.

179
180

Laboratory analysis:

181

Twelve PFAS (perfluorobutanoic acid, PFBA; perfluorobutane sulfonic acid, PFBuS;

182

perfluorohexanoic acid, PFHxA; perfluorohexane sulfonic acid, PFHxS;

183

perfluoroheptanoic acid, PFHpA; perfluorooctanoic acid, PFOA; perfluorooctane

184

sulfonic acid, PFOS; perfluorooctane sulfonamide, PFOSA; perfluorononanoic acid,

185

PFNA; perfluorodecanoic acid, PFDA; perfluoroundecanoic acid, PFUnDA;

186

perfluorododecanoic acid, PFDoA) were analyzed in each serum sample (0.5 mL) using

187

liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). An Agilent LC1260

188

(Sta. Clara, CA)- AB Sciex API 5500 (Foster City, CA) platform was used in the

189

analysis. Prior to injection into the LC-MS/MS, each sample was prepared for analysis

190

by solid phase extraction using a Waters Oasis HLB cartridge (10 mg, 1cc). Extracted

191

aliquots of each sample (25uL) were run in duplicates. The twelve analytes were

192

separated by elution gradient chromatography using Phenomenex Kinetex C18 column

193

(100 x 4.6 mm, 2.6µ) at 40ºC. An electrospray ionization source operated in the

194

negative mode was used to ionize each analyte in the mass spectrometer.

195
196

Analytes were detected in each sample by multiple reaction monitoring using two

197

transitions per analyte. To determine the presence of each analyte retention matching

198

(within 0.15 min) along with the peak area ratio between its qualifier and quantifier ions

199

(within 20%) were used. Quantification of each detected analyte was done by isotope

200

dilution method using a 10-point calibration curve (0.02-50 ng/mL) and employing two

201

C13-labelled PFAS isotopologues. The limits of quantification for the twelve analytes

202

range from 0.05 to 0.1 ng/mL. Analyte identification from total ion chromatograms was

203

evaluated using AB Sciex Analyst v2.1 software while quantification of each analyte was

204

processed using AB Sciex MultiQuant v2.02 software. Analysts were blinded to

205

firefighter and office worker status of the serum samples during the analysis. Results

206

were reported in ng/mL for all 170 study participants.

207
208

Statistical analysis:

209

We examined the distribution of each PFAS congener across the study population and

210

then separately for firefighters and office workers and calculated summary statistics

211

including geometric mean (GM), 95% confidence intervals (CI), and percentiles. As is

212

common with environmental data, PFAS concentrations were non-normally distributed,

213

thus we used non-parametric methods (Wilcoxon rank-sum test) to test unadjusted

214

differences in PFAS concentrations between firefighters and office workers. We used

215

lognormal regression analyses to assess differences in PFAS concentrations between

216

firefighters and office workers, controlling for potential confounders. We then limited the

217

analysis to firefighters and used lognormal regression analyses to explore the

218

association between firefighter occupational activities and PFAS concentrations

219

controlling for potential confounders. Congeners with at least a 70% detection frequency

220

were included in the data analysis and we used maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

221

with the NADA R package to account for left censored data (data below the limit of

222

detection (LOD)) for all regression models.51

223
224

Potential confounders were identified a priori based on previous literature suggesting an

225

independent relationship with PFAS levels. We assessed the relationship between each

226

identified variable and PFAS levels in our data and tested differences between

227

firefighters and office workers for each potential confounder associated. Variables were

228

included in final regression models if there was a statistically significant association with

229

PFAS levels in our data and if the variable demonstrated a statistically significant

230

difference between firefighters and office workers (p-value £ 0.05) for at least one PFAS

231

congener.

232
233

We ran linear regression models to test the association between occupation and log-

234

transformed PFAS concentrations controlling for age, race and ethnicity, and education

235

(Model 1). A second model controlled for variables in Model 1 as well as consumption

236

frequency of fish and shellfish, red meat, poultry, fast-food or take-out food, and frozen

237

food heated in paper or cardboard packaging (Model 2). Exponentiated beta coefficients

238

estimate the proportional change in the PFAS geometric means associated with being a

239

firefighter compared to being an office worker and controlling for potential confounders.

240
241

We then limited our analysis to firefighters to evaluate the association between

242

firefighter practices in the workplace with PFAS levels adjusting for age, race and

243

ethnicity, and number of years of service with SFFD. Firefighter practices assessed

244

included use of self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) during salvage and

245

overhaul, use of firefighting foam, and the participants' assigned position (firefighter,

246

officer, driver). Likewise, because airport fire stations are required to stock, test and use

247

PFAS-containing firefighting foam due to federal regulations, we included an indicator

248

variable for those firefighters assigned to San Francisco Airport fire stations.52 We also

249

examined the relationship between PFAS concentrations and the frequency of

250

handwashing during a work shift and showering after a fire event, as well as the

251

relationship with responding to a fire within 24 hours and one year prior to providing a

252

biospecimen sample. Again, we exponentiated the beta coefficient to obtain the

253

proportional change in the PFAS geometric means associated with a unit change of

254

each dependent variable controlling for potential confounders.

255
256

Lastly, we evaluated how PFAS levels in our study population compared with those

257

measured in the general U.S. population and in firefighters in Southern California.

258

Specifically, we plotted the geometric mean (GM) and 95% confidence interval from the

259

WFBC firefighter and office worker groups and compared them to adult women from the

260

2013-2014 cycle of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)

261

and the Firefighter Occupational Exposure (FOX) study, in which samples were

262

collected from a cohort of mostly male firefighters in Southern California between 2010

263

and 2011.27,53,54 WFBC firefighter and office worker levels below the LOD were replaced

264

by the LOD reported for each congener divided by Ö2 to facilitate comparison of our

265

results to the FOX and NHANES cohorts, which also used this approach (LOD/Ö2).

266
267

All analyses were performed in R version 3.5.2 and R Studio 1.2.1335.55,56

268
269

Results:

270

176 participants were recruited into the study. Six individuals, (three firefighters and

271

three office workers) met the study inclusion criteria and were interviewed but did not

272

provide a blood sample and therefore were excluded from the analysis. Our final study

273

sample consisted of 86 firefighters and 84 office workers (N=170) (Table 1).

Firefighters and office workers had similar demographic characteristics in terms of age,

276

and racial/ethnic make-up, while a significantly higher proportion of office workers were

277

foreign born, married, and had higher levels of educational attainment. Firefighters had

278

an average of seven years of service with the SFFD while office workers had an

279

average of fourteen years of service with the City and County of San Francisco.

282

Occupational activities and characteristics of the firefighter group are shown in Table 2.

283

The majority of participants were assigned to the position of firefighter compared to

284

officer or driver positions, and thirteen firefighters were assigned to one of the San

285

Francisco airport fire stations. Most firefighters reported using firefighting foam during

286

their career as a firefighter and over half of participants reported rarely using their SCBA

287

during salvage and overhaul activities after a fire. When asked about recent fires, most

288

firefighters had not responded to a fire or participated in live-fire training in the 24 hours

289

prior to their biospecimen sample collection, while the SFFD fire history data indicated

290

that most firefighters had ten or more fires in the year prior to biospecimen collection.

Table 3 shows the LOD, detection frequency, GM (95%CI), and percentiles of each

294

PFAS compound analyzed. Of the twelve PFAS we measured in participants’ serum,

295

four congeners were not detected in any of the study participants (PFBA, PFHxA,

296

PFHpA, PFOSA). Eight PFAS had measurable levels, seven of which were detected in

297

at least 70% of study participants and four were detected in 100% of study participants

298

(PFHxS, PFNA, PFOA, and PFOS). We excluded PFDoA from further analyses since it

299

was detected in fewer than 25% of study participants. Distributional comparisons of

300

PFAS levels between WFBC firefighters and office workers for those compounds with

301

detection frequencies of at least 70% are shown in Figure S1. Levels of PFNA, PFHxS

302

and PFUnDA were statistically significantly higher among the firefighter group compared

303

to office workers.

Table 4 shows the results from multiple linear regression models assessing the

306

relationship between log-transformed PFAS concentrations and occupation, comparing

307

firefighters to office workers (referent) controlling for potential confounders (Tables S1

308

and S2). Multiple regression models found higher serum levels of PFHxS, PFUnDA and

309

PFNA among firefighters compared to office workers in both unadjusted in adjusted

310

models. PFHxS levels were 2.39 (95%CI = 1.64,3.48) times higher, PFUnDA levels

311

were 2.32 (95%CI = 1.17, 4.62) times higher and PFNA levels were 1.26 (95% CI =

312

0.99, 1.59) times higher in firefighters compared to office workers after adjusting for

313

age, race and ethnicity, educational attainment, as well as the frequency of

314

consumption of fish/shellfish, red meat, poultry, fast-food, food heated in packaging.

319

average serum levels of PFNA, PFOA, PFOS, PFDA and PFUnDA, while drivers had

320

higher average levels of PFBuS compared to those in officer and firefighter positions.

321

Firefighters assigned to the airport had higher levels of PFNA than those assigned to

322

other stations in the fire department. Likewise, firefighters who reported using

323

firefighting foam had elevated PFOA levels compared to those who reported never

324

using foams.

325
326

Surprisingly, using SCBA, washing hands during a work shift and showering after a fire

327

incident were associated with increased levels of some PFAS. Average PFNA and

328

PFUnDA concentrations were higher among participants who said they sometimes used

329

their SCBA during salvage/overhaul versus rarely or never. Similarly, average PFHxS

330

levels were higher among participants who said they washed their hands more

331

frequently or who responded that they always showered after a fire event compared to

332

those who washed hands or showered after a fire event the least often. Those who

333

washed their hands 16-20 times during a work shift had 2.81 (95%CI = 1.56, 5.07) times

334

higher concentration of PFHxS compared to those who reported washing their hands 10

335

times or less per shift. Those who reported always showering after a fire event had 2.01

336

(95% CI = 1.0, 4.03) times higher PFHxS levels compared to those who reported that

337

they sometimes showered.

frequencies of at least 70% among WFBC participants. PFBuS had low DF for FOX
(6.9%) and NHANES (0.7%); therefore, we plotted the LOD, represented by horizontal
green lines, in lieu of GM and 95% CI. We replaced levels below the LOD with LOD/√2
and applied the LOD respective to each study population. Tests of statistical
significance for differences between WFBC groups is shown in Table 4.

Figure 1 compares PFAS levels measured in our WFBC participants with other cohorts,

351

including adult women from the 2013-2014 NHANES54 and the predominantly male

352

2010-2011 FOX study.53 WFBC firefighters and office workers had higher serum levels

353

of PFHxS and a higher detection frequency for PFBuS than both NHANES and FOX;

354

while PFBuS had low detection frequencies in both the FOX and NHANES studies (DF:

355

6.9% and 0.7%, respectively) the WFBC had a PFBuS detection frequency of 74% for

356

firefighters and 70% for office workers. WFBC firefighters also had higher levels of

357

PFNA, PFDA and PFUnDA levels compared to NHANES, whereas office workers had

358

similar levels to NHANES for PFOS, PFOA and PFNA. Both WFBC firefighter and office

359

worker groups had lower levels of PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUnDA than

360

those measured in the FOX study.

361
362

Discussion:

363

This biomonitoring study is the first to assess levels of PFAS compounds in an all-

364

female cohort of firefighters and office workers. Of the twelve PFAS we measured,

365

detection frequencies ranged from 0 to 100% and all participants had at least four PFAS

366

congeners (PFHxS, PFOA, PFOS and PFNA) detected in their serum samples.

367

Widespread use of PFAS in consumer products, contamination of food and water

368

sources, and their environmental persistence may contribute to the high background

369

levels of these compounds in both firefighters and office workers. Indeed PFAS are

370

ubiquitous in the environment and have been found in dust, food and humans

371

worldwide.34,57 In addition, the widespread use of PFAS containing products on clothing,

people.48,58 Drinking water contamination is considered an important source of PFAS

374

exposure in many communities,48,59,60 and people with contaminated drinking water

375

have elevated PFAS in their blood.61 However, local San Francisco Bay Area water

376

systems are not likely to be a significant source of PFAS exposure for WFBC study

377

participants. Municipal water systems in the locations where most study participants live

378

were tested for PFAS under the Environmental Protection Agency’s Unregulated

379

Contaminant Monitoring Rule in 2016 and tests did not detect measurable PFAS

380

contamination in San Francisco or surrounding communities’ municipal water systems.62

381
382

Multivariate models showed that PFHxS, PFUnDA, and PFNA exposure was higher in

383

firefighters compared to office workers after controlling for age, race and ethnicity.

384

When we additionally controlled for the frequency of eating certain foods the association

385

remained significantly higher in firefighters compared to office workers and the strength

386

of association became stronger after adjustment for potential confounders. When we

387

limited the analysis to firefighters, we found that several occupational activities were

388

associated with higher PFAS levels. Firefighters’ assigned position was the most

389

strongly associated with higher PFAS levels, with those assigned as firefighters or

390

officers having higher levels of PFNA, PFOA, PFDA and PFUnDA compared to drivers.

391

Compared to drivers, PFOS was higher among those assigned to the firefighter position

392

however, PFBuS was higher among drivers compared to officers. Differential PFAS

393

exposures by position may be explained by different roles at fire events. Engine drivers

394

typically remain with the apparatus because they supply water for initial interior fire

395

suppression work, as well as set the ladders for ventilation procedures. In addition,

396

drivers in SFFD do not typically perform overhaul procedures after a fire is extinguished,

397

and thus may avoid a critical source of exposure.63

398
399

Firefighting foams may be another important source of PFAS exposure. Aqueous Film

400

Forming Foams (AFFF) are known to contain PFAS surfactants, including PFOS, PFOA

401

and PFHxS.19,64 Our data suggest that firefighters who reported using firefighting foam

402

had higher levels of PFOA than those who reported never using firefighting foams.

403

Among airport firefighters, we found that PFNA levels were two times higher compared

404

to firefighters assigned to other stations in San Francisco. Although PFNA is not

405

considered a main ingredient in AFFF, a study in Finland found that firefighters using

406

AFFF in training activities had increased levels of PFNA after the training activities.19

407
408

Unexpectedly, procedures that generally are intended to reduce contaminant exposures

409

were associated with increased exposures for some PFAS. Washing hands more

410

frequently during the work shift and always showering after a fire event were associated

411

with increased PFHxS levels while sometimes using SCBA during salvage overhaul was

412

associated with increased PFNA, PFDA and PFUnDA. One possible explanation is that

413

firefighters may be over-reporting their hand washing, showering frequency, and SCBA

414

use because they know that these activities are expected occupational hygiene

415

practices. Duration of SCBA use during fire events may also be an important factor to

416

examine in future studies, as it is possible that although firefighters may wear SCBA

417

frequently, they may remove it after extinguishing a fire and during salvage and

418

overhaul operations because gear is heavy, conditions are hot, and the location

419

appears to be free of smoke.14,63 Self-reporting bias in terms of occupational safety and

420

health procedures, which has been shown in other studies settings,65,66 may have also

421

affected our results. In addition, there may be unknown and unmeasured occupational

422

sources of PFAS exposure in firefighting that could help explain observed associations.

423
424

We compared the levels of PFAS congeners in WFBC participants with levels from two

425

other exposure studies: A cohort of mostly male firefighters in Southern California (FOX)

426

and a nationally representative sample of adult women (NHANES). In general, WFBC

427

firefighters and office workers had lower PFAS levels than those measured in the FOX

428

study, except for PFHxS which was significantly higher in both WFBC firefighters and

429

office workers. In particular, the lower levels of PFOA and PFOS in the WFBC

430

participants may reflect the temporal trends associated with the phase-out of these

431

compounds in consumer products and firefighting equipment. The FOX study samples

432

were collected between 2010 and 2011, three years before the start of the WFBC study

433

and during the phase out period of PFOA and PFOS.67 Studies have shown that PFAS

434

levels have changed over time with many PFAS that have been phased out decreasing

435

and their replacements increasing.36,37,68,69 Interestingly, we did see overall higher levels

436

of PFHxS in both groups of WFBC participants collected in 2013-2014 relative to the

437

2010-2011 FOX cohort. The increased levels in WFBC participants may be due to

438

PFHxS’ long half-life or other continued sources of PFHxS exposures in California

439

residents.68 The elevated levels among WFBC firefighters in relation to FOX participants

440

may be due, in part, to its use as a replacement for PFOA and PFOS in firefighting

441

foams.64 Additionally, the lower levels of most PFAS among WFBC participants

442

compared to the mostly male cohort of FOX participants may be further explained by

443

excretion pathway differences between men and women, where women may have

444

lower PFAS levels due to excretion during menstruation.70

445
446

WFBC and NHANES data were collected at around the same time (2013-14 for

447

NHANES and 2014-15 for the WFBC) and levels between WFBC and NHANES were

448

more similar to each other than with the FOX study. However, PFHxS, PFDA, and

449

PFBuS levels were higher in WFBC firefighters and office workers compared to

450

NHANES adult women. While we limited the NHANES cohort to adult women, we did

451

not consider occupation or other factors, including location or other potential exposure

452

sources.

453
454

Health effects observed in people exposed to PFOA include high cholesterol, ulcerative

455

colitis, thyroid disease, testicular and kidney cancers, and pregnancy-induced

456

hypertension.71 PFOS exposure has also been associated with immunotoxicity, as

457

indicated by a decreased response to vaccine in children;72 and other studies of people

458

exposed to PFAS show effects on liver and decreased birth weight.73 In animal studies,

459

PFAS have been shown to have a variety of similar toxicological effects including liver

460

toxicity, suppressed immune function, altered mammary gland development, obesity,

461

and cancer.74,75 The concordance between endpoints identified in animal studies and

462

human studies, most notably effects on liver, kidney, fetal growth and development, and

463

suppression of the immune system, add confidence to the findings.76,77 Based on these

464

studies in humans and animals, some government agencies have established allowable

465

levels of PFOA and PFOS in drinking water.76,78 For PFOA, these benchmarks are

466

designed to prevent people from having blood serum levels above 14 ng/ml.79 The

467

maximum value in this study was 5 ng/mL. However, PFOA has been shown to alter

468

mammary gland development in mice following in utero exposure at even lower levels,

469

and estimates of target serum levels to protect against those effects are less than 1

470

ng/ml79. The health effects of the other PFAS found in elevated levels in firefighters

471

have not been well studied and target serum concentrations that are expected to protect

472

against adverse effects are not available for PFNA, PFBuS, PFHxS, PFUnDA, so it is

473

difficult to compare measured levels in firefighters with benchmarks intended to protect

474

against health effects. Allowable daily intake amounts intended to protect against

475

adverse health effects are in the same range as PFOA for PFNA, while for PFHxS they

476

are about 10 times higher and for PFBuS they are 100 times higher.80 However the

477

higher allowable daily intakes for PFBuS and PFHxS do not necessarily correspond to

478

higher allowable serum levels for these chemicals. Instead they reflect differences in the

479

relationship between intake and serum concentration for each of the chemicals.

480
481

We used a community-based participatory research design that entailed the active

482

involvement of firefighters to recruit participants (both firefighters and office workers)

483

into the study. By including office workers from the City and County of San Francisco

484

we were able to compare firefighter exposures to a working population of women who

485

were not involved in firefighting activities, but who live and work in the same

486

geographical region allowing us to examine which PFAS chemicals are most strongly

487

associated with firefighting. Understanding the extent to which PFAS exposures differ

488

between firefighters and office workers can elucidate which compounds are likely to

489

have occupational sources, highlight opportunities for prevention strategies, and assess

490

the effectiveness of workplace exposure reduction efforts.

491
492

Conclusion:

493

Our study found ubiquitous exposures to multiple PFAS compounds among all

494

participants of the Women Firefighter Biomonitoring Collaborative. Firefighters were

495

exposed to higher levels of PFNA, PFHxS and PFUnDA than office workers indicating

496

potential occupational sources for firefighters. While industrial hygiene practices, use

497

and access to personal protective equipment, use of AFFF foam, and other

498

occupational conditions may vary across fire departments and fire events, our results

499

have relevance for understanding potential sources and pathways of chemical

500

exposures for other fire departments and regions. Further study is warranted to better

501

understand exposure patterns and health risks for firefighters associated with these

502

compounds.
