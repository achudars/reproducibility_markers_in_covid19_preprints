Abstract

28

Objective. Goodman and Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (GGPBT) has been a

29

cornerstone in the education of pharmacists, physicians, and pharmacologists for decades. The objectives

30

of this report were to describe and evaluate the 13th edition of GGPBT including: 1) author characteristics;

31

2) recency of citations; 3) conflict of interest (CoI) disclosure, and 4) expert evaluation of chapters.

32

Methods. Contributors’ (N = 115) sex, professional degrees, and presence of undisclosed potential CoI as

33

reported by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid’s Open Payments (2013 to 2017) were examined. Year

34

of publication of citations were extracted relative to comparison textbooks (Katzung’s Basic and Clinical

35

Pharmacology (KatBCP), and DiPiro’s Pharmacotherapy: A Pathophysiologic Approach (DiPPAPA).

36

Content experts in pharmacy and pharmacology education provided chapter reviews.

37

Results. The percent of GGPBT contributors that were female (20.9%) was equivalent to those in KatBCP

38

(17.0%). Citations in GGPBT (11.5 + 0.2 years) were significantly older than those in KatBCP (10.4 + 0.2)

39

and DiPPAPA (9.1 + 0.1, p < .0001). Contributors to GGPBT received three million in undisclosed

40

remuneration from pharmaceutical companies (Maximum author = $743,718). In contrast, DiPPAPA made

41

CoI information available. However, self-reported disclosures were not uniformly congruent with Open

42

Payments reported data. Reviewers noted several strengths but also some areas for improvement.

43

Conclusion: GGPBT will continue to be an important component of the biomedical curriculum. Areas of

44

improvement include more diverse authorship, improved conflict of interest transparency, and greater

45

inclusion of more recent citations.

INTRODUCTION

51

Educator and pharmacologist Louis S. Goodman (1906 – 2000) completed his undergraduate

52

degree at Reed College and his MD at the University of Oregon Medical School in Portland, Oregon.

53

Goodman and Alfred Gilman, his colleague and collaborator on nitrogen mustard investigations,

54

published the first edition of Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (GGPBT) in 1941. Louis’s son Alfred

55

G (Goodman) Gilman (1941- 2015) received a Nobel prize for his work on signal transduction and served

56

in various editorial capacities for the 5th to 10th editions. The first reviewer was “delirious in his appraisal

57

of the book” and anticipated it would become the standard text in pharmacology.1 The eighteen hundred

58

page 2nd edition published in 1956 was referred to as encyclopedic and indispensable.2 A reviewer noted

59

that “all other related books seem to pale by comparison”.3 An evaluation of the 6th edition published in

60

1980 commended the extensive bibliography but was more measured and noted that although “this book

61

is recommended to all those who prescribe drugs”, GGPBT had become “too large to be used by medical

62

students as a routine textbook”.4 Hastings and Long referred to GGPBT as the “blue bible of

63

pharmacology” and the “gold standard”.5 Rosenberg warmly commended this reference for dentistry and

64

anesthesiology.6 However, despite the book’s esteemed and authoritative status, a subsequent reviewer

65

alluded to one chapter where the text had “barely kept up” with the rapid pace of new therapeutic

66

developments. Casavant also noted the omission of twenty of twenty-six newly approved medications in

67

the 10th edition7. The paucity of female authors and absence of potential conflict of interest (CoI)

68

disclosure were concerns expressed about the 12th edition published in 2012.8

69

An under-representation of females as authors has been identified in different fields and types of

70

publications. Female first authorship in six, high-impact, general medical journals increased from 27% in

71

1994 to 37% in 2014.9 Senior authorship by women in cardiology journals doubled from 6% in 1996 to

72

12% in 2016.10 Textbook authorship, which often involves large teams, is highly variable and ranged

73

from half (53%) female for an advanced pharmacy textbook, the 2014 9th edition of DiPiro’s

76

Conflicts of interest (CoIs) were defined as “a set of circumstances that creates a risk that

77

professional judgment or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary

78

interest”.13 The transparency of conflicts of interest has become increasingly ubiquitous for primary

79

sources14 including clinical trials,15 undergraduate medical education,16 continuing medical education,17

80

point of care computerized sources,18 meta-analyses,19 and clinical practice guidelines.20 The US

81

Physician Payments Sunshine Act of 2010 required that all compensation ( > $10) to doctors of medicine,

82

osteopathy, dentistry, dental surgery, podiatry, optometry, and chiropractic medicine (i.e. PharmDs, PhDs,

83

PAs, and NPs were not covered although this subsequently changed for PAs and NPs) by manufacturers

84

of drugs and medical devices be reported to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and

85

made available on its public website. Disclosure of conflicts of interest was provided in the preface to a

86

psychopharmacology textbook21 and in DiPiro’s Pharmacotherapy: A Pathophysiological Approach but

87

this practice is currently uncommon. The database, ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs (PDD), originally

88

covered only fifteen pharmaceutical companies. Using the first generation of this database, we found that

89

authors and editors of four biomedical textbooks had received $2.4 million, primarily for speaking and

90

consulting, which was undisclosed to readers. One-quarter of the contributors to GGPBT, 12th edition, had

91

an undisclosed patent.8

92

Here, we extend upon earlier educational research8, 12 by assessing the most recent (2018, 13th

93

edition) of GGPBT. This includes quantitative descriptive measures of author characteristics (education,

94

sex), a citation analysis relative to other pharmacology (KatBCP) and pharmacotherapy (DiPPAPA)

95

textbooks and characterizing the presence of potential CoI using more comprehensive databases. Content

96

experts also provided detailed assessments in their specialty areas.

99

Procedures. The contributors page of the 13th edition of Goodman and Gilman’s The

100

Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (GGPBT) 22 was consulted to obtain professional degrees of

101

authors and editors (N = 115). Sex was determined by a Google search or consulting the National

102

Provider Identifier (https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Administrative-

103

Simplification/NationalProvIdentStand/). The presence of CoI was deemed exempt by the Wright Center

104

Institutional Review Board and evaluated with two publically available databases, the Center for

105

Medicare and Medicaid Service’s Open Payments (CMSOP) and ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs (PPDD).

106

These databases differ slightly with respect to when potential CoI information is made available and to

107

details (e.g. specific companies and products) about disclosures, with ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs being

108

updated less frequently but providing greater depth. Payments were obtained for 2013 to 2017. The

109

second generation of PPDD reported on $9.2 billion in payments from two-thousand companies to nine-

110

hundred thousand physicians. Among GGPBT authors with a US affiliation (N = 109), 42.3% had

111

professional degrees that were covered by the Sunshine Act (i.e. PhDs and PharmDs were not covered).

112

Year of publication of each reference for 72 chapters including the Appendix (N = 3,576) was obtained.

113

The publication year of all citations of Katzung’s Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (KatBCP, 2018, N =

114

1,777)23 and DipPAPA (9th ed., 2017, N = 13,389)11 including eChapters were also obtained for

115

comparison.

116

For the narrative reviews, content experts were consulted. Experts included academic

117

pharmacists, physiologists, molecular biologists, a psychiatry resident, a neuroscientist, a neurologist, and

118

a bioinformaticist. Experts were instructed to succinctly provide strengths and limitations and, if

119

applicable, to make comparisons with other textbooks they use. Some provided assessments of a specific

120

chapter, others provided an evaluation of an entire section. Two recent graduates from a Master’s in

121

Biomedical Sciences program provided student perspectives. The goal was not to be comprehensive of all

122

71 chapters but instead to provide at least a sampling from most sections.

123

Data-analysis. Statistical analysis was completed with Systat, version 13.1 with p < .05

124

considered significant. Figures were prepared with GraphPad Prism. Sex of contributors of GGPBT was

125

compared to other pharmacy and biomedical textbooks obtained previously.8, 11 Age of references was

126

calculated as the difference between publication year and the copyright year. The similarity between CoI

127

databases was evaluated with a Pearson correlation and t-test. Variability was expressed as the SEM with

128

a p < .05 considered statistically significant.

RESULTS

131

1. Quantitative

132

In Goodman and Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (GGPBT), there were 115

133

authors, of which 32 contributed to more than one chapter. The highest degree was MD for half of authors

134

(47.0%), PhD for two-fifths (45.2%), and the remainder (7.8%) PharmDs. The preponderance (90.4%) of

135

authors were based in the US.

136

One-fifth (20.9%) of authors were female or 19.0% if including multiple chapter contributions.

137

Female authorship in GGPBT was equivalent to that of Katzung’s Basic and Clinical Pharmacology

138

(KatBCP, 17.0%, p = .52) but less than Remington’s Science and Practice of Pharmacy (37.0%, χ2(1) =

139

8.84, p < .003) and Koda-Kimble and Young’s Applied Therapeutics (53.0%, χ2(1) = 8.84, p < .001).

140

Figure 1A shows that references in GGPBT were 12.3% older (11.5 years) than those in TKBCP

141

(10.4, t(5,321) = 4.42, p < .0005). The DiPiro’s Pharmacotherapy: A Pathophysiological Approach

142

(DiPPAPA) citations (9.1 years) were also more recent than GGPBT (t(16,951) = 15.59, p < .0001).

143

Similarly, additional analysis determined that more references were > a decade old for GGPBT (49.1%)

144

compared to KatBCP (44.7%, χ2(1) = 9.20, p < .002) or DiPPAPA (34.0%, χ2(1) = 278.21, p < .0001).

145

KatBCP

146

reference age by section of GGPBT. The Drugs Affecting Gastrointestinal Function were significantly

147

newer than all other sections. Conversely, Neuropharmacology references were 6.7 years older than

148

Gastrointestinal and also significantly less recent than all other sections. There were some broad

149

similarities between GGPBT and KatBCP (Figure 1C) with oncology citations being more recent,

also differed from DiPPAPA on this measure (χ2(1) = 78.44, p < .0001). Figure 1B depicts

150

endocrinology intermediate, and neuroscience the oldest. The gastrointestinal, as well as gynecological,

151

citations were most recent relative to many other sections in DiPPAPA (Figure 1D).

152

The similarity of the conflict of interest databases ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs (PPDD) and

153

Medicaid Service’s Open Payments (CMSOP) was examined with two complementary analyses. The

154

correlation between the total received from 2013 to 2016 (i.e. the most recent available in both databases)

155

was high (r(24) = +0.999, p < .0005; Supplementary Figure 1). However, the mean amount received was

156

eighteen-hundred dollars higher for CMSOP ($82,923 + 24,404) than PPDD ($81,105 + 24,122), a non-

157

significant difference (t(25) = 1.59, p = .13).

158

Total undisclosed remuneration received by twenty-seven GGPBT authors (57.4% of eligible US

159

based physician-authors, 96.3% male, Minimum = $23, Maximum = $743,718) from 2013 to 2017 was

160

$2.97 million of which almost three-quarters (71.4%) went to the top five authors. The most compensated

161

author received $493,536 (66.0% of their total) for royalty or licenses and $250,108 (34.0%) for

162

ownership or investment interest. One of the dermatological pharmacology authors received $493,536 for

163

ivermectin, a head lice treatment. The psychosis and mania chapter author received $238,413 for

164

payments related to two atypical antipsychotics. The oncologist author of “Hormones and Related Agents

165

in the Therapy of Cancer” received $228,493 for five breast cancer agents.

166

Additional analyses were completed on DiPPAPA which provides CoI information. Approximately

167

one out of every twelve contributors (20/233 or 8.6%) self-reported a potential CoI. Among the 35

168

eligible (MD or DO with a US affiliation) authors, 74.3% had a PPDD entry (Min = $14, Max = $729,695,

169

total = $1.8 million). However, some discrepancies were identified. A status epilepticus author whose

170

disclosures were self-reported as “none” received a half-million for anti-epilepsy drugs according to

171

PPDD.

172

relevant remuneration from 2013 to 2016 (Supplemental Table 1).

173

2. Narrative Reviews

Two authors who did not report disclosures to DiPPAPA accepted $70-350 thousand in potentially

174

Open-ended evaluations were provided on sixteen chapters including representation of seven of

175

the nine sections of Goodman and Gilman’s The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (GGPBT).

176

2.1 General Principles

177

Chapter 2, “Pharmacokinetics: The Dynamics of Drug Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, and

178

Elimination” is a comprehensive and thorough explanation and discussion of the basic concepts of

179

pharmacokinetics. The characteristics and processes of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and

180

elimination are reviewed respectively, including an in-depth discussion of the types of transport across

181

membranes and the influence of pH. The first-pass effect as well as the benefits and limitations of various

182

routes of drug administration are also explored. Potentially beneficial additions to the discussion are

183

further examples of specific drugs and their routes of administration, as well as the factors that influence

184

onset of action. There is a brief discussion of rectal administration that could be improved by expanding

185

upon the reasoning behind its incomplete and irregular absorption. Distribution is briefly explored,

186

including a discussion of the differences of distribution among various types of tissues as well as an

187

explanation of protein and tissue binding. While the bone portion of this section focuses mostly on

188

tetracycline antibiotics, an introduction to the pathophysiologic changes in bone that make distribution

189

difficult overall would be helpful. The next section on metabolism is a simplistic but comprehensive

190

explanation of phase one and two reactions, as well as first and zero-order kinetics. A potentially

191

beneficial supplement to this section could be to include examples of when products of metabolism make

192

the drug more toxic (eg. acetaminophen toxicity). The excretion section focuses primarily on renal

193

excretion but also includes that by other routes. Learning is aided by highly beneficial figures that depict

194

renal drug handling and a helpful visual of the afferent and efferent arterioles. A recommendation for

195

improvement is to move the discussion of drugs in breast milk to the distribution section. While placental

196

transfer is discussed in the distribution section, breast milk distribution and potential for ion trapping is

197

not. Tissue distribution is more relevant than elimination when discussing drugs in breast milk. The final

198

section discusses clinical pharmacokinetics and the “four most important parameters governing drug

199

disposition.” While this section is extensive and includes strong drug examples to explain clinical

8

200

pharmacokinetics, it could be confusing to the reader that components of “clinical pharmacokinetics” are

201

separated from ADME. It may be beneficial to integrate this section into earlier content. Some examples

202

include moving the discussion of extent and rate of absorption under absorption, clearance under

203

excretion, and volume of distribution under distribution. There is a helpful explanation of maintenance

204

and loading doses, therapeutic window, and dosing intervals along with drug examples with each.

205

However, the explanation of therapeutic drug monitoring is somewhat limited and potentially too

206

generalized. Additional examples of therapeutic drug monitoring (for example, a comparison of

207

therapeutic drug monitoring used for vancomycin, aminoglycosides, and warfarin) would be beneficial to

208

the reader in order to understand the parameters that influence different timing and results of monitoring.

209

Chapter 3, “Pharmacodynamics: The Molecular Mechanisms of Drug Action” includes a

210

comprehensive and highly detailed discussion of three primary areas of pharmacodynamics including

211

basic concepts, mechanisms of drug action, and signaling pathways. The first section provides a detailed

212

explanation of different receptor types as well as a short discussion of the increased development of

213

biologic agents. The definitions of agonists, antagonists, and their subtypes are provided. A useful

214

addition to this section would be drug examples of agonists, antagonists, and their subtypes in order to

215

illustrate these concepts further. Specificity of drug receptors and tachyphylaxis are explored, followed by

216

a detailed explanation of affinity, efficacy, and potency. Graphs and mathematical models are used to

217

elaborate upon these concepts. Individual and population pharmacodynamics as well as factors that affect

218

the variability of drug dosing are included. There is also a useful section that expands on the individual

219

patient characteristics that contribute to variability of dosing. There is a section on drug interactions, but it

220

does not mention the effect of CYP enzymes on drug interactions. While this is typically categorized in

221

pharmacokinetics, it may be beneficial to mention their substantial effects on drug levels here. The

222

following section explores the mechanisms of drug action, and expands upon the effects of drugs on

223

ligands, extracellular responses, intracellular pathways, and ions. The mechanisms of anti-infective drugs

224

are also reviewed, which can potentially be eliminated in the overall discussion, or converted to an

225

example instead. There is a helpful review of the structure and function of specific receptor types

9

226

including second messenger systems and other signaling pathways. Tachyphylaxis and desensitization are

227

discussed again here and could be more beneficial if the discussions on this topic were condensed to one

228

area of the chapter. The chapter ends with an extensively detailed exploration of diseases associated with

229

transcription and translation along with the pharmacotherapies that treat them. Considering that this is an

230

introductory chapter on pharmacodynamics, it may be more useful for this information to be included at a

231

later point in the book. It may be advantageous to consider narrowing this topic to only basic

232

pharmacodynamic concepts.

233

The General Principles section further includes Chapter 7, “Pharmacogenetics”, which provides

234

an overview of the terminology and principles that describe the genetic variations that contribute to drug

235

response phenotypes. A description of the applications of individual genotyping data to inform clinical

236

decisions is provided. Different types of genetic variations which can affect drug response phenotypes are

237

outlined. Each type of genetic variation is linked to a description regarding a change in biological

238

function, which in turn is linked to the phenotype. Emphasis is thereby placed on interpreting the genetic

239

variations in terms of the anticipated functional consequences.

240

As a possible improvement, a further systematic categorization of the linkages between genetic

241

variations and drug response phenotypes may be provided. Consider the categorizations of the linkages

242

given by Katsila et al. 33 The linkages are described in terms of the overall genetic category (poor

243

metabolizer, extensive metabolizer, therapeutic target etc.), the functional effect, the possible phenotype

244

associated with an active drug, and the possible phenotype associated if a pro-drug. Such categorization

245

may help the reader to gain better understanding of apparent themes in the drug response phenotypes. For

246

example, regarding prodrugs, the reader may further expect that an adverse effect would occur in the

247

presence of the drug-activating enzyme that has a relatively high activity.

248

Chapter 7 also advances an understanding of the functional consequences of genetic variations in

249

terms of complete or partial loss of function. A discussion of the increased relative effects of variations at

250

positions with different levels of evolutionary conservation is provided. But in the previous (12 th) edition

251

of Goodman and Gilman’s Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (GGPBT), there was greater

10

252

delineation of the descriptions of evolutionary conservation versus chemical conservation. It may be

253

helpful to reintroduce that back into the chapter to clarify these important concepts. It may then become

254

clearer that positions in a protein which are highly evolutionary conserved may not allow for an amino

255

acid which is chemically similar if that substituted residue does not enable the protein’s specific

256

function.34 In the previous edition , it was more evident that one would need to consider evolutionary

257

conservation and chemical similarity in a somewhat separate light.

258

As a welcome addition to the current edition, there was an informative discussion of the need to

259

consider common versus rare variations of a population when assessing the effects on drug response

260

phenotypes. Discussions are provided regarding how studies are designed to detect common variations

261

and rare variations using candidate gene association studies and genome-wide association studies. It is

262

made apparent that both rare and common variations will need to be considered when predicting the drug

263

response phenotypes. The changes from the 12th edition to the 13th edition with regards to the inclusion

264

of the effects of rare and common variants appear to be due in part to changes the contributing authors.

265

For the 12th edition, the authors were Mary V. Relling and Kathleen Giancomini, while the author for the

266

13th edition is Dan Roden, whose research focus is on characterizing such variations.

267

The number and breadth of the described genetic variations provide the reader with an

268

appreciation how pharmacogenomic information will be used to predict drug response phenotypes and to

269

inform treatment strategies. Consider Table 7-2, entitled “Examples of Genetic Polymorphisms

270

Influencing Drug Response”. The presentation of the example drugs provides the reader incentives to

271

understand the related topics which are presented throughout the remainder of the textbook. To aid with

272

that, hyperlinks may be added to Table 7-2 that connect to these topics.

2.2 Neuropharmacology
Chapter 15, Drug Therapy of Depression and Anxiety Disorders, includes several strengths.

Figure 15.1 illustrates detailed information about the variety of antidepressant mechanisms or action. It

278

time” in the synapse. The development of ketamine and other approaches as novel antidepressants are

279

well described. Information about pharmacokinetics and CYP action is helpful in a practical way to

280

predict, and avoid, drug interaction. This chapter provides a general summary of the basic treatments for

281

anxiety and depression.

282

As a weakness, chapter 15 does not place very much emphasis on the dopamine or histamine

283

systems/actions in antidepressant effects or depressive etiology. Information about side effects,

284

therapeutic lab, wash-out periods, serotonin syndrome and discontinuation effects are dispersed

285

throughout the text and are not highlighted or emphasized as key pieces of information in designing a

286

treatment strategy. At the beginning of the chapter, depression is immediately categorized into bipolar I

287

and II. It might be more accurate to introduce mood disorders more generally, with an emphasis on

288

depressive symptoms/diagnoses. The authors suggest that there has been limited progress in developing

289

animal models sensitive to antidepressants and anxiolytics. Anxiety is described as “a normal human

290

emotion that serves an adaptive function,” however depression is not.

291

Another concern is that there are places where information is presented without research citations,

292

such as “Anxious patients appear to be particularly prone to severe discontinuation reactions with certain

293

medications such as venlafaxine and paroxetine; therefore, slow-tapering is required.” The chapter does

294

not include information about options for drug-treatment-resistant symptoms or suggestions for

295

combination approaches.21 As this is a pharmacology text, that is reasonable. However, it might be helpful

296

to have at least mention of electroconvulsive therapy or transcranial magnetic stimulation, so readers are

297

better informed of other options if drug treatment has been unsuccessful. More specialized textbooks21

298

provide at least a nod that the nomenclature for the “Selective” Serotonin Reuptake Uptake Inhibitors is

299

an inaccurate oversimplification.24

300

Chapter 20, “Opioids, analgesia, and pain management” is well organized and includes an

301

emphasis on history, receptor signaling, the pathophysiology of pain, tolerance, withdrawal, and medical

302

chemistry for this important drug class. On rare occasions, there is some unusual content and minor areas

303

for reconsideration. Mentioning that opioids do not bind to sigma receptors, twice, may be less useful for

12

304

new members of the field. The space devoted to specific opioids does not show any simple relationship

305

with their current use patterns.25 Meperidine and normeperidine, despite concerns with CNS excitation

306

and seizures, are mentioned four times more commonly than the ubiquitous hydrocodone. Tramadol is

307

described, twice, as a “weak opiate agonist”. Katzung’s Basic and Clinical Pharmacology (KatBCP) and

308

others have a more nuanced description of the mechanism of action of this agent and the importance of

309

desmethyltramadol.26 The term “addict” or “addicts” are used eight times versus zero for the less

310

stigmatizing “opioid use disorder”.27

311

Chapter 23 “Ethanol” begins with a brief description about the historical use of alcohol in human

312

civilization as well as epidemiologic overview of problems associated with it; this is quite helpful. There

313

also is a practical overview about alcohol content of different beverages as well as information about

314

estimating the blood ethanol concentration in end expiratory alveolar air. Excellent sections with

315

pharmacological properties of methanol and ethanol and its effects are arranged by system. The addition

316

of a Shakespearean quote added emphasis and served as a nice anecdote to illustrate the overview. This is

317

also a good overview about the postulated neurological pathways that are thought to be involved in

318

tolerance and dependence. Descriptions of teratogenicity, genetics, and drug interactions are adequate.

319

Information about treatment of alcohol withdrawal is lacking. No information about choice of drug

320

therapy for withdrawal as well as symptoms triggered therapy protocols (the Clinical Institute Withdrawal

321

Assessment or CIWA protocol for example) for assessment and treatment is provided. This is a surprising

322

omission as alcohol withdrawal is very prevalent and is associated with considerably increased mortality

323

and morbidity as compared to opioid withdrawal.

324

2.3 Modulation of pulmonary, renal, and cardiovascular function

325

Chapter 25 has the challenging task of introducing normal renal structure and function as a basis

326

for the mechanistic understanding of drugs that affect the renal excretory function. The chapter does an

327

incredible job in covering clinically relevant renal concepts. However, it is somewhat arbitrary in what is

328

introduced in the chapter’s introduction as “normal” and what is mentioned later, because it is necessary

329

to mention to understand the mechanics of diuretics and other drugs. Some figures and tables are very

13

330

helpful (e.g., Table 25-1), while others are overloaded and do not add much value (e.g. Figure 25-2).

331

Overall, it is a good chapter, despite the fact that every pathophysiologist will miss some mechanistic

332

understanding of normal (e.g., Mg2+ reabsorption) or abnormal processes (e.g. reduction of urinary Ca2+

333

excretion by thiazide diuretics).

334

2.4 Hormones and hormone antagonists

335

Chapter 48 “Agents Affecting Mineral Ion Homeostasis and Bone Turnover” provides a thorough

336

review of pharmacological agents used in treating and preventing mineral ion imbalances and bone

337

metabolism. The tables and figures are highly useful and summarize the main points of discussion,

338

particularly the drug summary table at the end of the chapter, which provides a quick reference for

339

understanding the pharmacological agents, their uses, and their clinical effects. This chapter will be useful

340

for both the medical student and seasoned healthcare professional in that in addition to discussing all of

341

the major pharmacological players involved in treating ion and bone diseases, it makes great attempts to

342

review and contextualize these treatment approaches by providing significant background information.

343

For example, this chapter contains a review of the basic hormonal control mechanisms involved in ion

344

homeostasis, target organs/systems, relevant bone cell physiology, and summary of the biology of

345

disorders of mineral homeostasis and bone. The chapter focuses on general concepts that have high

346

relevance in the clinical setting and are useful for directly understanding the underlying pharmacology.

347

This approach, while on the whole effective, does sometimes come at the expense of missing some

348

detailed but relevant information. For example, the chapter really does not discuss osteoclast function in

349

depth or bone resorption/remodeling effectively which would aid in the reader’s understanding of drugs

350

like bisphosphonates. This chapter also contains a decent summary discussing the integrated approach to

351

prevention and treatment of osteoporosis. This section does a more than adequate job of generally

352

summarizing the field with respect to the treatment strategies used for managing and preventing

353

osteoporosis.

354

2.5 Gastrointestinal (GI) pharmacology

355

Chapters 49 through 51 focus on gastrointestinal (GI) disorders. There are several positive aspects

356

to these chapters. First, the physiology and pathogenesis overview of each chapter and pharmacology of

357

each medication class is brief yet manages to remain quite detailed. The use of figures throughout allows

358

information to be more easily digested. Also, as a new text, this resource incorporates information on

359

recently approved agents, including medications like eluxadoline (Viberzi®) and vedolizumab (Entyvio®),

360

which naturally would be omitted by older resources. Finally, information on each drug and drug class

361

appears complete and accurate. Even adverse events recently identified by newer studies, like dementia

362

and chronic kidney disease for proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), are included.

363

On the other hand, there are several drawbacks as well. This section groups a large number of

364

topics into a small number of chapters, which could make readings challenging to assign to students. For

365

instance, to discuss a topic like Helicobacter pylori infection, one must first learn about PPIs early in

366

Chapter 49, then navigate through about two-thirds of the chapter before finally coming across a brief

367

discussion on managing the disorder.

368

The organization of Chapter 50, which covers motility disorders, emesis, and biliary and

369

pancreatic disease, is particularly hard to follow. The chapter begins by introducing antimotility agents

370

used in small populations and only available through limited access programs, if at all. Meanwhile, very

371

common motility disorders like diarrhea and constipation are buried throughout the lengthy chapter. Also,

372

the complications of cirrhosis, an important GI disorder, are mixed in only in short blurbs and in a

373

confusing manner throughout the chapter. A more complete discussion is vital and its absence is a

374

concerning flaw of this section.

375

Also, while it may be fitting to limit or omit information on medical interventions, such as

376

fundoplication surgery, there is limited coverage on nonpharmacologic interventions, which are some of

377

the most common and important recommendations pharmacists can make to patients. Additionally, some

378

aspects of these chapters assume a baseline understanding, which may not be beneficial for students who

379

do not possess this prior knowledge. For instance, terms like distal proctitis are left undefined, yet are

380

used freely when describing the therapeutic role of certain agents. Finally, compared to other resources,

15

381

this section uses fewer tables, making differences between medications or diseases more difficult to

382

establish.

383

Overall, chapters 49 to 51 allow individuals to build a strong foundation in pharmacologic

384

treatment of GI disorders by providing a great deal of information in a small number of chapters.

385

However, this section is not without its flaws. Improvement is needed with regard to organization,

386

coverage of cirrhosis, information on nonpharmacologic interventions, and the use of tables to present

387

data.

388

2.6 Chemotherapy of infectious diseases

389

Chapters 52, 56, 57 and 58 focus on infectious diseases. Chapter 52 is a general chapter focusing

390

on the general principles of antibacterial therapy. There are a few positive aspects to this chapter

391

including the step by step description of which antibiotic type (prophylactic, definitive, suppressive, etc.)

392

should be utilized in the ID process and detailed explanations of each type. The overview of the

393

pharmacokinetics of antibiotics is very detailed and the use of figures throughout the descriptions

394

provides visual explanations to better understand the information. The explanation on medication

395

resistance is very thorough and ensures that detailed information for resistance of each medication class

396

does not have to be discussed in each respective chapter.

397

Chapter 52, general principles of antimicrobial therapy, was very informative but does have some

398

disadvantages which make it somewhat difficult to follow. The pharmacokinetics section, though detailed

399

and useful, covers information beyond the need of healthcare providers. The descriptions of Emax and Ka,

400

including equations, are explained well but are not necessary to fully describe the antibiotic classes. This

401

information is not useful when determining what antibiotic to utilize, nor does it explain how dosing is

402

affected based on these values. The explanation of time-dependent, concentration-dependent and

403

antibiotics with post-antibiotic effect are explained very well; however, a comprehensive table detailing

404

what medications fall into each category is not provided. Most other textbooks include a description of

405

what an infection entails and appropriate selection of antibiotics; however, this chapter jumps directly into

406

the pharmacokinetic information.

407

Chapters 56-58 discuss various antibacterial agents with descriptions of structure activity

408

relationships, mechanism of actions, antibacterial spectrum, pharmacokinetics and indications for each

409

medication within each respective class. The organization of the chapters has an excellent flow and is

410

consistent from class to class. In chapter 56, the discussion on medications used for urinary tract

411

infections is not consistent with the other medication classes; however, the information provided is very

412

thorough and does incorporate the same information provided by the other class of medications, just in a

413

different manner. Even though there are copious amounts of information provided on each respective

414

class and each medication within the class, the format and explanations are done in a very lay method

415

allowing non-healthcare providers to understand the material as well. The inclusion of historical facts

416

about certain medication classes improves the reading quality and provides background information on

417

either the class or the antibacterial spectrum of the class. In chapter 57, the inclusion of the carbenicillin

418

class is necessary to explain the class as a whole. Other texts will exclude these medications and only

419

discuss piperacillin/tazobactam; however, including the medications not available in the United States,

420

such as ticarcillin and mezlocillin, increase the credibility of piperacillin. Most texts have difficulty

421

explaining the cephalosporin generations; however, chapter 57 does an impeccable job detailing out

422

medications in each generation and relating it back to the antibacterial spectrum. The summary table at

423

the end of chapter 57 chapter 58 is all-inclusive and does a superb job at summarizing the chapter.

424

These chapters are very thorough and useful to a variety of healthcare providers; however, there

425

are a few limitations within these three chapters which provides information that is not needed or lacks

426

information in certain areas. In chapter 56, when discussing sulfonamides, several medications are

427

referenced which are not commonly used, including one which is not approved for use in the United

428

States. This excess information makes it more difficult to find the relevant information for medications

429

more commonly utilized. One major limitation within these three chapters is the lack of tables throughout

430

the chapter to simplify indications and dosing. All indications are separated into respective paragraphs

431

which makes it more difficult to follow, providing tables after each class highlighting the indication and

432

doses would allow readers to connect all medications within the class. It is understandable that not all new

17

433

medications could be included due to the publication process being lengthy; however, four medications

434

released within the last year are not included, two of which make a huge impact in practice. Delafloxacin

435

(Baxdela®) and the combination of meropenem and vabobactam (Vabomere®) were introduced within the

436

last year, but they have not warranted major changes; however, the combination of ceftazidime and

437

avibactam (Avycaz®) and the combination of ceftolozane and tazobactam (Zerbaxa®), medications

438

introduced specifically to fight off resistant pathogens such a carbapenemase-resistant enterobacteriaceae,

439

are essential for healthcare providers to know about due to increased resistance to other medications in

440

recent years.

441

Overall, these chapters allow healthcare providers to obtain the necessary pharmaceutics

442

information needed to make decisions in patient care; however, improvements in formatting and the

443

inclusion of newer medications would benefit the text as a whole.

444

2.7 Pharmacotherapy of Neoplastic Disease

445

Chapter 65, “General Principles in the Pharmacotherapy of Cancer” is an excellent and

446

reasonably comprehensive background to cancer pharmacology. Strengths of this chapter include: (a)

447

distinguishing slower-growing cancers that have a smaller proportion of actively cycling tumor cells and

448

are thus less responsive to drugs that target the cell cycle; (b) stressing the importance of combinatorial

449

therapy, particularly combinations of molecularly targeted drugs and immunotherapy with more

450

generalized cytotoxic chemotherapy; and (c) a discussion of the various challenges of molecular testing to

451

determine those patients for whom specific targeted therapies would be most efficacious. With respect to

452

the last issue, the chapter not only discusses the issue of tumor heterogeneity but also properly cites

453

inherited genetic variation (and not just tumor-specific variation) as a factor affecting treatment response.

454

One criticism is, in the section on resistance, it is stated that the resistant cells pre-exist the treatment

455

which selects for these cells. While this no doubt occurs in the (vast) majority of cases (and the evidence

456

for this for kinase inhibitors is discussed in Chapter 67), it should be noted that resistant cells can occur

457

during treatment as a result of random mutations, unrelated to treatment, that may occur, particularly in

458

tumors exhibiting a hypermutable condition (e.g., MSI+). Also, the much more controversial issue of

18

459

adaptive mutation, which is starting to attract serious attention from a subset of researchers, could have at

460

least been mentioned in passing. For example, there has been a report of the possible role played by

461

adaptive mutation in the development of resistance to the androgen receptor antagonist bicalutamide in

462

prostate cancer cells.28

463

Chapter 66 goes into great detail about several important classes of cytotoxic drugs, mostly those

464

that block cell division and/or promote apoptosis, but also the differentiating agent all-trans retinoic acid

465

(ATRA). Alkylating agents and platinum analogs come in for a particularly extensive review, and one

466

that does justice not only to mechanisms of action and therapeutic efficacy, but also the (often serious)

467

side effects of these agents. The chapter also makes an important distinction between bifunctional agents

468

and monofunctional methylating agents, which is helpful.

469

Chapter 67, “Pathway-Targeted Therapies: Monoclonal Antibodies, Protein Kinases Inhibitors,

470

and Various Small Molecules” delves into a detailed examination of pathway-targeted therapies, centered

471

on small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies, two approaches that are contrasted with respect

472

to range of action and to their side effects (the small molecules tend to have both a greater range of

473

desirable activities as well as negative side effects). Similar to the examination of cytotoxic therapies in

474

the preceding chapter and to the more general introduction of chapter 65, attention is paid to issues of

475

mechanism of action, matching specific therapy to the appropriate type of cancer including genetic

476

variation of the cancer, preexisting inherited genetic variation of the patient that affects response, side

477

effects, and development of resistance. Also, combinatorial therapy is touched upon, an approach

478

particularly useful with the monoclonal antibodies. The sections on angiogenesis inhibitors and

479

immunotherapy (particularly the immune checkpoint inhibitors) was quite good, and this reviewer

480

positively notes the discussion of combinatorial immune checkpoint therapy targeting both cytotoxic T

481

lymphocyte–associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death-1 (PD-1). There was some discussion

482

about how to overcome resistance; for example, resistance to the MEK inhibitor trametinib can be

483

overcome by combinatorial therapy with the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib, and there is also discussion

484

about dealing with imatinib resistance. This is all significant; if anything, more on this topic can be

485

included; the same can be said about ameliorating side effects of these agents. There was some decent

486

discussion on this latter topic; particularly useful was the note about colony stimulating factors used to

487

deal with hematopoietic toxicity of many anti-cancer therapies. Certainly, an expanded analysis of such

488

topics is always welcomed. The section on histone deacetylase inhibitors was adequate, but there could

489

have been a discussion about butyrate, a fermentation product of dietary fiber, which is a histone

490

deacetylase inhibitor and one that may significantly mediate the anti-cancer properties of dietary fiber for

491

the colon. These topics could have been broached, which would have also allowed for a discussion of

492

how naturally occurring agents in food may exert preventive action against cancer. Although the book is

493

focusing on pharmacological therapy, the overlap between pharmacology and “medicinal food,” as well

494

as that between prevention and treatment, could have been productively addressed for the sake of

495

completeness. Chemoprevention is a legitimate topic in the field of cancer, both with respect to natural

496

products as well as, perhaps, other pharmacological agents. One issue that could have been included as

497

additional detailed discussion is the approach of inducing apoptosis through hyper-activation (rather than

498

inhibition) of signaling pathways the cancer cell is “addicted to.” There also could have been some

499

discussion of cutting-edge small molecules in clinical trial that target signaling pathways, such as ICG-

500

001-like compounds that inhibit CBP-mediated Wnt signaling. Further, by connecting issues such as

501

targeting signaling pathways, hyperactivating signaling pathways, and molecularly targeted drugs, one

502

could cite the finding that some histone deacetylase inhibitors can hyperactivate Wnt signaling to induced

503

apoptosis of colorectal cancer cells in culture, pointing to a possible novel therapeutic approach. That

504

underscores one weakness of these chapters: while they tend to give an excellent overview of existing

505

therapies, there is not much about possible novel future approaches.

506

Chapter 68 offers sound coverage on the role of hormone modulation for cancer therapeutics.

507

Two main approaches were addressed. First, there was discussion about glucocorticoids, which can not

508

only be used for anti-cancer treatment, but also to ameliorate side effects from other forms of cancer

509

therapy. Second, hormone-based therapy for breast and prostate cancer was addressed. Interestingly,

510

while anti-estrogen therapy is now important in breast cancer treatment, in the past, high doses of

20

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19007385; this version posted September 29, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

511

estrogen were used for certain breast cancers to induce apoptosis. The chapter notes that it is necessary to

512

address the physiological type of breast cancer before commencing therapy, as some forms of the disease

513

are hormone-therapy resistant. The chapter also goes into detail about anti-androgen therapy for prostate

514

cancer, and this is well done, although analysis of quality-of-life issues would have strengthened the

515

discussion of pharmacology-based treatment options for this disease.

516

2.8 Special systems pharmacology

517

The dermatological and ocular pharmacology chapters have been greatly expanded compared to

518

the 12th edition of GGPBT. Five new agents (bentoquatam, coal tar, anthralin, brimonidine, and

519

propranolol) were added to the “miscellaneous agents” section and one agent was removed (podophyllin)

520

in the dermatological chapter compared to last edition. Both chapters have high quality colorful figures of

521

pathways and tables with details such as structural class and efficacy for each agent. Additionally, there is

522

a drug summary table at the end of the chapter with therapeutic uses, clinical pharmacology, and tips for

523

each agent to compliment the text.

524

The ocular chapter provides excellent explanation of the medications’ mechanisms of action and

525

describes which agent is preferred or which agent provides fewer side effects compared to an agent within

526

the same class. For example, brimonidine is less likely to cause ocular allergy and for that reason, it is

527

more commonly used. Although this information is presented throughout the chapter, it is not accessible

528

in one place. An algorithm highlighting what is first-line and second-line treatment for glaucoma in the

529

ocular chapter would have been beneficial to the reader.
When compared to Koda Kimble 10th edition, 29 the dermatological and ocular chapters in GGPBT

530
531

lack cases. It would have been helpful to have included case questions within the chapter, so the reader

532

can easily see how the pharmacological information is applicable to patients in practice. In comparison to

533

KatBCP,

534

headlines are not as clearly defined and are presented in a less organized format. Within the sunscreen

535

portion in the dermatological chapter, it might have been desirable to have more details about each agent.

536

The chapters use only the generic name of medications. Since pharmacy students are expected to know

23

DISCUSSION

542

The quantitative and qualitative evaluation provided here is a substantial extension of prior

543

reports.1-8,12 Evaluating a large (currently > 1,440 pages) textbook1-7 in just a few paragraphs, as is

544

common, loses some nuance and may do a disservice to the breadth of coverage for an interdisciplinary

545

and rapidly changing field. Overall, the editors and authors of GGPBT should be recognized for assuming

546

such a large task as each new edition is a substantial and commendable achievement.

547

Approximately four out of every five GGPBT authors were male. Unfortunately, this finding is

548

concurrent with a larger body of evidence.9, 10 For example, a widely used internal medicine textbook had

549

slightly fewer (18.6%) female authors.12 The gender gap in GGPBT authorship showed some

550

improvements relative to the 12th edition where eight out of nine contributors were male.8 At this rate,

551

GGPBT

552

that editors should recruit authors to achieve an arbitrary numerical representation. However, if the

553

expertise exists, as is evident in some pharmacotherapy textbooks,8,12 and the pool of authors

554

insufficiently reflects this diversity, then the policy that GGPBT selects authors would merit

555

reconsideration.

may achieve gender parity when the sixteenth edition is published in 2039. We are not suggesting

556

Citations in GGPBT were significantly less recent than those found in both KatBCP and DiPPAPA.

557

Further, references were of similar age in KatBCP. The difference between sections with the most recent

558

and oldest citations was only 2.7 years versus over twice as large for DiPPAPA (6.5) and GGBCP (6.7).

559

Agents used for gastrointestinal disorders were most recent in GGPBT and DiPPAPA while drugs acting on

560

the nervous system were the most dated in GGPBT and KatBCP. Possibly, the neuropharmacology sections

561

may change with further development of novel agents for Alzheimer’s29 and neuroendocrine

562

pharmacotherapies for obesity.30

563

There is also substantial room for improvement in conflicts of interest transparency in GGPBT.

564

With rare exceptions21, biomedical textbooks do not currently report on CoIs. Even in DipPAPA, which

565

discloses self-reported CoIs, four of the top ten highest compensated authors appeared to under-report

566

their disclosures which could be due to a narrow reporting time frame, a narrow definition of “relevant”

567

CoIs, or failing to provide the information to the editors. Editors may need to formalize responses to

568

inaccurate disclosure including reductions to the honorarium or exclusion from future editions. Primary

569

sources often employ the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) 31 form for

570

disclosure of potential CoIs where authors are instructed to be inclusive. More specifically, the

571

instructions specify “You should disclose interactions with ANY entity that could be considered broadly

572

relevant to the work. For example, if an article is about testing an epidermal growth factor receptor

573

(EGFR) antagonist in lung cancer, one should report all associations with entities pursuing diagnostic or

574

therapeutic strategies in cancer in general”. On the other hand, the ICMJE instructions might need to be

575

adjusted to incorporate the extended time-frame of textbooks where the same authors commonly

576

contribute to multiple editions over an extended period. Verification of self-reported disclosures with

577

ProPublica’s Dollars for Docs (PPDD) and Medicaid Service’s Open Payments (CMSOP) would be a trivial

578

task for publishing staff. Complete and accurate CoI disclosures will contribute to maintaining the highest

579

degree of trust that content is consistent with the principles of evidence based medicine20 in subsequent

580

editions.

581

Narrative evaluations by content experts revealed several strengths but also some potential for

582

improvement. The neuropharmacology section missed an opportunity to at least begin to acquaint future

583

health care providers that terms in wide-spread use like “mood stabilizers”, “antipsychotics” and

584

“stimulants” are not informative and could be replaced by neuroscience-based nomenclature.24 There is

585

also a need for more uniform avoidance of stigmatizing language.27 In general, the chapters on neoplasia

586

are sound, and give a reasonably comprehensive overview on both traditional pharmacological therapies

587

as well as some of the newer, more cutting-edge approaches. There are some weaknesses, however. A

588

better understanding of the basic molecular biology would be helpful; in particular, this would strengthen

589

discussion about the development of resistance to theory, as well as how signaling pathways can be

590

modulated for therapeutic effect. Other areas of improvement would be an increased attention to

591

chemoprevention, novel future approaches, and quality of life issues concerning side effects of treatment.

592

More broadly, identification of which agents are not available in the United States at the time of

593

publication would benefit multiple sections.

594

Some caveats and limitations are noteworthy. First, the sex differences identified are consistent

595

with a broader pattern in academic medicine.8-10, 12 Future research should determine whether ethnic

596

minorities are similarly under-represented as biomedical textbook authors. Second, the CoI databases do

597

not report on non-financial CoIs or the financial relationships of non-physicians (i.e. half of GGPBT

598

authors). Therefore, the three million received by authors from pharmaceutical companies is likely an

599

underestimate. The presence of potential CoI, although appreciable, does not necessarily mean that

600

content was impacted in any way. Third, the textbook citation differences in Figure 1A would be less

601

pronounced if GGPBT were published slightly (one year) earlier. Therefore, the findings within each

602

textbook (Figures 1B, 1C, 1D) may be more meaningful. On the other-hand, while the findings in Figure

603

1A were hypothesized a priori, the results in Figure 1B-D were not and may be susceptible to Type I

604

errors. Fourth, although the narrative reviewers came from diverse fields and had substantial experience

605

as educators, health care providers, and biomedical scientists, collectively, we are a far less distinguished

606

group than the esteemed authors of GGPBT. There is some subjectivity underlying expert opinion and it is

607

likely that others may have identified somewhat different strengths and limitations in GGPBT content.

608
609

CONCLUSION

610

This report identifies many strengths of the 13th edition of GGPBT but also some areas for improvement

611

including greater diversity of authors, heightened transparency of conflict of interest disclosures, and

612

improved recency of citations in select areas.

#1:

The new edition of Goodman and Gilman’s Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (GGPBT) seeks to explain the

concepts of pharmacology beginning with the basics and continuing through some of the practical applications used in
many hospitals today. The organization of the text is superb and allows for easy comprehension. After the basics are
covered, the physiological systems and their drug targets are neatly categorized so as to help the reader understand the
interactions between the biological system, the underlying disease, and appropriate medication. After each of the tissue or
system specific maladies are covered, the text delves into more broad illnesses and their treatments in the infectious
disease and chemotherapy sections.
The writing in the text is clear and easy to understand. Each disease is well defined, and the text makes good use
of diagrams and figures to explain the mechanisms behind the illness. After elucidating the cause of the problem, the text
explains the mechanisms behind each potential treatment, and clearly summarizes their advantages and risks in a table.
Any unusual or dangerous interactions of a drug are sufficiently explained, and the precautions to using such a medication
are always described.

#2

The 13th edition of Goodman and Gilman’s Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics (GGPBT) made the learning

and interpretation of pharmacology easier for the reader. The way the content is organized, the reader is better able to pick
out important ideas from the support given on each topic. This provides a good outline for studying the material required
by any specific course using this textbook.
The order of the text overall offers a lot of information at the beginning, and towards the end there are
applications of the reader’s knowledge to the treatment of specific diseases and uses for some of the drugs. The text also
provides an explanation for physiological processes before explaining the drugs that affect them, which allows the reader
to have a better understanding of the significance and action of the drug. Each chapter is formulated so that the material is
interesting, and difficult subjects are explained well so that the reader is not lost in the details. There is sufficient support
given for the content, so the reader can apply what they are learning to other outside sources and ideas. Clear and legible
figures and tables are placed throughout the text in order for the reader to visualize the content in a different form.
Explaining the image well within the text provides a good flow that allows the student to understand the topic better. The
