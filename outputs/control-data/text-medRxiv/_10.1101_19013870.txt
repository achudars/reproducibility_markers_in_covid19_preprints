ABSTRACT

50

Defective OprD porins contribute to carbapenem resistance and may be important in

51

Pseudomonas aeruginosa adaptation to cystic fibrosis airways. It is unclear whether oprD

52

mutations are fixed in populations of shared strains that are transmitted between patients or

53

whether novel variants arise during infection. We investigated oprD sequences and

54

antimicrobial resistance of two common Australian shared strains, constructed P. aeruginosa

55

mutants with the most common oprD allelic variants and compared characteristics between

56

patients with or without evidence of infection with strains harbouring these variants. Our data

57

show that three independently acquired nonsense mutations arising from a 1-base pair

58

substitution are fixed in strain sub-lineages. These nonsense mutations are likely to contribute

59

to reduced carbapenem susceptibility in the sub-lineages without compromising in vitro

60

fitness. Not only was lung function worse among patients infected with strains harbouring the

61

nonsense mutations than those without, but they also had an increased hazard rate of lung

62

transplantation/death. Our findings further highlight that understanding adaptive changes may

63

help to distinguish patients with greater adverse outcomes despite infection with the same

64

strain.

INTRODUCTION

70

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-shortening autosomal recessive disease resulting in progressive

71

lung damage (Elborn, Ramsey et al., 2016). Lower airway infection with Pseudomonas

72

aeruginosa is common, increases with age and, when chronic infection is established, is

73

associated with increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) (Murray, Egan et al., 2007).

74

Although diverse P. aeruginosa genotypes are ubiquitous in the natural environment, some

75

people with CF are infected with clonally-related strains (“shared stains”), which often

76

display AMR to multiple drugs (Parkins, Somayaji et al., 2018). Shared strains have been

77

identified nationally in Australia with three genotypes prominent: AUST-01, AUST-02 and

78

AUST-06 (the latter two are particularly common in the state of Queensland, Australia )

79

(Kidd, Ramsay et al., 2013).

80

81

Adaptation of P. aeruginosa to survive and persist in the CF lower airway microenvironment

82

occurs in the setting of long-term antibiotic selective pressure with the occurrence of

83

substantial intra-strain phenotypical and genotypical population diversity. Genome

84

sequencing studies have demonstrated that certain loci are more prone to mutation than others

85

(e.g. mexZ, gyrA) (Dettman, Rodrigue et al., 2013, Diaz Caballero, Clark et al., 2015, Marvig,

86

Dolce et al., 2015a, Marvig, Johansen et al., 2013, Marvig, Sommer et al., 2015b, Mowat,

87

Paterson et al., 2011, Smith, Buckley et al., 2006, Williams, Evans et al., 2015). However,

88

there is limited information on whether mutations in AMR-related loci are fixed within

89

independent shared strain genotypes or whether novel variants are generally observed in

90

individual patient isolates, suggesting parallel evolution. Identifying differences in adaptive

91

changes in P. aeruginosa may help to predict people with CF at the greatest risk of lung

function deterioration (Hoffman, Kulasekara et al., 2009, Li, Kosorok et al., 2005, Mayer-

93

Hamblett, Rosenfeld et al., 2014, Tai, Bell et al., 2015a).

94

We have performed a detailed analysis of oprD encoding an outer membrane porin, OprD

95

(Porin D or Protein D2 [(Winsor, Griffiths et al., 2016)]), and AMR in a longitudinal

96

collection of shared strains from patients with CF. Polymorphisms in oprD have been

97

detected frequently within, and between, strains in many studies indicating their potential

98

importance in adaptation of P. aeruginosa to the CF airways (Greipel, Fischer et al., 2016,

99

Kos, Deraspe et al., 2015, Marvig et al., 2013, Marvig et al., 2015b, Wee, Tai et al., 2018).

100

OprD facilitates diffusion of substrates, such as carbapenems and basic amino acids, across

101

cell membranes. It is well recognised that decreased expression or mutational inactivation of

102

oprD is an important AMR mechanism (Courtois, Caspar et al., 2018, Jaillard, van Belkum et

103

al., 2017, Kos et al., 2015, Strateva & Yordanov, 2009). It has been shown that virulence is

104

enhanced in P. aeruginosa lacking OprD (Skurnik, Roux et al., 2013), demonstrating that

105

mutations at this locus could potentially have consequences for in vivo pathogenicity.

106

107

In this study we hypothesised that commonly encountered shared P. aeruginosa strains

108

derived from patients with CF harbour loss-of-function oprD mutations that: (1) contribute to

109

reduced susceptibility to carbapenems, and (2) could be used as genetic markers to identify a

110

subset of patients at higher risk of an adverse clinical course.

RESULTS

112

In silico analysis of oprD sequences

113

The phylogenetic relationship of oprD variants is shown in Fig 1A. The wild-type variant of

114

AUST-02 and AUST-06 (1326-bp) is denoted as the variant that is closest to the base of each

115

oprD clade. These are highly conserved with only 2 nucleotide differences between the

116

lineages at nucleotide positions 807 (T or C) and 1065 (C or G); their protein sequences are

117

identical (441 amino acids). Fourteen of 114 (12%) isolates had the denoted wild-type

118

variant.

119
120

Conspicuous loss-of-function mutations in oprD caused by a 1-bp substitution or a 1-bp

121

insertion or deletion (indel) occurred multiple times in the strain collection. Notably, three

122

independent nonsense mutations caused by a 1-bp substitution were identified in 79/114

123

(69%) isolates from 32/50 (64%) patients; two mutations were exclusive to the AUST-02

124

genotype (oprD c.526G>T or oprD c.748C>T) and one exclusive to AUST-06 (oprD

125

c.956C>A). These SNPs were predicted to result in a truncated protein sequence in silico,

126

with oprD c.526G>T (p.E176X), c.748C>T (p.Q250X), and c.956C>A (p.S319X) leading to

127

truncation at amino acids 175, 249 and 318, respectively. All AUST-02 isolates carrying the

128

oprD c.526G>T (p.E176X) variant belong to the M3L7 sub-type, described previously

129

(Sherrard, Tai et al., 2017, Tai et al., 2015a, Wee et al., 2018).

130
131

Seven independent 1-bp indels resulting in a shift in the reading frame were also identified in

132

a smaller proportion of isolates (n=20/114; 18%) from 10/50 (20%) participants; each of

133

these belong to the AUST-06 genotype. Six indels were predicted in silico to result in a

134

truncated protein sequence, with the remaining indel extending the protein length by 31

135

amino acids to 472 amino acids.

136
137

Only two isolates had acquired additional missense mutations AUS925 (oprD

138

c.464_465TG>AA, p.L155Q) and AUS899 (oprD c.1174A>C, p.N392H), which were each

139

predicted computationally to affect protein function (Choi, Sims et al., 2012). One isolate

140

(AUS901) had an additional synonymous mutation (oprD c.1206T>G). Finally, the oprD

141

variant of one AUST-02 isolate (AUS426) was disrupted by an insertion sequence (IS) of the

142

IS3 family that is 100% identical to that found in a sequenced plasmid (GenBank:

143

JX469825.1).

144
145

Participants with >1 isolate sequenced, were generally infected with a strain that had an

146

identical oprD variant (n=14/18; 78%). However, four participants (Patient-11, Patient-17,

147

Patient-24 and Patient-37), had multiple oprD variants among their sequenced isolates (Fig

148

1). Based on the core genome phylogeny of AUST-02 and AUST-06 (Fig 1B), nearly all

149

oprD variants emerge from monophyletic clades, which suggests that lineages with specific

150

oprD variants pre-existed in the population before spreading between patients. However, we

151

also observed in isolates from Patient-11 and Patient-37, a scenario where multiple oprD

152

variants had arisen independently from the same lineage (Fig 1B).

153
154

AMR of clinical isolates

155

There were no statistical differences in MICs of the six anti-pseudomonal antimicrobials

156

tested between the AUST-02 (n=63) and AUST-06 (n=51) genotypes (Fig S1A).

157
158

Given the prevalence of isolates with a nonsense mutation arising from a 1-bp substitution

159

(‘target SNPs’; n=79), we decided to focus on characterising their AMR patterns compared to

160

isolates with other (‘indel’) oprD mutations (n=21; frameshift caused by 1-bp indel or

161

disruption by IS) or the denoted wild-type variant (n=14). MIC comparisons are shown in Fig

162

S1B. Statistically significant differences in MICs were apparent for all antimicrobials except

163

colistin to which 99% of isolates were susceptible (Table I). Isolates with a variant containing

164

a target SNP (100%) or an indel (95%) were highly resistant to imipenem (MIC50: >32 mg/L)

165

whereas only one isolate with the wild-type variant (MIC50: 1.5 mg/L) was resistant (Table I).

166

Those with a target SNP also demonstrated greater resistance and had statistically higher

167

MICs for meropenem (all p<0.001), ceftazidime (p=0.04 or p<0.001) and ticarcillin-

168

clavulanic acid (all p<0.001) relative to isolates with other variants (Table I). Isolates with a

169

target SNP had higher MICs for tobramycin (p=0.006) compared to isolates with an indel.

170
171

Finally, to indicate if clinical isolates with target SNPs (oprD c.526G>T, p.E176X; oprD

172

c.748C>T, p.Q250X; oprD c.956C>A, p.S319X) had similar AMR profiles, their MICs were

173

compared. Although MICs did not differ for the carbapenems, they varied statistically for the

174

remaining four antimicrobials tested (Fig S1C).

175
176

Allelic replacement of oprD in PAO1

177

Next, we investigated the specific contribution that each target SNP had on carbapenem

178

resistance profiles using PAO1, which is susceptible to imipenem (MIC 1 mg/L) and

179

meropenem (MIC 0.38 mg/L).

180
181

Introduction of the observed 1-bp substitutions into oprD of PAO1 via allelic replacement led

182

to imipenem resistance for all isogenic mutants (PAO1-OprDE176X, 32 mg/L; PAO1-

183

OprDQ250X, 24 mg/L; PAO1-OprDS319X, 32 mg/L) and increased the meropenem MIC by ~2-3

184

doubling dilutions (PAO1-OprDE176X, 3 mg/L; PAO1-OprDQ250X, 2 mg/L; PAO1-OprDS319X,

185

1.5 mg/L).

186

The meropenem MICs are much lower than the MICs seen in the clinical isolates (MIC50:

187

>32 mg/L). All complemented mutants had MICs at wild-type PAO1 levels (Table II).

188

Furthermore, there were no apparent differences in the susceptibility of each isogenic mutant

189

to ceftazidime, ticarcillin-clavulanate, tobramycin and colistin compared to the wild-type

190

strain (Table II).

191
192

It was predicted in silico that each of the target SNPs would lead to a truncated protein of

193

between 175 and 318 amino acids. A global data-dependent liquid chromatography-mass

194

spectrometry analysis found no evidence of OprD protein in the PAO1-OprDE176X, PAO1-

195

OprDQ250X, and PAO1-OprDS319X isogenic mutants. In contrast, peptides spanning both N-

196

and C-terminal regions of the OprD protein were detected in PAO1 and all of the

197

complemented mutants. Targeted mass spectrometry using parallel reaction monitoring

198

(PRM) analysis confirmed these results using tryptic peptides that were unique to OprD when

199

compared to the background proteome of PAO1. Finally, in vitro growth was not affected by

200

the introduction of the target oprD SNPs into the chromosome of PAO1 (Fig S2).

201

Clinical course

202

Variant-specific PCR indicated that 434/890 (49%) isolates from 149 participants had one of

203

the target SNPs in oprD (Fig 2).

204
205

Overall, 83/149 (56%) participants were infected with ≥1 isolate carrying a target SNP in

206

oprD (Fig 2); whereas the remaining participants (control subjects) had infection with

207

isolates with other oprD variants. Specifically, 101/569 (18%; 22 participants) and 154/569

208

(27%; 27 participants) AUST-02 isolates tested positive for the oprD c.526G>T (p.E176X)

209

and oprD c.748C>T (p.Q250X) variants, respectively. All AUST-02 isolates positive for the

210

oprD c.526G>T (p.E176X) variant were confirmed as belonging to the M3L7 sub-type by

211

PCR. More than half (n=179/321, 56%; 41 participants) of AUST-06 isolates tested positive

212

for the oprD c.956C>A (p.S319X) variant. Seven (5%) participants with >1 isolate had

213

multiple target variants detected in concurrent or longitudinal isolates.

214
215

Cases (n=82, one case lacked clinical data and was excluded from the analysis) and control

216

(n=66) subjects were similar with respect to age, sex, CFTR function, chronic/type of shared

217

strain infection status and co-morbidities. The odds of being a case was reduced with higher

218

lung function (OR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.96-0.99; p<0.001) and increased with a greater number of

219

hospital days (OR, 1.01, 95% CI, 1.00-1.03; p=0.010). Although not statistically significant,

220

the odds of being a case was reduced with increasing BMI (OR, 0.92, 95% CI, 0.83-1.02;

221

p=0.11). Amongst long-term treatments prescribed, inhaled colistin significantly increased

222

the odds of being a case (OR, 2.48, 95% CI, 1.22-5.04; p=0.010) compared to non-inhalation

223

as did tobramycin although it was not significant (OR, 2.13, 95% CI, 0.84-5.43; p=0.11)

224

(Table III). After controlling for all these factors in a multivariable logistic regression, only

225

lung function remained statistically significant.

226
227

Furthermore, 45/148 (30%; one participant lacked clinical data and was excluded from the

228

analysis) participants were deceased (n=15) or had received a lung transplant (n=30) by the

229

censor date (Table SI). The type of shared strain infection was not found to be predictive of

230

transplant or death (p=0.77). However, being a case had a higher risk of transplant or death

231

(HR, 2.44; 95% CI, 1.27-4.68) compared to being a control subject.

232
233

DISCUSSION

234

The emergence of AMR in bacterial pathogens is a foremost concern for clinical management

235

of people with CF, especially as longevity is increasing, and complex antimicrobial treatment

236

regimens are a mainstay of routine care (Waters, Kidd et al., 2019). This study focused on

237

carbapenems, which are fundamental antimicrobials used intravenously to treat pulmonary

238

exacerbations but are often reserved for those with advanced disease or where there is a

239

suboptimal clinical response to other ß-lactam antibiotics. Therefore, they are a critical class

240

of antimicrobials to manage the most vulnerable patients. Nevertheless, reduced

241

susceptibility of P. aeruginosa to carbapenems is reported, including in our Queensland CF

242

population (Smith, Ramsay et al., 2016, Tai, Kidd et al., 2015b); but the underlying resistance

243

mechanisms and the potential clinical implications of their identification are less clear.

244
245

In our initial work, we performed a targeted analysis of the oprD locus of two major

246

Australian shared strains. We found that both strains frequently carry oprD variants,

247

supporting previous studies that identified this gene as a common target for mutation during

248

persistent infection of the CF airways (Greipel et al., 2016, Marvig et al., 2015b). The oprD

249

variants identified were not shared by AUST-02 and AUST-06, providing no current

250

evidence of DNA transfer of a variant between the genotypes, even though some patients

251

may be concurrently infected with both strains (Tai, Sherrard et al., 2017). Furthermore,

252

rather than identifying many novel oprD variants that were generally exclusive to individual

253

patient isolates, we repeatedly identified three specific variants in isolates from multiple

254

patients, which were characteristic of monophyletic strain sub-lineages (Fig 1B). Each variant

255

was truncated due to a nonsense mutation caused by a SNP. We hypothesise that these SNPs

256

became fixed in the sub-lineages following their divergence from all other AUST-02/AUST-

257

06 strains and these sub-lineages were subsequently disseminated between patients, possibly

258

from patient socialisation or via the aerosol mode of transmission (Knibbs, Johnson et al.,

259

2014, Ojeniyi, Frederiksen et al., 2000). This is supported by finding that all AUST-02

260

isolates positive by PCR for the oprD c.526G>T (p.E176X) variant were confirmed as

261

belonging to the recently characterised AUST-02 sub-lineage, M3L7, and provides further

262

evidence that this mutation is exclusive to the lineage (Wee et al., 2018). In addition,

263

introduction of the various SNPs of interest into oprD of PAO1 had no impact on in vitro

264

growth suggesting that these mutations may be acquired without a cost to fitness. Acquiring

265

mutations without a fitness cost may further substantiate the likelihood of clinical strains

266

carrying these oprD variants successfully spreading and establishing new infections in the CF

267

patient population (MacLean & San Millan, 2019).

268
269

Interestingly, we also observed two cases where a single AUST-06 lineage acquired two or

270

three different oprD variants within a patient (Fig 1B). It is unclear whether these variants

271

were already present in the AUST-06 population before the patient was infected or whether

272

each variant arose independently during the course of infection.

273
274

It is reported that reduced expression or inactivation of OprD constitutes a major resistance

275

mechanism to carbapenems (Courtois et al., 2018, Li, Luo et al., 2012, Llanes, Pourcel et al.,

276

2013) and in keeping with this, our analysis revealed that 99% of imipenem-resistant isolates

277

harboured oprD with either a nonsense or indel mutation or on one occasion, disruption by an

278

insertion sequence (MIC50: >32mg/L). Conversely, a full-length coding sequence was

279

associated with much lower MICs (MIC50: 1.5mg/L). One clear discrepancy was a single

280

isolate (AUS396) carrying a 1-bp insertion in oprD between nucleotides at positions 1199

281

and 1200, which was susceptible to imipenem (MIC: 2mg/L). This frameshift mutation was

282

predicted to extend the length of the protein and indeed an earlier study found that isolates

283

carrying additional amino acids at the C-terminus of OprD remained susceptible to

284

carbapenems (Ocampo-Sosa, Cabot et al., 2012). However, three other isolates (AUS886,

285

AUS916, AUS918) carrying the same 1-bp insertion as AUS396 showed resistance to

286

imipenem (MICs: >32mg/L). This highlights the complexity of deciphering the development

287

of AMR and the need for studies characterising the impact of individual and combinations of

288

chromosomally acquired mutations.

289
290

The impact of the various mutations on porin integrity is influenced by their position in the

291

protein sequence (Epp, Kohler et al., 2001, Huang, Jeanteur et al., 1995, Ocampo-Sosa et al.,

292

2012). We determined the effect of the three most common oprD SNPs in our strain

293

collection using site-directed mutagenesis in the reference strain, PAO1. Our results showed

294

imipenem resistance and an apparent loss of the porin for all three truncations (p.E176X,

295

p.Q250X, p.S319X). Although 97% of clinical isolates with the target SNPs also had a

296

meropenem MIC >32mg/L, we found that in our isogenic mutants the target SNPs increased

297

the meropenem MIC only by several fold to a maximum of 3 mg/L. It is recognised that

298

mutations in oprD alone do not cause meropenem resistance (Strateva & Yordanov, 2009).

299

The target oprD variants are likely to contribute to reduced susceptibility to meropenem in

300

the clinical isolates and clinical resistance may be a polygenic trait. More genetically diverse

301

collections of isolates with meropenem resistance are needed to identify the genes that are

302

significantly associated with this phenotype. Additionally, the SNPs did not impact the MICs

303

of other β-lactam antibiotics, tobramycin or colistin confirming that these mutations

304

specifically affect the activity of carbapenem antibiotics.

305
306

Based on our prior genome sequencing studies of the M3L7 sub-lineage (Sherrard et al.,

307

2017, Wee et al., 2018), it is likely that the individual clinical isolates included in the current

308

study harbor a multitude of concurrent mutational mechanisms to achieve the high-level

309

resistance observed to carbapenems and the other antimicrobials studied. Carbapenem

310

resistance can arise from the production of antibiotic-inactivating carbapenemases; but recent

311

studies failed to detect acquired carbapenemase encoding genes in CF P. aeruginosa isolates

312

suggesting that, to date, this mechanism is uncommon in CF (Chalhoub, Saenz et al., 2016,

313

Courtois et al., 2018, Mustafa, Chalhoub et al., 2016, Tai et al., 2015b). Upregulation of

314

multi-drug efflux pumps and de-repression of the cephalosporinase, AmpC, harbouring

315

spectrum-extending mutations may also contribute to increased MICs (Rodriguez-Martinez,

316

Poirel et al., 2009, Strateva & Yordanov, 2009). We previously identified mutations in

317

various efflux pump regulators (e.g. mexZ, nalC, nalD) and pump proteins (e.g. mexX, mexY)

318

and ampC which might also contribute to carbapenem resistance in M3L7 (Sherrard et al.,

319

2017). It was proposed that inactivation of OprD could be the primary resistance mechanism

320

induced by carbapenem selective pressure with further mechanisms acquired thereafter (Li et

321

al., 2012).

322
323

The AUST-02 and AUST-06 genotypes, have been associated with increased treatment

have also identified that adaptive mutations in specific loci, including in mucA or related

326

genes that lead to mucoidy or loss-of-function mutations in the transcriptional regulator of

327

quorum sensing lasR were associated with accelerated decline in lung function or disease

328

progression (Hoffman et al., 2009, Li et al., 2005). In our current work, we identified a subset

329

of people (>50%) infected with AUST-02/AUST-06 with poorer clinical outcomes based on

330

detection of specific oprD variants. This finding extends our previous work that identified a

331

small group of adults infected with M3L7 who had a greater 3-year risk of lung

332

transplantation/death (Tai et al., 2015a) and further highlights the heterogenous clinical

333

course of people despite infection with clonally-related strains. When we investigated the

334

characteristics of people who had acquired strains carrying the target oprD SNPs in our

335

multivariable model, lower forced expiratory volume in one-second %predicted was

336

potentially important. As we are unable to precisely determine when each person first became

337

infected with these strains, it is unknown whether they contribute to lung function decline or

that is characteristic of the CF lungs (Pezzulo, Tang et al., 2012).

353
354

Limitations of this study include the small number of isolates that were available per person,

355

especially as infection with multiple strain types and co-existence of divergent strain sub-

356

lineages is recognised (Diaz Caballero et al., 2015, Tai et al., 2017, Williams et al., 2015).

357

Therefore, we may have underestimated the proportion of people infected with strains

358

carrying the target variants. In addition, the variant-specific PCRs were specific to the SNPs

359

of interest and therefore, only have a potential prognostic value to patient populations where

360

AUST-02 and AUST-06 genotypes have been identified. Furthermore, it is likely that the

361

proportion of isolates, which were negative for the target SNPs, will harbour other loss-of-

362

function oprD mutations. If these mutations have similar features to the target SNPs is

363

unclear. It is also unknown if the oprD SNPs identified have a therapeutic value in predicting

response to pulmonary exacerbation treatment regimens containing carbapenems. Currently,

in vitro AMR and in vivo response to treatment are not well correlated in chronic P.

367

the oprD variant carrying a nonsense mutation in AUST-02 or AUST-06 clinical isolates with

that of the wild-type variant, as the clinical isolates were insensitive to SacB-mediated

CONCLUSIONS

372

We found that nucleotide substitutions and indels were commonly encountered in the oprD

gene of two prevalent shared strains in an Australian CF population and included three

374

independently acquired nonsense mutations fixed in different sub-lineages. These nonsense

375

mutations could largely explain imipenem resistance amongst the corresponding CF isolates

MATERIALS AND METHODS

382

Clinical isolates

383

To account for potential diversity in AMR in vitro and oprD sequences, two shared strains,

384

AUST-02 and AUST-06, were selected for this study. All isolates were obtained by prior

385

surveillance studies between 2001-2014 (Kidd et al., 2013, O'Carroll, Syrmis et al., 2004,

386

Ramsay, Bell et al., 2016, Sherrard et al., 2017) from single colony sputum cultures and were

387

identified as AUST-02 or AUST-06 via ERIC-PCR and/or iPLEX20SNP genotyping (Kidd et

388

al., 2013, Kidd, Ramsay et al., 2015, O'Carroll et al., 2004, Ramsay et al., 2016, Sherrard et

al., 2017, Syrmis, Kidd et al., 2014). Isolates are held in the QIMR Berghofer Pseudomonas

Genomic DNA from 63 AUST-02 isolates (including 37 isolates of the AUST-02 strain sub-

402

(10 aged <18-years) attending three CF centres in Brisbane (see Table SII for further details).

Due to the absence of a closely related complete reference genome (less than 20,000 single

414

nucleotide polymorphisms [SNPs]) to AUST-02 and AUST-06 lineages, we first used Parsnp

415

to align the AUST-02 and AUST-06 isolates to PAO1 to determine the approximate position

416

of the root of each lineage (Treangen, Ondov et al., 2014). A multiple genome alignment was

417

then calculated with only genomes from each shared strain. Alignments were filtered for

418

recombination using Gubbins (v2.3.1) and Maximum-Likelihood phylogenies were

419

constructed with IQTREE (v1.6.6) with 1000 bootstrap replicates (Croucher, Page et al.,

422

Identification of oprD variants

423

Gene sequences of oprD from the 63 AUST-02 and 51 AUST-06 isolates were then obtained

424

from the whole genome sequences. Sequence similarity to oprD from PAO1 (PA0958; 1332-

425

base pairs [bp]) was determined using blastn requiring ≥50% of the query sequence to be

426

present. The AUST-02 and AUST-06 oprD variants were then aligned using TranslatorX and

427

Mafft (Abascal, Zardoya et al., 2010, Katoh & Standley, 2013). Relationships between the

428

different oprD variants were visualised using the Neighbour-Joining algorithm implemented

429

in Jalview (v2.10.4b1) (Waterhouse, Procter et al., 2009) .

Etest® susceptibility testing

431

Isolates were inoculated onto Mueller-Hinton Agar and minimum inhibitory concentrations

432

(MICs) were obtained by Etest® (BioMérieux) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

433

Isolates were categorised as susceptible, intermediate or resistant (CLSI, 2018). The

described by Muhl and Filloux (Muhl & Filloux, 2014). The disc diffusion method (Thermo

456

Fisher Scientific) was employed to detect resistance to imipenem as a screen for potential

457

isogenic mutants. The presence of the SNPs in the genome of putative PAO1 mutants was

458

confirmed by PCR and DNA sequencing. The confirmed isogenic mutants were named:

459

PAO1-OprDE176X, PAO1-OprDQ250X, and PAO1-OprDS319X.

460
461

Complementation of the PAO1-OprDE176X, PAO1-OprDQ250X, and PAO1-OprDS319X mutants

was performed using a pMRS101 plasmid construct with the wild-type oprD gene encoded

463

and the same methodologies employed to generate the original mutations. Complemented

A detailed description of all steps is provided in the supporting information. Briefly, C18

468

reverse phase chromatography was performed on whole protein preparations from the cell

469

pellets of PAO1, each isogenic mutant and its complement. Data-dependent acquisition

470

(DDA) runs were performed to identify sequence coverage of the OprD protein and generate

471

a spectral library and scheduled targeted PRM runs for targeted verification. Protein

472

identification was performed using MaxQuant (v1.6.2.6) (Cox & Mann, 2008, Cox,

473

Neuhauser et al., 2011). The results were visualised using Perseus (Tyanova, Temu et al.,

475

pairs (transitions) from the DDA dataset (MacLean, Tomazela et al., 2010, Schilling, Rardin

As an indicator of in vitro fitness, the growth of each isogenic mutant was compared to that

of PAO1. 200µL of a culture containing 1.0–1.5 x 106 colony-forming units/mL in Luria-

Variant-specific PCR

488

Variant-specific PCR assays were designed to rapidly screen a collection of AUST-02

489

(n=569) and AUST-06 (n=321) isolates for target oprD SNPs. These isolates originated from

490

sputum of 149 participants (median [range], 6 [1-19] isolates/person). Primer sequences are

Data analyses

508

Statistical analyses were generated using IBM SPSS v22. MICs were compared using a

509

Mann-Whitney U test or a Kruskal-Wallis test with the Bonferroni adjustment applied.

510

Categorical data were compared using Pearson’s Chi-squared test. Based on the outcome of

511

the variant-specific PCRs, participants were categorised as either cases (PCR positive for a

512

target oprD SNP) or control subjects (PCR negative) and clinical characteristics of each

513

group were described using descriptive statistics. For cases, data relate to the date of first

514

detection of a strain that tested positive for a target SNP. For controls, data relate to the date

515

of first detection of AUST-02 or AUST-06. Participants (n=9) with only one isolate were

516

reported according to that PCR result. Potential predictors of being a case were identified by

517

univariate analysis as having p≤0.15 and examined in a multivariable logistic regression

518

model using backwards stepwise selection; variables expected to affect risk (age and type of

519

shared strain infection) were retained to control for any potential confounding effects. Prior

520

to their inclusion variables were checked for collinearity. Adjusted odds and 95% confidence

521

intervals are reported. Cox regression was used to assess the association between being a case

522

with time to lung transplantation or death. For patients who had not had a transplant and were

still alive, time was censored on the 31st August 2017. The Cox regression model also

THE PAPER EXPLAINED

554
555

Problem

556

Pseudomonas aeruginosa is the most important pathogen chronically infecting the lungs of

557

people with cystic fibrosis (CF) and cross-infection of strains (shared strains) can occur. P.

558

aeruginosa is known to develop antimicrobial resistance (AMR) including to carbapenem

559

antibiotics, which are often reserved for people with the most advanced disease. Despite

560

reports of reduced susceptibility of CF P. aeruginosa to carbapenems, the underlying

561

resistance mechanisms are less clear. Studies have also shown that as P. aeruginosa adapts to

562

persist in the CF lungs during long-term antibiotic treatment, certain genes are more prone to

563

mutation than others. However, there is limited information on whether mutations in AMR-

564

related genes (e.g. oprD) are characteristic of particular shared strain genotypes or whether

565

novel variants are generally observed in individual patient isolates. Importantly, there is a

566

paucity of data on whether the chromosomal mutations observed are of any clinical

567

relevance.

568
569

Results

570

In this study, we performed a detailed analysis of the oprD gene, which is hypothesised to

571

play an important role in adaptation of P. aeruginosa to the CF lungs, and AMR in two

572

shared strains that are prevalent in our patient population. We identified commonly occurring

573

oprD allelic variants in isolates from multiple patients, that were unique to specific shared-

574

strain lineages suggesting that successful oprD alleles emerge and persist in these shared

575

strain populations. By constructing and characterising P. aeruginosa oprD mutants, we show

576

that these variants are likely to contribute to reduced carbapenem susceptibility without

577

compromising in vitro fitness. We also identified a subset of people infected with the shared

578

strains with poorer clinical outcomes, including an increased hazard rate of death or lung

579

transplantation, based on detection of specific oprD variants.

580
581

Impact

582

Our findings emphasise the role of oprD mutations in carbapenem resistance in the setting of

583

P. aeruginosa lung infections in CF. Further our findings highlight the importance of

584

thorough investigations of genes under strong antimicrobial selection pressure to help

585

improve our understanding of (1) chronic-stage P. aeruginosa adaptions that may contribute

586

to strain transmissibility and (2) the greater adverse patient outcomes observed in some

587

people with CF despite infection with clonally-related strains.

Definitions: D + FH, diabetes with fasting hyperglycaemia; IGT, impaired glucose tolerance; Normal GT, normal glucose tolerance; FEV1 % predicted, forced expiratory
volume in the first second percent predicted; BMI, body mass index; CFTR, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR function: residual function,
harbouring ≥1 allele with Class IV-V mutations; minimal function, harbouring two alleles with Class I-III mutations; non-classified, harbouring two alleles with mutations of
unknown function).
‡
Cases, tested positive for ≥1 isolate with a target oprD SNP (one case lacked clinical data and was excluded from the analysis); control subjects, tested negative for isolates
with a target oprD SNP. Data collected relate to the date of first detection of AUST-02 and/or AUST-06 with a target SNP or to the date of first detection of AUST-02 and/or
AUST-06 if always tested negative.
†
All odds ratios presented are adjusted for age and shared strain infection (AUST-02, AUST-06 or mixed) due to their expected effects on odds of testing positive for an
isolate with a target SNP in oprD; however, these potential confounders were never statistically significant in any of the models. Odds of being a case compared to being a
control.
