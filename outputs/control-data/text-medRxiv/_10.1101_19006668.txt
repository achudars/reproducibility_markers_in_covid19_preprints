Abstract
Importance: Depleted skeletal muscle mass (sarcopenia) is associated with decreased survival
and cancer control in head and neck cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. There is a need
for validated measures of body composition that can be implemented in routine clinical
workflow.
Objective: To validate the use of bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) for body composition
analysis and diagnosis of sarcopenia in head and neck cancer patients.
Design: In this prospective observational cohort study, baseline 50 patients with head and neck
cancer undergoing radiation therapy (RT) were enrolled between February 2016 and March
2017. Baseline BIA measures of skeletal muscle (SM) mass, fat-free mass (FMM), and fat mass
(FM) were compared to CT-based estimates of body composition using linear regression. Sexspecific BIA-derived thresholds for sarcopenia were defined by the maximum Youden Index on
receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves of BIA against CT-defined sarcopenia. Changes
in body composition across treatment were compared against changes in body weight using
linear regression.
Participants: In total, 50 patients with pathologically confirmed stage I to IVB non-metastatic
head and neck cancer treated with definitive radiation therapy were enrolled.
Setting: Single academic referral center.
Main Outcome and Measure: The primary outcome was relative agreement between baseline
lean body mass and fat body mass predicted from BIA measurement and CT imaging.
Results: Of the 48 evaluable patients 16 (33.3%) were sarcopenic at baseline based on CT
analysis. BIA measures of body composition were strongly correlated with CT measures: SM
mass (r = 0.97; R2 = 0.94; p < 0.0001), FFM (r = 0.97; R2 = 0.94; p < 0.0001) and FM (r = 0.95;
R2 = 0.90; p < 0.0001). Relationship with normalized indices of SM mass, FFM, and FM was
similar between BIA and CT, but not BIA and body mass index (BMI). Patients lost a mean of

5.7 ± 5.8 kg during treatment, of which 1.5 ± 1.9 kg was SM, 2.6 ± 3.3 kg was FFM, and 2.2 ±
2.6 kg was FM. Eight additional patients developed sarcopenia by the end of RT.
Conclusions: BIA provides accurate estimates of body composition in head and neck cancer
patients. Implementation of BIA in clinical practice may identify patients with sarcopenia.

Background
Head and neck cancer patients with decreased muscle mass, or sarcopenia, exhibit poor
survival and locoregional cancer control as well as impaired tolerance of RT and increased
chemotherapy toxicity.1-6 Weight loss itself shows little correlation with oncologic or functional
outcomes, and weight-derived metrics, such as body mass index (BMI), are unable to
differentiate between the lean and adipose contributions to body mass.7 The gold standard for
body composition measurement is dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), with more recent
data validating the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or CT.8-10 However, these
modalities are expensive, involve radiation exposure (in the case of CT and DEXA), and are
often not pragmatic or available at radiation treatment centers. Furthermore, body composition
analysis of CT or MRI scans is not routinely performed, so this information is unavailable for
clinical use. Therefore, there is a need for body composition evaluation that can be rapidly
implemented into routine clinical workflow.
BIA offers a non-invasive, cost-effective method for serially measuring body
composition.11 BIA measures impedance to a weak electric current to estimate the relative fat
and water content of the body. In a healthy patient population, BIA estimates of body
composition did not differ significantly from estimates derived from the four-compartment model,
as shown by high coefficients of determination (R2, 0.94-0.98) and low root mean square error
(RMSE, -0.2-0.3 kg) across multiple ethnic populations.12 Head and neck cancer patients
represent a more challenging population given wide fluctuations in hydration status, nutrition,
and muscle mass. The accuracy of BIA in a head and neck cancer population has not been
previously evaluated.
The primary objective of this study was to validate eight-electrode multifrequency BIA as
a means to assess body composition against CT-based estimates in a head and neck cancer
population undergoing RT. CT-based estimates were selected as the gold standard due to the
previously described association between this measure of body composition and survival in this

patient population. Secondary objectives were to serially examine the change in weight and
body composition during RT using BIA.

Materials and methods
Study Design
Between February 2016 and March 2017, 50 patients were enrolled at The University of
Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center during their treatment planning visits. Patients eligible for
enrollment were age ≥ 18 years with pathologically confirmed head and neck cancer, AJCC 7th
edition stage Tx-T4, N0-3, M0, dispositioned to RT to a dose of ≥ 60 Gy either as single
modality or as part of a multimodality treatment approach. Additionally, they required a staging
PET/CT scan within a 30-day period prior to initiation of RT. Exclusion criteria included prior
overlapping RT, pregnancy, or concomitant medical conditions known to cause cachexia or
sarcopenia. All patients underwent treatment per consensus recommendation by
multidisciplinary tumor board, without regard for study inclusion. This study was approved by the
institutional review board of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Written
informed consent was obtained from all study participants.
Serial BIA measures were performed at the pre-treatment quality assurance visit and
during weekly on-treatment clinic visits. All patients undergoing RT received institutional
standard pre-treatment speech and swallow evaluations and weekly dietary counseling by
licensed dietitians. Feeding tubes were placed only therapeutically; no prophylactic feeding
tubes were offered. Patient demographics and treatment and tumor characteristics were
abstracted from the electronic medical record.
Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis
Body composition was measured using the FDA-cleared SECA medical Body
Composition Analyzer (mBCA) 515 scale (https://www.seca.com/en_no/products/allproducts/product-details/seca515.html; seca gmbh & co. kg, Hamburg, Germany). One of three

possible hand positions was selected such that the angle between the body and arms was as
close to 30 degrees as possible. Impedance is measured using a 100 μA current delivered at 19
frequencies ranging from 1-1000 kHz.12 To avoid additional barriers to adequate nutrition and
exercise, participants were not instructed to alter their food intake or activity prior to
measurement. For each measure, patients removed their shoes and socks and emptied their
pockets. Estimations of body composition were based on equations previously validated in
healthy adults and incorporated into vendor-supplied SECA analytics 115 software (SECA North
America, Chino, CA).12 BIA data were measured prior to RT initiation (baseline), then at weekly
clinic visits during treatment. Measurements were stored outside the patients’ medical records
and were not used for medical decision making.
CT Image Analysis
Cross-sectional images of the third lumbar vertebrae (L3) were extracted from the CT
component of pre-RT whole-body diagnostic PET-CT scans for each participant.9,13-15 Both SM
mass and FM were calculated from L3 contours, as previously described.9 The mean crosssectional area of muscle and adipose tissue was divided by the square of height in meters to
normalize for patient height and reported as the lumbar SM index (SMI) or adipose index
(ADI).9,13,15 SM depletion was defined a priori as an SMI of less than 52.4 for men and less than
38.5 for women.1,15,16
Statistical analysis
Data are presented as means ± SD. Differences between groups were assessed using
the 2-tailed Student’s t test (for continuous variables) and Pearson χ2 test or Fisher’s Exact Test
(for categorical variables). Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05.
For the primary outcome, we used linear regression analysis to determine the relative
agreement between baseline lean body mass and fat mass predicted from impedance

measurement and CT imaging. The Pearson correlation, r, between BIA and CT imaging
estimates of lean and fat body mass before RT as well as the coefficient of determination, R2,
were calculated. Both sexes were included in correlation calculations as these relationships are
age and sex invariant.8 RMSE analysis was utilized to quantify the average error from BIAderived body composition calculations. The following BIA-derived body composition estimates
were compared against CT-measured tissue Cross-Sectional Area (CSA): SM mass, FFM, and
FM. Comparisons of SM mass against CT CSA were repeated for each body segment (torso, R
& L legs, R & L arms). Height-normalized BIA estimates were compared against CT-derived
SMI and ADI as well as BMI. To identify BIA-based thresholds for sarcopenia, ROC analyses
were performed using the sex-specific CT-based sarcopenia definitions as ground truth. BIA
sarcopenia thresholds were defined by identifying the optimal threshold from the ROC analyses
based on maximum Youden Index—the value of the tested variable at which the sum of
sensitivity and specificity is greatest. To evaluate whether weight loss during RT reflects
changes in body composition, the changes in each BIA-measured tissue compartment and BMI
were calculated by subtracting the baseline value from the measurement during the final week
of treatment. R2 and RMSE were calculated from linear regression analysis comparing change
in SM mass, FFM, and FM to change in BIA.
Results
Patient Characteristics
Fifty patients were enrolled, and 48 patients remained in the study and evaluable. Two
patients withdrew consent to the study, and no data were collected. Two other patients
requested to withdraw from the study because their treatment occurred offsite; their baseline
data were included in analysis. The study population characteristics were comparable with the
overall population of head and neck cancer patients treated with RT. Patients had a mean age
of 60.2 (12.2) years at enrollment. The patient sample was predominately male (40 men [83.3%]
vs 8 women [16.7%]) with mean BMI of 30.0 (4.5) for men and 24.3 (5.4) for women. The

oropharynx was the most common primary cancer site, with 26 cases (54.2%). The majority of
patients (28 [58.3%]) had multiple involved lymph nodes at diagnosis (AJCC 7th edition N2-3).
Human papillomavirus was detected by p16 immunohistochemistry or HPV polymerase chain
reaction in all 26 oropharynx cancer patients (54.2%) and was not tested in 19 other patients
(39.6%). Forty-seven of 48 patients (97.9%) had ECOG PS 0-1. Patient and treatment
characteristics are outlined in Table 1.
Whole body BIA vs. CT analysis
At the time of enrollment, no patients were underweight (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2), 8 patients
(17%) had normal BMI (18.5-24.9), 23 patients (48%) were overweight (BMI 25-29.9), and 17
patients (35%) were obese (BMI ≥ 30). By CT analysis, 16 patients (33%) were sarcopenic at
the time of enrollment. Full body composition details measured by CT and BIA are shown in
Table 2. Age, height, tumor site, T stage, N stage, grade, HPV status, smoking status, and use
of induction chemotherapy did not vary by sarcopenic status (Supplementary Table 1).
To determine whether BIA could accurately replicate CT-derived body composition
metrics, we conducted a series of linear regressions. We first evaluated the relationships
between BIA measures of SM mass, FFM, and FM against unnormalized CT-derived SM and
adipose CSA (Figure 1). BIA SM mass was highly correlated to CT SM CSA with SM mass (kg)
= 0.511 + 0.173 x [SM CSA at L3 (cm2)], r = 0.97; p < 0.0001. BIA FFM was also closely
associated with CT SM CSA; FFM (kg) = 12.177 + 0.293 x [SM CSA at L3 (cm2)], r = 0.97; p <
0.0001. BIA accurately represented CT measures of fat mass; FM mass (kg) = 4.882 + 0.074 x
[Adipose CSA at L3 (cm2)], r = 0.95; p < 0.0001.
Because thresholds for survival-associated sarcopenia are based on normalized body
composition indices, we repeated these correlations using normalized tissue compartment
measures. For BIA, this includes the SM index (SMI), FFM index (FFMI), and FM index (FMI),
each of which is automatically calculated by dividing the measured mass value by the square of

height in meters. Linear regression revealed close associations between BIA and CT (Figure
2A-2C):
•

BIA SMI (kg/m2) = 0.271 + 0.171 x [CT SMI (kg/m2)]; r = 0.95, p < 0.0001

•

BIA FFMI (kg/m2) = 5.778 + 0.255 x [CT SMI (kg/m2)]; r = 0.93, p < 0.0001

•

BIA FMI (kg/m2) = 1.974 + 0.069 x [CT ADI (kg/m2)]; r = 0.95, p < 0.0001

We then tested the association between BIA measures of body composition and BMI, to identify
which tissue compartments are best estimated by BMI. BIA measures were less closely
associated with BMI than CT, with the strongest association seen between BIA FMI and BMI
(Figure 2D-2F):
•

BIA SMI (kg/m2) = 1.173 + 0.128 x [BMI (kg/m2)]; r = 0.80, p < 0.0001

•

BIA FFMI (kg/m2) = 6.741 + 0.433 x [BMI (kg/m2)]; r = 0.81, p < 0.0001

•

BIA FMI (kg/m2) = 6.744 + 0.568 x [BMI (kg/m2)]; r = 0.88, p < 0.0001

Segmental BIA vs. CT analysis
The 8-electrode design of the BIA device used in this study allows for independent
estimates of SM mass and FM in each limb and the torso. To determine which body segment
provided the best reflection of CT-based SM mass, we ran a series of linear regressions,
plotting SM mass from the torso, right and left legs, and right and left arms against CT SM CSA
at the L3 level. These regressions show that each body segment is independently closely
associated with L3 SM CSA. The left and right arms have the highest correlation (left arm, R2 =
0.92, RMSE = 0.17; right arm, R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.16), whereas the legs exhibit the lowest
(left leg, R2 = 0.90, RMSE = 0.41; right leg, R2 = 0.88, RMSE = 0.46). The torso demonstrated
the highest error among segments (R2 = 0.91, RMSE = 1.14), although this is likely driven by
having the largest absolute mass value.
BIA-defined sarcopenia

Having observed close correlation between BIA and CT measured SM mass estimates,
we then sought to use these relationships to define sex-specific BIA cutoffs for sarcopenia. For
each BIA measure of SM mass or FFM, we performed ROC analysis using CT-defined
sarcopenia as the “positive” level. The maximum Youden Index value was used to select the
optimum cut-off defining sarcopenia. Sensitivity and specificity were then calculated for each
regressor using the optimized threshold. For men, optimal cutoffs for SM mass and FFM, both
raw and normalized to the square of height in meters, demonstrated high sensitivity and
specificity for defining sarcopenia, as evidenced by ROC c-statistics > 0.92 (Table 3). The best
discriminator for sarcopenia, as defined by the highest ROC c-statistic, was SM mass index <
9.19 kg/m2 for men (c-statistic 0.964, sensitivity 91.7%, specificity 92.9%). Analysis of the
optimized cut-off in women was limited by the small number of women in the study. Despite this,
discriminatory performance was also highest when using SM mass index < 6.53 kg/m2 (cstatistic 1.0, sensitivity 100%, specificity 0%).
Muscle, Fat, and Weight Loss during RT
Patients lost an average of 5.7 ± 5.8 kg during treatment, with mean BMI dropping from
29.4 ± 5.5 kg/m2, to 27.8 ± 4.7 kg/m2 at treatment completion (Supplementary Figure 1). SM
mass decreased by a mean of 1.5 ± 1.9 kg during treatment from 29.8 ± 7.6 kg to 28.3 ± 6.7 kg.
FFM decreased by a mean of 2.6 ± 3.3 kg from a mean of 61.8 ± 13.0 kg to 59.2 ± 11.6 kg.
Mean FM loss was 2.2 ± 2.6 kg, from an initial mean FM of 30.7 ± 12.0 kg to 28.5 ± 10.9 kg.
Patients lost an average of 0.8 ± 1.8 kg of total body water during RT. Using the BIA measured
sex-specific SMI cutoffs for sarcopenia described above, the number of patients with sarcopenia
increased from 16 (34.7%) prior to RT, to 23 (50%) post-RT (n=46). Eight patients developed
sarcopenia during RT, whereas one sarcopenic patient no longer met the criteria for sarcopenia
at treatment completion. Therapeutic feeding tubes were placed in 7 non-sarcopenic patients
(23.3%) and 3 sarcopenic patients (18.8%).

Discussion
To our knowledge this study is the first prospective validation of BIA as a measure of
sarcopenia. BIA measures of body composition were very strongly correlated with CT-based
estimates, validating BIA as an accurate alternative measure for sarcopenia in a clinical head
and neck cancer population. The close associations between BIA and CT were observed
despite methodology that did not control for variations in eating, drinking, or exercising prior to
BIA. Given the difficulties in maintaining nutrition exhibited by many head and neck cancer
patients, we felt it is important to derive meaningful results without the need for fasting or other
metabolic challenges. BIA was easy to perform and was readily integrated into a busy radiation
oncology clinic; in our study weekly BIA was performed by registered dieticians and took
approximately 2 minutes per visit. In contrast to DEXA, which is seldom available in radiation
centers, or CT or MRI, which are expensive to perform and require dedicated post-hoc analysis,
BIA provided rapid results that were immediately interpretable. Given the plurality of studies
reporting an association between depleted SM mass and shortened survival, interrogation of
body composition can help clinicians with a priori risk stratification and may prove useful in
selecting optimal treatment regimens amid ongoing efforts to de-escalate therapy.
Once we had validated BIA measures of SM mass, we then used the relationship
between BIA and CT to identify normalized BIA-derived thresholds for identifying sarcopenia.
The thresholds identified in this study fall within the range of “moderate sarcopenia”, identified
by Janssen and colleagues as being associated with physical disability among older adults.17
That normalized SM mass values in this range are associated with poor outcomes in both
populations supports the interpretation that low muscle mass is a common indicator of
underlying pathology. However, because head and neck cancer is increasingly common among
younger patients, both age- and cancer-specific thresholds for sarcopenia may be necessary for
clinical utility.

Our results show no association between sarcopenia and other factors prognostic for
survival, including HPV status, smoking history, age, and tumor stage. Sarcopenia was equally
prevalent among patients with HPV-associated cancers, which often present with a small
primary tumor and involved neck lymph nodes. Whereas our retrospective data suggested that
sarcopenia portends worse outcomes in patients with HPV-associated cancers 1, recently
published retrospective data question this association.4 Thus, the prognostic value of
sarcopenia among HPV-positive cancers, which are typically associated with improved survival,
remains uncertain and should be the subject of future prospective analysis.
As a secondary outcome, we evaluated whether BIA was sensitive enough to monitor
individual changes in body composition across treatment. At present, body weight is the primary
indicator used to identify patients who need additional nutrition support, including dietetic
intervention or feeding tube placement. However, our prior retrospective report found that
increased weight loss was associated with improved survival and cancer control.1 This is
because the greatest weight loss was observed in obese patients, and obesity itself was
prognostic for better cancer-free and overall survival. In contrast, those patients who developed
sarcopenia between starting RT and their follow up imaging had poorer survival, reinforcing the
importance of knowing which tissues are driving weight loss. BIA offers more information than
body weight and may identify patients approaching the sarcopenia threshold. This could
potentially help stratify patients in nutritional and supportive care trials investigating nutritional,
exercise-based, and pharmacologic approaches to improving muscle mass. It seems logical that
strength training and adequate protein intake may help, and the DAHANCA group is
investigating this 18.
Limitations
The low number of women participants precludes generalizability of our findings to female
patients with head and neck cancer. Specific thresholds for BIA-determined sarcopenia need to
be validated and refined in larger studies that include greater numbers of women patients.

Evaluation of this technology in other cancer sites may demonstrate the need for cancer-specific
and age-specific sarcopenia cut-offs. Our study also did not include post-RT imaging to validate
the accuracy of post-treatment changes in body composition or the ability of BIA to identify newonset sarcopenia. Finally, this study did not include the long term oncologic and survival
outcomes for this population. Thus, we could not validate the previously described relationship
between sarcopenia and outcome in this population.
Conclusions
In this prospective validation study, BIA was closely correlated with CT-derived
measures of SM mass and FM. BIA demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for identifying
patients with sarcopenia, a negative prognostic factor in head and neck cancer. The use of BIA
may be a practical solution for identifying patients with sarcopenia in routine clinical practice.
