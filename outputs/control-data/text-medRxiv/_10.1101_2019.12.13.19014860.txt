Abstract

14

Background:

15

much recent work has focused on defining AD as a biological construct, most patients are still diagnosed,

16

staged, and treated based on their cognitive symptoms. But the cognitive capability of a patient at any

17

time throughout this deterioration will not directly reflect the disease state, but rather the effect of the

18

cognitive decline on the patient’s predisease cognitive capability. Patients with high predisease cognitive

19

capabilities tend to score better on cognitive tests relative to patients with low predisease cognitive

20

capabilities at the same disease stage. Thus, a single assessment with a cognitive test is not adequate for

21

determining the stage of an AD patient.

22

Methods and Findings:

23

baseline cognition, and the patients’ individual changes in cognitive ability as latent variables. The

24

developed model takes the form of a nonlinear mixed-effects model. Maximum-likelihood estimation in

25

this model induces a data-driven criterion for separating disease progression and baseline cognition.

26

Applied to data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, the model estimated a timeline of

27

cognitive decline in AD that spans approximately 15 years from the earliest subjective cognitive deficits

28

to severe AD dementia. It was demonstrated how direct modeling of latent factors that modify the

29

observed data patterns provide a scaffold for understanding disease progression, biomarkers and

30

treatment effects along the continuous time progression of disease.

31

Conclusions:

32

decline. The results give new insights to the value of biomarkers for staging patients and suggest

33

alternative explanations for previous findings related to accelerated cognitive decline among highly

34

educated patients and patients on symptomatic treatments.

The characterizing symptom of Alzheimer disease (AD) is cognitive deterioration. While

I developed a joint statistical model that explicitly modeled disease stage,

The suggested framework enables direct interpretations of factors that modify cognitive

1. Background

39

Alzheimer disease (AD) is slowly progressing with preclinical and prodromal phases lasting many years

40

before the onset of dementia. The stage of the underlying disease process of an AD patient entering a

41

clinical trial is largely unknown, but may be estimated by a combination of, for example, cognitive

42

testing, clinical evaluation, and biomarker results. While these procedures for evaluating disease

43

severity are useful for creating coarse groupings of patients, the factors used to create groupings may be

44

systematically affected by a wealth of factors not directly tied to the disease process, for example,

45

intelligence, level of education, comorbidities, and genetics.

46

So far, efforts to develop therapies that delay or halt the progression of AD have generally been

47

unsuccessful, and the vast majority of trials testing symptomatic agents in AD have also failed. These

48

failures may be due to wrong therapeutic targets or non-efficacious therapies, but it is possible that a

49

proportion of trial failures could be attributed to other factors such as study design, endpoints, and non-

50

optimal patient population selection. For disease-modifying drugs, for example, the current standard

51

durations for interventional studies may not be adequate. Simulations based on cohort studies suggest

52

that prevention of disease in cognitively normal individuals may require study lengths far beyond the

53

current standard to achieve high statistical power for detecting an effect of even very efficacious drugs

54

[1,2], and this may also be the case for secondary prevention studies.

1.1 Cognitive decline and symptom onset

56

The characterizing symptom of AD is cognitive deterioration. The cognitive capability of a patient at any

57

time throughout this deterioration will not directly reflect the disease state, but the effect of the

58

cognitive decline on the patient’s predisease cognitive capability.

59

Many factors influence instantaneous cognitive ability, and low cognitive ability at a single time point is

60

not necessarily an indication of cognitive decline. Cognitive decline can only be established by repeated

61

evaluations of patients’ cognition over time. Longitudinal assessments of patient cognition also offer the

62

benefit of hindsight – once cognitive decline is established; one can traverse back in time along the

63

cognitive trajectory and predict when the decline started and search for patterns that are indicative of

64

future cognitive decline. If done properly, one can synchronize individual observed trajectories to one

65

long-term timeline representative of the full span of cognitive decline over the disease

66

Age is typically considered the major risk factor for developing AD, but age of first diagnosis of AD can

67

vary by decades between patients, and because this span is much greater than the entire course of

68

cognitive decline associated with AD, patient age is not an appropriate scale for understanding the

69

pattern of cognitive decline in AD. The natural scale for studying the patterns of cognitive decline is time

70

since symptom onset. However, self- or caregiver-reported age of symptom onset may be imprecise due

71

to the patient’s memory problems; recall bias, where early sporadic cognitive issues are believed to be

72

symptoms of the disease; or personal differences in sensitivity and interpretation of the earliest

73

cognitive problems.

74

1.2. Disease progression modeling

75

Alzheimer disease typically presents in a sporadic late-onset form. The autosomal dominant forms of AD

76

(ADAD) caused by rare genetic mutations have earlier onset than sporadic AD, but otherwise the

77

pathogenesis is largely similar [3]. In ADAD, age at symptom onset is strongly affected by mutation type,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014860; this version posted December 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this

78

parental age at symptom onset, APOE genotype and sex [4]. These factors can be used to calculate

79

expected patient age at symptom onset for ADAD patients, which can be used to construct a more

80

synchronized time scale for studying biomarkers and the pathological cascade of the disease [5].

81

Furthermore, this makes it possible to do primary prevention studies in a highly efficient manner [6].

82

In sporadic AD, age at onset cannot be predicted accurately from demographic or genetic factors.

83

Assessment of biomarkers such as amyloid and tau load in cerebrospinal fluid or by positron emission

84

tomography may be used to diagnose the disease even in the earliest stages [7], but such assessments

85

can be both invasive and expensive, and data is sparse. There are however rich datasets with

86

longitudinal cognitive measurements that span different parts of the disease. An appealing use of this

87

data is to assemble the individual observed short-term trajectories to one long-term timeline

88

representative of the full span of cognitive decline over the disease.

89

Different approaches to construct disease progression models for AD have been taken. A classic

90

approach is to formulate the changes in cognitive scores using differential equations [8,9,10,11]. One

91

major drawback of this type of modeling is that covariate effects and different sources of random

92

variation should be formulated in the differential equation framework and may be very difficult to

93

handle and interpret. An alternative class of disease progression models is based on direct modeling of

94

the observed longitudinal trajectories and explicit modeling the patient-level disease stage. An

95

important example of this type of approach is the model by Donohue et al. [12] which simultaneously

96

models multiple observations of cognitive measures and biomarkers. This modeling approach has been

97

powerful in illuminating the multivariate nature of Alzheimer disease progression, but it does have some

98

drawbacks. In particular, the model assumes that all included outcomes are synchronized over a

99

common disease time scale; it does not model correlations between outcomes; it does not include

100

covariates; and finally, it uses a heuristic estimation procedure that does not simultaneously account for

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014860; this version posted December 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this

101

the assumed random variability in both timing and measurements. The approach was recently

102

generalized to a wider class of Bayesian latent-time joint mixed-effects models [13]. This class of models

103

can in principle take advantage of the dependence between different outcomes and allow inclusion of

104

covariates, but covariates can only model variation in outcomes and not disease stage or progression

105

rate. Furthermore, the Bayesian element of the model requires somewhat arbitrary choices of priors for

106

different model parameters. Progression is modeled on an age scale and, as discussed above, this choice

107

may amplify the a-priori dis-synchronization between patients by orders of magnitude. This in turn

108

negatively affects the results of the model as can be seen in Figure 1 in the paper [13] where patient-

109

level trajectories go from minimal to maximal severity over 10-15 years, while variation of when

110

maximal severity is reached between patients is spread out over 20-year periods.

111

In this paper, we propose a new approach to disease progression modeling that overcomes several of

112

the shortcomings of the above-mentioned methods. In the presented form, the model is estimating a

113

disease timeline from repeated assessments of a univariate measure such as a cognitive scale. The

114

model is inspired by the statistical framework presented by Raket et al. [14] where systematic patterns

115

of variation in both vertical (observed cognitive score) and horizontal (disease-timing) directions are

116

modeled simultaneously on both the population and individual level. The model allows covariate effects

117

on both outcomes and disease progression and all model parameters are estimated simultaneously

118

using maximum likelihood estimation.

119

The goal of this work was to explore whether the proposed disease progression model could align

120

observed cognitive trajectories to a precise timeline of cognitive decline associated with AD and to

121

evaluate if this modeling would shed new light on aspects related to disease progression and

122

biomarkers. When the model was fitted to cognitive scores from ADNI, the presented model aligned the

123

cognitive trajectories of patients to a consistent shape of cognitive decline with a span of approximately

124

15 years from the earliest subjective cognitive deficits to severe AD dementia. It was shown that the

125

model’s predictions of patients’ disease stages based on their longitudinal cognitive scores could predict

126

time since symptom onset and diagnosis. It was further demonstrated that the predicted disease stages

127

provided a more suitable time scale for modeling the evolution of biomarkers over the course of disease

128

than group-wise modeling based on patient symptoms at baseline. The model was used to estimate the

129

effects of sex, age, and education on cognitive decline and to evaluate the effects of cholinesterase

130

inhibitor treatment on cognitive decline. Finally, the model was fitted to the cognitive trajectories of a

131

subset of patients with a rich set of biomarkers available at baseline to estimate if baseline biomarker

132

profile could predict disease stage. The results of the model in an independent held-out validation data

133

set confirmed that baseline biomarker profiles could predict the disease stage of unseen individuals –

134

even in the preclinical phases of disease where no clinically detectable cognitive impairment is present.

2. Methods

136

2.1. Data

137

Data used in the preparation of this article were obtained from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging

138

Initiative (ADNI) database (adni.loni.usc.edu). The ADNI was launched in 2003 as a public-private

139

partnership, led by Principal Investigator Michael W. Weiner, MD. The primary goal of ADNI has been to

140

test whether serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), positron emission tomography (PET), other

141

biological markers, and clinical and neuropsychological assessment can be combined to measure the

142

progression of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and early Alzheimer’s disease (AD). For up-to-date

143

information, see www.adni-info.org.

144

Patients included in the current study were required to have a valid classification at baseline (cognitively

145

normal, significant memory concern, mild cognitive impairment [early], mild cognitive impairment [late],

146

or dementia).

Outcomes

148

The main outcome measure considered was the total score of the 13-item Alzheimer’s Disease

149

Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog; range: 0-85; lower score indicates less impairment)

150

[15]. Included patients were required to have at least one valid ADAS-cog total score to be included in

151

the present study.

152

Other outcomes were reported onset of various symptoms related to cognitive impairment and AD;

153

Clinical Dementia Rating scale – sum of boxes [16]; Functional Activities Questionnaire [17], FDG-PET

154

(meta-ROI) [18]; cross-sectional hippocampal volume extracted from MRI using FreeSurfer [19];

155

Florbetapir PET SUVr [20]; Aβ1-42, total tau, and p-tau181 concentrations in CSF as measured using the

Roche Elecsys® immunoassay [21]; the ratio of Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 concentrations in CSF as measured by 2D-

157

UPLC tandem mass spectrometry; and Neurofilament Light chain (NfL) levels in plasma measured using a

158

single molecule array platform [22].

185

When modeling longitudinal data for groups of individuals it is often natural to describe systematic

186

differences between individuals using random effect. The proposed disease progression model has three

types of random effects.

2.3. Statistical analysis

215

To investigate the effect of covariates on the pattern of disease progression, forward selection was used

216

to evaluate models with all combinations of covariate effects on rate of decline , disease stage , and

217

predisease cognition . The search was continued as long as the Akaike Information Criterion [25]

218

improved, but the model selection was based on the more conservative Schwarz’ Bayesian Information

219

Criterion (BIC) [26].

220

To investigate if predicted disease time was predictive of time since reported symptom onset, linear

221

regression was done on time since reported symptom onset (at baseline) using predicted disease time

222

as a covariate. P-values were computed using T-tests.

223

To investigate if predicted disease time offered a better time scale for modeling other longitudinal

224

outcomes (e.g. biomarkers) than time since baseline for the five baseline groups, linear mixed effects

225

modeling was used. To allow for nonlinear trends in the mean pattern, the outcome was modeled using

226

a cubic B-spline function with 3 degrees of freedom across predicted disease time and time since

227

baseline (one pattern per baseline group), respectively. Patient-level random slopes and intercepts were

228

included to model longitudinal deviations within an individual. P-values were computed using likelihood

229

ratio tests with maximum likelihood estimation.

3. Results

237

3.1 Basic model

238

The basic model described in Section 2.2 was fitted on longitudinal ADAS-cog data from ADNI. The data

239

comprised 9,830 ADAS-cog scores across 2,142 individuals. The ADAS-cog scores plotted against study

240

time and predicted time-scales (“disease month”) are shown in Figure 1. Relative to the average

241

baseline disease stage of the Cognitively normal group the model estimated that the Significant memory

242

concern group were 29 months later into the trajectory of cognitive decline, while the early and late MCI

243

groups were respectively 42 and 88 months later, and that the dementia group was 136 months later.

244

The model had 12 degrees of freedom, and the log likelihood of the fitted model was -29734.26. AIC and

245

BIC were 59492.52 and 59578.84 respectively.

3.2 Validation of the basic model

251

The presented disease progression model aggregates the information in baseline status groups and the

252

longitudinal trajectories of participants to a single number, the predicted disease month. For this

253

continuous disease progression scale to relevant to AD, it should also hold information that describe

254

other aspects of the disease than the cognitive deterioration observed on ADAS-cog that the model was

255

fitted on.

256

To first evaluate whether the disease progression model captured milestones of cognitive deterioration,

257

we evaluated the model’s ability to predict self-reported onset of cognitive symptoms, mild cognitive

258

impairment symptoms, Alzheimer’s disease symptoms or diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease. There were

259

1.142 participants who had at least one entry of these data during the study follow-up. Age of symptom

260

onset or diagnosis plotted against the age at the model’s predicted disease time 0 is shown in Figure 2.

261

Ideally (based on perfectly aligned trajectories and perfect self-reported onsets/diagnosis between

262

individuals) the results of each measure would lie on a line with slope 1 and the intercept would

263

represent the difference in years between age at disease time 0 and the age at onset/diagnosis time. For

264

the age of onset of cognitive symptoms, there seems to be different intercepts for the different baseline

265

groups, where more severe baseline groups tend to report symptom onset later relative to the model

266

prediction of the less severe groups. This may be an effect of different subjective definitions of onset of

267

cognitive symptoms across baseline groups; it may be because of biased model estimates of the staging

268

of the baseline groups; or a combination.

269

Based on linear regression, predicted disease month was predictive of time since cognitive symptom

270

onset (p < 0.0001), time since Alzheimer’s disease symptoms onset (p < 0.0001) and time since

271

Alzheimer’s diagnosis (p < 0.0001) – all times relative to study baseline. Predicted disease month was

272

not significantly predictive for time since mild cognitive impairment symptom onset (p = 0.558).

278

Secondly, to validate that the predicted disease time also synchronizes other independently captured

279

aspects of the disease than cognition as measured by ADAS-cog, we analyzed if this continuous disease

280

scale based on baseline patient statuses and ADAS-cog trajectories better captured patterns of variation

281

in other clinical scales and biomarkers than separate modeling of the different baseline groups. We

282

found that the predicted disease time better described the patterns of variation compared to allowing

283

separate patterns per baseline group in 7 of the 10 cases when measured by log likelihood (Table 1),

284

even though the latter model had 16 degrees of freedom more than the former. When measured using

285

AIC and BIC that both adjust for additional degrees of freedom to compare model quality, the predicted

286

disease time model was better in 8 of the 10 cases for AIC and 10 of the 10 cases for BIC. Interestingly,

287

the three biomarkers where group-wise modeling was better as measured by log likelihood were all

288

measuring to beta amyloid (CSF Aβ1-42 and Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 ratio, Florbetapir PET). These biomarkers are

289

known to have a bimodal distribution [30] and are thus poorly modeled by a single trajectory. Figure 3

3.2 Age, sex, education and cognitive decline

303

There were systematic differences in follow-up time, age at baseline and length of education between

304

male and female participants (Supplementary Table 1). Compared to female participants, male

305

participants on average had 3.2 months longer follow-up (Wilcoxon p = 0.0085), were on average 2.0

306

years older at baseline (Wilcoxon p < 0.0001) and had 0.89 years more education (Wilcoxon p < 0.0001).

307

Age at baseline and years of education were not significantly correlated (Spearman’s ρ = –0.04, p =

308

0.0792).

309

To explore whether age at baseline, sex and length of education affected the pattern of cognitive

310

decline, stepwise forward model selection was done to include these factors in the model. The best

311

model included fixed effects of age and sex on ,  and , and fixed effects of years of education on 

312

and . While there were some substantial differences in marginal parameter estimates due to age, sex

313

and length of education (e.g. men are predicted to be 57 months later in disease compared to women in

314

the same baseline groups; Supplementary Table 2), the estimates should not be interpreted in isolation

315

since all parameters simultaneously affect the shape of the disease trajectory and may counteract each

316

other. Figure 4 shows how age, sex and education differences systematically affected the mean

317

trajectories. From the figure we see that male participants consistently scored lower on ADAS-cog

318

throughout the disease (3.1 points), but that they remained more stable in the initial 100 months where

319

female participants had a more gradual decline. Lower age at baseline and longer education were both

320

associated with higher cognitive scores, but also slightly increased rates of decline as evident in the

321

stages of overt dementia (predicted disease time >120 months).

3.3 Cholinesterase inhibitors and cognitive decline

328

Using the search terms described in the supplementary material, we identified 1,347 individuals that

329

were treated with cholinesterase inhibitors (ChEIs), but only 64 of these initiated or discontinued

330

treatment during the observation time (total of 9 initiations and 60 discontinuations).

331

To explore if treatment with ChEIs affected the shape of the decline trajectories, stepwise forward

332

model selection from the basic model was done to include ChEI treatment in the model. The best model

333

included fixed effects of treatment on  and , but not on rate of decline  (14 degrees of freedom, log

334

likelihood = -29638.79, AIC = 59305.59, BIC = 59406.29). The model found that patients treated with

3.4 Biomarkers for disease staging

346

The disease progression model relies on observing patients longitudinally and uses the temporal pattern

347

of cognitive scores to predict the patient’s status at baseline. This is valuable for increasing disease

348

understanding for cohorts or for doing retrospective analyses, but the models presented thus far offer

349

only little insight into the disease stage of a patient entering, for example, a clinical trial. In this setting,

350

only the baseline classification of the patient, the cognitive score and possibly other demographic data

351

would be able to inform the stage of the patient. However, as shown in Section 3.2, several biomarkers

352

have temporal patterns that follow the trajectory of cognitive decline. Biomarker data collected at

353

baseline may thus enable a better assessment of the stage of an individual.

354

688 individuals had complete biomarker data at baseline for the eight biomarkers considered in Section

355

3.2. These individuals had 3,301 visits with valid ADAS-cog scores.

356

Training and validation data

357

540 individuals (80%) were randomly selected for the training cohort and the remaining 148 (20%)

Model development

360

Using the BIC-based model selection procedure described previously, we searched for the best model

361

among models that included adjustment for sex, baseline age and education (on parameters , , ) as

362

well as adjustment for the eight baseline biomarkers on disease stage (parameter ). The model

363

selection was done on the training data. The best model included the biomarkers FDG-PET (meta-ROI),

364

hippocampal volume (MRI), Florbetapir PET SUVr, Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 (CSF), and NfL (plasma) (22 degrees of

365

freedom, log likelihood = -7591.17, AIC = 15226.34, BIC = 15355.45). The parameter estimates for the

366

model are given in Supplementary Table 3.

367

Model validation

368

To validate the biomarker model, the model fitted on training data was used to predict disease stage in

369

two different scenarios. The first used baseline biomarker data and the second used baseline biomarkers

370

in combination with baseline ADAS-cog total score. Visual inspection of the longitudinal ADAS-cog

371

trajectories suggests that the baseline data does hold information that improves prediction of disease

372

stage in the test data (Figure 6). To quantify this, the biomarker model was compared to the baseline

373

model on its predictive accuracy for the longitudinal ADAS-cog total score trajectories (Table 2).

374

Inclusion of biomarker data clearly reduced the mean squared error (MSE) and median absolute error

375

(MAE) of predictions on both test and training data (MSE/MAE 65.1/4.21 vs. 100.0/4.98 on test data).

376

Including the baseline ADAS-cog total score improved the post-baseline predictive accuracy of the

377

biomarker model further (MSE/MAE 55.1/3.48 for baseline biomarkers + ADAS-cog model vs. 69.8/4.31

378

for biomarker model on test data).

4. Discussion

393

Disease progression modeling

394

In this paper we presented a model for progression of dementia based on longitudinal cognitive

395

assessments. Disease stages of individual patients were modeled using a latent variable approach. As

396

opposed to conventional latent variable models, for example, in item response theory for modeling

397

cognitive tests [31,32], the proposed model imposes explicit structures to ensure that the longitudinal

398

modeling respects the known course of disease (e.g. that disease progression is an increasing function of

399

elapsed time and that cognition on average declines with disease progression). By imposing these

400

structures, the model provides a scaffold for understanding disease progression in pathological aging in

401

terms of three continuous measures, disease stage, rate of decline, and cognitive deviation from the

402

mean.

403

The proposed model aligned trajectories of cognitive decline, the characterizing symptom of dementia,

404

and to demonstrate that this approach provided valid insights about other aspects of the disease, it was

405

shown that predicted disease stage was predictive of various measures of disease onset. Furthermore,

406

the use of ADAS-cog trajectories to map patients to a one-dimensional disease timeline consistently

407

provided a better explanation of other clinical scales and biomarker trajectories than a conventional

408

approach that grouped patients based on baseline symptoms.

409

Age, sex, education and cognitive decline

410

The effect of demographic and socioeconomic factors on disease risk and manifestation in Alzheimer’s

411

disease has been the subject of much study. In this work we focused on the combined effects of age, sex

412

and length of education.

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014860; this version posted December 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this

413

When considered individually, these factors have been observed to result in differences in disease

414

progression. While age is typically considered the major risk factor for developing AD, higher age at AD

415

onset has been observed to be associated with a slower rate of cognitive decline [33,34]. Similarly,

416

female sex has been identified as a major risk factor with almost two-thirds of AD cases being women

417

[35]. While this difference has been known for a long time, it has only become apparent more recently

418

that there are sex differences in symptomatology, rate of decline, and possibly in neural anatomy

419

[36,37]. Finally, the effects of cognitive reserve on age-related cognitive decline has been the subject of

420

much study [38]. Cognitive reserve is often studied using educational attainment as an operational proxy

421

for cognitive reserve. It has consistently been found that higher education is associated with increased

422

rate of cognitive decline in incident Alzheimer’s disease [39,40,41,42,43,44,45]. Several of these studies

423

also report that education is associated with higher baseline cognition.

424

Differences in cognitive decline is often studied by comparing slopes in statistical models that assume

425

that cognitive decline follows a linear pattern. The argumentation and interpretation around the

426

cognitive reserve model is somewhat more sophisticated, but still largely centered on an assumption of

427

a linear rate of decline (e.g. illustrated in Figure 1 in [46]). The prevailing hypothesis within the field of

428

cognitive reserve research is that, compared to individuals with low cognitive reserve, individuals with

429

high cognitive reserve have higher predisease cognitive scores and that their brains tolerate a higher

430

load of neuropathology before cognitive decline is seen. At a sufficiently high level of neuropathology,

431

cognitive ability reaches its floor for all participants. If the timescale of neuropathological buildup is

432

similar across individuals, this suggests that individuals with high cognitive reserve will have to decline a

433

wider range of cognitive scores in a shorter time, thus leading to an accelerated rate of decline [46].

434

The analyses in the present paper clearly illustrate that rate of cognitive decline as measured on ADAS-

435

cog is not constant but increases over the course of AD. Thus, findings of an increased rate of decline in

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.13.19014860; this version posted December 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this

436

a certain group of patients using slope models could either be because the group of patients has

437

accelerated decline, because they are at a later disease stage, or a combination. The proposed disease

438

progression model seeks to align cognitive trajectories on a disease timeline, and thus it allows one to

439

separate the hypothesized mechanisms of cognitive decline. The best model that adjusted for effects of

440

age at baseline, sex, and length of education on, respectively, disease stage, rate of decline and

441

cognitive deviation, found that that all three factors affected all three disease measures except for

442

disease stage which was not affected by length of education.

443

When considering the combination of effects (Figure 4), the results suggested that higher age at

444

baseline was associated with lower cognition throughout disease time and a slightly reduced rate of

445

decline. Women tended to have better predisease cognition but also an accelerated decline. Finally,

446

longer education was associated with slightly faster rate of decline and a systematically better cognition

447

throughout the disease.

448

While these findings are largely consistent with previous findings, they also illustrate that previous

449

results that do not take the long-term disease trajectories into account may be systematically biased. In

450

particular, the fact that highly educated patients tend to have above-mean cognition throughout the

451

disease means that they will meet cognitive cut-offs used for inclusion criteria in clinical studies longer in

452

to their disease than patients with less education. Because of the accelerated cognitive decline in the

453

later stages of disease, these patients will have a much faster rate of decline when using conventional

454

slope models, but this difference will primarily be due to their later disease stage.

455

Symptomatic medications for Alzheimer disease and cognitive decline

456

ChEIs have consistently shown a symptomatic benefit in mild to severe dementia due to AD in

457

randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trials [47]. It has however been questioned whether long-

458

term treatment with ChEIs could be harmful [48]. A recent meta-analysis found that AD patients treated

459

with symptomatic treatments had a faster rate of cognitive decline [49]. This could be interpreted as a

460

harmful side effect, but since the included studies were not randomized with respect to symptomatic

461

treatments, such causal link cannot be made. An alternative explanation is simply that ChEIs work – that

462

patients that are being treated at study inclusion have a cognitive benefit that, similarly to higher levels

463

of education, means that they meet inclusion criteria for clinical studies further in to their disease. The

464

optimal disease progression model identified in the model search did not include effects of ChEI

465

treatment on rate of decline. Instead, the results of this model showed that patients treated generally

466

had lower cognition compared to untreated patients (confounding by indication) and that their

467

progression was slightly delayed.

468

Biomarker-based disease staging

469

The final application of the model examined how a patient’s biomarker profile at study entry could be

470

used to predict their disease stage. Based on training data used for model development a set of 5

471

biomarkers were included in the model. Inclusion of biomarker profiles considerably improved

472

prediction of future ADAS-cog trajectories in the unseen validation dataset and inclusion of baseline

473

ADAS-cog score further improved the prediction. Among the biomarkers, FDG-PET explained most

474

variation followed by CSF Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 and Florbetapir SUVr. Hippocampal volume and plasma NfL

475

explained the least.

476

This modeling of baseline biomarkers for patients in the earliest stages of disease takes advantage of the

477

long-term follow-up that is unique to ADNI. The modeling essentially relies on hindsight because the

478

patients’ disease stage can only be predicted with high reliability once a systematic pattern of cognitive

479

decline has been observed. By using these patterns, the model identified how combinations of

480

biomarkers could be used to predict disease stage. The results of the model suggest that biomarker

481

profiles at a single time point may be used to predict the disease stage of an individual even in the

482

preclinical phases of disease where no clinically detectable cognitive impairment is present.

483

With further validation, these results can be used to define a space of permissible biomarker profiles to

484

use as inclusion criteria in clinical trials. Such biomarker-based synchronization of patient’s disease stage

485

would enable testing a drug in a more homogeneous population. This would in turn greatly increase the

486

power of clinical trials in AD where it is common to see extreme levels of variability in patient

487

trajectories [50,51].
