Abstract
Beta-lactam- and in particular carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae represent a major
public health threat. Despite strong variation of resistance across geographical settings, there
is limited understanding of the underlying drivers.
To assess these drivers, we developed a transmission model of cephalosporin- and
carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. The model is parameterized using antibiotic
consumption and demographic data from eleven European countries and fitted to the
resistance rates for Klebsiella pneumoniae for these settings. The impact of potential drivers
of resistance is then assessed in counterfactual analyses.
Based on reported consumption data, the model could simultaneously fit the prevalence of
extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
pneumoniae (ESBL and CRK) across eleven European countries over eleven years. The fit
could explain the large between-country variability of resistance in terms of consumption
patterns and fitted differences in hospital transmission rates. Based on this fit, a
counterfactual analysis found that reducing nosocomial transmission and antibiotic
consumption in the hospital had the strongest impact on ESBL and CRK prevalence.
Antibiotic consumption in the community also affected ESBL prevalence but its relative
impact was weaker than nosocomial consumption. Finally, we used the model to estimate a
moderate fitness cost of CRK and ESBL at the population level.
This work highlights the disproportionate role of antibiotic consumption in the hospital and
of nosocomial transmission for resistance in gram-negative bacteria at a European level. This
indicates that infection control and antibiotic stewardship measures should play a major role
in limiting resistance even at the national or regional level.

Significance Statement
As beta-lactam resistant gram-negative bacteria represent one of the most critical threats in
the ongoing antibiotic resistance crisis, it is crucial to identify the underlying drivers and
appropriate measures to curb their spread. By combining a transmission model with
epidemiological data at a European level, we can explain the strong differences of extendedspectrum beta-lactamase-producing and carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia across
countries and their often-rapid temporal increase. We find that among potentially modifiable
drivers, inpatient antibiotic consumption and nosocomial transmission rates have the
strongest impact on resistance. This implies that infection control and antibiotic stewardship
in hospitals are crucial for preventing antibiotic resistance in gram-negatives even beyond
individual hospitals as they may affect resistance prevalence at the level of entire countries.

Introduction
Beta-lactam resistant Enterobacteriaceae represent one of the most serious threats in the
current antimicrobial resistance crisis (1). Accordingly, carbapenem-resistant and extended
spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producing Enterobacteriaceae are examples mentioned by
the World Health Organization (WHO) in the last “Prioritization of Pathogens to Guide
Discovery” (1). Beta-lactams are a widely used type of antibiotics due to their broad
spectrum of activity against Gram-negative bacteria. Enterobacteriaceae are common
commensal flora, particularly in the gastrointestinal tract, and are typically exposed to any
antibiotic treatment administered to an individual. Hence, they have developed resistance to
most of the commonly used antibiotics. For example, carbapenem-resistant organisms (CRO)
are resistant to all known beta-lactams (2). Last-resort drugs, such as colistin, generally
remain effective, though there have already been reported cases of Enterobacteriaceae
resistant to both carbapenems and colistin (3). While newer drugs, such as ceftazidimeavibactam, have been introduced, widespread dissemination of carbapenem resistant genes
may herald the beginning of a post-antibiotic era (4), at least for the Enterobacteriaceae
species in question.
Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the leading causes of hospital-acquired infection (HAI), and
5-30% of the general population are colonized with it (5). In general, K. pneumoniae behaves
as commensal flora. Thus, exposure to antibiotics remains undetected, as antibiotic
prescription is rarely associated with infections. There are several studies that have found a
significant correlation between antibiotic use and the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in a
variety of pathogens (6–10). However, these correlations are usually far from perfect, e.g.
higher consumption does not always indicate more resistance when comparing countries,
indicating that other drivers may be at least as important as antibiotic consumption in
determining levels of antibiotic resistance(11).
In order to optimize prevention measures, it is critical to identify the drivers of resistance and
to understand how interventions targeting those drivers would translate into changes in
antibiotic resistance. Antimicrobial resistance is affected by a number of potential drivers
such as the consumption of antibiotics in the human population, consumption in livestock,
health care-related transmission, travel, and environmental contamination (11).One of the
most notable drivers of resistance is overall antibiotic consumption in humans (6–10).
However, antibiotic consumption in humans is not uniformly distributed, but is rather
characterized by strong heterogeneities imposed by demographics and the institutional setting
(11). One particularly relevant instance of this structure of antibiotic consumption are the
differences between the hospital and community settings, as per-capita consumption and
transmission rates tend to be higher in the hospital setting (5). The effects of population
structure (ranging from travel, to livestock, to institutional setting) are in principle detectable
by genomic and molecular epidemiology approaches (12–14). However, while such
approaches can help to characterize individual outbreaks, the high frequency of
asymptomatically colonized individuals and the fact that these individuals are typically not
sampled, implies that it is extremely challenging to obtain a representative assessment of the
overall importance of different settings with these methods. In this context, computational
models offer a unique opportunity to understand how antibiotic consumption, its distribution
by setting, and the transmission of pathogens in hospitals contribute to antibiotic resistance at
the population level.
Here, we aim to combine epidemiological models for the spread of resistance with
surveillance data on antibiotic consumption and resistance, in order to determine the key

driving factors of the spread of CROs and ESBL. We focused on rates of resistance for K.
pneumoniae, as it is one of the most common causes of bloodstream infections and hospitalacquired pneumonia (15), and mortality rates related to infection are high. The mortality of
bloodstream infection caused by carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRK) has been
estimated to be 50% (16).In addition, the epidemiology of this pathogen is well monitored by
the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) for several countries
(17),and resistance rates are highly variable across countries, with some countries exhibiting
low levels of 3rd generation cephalosporin resistance and almost no carbapenem resistance
(Denmark, Finland, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden), whereas in other countries carbapenem
resistance levels are above 20% (e.g. Greece, Italy). Antibiotic resistant K. pneumoniae
provides thus a good case study for understanding the variability and drivers of antibiotic
resistance.

Methods
Model
We used a deterministic compartmental model to simulate the spread of ESBL and CRK in
the hospital and the community. Our model has three principal dimensions: setting,
colonization, and treatment (see Figure 1 B): we stratified the population into hospital and
community settings to represent the difference in antibiotic consumption and transmission
between the two settings. All individuals were classified by colonization status into
susceptible, colonized (i.e. asymptomatic carriers of K. pneumonia), or infected (i.e. with
symptoms caused by K. pneumoniae). Colonized and infected individuals were also stratified
by strain as non-resistant, ESBL, and CRK. The susceptible and colonized compartments
could either be treated with 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins (drug A) or carbapenems (drug
B) or not treated at all. As most K. pneumoniae-colonized individuals who are exposed to
antibiotics are treated for unrelated illnesses, we assumed that this treatment is not affected
by colonization status and strain.
All infected individuals were assumed to be in the hospital setting. If an infection occurs in
the community, the individual was assumed to be hospitalized immediately upon the
development of symptoms. We further assumed that symptomatically infected individuals are
properly diagnosed and appropriately treated. This may be too optimistic, but it should be
noted that the number of symptomatically infected individuals is small (compared to the
colonized individuals) and hence their contribution to both consumption and transmission of
resistance is negligible. We introduced the symptomatically infected compartments to model
the sampling process, not for measuring their influence on consumption and transmission
(which is negligible). This was done, because all reported samples in ECDC data were
collected for bloodstream infections and spinal fluid infections.
Colonization can occur due to contact with colonized individuals and due to import from
external sources (which may reflect any process not explicitly captured in the model, for
example travel, agriculture etc.). In addition, we assumed resistance can spread due to supercolonization followed by horizontal gene transfer. By this process individuals colonized with
a sensitive strain can acquire resistance (this rate is however lower than primary colonization,
see Tables 1, S1, and S2 and the term HGT in the supplementary material equations). To
include import of colonized strains from other countries and from agriculture, we added a
constant extrinsic force of colonization as a free parameter to our model. Decolonization can
happen due to the treatment by antibiotics or due to natural clearance rates. The complete
description of the processes in the model and the model equations are available in the
Supplementary Material.

Fitting process
To calibrate the model and determine the free parameters such as fitness costs of resistance,
we fitted the model to the resistance data reported by the ECDC. This fit was done by
maximization of likelihood, assuming a binomially distribution of data (see supplementary
material section 2.1). We compared two main scenarios: in the first case, we assumed that
each country had a unique nosocomial transmission rate, while in the second case all
countries were assumed to have the same transmission rate. Based on these fits, we assessed
possible drivers of resistance by using counterfactual scenarios. Specifically, we considered
four potential drivers: nosocomial transmission rate, inpatient and outpatient consumption of
3rd and 4th generations cephalosporins, and inpatient consumption of carbapenems. Finally, to
evaluate the robustness of our results, we performed two types of sensitivity analyses: firstly,
a leave-one-out analysis, where we excluded one of the countries and fitted the model to the

remaining ten countries; and, secondly, variation of fixed parameters with high uncertainty
(colonization prevalence, time of treatment, time of clearance on treatment, mean length of
colonization, time of disease development in hospital) in a multivariable sensitivity analysis.

Data
We parametrized and calibrated the model using different types of data (see supplementary
material and in particular supplementary table S1, S2): consumption, hospitalization rate, and
length of hospitalization, which were obtained from surveillance data from the ECDC and
WHO. The biological and epidemiological parameters for which estimates were available
were extracted from the literature (supplementary table S1, S2).
We retrieved annual data on the prevalence of resistant bacterial strains and antibiotic
consumption from the ECDC. Data on resistance was collected through the European
Surveillance System (TESSy) by the ECDC, which includes data going back to 2005 for 30
countries (17). Consumption data covers the same time range and includes both hospital and
community consumption rates (18). Countries were included if they had both sufficiently
complete data for resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins and carbapenems and for use of
3rd and 4th generations cephalosporins and carbapenems from 2005 to 2015 (see flowchart on
Figure S4).
We assume resistance to 3rd generation to be a good proxy for the ESBL strain. In line with
ECDC reports, considering the fact that between 65.2% and 100% of 3rd generation
cephalosporin isolates are ESBL-positive, we assumed resistance to 3rd generation
cephalosporins to be a proxy for ESBL strains (19). We excluded countries that had less than
six out of ten annual records for antibiotic consumption in the hospital setting. Furthermore,
we excluded countries that had less than 18 resistance entries out of the 22 possible. Also, for
4 of them there are less than 18 resistance entries with the number of reported samples being
more than 200. As a result, we restricted our analysis to 11 countries (Croatia, Denmark,
Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden) with
sufficient data on both consumption and resistance (Figure S4).

Results
We combined a mathematical model for the transmission of ESBL and CRK with antibiotic
resistance and consumption data for 11 European countries in order to investigate the drivers
of resistance evolution (see Figure 1 and Methods and Supplementary material).
Qualitatively, the European countries considered here can be divided into three main groups
(Figure 3). The first group consists of countries with high prevalence of resistance to both 3rd
generation cephalosporins and carbapenems (Greece and Italy) (prevalence of carbapenem
resistance higher than 30% and prevalence of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins
higher than 50%). The second group consists of countries with high prevalence of resistance
to 3rd generation cephalosporins but low prevalence of resistance to carbapenems (Croatia,
France, Hungary, Portugal) (prevalence of carbapenem resistance less than 10% and
prevalence of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins higher than 30%). Finally, the third
group consists of countries with low prevalence of resistance to both (Denmark, Finland,
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden) (prevalence of carbapenem resistance less than 3% and
prevalence of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins less than 15%).
The correlation between the total (inpatient plus outpatient) consumption of 3rd and 4th
generation cephalosporins and the prevalence of resistance is weak (adjusted R2=0.27).
However, the corresponding correlation with inpatient consumption is stronger (R2=0.51)
(see Figure 2 A). As the consumption of carbapenems selects for the resistance to both
carbapenems and cephalosporins (because CRK are also resistant to cephalosporins), it is
reasonable to consider both 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins and carbapenems as drivers
for the spread of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins. Indeed, in this case the
correlation is even higher (R2=0.64). Finally, the strength of the correlation with consumption
rates can change considerably if the average yearly change of resistance is considered instead
of the prevalence of resistance (Figure S5). These different correlations provide a first
indication that the structure of antibiotic use (inpatient vs. outpatient), the consumption of
other antibiotics in the same class, and the dynamics of resistance should be taken into
account for understanding the association between antibiotic use and resistance. For
carbapenem resistance, the association between consumption and resistance prevalence is
even weaker (Figure 2 B). For example, both the Italian and Greek levels of carbapenem
consumption are comparable with other countries (Portugal, Hungary, Finland) which do not
exhibit a strong increase in CRK.
The eleven included countries exhibited qualitatively different time courses of resistance and
consumption (Figures S1-S3). We fit our model by varying among the free parameters only
hospital transmission rate across countries and keeping the other free parameters constant
across countries (see Table 1). This corresponds to the assumption that biological parameters
are comparable across countries, while transmission in the hospital, which depends on
nosocomial infection prevention, is setting specific. The model fit shows a considerable
variation in hospital transmission rates, which range from 1 times to 30 times the
corresponding rate in the community (Table 1). Overall, we find that this model can capture
both the dynamics within and the variability across the eleven European countries considered
(Figure 3).
We find that assuming one universal hospital transmission for all countries provides a
significantly worse fit of antibiotic resistance levels than the model allowing this rate to vary
across countries (Figure 3 and Table 1). Even though the model with a universal transmission

rate provides overall a qualitatively acceptable fit for most countries, it misses several
important features of the dynamics of resistance in the individual countries. Firstly, the model
fails to reproduce some of the extreme cases among very high and low prevalence countries.
For example, it could not capture the emergence of carbapenem resistance in Italy in 20102011 from near zero levels to over 30%, or the slight decrease of carbapenem resistance in
Norway (see Figure 3. Secondly, the fitted initial levels of resistance strongly differ in this
model for many countries (Greece, Italy Portugal) from the ECDC data, which again reflects
the model’s inability to capture extreme changes in antibiotic resistance.
By applying counterfactual scenarios, we found that nosocomial transmission and the
structure of antibiotic consumption played a key role as drivers of both carbapenem but also
ESBL strains. To determine the role of nosocomial transmission for the spread of ESBL and
CRK, we varied the corresponding inpatient transmission rate over a broad range (Figure 4).
We found that hospital transmission affected the level of resistance to carbapenems and also
the prevalence of ESBL strains (Figure 4). Despite this, in some countries such as Finland
and Norway, hospital transmission plays a minor role because it is low overall (see Figure 4
and Table 1). Nevertheless, the results indicate that hospital transmission is a major driver of
the spread of both ESBL and carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains. Concerning the
effect of the structure of antibiotic consumption, we found that antibiotic use in both the
hospital and community setting affects resistance, but that consumption in the hospital has a
stronger effect: even for ESBL, relative changes of the consumption of cephalosporins in
hospitals has overall a slightly stronger impact than of the outpatient consumption (Figure 5),
despite the fact that the absolute amount of 3rd and 4th generation cephalosporins consumed in
the community is considerably higher than that in the hospital (Figure S1 S2). This implies
that the effect of a given absolute amount of antibiotics (e.g. a given number of DDDs) is
larger if it is consumed in the hospital than if is consumed in the community. Our results also
show that carbapenem consumption could be a selective factor for the resistance to 3rd
generation cephalosporins (Figure 5) and that high consumption levels of 3rd generation
cephalosporins can affect the level of carbapenem resistance (Figure 5, for Italy). In addition,
import of resistance from other countries and agriculture could play a key role in the spread
of ESBL-strains in low-prevalent countries (Figure 6), despite the fact that the import rate is
low. Finally, we find also in the model assuming a uniform nosocomial transmission rate
across countries that transmission and consumption in hospitals are key drivers of resistance
and that import is mainly of importance for low-prevalence countries (Figures S6-S8).
We performed two types of sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of our results.
Firstly, a leave-one-out analysis assessed the dependence of our estimates on the inclusion of
individual countries (Figures S9 and S10). Secondly, we have performed a multivariate
sensitivity analysis simultaneously varying 5 parameters (colonization prevalence, time of
treatment, time of clearance on treatment, mean length of colonization, time of disease
development in hospital) within the ranges indicated in Table S2 (Figure S11). Overall, these
analyses showed that the above results were robust to both variation of fixed parameters and
removal of individual countries from the analyzed data set.

Discussion
The epidemic model presented here could explain the spread of carbapenem resistance and
ESBL strains over eleven years for eleven European countries with diverse resistance rates
and trajectories. In particular, we found that a good fit of the observed resistance data was
possible while only varying the hospital transmission rate but keeping the rest of the
parameters constant across countries. The model fit provided estimates of key unknown
parameters, in particular the fitness cost associated with antimicrobial resistance. Using
counterfactual scenarios, our results suggest that the hospital environment, both in terms of
transmission and antibiotic consumption, plays a key role for the spread of antimicrobial
resistance even at the level of entire countries.
Previous studies have shown for several pathogen-drug combinations significant correlations
between antibiotic consumption and the prevalence of resistance (6, 9, 20–22). However,
European data for K. pneumoniae exhibit no simple relationship between levels of
consumption and resistance. Using a dynamical modelling approach to link the history of
consumption and resistance allowed us to explain these apparent discrepancies, and to
provide a mechanistic explanation for the difference across countries and for the rapid
dynamics of resistance. In particular, we found two factors to be central: the structure of
antibiotic consumption (hospital vs. community) and nosocomial transmission of K.
pneumoniae:
Even though overall the majority of beta-lactams are consumed in the community, we found
that inpatient consumption may be a critical factor for the spread of resistance.
Specifically, our results indicate that a relative change of 3rd generation cephalosporins
consumption in the hospital has a similar or even higher impact than the same relative change
in the community (Figure 4). The absolute amount (in DDDs) of 3rd generation
Cephalosporins consumed in the hospital is however considerably lower than in the
community (Figure S1, S2). This implies that an absolute change in antibiotic consumption
(e.g. by a given number of DDDs) has a much higher impact if it occurs in the hospital than if
it occurs in the community. Intuitively, this can be explained by the fact that despite absolute
levels of antibiotic consumption being lower in the hospital, the relative consumption per
patient-time is higher than in the community (in terms of DDD per person-time). Thus, the
hospital setting can act as an environment where resistant strains have a selective benefit,
leading to a source-sink constellation (23) with the hospital representing the source and the
community the sink for resistance. Moreover, due to its higher transmission rate, the hospital
can turn into a hotspot of colonization with the resistant strain (especially in the highprevalence countries), explaining the disproportionate impact of antibiotic consumption we
observed in the counterfactual scenarios, where even for 3rd/4th generation cephalosporins,
consumption in the hospital had a much stronger impact on the corresponding resistance
evolution than consumption in the community. As a consequence, our findings also imply
that overall levels of antibiotic consumption may not be the optimal way to summarize the
impact of consumption on resistance. Instead, a DDD consumed in a high-transmission
setting may have a much stronger impact than a DDD consumed in a low-transmission
setting, implying that consumption rates should ideally be weighted or stratified by the
environment they are consumed in.
Similar to antibiotic consumption in the hospital, we found that nosocomial colonization rates
play an important role both in terms of the counterfactual scenarios considered and in terms
of explaining differences between countries. Again, this is consistent with the notion of the

hospital environment representing a hotspot for the transmission of antimicrobial resistance
even against drugs that are primarily consumed in the community. The high variability of
hospital transmission/colonization rates observed between countries can thus explain why
countries with similar levels of consumption exhibit different levels of resistance. In turn, this
variability of estimated transmission rates is expected to be affected by a range of factors
such as investment in hospital hygiene and infection control or hospital occupancy and
distribution patterns (number of patients per room, structure within hospitals etc.).
Our results suggest thus that both consumption and transmission rates in the hospital are
critical drivers for the spread of resistance (24). This indicates that investments in infection
control may not only benefit the individual hospital making those investments but can also
have an impact on the level of resistance at the country level. In line with (25), we found that
such collateral benefits are strongly dependent on the epidemiological setting. Hence, the
possibility of such collateral benefits are consistent with the success of several public health
interventions to reduce transmission in hospitals (26).The impact of the structure of the
consumption suggests that measures which would shift hospital consumption of antibiotics to
the community would give a benefit in terms of slowing down the spread of resistance (such
a shift could for example be achieved by outpatient intravenous antibiotic treatment).
Moreover, our results suggest that resistance to a particular antibiotic could depend on the
consumption of other antibiotics of the same class.
Considering the qualitative behavior of our model across countries, we found three main
types of possible settings: Firstly, countries with high prevalence of resistance and high
hospital transmission rates, which plays a dominant role in the spread of resistance. It is
notable that in some of these countries (in particular in Greece), hospital transmission rates
were estimated to be so high that the model predicts the spread of resistance to be almost
independent from antibiotic consumption rates. Secondly countries with medium prevalence,
where the spread is mostly driven by the antibiotic consumption and especially the antibiotic
consumption in hospitals. Thirdly, countries with low prevalence characterized by low
hospital transmission rates, where import of resistance is a key factor.
Finally, our model could also be used to estimate unknown parameters governing the spread
of resistance. One such key parameter determining the spread of resistance is the fitness cost
that resistant strains pay in the absence of antibiotic treatment. However, such fitness costs
are notoriously difficult to estimate. While it is possible to measure competitive differences
in vitro, the relevance of such measures for strain competition at the epidemiological level is
uncertain. The modelling approach presented here offers a possibility to obtain such fitness
cost estimates from the model fit. Intuitively, these estimates are the parameter values of the
fitness cost for which the observed levels of consumption would lead to the observed levels
of resistance. The estimated values (Table 1) indicated weak but non-negligible fitness costs,
which is consistent with in vitro estimates (27, 28).
Our model has several limitations and strengths. Like every model it is based on simplifying
assumptions which are mainly dictated by the (granular) availability of data and the
difficulties of parametrizing a more detailed model. For instance, we have not taken into
account any difference in colonization prevalence caused by climate or demographic
structure. Moreover, we were unable to control for differences in population structure, such
as age, gender, and other institutions such as long-term care facilities as data on consumption
and resistance at this level of detail was not available. Also, we used resistance to 3rd
generation cephalosporins as a proxy for ESBL strains and assumed that these strains are the

same across countries. An additional key limitation is the representativity of the resistance
and consumption data used for this analysis: Resistance data were available only for
bloodstream and spinal fluid infections. Moreover, consumption data were not complete for
all years, and the collection process differs from country to country and is based on two
different sources (reimbursement vs sale data) (29). However, we minimized the limitations
associated with the consumption and resistance data by carefully restricting our analysis to
countries with large numbers of isolates and consistent reporting over time. Moreover, the
limitations of our approach are counterbalanced by the strengths of our data-based our
modeling approach, which allows to provide a European perspective on the resistance
problem in gram negative bacteria: using an epidemiological model, we could explain the
variation and dynamics of antibiotic resistance in a key gram-negative pathogen at a
European level and identify the drivers of its transmission. In particular, our work highlights
the disproportionate role of antibiotic consumption in the hospital and of nosocomial
transmission for resistance in gram negative bacteria. This indicates that infection control and
antibiotic stewardship measures should play a major role in limiting resistance even at the
national or regional level.

Figure 3
Model fit of ESBL and CRK. The model was fitted to the data of the annual prevalence of
resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae reported by ECDC from 2005 to 2015. Circles represent
the reported data and solid and dotted lines represent the fit with variable between-country
and uniform for all hospital transmission rates respectively.
