Abstract

2

Forecasting the spatiotemporal spread of infectious diseases during an outbreak is an

3

important component of epidemic response. However, it remains challenging both

4

methodologically and with respect to data requirements as disease spread is influenced by

5

numerous factors, including the pathogen’s underlying transmission parameters and

6

epidemiological dynamics, social networks and population connectivity, and environmental

7

conditions. Here, using data from Sierra Leone we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of

8

recent cholera and Ebola outbreaks and compare and contrast the spread of these two

9

pathogens in the same population. We develop a simulation model of the spatial spread of an

10

epidemic in order to examine the impact of a pathogen’s incubation period on the dynamics of

11

spread and the predictability of outbreaks. We find that differences in the incubation period

12

alone can determine the limits of predictability for diseases with different natural history, both

13

empirically and in our simulations. Our results show that diseases with longer incubation

14

periods, such as Ebola, where infected individuals can travel further before becoming

15

infectious, result in more long-distance sparking events and less predictable disease

16

trajectories, as compared to the more predictable wave-like spread of diseases with shorter

17

incubation periods, such as cholera.

Significance statement

24

Understanding how infectious diseases spread is critical for preventing and containing

25

outbreaks. While advances have been made in forecasting epidemics, much is still unknown.

26

Here we show that the incubation period – the time between exposure to a pathogen and

27

onset of symptoms – is an important factor in predicting spatiotemporal spread of disease and

28

provides one explanation for the different trajectories of the recent Ebola and cholera

29

outbreaks in Sierra Leone. We find that outbreaks of pathogens with longer incubation periods,

30

such as Ebola, tend to have less predictable spread, whereas pathogens with shorter incubation

31

periods, such as cholera, spread in a more predictable, wavelike pattern. These findings have

32

implications for the scale and timing of reactive interventions, such as vaccination campaigns.

Introduction
Epidemics of emerging infectious diseases such as Ebola and Zika underscore the need

36

to improve global capacity for surveillance and response (1–3). Forecasting the spatiotemporal

37

spread of infectious diseases during an outbreak can enable responders to stay ahead of an

38

epidemic, but it remains challenging both methodologically and with respect to data

39

requirements. Disease spread is influenced by factors, including: the pathogen’s underlying

40

transmission parameters and epidemiological dynamics; social networks and population

41

connectivity; and environmental conditions (4–7). Previous forecasting efforts have had varying

42

levels of success in predicting the total number of cases and spatiotemporal spread of

43

outbreaks like Ebola, and few have actually been used in real time in the midst of an epidemic

44

(5). Efforts to understand the likely performance of forecasts have shown that heterogeneity in

45

contact structure and number of secondary infections can pose challenges, but reasonable

46

predictions can be made in some cases, depending on disease-specific parameters (4).

47

However, the epidemiological attributes that determine predictability remain poorly defined in

48

real-world settings.

49

The time taken for individuals to become infectious (the latent period) and symptomatic

50

(the incubation period) following infection, and the relationship between the two, have been

51

shown to play a large role in the epidemic potential of diseases (7–9). In particular, transmission

52

that occurs during the incubation period before an individual develops symptoms can

53

contribute to rapid disease spread. When the latent period is shorter than the incubation

54

period for an infectious individual, pre-symptomatic transmission can be a strong driver of the

55

total number of secondary infections by an infectious individual in a completely susceptible

56

population (i.e. R0) (8, 9). Indeed, the basis of contact tracing protocols during an outbreak

57

reflect the need to identify and contain individuals during the incubation period, and the

58

relative effectiveness of interventions such as symptom monitoring or quarantine significantly

59

depends on the relationship between infectiousness and symptoms (9). The incubation period

60

is also likely to play a particularly important role in determining the spatial spread of an

61

epidemic because one’s typical travel may continue prior to symptom onset, whereas travel

62

behavior may change or stop altogether during illness (10), particularly when symptoms are

63

severe or immobilizing.

64

Back-to-back epidemics of cholera (2012-2013) and Ebola (2014-2015) in Sierra Leone

65

present a unique opportunity to compare the spatial dynamics of two epidemics in the same

66

population caused by pathogens with notable similarities in both the drivers of outbreaks and

67

the interventions used to curtail them, including oral rehydration (11, 12). Both are transmitted

68

through contact with contaminated diarrhea or vomitus (plus other bodily fluids for Ebola), and

69

the reproductive number (R0) for both diseases is thought to be between 1 and 3 (13, 14). Both

70

diseases can cause immobilizing gastrointestinal symptoms of diarrhea and vomiting and,

71

untreated, their case fatality rates can exceed 50% (15, 16). Cultural factors and rituals, such as

72

traditional funeral practices, are known to influence the spread of both cholera (17) and Ebola

73

(18), while water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) programs are often used to slow the spread

74

of each (19). Both epidemics occurred against a backdrop of an immunologically naïve

75

population. Presumably, travel patterns and the density and distribution of people were

76

broadly similar over the time period in question. One critical difference between the dynamics

77

of these diseases, however, is the incubation period, which is estimated at a median of 8-12

78

days between infection and onset of symptoms for Ebola (1) and only 1-2 days for cholera (20).

79

We hypothesize that the disease incubation period may be a particularly influential

80

driver of different patterns of disease spread through space and time. We analyze the

81

spatiotemporal dynamics of a cholera outbreak and an Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone, both of

82

which occurred over a similar time period. We develop a simulation model of the spatial spread

83

of an epidemic and examine the impact of the incubation period on the dynamics of spread and

84

the predictability of outbreaks. We find that differences in the incubation period alone can

85

determine the limits of predictability for these diseases with different natural history, both

86

empirically and in our simulations. Our results show that diseases with longer incubation

87

periods, such as Ebola, where infected individuals can travel further before becoming

88

infectious, result in more long-distance sparking events and less predictable disease

Results
We first summarize the cholera and Ebola epidemics in terms of their dynamics in time

94

and space. More cases were reported during the cholera epidemic (22,691) than during the

95

Ebola epidemic (11,903); however, far fewer cholera cases were fatal (324 vs. 3,956). Both

96

epidemics lasted for similar periods of time, with cholera (January 7, 2012 – May 14, 2013)

97

occurring two years prior to Ebola (May 18, 2014 – September 12, 2015). The times between

98

the onset of an outbreak and when half or all of its cases were reported were longer when

99

outbreaks were aggregated by district instead of chiefdom (Figure 1), which has implications for

100

the optimal scale for surveillance and response measures. The median time for a chiefdom

101

cholera outbreak to report half its case total was 3.9 weeks, and median outbreak duration was

102

11.3 weeks. The median time for district outbreaks to report half their cholera cases was 7.9

103

weeks, and the median outbreak duration was 43.7 weeks. Analysis of Ebola revealed similar

104

trends, with chiefdoms reporting half of their cases at a median of 13.9 weeks and median

105

outbreak duration of 43.3 weeks, and districts reporting half of their cases at a median of 23.5

106

weeks and median outbreak duration of 64.1 weeks.

107

Both the cholera and Ebola epidemics were widespread, each reaching more than 75%

108

of the country’s chiefdoms. However, their trajectories differed. The spread of cholera from the

109

northwest followed a radial spatial dispersion gradually in all directions for the first six months,

110

while Ebola spread from the southeast for two months before rapid expansion to the northwest

111

which sparked the national epidemic (Figure 2 A-B). These findings were statistically supported

112

by space-time analysis of each epidemic, which revealed clusters of high case reporting of both

113

diseases in western Sierra Leone and unique clusters of cholera in the south and Ebola in the

114

east (Figure S1). The wave front of chiefdom cholera outbreak onset progressed more slowly

115

and gradually than for Ebola, which exhibited faster and more discontinuous expansion as

116

shown by the larger spacing between monthly contour lines (Figure 2 A-B). Despite their

117

different trajectories, the geography of the epidemics largely overlapped, with clusters of high

118

cumulative attack rates of cholera and Ebola observed in the north and west regions of Sierra

119

Leone (Figures 2 C-D) and confirmed through Local Moran’s I methods (Figure S2).

120

As a daily estimate of transmission intensity, we recorded the effective reproductive

121

number (Rt) and its variation over time nationally and by region (Figure 3). While some areas

122

sustained transmission (i.e., Rt > 1) of both cholera and Ebola for many days (e.g., Freetown in

123

the west and Kenema Town in the east), most chiefdoms recorded either zero cases or zero

124

days with Rt > 1 (Figure S3). As expected, transmission intensity of both diseases was positively

125

correlated in chiefdoms near each other (Figure S4). Correlation decayed with distance,

126

consistent with local disease spread, and inter-chiefdom distances of over 100km eliminated

127

any evidence of positive correlation of disease presence, chiefdom outbreak time, case count,

128

and cumulative attack rate (Figure S4). These metrics appear more highly correlated in space

129

for cholera than for Ebola, although the confidence intervals overlap.

132

Our simulations show a systematic relationship between the incubation period and

133

spatiotemporal patterns of disease spread. As expected, simulated epidemic curves of diseases

134

with shorter incubation periods were more acute while diseases with longer incubation periods

135

peaked later (Figure 4A). Although epidemics tend to last longer for diseases with longer

136

incubation periods, the spread of the disease to more distant locations can progress more

137

quickly, causing a discontinuous and more rapidly spreading wave front (Figure 4 C-D). In the

138

first 50 days of our simulations, locations further from the origin of the epidemic experienced

139

cases earlier on average in simulations with longer incubation periods compared to those with

140

shorter incubation periods, likely due to long-distance sparking events from infected agents

141

traveling during the incubation period (Figure 4B). The dispersion kernel Kx(d), the probability

142

that an agent will end up at a position separated a distance d from the initial position after x

143

days, is more homogeneously spread and has non-vanishing probabilities at greater distances

144

the higher the incubation period, explaining the enhancement in sparking events (Figure S5).

145

Simulations on a lattice with relative population size based on Sierra Leone’s chiefdom

146

census data support the finding that the duration of epidemics is longer on a district (i.e. group

147

of lattice points) rather than chiefdom (i.e. individual lattice point) scale, with duration

148

lengthening with increasing incubation periods (Figure 5A).

149

Consistent with the correlation analysis comparing Sierra Leone’s cholera and Ebola

150

outbreaks, time series from simulated outbreaks with shorter incubation periods were more

151

highly correlated than those from simulations with longer incubation periods, with correlation

152

decaying as distance between locations on the lattice increased (Figure 5 B-C). Higher

153

correlation suggests increased predictability, which the results of the overlap function support

(Figure 6). As the incubation period lengthened, the average predictability during the beginning

155

of the outbreak decreased as the epidemics spread via unpredictable sparking patterns.

156

Predictability plateaued as the outbreaks became widespread.

157

159

Discussion
Analysis of the cholera and Ebola epidemics revealed commonalities and differences in

160

the way these pathogens spread throughout Sierra Leone, and our simulations suggest the

161

differences in the incubation period reproduce these differences. Spatial diffusion of Ebola

162

occurred more quickly than cholera, as evidenced by the wave front contour lines and further

163

supported by statistical tests considering a subset excluding cholera cases before the brief

164

respite in June (Figure S6). Additionally, cholera metrics were more correlated in space than

165

Ebola metrics. Our model simulations suggest that these findings are potentially due to the

166

counter-intuitive role of the longer incubation period for Ebola as compared to cholera. Travel

167

during the incubation period will be a key driver of geographic disease dispersion and

168

predictability, especially in a population of individuals who decrease mobility when ill.

169

Consequently, diseases with longer incubation periods will tend to have more long-distance

170

sparking events caused by infected, but healthy, individuals traveling during the incubation

171

period. This will result in faster epidemic dispersion to distant, unpredictable locations. These

172

findings are in line with Marvel et al.’s results, which found epidemic wave fronts are less likely

173

to occur for mobility kernels that decay more slowly (21); when the incubation period is longer,

174

the effective kernel can span to more distant places, making sparking events more probable.

175

Similar results were also obtained when infectious agents did not decrease mobility

176

when ill, suggesting that travel during the incubation period has more influence on correlation

177

and predictability than travel during the infectious period. While many other factors will

178

influence wave speed, continuity, and epidemic synchrony, our simulations showed that small

179

changes in the incubation period can powerfully influence epidemic dynamics.

180

The incubation period has already been recognized as an important component for

181

understanding epidemics and control (8), with the conventional knowledge that long incubation

182

periods allow more time for responders to scale-up interventions against the overall epidemic

183

and are therefore advantageous for disease control efforts. Here we demonstrated a counter-

184

intuitive mechanism whereby a longer incubation period may in fact hinder a response by

185

decreasing the predictability of outbreaks and increasing their geographic scope as well as of

186

the needs of surveillance and response. We use simulations to reproduce the double-edged

187

sword of the influence of the disease incubation period on reactive interventions.

188

Reactive vaccination strategies exist for both cholera and Ebola outbreaks, and a better

189

understanding of spatiotemporal spread can facilitate locally-preemptive vaccination to target

190

locations at high risk of introduction (22–24). Reactive vaccination campaigns must consider

191

both the expected duration of an outbreak at a given spatial scale and the predictability of its

192

spread. For cholera, we showed that chiefdom outbreaks tended to report half their cases

193

within approximately 4 weeks, suggesting reactive vaccination of a chiefdom triggered by

194

detection of a case may not be early enough to avert an outbreak and instead intervening at a

195

wider scale, such as districts, might provide more favorable timing for intervention targeting.

196

We posit for future study that regional-ring vaccination strategies may be better suited to

197

diseases with short incubation periods, while contact-ring vaccination strategies may be better

198

suited to diseases with longer incubation periods due to their regional unpredictability and the

199

longer intervals between generations in infection.

200

There are limitations to our work with regards to data as well as methods. Few cholera

201

cases were confirmed during the epidemic and therefore we depend on the clinical definition as

202

well as the cases that were detected and recorded by the surveillance system. Ebola

203

surveillance data is similarly prone to differences in reporting rates, but the use of only

204

confirmed cases yielded similar results. Our estimates for the effective reproductive number

205

depend on, and absorb the limitations of, case data, serial interval estimates, and the chiefdom

206

connectivity matrix. Specifically, we assume all cases in our dataset acquired infection from

207

others in the dataset, thereby excluding missing cases and asymptomatic transmitters.

208

However, this method has been shown to be robust to cases missing at random and we

209

furthermore expect the role of asymptomatic transmission to be limited for both diseases due

210

to the strong correlation between pathogen load, symptoms, and infectiousness (25, 26).

211

Further, we assume no changes to the serial interval for either cholera or Ebola during

212

the course of the epidemics. For cholera specifically, waterborne transmission could potentially

213

lead to a heavy right-tail in serial intervals or change the distribution as pathogen accumulates

214

or clears from a drinking source. Household data in Bangladesh, where the role of water

215

contamination is expected to be large, suggest few serial intervals beyond 7 days (27). The

216

geographic spread of cholera in Sierra Leone from the northwest and south towards the center

217

of the country was not consistent with the direction of key waterways in the country, which

218

primarily run from the eastern highlands to the western shores, suggesting population density

219

and human-to-human contact likely played a larger role than water sources in this outbreak.

220

Finally, our simulation model provides a proof-of-concept test of the hypothesis of the

221

impact of the incubation period on disease spread and makes several simplifying assumptions.

222

These assumptions could be relaxed in future work, including the complete overlap of

223

symptoms and infectiousness and constant diffusion of agents without increased probability of

224

returning “home.” Other models for connectivity and movement could also be explored.

225

The threat of cholera and Ebola re-emergence in Sierra Leone remains a concern (28).

226

We have shown that differences in incubation period alone are a powerful driver of geographic

227

dispersion and merit further study. Although this study only examines one epidemic from each

228

disease, the size of these epidemics, combined with simulation results from our model, can

229

lend information towards a better understanding of each disease and our ability to predict

230

disease spread. This work can inform development of international preparedness and response

231

strategies and ensure timely and effective interventions.

240

without a known cholera outbreak; once the Government of Sierra Leone declared an outbreak

241

of cholera on February 27, 2012, any case of acute watery diarrhea could henceforth be

242

included as a suspected cholera case. Data were compiled and anonymized by the WHO for

243

analysis, with case reports temporally resolved by day and spatially resolved by chiefdom. For

244

Ebola, we used a published dataset of 8,358 confirmed and 3,545 suspected Ebola cases

245

reported to the Sierra Leone Ministry of Health and Sanitation from May 2014 to September

246

2015 (30). Our analysis included both suspected and confirmed cases of Ebola according to

247

standard WHO definitions (31). Population estimates for 2012 and 2014 were imputed by

248

chiefdom using a linear fit between chiefdom population estimates from the 2004 and 2015

249

Population and Housing Censuses (32).

250

Sierra Leone has four administrative regions, which are divided into fourteen districts.

251

Freetown, the capital and largest city, is comprised of two districts; the remaining twelve

252

districts are subdivided into 149 chiefdoms, with a median of 11.5 chiefdoms per district.

253

Chiefdom, as the finest administrative unit available for cases of both cholera and Ebola, was

254

considered the unit of observation and the unit of analysis (with the exception of cases in

255

Freetown which were solely reported at district level), as it is the likely scale of intervention

256

campaigns like vaccination. To understand what would have been observed at a coarser spatial

257

scale that is more common for surveillance, we additionally aggregated cases by district.

front direction and speed (30). Contours of spatial spread were generated using ArcMap 10.3.1

263

Spatial Analyst extension by applying a fourth degree polynomial trend interpolation of

264

chiefdom onset dates and generating contour lines of this surface in 2–4 week increments.

265

With this method, more closely-spaced contour lines indicate slower propagation, similar to the

266

slope of a topographic map of geographic elevation.

267

To identify space-time clusters, using the SaTScan software package (33), we ran a

268

retrospective discrete Poisson-based Scan Statistic over the entirety of the outbreaks for which

269

data were available, namely 16 months of cholera data and 17 months of Ebola data. Disease

270

case reports were assumed to be Poisson-distributed given chiefdom population size. The unit

271

of time aggregation for the analysis was specified as the median incubation periods for each

272

disease (1.5 days for cholera and 10 days for Ebola).

273

We calculated spline correlograms for four chiefdom outbreak metrics to measure

274

spatial correlation of date of first case, case count, attack rate, and disease presence (yes/no).

275

The maximum centroid-to-centroid distance was set to 150 km, approximately the radius of

276

Sierra Leone. We used the spline.correlog function of the R package ncf for each disease and all

277

chiefdom pairs (34).

278

We estimated the daily effective reproductive number (Rt), the average number of

279

onward infections generated by cases with onset on day t, using methods described by

280

Wallinga and Teunis and extended to metapopulations by White et al. (35, 36). This maximum

281

likelihood method estimates the probability that an observed case was the infector for each

282

subsequent case by leveraging information on the daily case count, the serial interval

283

distribution (i.e., the time between symptom onset of an infector-infectee pair), and a weights

284

matrix that quantifies relative contact frequency within and between chiefdoms. The serial

285

interval for cholera was assumed to follow a gamma distribution (rate = 0.1, shape = 0.5) with a

286

median of five days, as has been used previously after consideration of both fast, person-to-

287

person, and slow, environmental, transmission routes (37, 38). The serial interval for Ebola was

288

assumed to follow a gamma distribution (rate = 0.17, shape = 2.59) with a median of 13.3 days

289

derived from the estimates by the WHO Ebola Response Team (1). The contact frequency

290

between two given chiefdoms was assumed to decrease with squared distance between the

291

chiefdom centroids. Additional weights matrices with different functional forms for distance

292

decay yielded qualitatively similar measurements of Rt.

294
295

Model
We simulated an agent-based model with 45,000 agents distributed equally in 150

296

locations, evenly spaced on a 15 x 10 lattice. Infected agents progressed through a traditional

297

Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) compartmental transmission framework. We

298

assumed the incubation period (i.e. the time from exposure to symptom onset) overlapped

299

completely with the latent period (i.e. the time from exposure to onset of infectiousness).

300

Similarly, the duration of illnesses (5 days) aligned with the duration of infectiousness.

301

Movement of agents between two locations was based on a gravity model, whereby

302

connectivity was proportional to the population sizes of each location and the inverse squared

303

distance between them (39). Different parametrizations of the gravity model, as well as

304

simulations with relative population size based on Sierra Leone’s chiefdom census data (40),

305

yielded similar results.

306

Susceptible, exposed, and recovered individuals had a daily probability of movement. To

307

simulate the impact of a reduction in mobility during illness, agents in the model had their

308

movement reduced as far as zero throughout the course of their period of infectiousness (and,

309

equivalently, illness). Holding all other parameters constant, we conducted 700 simulations of

310

epidemics for incubation periods ranging from 1 to 14 days. We seeded the epidemic at the

311

same location near the center of the lattice for all simulations.

312

Synchrony was assessed with the R package ncf functions mSynch and Correlog.Nc (34),

313

which both estimate the correlation between the time series in each of the 150 locations across

314

the 500 days of the simulations, with the latter incorporating distance (34). which both

315

estimate the correlation between the time series in each of the 150 locations across the 500

316

days of the simulations, with the latter incorporating distance. To assess the impact of the

317

incubation period on the initial speed of spread, we calculated the average start time across all

318

locations in the first 50 days of the outbreaks as well as at increasing distances from the

319

location on the lattice where the outbreaks began.

320

To estimate the predictability of outbreak spread in space and time, we adapted an

321

overlap function used to measure predictability of a SARS outbreak (7). In each simulation, a

322

vector 𝜋" (𝑡) represents the proportion of all infected individuals at time (t) who are at location

323

(j). In a system with high predictability, 𝜋" (𝑡) will be similar across simulations. The overlap

324

between simulations I and II can be estimated by: Θ(t) = ∑" '𝜋"( (𝑡) ∗ 𝜋"(( (𝑡). Θ(t) ranges from 0

325

to 1 with a higher value indicating more overlap and thus more predictability. We estimated

326

predictability at each time point by calculating the average of the overlap functions for each

327

pair of simulations for each incubation period. We calculated the average overlap across time

429

Figure 1. The proportion of cholera and Ebola cases reported over time differed between

430

district and chiefdom level. The times between the onset of an outbreak and when half or all of

431

its cases were reported were longer when outbreaks were aggregated by district instead of

432

chiefdom, which has implications for the optimal scale for surveillance and response measures.

433

The median time for a chiefdom cholera outbreak to report half its case total was 3.9 weeks

434

and a median of 7.9 weeks for district cholera outbreaks. For Ebola, chiefdoms reported half of

435

their cases at a median of 13.9 weeks and districts at a median of 23.5 weeks.

436
437

Figure 2. Spatial trend contours of disease spread and chiefdom attack rates highlight

438

similarities and differences between the two epidemics. Spatial trend contours of cholera (A)

439

and Ebola (B) spread from areas in dark red to light red; thicker lines (A & B) show monthly

440

increments and thinner lines (B) show 2 week increments. Thick black lines denote regions and

441

thin black lines denote districts. Chiefdom attack rate quartile for cholera (C) and Ebola (D) vary

442

over space and regions. Colored boundaries denote regions, followed by bold black borders for

443

districts and thin borders for chiefdoms.

respectively. Black lines show maximum likelihood estimates of Rt of cholera and Ebola

448

epidemics nationally (A and B, respectively) and in each region (C and D, respectively).

450

Figure 4. Results of 700 simulations of 14 different incubation periods show the impact of

451

incubation period on disease spread. Epidemics with shorter incubation periods are more acute

452

than epidemics with longer incubation periods (A). The average start time of epidemics at all

453

locations over the first 50 days of outbreak is later for shorter incubation periods than longer

454

(B). Spatial trend contours of first 50 days of simulated outbreaks with shorter incubation

455

period (2 days) (C) and longer incubation period (10 days) (D), spreading from areas in dark red

456

to light red, show that shorter incubation periods result in a more wave front spread and longer

457

incubation periods result in more long-distance sparking events; numbers show average start

458

day relative to start of the outbreak.

459
460

Figure 5. The incubation period impacts the timing of outbreaks and as a result, the correlation.

461

As the incubation period increases, the proportion of cases reported by 10 weeks, when a

462

reactive vaccination campaign might begin, decreases in simulated epidemics (A). As the

463

incubation period increases, the average correlation overall (B) and by distance from origin of

464

simulated outbreaks (C) decreases.

465
466

Figure 6. The incubation period impacts the predictability of disease spread. As the incubation

467

period increases, the average overlap (predictability) of the first 50 days (A) and over the first

468

50 days (B) of simulated outbreaks decreases.
