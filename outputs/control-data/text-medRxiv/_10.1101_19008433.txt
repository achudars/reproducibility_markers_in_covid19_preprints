ABSTRACT

34

Health workers in low-resource settings often lack the support and tools to follow evidence-based

35

clinical recommendations for diagnosing, treating and managing sick patients. Digital technologies,

36

by combining patient health information and point of care diagnostics with evidence-based clinical

37

protocols, can help improve the quality of care, the rational use of resources (humans, diagnostics

38

and medicines) and save patient lives. The development of a target product profile for electronic

39

clinical decision support algorithms (CDSAs) aimed at guiding preventive or curative consultations,

40

and that integrate diagnostic test results will help align developer and implementer processes and

41

specifications with the needs of end-users, in terms of quality, safety, performance and operational

42

functionality. To identify characteristics for a CDSA, experts from academia, research institutions,

43

and industry as well as policy makers with expertise in diagnostic and CDSA development, and

44

implementation in LMICs were convened. Experts discussed the critical characteristics of a draft TPP

45

which was revised and finalised through a Delphi process to facilitate consensus building. Experts

46

were in overwhelming agreement that, given that CDSAs provide patients’ management

47

recommendations, the underlying clinical algorithms should be available in human readable format

48

and evidence-based. Whenever possible, the algorithm output should take into account pre-test

49

disease probabilities, diagnostic likelihood ratios of clinical or laboratory predictors and disease

50

probability thresholds to test and to treat. Validation processes should at a minimum ensure the

51

CDSA are implementing faithfully the evidence-based algorithm they are based on (internal

52

validation through clinical association and analytical validation). Additionally, clinical validation,

53

bringing practice evidence about the impact of the CDSA use on health outcomes, was recognized as

54

a good to have. The CDSAs should be designed to fit within clinic workflows, connectivity challenges

55

and high volume settings. Data collected through the tool should conform to local patient privacy

56

regulations and international data standards.

INTRODUCTION

59

Health workers at primary health care (PHC) have the greatest challenge in ensuring appropriate

60

care for their communities. One way to support health workers is through the provision of clinical

61

guidance in the form of clinical practice guidelines or clinical decision support algorithms (CDSA).

62

Clinical practice guidelines are a set of recommendations on diagnostic and treatment modalities

63

based on systematic review of evidence and assessment of the benefits and harms for the patients.

64

The World Health Organisation (WHO) developed several simple clinical decision guidelines to

65

support health workers in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in the evaluation and

66

management of clinical problems, with the ultimate goal of improving quality of care[1]. This

67

includes the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) designed in the 1990s for common

68

diseases affecting children younger than 5 years of age[2], which was later adapted for use at the

69

community as the integrated Community Case Management guideline (iCCM)[3]. Other guidelines

70

have been developed and either take an integrated management approach similar to IMCI, such as

71

the Integrated Management of Adolescent and Adult Illness (IMAI[4]), or a disease-specific approach

72

(i.e. WHO’s dengue guidelines for diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control[5]).

73

While the global health community awaits updated and more comprehensive clinical algorithms, the

74

Fourth Industrial Revolution[6] is seeing developing economies “leapfrogging”[7] mobile

75

technologies across multiple sectors and including for health. As a result, a plethora of digital clinical

76

decision support systems (CDSS) have been implemented in LMICs. CDSS are defined as “digitised

77

job aids that combine individual’s health information with the health worker’s knowledge and

78

clinical protocols to assists health workers in making diagnosis and treatment decisions”[8]. It is well

79

recognized that adherence to standardized clinical practice guidelines is a measurement of quality of

80

care[9,10], and that improving adherence to evidence-based guidelines is associated with better

81

health outcomes[11]. By digitalizing clinical guidelines such as IMCI and iCCM, into electronic CDSAs

82

in its simplest form, a decision tree, several groups have shown significant increase in health worker

83

adherence to guidelines compared to routine care (paper-based IMCI)[12, 13,14].

84

However, based on IMCI/iCCM, today these CDSAs carry the same limitations than the main

85

guidelines, and still lack point of care (POC) diagnostic tests that could improve the accuracy of

86

diagnoses and treatment recommendations. The only diagnostic test widely used with IMCI/iCCM

87

guidelines is a malaria rapid diagnostic test (mRDT) and while this inclusion was important in the

88

context of “test-and-treat”[15], it is limited to ruling in or out one pathogen alone. Acute febrile

89

illness can be caused by bacterial or viral respiratory infections, or seasonal, geographically localised

90

pathogens, like dengue. Hence, the inclusion of additional simple wet and digital diagnostics into

91

adapted algorithms can reduce antimicrobial over-prescriptions as well as patient outcome[16, 17].

92

With the growing development of CDSAs, especially related to the management of sick children in

93

LMICs (Supplemental File 1), it is important to ensure that new tools meet the needs of the end-user

94

and take into consideration the emerging landscape of diagnostic tools that might be included in

95

new algorithms forming a toolkit consisting of CDSA and diagnostics.

96

The aim of this work was to define a target product profile (TPP) to inform developers and

97

implementers alike of the requirements for CDSAs aimed at guiding health workers during a

98

preventive or curative consultation with any type of patient, and that have the ability to incorporate

99

diagnostic test results, especially when diagnostics tests have been implemented in pre-existing

100

guidelines.

1. METHODS

103
104

1.1. Draft Target Product Profile

105

A draft TPP (version 0) for CDSAs combined with POC test results was developed (by: KP, SD, RS, ZK,

106

GLM, FM) based on standard procedure at FIND and WHO, where characteristics are defined as

107

“minimal” and “optimal” criteria (Supplemental File 2). “Minimal” is used to refer to the lowest

108

acceptable output for a characteristic and “optimal” for the ideal target of a characteristic.

109

Comments are used to explain or provide examples for the characteristics. As this TPP is for a multi-

110

component toolkit, CDSA and POC diagnostics, the structure of the TPP was adapted to cover the

111

different components and for the purpose of clarity. These sections included: Scope General, Scope

112

Toolkit, Electronic Clinical Decision Algorithm, Point of Care Tools, App, Data and Procurement.

113
114

1.2. Expert Meeting

115

To discuss selected aspects of the draft TPP (algorithm validation, performance, machine learning,

116

diagnostic data, disease prediction, clinical workflow and application functionality) (Supplemental

117

File 2), a meeting on this subject was convened by FIND and WHO involving 39 experts from

118

academic institutions, industry, private and public sectors from 11 countries[18]. Experts were

119

selected based on their experience in relevant areas of work directly related to digital health (clinical

120

decision support or other digital tools targeting resource-challenges settings) and/or diagnostics

121

(wet and digital). Following the expert meeting the TPP was updated based on expert feedback

122

(version 1.0) (Supplemental File 3).

123
124

1.3. Delphi Process

125

To facilitate consensus building for the TPP, we followed a Delphi-like process where the TPP version

126

1.0 was reviewed. For this, a three- part online survey was developed. The first part of the survey

127

collected professional information for survey respondents as well as experience with clinical

128

practice/research, diagnostic development, software development, implementation of healthcare

129

programs in LMICs, and health information systems. The second part of the survey allowed for

130

rating of both minimal and optimal criteria for all TPP characteristics. Agreement was scored on a

131

Likert scale from 1- 5, where 1 corresponds to fully disagree, 2-mostly disagree, 3-neither agree nor

132

disagree, 4-mostly agree and 5- fully agree. Disagreement with a criterion was based on a rating

133

from 1 to 3 and required a comment/suggestions by the survey respondent. To reach consensus,

134

more than 75% of survey respondents should provide a rating of at least 4 (agreement) on the Likert

135

scale. The third part of the survey provided an opportunity for respondents to share

136

comments/feedback/ideas on the TPP if not covered in the characteristics section. The survey was

137

developed with the online software SurveyGizmo (SurveyGizmo LLC, Boulder CO, USA). Survey

138

analyses were performed using Microsoft Excel 2013 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA).

RESULTS

144

1. Expert Consensus on the Target Product Profile through a Delphi Process

145

In the first round, the online survey was sent to 77 experts (including workshop participants) and 28

146

responded to the survey (response rate, 36.4%), with some respondents submitting a coordinated

147

response for their institution. Twenty-five percent of respondents were from LMICs (7/28), however

148

the majority of respondents, (22/28, 78%), had experience working in Africa and 57% (16/28) in

149

South East Asia. More than 85% of respondents (24/28) had more than 5 years of experience in

150

clinical practice and research, 50% (14/28) in health programme implementation in LMICs, 39%

151

(11/28) in health information systems, 21% (6/28) in software development and 14% (4/28) in

152

diagnostic product development (Supplemental File 4). Most participants work in international

153

organizations (7/28, 25%) and academic institutions (10/28, 35.7%). In the first round, at least 50%

154

agreement was reached for all criteria for all characteristics and feedback was taken into

155

consideration to develop TPP version 1.1 for the second round of the Delphi survey (Supplemental

156

File 5). In this new version, the characteristic “Encounter” was removed as several participants

157

expressed it was redundant with the characteristic “Workflow”. Therefore version 1.1 had 40

158

characteristics.

159

A second online survey was sent to the 28 respondents from round 1. In this round, 23 participants

160

responded to the survey (response rate, 82%). Most participants were from academia (7/23, 30%),

161

non-profit international organizations (7/23, 30%) and had a similar profile than respondents from

162

round 1 (Supplemental File 4 ). In this round of review, at least 75% of participants agreed with the

163

minimal and optimal criteria for all TPP characteristics. On average, 91% of survey respondents

164

agreed with the minimal and optimal criteria (Figure 1) and the TPP was finalized (version 2).

Scope General and Scope Toolkit Components. This TPP defines a toolkit composed of CDSAs and

169

POC diagnostics intended to support evidence-based clinical decisions taken by health workers

170

during a preventive or curative consultation, by capturing patient clinical and context-specific data,

171

as well as diagnostic test results to provide recommendations on diagnosis and patient management

172

(including preventive & curative treatment, counseling, etc.). The clinical algorithm integrates POC

173

diagnostic results and is embedded in an App. POC diagnostics in this toolkit should be regulatory

174

approved for use in the setting of implementation.

175

The experts agreed that the CDSA should first define its target i.e. i) patients (e.g. age group), ii)

176

medical problems (e.g. syndrome or disease), iii) end users (e.g. minimally trained health worker or

177

trained clinician) and iv) level of care (e.g. community or health facility) for which the clinical

178

recommendations are meant and relevant. These specifications should be clearly communicated to

179

the end-user at the beginning of the algorithm. The health worker should immediately be warned if

180

information she or he enters in the system does not fit with these specifications. In cases where an

181

App proposes different algorithms for different use cases (i.e. antenatal care, management of

182

childhood illness), the specifications shall be clearly available for each individual algorithm (Table 1).

186

Clinical Decision Support Algorithms. Regarding the algorithm medical content, the working group

187

agreed that it must be evidence-based. Whether newly developed or adapted from existing

188

guidelines, the algorithm medical content should be developed following international standards for

189

the development or adaptation of evidence-based clinical guidelines, to ensure it implements the

190

best available evidence. This evidence can originate from well-established clinical guidelines such as

191

WHO/international/local clinical care guidelines, or from peer-reviewed articles, clinical practice

192

and/or validation research and the level of evidence and the strength of recommendations in the

193

target context should ideally be communicated. In line with this, recommendations should cause the

194

least harm to the patient and to the community. For example, algorithms related to treatment and

195

management of patient suffering from infectious diseases should also support antimicrobial

196

stewardship to avoid unnecessary side effects for the patient and the development of resistance in

197

the community and at global level. In addition, the algorithm should be validated both analytically

198

and semantically to ensure that the algorithm output is accurate and reproducible, doesn’t deviate

199

from expert content/evidence and that there are no interactions or conflicts in the logic.

200

Further, important characteristics were content quality, machine learning (ML). With the rise of ML

201

also in this domain of CDSAs to analyse the data captured through algorithms and then for example

202

augment algorithm diagnostic or prognostic accuracy, workshop experts thought it important to

203

address this in the TPP. It was agreed that an algorithm that recommends treatment decisions and

204

management of patients should be at a minimum human interpretable, meaning one should

205

understand how input data are processed into output data. Changes to the algorithm logic based on

206

ML analyses should also be validated (Table 2).

Point of Care Tools. Experts agreed that the post-test probability or the likelihood of a disease being

211

present, should be assessed based on the pre-test probability—the prevalence of the disease in the

212

corresponding patient population—and the diagnostic positive/negative likelihood ratio—how good

213

a test predicts the presence or absence of disease—of all clinical information i.e. signs, symptoms,

214

and POC diagnostic test results (Table 2). Clinical diagnosis often lacks accuracy and therefore

215

diagnostic tests that have the proven added value for patient management should be integrated

216

within algorithms. These tests can be wet diagnostics such as pathogen-specific RDTs or hand-held

217

devices such as haemoglobinometers, and do not exclude digital diagnostics such as digital

218

thermometers.

219
220

App. An important characteristic in this section is System Validation. Today, there is no standard

221

process to validate and assess performance accuracy of CDSAs. There is also a severe lack of

222

evidence and peer-reviewed publications on both the development and the performance of these

223

tools in LMICs. While some groups have performed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to measure

224

patient outcome and other parameters that impact patient health, such as the reduction of

225

antibiotic over-prescription[16, 17], others have assessed the performance of their tool

226

measuring health worker adherence to guidelines[12,13,14]. The level of validation ultimately

227

depends on the type of algorithm. The USFDA has provided some guidance to developers and

228

implementers on the kind of evidence that needs to be provided[19]. The TPP criteria are inspired by

229

this guidance. The minimal criteria guarantee that the App has a CDSA that is based on evidence

230

(clinical association) and that input data is processed correctly (analytical validation). The optimal

231

criteria include clinical validation in addition to clinical association and analytical validation. Through

232

clinical validation, the App has been assessed for the intended outcome (i.e. improved clinical

233

outcome, better quality of care, rational use of resources and reduction of antibiotic over-

234

prescription, etc.) (Table 3).

238

In May 2017, a new regulation (EU 2017/745) on medical devices, to which CDSA pertain by

239

definition[20] was adopted by the European Commission, that will be applied starting spring

240

2020[21]. This regulation includes a reinforcement of the rules on the clinical evidence that should

241

be provided by developers and manufacturers, at least if based in Europe. While waiting for LMICs to

242

have their own regulations, this new regulation will certainly impact development and validation by

243

European developers.

244

Experts also called for Application Programming Interface (API) to allow other software to ‘talk to’

245

and interact with the tool through commonly known programming languages. The App should be

246

protected by authorisation and authentication that as a minimum requirement adhere to usual

247

technical standards, and optimally would adhere to HIE (Health Information Exchange) and/or

248

Health Level 7 International[22] medical standards. It was noted that adherence to HL7 can be

249

expensive, hence this was proposed as an optimal rather than a minimal requirement. The App

250

should also be designed to integrate with patient care pathways and health worker workflows with

251

limited disruption. The CDSA accordingly has pause and resume capability to allow time for

252

diagnostic tests to be performed and results entered in the algorithm. POC diagnostic tests such as

253

mRDTs can require up to 20 min for results to be read, depending on the manufacturer.

254
255

Data

. Digital tools have the potential to amass enormous amount of data. With CDSA, patient

256

personal data is captured, stored and potentially used for other operational (i.e. supply chain

257

management) and algorithm development purposes. Many countries have personal data privacy and

258

protection laws in place to protect citizens from the abuse of their personal information. In the

259

European Union this is known as the General Data Protection Regulation[23]. However, there are

260

still many countries around the world that do not have a national eHealth strategy or personal data

261

legislation. This called for the need to address personal data handling with CDSA for security and

262

accountability purposes. Experts agreed that the implementer, who would be considered as the data

263

controller, is responsible for the data and should comply with local data policies and legislations. No

264

specific legislation was mentioned as these differ by country and region. In addition, the historic of

265

the processes that are applied to data as well as the origin of data should be documented (Data

sensitive data, and mitigate cyber-attacks, whether data is at rest or in transmission (Table 4).

DISCUSSION

272
273

In this work, our aim was to develop a TPP to enable the development of a toolkit that includes

274

CDSAs that are based on evidence and designed to integrate results of diagnostics performed at POC

275

to guide rational clinical decisions. The use of such toolkit would aid in strengthening healthcare

276

particularly at the community and primary care echelons, and help address health workers

277

difficulties to differentiate diseases and syndromes without diagnostic tests and the aid of

278

formalised diagnostic processes that can be provided through algorithms.

279

In terms of TPP characteristics, “Data” and “Validation” emerged as key topics of discussion. Data

280

generated from CDSA require storage and connectivity and are therefore vulnerable to abuse, loss or

281

unlawful purposes. Although many countries have enacted personal data protection legislation,

282

many fall short on enforcing these and others are still drafting bills. For example, in the African

283

region, in 2017, 17 (out of 54) African countries had put in place comprehensive personal data

284

protection legislation[24]. Several regimes in the region are starting to draft legislation regarding

285

processing and movement of personal data[25], however funding attrition and the lack of regulators

286

cripple the process. That said, there are continent-wide initiatives that promise to set data

287

protection framework such as EU’s GDPR. The African Network of Personal Data Protection

288

Authorities (RAPDP), a cooperation of 8 African countries seeks to draft data protection laws,

289

formulate opinions on specific issues and establish a consultative framework on data protection.

290

There are also regional conventions for data protection and privacy that have been enacted such as

291

the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Model Law[26] for the south and the Act on

292

Personal Data Protection within ECOWAS (Economic Community of West African States) for the

293

west[27]. Unlike their southern and western counterparts, east African nations have not adopted

294

similar regional frameworks, which can set cross-border and data portability limitations. In addition,

295

some countries national laws fall short in setting the required safeguards for data privacy breach and

296

data portability and lack bodies such as Data Protection Authorities to enforce these legislations[24].

297

This is just the African scenario, but every country and region will have their own set of policies.

298

Therefore, the healthcare programme and data controllers have an important responsibility to

299

manage the programme in compliance with local laws or, where lacking, consult with government

300

authorities on which regulation to abide by to foremost protect patient rights. Regulation of CDSS is

301

also very contentious topic. Groups will have to watch this space, FDA and European Commission

302

regulations, closely to determine whether their tool fits the definition of a Software as a Medical

303

Device (SaMD) and what data they will need to generate for regulatory approval.

304

In terms of “Validation”, the big question was how to ensure CDSAs are safe for use. Developers and

305

implementers should aim for clinical association, analytical validation and clinical validation.

306

However clinical validation can require significant amount of financial resources and time. As an

307

example, e-POCT was developed in 2014 to incorporate the latest scientific evidence to expand the

308

medical content of IMCI. Its safety and efficacy was determined in a RCT in Tanzanian outpatient

309

clinics[17]. However, in 2019 the tool has yet been implemented at scale or evaluated in non-

310

controlled settings. Efforts like e-POCT to optimise CDSA content and assess its impact on patient

311

health outcomes are needed to grow the evidence for CDSA’s role in improving patient safety. But

312

providing these tools to patient also demands that we put our efforts in studies to measure the

313

effectiveness of CDSA while in the hands of the end-user and in the setting of intended use. Indeed,

314

there may be factors when CDSAs are implemented as part of routine practice that affect the overall

315

effectiveness and impact of the tool. This includes a lack of or poor health worker training, lack of

316

connectivity, software malfunctions, poor design leading to low usability and acceptability of the

317

tool by health workers. Cycles of evaluation and improvement can be sought to perfect these tools

318

in intended settings.

319

In addition, digital data obtained from CDSA validation can be used in turn to dynamically improve

320

the tool itself faster than development improvements in classic wet diagnostics. CDSA also have the

24

321

potential to serve as platforms to support the evaluation or development of new content or

322

guidelines. These can be faster adapted to geographies to conform to local policies.

323
324

The call for the development of PHC during the declaration of Astana revived the global commitment

325

to provide quality health services to all[28]. Achieving universal health coverage will therefore

326

require that digital health interventions are quality assured and evidence-based. Indeed, the WHO

327

has begun developing frameworks to create a common digital language and synthetizing the

328

evidence around emerging mobile-based digital health technologies through two recent

329

publications[29, 88]. These resources are meant to guide the global health community in assessing

330

digital interventions that will improve quality of care, meaning interventions that are safe, effective,

331

timely, efficient, equitable and people-centred, and this include CDSAs[30].

332

The management of patients in low-resource settings with complex epidemiology is extremely

333

challenging without clinical algorithms and accurate and portable rapid diagnostic tests.

334

Consequences of suboptimal quality of care can go even beyond the patient’s health to include

335

public health considerations such as the development of antimicrobial resistance due to the over-

336

prescribing of medicines. The aim of the proposed TPP is to support developers and implementers of

337

these toolkits aimed at guiding health workers throughout clinical assessment, to give them

338

confidence in clinical decisions and actions, whether it is sending a patient to a hospital or not,

339

prescribing or not prescribing antibiotics or recommending rehydration at home.
