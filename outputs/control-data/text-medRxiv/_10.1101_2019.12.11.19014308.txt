Abstract
Cardiovascular diseases have their origin in childhood. Early biomarkers identifying
individuals with increased risk for disease are needed to support early detection and to optimize
prevention strategies. By applying machine learning approach on high throughput NMR-based
metabolomics data, we identified metabolic predictors of cardiovascular risk in circulation in
a cohort of 396 females, followed from childhood (mean age 11.2 years) to early adulthood
(mean age 18.1 years). The identified childhood metabolic signature included three circulating
biomarkers robustly associating with increased cardiovascular risk in early adulthood (AUC =
0.641 to 0.802, all p<0.01). These associations were confirmed in two validation cohorts
including middle-aged women, with similar effect estimates. We subsequently applied random
intercept cross-lagged panel model analysis, which suggested causal relationship between
metabolites and cardio-metabolic risk score from childhood to early adulthood. These results
provide evidence for the utility of circulating metabolomics panel to identify children and
adolescents at risk for cardiovascular disease, to whom preventive measures and follow-up
could be indicated.

Background
Cardiovascular diseases are the largest contributors to global mortality and morbidity1, and a
significant economic burden to the healthcare system2. Cardio-metabolic abnormalities,
including hyperglycemia, elevated blood pressure, dyslipidemia and abdominal obesity are risk
factors for the development of cardiovascular diseases3-6. Although the clinical complications
of cardiovascular disease typically manifest in adulthood, autopsy and observational studies
have shown that development of atherosclerosis starts in childhood and adolescence, and is
associated with the same cardiovascular disease risk factors that are well established in adults7.
Early identification of children who are at risk of developing cardiovascular disease would
allow instituting and maintaining optimum health behaviors, at a time when it is likely to be
most effective.
The availability of metabolic screens provides an opportunity to identify biomarkers associated
with cardiovascular risk. For example, using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry Cheng
et al. demonstrated that obesity, hypertension, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia were
associated with multiple circulating metabolites including branched-chain and aromatic amino
acids in adults8. These same metabolites have also been consistently associated with future
development of type 2 diabetes9 and cardiovascular disease10. Metabolomics profiling studies
in children and adolescents, however, have reported conflicting results; most of these previous
studies are cross-sectional, and the few existing longitudinal studies have short follow-up
durations and small number of participants

11-17

. Therefore, longitudinal studies examining

temporal associations between the circulating metabolome and cardio-metabolic risk factors
from childhood to adulthood are needed. In this study, we used an NMR-based metabolomics
platform to quantify 121 circulating metabolic measures in children followed longitudinally
from pre-puberty to early adulthood. Our results show that a small pre-pubertal metabolic
signature predicts cardio-metabolic risk score in adulthood, and provides evidence for a causal

role of atherogenic lipoprotein particles and systemic low-grade inflammation in
cardiovascular disease pathogenesis.
Results
Cardio-metabolic risk score
We first examined cardio-metabolic risk factor clustering, i.e. metabolic syndrome, defined as
the presence of at least three of the following five risk factors: abdominal obesity (waist
circumference >88 cm), elevated blood pressure (≥130/85 mmHg), elevated fasting blood
glucose (≥5.6 mmol/L), elevated serum triglycerides (≥1.7 mmol/L) and reduced serum highdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) (<1.29 mmol/L)18 in a total of 396 Finnish adolescent
females that participated in a longitudinal study, from pre-puberty (mean age, 11.2 years) to
early adulthood (mean age, 18.1 years) (Table 1). At the 7.5 years follow-up, 3.2% of the
participants were classified as having metabolic syndrome according to this definition. In
addition, 10.8% of the participants had two risk factors, 40.1% had one risk factor, and 45.9%
had no positive cardio-metabolic risk factors. Due to the low prevalence of metabolic syndrome
and relatively high prevalence of two and single risk factors in this cohort, we constructed a
continuously distributed variable to represent clustering of cardio-metabolic risk factors
referred to as “MetS” score from here on19. The MetS score was calculated similarly to
previously published scores20-22 by standardizing and then summing (separately for each
measurement wave) the following continuously distributed metabolic traits: mean arterial
pressure ([(2 x diastolic blood pressure) + systolic blood pressure]/3); abdominal fat mass;
fasting plasma glucose; serum high-density lipoprotein cholesterol-1; and fasting serum
triglyceride z-scores. A higher score indicates a higher cardio-metabolic risk.

Correlation network of circulating metabolites with cardio-metabolic risk score
We next explored cross-sectional associations of serum metabolites (Supplementary Figure
1) with the MetS score at each measurement wave (baseline, 2-year and 7.5-year follow-up) to
assess the stability of associations during the course of pubertal growth. Several lipoprotein
subclasses, high-density lipoprotein diameter (HDL-D), HDL-2C and VLDL-TG,
apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A1 ratio (ApoB/ApoA1) and glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA)
were consistently associated with MetS score at all three time points after correcting for
multiple hypothesis testing (Figure 1, inner cycle and Supplementary Figure 1a and b and
Supplementary Table 2). In addition, we found associations of apolipoprotein A1 and omega
6 fatty acids with the MetS score at baseline and 2-year follow-up, very-low-density lipoprotein
(VLDL-D)

adjustment for physical activity, dietary intake and other covariates (i.e., sex hormones, SHBG
and IGF-1, insulin, adiponectin, leptin and vitamin D) did not materially change the results.
The significant correlations between metabolites and MetS score are presented in

Serum metabolites predict future MetS score
We used the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method to identify
circulating metabolites that predict the MetS score from pre-puberty to early adulthood using
a five-fold cross-validation scheme (CV) (Supplementary File 1). Of the 121 metabolites
measured for each study participant, ten metabolites at baseline and 11 metabolites at 2-year
follow-up were retained in the final model. These subsets of metabolites were predictive of

MetS score at 7.5 year follow-up, explaining on average 20.1% (r2 ranged from -0.39 to 0.55)
and 11.9% (r2 ranged from -0.26 to 0.63) of the variance, respectively (Figure 2a,b,d,e,
Supplementary File 1 and Supplementary Table 4). The identified metabolites, included
different amino acids, glycolysis and inflammation related metabolites, ketone bodies, fatty
acids, apolipoproteins, and lipoprotein subclass particles. Four metabolites (glutamine, LHDL-PL, ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, GlycA) were retained in the model at both time points, showing
greater associations with increasing age. (Supplementary Table 4).

Performance of cardio-metabolic risk prediction
To test the ability of the metabolites to distinguish individuals with high cardio-metabolic risk
from those with low risk we stratified the study participants into quartiles based on their MetS
score values at 7.5 year follow-up and performed Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC)
analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) indicated that of the metabolites identified by
LASSO at baseline, ApoB/ApoA1, MUFA, Glycerol, GlycA and L- M-VLDL-TG and LHDL-PL were able to classify individuals with high MetS score (AUC: 0.643 to 0.763, p =
0.001 to p < 0.0001, Figure 2c), while L-HDL-PL ApoB/ApoA1,GlycA, Glutamine ,
ApoA1,and M-HDL-FC were significant classifiers at the 2-year follow-up (AUC: 0.684 to
0.802, p = 0.03 to p < 0.0001, Figure 2f).

Directional influences between the serum metabolites and cardio-metabolic risk
To assess the direction of causality between the metabolites and MetS score associations, we
applied Random Intercept Cross-lagged panel analysis model (RI-CLPM, Figure 3a), which
is a multilevel structural equation model that partitions the between-person variance from the

within-person variance, thus allowing estimating cross-lagged effects both at between-person
and at within-person level, while controlling for correlations within time-points and
autoregressive effects, or stability, across time. The autoregressive part of the model showed
that the previous MetS score predicted the subsequent MetS score at each time point from
childhood to early adulthood. Similar effects were observed between the repeated
measurements of ApoB/ApoA1 and GlycA and L-HDL-PL (all p < 0.001, Figure 3b and c)
Likelihood ratio tests indicated a significant between-subjects effect in the model when
ApoB/ApoA1 (χ2df=3 = 17.0, p = 0.001, Figure 3b), GlycA (χ2df=3 = 10.2, p = 0.017, Figure
3c), or L-HDL-PL (χ2df=3 =12.1, p = 0.007, Figure 3d), were considered, while the withinsubject effects did not have a significant contribution for either ApoB/ApoA1 (χ2df=4 = 3.7, p
= 0.442) or GlycA (χ2df=4 = 4.6, p = 0.333) or L-HDL-PL (χ2df=4 = 8.6, p = 0.072).
Causal predominance was examined by comparing standardized coefficients of the crosslagged paths, and the results suggested a causal effect of baseline ApoB/ApoA1 on MetS score
at 2-year follow-up, while MetS score at 2-year follow-up had causal effect on ApoB/ApoA1
at 7.5-year follow-up (Figure 3b). Similarly, the MetS score at baseline had a causal effect on
L-HDL-PL at 2-year follow-up, while L-HDL-PL at 2 year-follow-up had a causal effect on
MetS score at 7.5 year follow-up (Figure 3d). The results also suggested causal predominance
of MetS score at baseline and at 2 year-follow-up on GlycA both at 2-year and 7.5-year followups, but associations were not statistically significant (Figure 3c). All RI-CLPM results are
shown in Supplementary Table 5.

Key metabolite predictors are confirmed in two validation cohorts

other included a cohort of middle-aged overweight and obese pre-menopausal women (n =
105). Characteristics of the participants are shown in Supplementary Table 6. Among the
sisters, 5.2% of the participants had metabolic syndrome, 16.9% had two positive risk factors,
40.3% had one positive risk factor, and 37.7% had no positive cardio-metabolic risk factors. In
mothers, 12.6% of the participants had metabolic syndrome, 20.2% had two positive risk
factors, 28.2% had one positive risk factor, and 20.2% had no positive cardio-metabolic risk
factors. In pre-menopausal women, 26.4% of the participants had metabolic syndrome, 36.8%
had two positive risk factors, 31.1% had one positive risk factor, and 5.7% had no positive
cardio-metabolic risk factors.
As the validation cohort includes overweight and obese women with more cardio-metabolic
risk factors, this allowed us to compare the concentrations of the metabolite biomarkers
identified in the discovery cohort between healthy women and women with metabolic
syndrome, to validate that the differences observed in puberty persist into adulthood (Figure
4a and Supplementary Table 7). Furthermore, in mothers (Figure 4b and Supplementary
Table 7) and sisters (Figure 4c and Supplementary Table 7), we compared the high risk and
low risk groups by quartiles (the highest quartile represents high risk).
We further used LASSO for these two validation data sets and the performance was similar to
the discovery dataset (Supplementary file 2). In the sisters and mothers, the explained variance
of metabolites predicting MetS was similar to pre-menopausal women (r2 = 0.51 and r2 = 0.54,
respectively, Supplementary file 2) which were comparable to the discovery cohort at baseline
(r2 = 0.77) and 7.5-year follow-up (r2 = 0.58). The AUCs were similar to the discovery cohort
as well (Figure 5 a, b and c and Supplementary Table 8). This analysis validates that the
identified metabolites are elevated in women who are at high risk of cardio-metabolic disease.

Discussion
In this study, we utilized a rich longitudinal data resource to identify a metabolic signature in
childhood that predicts increased cardiovascular disease risk in adulthood. These metabolic
measures have atherogenic properties and reflect chronic systemic inflammation, previously
associated with future cardiovascular disease and pre-mature mortality in older individuals.
Thus, our results provide further evidence that the pathogenic processes that contribute to
cardiovascular diseases in later life originate in childhood and adolescence, providing an
impetus to earlier intervention strategies to reduce the global burden of cardiovascular disease.
We found that the serum ApoB/ApoA1 ratio in childhood strongly and consistently predicted
future cardio-metabolic risk score (MetS) across all time points. ApoB and ApoA1 are the two
main lipoproteins involved in lipid transport. ApoB is the main protein in VLDL and LDL
(atherogenic) particles, while ApoA1 is the main protein in HDL (anti-atherogenic) particles.
This result is supported by an earlier 9-year follow-up study in school girls from childhood to
adulthood, demonstrating that ApoB/ApoA1 ratio was associated with metabolic syndrome and
it’s components23. In another prospective study, Juonala et al. reported that ApoB and ApoA1
levels and their ratio in adolescence were associated with carotid artery intima-media thickness
and brachial artery flow-mediated dilation in adulthood24. In that study, ApoB and ApoA1 were
stronger predictors of abnormal vascular changes than conventional cholesterol measurements
(LDL-C and HDL-C), which suggests that the carriers (apolipoproteins) might play a more
central role than the actual lipid content transported in these lipoprotein particles. These
findings are further supported by the Pathobiological Determinants of Atherosclerosis in Youth
study which found apolipoproteins associated with postmortem arterial lesions25, and the
Bogalusa Heart Study, which showed that high ApoB/ApoA1 ratio in children was associated
with incidence of parental myocardial infarction26.

We also found strong inverse association between L-HDL phospholipids in childhood and
cardio-metabolic risk in early adulthood. A previous study by Piperi et al. found that HDLphospholipids were more closely related to coronary artery disease than HDL-C or other
lipoproteins studied

27

, and Meikle et al. recently reported that HDL phospholipids, but not

HDL cholesterol, distinguished acute coronary syndrome from stable coronary artery disease28.
Low serum HDL-phospholipid concentrations have also been associated with high coronary
artery calcification scores in asymptomatic patients with atherosclerosis29, and with increased
risk of metabolic syndrome and coronary heart disease, particularly in women30. Our key
finding of the strong inverse association between L-HDL phospholipids in childhood and
cardio-metabolic risk in early adulthood was confirmed in both validation cohorts,
demonstrating that adult women with metabolic syndrome had lower serum L-HDL-PL
concentration than their healthy counterparts. It has been previously shown that HDL
phospholipids play an important role in the cholesterol efflux process31, and that metabolic
syndrome is associated with progressive reduction in cholesterol efflux capacity, which
contribute to development of atherosclerosis32. Taken together, our results suggest that
exposure to an atherogenic apolipoprotein profile and low HDL phospholipids in childhood
may cause reduced cholesterol efflux capacity and changes in the arteries that contribute to the
development of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease in adulthood.
It is increasingly recognized that the atherosclerotic process involves not only lipid and
lipoprotein metabolism but it also requires a pro-inflammatory response that includes both the
innate and acquired immune systems 33. Another metabolite predicting MetS score in our study
was GlycA, which is a novel marker of systemic inflammation reflecting signals originating
from glycan groups of acute-phase glycoproteins, mainly a1-acid glycoprotein, but also other
acute-phase reactants such as haptoglobin, a1-antitrypsin, a1-antichymotrypsin, and
transferrin34. GlycA has been found to correlate with adiposity, insulin resistance and other

11

markers of metabolic syndrome in adults 35, 36, suggesting that in addition to being elevated in
acute inflammation, GlycA might also be biomarker of subclinical vascular inflammation

37

.

Accordingly, it was recently shown that plasma GlycA is independently associated with the
incidence of cardiovascular disease in a large cohort study of initially healthy women 37.
Elevated circulating GlycA levels have also been shown to predict risk of type 2 diabetes 38,
nonalcoholic fatty liver disease39, and all-cause mortality40 in adults, but so far, no comparable
data are available in children and adolescents. In our study, GlycA levels in childhood and
adolescence strongly and consistently predicted MetS score in early adulthood, and this finding
was confirmed in both validation cohorts. Thus, the findings our study confirm and extend the
results of earlier reports by demonstrating that GlycA is viable biomarker of systemic
subclinical inflammation associated with increased cardio-metabolic risk not only in adults but
also in children and adolescents. However, further studies are needed before GlycA could be
adopted as a routinely used in clinical test for the purposes of risk assessment, management, or
follow-up in pediatric populations.
We further investigated the direction of associations between metabolite biomarkers and
cardio-metabolic risk in a random intercept cross-lagged path model. The results revealed a
consistent pattern in which increased ApoB/ApoA1 ratio in childhood was associated with an
increased MetS score in adolescence, and MetS score in adolescence was associated with
increased ApoB/ApoA1 ratio in early adulthood. Similar sequence of reciprocal cause and
effect was observed between the MetS score and the other two key metabolites i.e. L-HDL-PL
and GlycA from childhood to early adulthood, suggesting that metabolites and cardiovascular
risk factors aggravate each other, leading inexorably to a worsening cardio-metabolic health.

The major strength of our study is the longitudinal data on females followed from pre-puberty
to early adulthood, which enabled us to explore the temporal associations between circulating
metabolites and cardio-metabolic risk during pubertal growth. We were also able to validate
the main results in females of different ages in three other datasets. Furthermore, downstream
analyses allowed us to determine the specificity and sensitivity of the most important
metabolite biomarkers, and explore the direction of causation between metabolites and MetS.
However, some limitations warrant consideration. The cohort included only females which
limits the generalization of the results. Furthermore, the prevalence of metabolic syndrome in
adolescents was low. However, while binary definition of metabolic syndrome might be a
useful tool for clinical practice to assess cardiovascular disease risk in adults18, continuous
MetS score is more appropriate for epidemiological studies for the following reasons: first,
dichotomizing continuous outcome variables reduces statistical power41; second, the risk of
cardiovascular disease is an aggregative progressive function of several risk factors42, and third,
cardiovascular risk increases progressively with increasing numbers of risk factors43.
Therefore, multiple studies with pediatric and adult populations have used continuous
metabolic risk scores, integrating components of the metabolic syndrome definition to
represent clustering of metabolic risk factors.
Conclusions
We identified a robust signature of serum metabolites, including ApoB/ApoA1 ratio, GlycA,
and L-HDL-PL, which may serve as early biomarkers for increased cardio-metabolic risk in
children and adolescents. Further studies are needed to explore the generalizability and the
potential clinical utility of these biomarkers to lower the global burden of cardiometabolic
disease through shaping early-life health strategies.

Study setting
The study was conducted in the city of Jyväskylä, and the surrounding area in Central Finland.
Circulating metabolite concentrations were analyzed using a high-throughput serum nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics platform that quantified 121 metabolite measures
including routine lipids, lipoprotein subclass distributions, particle size and composition, fatty
acids and other low-molecular-weight metabolites such as amino acids and glycolysis-related
metabolites (all metabolites measures in the platform are shown in Supplementary Table 1).
In addition, behavioral characteristics, including leisure-time physical activity, dietary intake
as well as medical history were collected via validated self-administered questionnaires. Body
composition was assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Sex-hormones,
sex-hormones binding globulin (SHBG), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin, leptin,
adiponectin, parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxyvitamin D were determined using standard
protocols.
Subjects
A total of 396 girls (mean age 11.2 years at baseline) participated in a longitudinal study at
different time points for an average of 7.5 years. Detailed meta-data regarding the participants
and study design have been reported previously44, 45. Briefly, the subjects were first contacted
via class teachers of grades 4 to 6 (age 9 to 13 years old) in 61 schools in the city of Jyväskylä
and its surroundings, located Central Finland (96% of all the schools in these areas). For this
report, we included subjects with valid data on body composition, cardio-metabolic risk
markers and serum metabolomics. Thirteen individuals who reported using oral contraceptives
at the age of 18 were excluded from this study. The final discovery cohort dataset included 215
girls at baseline (100% were pre-menarche), 192 at 2-year (38% were pre-menarche) and at
222 7.5-year follow-up (100% post-menarche) (Table 1).

Cross-sectional data from the discovery cohort participant’s sisters (aged 18.6 years, n = 74)
and their biological mothers (aged 48.4 years, n = 206) and an independent cohort of Finnish
pre-menopausal women (aged 41.5 years, n = 105) was included in the study for the purpose
of validation of results obtained from the discovery cohort (Supplementary Table 6).
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and their parents. The study was
conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and approved by the Ethic
Committee of the Central Hospital of Central Finland and the Finnish National Agency of
Medicines (memo 22/8/2008 and 5/2009).
Background information
Health history and lifestyle characteristics were collected via self-administered questionnaires
at the time of laboratory tests (baseline, 24- and 7.5-year follow-up). Dietary intake of total
energy and energy-yielding nutrients was assessed from three-day food records (2 week days
and 1 weekend day) using Micro-Nutrica software (Social Insurance Institution, Turku,
Finland) as described elsewhere46). Leisure time physical activity (PA), including walking,
jogging, running, gym fitness, ball games, swimming, etc., expressed as hours/week and
times/week, and a score of PA was evaluated using a validated self-administered PA
questionnaire, as previously described47.
Anthropometry and body composition assessments
Body height was measured using a stadiometer. Body weight was measured using an electronic
scale with subjects wearing only underwear. BMI was calculated by dividing body weight in
kilograms by the square of the body height (in meters). Blood pressure (BP) in the right arm
was recorded using an automated oscillometric method (OMRON M3 Intellisense, OMRON

Two consecutive measurements were performed, and the mean of the measurements was used.
Menarche age was deﬁned as the ﬁrst onset of menstrual bleeding and was collected by
questionnaire, retrospective phone call, and/or interview during a clinical visit.
Lean tissue mass, and fat mass of the whole body, and abdominal region were assessed using
DXA (Prodigy GE Lunar Corp., Madison, WI USA). Precision of the repeated measurements
expressed as a coefficient of variation (CV%) were 1.0% for LM, and 2.2% for FM.
Circulating biomarker assessments
Blood samples from the antecubital vein were collected between 7 and 9 AM after an overnight
fast. The samples were collected during early follicular phase (2 to 5 days after the beginning
of menstruation) in subjects with regular menses. All samples were handled and analyzed by a
qualified phlebotomist using slandered protocols. Serum and plasma were extracted from blood
by centrifugation and stored immediately at −80°C until analyzed. Plasma glucose was
assessed by KONELAB 20XTi analyzer (Thermo Fischer Scientific inc. Waltham, MA, USA).
Insulin was measured by immunofluorescence using the IMMULITE Analyser (Diagnostic
Products Corporation, Los Angeles). The inter- and intra-assay CVs were 2.0% and 3.7 % for
glucose and 11% and 3.4% for insulin, respectively.
Serum leptin was assessed using human leptin (ELISA; Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Inc.,
Webster, TX) and adiponectin was measured by an enzymeimmunoassay method using the
Quantikine Human Total Adiponectin/Acrp30 Immunoassay (R&D Systems). Insulin-like
growth factor 1 (IGF-1) was assessed using time-resolved fluoroimmunoassays (IMMULITE;
Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, IL, USA). Estradiol (E2), testosterone (Te) and sex hormone
binding globulin (SHBG) were determined using ELISA (NovaTec Immundiagnostica GmbH,
Dietzenbach,

Germany).

(PTH) concentrations was measured by using an immunoradiometric method (Nichols
Institute, Juan San Capistrano, CA). Inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation (CVs) were
4.6%, 2.7% and 2.2% for leptin, 3.3% and 4.3% for adiponectin, 6.1% and 3.1% for IGF-1,
3.2% and 5.4% for E2, 3.9%, 6.2% for Te, and 1.1% and 1.1% for SHBG, 10% and 15% for
25(OH)D, and 4% and 3% for PTH, respectively.
Serum metabolite concentrations were analyzed using a high-throughput nuclear magnetic
resonance (NMR) metabolomics platform. The experimental protocols, including sample
preparation and NMR spectroscopy, have been described in detail elsewhere48. This
methodology combines three molecular windows that contain the majority of the metabolic
information available by 1H NMR from native serum such as serum lipids, cholesterol,
lipoprotein subclasses as well as various low-molecular-weight metabolites, including amino
acids, ketone bodies and glycolysis intermediates. The final number of metabolites included in
this report was 121 (full list of metabolites measured in this study are shown in Supplementary
Table 1).
Cardio-metabolic risk assessment
To assess cardio-metabolic risk, a standardized continuously distributed variable for clustered
metabolic risk (MetS score) was constructed similar to previously published scores

20-22

. The

risk score was calculated by standardizing and then summing the following continuously
distributed metabolic traits: mean arterial pressure ([(2 x diastolic blood pressure) + systolic
blood pressure]/3); abdominal fat mass; fasting plasma glucose; serum HDL cholesterol x -1;
and fasting serum triglyceride z-score. The z-scores for each variable and MetS scores were
calculated separately for each time point. A higher score indicates a higher cardio-metabolic
risk.

Continuous data were tested for normality by Shapiro-Wilk's test before each analysis. If data
were not normally distributed, their natural logarithms were used in all analyses. Descriptive
statistics are presented as means and 95% confidence interval (CI).
Correlation network: Bivariate Spearman correlation between metabolites (n=121) and MetS
was used to calculate correlation coefficients for each time point by using R statistics and the
correlation network was drawn using Cytoscape version 3.7.1. In the network, each node
represents a variable while the edges represent significant correlations between the connected
nodes. Multiple testing correction between MetS and metabolites as well as among metabolites
was performed using the Bonferroni method with an adjusted p-value cutoff of 0.05. The
metabolites that were significantly correlated with MetS after Bonferroni correction are
presented in Supplementary Table 2.
In addition, Bivariate Spearman partial correlation was performed controlling for hormones
(insulin, leptin, adiponectin, IGF-1, E2, Te, SHBG, 25(OHD) and PTH, PA score, and energy
(Kcal/day) and energy yield micronutrients (protein, carbohydrate and fats E%).

LASSO regression: To predict future cardio-metabolic risk, we applied LASSO analysis using
the R GLMNET package40. The parameters of the LASSO used in this report are given in
supplemental material (Supplementary File 1). In the LASSO analysis, MetS from baseline
to 2-year and 7.5 year follow-up was treated as a continuous variable and only girls who had
data for both time points were included (baseline to 2-year paired n=172, baseline to 7.5 year
paired n=88 and 2-year to 7.5-year paired n=89). We performed a 5-fold cross-validation. In
each fold, 80% of the data was used to train the LASSO model and then performance was
evaluated using the 20% of the data not used for model optimization. This process was repeated
five times on each of the five folds of the data, resulting in 5 test-set out-of-sample r-square

values of five different models. This method obtain a conservative estimate of model
performance (Supplementary File 1).
Diagnostic performance of cardio-metabolic risk
To assess the “diagnostic performance” i.e. specificity and sensitivity of the LASSO-identified
high cardio-metabolic risk by metabolites, we stratified the study participants into quartiles
based on their MetS score values. The highest quartile was considered as the high-risk group.
For premenopausal women, the high-risk group was defined by women with metabolic
syndrome (MS). We then performed AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristics) analysis using R plot ROC package. The area under the curve (AUC) was
reported in Figure 2c and f only for those metabolites which were significant with 95%
confidence interval (CI).
Cross-lagged paths model (CLPM): The CPLM is based on an empirically-motivated definition
of causality49, where the association is considered to have a causal interpretation, if the
preceding measurement of a predictor explains the current response while adjusting for the
preceding measurement of the response. The parameters of main interest include directed paths
for the auto-regressive relationships, which can be viewed as measures of the temporal stability
of the variables across time-points, and cross-lagged relationships, which are used to assess
predictive relationships between the variables at consecutive time points. Because the crosslagged effects are represented as path coefficients and not correlations, it is possible that the
estimate of the effect from the predictor to the response can take an opposite sign when
compared to the observed correlation between those variables. This difference is due to the fact
that the predictor’s effect is partialled out from the previous measurement of the response. The
bidirectional associations between the identified metabolites and MetS were analyzed by Mplus
version 7.4.

Validation: We validated the performance of the biomarkers retained by LASSO using R
(v.3.6.0) GLMNET (v.2.0) package in two other cross-sectional data sets (participants’ sisters
and their biological mothers and in a cohort of unrelated pre-menopausal women). 121
metabolites overlapping with the ones measured in the discovery cohort were used as input,
and the prediction of MetS was output. R squared value of the correlation between predicted
and observed MetS was calculated to represent the model performance. All training and test
data were scaled and standardized to mean 0 and standard deviation 1 before analysis
(Supplementary File 2).
In addition, we compared the highest quartile to the lowest 3 quartiles in sisters and mothers,
and NMS to 1-risk, 2-risk and MetS in premenopausal women by analysis of variance followed
by Sidak for multiple group comparison (Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 7). Then, we
compared those with MetS to those without MetS by ROC (Figure 5 and Supplementary
Table 8) as described in above diagnostic performance of cardio-metabolic risk section.
