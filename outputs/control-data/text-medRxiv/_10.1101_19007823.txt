Abstract
Background: Although Respiratory distress is one of the major causes of neonatal morbidity
and mortality throughout the globe, it is a serious concern more of in resource limited nations,
like Ethiopia. Besides, few studies are available in developing countries. Data from different
settings is needed to tackle it. Therefore, we intended to assess the incidence and predictors of
respiratory distress among neonates who were admitted in neonatal Intensive care unit (NICU) at
Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia.
Methods: Institution-based retrospective follow-up study was conducted among 571 neonates
from January 2013 to March 2018. Data were collected by reviewing patients chart using
systematic sampling technique with a pretested checklist; entered using Epi-data 4.2 and
analyzed with STATA 14. Median time, Kaplan-Meier survival estimation curve and Log-rank
test were computed. Bivariable and multivariable Gompertz parametric hazards models were
fitted to detect the determinant of respiratory distress. Hazard ratio with a 95% confidence
interval was calculated. Variables with reported p-values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results: The proportion of respiratory distress among of neonates admitted in Black Lion
specialized hospital neonatal intensive care unit was 42.9 % (95%CI: 39.3-46.1%) with
incidence of 8.1/100(95%CI: 7.3, 8.9)).Being male [AHR=2.4 (95%CI:1.1,3.1)], neonates born
via caesarean section [AHR:1,.9((95%CI:1.6,2.3)], home delivery [AHR :2.9 (95%CI:1.5, 5,2)],
maternal diabetes mellitus [AHR 2.3(95%CI: 1.4 ,3.6)], preterm birth [AHR:2.9(95%CI:1.6,
5.1)] and APGAR score less than 7 [AHR: 3.1 (95%CI:1.8,5.0)] were found to be significant
predictors of respiratory distress.
Conclusions: The incidence of respiratory distress among neonates was found to be high. Those
neonates delivered at home, delivered through caesarean section, preterm neonates, whose
APGAR score<7, and born from diabetic mothers were more likely to develop respiratory
distress. All concerned bodies should work on preventing RD and give special attention for
multifactorial cause of it .Thus; it is indicated to promote health institutional delivery more.
Besides, a need to establish and/or strengthen strategies to prevent the occurrence of respiratory

distress among babies with low APGAR score, preterm babies, born from diabetes mellitus
mothers, and delivered through caesarean section.
Keywords: Ethiopia, neonate, respiratory distress,
Background
Respiratory distress (RD) is a common newborn problem immediately following birth. It is
typically triggered by abnormal respiratory function during the transition from fetal to neonatal
life. Tachypnea, intercostal retraction, nasal flaring, audible grunting, and cyanosis are the
common manifestation of RD. The successful transition from fetal to neonatal life requires a
series of rapid physiologic changes of the cardiorespiratory system. These changes result in
redirection of gas exchange from the placenta to the lung and comprise replacement of alveolar
fluid with air and onset of regular breathing [1]. It may be transient; yet, persistent distress
requires a rational diagnostic and therapeutic approach to optimize outcome and minimize
morbidity.
RD one of the most common reasons for neonates to be admitted to the neonatal intensive care
unit (NICU) [2, 3]. Fifteen percent of term infants and 29% of late preterm infants admitted to
the NICU develop significant respiratory morbidity. This is even higher for infants born before
34 weeks’ gestation [4].
Certain risk factors increase the likelihood of neonatal RD. Prematurity, low first and fifth
minute APGAR score, meconium-stained amniotic fluid (MSAF), caesarian section delivery,
gestational diabetes, maternal chorioamnionitis, premature rupture of membranes mother it
[5]and oligohydramnios and structural lung abnormalities are some predictors identified with
previous studies [4, 6-9]. Other common causes also include transient tachypnea of the newborn,
meconium aspiration syndrome, pneumonia, sepsis, pneumothorax, persistent pulmonary
hypertension of the newborn [10].In contrast, the risk decreases with each advancing week of
gestation and born with spontaneous vaginal delivery [11].
Regardless of the cause, if not recognized and managed quickly, respiratory distress can escalate
to respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest and finally leads to death. Therefore, it is
imperative that any health care practitioner caring for newborn infants can readily recognize the
signs and symptoms of respiratory distress, differentiate various causes, and initiate management

strategies to prevent significant complications or death. Consequently, neonates in need of
critical medical attention are admitted to the NICU ward. These infants tend to be preterm, low
birth weight, or have serious medical conditions including RD [12, 13].

Globally, there are different policies, strategies, and programs which work on prevention and
care of preterm birth and its birth outcome including RD, like Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs) and Every Women and Every Child initiative [14, 15]. Despite of this, it is among the
leading cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity [16-20].In Ethiopia, according to a report of
FMOH, RD is most common cause of neonatal mortality and morbidity [16-21]. So that, it
remains to be a major community health problem by increasing the regular price of healthcare
for neonates with in the first 28 day of life for unindustrialized nation, including Ethiopia. These
great medical expenditures might burden both the parents, families and the community at large.
Hence, this is the double agenda to address the survival gap of neonates which needs an inclusive
investigation strategy to end the preventable cause deaths of newborns. Additionally, few studies
in developing countries, including Ethiopia have provided data needed to tackle it. Therefore, we
aimed to determine the incidence and predictors of RD among neonates who were admitted in
NICU at Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia.
Methods
Study design, setting, and population: An institution-based retrospective follow-up study was
conducted among a cohort of neonates in the previous consecutive five years. Our source
population was all neonates who were admitted in NICU of Black Lion Referral Hospital. All
neonates who were admitted to NICU in the previous five consecutive years were considered as
the study population.
Eligibility criteria: All neonates’ medical cards documented in the previous five years from the
study period were recruited and incomplete cards were excluded.
Sample size determination and sampling procedure: The sample size was determined by
using double population proportion formula using Epi-Info version7 by assuming one to one
ratio of exposed to non-exposed, 95% level of confidence and power of 80%. We considered
four significantly associated factors to calculate the sample size; the larger sample size was 522.
After adding 10% non-response rate, the total sample size became 604. The neonate's card was

accessed by using systematic random sampling technique after determining the sampling fraction
(k=6) and the first card was selected by lottery method.
Study variables
Dependent variable: Incidence of RDS
Independent variables:
Socio-demographic factors: Neonatal-related variables, including age at admission, gestational
age, sex, the weight of neonate, Date of NICU admission and discharge. Maternal-related
variables were age and residency.
Gynecologic-obstetric related factors: having ANC follow up, gravidity, parity, mode of
delivery, multiple pregnancies, PROM, preeclampsia, abruption placenta, and breastfeeding
initiation
Medical disorders in mother: Hypertension, DM, HIV/AIDS
Neonatal outcome condition: Apgar score, RD, sepsis, jaundice, hypothermia, PNA,
hypoglycemia, meningitis, esophageal atresia, CHD.
Data collection tools: Pretested checklist was used to collect the required data from the patient's
chart. The checklist was translated to local language Amharic and back to English; consistency
was checked. Data were collected by reviewing the complete patients' card in the previous five
consecutive years from the study period. RD was confirmed by reviewing the medical charts.
Data quality control: Data quality was assured by designing proper data abstraction tools. The
checklist was evaluated by experienced researchers. The data collection instrument was pretested on 5% of the sample size. Rigorous training was given regarding the data abstraction
checklist and data collection process for both data collectors and supervisors. During the data
collection time, close supervision and monitoring were carried out by supervisors and
investigator. Double data entry was also done using Epi data 4.2.0 software.
Data processing, analysis, and presentation: Before analysis, data was cleaned, edited and
coded. Any errors identified at this time were corrected after review of the original data using the
code numbers. Data were entered using Epi-Data version 4.2.0 and analyzed using STATA 14

statistical software. Incidence density rate (IDR) was calculated for the entire study period.
Subsequently, the number of RD within the follow-up period was divided by the total persontime at risk on follow-up and reported per 100-person day. Kaplan-Meir was used to estimate
median mean survival time and log-rank tests were used to compare survival curves.
Proportional hazard assumption was tested both using graphically. We also done the Schoenfeld
residual test for all predictors and the global test revealed that the proportional hazard
assumption is met. After checking this assumption, by comparing models, a more effective
hazard model was selected by using log likelihood ratio (LR) test and the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC). In the parametric approach, the baseline hazard and the vector of its parameters
is assessed together with the regression coefficients. The best-fitted model was chosen using
AIC; those having the smallest AIC. Then, parametric models were completed for neonates to
ascertain the possible predictors. Variables having a p-value less than or equal to 0.05 in the
bivariate analysis were fitted to the multivariable Gompertz hazard distribution regression model
with a 95% confidence interval. A p-value less than 0.05 were considered as statistically
significant.
Operational definition
Event (neonatal respiratory distress): The presence of two or more of the following signs: an
abnormal respiratory rate (tachypnea > 60breaths/min, bradypnea < 30 breaths/minute,
respiratory pauses, or apnea) or signs of labored breathing (expiratory grunting, nasal flaring,
intercostal recessions, xyphoid recessions), with or without cyanosis.
RD: was diagnosed based on the presence of two or more of the following signs: an abnormal
respiratory rate, expiratory Grunting, nasal flaring, chest wall recessions and cyanosis, in their
files
Results
Characteristics of neonates
Among 604 neonates’ charts reviewed, 571 (94.5%) records were met enrollment criteria in the
final analysis. Of which, about 299 (52.34%) of the study participants were males. Neonates in
late neonatal period account more than half of the study participant. The mean age of the cohort
at the time of admission to NICU was 3 ± 3.72 SD days. In this finding, more than half of
neonates admitted to NICU were diagnosed with neonatal sepsis. The other common causes of

Overall Proportion and incidence rate of RD in neonates
This finding showed that 245(42.9%) with (95%CI: 39.3-46.1)) were developed RD. The overall
incidence of RD was also found to be 8.1 per 100 neonate day with 95%CI :( 7.29, 8.9) with
4331-person day observation.
Time to discharge of neonates with RD
The overall median length of hospital stay for neonates with RD under the study was 9 days with
(95%CI; 8-10) and overall length of hospital stay were 28 neonates days with an interquartile
range of (5, 30) neonate-days. The cumulative probability of neonates not to be developed RD at
the end of the first day was 94.4%, at fifth to 10th days was 41.3%, and at 20–28days was
19.14% (See figure 2).

Predictors of respiratory distress
The univariate and multivariable parametric Gompertz hazard distribution regression model was
used to identify predictors of RD for neonates from admission to discharge in the neonatal
intensive care unit. Findings from bivariate analysis showed that weight for gestational, being
male, having no antenatal follow-up, multiple pregnancy, neonates born via caesarean section
,home delivery, PROM, maternal DM and HIV/ADIS, preterm birth, neonatal sepsis

and

APGAR score less than 7 were significantly associated with time to discharge of neonates with

RD. However, in the multi-variable analysis being male, neonates born via caesarean section,
home delivery, maternal DM, preterm birth, neonatal sepsis, PROM and Apgar score less than 7
were continued statistically significant predictors of RD. The hazard of RD in male neonates was
2.4 times increase than their counterpart [AHR: 2.4(95%CI: 1.1, 3.1)] The current study also
showed that the hazard of RD among neonates born via caesarean section was nearly 2 times
increased hazard than neonates born through vaginally [AHR:1,.9((95%CI:1.6,2.3)]. In this
study, the risk of RD for neonates born at home was almost 3 times higher than those delivered
at health institution [AHR :2.9 (95%CI:1.5, 5,2)]. This result also indicated that neonates
delivered from mothers who had DM increased the risk of RD by 2.3 times as compared with
their counterpart [AHR 2.3(95%CI: 1.4, 3.6)]. As the gestational age increases in 1 week the rate
of RD s was decreased by 10% [AHR: 2.9(95%CI: 1.6, 5.1)]. The risk of RD was also
increased by three times for a neonate who had APGAR score less than 7 as compared with
neonates having APGAR score greater than or equal to

7[AHR: 3.1 (95%CI:1.8,5.0)]

.Additionally, neonatal sepsis increases the risk of RD BY 60% [AHR :1.6(95%CI:1.1, 2.4)].
The last predictor for RD was born from mothers with PROM. So that neonates born from
PROM had 1.1 times higher risk of RD than their counter parts [AHR: 1.1(95%CI: 1.8, 1.5)].

Discussion
In the current study, the overall proportion of RD among neonates admitted in Black lion
specialized hospital neonatal intensive care unit was 42.9 %( 95%CI: 39.3-46.1%). This finding
is in line with a study reported in Republic of China [22]. This might be due to the study done in
china is a meta-analysis which includes 26 studies which assess the association between CS and
the risk of neonatal RDS, which might increase the proportion of RD.
However, our finding is higher than a study conducted in several countries reported by Nepal
Medical College and Teaching Hospital 34% [23], India 33.4% [9], Egypt 34.3 [24] ,National
Institute of Child Health, Karachi 4.6% [25], Northern Italian 20.1% [26] and Portugal (8.83%)
[27].

This might be due to the difference in the study setting, in which most of the study that we used
to compare was from developed countries in which neonatal, maternal health care service might
have an advanced and it will reduce the proportion of neonatal birth with RD.
In contrast, the finding is lower than a report in Saudi Arabia 54.7%[7],Cameroon 47.5%[6] and
Poland 54,29%[28]. This discrepancy might be due to difference in sample size and
characteristics of the study participants. A study in Poland for example includes a small sample
size and they try to assess the incidence of only respiratory distress syndrome which might
increase the incidence of RD.
Based on the current finding, the overall incidence of RD was 8.1 (95%CI: 7.3, 8.9) per 100
neonate-date. The common causes of respiratory distress in our study were respiratory distress
syndrome and meconium aspiration. This is true in the finding from Nepal and Egypt [23, 24].
The predictor of RD were not a single problem\ Preterm birth, caesarean section delivery,
APGAR score<7, sepsis, PROM and maternal diabetes mellitus and home delivery were found to
be predictors of RD. The risk of RD in male neonates was 2.4 times increase in than their
counterparts. This finding is similar with a study done in China [27] and Cameroon [6]. This
finding is supported by the scientific evidence that male neonates have been reported to have a
higher level of circulating testosterone than females which might be associated with differences
in pulmonary biomechanics and vascular development that lead to increased respiratory related
morbidity among males.[29].This finding also showed that the risk of RD among neonates born
via caesarean section was nearly 2 times increased hazard than neonates born through vaginally.
This finding was in line with the results reported in china [22] ,Cameroon [6] and Italy [30].
In this study, the risk of RD for neonates born at home was almost 3 times higher than those
delivered at health institution. This result also indicated that neonates delivered from mothers
who had DM increased the risk of RD by 2.3 times as compared with their counterpart. This
finding was supported with a study done in China [31].This might be neonates born from DM
women may have plentiful glucose stores in, but develops hypoglycemia because of high insulin
secretion induced by maternal and fetal hyperglycemia. This might leads to increase metabolic
demand which leads to increase in respiratory efforts.
Similarly, this study presented that a neonate who was preterm at birth was nearly 3 times at
greater hazard of having RD compared to those who were term birth. The current finding is also

supported by a study done in Cameron [6] and Italy [30]. This was supported by the proven
evidence that as gestational age increases fetal development will be increase and hazard of
developing different fatal complications including RD related with prematurity could decline and
risk of RD will be reduced as a result of lung maturity and increase production of surfactants[6].
The risk of RD was also increased by three times for a neonate who had APGAR score less
than 7 as compared with neonates having APGAR score greater than or equal to 7.This finding
is also reported by the following studies[6] [25] [26]. Neonatal sepsis was significantly
associated with the risk of developing RD .This finding is also similar with a study done in
Nepal and Egypt, [23, 24].
Conclusion The incidence of respiratory distress among neonates was found to be high. Those
neonates delivered at home, delivered through caesarean section, preterm neonates, whose
APGAR score<7, and born from diabetic mothers were more likely to develop respiratory
distress. Thus, it is indicated to promote health institutional delivery more. Besides, a need to
establish and/or strengthen strategies to prevent the occurrence of respiratory distress among
babies with low APGAR score, preterm babies, born from diabetes mellitus mothers, and
delivered through caesarean
