Abstract
Background: Certain infectious agents are recognised causes of cancer and potentially other
chronic diseases. Identifying associations and understanding pathological mechanisms
involving infectious agents and subsequent chronic disease risk will be possible through
measuring exposure to multiple infectious agents in large-scale prospective cohorts such as
UK Biobank.
Methods: Following expert consensus we designed a Multiplex Serology platform capable of
simultaneously measuring quantitative antibody responses against 45 antigens from 20
infectious agents implicated in non-communicable diseases, including human herpes,
hepatitis, polyoma, papilloma, and retroviruses, as well as Chlamydia trachomatis,
Helicobacter pylori and Toxoplasma gondii. This panel was assayed in a random subset of
UK Biobank participants (n=9,695) to test associations between infectious agents and
recognised demographic and genetic risk factors and disease outcomes.
Findings: Seroprevalence estimates for each infectious agent were consistent with those
expected from the literature. The data confirmed epidemiological associations of infectious
agent antibody responses with sociodemographic characteristics (e.g. lifetime sexual partners
with C, trachomatis; P=1·8x10-149), genetic variants (e.g. rs6927022 with Epstein-Barr virus
(EBV) EBNA1 antibodies, P=9·5x10-91) and disease outcomes including human
papillomavirus-16 seropositivity and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (odds ratio 2·28, 95%
confidence interval 1·38-3·63), and quantitative EBV viral capsid antigen responses and
multiple sclerosis through genetic correlation (MHC rG=0·30, P=0·01).
Interpretation: This dataset, intended as a pilot study to demonstrate applicability of
Multiplex Serology in epidemiological studies, is itself one of the largest studies to date
covering diverse infectious agents in a prospective UK cohort including those traditionally

Introduction
Some bacterial, viral and parasitic infectious agents are well established causal factors for
certain types of cancer1 or have been linked to the development of inflammatory diseases
such as multiple sclerosis2, and cardiovascular disease3,4. However, much of this evidence is
derived from cross-sectional or case-control analyses that are unable to determine
temporality, or from small nested case-control studies that have generally been small or have
focused on a small number of infectious agents, leading to inconsistent findings5.
UK Biobank (UKB) is a large prospective cohort study that has collected a large amount of
genetic, lifestyle, and biomarker data alongside a wide range of health outcomes for over
500,000 adults in the United Kingdom6. The depth and breadth of data available in UKB
alongside repeated biological sampling in random subsets every few years offer unique
opportunities to explore the inter-relationships between risk factors and disease outcomes in
very large numbers of individuals. The availability of serological data characterising lifetime
exposure history for multiple infectious agents would allow the retesting of putative and
identification of novel associations between infectious agents and multiple disease outcomes
whilst accounting for temporal exposure and confounders. Moreover, since many infectious
agents such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) are known to have modulatory effects on the immune
system, it is equally important to consider their exposure history when testing other noninfectious exposure and disease risk associations. Understanding the role of infectious agents
in the development of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) could have major implications for
guiding public health decisions such as targeted vaccination strategies for primary
prevention7.
Here, we describe the results from the first phase of an intended project to measure antibody
responses against 45 antigens from 20 infectious agents using a validated Multiplex Serology

panel for all 500,000 UKB participants. Using a randomly selected subset of 9,695
individuals, we demonstrate the applicability of the assay platform by confirming expected
seroprevalence estimates, and reproducing previously reported epidemiological and genetic
associations with infectious agent exposure, highlighting the significant value of these data in
understanding the role of infectious agents in the development of NCDs.
Methods
Infectious agent selection
A UK Biobank Infectious Disease Working Group was established to provide a consensus list
of infectious agents deemed to be of significant importance to public health (Supplementary
Methods), and to determine the most appropriate methodology for their measurement in a
large-scale prospective study (Supplementary Table 1). The final Multiplex Serology panel
measured antibody responses against 45 antigens spanning 20 infectious agents
(Supplementary Table 2) including herpes simplex viruses 1 and 2 (HSV-1 and -2);
varicella zoster virus (VZV); EBV; CMV; human herpesviruses 6A, 6B and 7 (HHV-6A,
HHV-6B and HHV-7); Kaposi’s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV); HIV-1; human Tlymphotropic virus-1 (HTLV-1); hepatitis B (HBV) and hepatitis C (HCV) viruses; human
papillomaviruses 16 (HPV-16) and 18 (HPV-18); the JC (JCV), BK (BKV) and Merkel cell
(MCV) polyomaviruses; Helicobacter pylori (Hp); Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct); and
Toxoplasma gondii (Tg).

UK Biobank study population
The UKB recruitment process has been described previously8. Briefly, half a million men and
women aged 40-69 years attended one of 22 UKB assessment centres located throughout
England, Scotland and Wales between 2006 and 2010. All participants completed a
touchscreen questionnaire, verbal interview and had a range of physical measurements and

blood, urine and saliva samples taken for long-term storage. A subset of 20,000 individuals
attended a repeat assessment between 2012 and 2013.
For this study, serum samples from 9,695 UKB participants were selected at random and
assayed using the final Multiplex Serology panel. For 277 (2·9%) of these participants, an
additional sample from the repeat assessment was assayed to assess stability of
seroconversion over a 4-5 year period (Supplementary Methods).

Infectious agent assay validation and quality control
Our assay was designed using the principles of an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay
(ELISA) that measures levels of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG), which is a stable biological
marker of lifetime exposure for a given infectious agent. Unlike ELISAs for individual
infectious agents, we implemented a bead-based immunoassay protocol that allows
simultaneous measurement of antibodies against multiple agent-specific antigens in the same
reaction vessel hence reducing cost and workload. As opposed to many established standard
ELISAs, which are predominantly based on inactivated multi-antigenic components of the
target infectious agent, our assay is based on measurement of antibody responses against predefined recombinantly expressed agent-specific antigens creating opportunities for agent
lifecycle-specific antigen characterisation. For each infectious agent tested, we measured
antibody responses for up to six antigens. Where two or more antigens were used, we defined
algorithms to combine the responses against multiple antigens and designate overall
seropositivity or seronegativity against individual infectious agents (Supplementary
Methods).
The workflow for validation was in line with the criteria outlined in the STARD guidelines9
(Supplementary Figure 1). The description and validation of the assays for the individual
infectious agents described here have been detailed elsewhere (Supplementary Methods

and Supplementary Table 2)10-17. In brief, Multiplex Serology is a bead-based glutathione
S-transferase (GST) capture assay incorporating glutathione-casein coated fluorescencelabelled polystyrene beads and pathogen-specific GST-X-tag fusion proteins as antigens17,18.
Full length or fragment viral, bacterial or parasitic antigens were expressed in E. coli fused to
an N-terminal GST domain and a C-terminal peptide tag for detection of full-length
expression and stored as cleared lysate10-12,14,16,19. Each antigen was loaded onto one distinct
bead set via in situ affinity purification of GST fusion proteins on glutathione-derivatised
beads. Subsequently, the bead sets (i.e. antigens) were mixed and simultaneously presented to
primary serum antibodies (at serum dilution 1:1000). Formed immunocomplexes were
detected using a biotinylated goat-α-human IgG secondary antibody and quantified in a
Luminex 200 flow cytometer via streptavidin-R-phycoerythrin as reporter dye. Per bead set,
at least 100 beads were measured and Median Fluorescence Intensities (MFI) were
calculated.
Individual infectious agent immunoassays were validated by comparing seropositivity and
seronegativity estimates from the Multiplex Serology platform against gold standard assays
using collections of anonymised, unlinked samples available as reference panels10-12,14,16.
These panels were also used to ensure that the performance of the agent-specific Multiplex
Serology assays conducted on non-magnetic beads were equivalent when combined in the
final Multiplex Serology panel tested on magnetic beads (Supplementary Methods,
Supplementary Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 3). Magnetic beads are required for
full scalability of the Multiplex Serology assay.
The serum samples were assayed in two equally sized batches, each assayed over a one week
period, including blind-spiked duplicates for 107 (1·1%) individuals to quantify within- and
between-batch variation (Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Figure 3).
Consistency of serostatus between baseline and repeat assessment samples were tested for

277 individuals to estimate seroconversion and seroreversion rates (Supplementary
Methods and Supplementary Table 5). Additionally, three reference control sera with
known reactivity patterns for the infectious agent panel were tested on each plate to verify
uniform plate handling (Supplementary Methods).

Statistical analysis
Statistical measures (sensitivity, specificity, Cohen’s kappa) for Multiplex Serology assays
using reference panel samples10-12,14,16 including 95% confidence intervals (CI) were
calculated using SAS 9·4.
During Multiplex Serology validation (Supplementary Figure 1) we defined cut-off values
distinguishing positive versus negative antibody responses against individual antigens based
on previously published analyses10-12,14,16,20-22. These antigen-specific seropositivity results
were subsequently combined using published algorithms to define overall seropositivity for
infectious agents (as discussed in more detail on the UK Biobank Data Showcase:
https://biobank.ctsu.ox.ac.uk/showcase/refer.cgi?id=1348).
The seroprevalence estimates for each infectious agent were compared to those expected for
European populations based on previously published data, determined through a PubMed
search using the terms ‘seroprevalence’, ‘prevalence’, ‘IgG’ or ‘antibody’ in addition to the
abbreviated or full name of the agent (Supplementary Methods).
Analyses were performed that tested associations between seropositivity (for individual
antigens) or overall infectious agent seropositivity (i.e. seroprevalence) as well as log10
transformed quantitative MFI antibody responses (i.e., seroreactivity) with environmental,
demographic and genetic exposures and disease outcomes. The variables used were defined
based on existing knowledge of such associations and are described in the Supplementary

Methods. The variables included sex, age (by decade), ethnicity, Townsend deprivation
index (TDI) quintiles, lifetime number of sexual partners (LSP in categories of ‘0’, ‘1’, ‘2-4’,
‘5-10’, ‘Greater than 10’) and self-report of ever same-sex intercourse (sameSI) using a
univariate regression model tested against the null (outcome ~ 1) using the likelihood ratio
test (R version 3·5·1). A chi-squared test for trend was used to test for linear upward or
downward trends of seroprevalence in the ordered quintiles of TDI. For those variables
demonstrating any evidence of association (P<0·01), multivariable logistic regression was
used to test for association whilst adjusting for other covariates with or without stratification
by sex. Similarly, associations of seropositivity with disease prevalence was performed using
either univariate logistic regression or, where sufficient power was present, multivariable
regression accounting for relevant covariates. Disease outcomes included cervical cancer,
multiple sclerosis (MS) and coeliac disease, selected owing to their known (cervical cancer
with HPV-16), potential (MS with EBV and CMV exposure) and unlikely (coeliac)
association with infection exposure. Disease outcomes were obtained through either selfreport, or cancer registry data (details of which are provided in the Supplementary
Methods).

Genetic analysis
Details of the generation of the genotype data have been described elsewhere23 and further
details are provided in the Supplementary Methods. To compare association statistics
against genetic association signals for multiple sclerosis, genotypes and case-control
phenotypes from the International Multiple Sclerosis dataset and GWAS analysis were
used24. Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles were imputed using genotype data available
from across the extended MHC region only (chromosome 6 base pair positions 25,500,00034,000,000 in genome build 37) using the SNP2HLA algorithm. Imputation and subsequent

association analyses were performed in PLINK 1·9 using logistic regression including sex
and age as fixed effect covariates, then statistics from individual countries were metaanalysed using a fixed effects model in METASOFT. Association and bivariate GREML
analyses of genetic data were undertaken using the GCTA software (version 1·26·0) for
directly genotyped variants. This uses a linear mixed model to control for cryptic relatedness
and to allow inclusion of all individuals irrespective of ethnic origin through the calculation
of a genetic relatedness matrix (GRM) incorporated as a random effect covariate. BOLTLMM was an equivalent software used for imputed data. Age and sex were included as fixed
effect covariates in all models.

Results
UKB Sample Overview
The baseline characteristics of the 9,695 UKB individuals included in the Multiplex Serology
study compared with the rest of the cohort with serum available for future analyses are shown
in Table 1. Of these individuals, 9,611 also had genetic data available for analyses following
quality control.
Seroprevalence estimates for each infectious agent, overall and in men and women
separately, are provided in Table 2. For all infectious agents, seroprevalence estimates were
within ranges consistent with those previously reported in European or North American
populations.

Associations between demographic factors and infectious agent seropositivity
We observed differences in seroprevalence estimates between males and females for 11
infectious agents, with 5 found to be higher in women (EBV, HHV-7, HPV-16, HPV-18 and
Ct) and 6 higher in men (VZV, HBV, HTLV-1, JCV and BKV and Hp). For all of the agents
where data from multiple antigens were used to calculate total infectious agent
seroprevalences, equivalent differences were observed in the same directions for the
individual antigens (Supplementary Table 6). The crude differences observed by sex for
these 11 infectious agents persisted following adjustment for age, TDI, self-reported
ethnicity, LSP and sameSI (Supplementary Table 7). We also observed significant
differences in seroprevalence by age (Figures 1A and 1B and Supplementary Table 8),
being strongest for HSV-1, CMV and Tg. Age was inversely associated with HPV-16, JCV
and BKV. For example, BKV seroprevalence was 97·0% (95% CI 96·1-97·9%) in men aged
40-49 years, and 93·0% (91·8-94·1%) in 60-69 year olds.

We observed significant differences in seroprevalences of multiple infectious agents by selfreported ethnicity (Figures 1C and 1D and Supplementary Table 9). For example, there
was a higher CMV seroprevalence in Asian (93·6%; 89·6-97·7%) compared to White
individuals (56·5%; 55·5-57·5%) and a higher seroprevalence of HBV in Black (23·4%;
16·4-30·4%) compared to White individuals (1·7%; 1·4-1·9%). We also found a higher
seroprevalence of several infectious agents known to be transmitted through sexual or close
physical contact with increasing LSP (HSV-1, HSV-2, EBV, HPV-16 and HPV-18 and Ct;
Figures 1E and 1F and Supplementary Table 10). We did not observe significant
associations between LSP and rare sexually transmitted infections such as HIV-1, HBV,
HCV or HTLV-1. We did however, observe statistically significant associations in men
reporting same sex intercourse for two of these infections (HBV, HIV-1) as well as Ct (Table
3). We observed an association between higher socio-economic deprivation and many
infectious agents including HSV-1, HSV-2, EBV, CMV, KSHV, HBV, Tg, Hp and Ct
(Supplementary Table 11). This was particularly striking for Hp in women where 25·7%
(22·2-29·2%) of women in the least deprived group had evidence of exposure compared to
42·8% (38·6-47·0%) in the most deprived group (Ptrend=4·3x10-11). Similarly, 19·7% (17·422·1%) of women in the first quintile had evidence of exposure to Ct compared to 34·8%
(31·9-37·7%) of women in the fifth quintile (Ptrend=2·5x10-16). The same trends were also
observed for males. However, with the exception of Hp, none of the associations remained
significant after adjusting for age, ethnic group and LSP.

Genetic associations with infectious agent antibody responses
We replicated three previously reported associations between human genetic variants and
antibody responses against infectious agents (Supplementary Table 12). All three
associations are with variants in the class II region of the MHC locus in the human genome.

Two variants (rs9269910 and rs9269268) were found to be associated with seropositivity for
JCV (P=6·9 x 10-22) and MCV (P=1·4x10-38) respectively, and another variant (rs6927022)
was associated with antibody levels against EBV EBNA1 antigen (P=9·5x10-91; Table 4).
Furthermore, we discovered a novel, statistically significant signal of association between
MHC variants (with the most significant association with the rs7197 variant) and antibody
response against the EBV viral capsid antigen (VCAp18; beta 0·04; 95% CI 0·03-0·05;
P=1·7x10-22, Supplementary Figure 5).

Associations between infectious agent exposure and health outcomes
We replicated the well-established association between HPV-16 L1 seropositivity
(considered a marker for cumulative exposure) and the risk of cervical intraepithelial
neoplasia (CIN; based on 131 cases; OR=2·65; 95% CI 1·51-4·66, P=0·001) and cervical
cancer (18 cases, OR=4·37; 95% CI 1·26-15·15, P=0·04). The association with CIN
remained significant after adjustment for age, ethnicity, LSP and TDI (OR=2·02; 95% CI
1·06-3·05; P=0·03; Figure 2). We found that all self-reported cases of MS disease in the
UKB subset (n=34) were seropositive for EBV infection as determined using either our
validated algorithm incorporating all four EBV antigens, or using VCAp18 seropositivity
alone (Figure 3A) which remained significant after adjustment for age, sex, ethnic group and
TDI (OR=5·3; 1·55-18·39; P=7·8x10-3). A similar, non-significant pattern of association was
observed for VCAp18 antibody levels (Figure 3B). We also observed an inverse association
with CMV seroprevalence and risk of MS that persisted after adjustment for the same
covariates (OR=0·39; 0·18-0·81; P=0·01).

Genetic Correlation Analysis
Using imputed HLA allele information we found that several alleles reported to be associated
with MS disease risk had similar statistics of association compared to the alleles associated

with antibody responses against the EBV antigens EBNA1 and VCAp18 (Figure 3C). To
determine the extent of association between EBV antigen response traits and MS risk we
calculated the genetic correlation between quantitative VCAp18 and EBNA1 antibody
response associations and MS case-control status using the largest available independent
case-control analysis of MS. We found statistically significant evidence of a positive genetic
correlation between MS risk and VCAp18 antibody response using variants across the MHC
region alone (rG=0·30, P=0·01) and a similar level of correlation using variants across the
entire genome (rG=0·21, P=0·02). We did not observe genetic correlation between EBNA1
antibody levels and MS (rG=0·09, P=0·41). Using data on coeliac disease (1,468 cases and
10,000 randomly selected controls) within UKB as a negative control we found no evidence
of genetic correlation between VCAp18 antibody responses and coeliac disease when tested
across the genome or across the MHC (rG = -0·09, P = 0·49).

Discussion
Seven viruses and one bacterial species are established causes of cancer. These and many
other species have been hypothesised to contribute to a range of NCDs including
cardiovascular and inflammatory conditions. Confirming and understanding the relationships
underlying such associations could have significant implications for public health and
facilitate the discovery of novel therapeutics. Here we present data from a Multiplex Serology
platform applied to a subset of a very large prospective cohort study. Our findings replicate
many established relationships, highlighting the validity of our data, and through these results
alongside novel associations we demonstrate the potential of the dataset for addressing
multiple questions relating to the epidemiology of infectious agents and biology underlying
subsequent disease.
Our seroprevalence estimates were consistent with previously published estimates in the UK
and Europe. Some of our seroprevalence estimates were on the higher limit of expectations.
For example, the Ct seroprevalence in women was approximately 25% in our study, and thus
significantly higher than in other studies using the microimmunofluorescence (MIF) assay or
major outer membrane protein (MOMP) peptide ELISA16,25. However, our seroprevalence
estimate was consistent with recent data from England based on the same antigen (pGP3) in
ELISA assays26. This highly immunogenic antigen is believed to be the most species-specific
marker of Ct that may provide a more accurate estimate of Ct exposure. We have previously
demonstrated high agreement of our Multiplex Serology pGP3 assay and the published pGP3
ELISA methods16.
Our observations of demographic associations with infectious agent seroprevalence, such as
those between LSP and sexually transmitted infections like Ct or HPV-16 further enhance the
reliability of the seroprevalence estimates derived from our Multiplex Serology panel.
Although we did not observe similarly significant associations between LSP and other

infections known to be sexually transmitted (HBV, HCV, HIV-1 and HTLV-1), these
infections are rare and the existing analysis may be underpowered to detect such associations.
Instead, the comprehensive data availability from UKB participants including sensitive
aspects of lifestyle meant that we could observe alternative relationships with sexual
behaviour reports such as sameSI with HBV, HIV-1 and Ct serostatus, thus increasing
confidence even in those infections that are rare within UKB.
Many of the demographic associations we observed, such as those with sex, age or
deprivation status, have been reported previously but are poorly understood; and such
associations may occur as a result of confounding. UKB offers the opportunity to clarify such
complex inter-relationships. For example, we were able to demonstrate clear associations
with age and CMV27, HSV-128 and Tg29 that are likely to be independent and not confounded
by other reported risk factors. Such infectious agents have repeatedly been shown to be
transmitted through behaviours in adulthood including close physical and sexual contact, and
animal exposure or diet as in the case of Tg. The associations of CMV, HBV and Tg we
observed with ethnicity were particularly striking. Although these associations remained
highly significant after adjustment for age, sex, LSP and TDI, it is likely that these
relationships occur as a combination of environmental and genetic factors in addition to the
increased likelihood of infectious agent exposure in other countries where participants of
alternative ethnicities may have lived when younger. In contrast, although we observed
significant associations between multiple infectious agents and deprivation, these associations
were no longer significant after adjustment for age, ethnicity and LSP. Such findings could
have significant implications for public health interventions for efforts to improve health
equality across strata of society.
The replication of a series of genetic associations with both seropositivity and quantitative
antibody responses further increases confidence in the validity of the dataset. Furthermore,

the discovery of a new signal of association with antibody responses against EBV VCAp18
highlights the potential of this dataset for novel discovery of genetic variant associations.
Associations of pathogen-specific antibodies with the MHC locus are mechanistically highly
plausible as variation in HLA genes may modulate an individual’s immune response to an
infection influencing susceptibility for and the ability to clear infections, and the magnitude
of antibody response.
Such genetic associations offer opportunities to improve our understanding of biological
mechanisms when interpreted alone. In addition, they can also be used to understand
relationships between infections and other NCDs through testing for the presence of shared
heritability. This is particularly relevant given the current availability of infectious agent data
for only a subset of the existing UKB. Although we had reasonable power within the UKB
subset to observe the well-recognised, causative association between HPV-16 seroprevalence
and CIN and cervical cancer30, testing for associations with small to moderate effect sizes is
difficult owing to the limited sample size. Nevertheless, when testing a hypothetical
association that has long been speculated to be causal, we did still observe differences in the
magnitude and seroprevalence of EBV antibody responses in patients with self-reported MS
compared to those without MS in directions consistent with previous reports5. By comparing
genetic association signals derived from the antibody response in the UKB subset against
signals generated from an independently recruited case-control analysis of MS, we observed
a significant degree of genetic correlation between EBV VCAp18 antibody responses and MS
risk. Our estimation with an rG between 0·2 and 0·3 both across the MHC and the entire
genome is in line with previous reports and has been interpreted as evidence in favour of a
causal relationship between EBV and MS31,32. However, since the majority of this correlation
will be driven by the MHC region well known to demonstrate significant levels of pleiotropy
(i.e. a single genetic variant may be associated with multiple traits) it is not possible to

definitively exclude other confounders that may better explain this relationship. These
confounders may indeed include other infectious agents with similar associations across the
MHC. Reassuringly we observed no association with coeliac disease that was included as a
negative control.
Although we have demonstrated a range of potential utilities for the data generated from the
Multiplex Serology panel, it is important to recognise the limitations of our approach.
Multiplex Serology is an epidemiological screening tool designed to detect cumulative (i.e.
past or present) exposure and thus may be less sensitive or specific than assays used in
clinical diagnosis. Moreover, the multiplex nature of the assay does not allow for the
optimisation of assay conditions for each and every infectious agent as demonstrated by the
variation in validation statistics (e.g. as seen for Tg). Nevertheless, even for Tg, we were still
able to observe robust epidemiological associations consistent with the literature, reinforcing
the high quality of the data for epidemiological analyses. Irrespective of all of the above, the
availability of additional biomaterials (such as saliva and buffy coats) from baseline and
follow-up sampling in the UKB participants offers significant future opportunities. For
example, it may be possible to undertake complementary assays (such as nucleotide-based
detection systems) to add data about acute infections in individuals identified as seropositive
for either prior exposure or carriage using data from the Multiplex Serology panel.
We show that our Multiplex Serology panel offers an attractive validated approach to identify
novel and confirm previously reported associations between infectious agents and a range of
demographic factors and genetic variants that may influence the risk of chronic disease. In
time, with further cohort maturation and investigation by the scientific community, these data
are likely to have significant impact on our understanding of the burden of infectious agents
and their sequelae, which will in turn inform future public health strategies.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Multiple epidemiological studies have estimated the burden of prior exposure or chronic
carriage with a variety of infectious agents. By searching PubMed using criteria as listed in
the Supplementary Methods we found examples of such cross-sectional studies including
the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the Detroit
Neighbourhood Health Study, the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis and Add Health in
the USA, and national surveillance systems implemented in various countries including the
UK. Such studies have led to an increased appreciation of disease risk across communities
and populations, and in some cases have contributed data in support of infection-disease
associations. However, cross-sectional studies cannot determine directionality of such
infection-disease associations and are therefore difficult to interpret. Seroepidemiology data
from large, broadly characterised prospective cohort studies such as UK Biobank (UKB) and
the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC) offer opportunities
to investigate the temporality of associations between past exposure to infectious agents and
subsequent disease risk. Despite the value of such cohort study designs, large-scale serology
testing has rarely been undertaken owing to financial and logistical barriers and a tendency to
undertake nested case-control analyses to answer specific questions. Furthermore, very few
studies have considered infections that are either very rare or very common in populations
owing to consequences in terms of statistical power. Some infections, such as HIV-1, have
additional ethical barriers to surveillance and detection that confer a risk of selection bias
dependent on the populations amenable to study.

Added value of this study
This study demonstrates the utility of a scalable Multiplex Serology platform to measure
antibodies against 45 antigens from 20 infectious agents in a random subset of 9,695 UKB
participants. Our seroprevalence estimates fall within expected UK age-sex distributions for
all tested infectious agents. The associations observed between seroprevalence and sex,
ethnicity and sexual behaviour for multiple infectious agents not only serve to validate the
utility of the panel but should also guide public health initiatives to reduce the burden of
infections, and thus their immediate symptoms and subsequent disease sequelae. The
associations with human genetic variation similarly offer reassurances in terms of crosscohort reproducibility, and provides an opportunity to discover novel genetic associations,
such as that observed between human leukocyte antigen complex variation and EBV
VCAp18 antigen responses that offer biological insights into disease pathogenesis research
and prevention. If, as planned, data on infectious agents were available for all 500,000 UK
Biobank individuals, this resource would represent a unique opportunity to understand how
exposure to a range of infectious agents influences subsequent disease risk and how host
genetic factors influence these relationships.

Implications of all the available evidence
The work presented here is the first phase of infectious agent exposure characterisation in
UKB and has generated comprehensive data that is now publically available. It represents an
exemplar of the types of analyses possible using the wealth of data collected from all UKB
participants. The seroprevalence estimates offer opportunities to understand differences by
demographics highlighting, for example, the importance of sexual behaviour in disease risk,
whilst explaining differences by deprivation status through combinations of age, ethnicity and
sexual behaviour. Furthermore, the availability of quantitative seroresponses, as highlighted

by the correlation between EBV antigen responses and MS, offers opportunities to estimate
the magnitude of disease risk. These investigations will help inform public health initiatives,
and generate novel hypotheses for future mechanistic studies.
