Abstract

26

Background: Off-label drug use (OLU) reflects a perceived unmet medical need, which is common in

27

oncology. Cancer drugs are often highly expensive and their reimbursement is a challenge for many

health care systems. OLU is frequently regulated by reimbursement restrictions. For evidence-based

2

health care, treatment ought to be reimbursed if there is sufficient clinical evidence for treatment

3

benefit independently of patient factors not related to the treatment indication. However, little is known

4

about the reality of OLU reimbursement and its association with the underlying clinical evidence. Here

5

we aim to investigate the relationship of reimbursement decisions with the underlying clinical evidence.

6

Methods/ Design: We extract patient characteristics and details on treatment and reimbursement of

7

cancer drugs from over 3000 patients treated in three Swiss hospitals. We systematically search for

8

clinical trial evidence on benefits associated with OLU in the most common indications. We will

9

describe the prevalence of OLU in Switzerland and its reimbursement in cancer care, and use

10

multivariable logistic regression techniques to investigate the association of approval/rejection of a

11

reimbursement requests to the evidence on treatment effects and to further factors, including type of

12

drug, molecular predictive markers and the health insurer.

13

Discussion: Our study will provide a systematic overview and assessment of OLU and its

14

reimbursement reality in Switzerland. We may provide a better understanding of the access to cancer

15

care that is regulated by health insurers and we hope to identify factors that determine the level of

16

evidence-based cancer care in a highly diverse Western health care system.

17

Keywords: Off-label use, evidence-based health care, reimbursement, cancer therapy

18

Background

19

Drugs prescribed in routine medical care typically require licensing and approval for defined

20

indications by health authorities, for example the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA),

21

the European Medicines Agency (EMA), or Swissmedic (SM) in Switzerland. Indications usually

22

contain restrictions in drug usage to a disease in a certain setting, line of treatment, and co-treatment

23

with another drug. Off-label use (OLU) means using the drug outside the approved indication. In

24

particular in cancer therapy, where new agents emerge frequently, OLU is common practice (1).

25

International estimates range from 13% to 71% of adults receiving off-label therapy during cancer

26

treatment (1), with about 30% in Switzerland (2). When new evidence for clinical benefit of a drug

27

emerges, OLU allows usage before the indication is formally approved and labelled (3). One example

28

is the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) directed agent trastuzumab, which is

29

approved standard treatment for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer (4,5). Success of

1

trastuzumab in HER2-positive breast cancer suggested benefits for other HER2-overexpressing or

2

amplifying tumors as well, for example gastric cancer. Indeed, in 2010 a randomized controlled trial

3

(RCT) showed better survival for patients with advanced gastric cancer overexpressing HER2 (6).

4

However, it took another year until a formal approval for this new indication was granted by the FDA

5

and in the meantime, patients could only receive this promising treatment via OLU. But

6

counterexamples exist. Drugs being approved in certain cancer indications may not work in others, as

7

shown for irinotecan and bevacizumab in colorectal cancer. Both drugs are effective and approved in

8

the metastatic setting (7,8), however, in the adjuvant setting, no benefit was found (9,10); such

9

example emphasizes that OLU may do harm to patients.

10

OLU is frequently regulated by reimbursement restrictions, because cancer drugs are often highly

11

expensive and their reimbursement is a challenge for many health care systems. This may reduce

12

costs, but to allow evidence-based health care, reimbursement should primarily be based on evidence.

13

The Swiss healthcare system is highly diverse. Across the 26 cantons with diverse care structures and

14

local regulation there are 57 statutory health insurers (as of Oct 2018) (11). They base their

15

reimbursement policies on decisions of the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH), which

16

determines the drugs and indications that have to be reimbursed. For intended OLU, an upfront

17

request for reimbursement to the patient’s health insurer is mandatory. These reimbursement requests

18

are then appraised by reviewers (medical examiners) commissioned by the statutory health insurers,

19

who give recommendations on acceptance of the request with subsequent access to that treatment.

20

They may use various tools (12) to guide their decisions on whether to approve or disapprove the

21

reimbursement for OLU and are supposed to consider the available clinical evidence but also the

22

individual clinical circumstances and patient characteristics.

23

Although these tools are recommended, it is neither mandatory nor transparent how they would be

24

applied. There is no structured and transparent systematic framework specifically regulating the case-

25

by-case decisions. There is also no empirical information on the reimbursement reality, which would

26

be a prerequisite for quality control and potential improvement of this approach. Overall, due to the

27

high costs of oncology drugs, access of Swiss patients to drugs used in off-label indications is

28

currently based on intransparent processes.

29

Here we describe the rationale and design of the OLU-Cancer project as part of the Comparative

30

Effectiveness of Innovative Treatments (CEIT) project (13). The CEIT project evaluates the generation

of clinical trial evidence for novel drug treatments, in the case of OLU using a large sample of patients

2

to provide empirical evidence on access to OLU in a highly diverse Western health care system.

3

Methods/ Design

4

Our main objective is to investigate the relationship of reimbursement decisions to the underlying

5

clinical evidence on patient benefits and subsequent access to cancer drugs. We also aim to assess

6

the role of further factors that may influence the reimbursement. Finally, we aim to describe the

7

prevalence of OLU and its reimbursement in cancer patients within the Swiss healthcare system.

8

The project is organized in three phases: First, we identify, extract and classify the data on OLU from

9

patient records (electronic and paper-based). Second, we determine the clinical evidence using rapid

10

review techniques, standard approaches for evidence synthesis, and review-of-review methods.

11

Finally, we combine the results of both phases to address our research objectives.

12

I Reimbursement reality

13

Eligibility Criteria

14

In August 2018, we started to screen patient records for reimbursement requests at three collaborating

15

major hospitals, all being tertiary referral centers: University Hospital Basel (Department of Medical

16

Oncology and Department of Hematology), University Hospital Berne (Department of Medical

17

Oncology), and a large general district hospital in St. Gallen (Department of Oncology/Hematology).

18

We screen all patients who had their first consultation between January 2015 and July 2018. Patients

19

were eligible if they have a malignant disease (solid or hematological) and receive systemic anti-

20

cancer treatment with a drug or biologic. Patients with at least one reimbursement request issued by

21

the treating physician will be included in data extraction (see figure 1). We exclude patients who have

22

only a one-time appointment for a second opinion, whose disease is not treated with drugs but surgery

23

or radiotherapy only, or for whom no reimbursement request was issued.

24

Sample size considerations

25

Based on a previous study on OLU in Switzerland (2), we assume that at least one reimbursement

26

request for OLU has been issued for around 20% to 30% of eligible patients. In addition, preliminary

27

data from the three sites revealed a proportion of 20% OLU. To account for the uncertainty on the

28

actual frequency of OLU requests (both approved and disapproved), we consider a range of plausible

4

1

proportions (15%, 20%, and 25%) of OLU among all patients. To achieve a high precision of

2

estimates, we plan to screen around 3000 eligible patients. This which would result in the following

3

frequencies and proportions with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for OLU per patient:

4

-

450/3000 (15%, 95% CI: 13.8% to 16.3%)

5

-

600/3000 (20%, 95% CI: 18.6% to 21.5%)

6

-

900/3000 (30%, 95% CI: 28.4% to 31.7%)

7

We find all of them acceptable. To determine the actual proportion of disapproved reimbursement

8

requests for OLU is a central objective of this project, however, based on preliminary data from this

9

project and data from a single department that has implemented monitoring of its reimbursement

10

requests since 2017, we assume that around 30% of OLU requests are disapproved. Considering the

11

above-mentioned range of plausible frequencies of OLU requests, this would result in the following

12

frequencies and proportions with 95% CIs for disapprovals per OLU request:

13

-

135/450 (30%, 95% CI 25.8% to 34.5%)

14

-

180/600 (30%, 95% CI 26.4% to 33.9%)

15

-

270/900 (30%, 95% CI 27.0% to 33.1%)

16

Thus, we consider a sample of 3000 eligible patients as sufficient to determine the prevalence of OLU,

17

the prevalence of disapproved OLU, and also for our planned multivariable regression modelling (see

18

III).

19

Extraction of patient-related health and reimbursement data

20

To assess the prevalence of OLU requests, we will screen patient records of all eligible patients for

21

any reimbursement request. For those patients, we will extract patient demographics, disease and

22

treatment details, and information on reimbursement requests and correspondence with the respective

23

health insurer. This information will be stored in a relational database that we generated for this

24

purpose. Details of the collected variables are available in the appendix (Table A1).

25

Definition and categorization of OLU

26

We will define OLU as any drug use that does not agree with the Swissmedic drug label. We will also

27

assess unlicensed use (drug marketing is not licensed by Swissmedic for Switzerland, but approved

28

by the FDA or EMA), and compassionate use (drug is neither licensed by the FDA, EMA nor

29

Swissmedic) (see table 1). We will further sub-categorize OLU according to disease, intended

Timeline of licensing and approval

6

Licensing of a cancer drug often starts with a single indication and, over time, additional indications

7

are approved. Drug labels and on- and off-label status may change over time. We will systematically

8

record the approval dates of all requested drugs for each disease and new indication in a structured

9

database. We will identify these dates by searching for publications and press releases of Swissmedic

10

and the FOPH to develop a timeline for each drug and its label changes.

11

Two trained oncologists/hematologists will independently determine the OLU status for each request

12

at the time of the request. Disagreements will be solved by discussion. Because the off-label status is

13

time-dependent, we will match the date of the OLU request with the approval-timeline of the respective

14

drug label.

15

OLU prevalence

16

We will estimate the prevalence of OLU and the frequency of reimbursement. Specifically, we will

17

investigate:

18

●

The frequency and proportion of all reimbursement requests among all eligible patients treated

19

for a malignant disease.

20

○

21

The frequencies and proportions of OLU, compassionate and unlicensed use among all
reimbursement requests.

Unit of calculation is the individual request. We will re-evaluate all these factors in subgroups of

13

requests clustered by the patient’s health insurer (insurer as per index date of first reimbursement

14

request).

15

II Clinical evidence

16

We will systematically evaluate the evidence for treatment effects on overall survival (OS) and

17

progression-free survival (PFS) in OLU situations.

18

Literature search

19

For the most common off-label indications, we will generate overarching clinical questions following

20

the PICO structure (14), composed of population (disease, treatment setting, treatment line),

21

intervention (drug, single agent or combination), control (any comparator), and outcome (PFS or OS).

22

Most common OLU indications and resulting PICO questions will be derived from the extracted patient

23

data (for details see appendix, table A1).

24

We will use rapid review techniques to identify systematic reviews (SRs) of RCTs addressing these

25

questions. If there are no eligible systematic reviews available, we will directly search for RCTs. We

26

will search PubMed and use pertinent keywords and subject headings for cancer sites and generic

27

drug terms. Standard search filters for SRs and RCTs will be used (15). In general, we will include

28

publications reporting treatment effects on PFS and OS that are published in English or German. No

29

further limits will be applied. Further evidence will be sought by backward citation chasing (16)

1

(screening the reference lists of included publications). Search strategies will be created by an

2

information specialist and will be peer-reviewed.

3

We will additionally evaluate literature provided by the requesting physician and consult guidelines

4

provided by the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) and verify if our search identifies any

5

RCTs not found in our systematic literature searches (17).

6

Study selection and data extraction

7

Overall, for feasibility and efficiency reasons, we use the SRs primarily to identify pertinent RCTs and

8

their results. In a first step, we will select the most recent systematic review publication identified in the

9

SR search that is covering the PICO. We will always prefer a recent Cochrane Review due to the

10

comparatively high methodological quality and standardized and transparent reporting. We only

11

consider SRs that are sufficiently transparent in reporting key methods. This means, we include only

12

SRs that adequately report the PRISMA items “identification”, “screening”, “eligibility”, “included” (18).

13

We deem reporting adequate if it would let us replicate the search for RCTs. Selection of SRs will be

14

done independently by two reviewers and confirmed by a third reviewer in case of uncertainty.

15

In a second step, we will identify the pertinent RCTs included in eligible SRs. From each eligible SR

16

article, we extract bibliographic details of the SR, search details (search date, databases), and any

17

RCT and corresponding publication matching our PICO of interest. From each pertinent RCT article,

18

we extract bibliographic information and the date of publication (earliest available: online or printed if

19

printed publication was available before published online). We will extract the treatment effects directly

20

from the RCT publication, based on the main analysis of the intention to treat population (ITT), where

21

available. The rationale behind this is that we want to depict the evidence as it was at the time of

22

request. In case of multiple reported effect estimates, we prefer that one clearly labeled as

23

prespecified, main analysis, or first reported in the abstract (acknowledging possible spin by relying on

24

prominently reported results for consistency, which will be addressed in sensitivity analyses).

25

If no appropriate SR can be identified, we will apply the same procedure to the RCT search.

26

Evidence synthesis and overview

27

We will synthesize the evidence by using cumulative meta-analysis techniques (19,20). We will

28

combine all trials on the same PICO question and determine for the time point, when new evidence is

29

available, the current knowledge on clinical benefits (that is the summary treatment effect estimate for

1

OS and PFS from all RCTs up to that point). This allows us to describe the evolution of clinical

2

knowledge from RCTs in any oncological off-label indication with clinical trial evidence over time.

3

We will categorize the available evidence on patient-relevant treatment benefits from RCTs (summary

4

treatment effect from meta-analyses) for each drug and indication into:

5

1.

The combined analysis shows OS benefit (nominal statistical significance).

6

2.

The combined analysis shows PFS benefit (nominal statistical significance), but no OS benefit.

7

3.

No indication for benefit or harm (no nominal statistically significant OS or PFS effect).

8

4.

Inconclusive (nominal statistical treatment benefit for OS but significant harm for PFS or vice

9

versa).

10

5.

The combined analysis shows OS harm.

11

6.

The combined analysis shows PFS harm.

12

7.

Unclear (no randomized trial evidence available).

13

III Contrasting Evidence to Reimbursement Reality

14

Finally, we will investigate the association between the reimbursement decision for OLU and clinical

15

evidence using multilevel multivariable logistic regression. Furthermore, we aim to identify other

16

factors than clinical evidence explaining any potential discrepancies between clinical evidence and

17

reimbursement.

18

Association of reimbursement to evidence

19

We will use multilevel multivariable logistic regression to investigate the association between the

20

clinical evidence supporting OLU and the likelihood for reimbursement of OLU. We have chosen

21

multilevel modelling, because requests are clustered by patients and health insurers. We will

22

condense the seven categories of clinical evidence into three groups (A-C) and summarize treatment

23

benefits:

24

A)

Clear patient-relevant benefit (corresponds to category 1)

25

B)

Potential patient-relevant benefit (corresponds to category 2)

26

C)

No proven patient-relevant benefit (corresponds to category 3-7)

27

We will determine the category for the time when each reimbursement was requested. Category A will

28

be the reference for this categorical variable, which is the independent variable in the regression

29

analysis. Rejection of a request for reimbursement of OLU will be the dependent binary variable

1

(rejected versus approved). The association will be expressed as odds ratios (OR) with 95%

2

confidence intervals, with an OR>1 indicating a higher likelihood for the reimbursement to be rejected

3

by the health insurer. We hypothesize that the risk for rejection will be higher in situations of category

4

C than B and higher for category B than A.

5

The above-mentioned consideration of time points in our data collection and analysis will allow us to

6

investigate potential time lags between occurrence of new evidence for treatment benefit and

7

Swissmedic approval/labeling. In such periods, patients can only access new drugs through OLU

8

reimbursement by the health insurer or extended access programs by the respective drug

9

manufacturer. However, the latter is completely at the discretion of the drug manufacturer, therefore,

10

requesting OLU from the health insurer is often the only way to receive the drug. We will therefore

11

additionally investigate the following:

12

● The time lag between availability of evidence for treatment benefit (category A or B) and

13

approval of the drug by Swissmedic. This time will be calculated from the earliest date of trial

14

publication to the date of approval by Swissmedic.

15

● The number of cases in this time period, for each indication, in which an OLU request was

16

issued and the number of these requests rejected for reimbursement, although evidence for

17

treatment benefit (category A or B) was available.

18

Association of reimbursement to other factors

19

To investigate whether patient or disease characteristics that are not related to the treatment indication

20

influence the risk for rejection of request for OLU reimbursement, we will perform multilevel

21

multivariable logistic regression analysis including seven variables. These variables are:

22

1.

Sex (categorical variable: male vs. female)

23

2.

Age (continuous variable)

24

3.

Presence of molecular predictive marker (binary variable; we anticipate that presence of a

25

marker lowers the risk of rejection because of the availability of a drug target independent of the

26

disease)

27

4.

Disease type (categorical variable: solid vs. hematological malignancies; we anticipate that

28

chances for reimbursement are higher for hematological malignancies because there are often

29

only OLU treatment options available for hematological malignancies)

1

5.

Type of treatment (categorical variable: immunotherapy [checkpoint inhibition] vs. all others; we

2

anticipate that chances for reimbursement are higher for immunotherapy because this drug

3

class has recently been approved for several tumor entities)

4

6.

5
6
7

Orphan drug status (binary variable; we anticipate that chances for reimbursement are higher
for an orphan drug/indication because there are less treatment options available)

7.

Tumor incidence (continuous variable; we anticipate that chances for reimbursement are higher
for rare diseases because there are less treatment options available)

8

We assume that there is less evidence for rare diseases. However, such patients may often be

9

particularly in need for OLU. We will rank the entities by incidence according to global cancer statistics

10

as issued by the WHO (21) and label orphan drugs according to Swissmedic (22). For sensitivity

11

analyses, we will consider the orphan drug designation as used by the FDA (23).

12

Handling of missing data

13

We will report frequencies (proportions) of missing data of all independent and dependent variables.

14

The primary analysis will be based on complete cases, but we will use multiple imputations for missing

15

data for a sensitivity analysis using all cases (24).

16

Software

17

We will use Ninox (https://ninoxdb.de/de/) for managing data and generating relational databases, R

18

for data cleaning and most statistical analyses (The R Project for Statistical Computing, https://www.r-

Discussion

22

This study will provide a comprehensive assessment of OLU and its reimbursement reality in

23

Switzerland, a systematic overview of the comparative effectiveness of OLU in cancer care, and a

24

thorough investigation on the association between OLU reimbursement and the underlying evidence

25

from clinical research. By publishing this rationale and design paper, we intend to minimize ambiguity

26

and increase transparency concerning our study (25).

27

To our knowledge, this will be the first study targeting OLU in such extent and level of detail. We will

28

use transparent sources and apply systematic and reproducible search strategies. The collaboration

with three hematology/oncology departments across Switzerland will provide us with a sufficient

2

number of patients to gain a representative sample for our planned investigations.

3

We will highly depend on the comprehensiveness of documentation in patient files, but we expect that

4

the documentation of correspondence with the health insurer will at least be routinely included in the

5

patient files due to the substantial economic and administrative impact.

6

This study will provide a comprehensive overview on access to off-label treatments in a highly

7

developed country, characterized by a fragmented and expensive health care system. It will help to

8

determine if access to perceived unmet medical needs is based on clinical evidence and if the Swiss

9

health care system employs principles of evidence-based health care for OLU. We hope to reveal

10

potential inequalities in access, to better understand and ultimately improve the quality of

11

reimbursement decisions for cancer patients.
