Abstract
Background: The patients suffering of the rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder (RBD) are in
high risk of developing a neurodegenerative disorder, most frequently from the group of alphasynucleinopathies, such as Parkinson's disease (PD), Dementia with Lewy Bodies (DLB) or multiple
system atrophy (MSA). The definitive diagnosis of RBD is based on polysomnographic investigation.
Actigraphy is much easier to perform and reflects condition in patient’s home environment.

The aims: The aim of this study was to find suitable biomarkers for RBD, which can be detectable by
actigraphic recording.

Methods: High resolution actigraphic recording (MotionWatch, CamNtech ltd.) and confirming
polysomnographic recording was performed on 45 RBD patients, 30 patients with other sleep-related
motor disorders and 20 healthy controls. Each individual file was analysed by software testing for
amount of sleep (MotionWare 1.1.20) and secondly for periodic motor activity (PLMS analysis
1.0.16). The 13-item patient self-rating RBD screening questionnaire (RBD-SQ) translated to Czech
language was also used for screening purposes. We used an RBD-SQ score of five points as a positive
test result, as suggested by the original publication of the scale.

Results: When using the actigraphic sleep detection, we encountered significant differences mostly
on non-dominant hand, related to sleep fragmentation - most notably increased percentage of Short
immobile bouts (47.0% vs. 28.0%, p<0.0001), increased Fragmentation index (72.5 vs. 40.7,
p<0.0001) and decreased percentage of Sleep efficiency (72.1% vs. 86.8%, p<0.0001)in RBD subjects
compared to other sleep disorders and controls. When analyzing periodic motor activity, we also
found surprisingly more periodic hand movements (p=0.028, corrected for multiple testing), but
differences on lower extremities using either measurement were not significant. The discrimination
function based on RBD-SQ and Short immobile bouts % could allocate correctly the RBD status in
87.6% of cases with Wilks Lambda 0.435 and p<0.0001.

Conclusion:In our single-center study in patients from the Czech population, we found that
actigraphic recording from upper extremities shows consistently more prominent sleep
fragmentation in RBD patients compared to other sleep diagnoses or healthy controls. Actigraphy
may be useful in broader screening for RBD.

Motor activities may vary in intensity and complexity from short jerky limb movements to complex
motor behavior and usually correlate with simultaneously experienced dream content. Nature of
such dreams is mostly unpleasant, patient is often placed into position of a victim, usually attacked or

2) Replication phase – the sample consisted of 29 previously diagnosed RBD patients (mean age
69.9y, SD 7.8y, 89.6% males). RBD diagnosis was established by VPSG according to valid international
criteria

, maximum time from the diagnosis was 3 years. Each patient included in Replication

sample underwent actigraphic recording at home for multiple nights (minimal number of nights 2,
maximal number of nights 6, mean number of nights 4.8, modus 6). Recording device was worn only
on non-dominant hand. Participants were instructed to fill the sleep diary after every nocturnal sleep
period. The items included in the sleep diary were as follows: 1) time of going to bed; 2) time of
falling asleep; 3) number and duration of arousal episodes during the night; 4) time of waking up; 5)
time of getting up. Patients from the Replication sample were also asked to complete the RBD-SQ.

3) Combined phase – Actigraphic and clinical data pooled from both discovery and replication phases
were analyzed in order to enrich the sample by more RBD patients. This sample consisted of 45 RBD
patients (mean age 66.8y, SD 9.7y, 86.6% males), 30 other sleep diagnoses and 20 healthy volunteers
(same as in the Discovery phase).

1) Time in bed (TIB); 2) Sleep efficiency %, characterized as a ratio of actual time spent in sleep to
time spent in bed, expressed as a percentage (SE %); 3) Wake bouts, defined as the number of
awakening episodes during the recorded night (WB); 4) Mobile time %, expressed as a motor activity
percentage of the assumed sleep time (MT %); 5) Short immobile bouts %, equals to the number of
none registered activity episodes less than or equal to one minute divided by the total of none
registered activity episodes, expressed as a percentage (SIB%); 6) Mean nonzero activity epoch,
characterized as the number of activity counts divided by the number of episodes of nonzero motor
activity (MNAE); 7) Fragmentation index, reflects the disintegration of sleep cycle and is calculated as
the sum of the MT % and the SIB % (FI). Each actigraphic file was secondly analyzed for periodic

In our study, RBD-SQ could allocate RBD status with 95.2% sensitivity and 71.7% specificity with cutoff of 5 points. Actigraphic detection of RBD using only SIB % as a main discriminator, had sensitivity
and specificity of 86.6%and 66.0%(for cut-off 31%), 84.4% and 80.0% (for cut-off 35%), respectively.
Diagnostic accuracy based on combination of actigraphy (expressed by SIB%) and RBD-SQ (including
only subjects with RBD-SQ>4) could identify RBD with estimated sensitivity of 90.0% (for cut-off 31%)
/ 87.5%(for cut-off 35%) and specificity of 81.8%, respectively. AUC of the combined screening
method was 0.845.When filtering all subjects for the SIB %> 31%, the sensitivity and specificity of
subsequent use of RBD-SQ is 100% and 83.3%. When using both cut-offs of SIB %>31 and RBD-SQ>4
for positivity of screening and all other cases were regarded as negative, the sensitivity and
specificity was85.7% and 97.4%, respectively. Comparative results of all ROC analysis including
confidence intervals are presented in table 3.Complete results of ROC analysis are provided in the
Supplementary material.

We performed stepwise discrimination analysis using all parameters significantly different between
RBD and non-RBD subjects. In the first step we had to exclude Wake bouts and Mobile time
percentage for their high correlation with Sleep efficiency %. All parameters with F lower than two
were subsequently removed. In the end of the analysis RBD-SQ and SIB % were the only remaining
parameters in the model.

The discrimination function based on RBD-SQ and SIB % could correctly allocate the RBD status in
87.6% of cases with Wilks Lambda 0.435 and p<0.0001.

There are eight of total 29 actigraphic recordings from the Replication sample which had multiple
night recoding and showed at least one night with SIB %below the cut off value of 31%. Out of those
eight cases, in two RBD patients the SIB % values during all recorded nights were below the cut off
value of 31%. In six patients, at least one of the recorded nights had SIB % value above 31%.

assessed sleep fragmentation - in our study best represented by SIB%.

Patient’s perception of sleep disturbance is an essential feature in the current diagnostics of RBD.
Nevertheless, 44% of patients suffering of RBD are not aware of occurring dream-enactment
behaviour. This may be due to absence of the bed partner or due to unimpaired quality of sleep in
the 70% of RBD patients

11

. Patient’s lack of self-awareness of RBD symptoms leads to not seeking

medical attention and makes potential therapeutic intervention impossible. Therefore, development
of unbiased and widely available screening method for RBD in general population is of high
importance. Additionally, it is relevant to avoid false negative screening results and to reduce the
number of eventually negative VPSG, at the same time.

In our study, conducted analysis of actigraphs showed notable differences in selected actigraphic
parameters between groups throughout all phases of the study. The intergroup differences were
sufficiently significant to distinguish patients with assessed diagnosis of RBD from the other study
participants, comprising patients with other sleep-related motor disorders and healthy controls. The
most prominent differences were encountered on non-dominant upper extremity and were highly
related to increased sleep fragmentation in the RBD patients. In accordance with the results of
statistical analysis, we determined SIB %as a best actigraphic discriminator of RBD status. SIB %is
stable when comparing patient’s home vs. sleep laboratory recording and is an equivalent to Short
burst inactivity index

41

.

Previous studies made significant progress in evaluating the actigraphy as a screening tool. Findings
of Louter et al. showed that using Total wake bouts as a main actigraphic discriminator could identify
RBD only in 20.1% of the cases. Such sensitivity is not sufficient for the clinical screening

40

. More

recent study of Stefani et al. used subjective expert-based analysis of actigraphic record, visually
scoring occurrence and amplitude of wrist activity during the nocturnal sleep period. Raters were
provided basic clinical data and actigraphs were subsequently compared with VPSG for association
with selected polysomnoghraphic parameters. Visual actigraphy analysis in combination with patientadministered questionnaires had estimated 85%-95%

sensitivity and 79%-91%

specificity

41

. This

proposed combination of methods shows good overall sensitivity and specificity at the expense of
easy scoring, potentially. Visual scoring of long term actigraphic record would possibly be timeconsuming and would require well-trained sleep medicine expert. Despite its other qualities, these

According to our findings, single-wrist actigraphy using SIB % could identify RBD cases among other
sleep-related diagnoses and healthy controls with estimated sensitivity and specificity of 86.6% and
66.0% (for cut-off 31%), 84.4% and 80.0% (for cut-off 35%), respectively.

In our study, RBD-SQ as a routinely used screening instrument, could allocate RBD status with higher
sensitivity of 95.2%, but with lower specificity of 71.7%, when compared to SIB %.When testing both
methods combined, we used two different RBD screening approaches: 1)using positive result of RBDSQ (cut off 5 points) as a criterion for subsequent actigraphy recording and 2) using positive result of
actigraphy as a criterion for following RBD-SQ administration. Further research consequently showed
that both combinations of methods have preferable screening test characteristics. When usingRBDSQ followed by actigraphic recording, we estimated 90.0%sensitivityfor cut-off value of 31% and
87.5% sensitivity for cut-off value of 35%, respectively. Specificity of 81.8% increased and was equal
in both cut-off values. When using actigraphy first with subsequent administration of RBD-SQ, we
estimated sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 83.3% (for cut off 31%), 100% and 71.4% (for cut off
35%), respectively. Our study showed that conjunction of quantitative actigraphy analysis and RBDSQhas sufficiently high sensitivity and promotes specificity of screening for RBD. We suggest the
bestSIB % cut-off value of 31%, when combined with the positive result of RBD-SQ.

There are possible study limitations which must be noted. Majority of the study participants was
represented by the males. In spite of this fact, sex ratio was similar in all groups and showed no
significant intergroup differences. Another possible limitation of the study was that patients with

Moreover,

opinion,

psychoactive medication should not be able to induce the deposition of alpha-synuclein de novo.

Potential strengths of our study were as follows: 1) relatively high number of patients diagnosed with
various sleep-related motor disorders; 2) all study participants, including healthy controls, underwent
standardized VPSG examination; 3) all participants included in the Discovery phase underwent VPSG

We would like to point out potential extended use of actigraphy in the future diagnostic process. It is
possible

that pooled

actigraphic

recordings from various centers might be

suitable

for machine

learning approaches. Compact design and comfortable use could make actigraphy an ideal screening
tool in the general population, not only in the population in a high risk of RBD. Moreover, existing
smartphone gadgets are able to record similar type

of data as actigraphs. Every person is in a

potential risk of developing a neurodegenerative disorder and people above 60 are at higher risk, as

Conclusion
We proved our research hypothesis that automatic quantitative analysis of actigraphic recoding in
combination with RBD-SQ is accurate, highly sensitive and specific method for the detection of RBD.
We suggest that quantitative actigraphy and RBD-SQ combined provide balanced ratio of required
sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, we suggest introduction of single-wrist actigraphic recording
into the RBD screening algorithm.
