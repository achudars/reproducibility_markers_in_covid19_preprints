ABSTRACT

Background: Genetic variation can predispose to disease both through (i) monogenic risk
variants in specific genes that disrupt a specific physiologic pathway and have a large effect on
disease risk and (ii) polygenic risk that involves large numbers of variants of small effect that
affect many different pathways. Few studies have explored the interaction between monogenic
risk variants and polygenic risk.

Methods: We identified monogenic risk variants and calculated polygenic scores for three
diseases, coronary artery disease, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, in three study
populations — case-control cohorts for coronary artery disease (UK Biobank; N=12,879) and
breast cancer (Color Genomics; N=19,264), and an independent cohort of 49,738 additional UK
Biobank participants.

Results: In the coronary artery disease case-control cohort, increased risk for carriers of a
monogenic variant ranged from 1.3-fold for those in the lowest polygenic score quintile to 12.6fold for those in the highest. For breast cancer, increased risk ranged from 2.4 to 6.9-fold across
polygenic score quintiles. Among the 49,738 UK Biobank participants who carried a monogenic
risk variant, the probability of disease at age 75 years was strongly modified by polygenic risk.
Across individuals in the lowest to highest percentiles of polygenic risk, the probability of
disease ranged from 17% to 78% for coronary artery disease; 13% to 76% for breast cancer;
and 11% to 80% for colon cancer.

Conclusions: For three important genomic conditions, polygenic risk powerfully modifies the risk
conferred by monogenic risk variants.

Background
For a range of common heritable diseases, a small subset of the population inherits a rare
monogenic variant that causes a large increase in disease risk by disrupting a specific
physiological pathway. More recently, polygenic scores have been developed that integrate the
effects of many common genetic variants on disease risk. While the common variants have
small individual effects (in the range of a few percent) on disease risk, they can cumulatively
have large effects—producing, in some individuals, risks equivalent to the strong monogenic
variants.1–4
A key open question is how monogenic and polygenic risk interact: Can disease risk from a
monogenic variant that causes major disruption to a specific pathway be meaningfully modified
by polygenic risk factors that involve small perturbations to a wide range of cellular pathways?
Taking familial hypercholesterolemia as an example, monogenic variants predispose to
premature coronary artery disease through major dysregulation of clearance of LDL cholesterol
from the circulation. By contrast, only a small minority (~20%) of common DNA variants that
predispose to coronary artery disease operate via cholesterol-related pathways, with the
remainder affecting non-cholesterol related pathways (such as inflammation, cellular
proliferation, vascular tone) and many additional pathways yet to be discovered.5 Similarly,
pathway analyses indicate that less than 20% of common variants linked to breast or colorectal
cancer affect genes involved in DNA repair pathways, which are implicated in monogenic
hereditary breast and ovarian cancer or Lynch syndrome.3,6
We explored this question by performing genetic analysis for three diseases—familial
hypercholesterolemia, hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, and Lynch syndrome predisposing
to colorectal cancer—for which about 1% of the population inherits a monogenic variant having
a strong effect on disease risk.7,8

Although such variants are associated with several-fold increased risk of disease, it has long
been recognized that the variants have incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity. For
example, in one U.S. healthcare system, more than 50% of familial hypercholesterolemia
variant carriers and more than 70% of female hereditary breast and ovarian cancer variant
carriers remained free of disease well into middle age.9,10
Polygenic risk might help explain variation in outcomes for carriers of monogenic variants. If
so, it could have important fundamental implications both for understanding disease physiology
and for genetic counseling.
Here, we studied in 81,881 individuals to examine whether polygenic risk can account for
variation in outcomes for carriers of monogenic variants—a topic that has both scientific
implications about disease physiology and clinical implications for genetic counseling.

Methods:
Study populations
We studied three diseases: coronary artery disease, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer.
For coronary artery disease, we designed and studied a case-control cohort (6,449 cases and
6,430 controls) derived from the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort study that enrolled middleaged adult participants between 2006 and 2010.11 We followed up these results in an
independent cohort of 49,738 participants of the UK Biobank who previously underwent exome
sequencing.12 For breast cancer, we studied an all female case-control cohort (1,920 cases and
17,344 controls) from a commercial testing laboratory (Color Genomics; Burlingame, CA), and
then followed up the results in 27,144 female UK Biobank participants. For colorectal cancer, we
studied 49,738 UK Biobank participants.
For participants in the UK Biobank, cases of coronary artery disease, breast cancer, and
colorectal cancer were identified based on a combination of self-reported data confirmed by
trained healthcare professionals, hospitalization records, and national procedural, cancer, and
death registries. For participants in the commercial testing cohort, breast cancer status was
defined based on self-report at the time of enrollment.13 Additional details on study cohorts,
genetic testing, and disease ascertainment are provided in the Supplementary Appendix.

Monogenic variant classification
For each of three conditions, observed variants were classified as pathogenic or likely
pathogenic by a laboratory geneticist according to current clinical standards blinded to any
phenotype data.14 We analyzed three genes causal for familial hypercholesterolemia (LDLR,
APOB, and PCSK9), two for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome (BRCA1 and
BRCA2), and four for Lynch syndrome (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2).

Polygenic background

To quantify the contribution of polygenic background to disease, we calculated previously
validated polygenic scores for each of the three diseases.1–3 Ancestry-corrected reference
distributions for each score were generated, as described previously (Fig. S1 in the
Supplementary Appendix).15

Statistical Analysis
In the coronary artery disease and breast cancer case-control studies, logistic regression
was used to determine risk among participants stratified by monogenic variant status and
polygenic score. Within the cohort of 49,738 UK Biobank participants, we modeled the odds
ratio for disease according to monogenic variant status and polygenic score percentiles. A
second analysis estimated probability of disease by age 75 years using Cox regression,
standardized to the mean of all covariates in each population. All regression models were
adjusted for age, sex, and genetic ancestry — as quantified by the first four principal
components — except for breast cancer analyses, which were restricted to females.16

Results
Polygenic background modifies risk of coronary artery disease conferred by familial
hypercholesterolemia variants
We first studied the interaction of monogenic risk variants and polygenic scores in coronary
artery disease. To identify individuals with monogenic variants causal for familial
hypercholesterolemia, we sequenced the three genes related to the condition — LDLR, APOB,
and PCSK9 — in 6,449 coronary artery disease cases and 6,430 controls derived from the UK
Biobank (Table 1). Each of the observed genetic variants was reviewed by a laboratory
geneticist blinded to any phenotype data. A total of 28 distinct genetic variants were classified
as pathogenic or likely pathogenic; they were present in 43 (0.67%) cases and 13 (0.20%)
controls. The presence of a familial hypercholesterolemia variant conferred a 3.17-fold
increased risk of coronary artery disease (95% confidence interval [CI] 1.70 to 5.92).
We next examined the effect of participants’ polygenic background on risk of coronary artery
disease, by computing a previously validated polygenic score in all cases and controls. Even
among carriers of a familial hypercholesterolemia variant, the observed risk varied substantially
according to the polygenic score. We classified individuals as having low polygenic score
(bottom quintile), intermediate polygenic score (quintiles 2-4), or high polygenic score (top
quintile). Compared to individuals who did not carry a pathogenic mutation, the risk among
mutation carriers ranged from 1.30-fold (95% CI 0.39 to 4.31) for those in the lowest quintile of
the polygenic score distribution to 12.59 (95% CI 2.96 to 53.53) in the highest quintile (Figure
1A).
We next examined an independent cohort of 49,738 UK Biobank participants, after
confirming that monogenic variants and the polygenic score were both associated with coronary
artery disease as expected (Tables S1-2 in the Supplementary Appendix). A laboratory
geneticist identified a familial hypercholesterolemia variant in 131 (0.26%) of these participants,
which conferred a 5.02-fold (95%CI 2.97 to 8.46) increased risk of coronary artery disease at

the time of enrollment. The polygenic score for coronary artery disease was normally distributed
in the population and strongly associated with disease — odds ratio per standard deviation
increment of 1.64 (95%CI 1.57 to 1.72). Within a logistic regression model, the relationship
between the polygenic score and prevalent disease conformed to a linear model (Fig. S2 and
Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Joint modeling of monogenic variant carrier status and polygenic score indicate substantial
gradients in risk of coronary artery disease according to inherited DNA variation that can be
assessed from the time of birth. Odds ratio for coronary artery disease in monogenic variant
carriers — as compared to noncarriers with average polygenic score — ranged from 1.59 to
21.24 across percentiles of the polygenic score (Figure 1B). Modeling the probability of disease
by age 75 years indicated striking gradients in risk, ranging from 4.8% for individuals who were
both noncarriers and in the lowest percentile of the polygenic score to 77.7% for individuals with
a monogenic risk variant who were also in the highest polygenic score percentile (Figure 1C).

Polygenic background modifies risk of breast cancer conferred by familial hereditary breast and
ovarian cancer variants
We next set out to apply the same analysis to breast cancer. We first identified monogenic
risk variants by sequencing the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in 1920 breast cancer cases and
17,344 controls, all female, from the Color Genomics commercial testing laboratory (Table 2). A
pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant was identified in 176 (9.1%) cases and 674 (3.9%)
controls, corresponding to a 3.48-fold (95% CI 2.81 to 4.21) increased risk of breast cancer in
variant carriers. We then calculated polygenic risk for breast cancer, using a previously
validated polygenic score. As we saw for coronary artery disease, breast cancer risk was
strongly affected by polygenic background. Compared to noncarriers with intermediate
polygenic score, increased risk among carriers ranged from 2.40-fold (95% CI 1.58 to 3.65) for

those in the lowest quintile of the polygenic score distribution to 6.85-fold (95% CI 4.71 to 9.96)
in the highest quintile (Figure 2B).
We extended these results into the UK Biobank participants, this time focusing only on the
27,144 female participants. A laboratory geneticist reviewed all observed genetic variants in the
BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, identifying 116 carriers of pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants.
These variants conferred a 4.45-fold increased risk of breast cancer (95%CI 2.75 to 7.20). The
polygenic score was associated with an odds ratio per standard deviation increment of 1.61
(95%CI 1.52 to 1.70), with the relationship to breast cancer again conforming to a linear model
(Fig. S2 and Table S3 in the Supplementary Appendix).
Joint modeling of both monogenic variant status and polygenic score indicated that the risk
for breast cancer among carriers of a BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant ranges from 1.43 to 16.41
increased risk across percentile of the polygenic score. When modeled as probability of disease
by age 75 years, risk among monogenic variant carriers ranged from 12.8 to 75.5% and risk
among noncarriers ranged from 3.4 to 29.7%.

Risk of colorectal cancer varies according to Lynch syndrome monogenic variant carrier status
and polygenic score
We explored a third disease, colorectal cancer, in the same set of 49,738 UK Biobank
participants used above. A pathogenic or likely pathogenic Lynch syndrome variant was
identified in 76 (0.15%) individuals, conferring an odds ratio for colorectal cancer of 27.69
(95%CI 14.27 to 53.72). The odds ratio per standard deviation increment in the colorectal
cancer polygenic score was 1.66 (95%CI 1.48 to 1.85). Joint modeling of monogenic variants
and the polygenic score — using noncarriers with average polygenic score as the reference
group — noted odds ratios ranging from 8.34 to 117.53 for carriers of monogenic variants and
0.27 to 3.78 for noncarriers (Figure 3A). Absolute risk of colorectal cancer by age 75 years
ranged from 11.6 to 79.5% for carriers and 0.7 to 8.7% for noncarriers (Figure 3B).

Discussion:
Our analysis of the interaction between monogenic risk variants and polygenic background
— for three important genomic conditions: familial hypercholesterolemia, hereditary breast and
ovarian cancer syndrome, and Lynch syndrome — has two important implications.
First, we were surprised that risk conferred by monogenic risk variants, which act by
perturbing a specific molecular pathway, can be so substantially modified by polygenic
background, which appears to act by affecting a diverse set of physiological processes. From a
physiological standpoint, it is not clear why the major disruptions caused by monogenic variants
can be offset by other factors. Yet, the risk for monogenic variant carriers with the lowest
polygenic risk scores approached the population average. Understanding the physiological
basis for these interactions may suggest therapeutic strategies for monogenic variant carriers in
general.
Second, our findings indicate that accounting for polygenic background is likely to increase
the accuracy of risk estimation for individuals who inherit a monogenic risk variant. An important
example is the decision about whether to undergo prophylactic mastectomy (as opposed to
serial imaging) faced by carriers of a BRCA1 variant.17 At present, up to 50% of women opt for
prophylactic mastectomy, but rates are highly variable.18,19 Here, we find a broad spectrum of
risk across percentiles of the polygenic score that may better inform shared decision making —
odds ratios compared to noncarriers ranging from 1.4 to 16.4 and an absolute risk at age 75
years ranging from 13 to 76%. Similarly, refined risk estimates may improve decisions about the
timing and intensity of lipid-lowering therapy for individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia
and whether to undergo serial colonoscopies or prophylactic colectomy for individuals with
Lynch syndrome variants.
In a clinical setting, assessing both monogenic risk variants and polygenic risk requires highcoverage sequencing of genes associated with monogenic risk and an approach to assay
common variants across the genome. At present, this can be accomplished by various

approaches, including (i) high-coverage whole genome sequencing,15 (ii) whole exome
sequencing and genotyping array, or (iii) targeted high-coverage sequencing of individuals
genes and with low-coverage sequencing across the genome.20 Ongoing efforts to improve the
cost and accessibility of these technologies will improve the feasibility of incorporating this
information into routine clinical practice.
From a statistical standpoint, our data indicate that polygenic risk contributes to the
incomplete penetrance of the monogenic risk variants. Additionally, our data suggest a roughly
additive interaction between monogenic risk variants and polygenic risk, although the statistical
power to detect non-additive interaction was limited by the number of individuals carrying
monogenic risk variants. Within the cohort of 49,738 UK Biobank participants, the p-values for
interaction were 0.07, 0.53, and 0.49 for coronary artery disease, breast cancer, and colorectal
cancer, respectively.
Our results should be interpreted in the context of potential limitations. First, UK Biobank
participants tend to be healthier than the general population. Disease risk models should be
calibrated for a given target population prior to clinical use.21 Second, our analysis focused only
on the role of the monogenic variants for the three conditions studied; for example, it did not
consider the risk of the breast and ovarian cancer variants on ovarian cancer.22 Third, we
aggregated together all pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants for each monogenic condition;
however; there may be heterogeneity among these variants.22–24 Fourth, further efforts are
needed to understand how best to disclose integrated genomic risk assessments to patients
and treating clinicians and how to integrate them with existing predictors based on nongenetic
factors.25–27
Finally, we highlight an important equity issue. The fact that our knowledge concerning the
monogenic risk variants and the development of the polygenic scores has been based primarily
on patients of European ancestry affects the utility for patients of other ancestries.15,28–30 In
particular, the polygenic scores are known to be less precise for other ancestry groups.30 It is

Figure 1: Polygenic background and risk of coronary artery disease in familial
hypercholesterolemia
In panel A, case-control participants for coronary artery disease in the UK Biobank (n=12,879)
were stratified into three groups according to their polygenic score — low, intermediate, or high
defined as the lowest quintile, the middle three quintiles, and the highest quintile of the
polygenic score distribution respectively. For carriers and noncarriers of familial
hypercholesterolemia in each polygenic score group, the odds ratio for coronary artery disease
was calculated in a logistic regression model with age, sex, and the first four principal
components of ancestry as covariates. Non-carriers with intermediate polygenic score served as
the reference group. In panels B and C, for UK Biobank participants (n=49,738), shown are the
predicted odds ratios of coronary artery disease (panel B) and predicted probability of coronary
artery disease by age 75 years (panel C) in each percentile (dots) of the polygenic score
distribution for carriers (blue) and noncarriers (brown) of familial hypercholesterolemia variants.
For calculating the odds ratios, a logistic regression model with age, sex, and the first four
principal components of ancestry was used, and the predicted odds ratios were calculated by
referencing to the risk of average polygenic risk score and conditioning on the mean value of
each covariate. The predicted probability of disease as a function of monogenic variant carrier
status and polygenic score was modeled using Cox regression models with age, sex, and the
first four principal components of ancestry as covariates. Prevalent cases at baseline enrollment
in the UK Biobank and incident cases during follow-up were included (Table S2 in the
Supplementary Appendix). The shaded area around the dots represents the 95% confidence
interval. The horizontal dashed lines show the odds ratio or probability of disease for people
with average polygenic risk score. FH — familial hypercholesterolemia

Figure 2: Polygenic background and risk of breast cancer in hereditary breast and ovarian
cancer
In panel A, case-control participants for breast cancer in Color Genomics (n=19,264) were
stratified into three groups according to their polygenic score — low, intermediate, or high
defined as the lowest quintile, the middle three quintiles, and the highest quintile of the
polygenic score distribution respectively. For carriers and noncarriers of hereditary breast and
ovarian cancer variants in each polygenic score group, the odds ratio for breast cancer was
calculated in a logistic regression model with age and the first four principal components of
ancestry as covariates. Non-carriers with intermediate polygenic score served as the reference
group. In panels B and C, for female UK Biobank participants (n=27,144), shown are the
predicted odds ratios of breast cancer (panel B) and predicted probability of breast cancer by
age 75 years (panel C) in each percentile (dots) of the polygenic score distribution for carriers
(blue) and noncarriers (brown) of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer variants. For calculating
the odds ratios, a logistic regression model with age and the first four principal components of
ancestry was used, and the predicted odds ratios were calculated by referencing to the risk of
average polygenic risk score and conditioning on the mean value of each covariate. The
predicted probability of disease as a function of monogenic variant carrier status and polygenic
score was modeled using Cox regression models with age and the first four principal
components of ancestry as covariates. Prevalent cases at baseline enrollment in the UK
Biobank and incident cases during follow-up were included (Table S2 in the Supplementary
Appendix). The shaded area around the dots represents the 95% confidence interval. The
horizontal dashed lines show the odds ratio or probability of disease for people with average
polygenic risk score. HBOC — hereditary breast and ovarian cancer

Figure 3: Polygenic background and risk of colorectal cancer in Lynch syndrome
For UK Biobank participants (n=49,738), shown are the predicted odds ratios of colorectal
cancer (panel A) and predicted probability of colorectal cancer by age 75 years (panel B) in
each percentile (dots) of the polygenic score distribution for carriers (blue) and noncarriers
(brown) of Lynch syndrome variants. For calculating the odds ratios, a logistic regression model
with age, sex, and the first four principal components of ancestry was used, and the predicted
odds ratios were calculated by referencing to the risk of average polygenic risk score and
