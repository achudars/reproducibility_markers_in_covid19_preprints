Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoproliferative malignancy of B-cell origin that accounts for 10%
of all lymphomas. Despite evidence suggesting strong familial clustering of HL, there is no clear
understanding of the contribution of genes predisposing to HL. In this study, whole genome
sequencing (WGS) was performed on 7 affected and 9 unaffected family members from three HLprone families and variants were prioritized using our Familial Cancer Variant Prioritization Pipeline
(FCVPPv2). WGS identified a total of 98564, 170550 and 113654 variants which were reduced by
pedigree-based filtering to 18158, 465 and 26465 in families I, II and III, respectively. In addition to
variants affecting amino acid sequences, variants in promoters, enhancers, transcription factors
binding sites and microRNA seed sequences were identified from upstream, downstream, 5’ and 3’
untranslated regions. A panel of 565 cancer predisposing and other cancer-related genes and of 2383

high-risk HL genes were also screened in these families to aid further prioritization. Pathway analysis
of segregating genes with CADD (Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion Tool) scores > 20 was
performed using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software which implicated several candidate genes in
pathways involved in B-cell activation and proliferation and in the network of “Cancer,
Hematological disease and Immunological Disease”. We used the FCVPPv2 for further in silico
analysis and prioritized 45 coding and 79 non-coding variants from the three families. Further
literature-based analysis allowed us to constrict this list to one rare germline variant each in families I
and II and two in family III. Functional studies were conducted on the candidate from family I in a
previous study, resulting in the identification and functional validation of a novel heterozygous
missense variant in the tumor suppressor gene DICER1 as potential HL predisposition factor. We aim
to identify the individual genes responsible for predisposition in the remaining two families and will
functionally validate these in further studies.

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a lymphoproliferative malignancy originated in germinal center B-cells
and is reported to account for about 10% of newly diagnosed lymphomas and 1% of all de novo
neoplasms worldwide with an incidence of about 3 cases per 100,000 people in Western countries
(Diehl et al., 2004). It is the one of the most common tumors in young adults in economically
developed countries, with one peak of incidence in the third decade of life and a second peak after 50
years of age.

53
54
55
56

Based on differences in the morphology and phenotype of the lymphoma cells and the composition
of the cellular infiltrate, HL is subdivided into classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) that accounts for
about 95% of cases and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) that
accounts for the remaining 5% of cases (Kuppers, 2009).

Although familial risk for HL is reported to be among the highest of all cancers (Kharazmi et al.,
2015), not many genetic risk factors have been identified. An association between various HLA class
I and class II alleles and increased risk of HL has been reported (Diepstra et al., 2005), while other
non-HLA susceptibility loci have been detected through genome-wide association studies (Frampton
et al., 2013;Cozen et al., 2014;Kushekhar et al., 2014).The identification of major predisposing genes
is a more daunting task; however, rare germline variants in KLDHC8B, NPAT, ACAN, KDR, DICER1
and POT1 gene have been reported by different groups in high-risk HL families (Salipante et al.,
2009;Saarinen et al., 2011;Ristolainen et al., 2015;Rotunno et al., 2016;Bandapalli et al.,
2018;McMaster et al., 2018).

Here we report the results of whole genome sequencing (WGS) performed in three families with
documented recurrence of HL. We used our Familial Cancer Variant Prioritization Pipeline
(FCVPPv2) (Kumar et al., 2018) as well as two gene/variant panels based on cancer predisposing
genes and variants prioritized in the largest familial HL cohort study to date in order to identify
possible disease-causing high-penetrance germline variants in each family (Zhang et al.,
2015;Rotunno et al., 2016). Pathway and network analyses using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis
software also allowed us to gain insight into the molecular mechanisms of the pathogenesis of HL.
We hope that these results can be used in the development of targeted therapy and in the screening of
other individuals at risk of developing HL.

Three families with documented recurrence of HL were analyzed in this study, with a total number of
16 individuals (7 affected and 9 unaffected). HL family I and family III were recruited at the
University Hospital of Heidelberg, Germany, while family II was recruited at the Pomeranian
Medical University, Szczecin, Poland.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) of available affected and unaffected members of the three HL
families was performed using Illumina-based small read sequencing. Mapping to reference human
genome (assembly version Hs37d5) was performed using BWA mem (version 0.7.8) (Li and Durbin,
2009) and duplicates were removed using biobambam (version 0.0.148). The SAMtools suite (Li,
2011) was used to detect single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and Platypus (Rimmer et al., 2014) to
detect indels. Variants were annotated using ANNOVAR, 1000 Genomes, dbSNP and ExAC
(Smigielski et al., 2000;Wang et al., 2010;The Genomes Project et al., 2015;Lek et al., 2016).
Variants with a quality score greater than 20 and a coverage greater than 5x, SNVs that passed the
strand bias filter (a minimum one read support from both forward and reverse strand) and indels that
passed all the Platypus internal filters were evaluated further for minor allele frequencies (MAFs)
with respect to the 1000 Genomes Phase 3 and non-TCGA ExAC data. Variants with a MAF less
than 0.1 % were deduced from these two datasets. A pairwise comparison of shared rare variants was
performed to check for sample swaps and family relatedness.

2.3.1 Prioritization of coding variants

103
104
105
106

Variant evaluation was performed using the criteria of our in-house developed variant prioritization
pipeline (FCVPPv2) (Kumar et al., 2018). First, variants with MAF < 0.1% were filtered based on
the pedigree data considering cancer patients as cases and unaffected persons as controls. The
probability of an individual being a Mendelian case or true control was considered.

107
108
109
110
111

114

Variants were then ranked using the combined annotation dependent depletion (CADD) tool v1.3
(Kircher et al., 2014). Only variants with a scaled PHRED-like Combined Annotation Dependent
Depletion (CADD) score greater than 10, i.e. variants belonging to the top 1 % of probable
deleterious variants in the human genome, were considered further. Genomic Evolutionary Rate
Profiling (GERP) (Cooper et al., 2005), PhastCons (Siepel et al., 2005) and PhyloP (Pollard et al.,
2010) were used to evaluate the evolutionary conservation of a particular variant. GERP scores >
2.0, PhastCons scores > 0.3 and PhyloP scores ≥ 3.0 were indicative of a good level of conservation
and were therefore used as thresholds in the selection of potentially causative variants.

115
116
117

Next, all missense variants were assessed for deleteriousness using 10 tools accessed using dbNSFP
(Liu et al., 2016), namely SIFT, PolyPhen V2-HDV, PolyPhen V2-HVAR, LRT, MutationTaster,
Mutation Assessor, FATHMM, MetaSVM, MetLR and PROVEAN. Variants predicted to be

variants were attained via VarSome (Kopanos et al., 2018), the final verdict on pathogenicity offered
by VarSome was based on the following tools: DANN, MutationTaster, FATHMM-MKL,
FATHMM-XF, ALoFT, EIGEN, EIGEN PC and PrimateAI.

Lastly, three different intolerance scores derived from NHLBI-ESP6500 (Petrovski et al., 2013),
ExAC (Lek et al., 2016) and a local dataset, all of which were developed with allele frequency data,
were included to evaluate the intolerance of genes to functional mutations. However, these scores
were used merely to rank the variants and not as cut-offs for selection. The ExAC consortium has
developed two additional scoring systems using large-scale exome sequencing data including
intolerance scores (pLI) for loss-of-function variants and Z-scores for missense and synonymous
variants. These were used for nonsense and missense variants, respectively.

Variants located in the 3’ and 5’ untranslated regions (UTRs) were prioritized based on their location
in regulatory regions. Putative miRNA targets at variant positions within 3’ UTRs and 1 kb
downstream of transcription end sites were detected by scanning the entire dataset of the human
miRNA target atlas from TargetScan 7.0 (Agarwal et al., 2015) using the intersect function of
bedtools. Similarly, 5’UTRs and regions 1 kb upstream of transcription start sites were scanned for
putative enhancers and promoters using merged enhancer and promoter data from the FANTOM5
consortium as well as super-enhancer data from the super-enhancer archive (SEA) and dbSUPER.
These regions were also scanned for transcription factor binding sites using SNPnexus (Dayem Ullah
et al., 2018).

The regulatory nature and the possible functional effects of non-coding variants were evaluated using
CADD v1.3, HaploReg V4 (Ward and Kellis, 2012) and RegulomeDB (Boyle et al., 2012), primarily
based on ENCODE data (Birney et al., 2007). Epigenomic data and marks from 127 cell lines from
the NIH Roadmap Epigenomics Mapping Consortium were accessed via CADD v1.3, which gave us
information on chromatin states from ChromHmm and Segway. CADD also provided mirSVR scores
to rank predicted microRNA target sites by a down-regulation score. These scores are based on a new
machine learning method based on sequence and contextual features extracted from miRandapredicted target sites (Betel et al., 2010). Furthermore, SNPnexus was used to access non-coding
scores for each variant and to identify regulatory variants located in CpG islands.

149
150
151
152

The final selection of 3’UTR and downstream variants was based on their CADD scores > 10 and
whether or not they had predicted miRNA target site matches. Similarly, upstream and 5’ UTR
variants in enhancers, promoters, super-enhancers or transcription factor binding sites with CADD
scores > 10 were short-listed.

In a study on cancer predisposing genes (CPGs) in pediatric cancers, Zhang et al. compiled 565
CPGs based on review of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) and
medical literature (Zhang et al., 2015). The categories included genes associated with autosomal
dominant cancer-predisposition syndromes (60), genes associated with autosomal recessive cancerpredisposition syndromes (29), tumor-suppressor genes (58), tyrosine kinase genes (23) and other
cancer genes (395). We investigated a list of genes corresponding to our shortlisted coding and noncoding variants for their presence in the list of genes in the aforementioned study.

In a study by Rotunno et al., 2699 variants corresponding to 2383 genes were identified in 17 HL
discovery families after filtering and prioritization (Rotunno et al., 2016). We intersected our list of
candidate genes with this list of 2383 HL genes to identify coding and non-coding variants from our
shortlist in potentially causative HL genes.

Specific variants of interest mentioned throughout the text were validated using specific primers for
polymerase chain reaction amplification designed with Primer3 (http://bioinfo.ut.ee/primer3-0.4.0/)
and Sanger sequencing on a 3500 Dx Genetic Analyzer (Life Technologies, CA, USA), using ABI
PRISM 3.1 Big Dye terminator chemistry, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The
electrophoretic profiles were analyzed manually. Segregation analysis of the prioritized variants was
performed in additional family members when DNA was available. Primer details are available on

IPA (Qiagen; http://www.qiagen.com/ingenuity; analysis date 15/10/2019) was used to perform a
core analysis to identify enriched canonical pathways, diseases, biological functions and molecular
networks among genes that passed the allele frequency cut-off, fulfilled family-based segregation
criteria, met the CADD score cut-off and were not intergenic or intronic variants. Data were analyzed
for all three families together. Top canonical pathways were identified from the IPA pathway library
and ranked according to their significance to our input data. This significance was determined by pvalues calculated using the right tailed Fisher’s exact test.

IPA was also used to generate gene networks in which upstream regulators were connected to the
input dataset genes while taking advantage of paths that involved more than one link (i.e., through
intermediate regulators). These connections represent experimentally observed cause-effect
relationships that relate to expression, transcription, activation, molecular modification and transport
as well as binding events. The networks were ranked according to scores that were generated by
considering the number of focus genes (input data) and the size of the network to approximate the
relevance of the network to the original list of focus genes.

In family I (Figure 1A), the proband (III-1) and her mother (II-2) were diagnosed with two different
histological subtypes of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) at the ages of 7 and 34, respectively.
The daughter was diagnosed with nodular sclerosis cHL and the mother with lymphocyte-rich cHL.
The sample of the unaffected father (II-1) was also sequenced. Family II (Figure 1B) is characterized
by a strong recurrence of HL. Five family members were diagnosed with HL (II-3, II-4, III-3, III-4
and III-5), of which three (III-3, III-4 and III-5) underwent WGS. In addition, the family member (II6), who was considered as an obligatory carrier of the mutation, was sequenced as were samples and
four healthy family members (III-1, III-2, III-6 and III-8) and one family member diagnosed with
uterine cancer (II-1) as controls. In family 3 (Figure 1C), II-1 and II-2 were diagnosed with cHL, at
the age of 27 and 24 respectively. Their parents (I-1, I-2) were not affected, however one of them is
expected to be a carrier and analyzed accordingly.

208

WGS of 7 affected and 9 unaffected members from the three studied families identified a total
number of 98564, 170550 and 113654 variants which were reduced by pedigree-based filtering to
18158, 465 and 26465 in families I, II and III, respectively.

variants with CADD scores > 10 were taken into further consideration and prioritized according to
deleteriousness, intolerance and conservational scores, as detailed in the methods section. At the end
of this process, 37 potential missense variants and 9 potential nonsense mutations were prioritized for
families I - III and are shown in Tables 1 and 2.

Pedigree-based filtering also reduced the number of potentially interesting variants located in the
untranslated regions to 523 for 5’UTR variants (130 in family I, 5 in family II and 314 in family III)
and 854 for 3’UTR variants (347 in family I, 10 in family II and 497 in family III). These variants
were further prioritized based on their CADD score > 10 and their localization in known regulatory
regions (Supplementary Table 1). 5’UTR variants were analyzed by the SNPNexus tool, which
allowed us to identify 4 variants located in transcription factors binding sites. In addition, the
intersect function of bedtools was used to identify further 15 variants located in promoter regions and
4 located in super-enhancer regions. Among variants located in the 3’UTR region, 56 variants located
in miRNA seed sequences were selected.

Intersecting our prioritized list of candidate genes with the list of 565 CPGs identified 11 genes with
variants in coding and selected non-coding regions (upstream and downstream variants, 3’ and 5’
UTRs) of the known CPGs. These include FUBP1, SEPT6, DICER1, EZR and NCOA1 from family 1
and BCL6, RAD51D, LPP and PTCH1 from family 3 (Table 3). DICER1 and PTCH1 are known in
autosomal dominant cancer-predisposition syndromes, whereas the rest are categorized as being
“other cancer genes”.

234
235
236
237

In addition to the identification of 11 variants in CPGs, we intersected our prioritized list of genes
with a list of 2383 genes with potentially causative variants from a large WES-based familial HL
study. We found 25 variants in the coding and non-coding regions in 23 of the HL genes, with 7
coming from family I and 18 from family III (Table 4).

Pathway analysis of the selected variants performed with IPA showed an enrichment of mutations in
genes involved in pathways essential for B-cell proliferation and activation, specifically B-cell
receptor signaling, and PI3K signaling in B lymphocytes and B cell activating factor signaling
(Supplementary Table 2A, Supplementary Figures 1A and 1B).

Similarly, the IPA network analysis generated a comprehensive picture of possible gene interactions
between our candidate genes (Supplementary Table 2B). The top network is related to cancer,
hematological disease and immunological disease, which is in complete coherence with the
pathogenesis of HL. Many genes from the prioritized list of top candidates are shown to play a role in
the top networks (Figure 2).

With the aim of identifying high penetrance dominant variant per family, we used our pipeline results
and literature-based mining to determine the genes’ link to Hodgkin lymphoma or immune-related
processes. For family 1, we have short-listed 5 potential candidates (DICER1, HLTF, NOTCH3,
PLK3 and RELB). Based on segregation, confirmation and functional validation, we identified
DICER1 as a candidate HL predisposing gene by showing significant down-regulation of tumor
suppressor miRNAs in DICER1-mutated family members (Bandapalli et al., 2018). The presence of
DICER1 in the list of 565 CPGs also reinforces its status as the disease-causing variant in this family.

262
263
264

In family 2, three exonic variants made it to the final list (ALAD, CERCAM and SPTAN1) of which
SPTAN1 was shown to be among the genes in one of the top IPA networks (Network 3; Figure 2C).
No coding or non-coding variants intersected with the panel of CPGs or HL candidate genes.

Two genes stand out in family 3, namely LPP and RAD51D. Both genes were found in the list of 565
CPGs and LPP was additionally found in the gene list from the large cohort of HL families. Three
variants in LPP were prioritized by the FCVPPv2 and made it to the shortlist including one stopgain
variant (3_188123978_G_T), one 3’UTR (3_188608373_A_T) and one nonsynonymous missense
variant (3_188123979_A_T). LPP (LIM domain containing preferred translocation partner in lipoma)
is a member of the zyxin family of LIM proteins that is characterized as a promoter of
mesenchymal/fibroblast cell migration. LPP has been shown to be a critical inducer of tumor cell
migration, invasion and metastasis by virtue of its ability to localize to adhesions and to promote
invadopodia formation (Ngan et al., 2018). A genome-wide association study of 253 Chinese
individuals with B-cell NHL also identified a new susceptibility locus between BCL6 and LPP that
was significantly associated with the increased risk of B-cell NHL (Tan et al., 2013). On the other
hand, there are no reports of an association between RAD51D and lymphomas; however, it is a wellestablished susceptibility gene in Breast-Ovarian Cancer, Familial 4 and Hereditary Breast Ovarian
Cancer Syndrome (Loveday et al., 2011;Chen et al., 2018). The final selection of a candidate in this
family will be based on further functional studies.

In summary, WGS data analysis of three families with reported recurrence of HL allowed us to
prioritize 45 coding and 79 non-coding variants from which we subsequently selected and validated
one for family I, (DICER1), short-listed three and two for families II (ALAD, CERCAM and SPTAN1)
and III (RAD51and LPP) respectively to investigate further with validation and functional studies.
For family I we have already functionally validated DICER1 as the candidate predisposing gene in a
previous study (Bandapalli et al., 2018). However, the family was included in this paper, especially
with regard to the pathway and network analyses. We identified pathways related to B-cell
proliferation and networks related to cancer, hematological disease, immunological disease,
hereditary disorders, cell death and cell survival using IPA software, helping us to prioritize genes
with functions in the pathogenesis of HL.

Personalized medicine is an upcoming and promising field of medicine in which medical decisions,
practices, interventions and products are tailored to the individual patient based on their predicted
response or risk of disease. The scope of this field has advanced rapidly with the advent of genomics
and other omics and the possibility of implicating one gene or a set of genes in the pathogenesis of a
particular disease. Thus, the identification of germline predisposing genes could be of great value in
the screening of individuals at risk of developing HL, as well as in the development of personalized
adjuvant therapies based on the affected pathways. In this aspect, delta‐aminolevulinate dehydratase
(ALAD) from family 2 is interesting as it is involved in the catalysis of second step in the
biosynthesis of heme and is also acts as an endogenous inhibitor of the 26S proteasome, a multicatalytic ATP-dependent protease complex that functions as the degrading arm of the ubiquitin
system:the major pathway for regulated degradation of proteins in all eukaryotes. Down regulation of
ALAD is shown to be associated with poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer (Ge et al., 2017)
whereas the existing data on nonerythroid spectrin αII (SPTAN1) suggest that overexpression of
SPTAN1 in tumor cells reflects neoplastic and tumor promoting activity or tumor suppressing effects
by enabling DNA repair through interaction with DNA repair proteins (Ackermann and Brieger,
2019) and CERCAM is known as an unfavourable prognostic marker in urothelial, rencal and ovarian
cancers implying the importance of the variants in these genes (Ma et al., 2016). RAD51D from
family III is particularly interesting since RAD51D is involved in DNA repair through homologous
recombination. Therefore, it is possible that carcinomas arising in patients carrying mutations in this
gene will be sensitive to chemotherapeutic agents that target this pathway, such as cisplatin and the

PARP (poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase) inhibitor olaparib. This has already been demonstrated in
BRCA1/2 mutation-carrier cancer patients (Banerjee et al., 2010;Loveday et al., 2011). This approach
can also be applied to target pathways affected by the mutated genes. Several candidate genes were
identified by IPA pathway analysis in B cell receptor pathways, offering a valuable target for other
pharmaceutical drugs. The B cell receptor (BCR) signaling pathway, when dysregulated, is a potent
contributor to lympomagenesis and tumor survival (Valla et al., 2018). This pathway has been
targeted in B-cell lymphomas and leukemias with several BCR-directed agents, such as inhibitors of
Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK9), spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase
(PI3K) (Buggy and Elias, 2012;Dreyling et al., 2017;Liu and Mamorska-Dyga, 2017). In one study,
excellent response rates could be demonstrated in certain non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes,
however, issues related to the development of resistance to BTK inhibitors need to be addressed
(Valla et al., 2018).

Advancements in the field of genomics have allowed WGS to become the state-of-the-art tool for the
identification of novel cancer predisposing genes in Mendelian diseases. It is still a challenge to
appropriately interpret the immense amount of data generated by WGS, especially with respect to
non-coding variants. In our study, we have attempted to interpret a selection of non-coding variants
using in-silico and bioinformatic tools, however, the adequate analysis of intronic and intergenic
variants remains a challenge. There are several reports of WGS being successfully implemented to
implicate rare, high-penetrance germline variants in cancer, for example POT1 mutations in familial
melanoma and Hodgkin lymphoma (McMaster et al., 2018;Wong et al., 2019) and POLE and
POLD1 mutations in colorectal adenomas or carcinomas (Palles et al., 2013). In a previous study, we
have used our pipeline (FCVPPv2) to prioritize novel variants in non-medullary thyroid cancer prone
families (Srivastava et al., 2019). We have also successfully combined our pipeline with literature
review and functional studies to identify DICER1 as a candidate predisposing gene in one Hodgkin
lymphoma family (Bandapalli et al., 2018). We aim to apply these methods in the remaining Hodgkin
lymphoma families and hope that these results will facilitate personalized therapy in the studied
families and contribute to the screening of other individuals at risk of developing HL.
