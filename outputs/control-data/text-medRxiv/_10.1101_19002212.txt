Abstract:
Almost 1.2 billion long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) have been procured for malaria control. Institutional
buyers often assume that World Health Organization (WHO) prequalified LLINs are functionally identical with a
three-year lifespan. We measured the lifespans of three LLIN products, and calculated their cost-per-year of
functional life, through a randomised double-blinded prospective evaluation among 3,420 study households in
Tanzania using WHO-recommended methods. Primary outcome was LLIN functional survival (LLINs present in
serviceable condition). Secondary outcomes were 1) bioefficacy and chemical content (residual insecticidal
activity) and 2) protective efficacy for volunteers sleeping under LLINs (bite reduction and mosquitoes killed).
LLIN median functional survival was significantly different: 2·0 years for Olyset, 2·5 years for PermaNet and 2·6
years for NetProtect. Functional survival was affected by accumulation of holes resulting in users discarding nets.
Protective efficacy also significantly differed between products as they aged. The longer-lived nets were 20%
cheaper than the shorter-lived product.

Introduction:
Sleeping under LLINs remains the most cost-effective way to control malaria and reduce mortality,1
notwithstanding insecticide resistance.2 However, despite 254 million LLINs being procured globally in 2017
alone,3 global LLIN coverage remains inadequate, with only 56% of the population in endemic areas estimated to
have access to a LLIN.3 LLINs are mostly distributed through periodic mass distribution campaigns, and as a
result, population access to LLIN fluctuates over time. Access is typically high directly after a mass campaign
and then drops as low as 50% just before the next campaign, as nets wear out. This insufficiency is particularly
salient because gains in malaria control have stalled, with fewer than 50% of endemic countries remaining on
track to reach critical malaria reduction targets.3 Investment in malaria control has stagnated and was US$1·3
billion (30%) below the resources required in 2017 to meet World Health Organization (WHO) targets of reducing
malaria case incidence and mortality rates by at least 40% by 2020.3 These gaps in funding and coverage
emphasise the need to deploy products that present the best value for money.
A report to the Malaria Policy Advisory Group (MPAC) advised that increasing the functional life of long lasting
insecticidal nets (LLINs) by one or two years, would reduce the cost of malaria control by between US$500-700
million over five years.4 Currently, the WHO prequalifies LLIN products that demonstrate adequate insecticidal
activity three years after deployment, but do not appraise the physical deterioration of nets over time as part of
LLIN prequalification assessment. This has resulted in a tendering process where LLINs are assumed by donors
to be identical, and procurement is weighted by the unit price of the commodity and not product lifespan.5
However, all the available data suggests that the assumption of uniform three-year lifespan for all LLIN products
is unrealistic.6 There is a clear need for a more integrative economic approach to base purchasing decisions on
value-for-money and cost-per-effective unit of LLIN coverage.4,5 New product classes of LLINs with novel active
ingredients for insecticide resistance management are becoming available,7 but they remain susceptible to the
same forces of physical disintegration, being discarded and losing insecticidal activity. Moreover, in most cases
they cost more. This emphasises the need to consider price of LLINs in terms of cost per year of functional life.8
A functional LLIN is one that is present, in good physical condition and remains insecticidal, thereby providing
protection against vector-borne diseases through preventing bites and killing disease vectors.4 Durability, or
functional survival, of LLINs varies between geographical regions9 and environments10,11 and remains an undervalued, yet essential determinant of the success and efficiency of malaria control programmes.12,13 How long
LLINs remain protective under user conditions will dictate how frequently they must be replaced, which has both
public health and economic implications.8 In 2011, it was calculated that in Tanzania, for mean LLIN lifespan of
two, three and four years, 89, 63 and 51 million LLINs, respectively, would be needed over ten years to achieve
national access targets.12
Here we report results from a large prospective durability study of three LLIN products, conducted in Tanzania.
The proportion of LLINs remaining in use and still protective against malaria mosquitoes was measured over
three years follow-up after deployment. We calculated relative LLIN cost-effectiveness in terms of the equivalent
annual cost (EAC), which is a conventional financial indicator used to compare products with different effective
life-times. The median functional survival of each product and its EAC was calculated to inform optimal
procurement of cost-effective LLINs.12

Results:
A total of 3,393 households were randomised to which 10,571 nets were distributed (3,520 Olyset (33%), 3,513
PermaNet 2.0 (33%) and 3,538 NetProtect (33%)). The three study arms were similar in number of participants,
number of nets allocated, household characteristics, house design and socioeconomic characteristics (Table S1).
Households lost to follow up was 20% over the three years of the trial.
Functional Survival
There were significant differences between functional survival of the three products (defined as presence of
serviceable nets) (Table 1). Estimated median functional survival was 2·0 years for Olyset, 2·5 years for PermaNet
and 2·6 years for NetProtect. There was no significant difference in net use by net product (Table S2).
Economic Analysis
Simulation results show that the expected Equivalent Annual Cost (EAC) in $ USD of the three LLINs in the
study varied between $1·2 (1.1-1.4) for PermaNet and NetProtect and $1·5 (1.3-1.7) for Olyset, assuming that
each net was priced identically at $3·0 (Table 1). The longer-lived nets were approximately 20% lower in EAC
as compared to the shorter-lived Olyset product.

Components of functional survival
Attrition
There were significant differences in attrition between net products. Olyset nets were lost at a faster rate than
PermaNet 2.0 and NetProtect (Table 2, Table S3). After three years, 55% of Olyset nets were no longer present
in households compared to 42% of PermaNet 2.0 and 46% of NetProtect (p<0·001; Table 2). Of the 10,571 nets
distributed, 4,964 (46%) were lost to follow up over the whole study period (Table S4).

Physical integrity
The condition of nets that remained in households deteriorated over the course of the study. At each time point,
Olyset had the largest proportion and NetProtect had the smallest proportion of ‘too torn’ nets (Figure 1). The
median hole surface area in Olyset increased from 38 cm2 at 10 months to 459 cm2 after 36 months, compared to
6 cm2 to 295 cm2 for PermaNet 2.0 and 8 cm2 and 152 cm2 for NetProtect (Table S5). Questionnaire data showed
that in year 3, 70% of nets no longer in use had been discarded when they were perceived as too damaged to be
useful. Others were given away (17%), stolen (3%) or repurposed (3%).
Bioefficacy
At baseline, all products met optimal WHO bioefficacy criteria. After field use, there were significant differences
between the bioefficacy of the net products measured using standard WHO cone and tunnel tests over time (Table
3). At 10 months, 100% of NetProtect and PermaNet 2.0 nets met WHO optimal bioefficacy criteria, compared
to 73% of Olyset nets (p<0·001). Nets decreased in bioefficacy through time but even after three years, 96% of
NetProtect, 85% of PermaNet 2.0 and 75% of Olyset met WHO criteria for bioefficacy (p=0·017; Table 3).
When whole nets were tested using IACT, 88% of Olyset, 96% of PermaNet 2.0 and 92% of NetProtect passed
WHO optimal criteria of 80% mortality and 90% blood feeding inhibition after 3 years. There were differences
between products in 24-hour mortality. Olyset showed lower mortality (p<0·001), but all three products showed
similar levels of feeding inhibition (Figure 2, Table S6). Mosquito mortality was higher for nets defined as “too
torn” (OR = 0·65 (0·49, 0·88), p=0·005), but the differences between the net products remained significant after
adjusting for physical condition. Similarly, protection from mosquito bites (feeding inhibition) was considerably
lower in nets that were “too torn” (OR = 0·12 (0·08, 0·18), p<0·001), but the differences between the net products
remained non-significant after adjusting for physical condition.

Nets are tested by cone test and those that fail WHO optimal insecticide effectiveness criteria of 95% knockdown after 60 minutes or 80%

Active ingredient content
At baseline, 100% (10) of Olyset and PermaNet 2.0 and 50% (5) of NetProtect samples complied with their target
doses of active ingredient (Table S7). Deltamethrin content lower than the target dose in NetProtect was explained
by a high R-alpha isomer content (0·35 g/kg on average, 26% of the deltamethrin content), a non-relevant impurity
of deltamethrin, which may be formed during the manufacturing process.
After each timepoint, mean permethrin content in Olyset decreased to 16·2 g/kg, 14·8 g/kg and 13·0 g/kg,
corresponding to a loss of 20%, 27% and 36% of the original dose, respectively. Mean deltamethrin content of
PermaNet 2.0 decreased to 0·75 g/kg, 0·47 g/kg and 0·40 g/kg, corresponding to a loss of 48%, 68% and 72% of
the original dose, respectively. Mean deltamethrin content of NetProtect decreased to 0·91 g/kg, 0·52 g/kg and
0·40 g/kg, corresponding to a loss of 33%, 61% and 70% of the original dose, respectively (Table S7).

Discussion:
This large and well-powered study clearly disproves the assumption that all pyrethroid treated LLIN products
have similar lifespans. Our data also confirms that the median functional life of the LLINs in our study was closer
to two years than three years in Tanzania and for the products tested, as previously reported by a systematic review
of LLIN retention data in 39 sub-Saharan African countries.6
The WHO’s Guidelines for procuring public health pesticides14 recommends that the procurement should
consider “operational cost” rather than unit price, and an appropriate measure to compare value for money of
LLINs would be “cost per median year of net life under local conditions”. We measured the relative durability of
nets using functional survival estimates, in terms of the equivalent annual cost (EAC). The cost analysis showed
approximately 20% lower EAC when a longer-lasting LLIN (PermaNet 2.0 or NetProtect) was chosen over
Olyset, assuming prices for the products were identical. The relative increase in price that is acceptable is also
much smaller when the lifetime of the standard reference product increases. Thus, the extension of the life of a
product is much more valuable if the comparator product is relatively short-lived, as was seen in this study.
LLIN functional life also has important implications for the selection of new products for resistance management
that have a higher unit cost. New pyrethroid plus piperonyl butoxide (PBO) nets may not be as durable as standard
pyrethroid nets because PBO is lost rapidly from nets during washing, which reduces their efficacy.15 However,
in Tanzania, PBO nets continued to have superior public health benefit, two years after distribution.7 If the median
functional survival of pyrethroid LLINs is two years, then PBO nets may remain cost-competitive.
WHO requires LLIN manufacturers to provide data from three longitudinal field evaluations in different
ecologies e.g. West Africa, East Africa and Asia that is used to evaluate LLINs for Prequalification (PQ) listing.
While it is recognized that durability is context specific, using the WHO methodology outlined16,17, it is possible
to routinely generate median functional survival estimates and EAC for at least three locations during PQ
evaluation, albeit with a more limited sample size than the present study. The EAC may be a useful metric to
compare between products, rather than assessing products based simply on a minimum threshold as is current
practice. The role of durability data in LLIN procurement has been side-lined and consideration of its
importance in vector control by WHO may re-awaken the LLIN market to reward more durable products that
will in turn create incentives for investments in technological advances, research and development by ITN
manufacturers.5,17
Attrition and physical integrity, the two factors that define functional survival of LLINs,2 differed significantly
between the three net products. Olyset demonstrated more rapid accumulation of damage and more rapid
attrition. In the current study and in previous work we demonstrated that most LLINs were discarded because
they were perceived as too damaged to offer protection against mosquito bites or malaria.18 Further
consideration should be given to developing simple tools to allow countries to assess attrition and fabric
integrity during routine surveys to inform planning since it is clear that these two outcomes are both most
important in predicting LLIN functional life, are highly variable between contexts and are simpler to collect than
bioefficacy or chemical content data.
Of those nets still present after three years, 25-40% were categorized as no longer physically serviceable,
depending on the brand. However, even after three years, nets remained highly efficacious when tested by
bioassays against insecticide-susceptible malaria vectors. Damage actually increased the mortality of
mosquitoes that had entered nets through holes and become trapped, as also observed in other studies.19 Indeed,
torn LLINs continue to provide both individual and community protection from malaria.20,21 Our IACT
experiments, demonstrated that the three brands were all highly protective, although Olyset killed significantly
fewer mosquitoes than PermaNet 2.0 and NetProtect. It is of note that most damage to the nets is on the bottom
section from where they are tucked under a mat or mattress. The act of tucking makes these holes inaccessible to
mosquitoes even though the net appears as badly damaged to the user.
However, it is a limitation of the presented study that only susceptible mosquitoes were used for bioefficacy
testing as pyrethroid resistance is widespread and increases feeding success and reduces mortality of mosquitoes.19
Another limitation is the fact that the study was only conducted in Tanzania and LLIN durability does vary by
location. Furthermore, this study was conducted on only three brands of LLINs, all of which are treated with
pyrethroids. As new LLINs products come on the market especially those with new insecticides e.g. PBO nets it
will be imperative to monitor their comparative durability to ensure that the most cost- effective products are
procured for malaria control.

It was demonstrated that nets that are still in households, despite holes, are still protective against mosquito bites
and continue to kill mosquitoes, providing personal and community protection. However, if nets are discarded,
or no longer used because they are perceived as too damaged, then they have no public health benefit at all.
While it is possible to encourage users to retain their damaged but still insecticidal nets through behavioural
change communication (BCC) a more effective strategy will be to distribute more physically durable LLINs.22
LLINs are the largest single item on the global malaria control budget. Most are distributed through mass
campaigns.3 More durable LLINs would reduce the required frequency of campaigns and thus the operational
costs of distribution per person-year of coverage. It is technically feasible to manufacture more durable LLINs.
However, this will happen only if buyers consider cost-effectiveness for coverage 14 and demonstrate a preference
for longer-lasting and better value-for-money products, rather than considering only the unit price.

Methods:
The study has been described in detail previously.23 It took place in 8 districts in Tanzania, selected to be
representative of national environmental, ecological and epidemiological settings (Figure 3). Within each district,
10 villages were randomly selected, and within each village 45 households were recruited to participate in the
study. All households were randomised to receive one of three LLIN brands on a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by village.
The three brands were Olyset® (permethrin incorporated in 150 denier polyethylene; Sumitomo Chemicals,
Japan), PermaNet®2.0 (deltamethrin coated on 100 denier polyester; Vestergaard Frandsen, Switzerland), or
NetProtect® (deltamethrin incorporated into 110 denier polyethylene; BestNet, Denmark). Distribution of study
nets took place between October and December 2013. All nets owned by the participating households were
collected and replaced with enough nets to cover all sleeping spaces. Before distribution, a sample of ten nets per
product was quality tested. Nets were the same size and colour, labelled by a five-digit serial number so that
participants and investigators remained blinded to the LLIN product until data collection was complete. In total,
3,393 households were randomised (1,132 to Olyset, 1,127 to PermaNet 2.0 and 1,134 to NetProtect) to which
10,571 nets were distributed (Trial Characteristics Table S1).
Surveys were conducted among all consenting study households when the LLINs were distributed and at three
follow up points: 10 months (August – October 2014), 22 months (August – October 2015) and 36 months
(October – December 2016) (Study Flow Table S8). Serial numbers of nets, linked to household identifying codes
in a master list, enabled follow-up of each net at each time point. At each follow up visit information on each
LLIN was collected, including whether the net was present in the house, reasons why it was not present, and
whether the net was in use. Physical integrity of LLINs was measured on a random sample of three nets per
household by counting the number, location and size of holes.16,17 Socio-economic variables and a household
member roster were also recorded. Electronic data capture was used for all surveys.
In addition to the data collected as part of the household surveys, at each time point 48 LLINs from each brand
were randomly sampled from the master list and returned to the laboratory in Bagamoyo, Tanzania for
bioefficacy and chemical analysis using standard WHO methods16,17 and additional Ifakara Ambient Chamber
Test (IACT).24 Table 4 describes the different components of LLIN durability, the test conducted to obtain the
data, the outcome indicators for statistical analysis and the corresponding WHO threshold criteria.4,16,17 The
numbers of LLINs tested for each of the components of LLIN durability are listed in Table S8.
First, the protective efficacy of whole nets returned from the field was evaluated using IACT.24 Each night, ten
male volunteers slept underneath one of the nets (or an untreated control net to monitor the quality of the bioassay)
between 21.00 – 6.00hrs in a small chamber similar in size to a bedroom, within a screened compartment. At
21.00hrs, 30 laboratory-reared mosquitoes were released into the chamber. The next morning, all mosquitoes
within the compartment were recaptured, and scored for 24-hour mortality and blood-feeding inhibition. Each
LLIN was tested twice on two consecutive nights. Subsequently, net pieces (25x25cm2) were cut following the
WHO sampling pattern and standard WHO cone bioassays were carried out.16 If nets did not meet WHO optimal
bioefficacy criteria for cone tests (Table 4), WHO tunnel tests were conducted.16 Insecticide content analyses were
performed using standard CIPAC methods for LLIN insecticide content (Olyset: 331/LN/M/3, PermaNet 2.0
333/LN/(M)/3, NetProtect 333/LN/(M2)/3). All mosquito assays were conducted with fully pyrethroidsusceptible 2-8-day old nulliparous female Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (Ifakara strain).

Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata Statistical Software: Release 13 (StataCorp LP, TX). Attrition
and functional survival (Table 4) were calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimators. For both endpoints, nets
reported as given away, sold or stolen were treated as lost to follow up. Hazard ratios for the difference in attrition
and functional survival were calculated using discrete time survival analysis using a complementary log-log
model.25 Robust standard errors were used to account for the highest level of clustering (district).26 Of nets that
were present, net condition was defined, following WHO recommendations, as either being “good”, “damaged”
(combined to be “serviceable”), or “too torn/unserviceable” (Table 4). Negative binomial regression was used to
compare hole surface area between net products. A Chi-squared test assessed the proportion of nets of each
product passing the WHO bioefficacy criteria based on combined cone and tunnel tests, adjusted for control
mortality. Logistic regression was used to analyse mortality and blood feeding inhibition from the IACT test;
results were adjusted for chamber and experimental night and robust standard errors were used to take account of
nets being tested multiple times.
Economic Analysis
The equivalent annual cost (EAC) of an LLIN was calculated according to the standard formula.27 To assess the
value of longer functional survival we used Equation 1 where b is the ratio of the lifespan of the more durable

product to the lifespan of reference net n. The variable r is the discount rate. This relationship shows that for any
change in net lifespan from n to bn the relative increase in price, a, which would yield an identical EAC for the
two products. Other factors being equal a relative price increase less than a would favour the new, longer-lasting
LLIN, while relative price increases greater than a would favour the standard reference net.

#$(#&'))*+
#$(#&'))+

Simulation of EACs for products tested in the study was conducted using Monte Carlo methods, assuming a 3%
discount rate, as is standard in health economic analysis. The baseline survival function for LLINs was estimated
by regressing the survival proportions of Olyset nets derived from Kaplan-Meier analysis (Table S4) against time.
The survival function was converted into a baseline hazard and net failure lifetimes were simulated for a cohort
of 500 LLINs assuming a Weibull distribution of times to failure (in terms of functional survival). The results of
the cohort were summarised by estimating the median lifetime and this process was repeated 10,000 times for
each net type, yielding an estimate of the expected median lifetime and quantiles of its expected distribution.
Results were converted into EACs with 95% quantiles. Distributional assumptions for the baseline hazard and the
parameters of the Weibull distribution were fitted to the results presented in Table 1. The baseline hazard and
proportional hazard were simulated with log normal distributions (Table S9).
Ethics
Ethical approval was granted from ethical review committees at London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine
(6333/A443), Ifakara Health Institute (IHI/IRB/AMM/ No: 07- 2014) and the Tanzanian National Institute for
Medical Research (NIMR/HQ/R.8c/Vol. I/285). Community sensitization meetings were held prior to study
inception and written informed consent was obtained from the head of the household, or another adult household
member of participating households before each survey. Human volunteers for the IACT experiment were all IHI
staff members with appropriate training who gave written informed consent.
