Abstract
Alcohol consumption, a risk factor for suicide, is associated with changes in DNA methylation,
which may play a role in the pathophysiology of suicidality. Here, Mendelian randomization
probes whether alcohol-associated changes in DNA methylation mediate risk for suicidal
behavior. The results suggest that higher alcohol-associated DNA methylation levels at
cg18120259 confer a weak causal effect. cg18120259 is instrumented by a cis-methylation
quantitative trait locus (rs9472155) that is upstream of VEGFA and associated with circulating
VEFG levels. To ascertain whether the cg18120259 finding is confounded by VEGF levels, a
Mendelian randomization of VEGF levels on suicidality was performed, revealing a null effect.
This implies circulating VEGF levels (observed among suicide attempters) may mark but not
cause suicide. Both mechanisms should be re-examined in large replication studies, as the
information might be harnessed for early detection of at-risk individuals and possibly save lives.

Alcohol consumption is a strong risk factor for suicide1 and is associated with changes in DNA
methylation2 and chronic inflammation3, both of which may play a role in the pathophysiology
of suicidality. Lower plasma concentrations of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) have
been documented for suicide attempters versus controls4. The present paper uses Mendelian
randomization (MR) to investigate whether alcohol-associated changes in DNA methylation
cause suicidal behavior and considers possibilities that could explain the relationships between
changes in DNA methylation, circulating VEGF levels, and suicidality (used throughout to
denote attempts and completions, not suicidal ideation): vertical pleiotropy, horizontal
pleiotropy, and confounding pleiotropy (Fig. 1.).

Fig. 1. Possible pathways that might explain pleiotropy between DNA methylation, VEGF
levels, and suicidal behavior. The pathways depicted here do not preclude confounding by
unmeasured traits. (“CpG” denotes a site in the genome where a cytosine nucleotide is followed
by a guanine nucleotide in the linear sequence of bases. CpGs can be methylated and their levels
measured.)
Conceptual framework. MR is an instrumental variables technique, analogous to a randomizedcontrolled trial. It uses genetic variants (typically single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs)
strongly associated with traits in statistical models instead of traits themselves. Doing so avoids
most environmental sources of confounding and averts reverse causation5–7. Two-sample MR is
an extension of the procedure that uses summary statistics from two genome-wide association
(GWA) studies8–13. For example, the causal effect of DNA (CpG) methylation on suicidality can
be assessed as follows (Fig. 2): Estimates of the SNP-CpG associations (𝛽̂𝑍𝑋 ) are calculated in
Sample 1, a GWA study of DNA methylation levels (SNPs strongly associated with CpG levels
are termed methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL)). The association between these same
SNPs and suicidality (𝛽̂𝑍𝑌 ) are then estimated in a GWA study of a suicidality phenotype

(Sample 2). These estimates are combined into Wald ratios (𝛽̂𝑋𝑌 =𝛽̂𝑍𝑌 /𝛽̂𝑍𝑋 ) to produce a causal
estimate of CpG methylation on suicidality.

Fig. 2. Two-sample MR depicting the use of methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTL) to
instrument DNA methylation (CpG) levels (Sample 1) to test the effect of alcohol-associated
DNA methylation changes on suicidality. mQTL identified in Sample 1 (𝛽̂𝑍𝑋 ) are extracted from
Sample 2 (𝛽̂𝑍𝑌 ). The effect estimates are combined into Wald ratios (𝛽̂𝑋𝑌 =𝛽̂𝑍𝑌 /𝛽̂𝑍𝑋 ).
Mendelian randomization assumptions. Three assumptions must hold for MR to be valid: (i)
the SNPs acting as the instrumental variables must be strongly associated with the exposure; (ii)
the instrumental variables must be independent of confounders of the exposure and the outcome;
and (iii) the instrumental variables must be associated with the outcome only through the
exposure10,14.
Results
Higher alcohol-associated methylation at cg18120259 is suggestively weakly causal for suicide
(OR per beta-level increase in DNA methylation: 1.0005; 95% CI 1.0002, 1.0008; P=0.001).
These findings replicated with a sensitivity test using a closely related ICD-9 outcome GWA
study for suicidality (OR per beta-level increase in DNA methylation: IVW: 1.0003; 95% CI
1.00003, 1.0007; P=0.03). None of the seven remaining CpGs showed evidence for causality
(Table 1).
Sensitivity analyses. The sensitivity analysis of circulating VEGF levels on risk for suicide was
null (Table 2): IVW estimate 1.0000, 95% CI 0.9999, 1.0001; P=0.6776). The sensitivity
analysis for frequency of alcohol consumed with meals on risk for suicide demonstrates a causal
effect for more drinks consumed (OR for suicide per category higher of drinking: IVW estimate
1.0013; 95% CI 1.0002, 1.0024; P=0.0184).

Discussion
Regarding the relationships between DNA methylation, VEGF levels, and suicidality, four
possibilities are considered: (i) VEGF levels could influence suicide through cg18120259

(vertical pleiotropy); (ii) cg18120259 could regulate VEGF levels and hence suicidality (vertical
pleiotropy); (iii) cg18120259 and VEGF levels could have independent, direct influences on
suicidality (horizontal pleiotropy); (iv) and the findings implicating methylation of cg18120259
in suicidality could be explained by confounding from an unmeasured trait; i.e., the
hypermethylation of cg18120259 could be a biomarker associated with a causal trait in
individuals who are at-risk for suicide.
cg18120259 is instrumented by a cis-mQTL (rs9472155) that is associated with VEGF levels.
Since higher methylation levels typically downregulate expression, these findings might imply
that alcohol-associated higher methylation of cg18120259 acts to downregulate VEGFA.
However, from the MR results, there is no evidence for a direct, causal effect of VEGF levels on
risk for suicide, suggesting the lower levels of VEGF that have been previously reported in
suicide attempters are marking but not causing the behavior. This is evidence against
explanations (i), (ii), and (iii); i.e., the finding for hypermethylation of cg18120259 increasing
risk for suicide does not appear to be confounded by VEGF levels or occurring through them.
Because VEGF levels are the only documented trait associated with rs9472155 (Supplementary
Table 15), the null MR provides some evidence against horizontal pleiotropy. Notwithstanding,
the numbers of suicide cases in the two outcome GWA are small. Exploring the possibility that
VEGF confers a causal effect should be reconsidered when more cases are available in public
GWA studies of suicide. Further, the small number of suicide cases for the tests of DNA
methylation on suicidality might also have led to Type 1 error. This possibility is mitigated some
by the replication with the MR analysis of the closely related suicidality phenotype and by the
MR of frequency of alcohol consumed with meals on suicidality, which showed that frequency
of drinking among drinkers does increase risk for suicide. It is unlikely that these separate and
biologically plausible tests performed with three separate outcome GWA studies of suicidality
are chance artefacts.
That leaves confounding by an unmeasured endophenotype (iv). A look-up of rs9472155 in the
UCSC Genome Browser reveals that it is at transcription factor binding site for the estrogen
receptor alpha (ERα), encoded by ESR1 (6q25.1)15. However, while estrogen has been
hypothesized to play a role in the pathophysiology of suicidality, a case-control study examining
genetic variants in ESR1 among suicide attempters and healthy controls found no evidence that
ERα contributes strongly to the risk for suicide16. Thus, while a limitation of the present study is
that computational methods to test pleiotropy directly were unavailable for investigation of DNA
methylation, probing biologically plausible confounders revealed little evidence for confounding
(iv). Since the possibility cannot be ruled out, hypermethylation of cg18120259 could be a
biomarker that tags a true underlying causal factor or itself a molecular driver of alcoholassociated suicide. Either way, should these preliminary findings replicate in future studies, this
information might be harnessed for early detection of at-risk individuals, thereby possibly
reducing the burden of suicide – it could help save lives.
A strength of this study is that there is unlikely to be much participant overlap between the
exposure and outcome GWA studies used in the primary two-sample MR designs17. This means
that bias from sample overlap is minimized.

Future MR investigations of alcohol-associated DNA methylation changes on suicidality would
best be done using multivariable MR – with full summary data for alcohol-induced DNA
methylation and full summary data of VEGF levels (currently not available publicly) – and
include an outcome GWA of suicidality that includes more cases. Multivariable MR would
permit a formal statistical assessment of the pleiotropy between DNA methylation and VEGF.
Though the sensitivity analyses here already do this, including more cases would reduce
concerns for both Type 1 and 2 error from a possible lack of statistical power.
Methods
70 CpGs associated with alcohol consumption in 1,135 European American male veterans were
extracted from the manuscript by Xu et al. (2019) (Supplementary Table 3)2. To determine
whether the CpGs were associated with cis-methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs), the list
of 70 CpGs were uploaded to the mQTL database (http://www.mqtldb.org/)18, revealing that 8/70
CpGs have cis-mQTLs associated with them at genome-wide significance (P < 5 x 10-8)
(Supplementary Tables 4-5). Trans-mQTLs were excluded. Summary statistics for these eight
CpGs functioned as data sources for SNP-CpG associations and used in two-sample Mendelian
randomization (MR). For each of the eight CpG instruments, only cis-mQTLs that were
independent (those not in linkage disequilibrium, LD; R2 < 0.01) were kept.
A genome-wide association (GWA) study performed by the Neale lab19 on UK Biobank data
field 4120520,21 for ICD-9 code E9500 (“suicide, self-inflicted poisoning by analgesics,
antipyretics, antirheumatics) was accessed via MR-Base (http://www.mrbase.org/)8 and served as
the outcome data source for the SNP-suicidality associations (sample size=462,859 of which 151
were cases). Harmonized SNP-CpG and SNP-outcome associations were analyzed as Wald ratios
or combined with the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method when more than one SNP
instrumented a CpG site (Fig. 2). This was done within the “TwoSampleMR” package8. To
correct for running eight tests, a Bonferroni threshold was set to P<0.006 (0.05/8). Analyses were
performed in in R version 3.5.2. All data sources used for SNP-CpG and SNP-suicidality
associations are publicly available.
Sensitivity analyses. None of the DNA methylation instruments contained a sufficient number
of SNPs to perform typical MR sensitivity analyses for pleiotropy, such as MR-Egger regression.
To address this, a second two-sample MR was run as a replication for each instrument using a
different UK Biobank ICD-9 code for a closely related suicidality phenotype (E9503: “suicide
and self-inflicted poisoning by tranquillizers, other psychotropic agents”; sample size=462,569
of which 141 are cases). In addition, PhenoScanner, a curated database of GWA studies
containing SNP-phenotype associations, was used to ascertain potential pleiotropic confounders
for the SNP instrument for cg18120259 (rs9472155)22,23. PhenoScanner revealed that the SNP
instrumenting cg18120259 (rs9472155) is associated with VEGF, altered levels of which have
been documented in those who attempt suicide. Therefore, to investigate the possibility that
alcohol-induced DNA methylation at cg18120259 is confounded by the influence of VEGF, an
MR of VEGF levels on suicidality was performed as a sensitivity test. For this, an instrument for
circulating VEGF levels was constructed from a GWA study of 3,527 individuals of European
descent in the Framingham Heart Study24.
The number of cases of suicide are small. To probe the possibility that outcome GWA with few
cases of suicide could be used with biologically probable hypotheses, a final sensitivity test was

performed among those who consume alcohol. In the UK Biobank, those who indicated they
consumed alcohol were asked how frequently they drank with meals (data field 1618; sample
size 172,454). An MR of frequency of drinking with meals on suicidality was run using a GWA
for ICD-9 code E9509: “Suicide and self-inflicted poisoning by other/unspecified solid and
liquid substances” (the primary UK Biobank ICD-9 code E9509 GWA was performed by the
Neale lab19).
The same methods for instrument construction listed above for the DNA methylation instruments
were used to instrument VEGF levels and frequency of alcohol consumed with meals.
Instrument strength. F-statistics, which provide a measure of instrument strength, and R2
statistics (how much variance in a trait is explained by an instrument)25 were calculated for each
primary test (Table 3). F-statistics <10 are weak26. All instruments used in this analysis are aptly
strong. Detailed characteristics of proxies for all instruments are available in Supplementary
Tables 6-14, and 16.
