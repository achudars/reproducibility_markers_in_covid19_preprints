Abstract
We conducted a scoping review on psilocybin-assisted therapy for addiction, depression,
anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder. Psilocybin is a naturally-occurring tryptophan
derivative found in species of mushroom with psycho-active properties. From 2022 records
identified by database searching, 40 publications were included in the qualitative synthesis from
which we identified 9 clinical trials with a total of 169 participants. Trials used a peakpsychedelic model of therapy, emphasizing inward journey through the use of eyeshades, set
musical scores and with medium to high doses of psilocybin. No serious adverse effects were
reported; mild adverse effects included transient anxiety, nausea and post-treatment
headaches. Overall, the 9 trials all demonstrated safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in
the treatments of obsessive-compulsive disorder, substance use disorder, treatment-resistant
unipolar depression, anxiety or depression in patients with life-threatening cancer and
demoralization among long-term AIDS survivors.The literature was found to be early and
exploratory, with several limitations: only 5 were randomized controlled trials, small and
homogenous patient sample size, difficulties in blinding, and the confounding influence of
psychological supports provided. Further research is indicated to establish effectiveness for
these and other indications, with a more diverse range of patients, and with differing program
and dosing modalities.

Introduction
Psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine) is a naturally-occurring tryptamine
indolealkylamine and a prodrug to psilocin (4-Hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), a central
serotonin 5HT2A receptor agonist. Along with Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and N, NDimethyltryptamine (DMT), psilocybin is considered a classic serotonergic hallucinogen,
psychedelic. First isolated and identified in 1958 by Albert Hoffman from the strain Psilocybe
Mexicana (Hoffman, 1958), psilocybin is the main psychoactive molecule found in “magic
mushrooms”. Sacramental use of the Psilocybe genus of gilled fungi in Mesoamerica has been
dated to 500 BC (Guerra-Doce, 2015), with shamanic ceremonial traditions documented among
many indigenous groups throughout central-southern Mexico, as well as among the Yurimagua
of Peru (Schultes et al., 1992, Guzman, 2008, McKenna & Riba, 2015)
Onset of action for psilocybin is 20-40 minutes after oral ingestion, with peak levels experienced
after 60–90 minutes; the overall duration is 4–6 hours for oral administration (Tylša et al., 2013).
Psilocin is largely excreted after 3 hours, and completely eliminated after 24; half-life is 2.5
hours. (Hasler et al., 2002; Tylša et al., 2013). Psilocybin has a very high safety ratio and a low
risk profile even in unsupervised, naturalistic settings (Schenberg, 2018, Nutt et al., 2010).
Serotonin receptors regulate a range of processes including learning and memory, sleep and
wake cycles, thermoregulation, appetite, sexual behaviour, pain, motor activity and aspects of
autonomic function (Flanagan & Nichols, 2018). Nichols identifies the 5-HT2AR, principally
expressed in the cortex (Pazos et al., 1987) as the key site of action, conjecturing that the novel
patterns of global neurological interconnectivity produced by psilocybin, when combined with the
appropriate clinical preparation and setting, can result in a subsequent, beneficial “rewiring” of
brain networks away from previous pathological patterns and more similar to pre-disease states.
(Nichols et al., 2017).
Recent investigations have indicated that the phenotypic expression of the 5-HT2AR genotypes
is bound to and dependent on environmental context (Jokela et al. 2007), and this sensitivity to
setting is integral to the functioning of 5-HT2A signalling (Carhart-Harris & Nutt, 2017).
Psychedelic therapy has long paid heed to the importance of both set — personality, mindset,
affect, expectations (Metzner and Leary, 1967) and setting (Leary, Litwin & Metzner R. 1963,
Hartogsohn, 2017). The triad of drug, set and setting is foundational to understanding the total
drug effect of any psycho-active substance (Zinberg, 1984) and central to harm reduction
(McElrath and McEvoy, 2002; Shewan et al., 2000).
Previous reviews have been published summarizing research about the clinical potential of
serotonergic psychedelics (Dos Santos 2016, Reiche et al. 2018, Schenberg 2018, Studeris
2011), including psilocybin (Johnson and Griffiths, 2017). We conducted a scoping review to
identify, summarize and map the literature on psilocybin-assisted therapeutic trials. Scoping
reviews, guided by an established, rigorous and replicable methodology (Arksey and O’Malley
2005) are used to map the nature, features and volume of existing literature in a given field,
helping to clarify existing working definitions and conceptual boundaries. (Peters, 2015).
Scoping reviews provide a basis in evidence for the evolution of both research and clinical
practice, in this case by understanding the patients selected, the interventions used, and the
outcomes noted for psilocybin-assisted therapies. Our scoping review was guided by the
research question, “what are the treatment variables and outcomes associated with psilocybinassisted therapy?”

Methods
This scoping review search was specific to: anxiety, depression, substance use disorder and
post-traumatic stress disorder. Variables included both patient and intervention characteristics.
Outcomes included any documented changes in health status and both positive and negative
outcomes noted.
A comprehensive search approach (Appendix 1) was used to locate published and unpublished
studies. A preliminary search was conducted in Ovid MEDLINE using a combination of
keywords and subject headings, followed by an analysis of relevant citations to identify
additional relevant keywords and subject headings. A refined search using all identified
keywords and subject headings was then executed in Ovid MEDLINE (1946 onward) and
translated in the following resources: Ovid Embase (1947 onward), PsycINFO (1806 onward),
EBM Reviews: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (1991-present), Web of Science
Core Collection (1900 onward), and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses (1861 onward).
Database searches were conducted in December 2018 and updated in October 2019; no
language or date restrictions were applied though non-English texts would eventually be
excluded. Finally, the reference lists of all eligible reports and articles were hand-searched to
identify any additional studies.
From records identified through database screening and using Covidence online software,
duplications were removed, records screened, assessed for eligibility and included or excluded
from full-text review (Table 1.) Inclusion criteria were: psilocybin, therapy/treatment, outcomes
measured. Exclusion criteria were: duplicate publication, not research study, no outcomes
measured, no therapeutic goal, not about psilocybin, naturalistic/recreational use, or
microdosing. Reviewers read the full text of selected studies and each extracted data using an
original data extraction tool. Reviewers cross-checked for homogenous process quality control
and consensus was necessary when conflicts arose.

Results
Database searching identified 2022 potential articles; 1277 remained after duplicates were
removed and from these 185 articles were subjected to full-text review. 145 articles were
excluded for not meeting inclusion criteria, leaving 40 published studies included in the review.

Table 1. PRISMAFlow Diagram
Of the 40 articles, 9 were identified as original clinical trials; the remaining 31 articles are
secondary investigations pertaining to the core trials, or follow-ups to original trials. 5 of the 9
studies used a controlled trial methodology. Of the 9 studies, 7 are completed and 2 are ongoing
with published preliminary data. Of the completed trials, a total of 169 participants were
enrolled, with 106 (70.2%) enrolled in controlled trials and 97 of these (64.2%) enrolled in trials
pertaining to cancer-related anxiety and depression. Other presenting conditions studied include
obsessive compulsive disorder, tobacco addiction, alcohol use disorder, treatment resistant
depression and demoralization among long-term AIDS survivors.(Table 2.)

Table 2. Comparative table of key study characteristics of the results of eight psilocybinassisted therapy trials. aStudy is ongoing. PSI = Preparation, Support, and Integration, CBT =
Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, MET = Motivational Enhancement Therapy.
Of the 5 randomized control trials, 3 followed a crossover design, 1 was a parallel design, and 1
a modified escalating-dose design. In the crossover studies, each patient was exposed to both
active placebo (niacin, diphenhydramine, or a very low dose of psilocybin) and an experimental
dose of psilocybin in two sessions which varied between 1 and 7 weeks apart.
The trials themselves ranged in cohort sizes from 9 to 56 and the studies themselves lasted
from 4 to 57 weeks (where reported). Each trial used a similar approach to psilocybin dosage
and the setting for dose administration sessions. All trials used a synthetic formulation of
psilocybin administered orally and largely in the medium to high dose ranges (25-40mg/70 kg).;
dosage was calculated by one of three methods: mg, mg/k or mg/70kg.. The majority of trials
administered psilocybin in multiple sessions (up to 3), separated by at least 1 week, and starting
with lower doses (Table 3. Timeline of Psilocybin Trials). Sessions lasted up to 8 hours, and
some trials provided overnight accommodation and all provided medical oversight and symptom
management. Data was collected by various standardized tools and metrics including selfreport, clinical assessment and biomarkers; one trial included brain imaging by fMRI.

Table 3. A comparative timeline of the eight reported psilocybin-assisted therapy trials. Each grid
represents one week. All doses are in mg/70kg psilocybin except for Carhart-Harris et al. (2016) which is in mg. aDoses
progressively escalated between sessions. 1.75 mg/70kg placebo was randomly given in one of four sessions and time between
sessions varied from 1-2 weeks. bParticipants received niacin placebo (250 mg) in one of two sessions. cParticipants given an
optional third high-dose session. dOriginal dose of 21 mg/70kg psilocybin was used in second session if participant preferred,
there would be a significant risk, or the patient reported a complete mystical experience. eParticipants randomly assigned to lowdose session first (placebo-like) or high-dose session first, then crossed over for the following session. fParticipants allocated to
control group first (niacin 250 mg) or experimental group first (21 mg/70kg psilocybin), then crossed over for the following
session. gParticipants received either 25 mg/70 kg psilocybin vs. 50 mg diphenhydramine in the first session, and in the second
session, depending on response, 30 or mg/70 kg psilocybin vs. 100 mg diphenhydramine. All participants were offered an
additional third open-label psilocybin session from 25-40mg/70 kg. hPatients were given four group-based preparatory sessions,
one dosing session (21 mg/70 kg), followed by six group-based integration sessions.

The majority of trials provided significant levels of therapy including preparation and integration,
but also general psychological supports and, in the case of substance use disorder, additional
therapies specific to addiction. Only the Grob (Grob et al., 2011) and Moreno (Moreno et al.,
2006) trials did not report including psychotherapy or psychological supports. After varying
degrees of preparation, trial subjects were given an oral dose of synthetic psilocybin in a quiet,
protected and comfortable setting. Trials used curated musical playlists, eyeshades, and
encouraged subjects to, in the words of one trial investigator “trust, let go, and be
open” (Griffiths, et al., 2016). Where reported, trials included two guides (usually of differing
genders), or sitters, who would accompany the subject through the sessions in an noninterventional, and supportive manner, later to debrief and help integrate the contents of the
session. Overall, subjects tended to be middle aged, with mean ages between 40-53 where
reported, and often had previous experience with psychedelics (Table 3).

Table 4. Comparative table of participant demographics of 9 psilocybin-assisted therapy
trials. aStudy is ongoing
In addition to the characteristics and outcomes reported in our summary tables, several
reportable and common themes emerged from the literature. Those themes can be clustered
into 5 distinct but related categorical statements.
1.

Strength of the Subjective Psilocybin Experience Predicts Positive Treatment
Outcomes

One finding consistent across several of the trials was that the intensity of psilocybin experience
is strongly correlated with positive treatment outcomes. The acute subjective experience of the
trial subject is the focus of many of the metrics employed, most commonly measured in Oceanic
Boundlessness (OB), Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) and Altered States of Consciousness
scales. Many of the trial subjects report mystical-type experiences characterized by a deep
sense of oneness and interconnectivity. Not all the trials found high rates of mystical experience
however. In the Bogenshutz (2015) study on alcohol use disorder, only 3 of the 17 (17.6%)
participants had mysticomimetic experiences, perhaps indicating a possible blunting effect from
alcohol dependence. In general however, attributions of meaning or positive experience both
correlated with improved clinical outcomes.
2.

Psilocybin experiences are Rich, Highly Variable, Personalized and Memorable

All trials reported wide variation in experience among the subjects, but certain experiences were
common to the phenomenology of psilocybin: awe, curiosity, connectedness, natural wonder,
gratefulness, humility, oneness, compassion, love, acceptance, nature relatedness, optimism,
forgiveness and acceptance were commonly referenced, and subjects generally rated the
experience as intense, memorable while program staff observed wide variation of experience,
with each unique to the history, personality, and life situation of the subject. Positive attribution
towards the psilocybin session was found to remain high upon long-term follow up.
3.

Transient Psychological Distress During Psilocybin Sessions is Common and
Normative as are Post-session Headaches

No serious or life-threatening adverse effects were experienced in any of the trials significant
enough to question the safety of psilocybin in a controlled setting. However, transient side
effects during psilocybin sessions, often experienced as challenging, were reported: acute
reactions of confusion, fear, paranoia, anxiety, nausea, headache, disorientation and transient
psychological distress were reported in as much as 40% of trial subjects were reported across
several trials. Significantly, several trials found post-treatment headaches to be common in
40-50% of subjects. (Grob, et al., 2011, Carhart-Harris, et al, 2016); a pattern of dosedependent, delayed and transient headaches has been documented in healthy volunteers
administered psilocybin (Johnson et al., 2011).

4.

Psilocybin May Alter Characteristics of Personality

Experiences under psilocybin tended to give participants lasting, sustained insights leading to
shifts in self-identity. Psilocybin trial participants experienced alterations to traits of personality—
increased openness, extraversion and conscientiousness, decreased authoritarian political
views. Traits of empathy, openness, optimism and conscientiousness were markedly improved;
in contrast anhedonia, pessimism, fear and authoritarian political views were all found to
decrease. Many subjects experienced decrease neuroticism, and a increases in acceptance
resulted in experiences of forgiveness, release or acceptance of one’s life.
5.

Psilocybin is an Experience of Meaning-Making

Many trial subjects had experiences under psilocybin that remained significant and meaningful
when measured for up to 18 months. Many reported being able to see problems from new
perspectives, and to see how they could change the narrative of their lives. Many reported being
able to see their lives from a bigger, and more supported, perspective. The fear of death, for
many, was lessened by insight into their place in life, and of the experience of a spirit or
presence not dependent on the body. Many subjects reported their psilocybin experiences as
among the top 5 meaningful experiences of their lives.
6.

Program Variables and Psychological Supports Play a Significant Role in
Treatment Outcomes

Subjects were asked about their response to the music playlists which accompany the dosing
sessions, with feedback on both favourable and unfavourable experiences. Music was found to
help guide a session, and could heighten emotional response, but many subjects reported
dissatisfaction with either the choice, or timing of music played. Subjects were found to have a
generally good rapport with program staff, and many cited their relationships with program staff
as important to their experience. Sensitivity to setting is a characteristic of the psilocybin
experience, and trial protocols ensured a comfortable, relaxed setting.
What emerges from the scoping review is a new but relatively consistently applied
experientially-oriented psycho-pharmacotherapy, best combined with psychological supports
and conducted in a thoughtful, appropriate setting. A relative consensus emerges of a medium
to high dose protocol, with an escalation of dosage over 2-3 treatment sessions, prefaced by
intensive psychological preparation and post-treatment integration.

Discussion
Trials reported several limitations which significantly limit the generalizability of findings. Several
of the trials were not controlled, but rather open label exploratory trials to determine safety and
efficacy. In addition, several of the trials included a significant number of widespread metrics
and multiple assessment tools, indicating a lack of specificity in identifying mechanisms of
action. Consistently and despite various approaches, trials reported a strong difficulty in truly
blinding and staff due to the obvious effects of psilocybin. Even the lower doses of psilocybin
were found impossible to blind.
Cancer trials showed the highest level of methodological rigour, as each used a controlled
crossover design. The nature of the crossover design in the included clinical trials led to
reported unblinding of both participant and investigator, allowing for influencing of expectations
(Grob et al., 2011; Griffiths et al., 2016, Ross et al., 2016) and limited the assessment of efficacy
and clinical benefit after the crossing over of treatments (Griffiths et al., 2016; Ross et al., 2016).
Crossover designs which employ a placebo also suffer from the potential of carryover effects for
the experiment-first, placebo-second group. This can be minimized through a wash-out period,
which varied between one to seven weeks for the three studies (Grob et al., 2011; Griffiths et
al., 2016, Ross et al., 2016).
Trials also tended to have very small subject sample sizes. The relatively homogenous patient
demographics limit the generalizability of the psilocybin trial findings. It is not clear if this
modality would be effective with patients characterized by greater mental health co-morbidity,
marginalization, poverty, instability or relative youth. Trials reported common exclusion criteria:
personal or family history of schizophrenia/other psychotic disorders or bipolar disorders,
personal cocaine, psycho-stimulant or opioid dependence, or family history of suicide. RCTs will
remain challenging due to the difficulty in blinding study participants, and because of the
confounding variable of the psychotherapies provided.
Psychological therapies given in addition to the psilocybin session confound the study
outcomes, if what we are assessing is the therapeutic potential of psilocybin. Further, it must be
asked if the peak psychedelic model is the only viable practice model to investigate; regimens of
lower doses, plus collective group models, remain to be studied. Psilocybin at microdoses also
requires more rigorous investigation. A recent systematic study found microdosing improves
mood, energy levels and cognition, creativity, optimism and openness, as well as alters
perceptions of time (Polito & Stevenson, 2019) and a recent self-report study of microdosers
found reductions in depression, stress and distractibility with increased absorption and
neuroticism (Anderson, et al., 2019). Smaller sub-perceptual doses would allow for more
relaxed trial inclusion criteria, and could be possibly be used in the treatment of PTSD given the
role of low-dose psilocybin in reducing fear response in laboratory animals (Catlow et al., 2013).
The ayahausca church model has been associated with lower rates of substance use disorder
and overall improvements in health. (McKenna, 2004, Barbosa, Mizumoto, Bogenschutz &
Strassman, 2012, Fabregas et al. 2010) while ceremonial peyote rituals have been proposed as
a model of ethnopharmacologic treatment for alcohol and other forms of substance use disorder
(Prue, 2013, Blum et al. 1977). Collective ritual ceremony has the added benefits of
socialization, peer support and structure, all factors thought to be beneficial in the process of
recovery and all characteristic of the 12-step recovery model. Further, while much has been
made of the potential for psilocybin to induce mystical-type experiences (Griffiths et al. 2006,

2008), studies have found this to be not always be the norm; Cummins and Lyke (2013) found
47% of naturalistic users to report peak experiences while under psilocybin. Subjects reported a
range of powerful experiences in these trials; meaningful and often challenging but not always
mystical. A more sophisticated mapping of consciousness and understanding of altered states
remain necessary.
An assessment of registered NCT trials (Table 3.) identified a further 16 new clinical trials active,
recruiting or planned in the U.S. and Europe. In a notable shift, 9 of these new trials follow
randomized, double blind parallel designs. Parallel designs give the advantage of avoiding
carryover effects. They are also favoured in larger studies; the newer trials are trending to be
larger than those reviewed here; they range in target sample size from 18-216 (mean, 66). One
currently recruiting trial uses psilocybin in the treatment of headaches, building on earlier
indications that chronic migraine sufferers or those with cluster headaches report relief via selfmedication with psilocybin as well as LSD (Sewell et al., 2006); another recruiting trial for the
treatment of cocaine use disorder is the first of it’s kind.

Table 5. Overview of ongoing psilocybin-assisted therapy trials. aAs of November 2nd 2019
Popular interest in the potential benefit of serotonergic psychedelics will necessitate new
models of policy, regulation and practice. Haden (Haden et al. 2016) has proposed a public
health model of oversight including the regulation of a new classification of psychedelic
therapists. Training programs, certification and manuals remain to be developed. The current
prohibition of psilocybin (as well as other classic psychedelics) remains a barrier to science:
researchers must currently apply for difficult and time-consuming special access and many
countries may lack domestic suppliers. Following cannabis, the decriminalization patterns newly
evidenced may evolve more quickly than the scientific research, necessitating the rapid
development of evidence-based practice models and indications for use while we continue to
investigate the potential clinical benefits by rigorous scientific method. The therapeutic potential
of psilocybe mushrooms may not be limited to the psilocybin compound alone; psilocin,
baeocystin, norbaeocystin, aerguinascin and norpsilocin are also found in psilocybe mushrooms
and may themselves have value alone or in entourage.

Conclusion
The psilocybin trials have demonstrated safety, tolerability and efficacy in treating a range of
mood and self-regulatory disorders, indicating a common underlying basis to distinct
pathologies. Outcomes are positive both in the studied reductions of problematic behaviours,
but also in the sustained elevation of mood. Adverse effects are rare, though common side
effects include transient anxiety, nausea and post-treatment headaches.The psilocybin trials
have established a marked ability to interrupt disordered psycho-pathological processes and to
lead to improvements in health behaviours. The mechanism of action is not yet fully understood.
Current legal prohibition on psilocybin hinders basic science and continued clinical investigation.
The use of psychedelics represents a paradigm shift in our approach to disorders of mental
health (Nichols, et al., 2017, Schenbert 2018), including addiction (Morgan et al., 2017). The
promise of psilocybin therapy rests in it’s apparent ability to disrupt dysphoric mood states and
obsessive or compulsive self-regulatory disorders. More rigorous scientific study is necessary to
lay the basis for evidence-informed practice.
