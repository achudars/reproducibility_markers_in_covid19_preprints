Abstract

Many available vaccines have demonstrated post-exposure effectiveness, but no published
systematic reviews have synthesized these findings. We searched the PubMed database for
clinical trials and observational human studies concerning the post-exposure vaccination effects,
targeting infections with an FDA-licensed vaccine plus dengue, hepatitis E, malaria, and tick
borne encephalitis, which have licensed vaccines outside of the U.S. Studies concerning animal
models, serologic testing, and pipeline vaccines were excluded. Eligible studies were evaluated
by definition of exposure, and their attempt at distinguishing pre- and post-exposure effects was
rated on a scale of 1-4. We screened 4518 articles and ultimately identified 14 clinical trials and
31 observational studies for this review, amounting to 45 eligible articles spanning 7 of the 28
vaccine-preventable diseases. For secondary attack rate, this body of evidence found the
following medians for post-exposure vaccination effectiveness: hepatitis A: 85% (IQR: 28; 5
sources), hepatitis B: 85% (IQR: 22; 5 sources), measles: 83% (IQR: 21; 8 sources), varicella:
67% (IQR: 48; 9 sources), smallpox: 45% (IQR: 39; 4 sources), and mumps: 38% (IQR: 7; 2
sources). For case fatality proportions resulting from rabies and smallpox, the vaccine efficacies
had medians of 100% (IQR: 0; 6 sources) and 63% (IQR: 50; 8 sources) post-exposure. Although
mainly used for preventive measures, many available vaccines can modify or preclude disease if
administered after exposure. This post-exposure effectiveness could be important to consider
during vaccine trials and while developing new vaccines.
Main text
Introduction
Since the advent of variolation in the early second millennium, vaccination has been
considered a way to prevent healthy individuals from acquiring disease (1). However, in order to
implement informed trials and curb future outbreaks and epidemics, post-exposure effectiveness
must be better understood. Significant efforts have recently been devoted to developing
therapeutic vaccines for treating chronic conditions such as cancer, diabetes, HIV, and obesity
(2), but pre-exposure vaccination remains the focus for communicable disease. One notable

exception is the rabies vaccine, which has seen near total efficacy in exposed individuals for the
past century. The smallpox vaccine also provided well-documented post-exposure prophylaxis
(PEP) until the disease was eradicated 1980, with recommendations dating back to the mid-19th
century (71). However, uncertainty surrounding both exposure status and length of incubation
make post-exposure properties difficult to estimate for any vaccine, and relatively few studies
done so for those that are currently available.
The effectiveness of post-exposure vaccination varies widely depending on disease
course, both in terms of individual immune response and population-level spread. While preexposure vaccination protects uninfected individuals from infection, post-exposure vaccination
serves to modify or prevent clinical disease among those who are already infected. As a result,
post-exposure trials must operate within a constrained timeframe: participants must be identified
and treated between exposure and symptom onset. Measurable benefits may occur if the vaccine
stimulates an immune response faster or larger than that provoked by the natural infection alone.
For smallpox, the vaccine has been shown to induce antibody response 4 to 8 days before the
variola virus, probably because it bypasses the initial respiratory tract stages of a natural
infection (3). These response kinetics explain historical evidence of a post-exposure window and
provide a basis for comparing surrogate models to humans in the case of reemergence (4). For
rabies, though, this explanation has been unable to fully account for the vaccine’s post-exposure
mechanisms. Protection has generally been attributed to neutralizing antibodies, but rabiesexposed patients with HIV have been known to remain well despite poor or undetectable
antibody levels after vaccination (5, 6).
On the community level, post-exposure measures could be instrumental in reducing
disease burden, especially when mass pre-exposure immunization is not feasible. Mathematical
models for tuberculosis have estimated that a post-exposure vaccine would initially be more
effective at reducing disease incidence compared to a preventative vaccine, although over time, a
pre-exposure vaccine would see increasing impact as more uninfected persons were vaccinated
and protected against infection (7). One promising post-exposure candidate, the M72/AS01E
vaccine, recently exhibited 54.0% efficacy against disease among a latently-infected population
(8). While most diseases do not have such a large pool harboring latent infections – nearly a third
of the global population carries tuberculosis – post-exposure vaccination has already curtailed
smaller outbreaks of varicella (42, 46), hepatitis A (47, 48), and measles (57, 62). These diseases

tend to spread widely during outbreaks, but reactive vaccination studies usually operate under
accelerated timeframes and have struggled to distinguish pre- and post-exposure effects. One
approach involves considering only the impact of vaccination on symptoms occurring before one
incubation period following vaccination, which accounts for some of the uncertainty surrounding
exposure status and timing. Variable incubation periods further complicate this method, and
make it especially difficult to draw conclusions about vaccination delays. As a result, the most
robust information results from studies involving a known exposure during a definite interval
prior to vaccination, as is the case for most percutaneous exposures or in settings that practice
quarantine.
In order to address post-exposure effectiveness across multiple diseases, this study
reviews all infections that currently have an FDA-licensed vaccine, plus dengue, hepatitis E,
malaria, and tick borne encephalitis, for which vaccines are available in areas outside the U.S.
(Table 1). The evidence could be useful in informing treatment guidelines, but also concerns the
design and interpretation of more informative vaccine trials. The body of this review evaluates
vaccines administered between exposure and symptom onset, but it also discusses the current
state of research surrounding therapeutic vaccines. These are a subset of post-exposure vaccines
designed to intervene after the onset of clinical disease, and including a brief summary of them
illustrates the broader territory of non-preventive, post-exposure vaccination.
Methods

and their effectiveness after exposure. Search terms for each disease included but were not
limited to:

Studies concerned with animal models, serologic testing, or pipeline vaccines were excluded
from this analysis. In order to ensure demonstration of a post- rather than pre-exposure effect, we
limited consideration to secondary cases either confined to the first incubation period after
vaccination or otherwise attributed to exposure before vaccination. Satisfactory evidence of such
limitation includes recording the time of vaccination and symptom onset within the vaccinated
group, or proving that exposure to the disease ended definitively before vaccination. Most
studies compared secondary attack rates (SAR) between vaccinated and unvaccinated groups, but
for diseases with high rates of infection after exposure such as rabies and smallpox, studies
sometimes looked to fatality proportions among secondary cases as a measure of vaccine
effectiveness. Both types of studies were included, along with reactive vaccination trials that met
our susceptibility and exposure criteria. In order to determine the exposure ratings (defined in the
following section), both authors conducted independent methodological assessments. Any
discrepancies were resolved through discussion.
Definitions
Evidence of post-exposure effectiveness was considered both in terms of secondary
attack and fatality outcomes. The effectiveness itself was defined as the relative reduction in
outcome risk after having been exposed to a pathogen and subsequently vaccinated against it
versus no vaccine or placebo. Because definitions for ‘susceptibility’ and ‘exposure’ vary, the
exact descriptions have been compiled for each report in the supplementary documentation. Most
studies characterized susceptible individuals as those with negative history of vaccination, but
few confirmed with serologic testing. Especially in the case of smallpox, it is thought that prior
immunity was likely underestimated (3). An abridged summary of exposure certainty relative to
vaccination can be found in Table 2. The analysis groups each study within one of the following
four classifications.
Exposure rating:
1. Exposure is uncertain or ongoing without a precise record of timing or timing is followed but
without a control group
2. Study indicates a known point of exposure but offers no explanation for their approach
3. Point of exposure can be inferred with some confidence because timing has been followed
closely and/or it is likely but not explicitly stated that index patients were isolated

4. There is a clear point where exposure occurs, falling before vaccination
The vaccines included target infections with an FDA-licensed vaccine, plus dengue,
hepatitis E, malaria, and tick borne encephalitis, for which vaccines are available in areas outside
of the U.S. These vaccines are referred to as “eligible vaccines” in this report (Table 1). To
illustrate the findings from this review, a maximum delay was calculated for each eligible
vaccine with evidence, defined as the maximum timespan between exposure and vaccination
with at least a 75% effectiveness according to three or more studies. This delay was then
compared to the incubation distribution for each disease according to the CDC (Figure 2). For
the smallpox vaccine, which has been studied using both secondary attack and fatality
proportions as indicators, the included data concern fatality.
Where possible, primary data were re-extracted and recorded in Table 2. We elected not
to meta-analyze results given that the studies and in particular the inclusion criteria and timing of
vaccination were highly heterogeneous for most vaccines, and an “average” effect across such
studies would be difficult to interpret. As all point estimates for all vaccines and all studies
considered were positive, but not all 95% confidence intervals excluded zero, we simply
classified vaccines as those for which statistical evidence of post-exposure protection had been
observed in at least one study, and those for which it had not.
Results
Of the 4518 sources identified, 45 ultimately met inclusion criteria (Figure 1). 434 studies
were reviewed by abstract after preliminary exclusion by title, the majority of which were
excluded for measuring a preventative vaccine effect (330 of 360 clinical trials; 51 of 73
observational studies). After discarding post-exposure studies focused on immunoglobulin or
surrogate models and adding 15 studies found through bibliographies, a total of 14 clinical trials
and 31 observational studies reported data for chickenpox/varicella (38-46), hepatitis A (47-51),
hepatitis B (52-56), measles (57-62), mumps (63-64), rabies (65-70), and smallpox (71-82). No
clinical or observational studies that fit our criteria were located for 21 of the 28 eligible
vaccines, although tetanus and diphtheria toxoids have proven to be effective forms of PEP (1).
All but mumps demonstrated statistical evidence of a positive post-exposure effect in at
least one study. While the effects measured for smallpox were variable and the median lower

than for most other vaccines, reports that stratified by delay after exposure showed a clear
relation between prompt immunization and modified disease course. Vaccine effectiveness
against secondary attack varied in strength across diseases, with medians of 85% (IQR: 28) for
hepatitis A, 85% (IQR: 22) for hepatitis B, 83% (IQR: 21) for measles, 67% (IQR: 48) for
varicella, 45% (IQR: 39) for smallpox, and 38% (IQR: 7) for mumps. These medians exclude the
efficacies estimated using a historical control (labeled “EST” in Table 1), incorporating only
studies with an internal control population. For studies that stratify by vaccination delay (such as
the Sutherland (74) and Dixon (75) smallpox studies), the included estimate refers to the shortest
post-exposure interval. 15 of the 46 studies considered vaccine effectiveness against fatality – 7
for rabies and 8 for smallpox – and determined median vaccine efficacies of 100% (IQR: 0) and
63% (IQR: 50) for the two diseases respectively.
Within these studies, vaccination timing varies widely and must be a factor when
considering these results. According to data in this review, there is an insignificant correlation
between the length of incubation and the length of delay between exposure and vaccination that
allows for ≥75% effectiveness (ρ=.76, p=.08), but it appears that a longer incubation period
allows for a longer delay (Figure 2). Sample populations may also affect vaccine effectiveness:
for instance, evidence for varicella and measles tends to focus on children (7 of 9 and 4 of 6
studies respectively), and hepatitis A on individuals under age 40 (3 of 5 studies). Most data for
these diseases as well as mumps and smallpox derive from reactive vaccination campaigns,
which often saw large enough sample sizes to study. Still, their favorable characteristics
sometimes came at the cost of exposure certainty, such as studies conducted in healthcare (44,
62, 76) and school (46, 51) settings that struggled to determine when exposure occurred. Already
exposure is difficult to trace and isolate in outbreak settings, and many reactive attempts focused
on disrupting an outbreak rather than investigating vaccination as PEP to begin with. Conversely,
percutaneous or mucosal exposure to viruses like hepatitis B and rabies is often much simpler to
identify and link to infection.
Discussion
Of the eligible vaccines with relevant post-exposure evidence, all but mumps show
compelling evidence of some form of post-exposure protection. Previous reviews have already
investigated hepatitis A and B, smallpox, and varicella individually, and while this study is the

first to our knowledge to incorporate multiple diseases, its findings align with those targeted
reports (9, 10, 11, 12, 13). Using historical smallpox data, Keckler et al. (9) and Henderson et al.
(71) conclude that a 3-4 day interval suffices for significant post-exposure protection, while a
vaccine administered any time before symptom onset could be advantageous. Expert opinions
culled using the Delphi technique corroborated this, estimating that vaccination is 93%, 90%,
and 80% effective at preventing smallpox within 0-6 hours, 6-24 hours, and 1-3 days of exposure
respectively, and 80%, 80%, and 75% effective at modifying disease among those who develop
illness (3). A Cochrane Review of varicella vaccines also determined a 3 day window, but could
not locate enough evidence to draw conclusions about vaccine effectiveness beyond 3 days (13).
Another review compared perinatal hepatitis B vaccination to placebo or no intervention found a
relative risk of 0.28 (.20 to 0.40), even with varying immunization schedules (11).
The findings here agree with those previous reviews and indicate that even common
vaccines have properties that have not been fully explored. Of course, post-exposure trials are
especially complicated because they involve a pool of infected individuals. The few studies that
do exist operate in two main ways, largely depending on how easy it is to identify such a sample.
The first approach is to record the time elapsed between vaccination and disease, then infer
exposure timing and the window for effective vaccination based on an incubation period
estimate. This approach allows for less precise knowledge about exposure timing, and thus lends
itself to outbreak situations for diseases like hepatitis A, measles, mumps, varicella, and
smallpox. However, each study reconciles these uncertainties differently, so their designs must
be considered before comparing their results. For instance, reported events can vary in definition:
smallpox onset could refer to either fever (82) or rash (74, 78), which typically develops 2-3 days
after the fever.
The second approach is more straightforward and involves restricting consideration to
exposure occurring in a distinct period of time before vaccine receipt. Examples include outbreak
settings that enforce quarantine (45, 77), or diseases like hepatitis B and rabies where
transmission can be linked to specific events. Rabies is unique in that vaccines are typically
administered after exposure; however, because current guidelines are known to be successful,
deviations larger than the typical 5-day delay have not been studied rigorously (14, 15). Most
documented PEP failures tend not to result from vaccine schedule changes, rather from
insufficient wound infiltration or rabies immunoglobulin dosage (69). Tetanus also spreads by

way of cuts and punctures, although its established treatment protocol has been investigated even
less systematically than rabies. The success of post-exposure vaccination by tetanus toxoid has
ruled out the option of randomized trials, and the success of preventive vaccination has reduced
incidence of tetanus dramatically since the mid-1930s, eliminating most opportunity for case
studies (1).
For both approaches, experimental designs create potential sources of variation across
studies. Studies isolated exposure with varying levels of certainty, and although no significant
pattern emerged between exposure rating and vaccine effectiveness, this rating scale indicates
which of them are most likely capturing the desired effects. Other variables include vaccine
types and doses; sample sizes, which range from 10 or fewer individuals (41, 57, 58, 69) to over
2,000 (51, 81); prior immunity among participants, which all but a few studies monitored (51,
72, 77); and settings, whether in schools, hospitals, prisons, or households. More detailed
information specific to each study can be found in the supplementary documentation.
In addition to these discrepancies, most post-exposure studies assume that post-exposure
vaccination itself does not cause symptoms that could be mistaken for mild versions of the
illness. If erroneous, this could could lead to an underestimation of vaccine effectiveness by
mistaking vaccine-associated rash (for example) for breakthrough infection. One study in healthy
(presumably unexposed) children found that 5.9% of MMRV recipients and 1.9% of
MMRII/VARIVAX recipients experienced a very mild rash following vaccination, although both
groups demonstrated >90% response rates to the vaccine (16); therefore, studies on postexposure vaccination for varicella and measles may conflate minor adverse events with
secondary attacks and underestimate how often the vaccine works. For ethical and logistical
reasons, some reports also lack information about important controls: individuals exposed to and
untreated for rabies, for example, or individuals who receive a post-exposure smallpox
vaccination and are protected from disease. This is the case for all but three historical smallpox
reports (78, 79, 81) while the rest include information only about people presenting with
smallpox, such as the severity and outcome of their disease.
As for the vaccines without evidence of a post-exposure effect, a likely explanation is
that they do not have time to induce an adequate response before clinical disease manifests. The
shortest incubation period among diseases with post-exposure protection is 11-12 days for
measles, while all but four of the 21 diseases without evidence have incubation periods of 10

days or below (Table 1). For diseases that benefit from post-exposure vaccination, a longer
incubation period may permit a longer window for post-exposure vaccination to be effective
(Figure 2). Similar biological considerations already inform treatment guidelines when no trials
are available: for instance, tetanus toxoid is recommended promptly after exposure because too
long a delay would allow additional tetanus neurotoxin to bind to neurons in the peripheral and
central nervous system (17). However, post-exposure vaccination against tetanus produces an
adequate amount of antitoxin in just 4 to 7 days, leaving a small window for a post-exposure
vaccine to outpace the natural, 10-day incubation (1). As discussed previously, the smallpox
vaccine has a similar advantage over the natural infection and begins its course a few days ahead,
spreading directly to regional lymph nodes and lymphoid organs (3). These results indicate that
the success of post-exposure prophylaxis depends upon the timescales of the vaccine as it relates
to disease mechanisms. It is important to note, though, that a post-exposure vaccine could still
supplement other treatments even if it cannot prevent or modify disease alone. Anthrax
infections are one example, and require antibiotics due to a short incubation period and rapid
onset. However, because anthrax spores have been known to survive antibiotic prophylaxis, a
vaccine should also be administered to counter long-lasting threats (1).
An exception to this generalization is the bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine, which
is the only licensed vaccine for tuberculosis and offers no known benefit to individuals with
latent infection, despite the fact that latent (asymptomatic) infection can last for years or decades
(18). Better defense against tuberculosis will ultimately require a new vaccine, and ideally one
that functions both before and after infection. Over a dozen candidates for both priming and
boosting have entered clinical trial to date, six of which are designed for individuals with latent
or active infections – termed post-exposure or therapeutic candidates, respectively (18). The
M72/AS01E vaccine, one of the most promising post-exposure vaccines, recently exhibited
54.0% efficacy among a pool of healthy, M. tuberculosis-infected individuals during a two-year
follow-up (8). This finding, along with a recent BCG-revaccination trial that saw 45% efficacy
within uninfected population (19), has encouraged efforts toward new vaccine strategies for
tuberculosis. Future solutions will have to reimagine how vaccines are implemented along the
disease course, whether that involves a new way of using BCG or a new vaccine altogether.
In addition to these investigative tuberculosis vaccines, several others in the pipeline may
have unexplored post-exposure effects. Filoviruses incubate for a week or longer and thus might

be promising candidates are a likely candidate according to the findings of this review. In case
reports, the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine has appeared to alter the course of Ebolavirus (EBOV)
following several needlestick exposures in humans (20, 21), and controlled studies have found a
50% post-exposure efficacy in nonhuman primates after receiving a lethal challenge (5). Since
disease course is both faster and uniformly lethal in this nonhuman primate model than in
humans, the protective effectiveness of the EBOV vaccine could plausibly surpass 50% in
humans (22). Preliminary research for Marburgvirus (MARV) indicated that the rVSV-MARV
vaccine had similar properties, demonstrating a significant effect if administered within one day
of exposure in rhesus macaques (23). In light of the 2013-2016 EBOV epidemic, filovirus
countermeasures should remain high priority and systematic plans for gathering evidence should
be set in place for the next outbreak.
An intermediate case not considered explicitly in this review is vaccination against herpes
zoster disease. This disease, also called shingles, results from the reactivation of latent varicellazoster virus infection primary, typically symptomatic, varicella disease (chickenpox). Two
vaccines are licensed in the US and have been proven effective in preventing herpes zoster (24,
25). While technically a “post-exposure” effect, we have not included this in the main review
because it is not an effect in preventing primary symptomatic disease, but rather reactivation.
Classic vaccine efficacy trials are designed to study the preventive effectiveness of
vaccination against infection and disease. In most cases, if there were a post-exposure effect of
vaccination, it would have little effect on the outcome of such trials, as a small proportion of trial
participants would be infected at the time of vaccination. Two classes of exceptions are worthy
of note. First is vaccines against bacteria which colonize the respiratory or digestive tract
asymptomatically and for which disease is a comparatively rare complication of colonization.
For vaccines against such bacteria, the limited evidence available is that vaccination does not
terminate the carriage state, but rather reduces the acquisition of carriage and also the probability
of disease given carriage (26). If this is the case, then the post-exposure effect should be modest
for these vaccines and not complicate estimates of effectiveness. On the other hand, a setting
where post-exposure effectiveness could have greater consequences for the interpretation of
vaccine trials is in ring-vaccination trials of vaccines against acute viral diseases, such as the
Ebola ça suffit! trial that evaluated the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine against Ebola virus disease in
Guinea (27). In such a trial, by design vaccination occurs close to the time of likely exposure to

infection, and cases occurring within one incubation period of vaccination (plus one week for
vaccine immunity to ramp up) were excluded from analysis as unpreventable by vaccination. On
one hand, it is possible that post-exposure effects, such as those observed in nonhuman primates
with this vaccine, mean that some cases before that window could be preventable by vaccination,
and it would be interesting to analyze the data from before the window in the main analysis to
see if there is evidence of such an effect. On the other hand, because incubation periods are
variable, it is possible that a window designed to exclude any individuals infected before
vaccination would do so imperfectly, leading to some inclusion of a post-exposure effect in the
main effect estimate. If this design is used again, it would be valuable to quantify the likely
impact of post-exposure effectiveness on estimates obtained from the trial.
With the exception of tuberculosis, most post-exposure benefits discussed so far arise as
side-effects of successful preventative vaccines. However, active therapeutic immunization has
recently become a focus for chronic, mainly non-communicable diseases. Many of these
experimental vaccines induce antibody production, but with the goal of altering a disease that has
already begun. Some treat drug abuse by binding to addictive substances like nicotine and
cocaine (28), and others block tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), an inflammatory cytokine
linked to Crohn’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis (29). Several active therapy
candidates for Alzheimer’s have entered human clinical trials since 2000, mostly to target
amyloid β plaques that are thought to be causative agents (30). However, despite promising
preclinical results, no significant cognitive benefit has been observed to date (31). A similar
narrative characterizes the efforts toward therapeutic HIV-1 vaccines: early optimism because of
a slow and relatively well-understood disease progression, followed by decades of research and
few positive clinical outcomes (32).
Other therapeutic vaccine candidates induce T cells rather than antibodies, an approach
well-suited to treating cancer. In theory, the paradigm mirrors that of classical viral vaccines in
that tumor-associated antigens are used to activate T cells, which differentiate and proliferate in
order to target the unwanted tumor cells (1). However, despite several promising phase III trials
(33, 34), an objective review of cancer vaccine trials found a response rate of less than 4% (35).
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has only approved one cancer vaccine,
Sipuleucel-T, which targets metastatic prostate cancer and prolongs median survival by 4.1
months (36). Still, the same phase III trial that led to its licensure presented no significant effect

on other important disease factors: time to disease progression, tumor regression, long-term
immunity. Interestingly, a different licensed vaccine may have the ability to eradicate other
malignant tumors, specifically squamous cell carcinomas. In a recent case report, the 9-valent
HPV vaccine (Gardisil-9) resolved all of a woman’s tumors within one year of her first injection
(37). Although the HPV vaccine has already been linked to preventing cervical cancer and
others, its therapeutic properties remain unclear (1).
Therapeutic vaccination represents a promising frontier for disease treatment, but also has
implications for how we consider vaccines as a tool for prevention. As evidenced by this report,
post-exposure effectiveness has not been fully explored even for common vaccines, and there are
several scenarios in which they are important: responding to unpredictable health emergencies,
designing new treatments, and interpreting vaccine trials. Especially in outbreak settings,
attributing all outcomes to preventative effects could lead to an overestimation of a vaccine’s
preventive effectiveness, and under-appreciation of its post-exposure effectiveness. Therefore,
post-exposure effects not only concern innovative treatments for exposed or infected individuals,
but could also improve how we anticipate and understand the impact of any vaccine. This review
represents the current body of evidence for vaccines that are already available, and indicates that
there is still much to learn about post-exposure vaccination.

Figure 2: This plot illustrates the post-exposure effect for all eligible vaccines with evidence. The
horizontal axis shows the incubation distribution according to the CDC, while the vertical axis
shows the maximum delay between exposure and vaccination with at least a 75% effectiveness
according to ≥3 studies (at that delay or longer). This effectiveness concerns secondary attack
rate for all vaccines except rabies and smallpox, which use fatality as the measured outcome.
For example: hepatitis A has an incubation period of 15-50 days with an average of 28, and
vaccination is effective anywhere within 0-14 days of exposure according to this review. The two
variables have an insignificant correlation (ρ=.76, p=.08).

Table 1: All infections with an FDA-licensed vaccine, plus dengue, hepatitis E, malaria, and tick
borne encephalitis, which have vaccines available in areas outside the U.S. (organized by
minimum length of incubation period according to CDC.) The interval listed in the third column
is the longest delay with at least 3 studies suggesting an effectiveness of >75%. Diseases with
evidence from this study are highlighted in green; studies with no evidence say ‘no data.’

Table 2: Summary of reports meeting inclusion criteria. Additional notes are listed at the bottom of the table to explain abbreviations.
Exposure rating:
1. Exposure is uncertain or ongoing without a close record of timing or timing is followed but without a control group
2. Study indicates a known point of exposure but offers no explanation for their approach
3. Point of exposure can be extrapolated because timing has been followed closely and/or it is likely but not explicitly stated that index
patients were isolated
4. There is a clear point where exposure occurs, falling before vaccination
