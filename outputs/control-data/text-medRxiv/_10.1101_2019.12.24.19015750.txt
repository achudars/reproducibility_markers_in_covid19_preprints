Abstract

54
55

Background

56

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is common and strongly associated with the

57

metabolic syndrome. Though NAFLD may progress to end-stage liver disease, the top

58

cause of mortality in NAFLD is cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most of the data on liver-

59

related mortality in NAFLD derives from specialist liver centres. We aimed to assess

60

mortality in NAFLD when adjusting for CVD in a ‘real world’ cohort of inpatients.

61
62

Methods

63

Retrospective study of hospitalised patients with 14-years follow-up. NAFL (non-alcoholic

64

fatty liver), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and NAFLD-cirrhosis groups were defined

65

by ICD-10 codes using ACALM methodology. Cases were age-/sex-matched 1:10 with non-

66

NAFLD hospitalised patients from the ACALM registry. All-cause mortality was compared

67

between groups using cox regression adjusted for CVD and metabolic syndrome risk

68

factors.

69
70

Results

71

We identified 1238 patients with NAFL, 105 with NASH and 1235 with NAFLD-cirrhosis.

72

There was an increasing burden of cardiovascular disease with progression from NAFL to

73

NASH to cirrhosis. After adjustment for demographics, metabolic syndrome components

74

and cardiovascular disease, patients with NAFL, NASH, and cirrhosis all had increased all-

75

cause mortality (HR 1.3 (CI 1.1-1.5), HR 1.5 (CI 1.0-2.3) and HR 3.5 (CI 3.3-3.9),

76

respectively). Hepatic decompensation (NAFL HR 8.0 (CI 6.1-10.4), NASH HR 6.5 (2.7-

77

15.4) and cirrhosis HR 85.8 (CI 72-104)), and hepatocellular carcinoma were increased in

78

all NAFLD groups.

Conclusion

81

There is a high burden of cardiovascular disease in NAFLD-cirrhosis patients. From a large

82

“real-life” non-specialist registry of hospitalized patients, NAFLD patients have increased

83

overall mortality and rate of liver-related complications compared to controls after adjusting

84

for cardiovascular disease.

Introduction

92
93

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is the most common liver disease in Europe[1] and is

94

strongly associated with all features of the metabolic syndrome[2]. The majority of NAFLD

95

patients have simple steatosis (non-alcoholic fatty liver, NAFL) and only a minority with non-

96

alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), with or without fibrosis. However a small, but significant

97

proportion do progress to end-stage liver disease[3].

98
99

NAFLD is thought to be associated with increased all-cause and cardiovascular mortality[4–

100

6]. It has been established that fibrosis is the main predictor of long-term liver-related

101

morbidity in NAFLD[7–9] and that patients with NASH but no fibrosis have a similar outcome

102

to those with NAFL and no fibrosis. However, these studies included biopsy-proven patients

103

in specialist clinics and therefore there is likely significant ascertainment bias in estimating

104

rates of hepatic complications. The natural history of NAFLD and its impact upon clinical

105

services is an important topic that divides expert opinion[10,11].

106
107

Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the commonest cause of mortality in patients with

108

NAFLD[9]. A recent large-scale analysis strongly suggests that this is due to prevalence of

109

classical CVD risk factors such as type 2 diabetes and dyslipidaemia[12]. Insulin resistance

110

is thought to be the primary driver linking all these features of the metabolic syndrome. In

111

response to the positive energy balance of obesity, subcutaneous adipose becomes

112

dysfunctional and there is expansion of visceral white adipocytes, which are less insulin

113

sensitive and have a higher basal rate of lipolysis[13]. Elevated insulin and increased

114

substrate delivery to the liver promotes hepatic steatosis by driving increased de novo

115

lipogenesis without increasing glucose uptake[14]. Cumulatively, this results in a rise in

116

circulating triglycerides, impaired low-density lipoprotein clearance, and higher serum

117

glucose. Hepatic steatosis is also thought to alter the composition of secreted lipoparticles

118

[15].

119
120

A further increasingly important consideration is the burden of cardiovascular co-morbidity

121

in patients with end-stage NAFLD for whom transplantation is an option[16]. There is

122

currently limited data on the prevalence of CVD in patients with NAFLD cirrhosis[17]. CVD

123

events are common post-transplant sequelae and chronic kidney disease is linked to

124

reduced graft survival[18].

125
126

Whilst several previous natural history studies have included comparison to age- and

127

gender-matched control populations, they have been unable to control for CVD[19–21].

128

Therefore, it remains unclear whether NAFLD is associated with increased all-cause

129

mortality after correction for cardiac and metabolic disease risk factors.

130
131

We aimed to first describe the burden of cardiovascular disease across the NAFLD disease

132

spectrum: non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL, or simple steatosis), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis

133

(NASH, steatosis plus histological inflammation), and NAFLD-cirrhosis (end-stage fibrosis)

134

and whether NAFL and NASH are associated with increased all-cause mortality in a real life

135

cohort of hospitalised UK patients from the ACALM registry, after correction for CVD and

136

metabolic risk factors.

Materials and Methods

140
141

The study was conducted as a retrospective cohort study of adult patients in England during

142

2000-2013 who were admitted to 7 different hospitals with naturalistic follow-up. All available

143

data was included. Tracing of anonymised patients was performed using the ACALM

144

(Algorithm for Comorbidities, Associations, Length of stay and Mortality) study protocol to

145

develop the ACALM registry and has been previously described by our group[22–27].

146

Briefly, medical records were obtained from local health authority computerized Hospital

147

Activity Analysis register, which is routinely collected by all NHS hospitals. This provides

148

fully anonymized data on hospital admissions and allows for the long-term tracing of patients

149

at an individual hospital. The ACALM protocol uses using International Classification of

150

Disease, 10th edition (ICD-10) and Office of Population Censuses and Surveys Classification

151

of Interventions and Procedures (OPCS-4) coding systems to trace patients. This data was

152

obtained separately for the seven included hospitals. Similar data could be obtained through

153

national Hospital Episode Statistics or from any local Hospital Activity Analysis register.

154
155

ICD-10 codes were used to identify patients with NAFL (non-alcoholic fatty liver, K76.0),

156

NASH (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, K75.8), and NAFLD-cirrhosis (cryptogenic cirrhosis,

157

K74.6). Patients with a history of alcohol excess (F10) were excluded. Where a patient was

158

coded with both NAFL and NASH, they were included in the NASH group. Patients coded

159

with both NAFL and NAFLD-cirrhosis, or NASH and NAFLD-cirrhosis, were included in the

160

cirrhosis group. As per UK practice, the diagnosis of NAFL, NASH, or NAFLD-cirrhosis were

161

made according to clinical judgement and the latest guidelines but the results of the

162

investigations used to derive the diagnoses were not available. An age- and sex-matched

163

control group (with no liver-related diagnoses) was identified from the same ACALM registry

164

and matched 10:1 to patients with NAFLD diagnoses.

165
166

All of these patients were then assessed for the presence of several cardiovascular co-

167

morbidities and risk factors, including: congestive heart failure (CHF, I150.0), atrial fibrillation

168

(I48), and non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM, E11), chronic kidney disease

169

(N18), obesity (E66.0), myocardial infarction (I21-I22), ischaemic heart disease (I20-25),

170

ischaemic stroke (I63.9), hyperlipidaemia (E78.5), hypertension (I10), and peripheral

171

vascular disease (I73.9). Patients were also assessed for liver-related events: hepatocellular

172

carcinoma (C22.9), hepatic failure (K72), oesophageal varices (I85), portal hypertension

173

(K76.6), splenomegaly (R16.1), and ascites (R18). A combined ‘hepatic decompensation or

174

failure’ score was generated from the sum of all non-malignant liver-related events. Inclusion

175

of hepatic encephalopathy (K72.9) or variceal bleeding (I98.3, I98.8, I85.9) did not identify

176

any additional patients. Jaundice was not included due to identification of patients with

177

obstructive (non-hepatic) jaundice.

178
179

Vital status (alive or deceased) on 31st March 2013 was determined by record linkage to the

180

National Health Tracing Services (NHS strategic tracing service) and was received along

181

with the raw data; this was used to calculate all-cause mortality and survival.

182
183

The first admission to hospital treatment was chosen as index admission, follow-up of

184

patients continued until 31st March 2013. Confidentiality of information was maintained in

185

accordance with the UK Data Protection Act. The patient data included was fully anonymous

186

and non-identifiable when received by the authors, and collected routinely by the hospitals.

187

Therefore, according to local research ethics policies we were not required to seek formal

188

ethical approval for this study.

Unadjusted 14-year all-cause mortality was 14.9% for patients in the control group, 14.1%

255

for patients with NAFL, 21.9% for patients with NASH and 53.8% for those with NAFLD-

256

cirrhosis (Fig 1). After adjustment for age, gender and ethnicity, all-cause mortality hazard

257

ratios (HR) were higher in all NAFLD groups compared to the control group (Table 1). After

258

adjustment for cardiovascular factors all-cause mortality was still elevated compared to the

259

control group: NAFL HR 1.3 (CI 1.1-1.5), NASH HR 1.5 (1.0-2.3) and NAFLD-cirrhosis HR

260

3.5 (CI 3.3-3.9). All cause-mortality was similar between NAFL and NASH groups.

Discussion

274
275

This study provides important non-specialist “real life” data amongst hospitalised patients

276

demonstrating an increased mortality for patients with NAFLD, irrespective of fibrosis, even

277

after adjustment for CVD. The size of the cohort and lack of link to specialist liver centres

278

reduces likelihood of bias. These data will help inform healthcare demand for this cohort of

279

patients, complementing modelling estimates[28,29]. In addition, we have highlighted the

280

burden of cardiovascular disease in patients with NAFLD-cirrhosis, which highlights a

281

particular issue for transplantation. Whilst all participants in our cohort were hospitalised,

282

which may increase their risk of future clinical events, so were the controls, thus the

283

comparisons between groups remain valid.

284
285

The strong association between NAFLD and cardiovascular disease has been well

286

established[30,31]. Relationships have been identified between NAFLD and heart

287

failure[32], atrial fibrillation[33], hypertension[34], stroke[35], chronic kidney disease[36],

288

and coronary artery disease. NAFLD has even been linked to increased mortality in acute

289

heart failure[37]. However strong observational data from a large European meta-analysis

290

suggests that NAFLD is not causal in acceleration of cardiovascular disease[12]. Our data

291

highlights the particularly increased prevalence towards cirrhosis. Indeed, hypertension has

292

recently been highlighted as an independent risk factor for advanced fibrosis in NAFLD. A

293

further consideration is whether heart failure contributes to accelerated fibrosis in

294

NAFLD[38], though causality is difficult to establish.

295
296

Previous studies with biopsy-defined cohorts have been smaller, did not adjust for

297

cardiovascular diagnoses[9,20], and found no difference in mortality between participants

298

with NAFLD and no fibrosis and controls. Kim et al. used NHANES data to stratify patients

299

by non-invasive fibrosis scores, and again found no increase in mortality in patients with

300

ultrasound-defined NAFLD, after correction for diabetes and hypertension[19]. This may be

301

accounted for by differences in the ethnicity of the cohort and also the general, rather than

302

specialist, nature of our population.

303
304

NAFLD may itself be a marker of sub-clinical cardiovascular disease. For example,

305

increased carotid intima media thickness has been found in adolescents with NAFLD[39].

306

This is mechanistically plausible as hepatic steatosis occurs (in part) in response to

307

peripheral insulin resistance and elevated substrate delivery from lipolysis of adipose tissue.

308

Steatosis itself then contributes to systemic insulin resistance[40]. Therefore, in this

309

analysis, despite adjusting for metabolic covariates and cardiovascular risk factors, elevated

310

mortality may reflect the sub-clinical nature of atherosclerosis associated with NAFLD, even

311

at an early stage.

312
313

Given the shared disease mechanisms and clinical outcomes for NAFLD and cardiovascular

314

disease, these data suggest a common framework for treatment. Weight loss is the only

315

established treatment strategy for NAFLD[41] and there is data suggesting that specific

316

dietary regimens (including the Mediterranean diet) are beneficial[42]. The same lifestyle

317

interventions

318

cardiovascular[43,44] and hepatic events.

and aggressive risk factor modification will dual impact on reducing

319
320

Whilst we were not able to determine cause of death or admission in our cohort, we were

321

able to determine that liver decompensation events were increased in all groups relative to

322

the control group.

324

This study is limited by its retrospective design and the use of generic coding, which did not

325

provide information on how the diagnosis was obtained i.e. imaging, liver function tests, or

326

liver biopsy and we were unable to identify whether NAFLD was the cause of admission or

327

an existing co-morbidity in cases. Therefore, differences between the NAFL and NASH

328

groups should be interpreted with this in mind. However, coding improvements in recent

329

years along with standardised diagnosis of NAFLD in the UK means that the impact of

330

inaccurate coding is likely to be low. Published studies suggest that only 2-10%[1] of the

331

NAFLD groups may be affected and thus have minimal impact on the results observed in

332

this study. The use of ICD-10 codes for the exclusion of other causes of liver dysfunction

333

(for example, viral hepatitis) and patients with a history of alcohol consumption may have

334

also contributed to inaccurate coding. However, such biases have been limited from our

335

previous study looking at the association between cardiovascular and respiratory conditions

336

[30]. There is likely to be a degree of under coding of NAFLD, especially as clinical

337

awareness of NAFLD was not optimal at the beginning of the data capture[47].

338
339

In conclusion, these results contribute to our understanding of co-morbidity, mortality and

340

liver decompensation in patients with NAFLD spectrum disease and demonstrate that the

341

increase in mortality occurs independently of known cardiovascular risk factors.
