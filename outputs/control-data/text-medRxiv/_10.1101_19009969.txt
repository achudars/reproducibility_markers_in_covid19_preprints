Abstract
Purpose: Predictive diagnostics play an increasingly important role in personalized
medicine for cancer treatment. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) based treatment
selection is expected to rapidly increase worldwide. Detailed and comparative cost
analyses of diagnostic techniques are an essential element in decision-making. This
study aimed to calculate and compare the total cost of currently used diagnostic
techniques and of WGS in treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC),
melanoma, colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in the
Netherlands.
Methods: The activity-based costing (ABC) method was conducted to calculate the
total cost of included diagnostic techniques based on data provided by Dutch
pathology laboratories and the Dutch centralized cancer WGS facility. Costs were
allocated to four categories: capital costs, maintenance costs, software costs and
operational costs. Outcome measures were total cost per cancer patient per included
technique, and the total cost per cancer patient per most commonly applied
technique (combination) for each cancer type.
Results: The total cost per cancer patient per technique varied from € 58 (Sanger
sequencing, 3 amplicons) to € 4738 (paired tumor-normal WGS). The operational
costs accounted for the vast majority over 90 % of the total per cancer patient
technique costs. The most important operational cost drivers were consumables
followed by personnel (for sample preparation and primary data analysis).
Conclusion: This study outlined in detail all costing aspects and cost prices of
current and new diagnostic modalities used in treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, CRC
and GIST in the Netherlands. Detailed cost differences and value comparisons
between these diagnostic techniques enable future economic evaluations to support

Introduction
Newly developed medicines (targeted therapies and immunotherapies) play an
increasingly important role in treatment of cancer (1–2). However, only subgroups of
patients respond to these (mostly expensive) treatments (3–6). Patients who do not
respond can experience serious side effects. Matching each patient to the
appropriate therapy is complex and as a consequence, not all patients receive the
treatment they could have benefitted from (3–5). This calls for a better patient
selection, improvement of personalized treatment and thereby expectantly improving
the patients’ life expectancy, experienced quality of life and reducing health care
costs. Optimal predictive diagnostics in molecular pathology are necessary to
determine which therapy is most appropriate for a patient (7–10).

In predictive diagnostics of somatic molecular analyses in pathology, various
techniques can be used to depict genetic characteristics of a tumor. Single-gene
analysis or sequencing of targeted gene panels (TGP) using next generation
sequencing (NGS) techniques, or a combination of the two, are routine practice in the
diagnostics trajectory for different cancer types (11). In current clinical practice, there
is large variation in both the frequency and type of technique used for the selection of
cancer treatment (12). In comparison, the advanced diagnostic technique of whole
genome sequencing (WGS) is currently only applied in research context in oncology.

The main advantage of WGS, in contrast to TGP, is that it is able to detect all types
of DNA alterations (i.e. mutations, copy number alterations, structural variants, tumor
mutational burden and DNA repair status) of the tumor (13–14). It increases the
chance of optimal treatment selection, and determines eligibility of patients for clinical

trials as many study inclusion markers are not included in standard diagnostic gene
panels. From a technical point of view, WGS could therefore replace a multitude of
currently used diagnostic techniques, but it comes at a higher cost. Recent costing
studies have indicated that costs range from € 265 to € 309 for single-gene
techniques (12), from € 376 to € 968 for small TGPs (5–50 gene panels (15–16), ~
50 gene panels (12)), and from € 333 to € 1948 for larger TGPs (> 50 gene panels
(15), 90 gene panels (17)) in 2014–2015. The cost of WGS per cancer patient (paired
tumor-normal) was estimated at € 6676 (17) and at € 5645 (18) in 2015–2016, at $
4484 (about € 3870) in 2017 (19), and at £ 6841 (about € 7501) in 2019 (20) (€ 1669,
€ 1411, $ 1121, £ 3420 per genome equivalent, respectively).

These studies performed micro-costing analyses. Some studies specifically made
use of the activity-based costing (ABC) method, a process-based cost allocation
technique (21). Nevertheless, results are difficult to compare, as included cost
components differed among all studies as well as the interpretation of process steps,
and, as such, the incorporated related costs. Cost drivers are anticipated to be
platform utilization (12, 18) and consumables (14, 15–18).

The implementation and use of WGS is expected to rapidly increase worldwide in the
coming years (13–14). A variety of reasons underlie this prospect. Namely, the
increasing availability of targeted drugs (1–2), and the increased registration of pancancer drugs (22), leading to an increase in needed tests and accumulation of
sequential tests. Therefore, it is essential to determine both costs and effects of
WGS-based treatment selection versus current practice in an economic evaluation.
Such evaluations encompass complete overviews of all costs and effects involved in

a specific disease area, from diagnostics to treatment and hospitalization. Detailed
and comparative cost estimations of diagnostic techniques are required. These are
important in assessing the added value (in monetary terms) of new diagnostic
modalities, and in providing insight when to replace standard diagnostic techniques
with these new modalities.

To the best of our knowledge, no previous research investigated the costs of
currently used diagnostic techniques and WGS in the context of predictive testing in
cancer treatment selection using a consistent and uniform costing method.
Therefore, we performed a micro-costing study using similar process-based cost
calculations of the different diagnostic techniques application across Dutch pathology
laboratories (hereinafter referred to as labs) and WGS used in a central lab. We
aimed to calculate and compare the total cost of currently used diagnostic techniques
and of WGS in treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, colorectal cancer (CRC) and
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) in the Netherlands.

Methods
Data availability
The data used for the study were obtained from 24 Dutch labs and the cancer WGS
facility of Hartwig Medical Foundation (HMF) in the year 2018. The predictive
diagnostic techniques included from the participating labs were techniques that are
currently used for treatment selection of advanced NSCLC, melanoma, CRC or
GIST. This led to the inclusion of following techniques: immunohistochemistry (IHC),
Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), pyrosequencing (Pyro seq), High
Resolution Melting (HRM), Sanger sequencing (Sanger), NGS gene panels, Cobas

and Biocartis. In this study, the costs of certain techniques were subdivided regarding
their target genes (Sanger and Biocartis), cancer hotspot panels (NGS) or protein
expression (IHC).

Included techniques were selected based on an inventory at participating labs. These
labs received a questionnaire to obtain information about most frequently used
techniques in treatment of the different cancer types. In addition, the frequency of
technique usage was extracted from the nationwide network and registry of histo-and
cytopathology in the Netherlands (PALGA) (23), which contains the digital pathology
reports of all 46 Dutch pathology laboratories since 1971. The inventory was
performed between 01-10-2017 and 30-09-2018 and was substantiated with
feedback moments to the labs in order to ensure additional validity. Data on
technique frequency usage are available in Supplementary Table 1.

Information about WGS was obtained from the HMF facility, a centralized
independent organization focused on clinical-grade WGS of cancer patients. WGSbased analyses were performed as part of clinical trial studies involving treatment of
all types of cancer patients, so regardless of cancer type.

Micro-costing design
The cost calculations for the different diagnostic techniques used in the Netherlands
were performed using the ABC method (21). For this purpose, a measurement plan
was created including the essential cost components.

The most frequently used techniques in treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, CRC and
GIST were defined by the participating 24 Dutch labs. Per technique, three labs, if
possible, using the specific technique were consulted to determine the costs by filling
out the measurement plan. In an organized meeting, consensus was reached
between the labs concerning these measurement plans. Consensus was not based
on averaging of cost prices of different labs, but rather based on an ‘average’ lab with
realistic samples numbers, accepted protocols and equipment. The measurement
plans were sent back and forth several times for feedback after this meeting.
Additionally, supplier standard list prices were requested and received for
consumables, and for acquisition and maintenance of the platforms. Together, this
led to a cost overview with final cost prices related to the test, data analysis and
reporting process per technique, per cancer type.

With regard to WGS, a measurement plan was completed by the HMF facility, which
corresponded to the one filled out by the labs. The test, data analysis and reporting
process was expressed in a final cost price. The final cost price estimation was
based on utilization in a decentralized setting, or an average Dutch lab practice, and
standard list prices of the supplier for acquisition and maintenance of the platforms
and for consumables.

In sum, a so called standard case perspective was maintained in calculating the base
case cost prices for all techniques for the purpose of realistic cost comparison. This
means that an average lab practice was assumed, and suppliers’ standard list prices
were used, concerning all techniques. The assumptions underlying the cost

calculations are shown in Table 1, which are all based on the standard case
perspective.

Allocation of costs
Costs directly related to the test, data analysis and reporting process were taken into
account. Costs that are associated with obtaining the material (blood and tumor
biopsy withdrawal), DNA extraction in both tumor and blood, and overhead costs
were excluded. Included costs were allocated to four categories: capital costs,
maintenance costs, software costs and operational costs.

Capital costs were fixed costs of the platforms. The life cycle, interest rate and
annuity factor of the various platforms were used in calculating the annual capital
costs per cancer patient. Maintenance costs were annual returning fixed costs for
platform maintenance. No maintenance costs were taken into account for the first
year as the platforms have a warranty for the first year. The annual maintenance
costs were estimated per cancer patient for the other years. Software costs involved
either software acquisition (license) costs or costs incurred for daily supervision and
maintenance of the pipeline, and were calculated per cancer patient. Operational
costs consisted of costs incurred for the process of analysis, such as consumables,
personnel for sample preparation, primary data analysis, interpretation and report,
and data processing and storage. These operational costs were also estimated per
cancer patient. Finally, total cost per cancer patient was calculated by summing up all
the calculated total costs per cost category.

Analyses
Base case analysis
The base case analysis was performed from the earlier defined standard case
perspective based on the assumptions described in Table 1. The primary outcome
measure of interest was the total cost per cancer patient per included technique.

The second outcome measure included the total cost per cancer patient per most
frequently applied technique (combination). Only those techniques used for targeted
therapy stratification based on genomic aberrations were considered (so excluding
IHC testing (programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) protein expression as is included in
Table 1 and 2). The total cost per technique was calculated for each cancer type
separately with a maximum of three different technique combinations ordered by
technique frequency usage. WGS was included as a sole potential future practice for
all cancer types for which combinations with other techniques were redundant.

For standard techniques to be included, the following condition had to be met: the
technique should be performed in ≥ 2 labs (inventory labs) and included ≥ 5 % of the
analyses in total for the respective cancer types (PALGA data; Supplementary Table
1). This led to the inclusion of NGS gene panels, Sanger, HRM, IHC and FISH.
These techniques covered at least 80 % of the performed analyses per cancer type
(Supplementary Table 1). In addition, WGS was included based on application at the
HMF facility only.

In order to obtain a representation of the variation in technique usage and associated
process costs, across all 24 labs, the distribution of costs were mapped around the
average. Moreover, as the HMF facility is currently one of few WGS testing suppliers
in the Netherlands, their actual practice was taken into account as a sensitivity
analysis. Finally, two anticipated cost drivers were selected for this sensitivity
analysis: utilization of the platforms and the cost of consumables, based on previous
research (12, 14, 15–18). The extent of variation of these parameters were based on
lab- and HMF-specific practices in the year 2018.

For the sensitivity analyses, only techniques included in the base case analysis
concerning the second outcome measure were taken into account. A margin of + 15
% and – 15 % around the calculated average platform utilization for the standard
techniques applied by different included labs was deemed to be a realistic variation.
Therefore, utilization of the platforms varied from 17 to 47 % for NGS gene panels
(average 32 %), 39 to 69 % for Sanger (average 54 %), 13 to 43 % for HRM
(average 28 %), 15 to 45 % for IHC (average 30 %) and 9 to 39 % for FISH (average
24 %). For WGS, the average platform utilization was varied to the actual practice
use by + 30 %: from 60 % to 90 %. The cost of consumables was reduced in the
sensitivity analysis by 30 % for all the techniques, which was based on the
reasonable expectation of discounts from the suppliers.

Results
The assumptions underlying the cost calculations for the application of the included
diagnostic techniques are depicted in Table 1. The Table shows all values of the

various factors based on the standard case perspective as outlined for both standard
diagnostics and WGS below.

Standard diagnostics
For each of the included standard diagnostic techniques one tumor sample is
needed, corresponding to the test of one cancer patient. The number of samples that
can be analyzed per run and the sequencing depth were based on the concerning
supplier specifications. Furthermore, suppliers’ standard list prices were used as cost
of acquisition and maintenance of the platforms, and as cost of consumables.
Utilization of the sequencing platform, personnel time needed for sample preparation,
primary data analysis, data interpretation and report, are all based on the standard
practice of an average lab using the technique. Gross hourly salaries of the
laboratory technician, bioinformatics technician, clinical molecular biologist, and
pathologist were based on Dutch hospital collective employment agreement 2018
costs.

WGS
The calculations for WGS are based on the sequencing platform NovaSeq 6000 from
Illumina, which is used in the HMF facility. Furthermore, a liquid handler is included
for sample preparation. Per cancer patient two samples are needed for the sequence
analysis: one tumor and one reference (blood) sample, which allows the necessary
tumor to normal comparison. The sequencing unit for WGS is a sequencing depth of
30x coverage. In applying WGS, two sample preparations and four sequencing units
are needed. The four sequencing units include three times 30x coverage of the tumor
(to compensate for tumor purity heterogeneity) and one time 30x coverage of the

reference sample. Acquisition and maintenance costs of the platforms are based on
utilization of the technique in an average Dutch lab practice. The costs of
consumables are based on Illumina’s standard list prices, not taking into account
discounts. In line with the standard case perspective, the number of samples per run
and runs per year are 24 and 208, respectively, with a 60 % utilization of the
sequencing platform. Furthermore, personnel time needed for sample preparation,
primary data analysis, data interpretation and report, are all based on standard
practice of an average lab. Data processing and data storage are outsourced and
concerns processing and storage of BAM files, VCF files and patient reports. Gross
hourly salaries of the laboratory technician, clinical molecular biologist, and
bioinformatics technician were based on the HMF facility employers’ 2018 costs.

Concerning all techniques, costs of acquisition and maintenance of the platforms,
any software acquisition (license), and used consumables exclude Value Added
Taxes (VAT) (Dutch standard rate is 21 %). Utilization percentages are defined
based on 100 % utilization, indicating that the platforms run samples 8 hours a day
and 5 days per week (average working week). All costs are reported in 2018 euros.

58 (Sanger, 3 amplicons) to € 4738 (paired tumor-normal WGS). For most
techniques, total per cancer patient costs (including any target gene, hotspot panel or
protein expression subdivisions) were over 90 % attributable to operational costs.
Within this cost category, the most important cost drivers were consumables (for
most > 50 % of operational cost) followed by personnel for sample preparation and
primary data analysis.

Base case analysis: Secondary outcome
Table 3 depicts a cost overview of most frequently occurring technique
(combinations), including only those techniques used for targeted therapy
stratification based on genomic aberrations, focusing on NSCLC, melanoma, CRC
and GIST. The WGS technique would be a potential future (combinational) indication
of practice use with a year 2018 total cost per cancer patient of € 4738. For WGS no
additional IHC or FISH for detection of fusion genes (e.g. EML4-ALK) is necessary as
is required for NGS gene panels. However, for immunotherapy, sequencing
techniques like NGS and WGS would have to be applied in combination with IHC
protein expression (PD-L1) testing of the tumor, which is not included in Table 3. For
the specific cancer types, the total cost per cancer patient varied between € 58
(Sanger) and € 284 (NGS) for melanoma, € 63 (Sanger) and € 284 (NGS) for CRC, €
69 (Sanger) and € 284 (NGS) for GIST, and technique combinations for NSCLC
ranged from € 313 (Sanger and FISH) to € 526 (NGS and FISH).

Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses demonstrate the impact on the total cost per cancer patient
of varying platform utilization (+ / – 15 % standard techniques; + 30 % WGS) and
reducing consumable cost by 30 %. In Table 4 the base case total cost, and the
range resulting from varying platform utilization and reducing consumable cost, are
shown per frequently occurring technique as included in Table 3. In any case, the
ranges show overall cost reductions: to illustrate, from € 284 (average 32 % platform
utilization) to € 250 (17 % platform utilization; – 30 % consumable cost) and € 216
(47 % platform utilization; – 30 % consumable cost) for NGS gene panels; from € 204
(average 30 % platform utilization) to € 166 (15 % platform utilization; – 30 %
consumable cost) and € 161 (45 % platform utilization; – 30 % consumable cost) for
IHC (ALK, ROS1); from € 4738 (average 60 % platform utilization) to € 3403 (90 %
platform utilization; – 30 % consumable cost) for WGS. However, varying platform
utilization has little impact compared to reducing consumable cost, which seems to
have a large impact.

This micro-costing study provides detailed and comparable up to date costs of
currently used diagnostic techniques and WGS in the context of predictive analysis
for four cancer types. The total cost per cancer patient per technique varied

considerably. For the vast majority of techniques, the operational costs (process of
analysis costs such as consumables and personnel) accounted for over 90 % of the
total per cancer patient technique costs (including any target gene, hotspot panel or
protein expression subdivisions).

Strengths of the study are that the interpretation of each included cost item per cost
category in the measurement plan was aligned extensively for all included techniques
with those parties involved. Furthermore, a consistent and uniform method was used
in performing process-based cost calculations of the application of the different
techniques. Finally, these cost outcomes can be used for (comparative) value
assessments on current and new diagnostic techniques.

In sensitivity analyses, the input parameters were changed (utilization platform
percentage and cost of consumables). A large decrease in costs can be achieved
when costs for consumables might be lower in the future. Even when platform
utilization was reduced, the final total cost was lower for all techniques compared to
the calculated standard case perspective cost. This shows that the cost component
consumables is a more important cost driver than platform utilization.

Comparing our cost outcomes with those initially presented in the literature indicate
that our costs for standard techniques are relatively lower. Roughly estimated, the
extent of reduction was 18 % for single-gene techniques (€ 265 – € 309 (12) versus
on average € 65 – € 405 (Sanger, HRM, IHC, FISH, Biocartis, Cobas, Pyro seq
calculations)) and 58 % for small TGPs of 5 to (~) 50 gene panels (€ 376 – € 968 (12,
15–16) versus on average € 284 (NGS gene panels calculations)). An explanation for

the differences in costs is most probably the different costing methods used and
reference year. Our calculated price for WGS (€ 4738) is higher compared to the
price by Wetterstrand ($ 4484 (about € 3870)) (19). Unfortunately, due to a lack of
insight in pricing characteristics of previous calculations, we are not able to indicate
reasons for this difference. Total cost for all DNA sequencing techniques including
WGS is likely to decrease as a result of continuously ongoing innovations and due to
market forces, leading to a reduced price of consumables over time, which is the
main cost driver (17–18).

It should be stressed that total costs presented per technique are directly related to
the test, data analysis and reporting process, so the final cost price indicated in this
analysis is not the cost of what a technique costs in its entirety (exclusion of cost
obtaining biopsy material, DNA extraction, VAT and overhead). Other excluded costs
are, for example, time spend on training, validation, quality assurance and innovation
costs (16). Noteworthy, novel genetic biomarkers are continuously emerging.
However, these costs of development and implementation of new techniques, or
adaptation and validation of existing techniques, are also excluded. Understandably,
total cost of techniques is higher when focusing on the entire trajectory. Nonetheless,
these outcomes are a snapshot in time, that is, all necessities (platforms,
consumables) are strongly in development, especially for DNA sequencing
techniques, and are likely to decrease in cost price (17–19). If so, this can easily be
changed in our cost tables to calculate new cost prices.

Other factors that should be taken into account when comparing current standard
diagnostic techniques and WGS are turnaround time, sensitivity, specificity,

diagnostic yield and quality of the sequencing results. Among other things, the
frequency of testing (e.g. number of sequencing runs per week or multiple,
sequential, testing), the turnaround time of a sequencing run, time for data analysis
and interpretation of results effects the total turnaround time of a sample. The
success rate of the sequencing analysis depends on the quantity and quality (biopsy
size, tumor volume) of the tumor material, and the amount and quality of DNA
extracted (24–25). Subsequently, it determines the number of biopsies to be
collected (new material needed when it turns out not to be of sufficient quantity or
quality). Rationally, the latter in turn has an impact on waiting time till the start of
treatment.

Some limitations of the study need to be addressed. First, this study made an
attempt to define realistic assumptions that define the likely cost of application of
these techniques in an average lab practice in the Netherlands. Second, for the
Dutch labs, the base case assumptions came forth based on a maximum of three
labs per included technique, so not all 24 individual labs that helped in defining the
most frequently used techniques. As for the HMF facility, the base case assumptions
on WGS testing, assuming an average Dutch lab practice, were verified with inhouse experts. Lastly, no data could be obtained for MassArray, which was initially
identified as a frequently used technique in treatment of NSCLC and CRC (by one
lab), and was therefore not included.

Conclusion
This study provided a detailed overview of all costing aspects and cost prices of
current and new diagnostic techniques in treatment of NSCLC, melanoma, CRC and

GIST in the Netherlands. Costs varied between € 58 (Sanger, 3 amplicons) to € 4738
(paired tumor-normal WGS). Costs for commonly used techniques per cancer type
varied between € 58 (Sanger) and € 284 (NGS) for melanoma, € 63 (Sanger) and €
284 (NGS) for CRC, € 69 (Sanger) and € 284 (NGS) for GIST, and technique
combinations for NSCLC ranged from € 313 (Sanger and FISH) to € 526 (NGS and
FISH). The cost of WGS is significantly higher compared to the cost of standard
techniques, but it is expected to decrease over time. In terms of value, diagnostic
yield is potentially larger with WGS. Though, the study exclusively compared the
different techniques based on cost price and not based on their potential value.

Differences in value were not collected in this study, therefore this study can and
should be used as starting point in comparing diagnostic modalities. Important to
note is that additional factors with regard to value ought to be included to fully assess
added benefits (both on monetary as well clinical aspects) of new diagnostic
techniques. Future economic evaluations of diagnostic modalities should take into
account this difference in value together with the detail costing to give a more
comprehensive meaning to the comparison of diagnostic techniques used in cancer
treatment. These evaluations support decision-making on implementation of WGS
and other diagnostic modalities in routine clinical practice.

In-house

 The standard case perspective implies that an average Dutch lab practice was assumed and suppliers’ standard list prices were used, in respect of all techniques.
 Additional equipment refers to sample preparation platforms for NGS gene panels and WGS, whereby the unit of sample preparation is sample.
 The average coverage (sequencing depth) is based on the standard techniques' specifications of the relevant suppliers. The 120x coverage for WGS corresponds to 2 samples (also 1 cancer patient) and consists of
90x tumor coverage (3 times for heterogeneity) and 30x blood coverage (1 time as a reference genome).
 The unit of 1 flow cell is 30x coverage. In 1 run 2 flow cells of each 30x coverage fit. So, in 2 runs 4 flow cells fit, which corresponds to the 120x coverage for WGS.
 Data processing and data storage are outsourced for WGS.
 Data storage time concerns 6 months of hot storage of a BAM file, VCF file and patient report for WGS.
 The sample preparation and primary data analysis is done by a laboratory and bioinformatics technician for the standard techniques, and by a laboratory technician only for WGS. Sample and report administration
is incorporated for all techniques.
 The data interpretation and report is done by a clinical molecular geneticist and pathologist for the standard techniques, and by a clinical molecular geneticist and a bioinformatics technician for WGS.
 In-house refers to in-house pipeline experience, for example, Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA), Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), Strelka, BLCtoFASTQ, sebamba, PURPLE for WGS.
 Including immunohistochemistry (IHC), Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), pyrosequencing (Pyro seq), High Resolution Melting (HRM), Sanger sequencing (Sanger), next generation sequencing (NGS) and

 The standard case perspective implies that an average Dutch lab practice was assumed and suppliers’ standard list prices were used, in respect of all techniques.
 The cost of the platforms, software and consumables all exclude Value Added Taxes (VAT).
 For the standard diagnostic techniques, life cycles varying between 5 to 10 years, annuity factors ranging between 4.39 to 7.91, and an interest rate of 4.5 % are maintained for both types of equipment (if
applicable). The annual capital costs of the additional equipment (sample preparation platform) and the sequencing platform for WGS are calculated by taking into account a life cycle of 5 years, an annuity factor of
4.45 and an interest rate of 4 %.
 The capital, maintenance and operational costs per sample calculations are based on 2 times sample preparation and 4 times genome sequencing (90x coverage tumor and 30x coverage blood) for WGS. For WGS
application, two samples are needed (tumor biopsy and blood) to do the analysis whereas for the standard used techniques 1 sample (tumor) suffices.
 During the first year no maintenance costs occur as the platforms have a warranty for the first year.
 Software management / maintenance incorporates daily supervision and maintenance of the pipeline for WGS. It takes up 0.2 FTE (of a 40-hour working week) for a bioinformatics technician with a gross hourly
salary of € 50.

 Data processing and data storage are outsourced for WGS. The cost of data processing covers the complete analysis of raw data to BAM file, VCF file and patient report. The cost of data storage is estimated based
on hot storage of the BAM file, VCF file and patient report for 6 months (€ 4 per month per 200 GB).
 The sample preparation and primary data analysis is done by a laboratory technician (gross hourly salary of € 22) and bioinformatics technician (gross hourly salary of € 29) for the standard techniques. For WGS this
is performed by a laboratory technician (gross hourly salary of €25). Sample and report administration is incorporated for all techniques.
 The data interpretation and report per sample is done by a clinical molecular biologist (gross hourly salary of € 41) and pathologist (gross hourly salary of € 61) for the standard techniques. For WGS this is
performed by a clinical molecular biologist and a bioinformatics technician, both with a gross hourly salary of €50.
 The total cost per cancer patient represents a total cost per target gene separately for IHC (ALK or ROS1) and FISH (ALK, ROS1 or RET). A combined total cost per cancer patient of the specified target genes per
technique is given for Pyro seq, HRM (EGFR + KRAS + BRAF; BRAF + NRAS) and Biocartis (BRAF + NRAS), and for Sanger (10, 3, 6, 9 amplicons) and NGS hotspot panels.
 Including immunohistochemistry (IHC), Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), pyrosequencing (Pyro seq), High Resolution Melting (HRM), Sanger sequencing (Sanger), next generation sequencing (NGS) and
whole genome sequencing (WGS).

 Overall, included standard techniques were performed in ≥ 2 labs (inventory labs) and included ≥ 5 % of the analyses in total for the respective cancer types (PALGA data) (Supplementary Table 1). These
techniques covered at least 80 % of the performed analyses per cancer type (PALGA data). WGS usage is a potential future practice expectation for all cancer types. The total cost per technique represents a
combined total cost, which is calculated based on their analysis of target genes (IHC, FISH, HRM) or hotspot panels (Sanger, NGS). For NGS, an average of the total cost of the three different platforms was used for
the calculations.
 Test 1, 2 (and 3) show the descending order of frequency usage of technique (combinations).
 For NSCLC, the techniques included in test 1 are concomitantly applied (100 %) and those incorporated in test algorithm 2 and 3 are sequential applied (< 100 %), only when the prior test is negative.
 The total cost for FISH is based on 60 % frequency usage of ALK, ROS1 and RET (sequential testing: in 40 % of cases a mutation in EGFR or KRAS is observed, and consequently FISH is not performed) (26-27).
 The genes tested with Sanger are EGFR, KRAS, BRAF, ERBB2 and MET (10 amplicons) for NSCLC; BRAF and NRAS (3 amplicons) for melanoma; KRAS, NRAS and BRAF (6 amplicons) for CRC; KIT, PDGFRA and BRAF (9
amplicons) for GIST.
 Including non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), colorectal cancer (CRC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

 Currently most frequently used techniques in cancer types of focus.
 The average total cost of the cost calculation outcomes for the NGS platforms and different hotspot panels is used.
 The utilization of the platforms varied from 17 to 47 % for NGS (average 32 %), 39 to 69 % for Sanger (average 54 %), 13 to 43 % for HRM (average 28 %), 15 to 45 % for IHC (average 30 %), 9 to 39 % for FISH
(average 24 %) and 60 % to 90 % for WGS. The cost of consumables were reduced by 30 % for all the techniques.

 Online only.
 The standard case perspective implies that an average Dutch lab practice was assumed and suppliers’ standard list prices were used, in respect of all techniques.
 The cost of the platforms, software and consumables all exclude Value Added Taxes (VAT).
 For the standard diagnostic techniques, life cycles varying between 5 to 10 years, annuity factors ranging between 4.39 to 7.91, and an interest rate of 4.5 % are maintained for both types of equipment (if
applicable). The annual capital costs of the additional equipment (sample preparation platform) and the sequencing platform for WGS are calculated by taking into account a life cycle of 5 years, an annuity factor of
4.45 and an interest rate of 4 %.
 The capital, maintenance and operational costs per sample calculations are based on 2 times sample preparation and 4 times genome sequencing (90x coverage tumor and 30x coverage blood) for WGS. For WGS
application, two samples are needed (tumor biopsy and blood) to do the analysis whereas for the standard used techniques 1 sample (tumor) suffices.
 During the first year no maintenance costs occur as the platforms have a warranty for the first year.
 Software management / maintenance incorporates daily supervision and maintenance of the pipeline for WGS. It takes up 0.2 FTE (of a 40-hour working week) for a bioinformatics technician with a gross hourly
salary of € 50.
 Data processing and data storage are outsourced for WGS. The cost of data processing covers the complete analysis of raw data to BAM file, VCF file and patient report. The cost of data storage is estimated based
on hot storage of the BAM file, VCF file and patient report for 6 months (€ 4 per month per 200 GB).
 The sample preparation and primary data analysis is done by a laboratory technician (gross hourly salary of € 22) and bioinformatics technician (gross hourly salary of € 29) for the standard techniques. For WGS this
is performed by a laboratory technician (gross hourly salary of €25). Sample and report administration is incorporated for all techniques.
 The data interpretation and report per sample is done by a clinical molecular biologist (gross hourly salary of € 41) and pathologist (gross hourly salary of € 61) for the standard techniques. For WGS this is
performed by a clinical molecular biologist and a bioinformatics technician, both with a gross hourly salary of €50.
 The total cost per cancer patient represents a total cost per target gene separately for IHC (ALK or ROS1) and FISH (ALK, ROS1 or RET). A combined total cost per cancer patient of the specified target genes per
technique is given for Pyro seq, HRM (EGFR + KRAS + BRAF; BRAF + NRAS) and Biocartis (BRAF + NRAS), and for Sanger (10, 3, 6, 9 amplicons) and NGS hotspot panels.
 Including immunohistochemistry (IHC), Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH), pyrosequencing (Pyro seq), High Resolution Melting (HRM), Sanger sequencing (Sanger), next generation sequencing (NGS) and
whole genome sequencing (WGS).
