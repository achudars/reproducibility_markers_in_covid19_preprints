Abstract:
Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an important enzyme involved in folate metabolism, DNA
synthesis and methylation. A number of studies have examined the association of maternal MTHFR A1298C
polymorphism with congenital heart disease (CHD) susceptibility; however, the conclusions were contradictory. To
clarify the influence of maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism on CHD, a meta-analysis of seventeen casecontrol studies was carried out. Four electronic databases - Pubmed, Google Scholars, Elsevier and Springer Link
were searched upto June, 2018 for suitable articles. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals
(95% CIs) were used to evaluate the association. Meta-analysis was performed by Mix and MetaAnalyst programs.
The results of meta-analysis suggested that except co-dominant model, maternal A1298C polymorphism is risk for
CHD in fetus using overall comparisons in four genetic models (C vs. A: OR= 1.19, 95% CI= 1.00-1.41, p= 0.04;
CC+AC vs. AA: OR= 1.19, 95% CI= 0.97-1.4, p= 0.04; CC vs. AA: OR= 1.46, 95% CI= 1.00-2.13, p= 0.04; AC vs.
AA OR= 1.13, 95% CI=0.93-1.36, p= 0.23; CC vs. AC+AA: OR=1.34, 95% CI=1.1-1.6, p=0.01). Publication bias
was absent using four genetic models. In conclusion, results of present meta-analysis showed significant association
between maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and CHD risk.

Introduction:
Cardiac malformations rank among the most common congenital malformations. The incidence of congenital heart
disease (CHD) is about 8 per 1000 live birth (Mitchell et al., 1971; Hofmann and Christianson, 1978; Winter et
al.,2007) and are mainly due to incomplete development of the heart during pregnancy (Bozovic et al., 2011). Their
origin is considered to be multifactorial, resulting from an interaction between genetic predisposition and
environmental factors. Periconceptional folic acid, reduces the risk of CHD like -neural tube defects (NTD) (Czeizel
and Dudas, 1992). Although the mechanism by which folic acid exerts its protective effect is unclear, the teratogenic
process resulting from folate insufficiency may be related to hyperhomocysteinemia (Nelen, 2001; Vollset et al.,
2000). Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene polymorphism is an important genetic factor for
hyperhomocysteinemia (Sibani et al.,2000).
MTHFR is a critical enzyme in folate and methionine metabolism. It irreversibly catalyzes the reduction of 5,10methylene-tetrahydrofolate to 5-methyltetrahydrofolate, which one is the methyl donor for the conversion of
homocysteine to methionine (Goyette et al., 1994). Several folate pathway genes showed single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNPs) and frequency of these polymorphisms varies greatly word wide (Rai et
al.,2010,2012a,b,2013; Yadav et al., 2017). The MTHFR gene is located on chromosome 1p36.3. Among all the
identified polymorphisms, C677T and A1298C polymorphisms are clinically important and variant MTHFR
enzymes (Ala222Val and Glu429ALa) are associated with reduced enzyme activity and hyperhomocysteinemia
(Frosst et al.,1995; Weisberg et al.,1998; Rozen,1997).
A1298C polymorphism involves A to C nucleotide substitution at 1298th position (Weisberg et al. 1998), leading to
a glutamate to alanine substitution (Glu429Ala) in the MTHFR protein. Glutamate to alanine amino acid substitution
at 429th position in MTHFR enzyme, reduces 40% enzyme activity. A1298C allele frequency differs greatly in
various ethnic groups of the world. The prevalence of the A1298C homozygote variant genotype ranges from 7 to
12% in White populations from North America and Europe and lower frequencies have been reported in Hispanics
(4 to 5 %) and Asian populations (1 to 4%) (Botto and Young, 2000). MTHFR A1298C gene polymorphism is
associated with a number of diseases like- Down syndrome (Rai et al., 2006), neural tube defects (van der Put et al.,
1997), cleft lip and palate (Chorna et al.,20011) and psychiatric disorders (Sazci et al., 2005) etc. Numerous case
control studies were investigated the association between maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism and CHD but
the results were contradictory. Hence, we performed meta-analysis of case control studies to conclude the role of
maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism in fetal CHD risk.

Methods:
Article search was carried out in four electronic databases (Pubmed, Google scholar, Elsevier and Springer Link) up
to June, 2018 using key terms - ‘methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase or MTHFR’, ‘A1298C' , 'polymorphism' and
‘congenital heart disease or CHD’. Reference list of eligible articles were also searched for relevant studies.

Following data from each included article were extracted: author name; ethnicity; country of origin; journal name;
year of publication; number of cases and controls; and number of MTHFR A1298C genotypes in mothers of CHD
cases and mothers of healthy children as controls. Inclusion and exclusion criteria:
A strict inclusion and exclusion criteria was followed to select the studies for meta-analysis. Criteria for inclusion
were as follows; (i) article should evaluated the association of maternal MTHFR A1298C gene polymorphism with
CHD; (ii) article should be case-control association study; and (iii) the articles must report the sample size,
distribution of alleles or genotypes for estimating the odds ratio (ORs) with 95% confidence interval (CIs). Studies
were excluded if one of the following existed: (i) case-only studies, (ii) studies that contained duplicate data, and
(iii) editorial, case reports or reviews.

Statistical analysis:
The present meta-analysis examined the overall association of maternal mutant C allele with the risk of CHD. The
associations were indicated as odds ratios (ORs) with the corresponding 95% CI. The OR was estimated either by
using fixed effects (Mantel and Haenszel, 1959) or random effects (DerSimonian and Laird, 1986) model depending
upon heterogeneity. The heterogeneity between studies was tested using the Q-statistic and quantified by I2 statistic
(Higgins et al., 2002).

Sensitivity analysis:
The distribution of the genotypes in the control group was tested for Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) and
sensitivity analysis performed by exclusion of the studies in which control population was not in HWE.

Publication bias:
Publication bias was investigated by using funnel plots of standard error and precision. Egger’s regression intercept
(Egger et al.,1997) was used to assess the publication bias. All p value were two sided, and p values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant. All statistical analyses were performed using the computer program MIX version
1.7 (Bax et al., 2006) and MetaAnalyst (Wallace et al.,2013).

Results:
Characteristics of included studies:
Total seventeen studies (Storti et al.,2003; Nurk et al.,2004; Galdieri et al., 2007; Van Driel et al.,2008; Xu et al.,
2010; Bozovic et al.,2011; Obermann-Borst et al.,2011; Weiner et al., 2012; Christense et al., 2013; Wang et
al.,2013; Zidan et al.,2013; Huang et al.,2014; Sahiner et al.,2014; Li et al.,2015; Sayin et al.2015; Shi et al.,2015;
Feng et al.,2016) were found suitable for the inclusion in present meta-analysis. The studies were published between
2003 and 2015. All these nine studies were performed in different countries- Brazil (Galdieri et al., 2007), China
(Xu et al., 2010; Wang et al.,2013; Huang et al.,2014; Li et al.,2015; Sayin et al.2015; Shi et al.,2015; Feng et
al.,2016), Croatia (Bozovic et al.,2011), Egypt (Zidan et al.,2013), Italy (Storti et al.,2003), Netherland (ObermannBorst et al.,2011), Norway (Nurk et al.,2004; Van Driel et al.,2008), Russia (Weiner et al., 2011), Turkey (Sahiner et
al.,2014), and USA (Christense et al., 2013). The lowest sample size was 25 (Nurk et al., 2004) and highest sample
size was 502 (Xu et al., 20101) in included studies. Total number of cases were 2514 with genotype percentage of
AA, AC and CC was 56.96%, 34.88% and 8.15% respectively. Total number of controls were 17,226 with
genotypes percentage of AA, AC and CC were 47.53%, 42.51% and 9.95% respectively.

Meta-analysis:
In allele contrast meta-analysis, maternal mutant C allele showed significant association with CHD in fixed effect
(OR= 1.14, 95%CI= 1.03-1.24, p= 0.007) and random effect (OR= 1.19, 95%CI= 0.95-1.36, p= 0.04) models (Table
2, Figure 1). Similar to allele contrast meta-analysis, pooled odds ratio for maternal mutant homozygote genotype
(CC vs. AA) also showed significant association with CHD adopting both fixed (OR= 1.40, 95% CI= 1.11-1.46, p=
0.004) and random (OR= 1.46, 95%CI= 1.00-2.13, p= 0.04) effect models (Figure 2). Association of mutant
heterozygous genotype (AC vs. AA; co-dominant model) did not show any association with CHD using fixed and
random effect models. Dominant maternal mutant genotypes (CC+AC vs. AA; dominant model) showed significant
association with CHD using both fixed (OR= 1.13; 95%CI= 1.0-1.26; p=0.04) and random (OR= 1.19; 95%CI=
0.97-1.4; p=0.04) effect models (Figure 3; Table 2). Meta-analysis using recessive genetic model (CC vs. AC+AA;
recessive model) showed significant association with CHD with fixed (OR= 1.34; 95%CI= 1.1-1.6; p=0.01) and
random (OR= 1.34; 95%CI= 0.99-1.81; p=0.28) effect models (Figure 4; Table 2).
A insignificant low heterogeneity existed in between studies for recessive model (P heterogeneity =0.06, I2= 37.8%),
significant heterogeneity existed between studies for allele contrast (P heterogeneity =0.0001, I2= 65.04%), dominant
model (Pheterogeneity =0.0005, I2= 61.34%), high heterogeneity existed between studies for homozygote (P heterogeneity
=0.005, I2= 53.68%,), and co-dominant (Pheterogeneity =0.006, I2= 52.23% ,) comparisons.

Publication bias:
Funnel plots using standard error and precision values for allele and genotypes using random effect model were
generated (Table 2; Figure 5,6). Symmetrical distribution of studies in the funnel plots suggests absence of

publication bias except co-dominant model. This is also supported by Eggers test (p= 0.29 for C vs. A; p= 0.21 for
CC vs AA; p= 0.21 for CC+AC vs. AA; p= 0.57 for CC vs. AC+AA and p= 0.04 for AC vs. AA) (Table 2).

Discussion:
Normal MTHFR activity is crucial to maintain the pool of circulating folate and methionine and to prevent the
accumulation of homocysteine (Frosst et al., 1995). Numerous case control studies have indicated an effect of the
maternal MTHFR genotype rather than that of the affected child (Martinelli et al, 2001; Prescott et al, 2002) on fetal
development. The association of MTHFR polymorphisms with the increased risk of CHD supports the protective
effect of maternal use of folic acid with respect to the occurrence of CHD.
Folate deficiency and hypofunction of MTHFR enzyme activity were affected cell proliferation and apoptosis in
developing fetus. Embryonic heart development is a complex process and proliferation and apoptosis play important
roles (Fisher et al., 2000; Gittenberger-de Groot et al.,2005; Li et al., 2005). Inadequate proliferation or excess
apoptosis can directly or indirectly result in CHD( Kruman et al.,2005). However, it is not clear whether folate
deficiency alters proliferation/ apoptosis in the heart or not (Li et al.,2005). MTHFR gene knock out mice have
reduced concentration of S-adenosylmethionine and increased concentration of S-adenosylhomocysteine, showed
hyperhomocysteinemia and global DNA hypomethylation (Chen et al., 2001)
Meta-analysis is a statistical tool which is successfully used for combining results of several small, low powered
case control studies to conclude the results with less statistical error and high statistical power. Numerous metaanalyses were published to confirm the small effect of gene polymorphism as risk factor for several disease likecleft lip and palate (Rai,2014a,2018b); NTD (Yadav et al., 2015); male infertility (Rai and Kumar,2017d), Down
syndrome (Rai,2011a; Rai et al.,2017c; Rai and Kumar,2018a); recurrent pregnancy loss (Rai,2016a), glucose 6phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency (Kumar et al.,2016), bipolar disorder (Rai,2011b), Schizophrenia( Yadav et
al.2016a, Rai et al.,2017e), autism (Rai,2016c; Rai and Kumar,2018c), Depression (Rai,2014c); Alzheimers disease
(Rai,2016b,2017a); epilepsy (Rai and Kumar, 2018d), Uterine Leiomyoma (Kumar and Rai, 2018a), hyperurecemia
(Rai,2016d), breast cancer (Rai,2014b; Rai et al.,2017b), esophageal cancer (Kumar and Rai, 2018b), lung cancer
(Rai,2014d), prostate cancer (Yadav et al.,2016b),colorectal cancer (Rai,2015), digestive tract cancer (Yadav et
al.,2018), endometrial cancer (Kumar and Rai, 2018c) and ovary cancer (Rai,2016e).
There are several limitations in current meta-analysis, which should be acknowledged- (i) unadjusted OR was used
as association measure, (ii) only one gene polymorphism (MTHFR A1298C) was considered in present metaanalysis, (iii) only four databases were searched for studies, and (iv) gene- gene and gene -environmental
interactions were not considered.
In conclusion, results of meta-analysis showed that maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism is a risk factor for
congenital heart defects in fetus. Periconceptional intake of folate reduces the risk of congenital defects, because it
donates methyl group for conversion of homocysteine to methionine and protect fetus from the teratogenic effect of
higher concentration of homocysteine. Simultaneously methionine donates methyl group to S-adenosylmethionine
for cellular methylation reactions in fetus and due to reduced MTHFR enzyme activity genomic hypomethylation
occurs which affects gene expression in developing fetus. In future, larger studies from different regional as well as
different ethnic population are required to find out the exact effect of maternal MTHFR A1298C polymorphism on
fetal heart.
