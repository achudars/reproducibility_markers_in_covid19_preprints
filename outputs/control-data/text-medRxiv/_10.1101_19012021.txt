ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND:
Disentangling the genetic constellation underlying Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is important. Doing
so allows us to identify biological pathways underlying AD, point towards novel drug targets and
use the variants for individualised risk predictions in disease modifying or prevention trials. In
the present work we report on the largest genome-wide association study (GWAS) for AD risk to
date and show the combined utility of proven AD loci for precision medicine using polygenic risk
scores (PRS).
METHODS:
Three sets of summary statistics were included in our meta-GWAS of AD: an Spanish casecontrol study (GR@ACE/DEGESCO study, n = 12,386), the case-control study of International
Genomics of Alzheimer project (IGAP, n = 82,771) and the UK Biobank (UKB) AD-by-proxy
case-control study (n=314,278). Using these resources, we performed a fixed-effects inversevariance-weighted meta-analysis. Detected loci were confirmed in a replication study of 19,089
AD cases and 39,101 controls from 16 European-ancestry cohorts not previously used. We
constructed a weighted PRS based on the 39 AD variants. PRS were generated by multiplying the
genotype dosage of each risk allele for each variant by its respective weight, and then summing
across all variants. We first validated it for AD in independent data (assessing effects of subthreshold signal, diagnostic certainty, age at onset and sex) and tested its effect on risk (odds for
disease) and age at onset in the GR@ACE/DEGESCO study.
FINDINGS:
Using our meta-GWAS approach and follow-up analysis, we identified novel genome-wide
significant associations of six genetic variants with AD risk (rs72835061-CHRNE, rs2154481APP, rs876461-PRKD3/NDUFAF7, rs3935877-PLCG2 and two missense variants:
rs34173062/rs34674752 in SHARPIN gene) and confirmed a stop codon mutation in the IL34
gene increasing the risk of AD (IL34-Tyr213Ter), and two other variants in PLCG2 and HS3ST1
regions. This brings the total number of genetic variants associated with AD to 39 (excluding
APOE). The PRS based on these variants was associated with AD in an independent clinical ADcase control dataset (OR=1.30, per 1-SD increase in the PRS, 95%CI 1.18-1.44, p = 1.1×10-7), a
similar effect to that in the GR@ACE/DEGESCO (OR=1.27, 95%CI 1.23-1.32, p = 7.4×10-39).
We then explored the combined effects of these 39 variants in a PRS for AD risk and age-at-onset
stratification in GR@ACE/DEGESCO. Excluding APOE, we observed a gradual risk increase
over the 2% tiles; when comparing the extremes, those with the 2% highest risk had a 2.98-fold
(95% CI 2.12–4.18, p = 3.2×10-10) increased risk compared to those with the 2% lowest risk (p =
5.9×10-10). Using the PRS we identified APOE ɛ33 carriers with a similar risk as APOE ɛ4
heterozygotes carriers, as well as APOE ɛ4 heterozygote carriers with a similar risk as APOE ɛ4
homozygote. Considering age at onset; there was a 9-year difference between median onset of
AD the lowest risk group and the highest risk group (82 vs 73 years; p = 1.6×10-6); a 4-year
median onset difference (81 vs 77 years; p = 6.9×10-5) within APOE e4 heterozygotes and a 5.5year median onset difference (78.5 vs 73 years; p = 4.6×10-5) within APOE e4 carriers.
INTERPRETATION:
We identified six novel genetic variants associated with AD-risk, among which one common APP
variant. A PRS of all genetic loci reported to date could be a robust tool to predict the risk and
age at onset of AD, beyond APOE alone. These properties make PRS instrumental in selecting
individuals at risk in order to apply preventative strategies and might have potential use in
diagnostic work-up.

Introduction
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common neurodegenerative disorder affecting
elderly populations worldwide1. A small fraction of the occurrence of AD in patients can
be explained by rare mutations which cause the autosomal dominant forms of AD (<
1%)2. For non-familial cases, the genetic contribution to AD risk is estimated to be
between 60–80%3 and likely consists of a combination of common and rare alleles, each
with low to moderate effects on AD risk, gene–gene and gene–environmental
interactions.
Thus far, multiple loci associated with AD have been described next to causal mutations
in the PSEN1, PSEN2 and APP genes. The most prominent locus, APOE, was detected
almost 30 years ago using linkage techniques4. APOE allele ɛ4 has a strong effect,
conferring a threefold increased risk for AD in heterozygous carriers of the ɛ4 allele and
an 8-to-12-fold risk in the homozygous state5. After a long and unsuccessful search for
additional AD loci, the development of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays
permitted the design of comprehensive genome-wide association studies (GWAS).
Successive waves of analysis and meta-analysis with increasing sample sizes have been
performed to disentangle the genetic background of AD. By combining the information
from more than 80,000 participants, the International Genetics of Alzheimer’s project
(IGAP) recently released the largest meta-analysis of case-control studies reported to
date6. In parallel with this case-control analysis, by-proxy AD case-control datasets of
Alzheimer’s disease have successfully been used to increase the statistical power of
previous AD GWAS7. These approaches use the UK Biobank (UKB)8, a cohort study of
over half a million individuals in the UK in which the history of dementia for the parents
is used instead of traditional case-control studies9. The by-proxy strategy confirmed the
loci identified by IGAP and identified additional candidate loci previously undetected by
conventional case-control approaches9,10. Overall, in addition to APOE, there have to date
been identified more than 30 loci have been identified to date that modify the risk of
AD11–16. These signals, combined with ‘subthreshold’ common variant associations,
account for ~31% of the genetic variance of AD, leaving most of the genetic risk as yet
uncharacterised17. A meta-study combining all these studies may lead to the identification
of associations of genetic loci with AD and might help to confirm loci previously
proposed by proxy-AD strategies but requiring additional validations. Larger GWASs are
also important to identify the causative variants, pinpoint culprit genes in the ADassociated genomic regions and identify the biological pathways underlying AD.
In addition to the biological insights, disentangling the genetic constellation of common
genetic variations underlying AD has clinical relevance. First, genetic associations can
point towards novel drug targets. One example is the discovery of the TREM2 gene, which
has led to the development of TREM2 modulators17. These drugs are now being evaluated
in trials18 in hopes of benefiting patients in the near-distant future. Second, presymptomatic AD patients are increasingly included in treatment or prevention trials. To
reduce the necessary duration of these costly studies, individuals at high genetic risk of
developing the disease are included19,20, such as patients carrying a mutation that causes
familial AD and those carrying an APOE e4 allele are included as high-risk individuals
in clinical trials18,19. Other common and rare AD loci are neglected, as the effect or
frequency of the individual loci is often small. The combined effect of all these loci,

however, could account for a substantial proportion of variation in risk21. Indeed,
combining the effects of all currently known variants results in a polygenic risk score
(PRS) that is associated with conversion of mild cognitive impairment to AD22,23 the
neuropathological hallmarks of AD, age at onset of disease24–26 and lifetime risk of AD27.
However, the discovery of more variants associated with AD warrant that PRS are
updated and again validated. Further it is important to know how diagnostic certainty, age
at onset and sex influence the effects of the PRS.
Here we aimed to comprehend and expand the knowledge of the genetic landscape
underlying AD. We first performed a meta-GWAS integrating all currently published
GWAS case-control data, by-proxy case-control data and the data from the Genome
Research at Fundació ACE (GR@ACE) study28. We confirm the novel observed
associations in a large independent replication study. Then constructed an update of the
PRS and test if the effects of the PRS are influenced by diagnostic certainty, sex and age
at onset groups. Last, we test if the PRS can be used to identify individuals at highest risk.

Methods
Meta-GWAS of AD
This study utilizes the summary statistics from three AD GWAS: the summary statistics
calculated from the GR@ACE28 case-control study, the International Genomics of
Alzheimer project (IGAP)29 case-control study and UKB AD-by-proxy case-control
study9 (Figure 1).
GR@ACE
The GR@ACE study28 recruited AD patients from Fundació ACE, Institut Català de
Neurociències Aplicades (Catalonia, Spain) and control individuals from three centres:
Fundació ACE (Barcelona, Spain), Valme University Hospital (Seville, Spain) and the
Spanish National DNA Bank Carlos III (University of Salamanca, Spain)
(http://www.bancoadn.org). Additional cases and controls were obtained from dementia
cohorts included in the Dementia Genetics Spanish Consortium (DEGESCO)30. At all
sites AD diagnosis was established by a multidisciplinary working group, including
neurologists, neuropsychologists and social workers, according to the DSM-IV criteria
for dementia and the National Institute on Aging and Alzheimer’s Association’s (NIA–
AA) 2011 guidelines for diagnosing AD. In the present study we considered as AD cases
any individuals with dementia diagnosed with probable or possible AD at any point in
their clinical course. For further details on the contribution of the sites, see Supplementary
Table 1. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. The Ethics and
Scientific Committees have approved this research protocol (Acta 25/2016, Ethics
Committee. H., Clinic I Provincial, Barcelona, Spain).
Genotyping, quality control and imputation
DNA was extracted from peripheral blood. Genotyping was conducted using the Axiom
815K Spanish Biobank array (Thermo Fisher) at the Spanish National Centre for
Genotyping (CeGEN, Santiago de Compostela, Spain) (Supplementary information,
methods). We conducted previously described standard quality control prior to

imputation28. In brief, individual quality control includes genotype call rates > 97%, sex
checks and no excess heterozygosity; we removed population outliers as well (European
cluster of 1000 Genomes). We included variants with a call rate > 95%, with minor allele
frequency (MAF) > 0.01, in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (p < 1×10-4 in controls) and
without differential missingness between cases and controls (Supplementary Table 2,
Supplementary Figure 1). Imputation was carried out using the Haplotype reference
consortium31 (HRC, full panel) and the 1000 Genomes reference panel32 (for indels only)
on the Michigan Imputation server (https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu). Rare
variants (MAF < 0.001) and variants with low imputation quality (R2 < 0.30) were
excluded. Logistic regression models, adjusted for the first four ancestry principal
components28, were fitted using Plink (v2.00a). Population-based controls were used;
therefore, age was not included as a covariate (Supplementary Table 3). After quality
control steps, we included 6,331 AD cases and 6,055 control individuals and tested
14,542,816 genetic variants for association with AD.
IGAP summary statistics
GWAS summary results from the IGAP were downloaded from the National Institute on
Aging Genetics of Alzheimer's Disease Data Storage Site (NIAGADS,
https://www.niagads.org/)29. Details on data generation and the analyses by IGAP have
been previously described29. In brief, IGAP is a large study based upon genome-wide
association using individuals of European ancestry. Stage 1 of IGAP comprises 21,982
Alzheimer’s disease cases and 41,944 cognitively normal controls from four consortia:
the Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC), the European Alzheimer's Disease
Initiative (EADI), the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology
Consortium (CHARGE) and the Genetic and Environmental Risk in AD Consortium
Genetic and Environmental Risk in AD/Defining Genetic, Polygenic and Environmental
Risk for Alzheimer’s Disease Consortium (GERAD/PERADES). Summary statistics are
available for 11,480,632 variants, both genotyped and imputed (1000 Genomes
phase1v3). In Stage 2, 11,632 SNPs were genotyped in an independent set of 8,362
Alzheimer's disease cases and 10,483 controls.
UK Biobank summary statistics
UK Biobank data, including health, cognitive and genetic data, were collected on over
500,000 individuals aged 37–73 years from across Great Britain (England, Wales and
Scotland) at the study baseline (2006–2010) (http://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk)33. Several
groups have demonstrated the utility of self-report of parental history of AD for case
ascertainment in GWAS (Proxy–AD approach)7,9,10. For this study we used the published
summary statistics of Marioni et al.9. They included, after stringent quality control,
314,278 unrelated individuals for whom AD information was available on at least one
parent in UK Biobank (https://datashare.is.ed.ac.uk/handle/10283/3364). In brief, the
genetic data of 27,696 participants whose mother had dementia (maternal cases) were
compared with the 260,980 participants whose mother did not have dementia. Likewise,
the 14,338 participants whose father had dementia (paternal cases) were compared with
the 245,941 participants whose father did not have dementia9. The phenotype of the
parents is independent, and therefore the estimates could be meta-analysed. After
analysis, the effect estimates were made comparable to a case-control setting. Further
information on the transformation of the effect sizes can be found elsewhere9,34. The data

available comprises summary statistics of 7,794,553 SNPs imputed to the HRC reference
panel (full panel).
Data analysis
After study-specific variant filtering and quality-control procedures, we performed a
fixed-effects inverse-variance-weighted meta-analysis35 on the summary statistics
mentioned above.
To determine the variants with the strongest association per genomic region, we
performed clumping on SNPs with a genome-wide significant p-value (p < 5×10-8) (Plink
v1.90, maximal linkage disequilibrium (LD) with R2 < 0.001 and physical distance 1 Mb).
In the APOE region, the significance level (p ~ 0 for multiple SNPs) interferes with
clumping; therefore, only the variants determining the APOE ɛ4 and APOE ɛ2 alleles
were kept in this region36 (rs429358 and rs7412). LD information was calculated using
the GR@ACE imputed genotypes as a reference. Chromosomal regions associated with
AD in previous studies were excluded from follow-up (Lambert et al.12, Kunkle et al.6,
Jansen et al.10). We also performed a functional annotation using FUMA37 (see
‘Supplementary Methods’).
Confirmation of loci containing novel associations with AD loci
We searched for independent evidence of association with AD for the variants with
suggestive association (p < 10-5) located in proximity (200 Kb) to nine loci selected for
follow-up. This strategy was adopted in order to allow for potential refinement of the top
associated variants during the replication effort. For this confirmatory experiment we
studied 19,089 AD cases and 39,101 controls not used in the GRA@CE or IGAP studies
from 16 additional cohorts many of them collected and analysed by the European
Alzheimer Disease Biobank project (JPND-EADB). See Supplementary Table 3 for
details of AD cases included in this study and their origin and Supplementary Information
for descriptions of the replication cohorts). Logistic regression models were fitted with a
minimum of four principal ancestry components to correct for the population
substructure. Inverse variance weighted meta-analysis was performed on all datasets in
both discovery and follow-up stages.
Conditional analyses were performed in regions where multiple variants were associated
with AD using logistic regression models adjusting for the genetic variants in the region.
In the chr17-SCIMP region we adjusted rs75511804 for rs72835017, and in the chr16PLCG2 region we adjusted rs12444183 for rs3935877 and rs72824905.
Polygenic Risk Scores
Validation of PRS in clinical and pathologically confirmed AD cases
We calculated a weighted individual PRS based on the 39 genetic variants that showed
genome-wide significant evidence of association with AD in the present study (Figure 2,
Supplementary Table 4). Selected variants were directly genotyped or imputed with high
quality (median imputation score R² = 0.93). PRS were generated by multiplying the
genotype dosage of each risk allele for each variant by its respective weight, and then

summing across all variants. We weighted by the effect size from previous IGAP studies
(Kunkle6 (36 variants), Sims16 (2 variants), Jun38 (MAPT locus), Supplementary Table 4).
We validate the PRS in a sample of 676 AD cases diagnosed based on clinical criteria
and 332 pathologically confirmed AD cases from the European Alzheimer’s Disease
Biobank (EADB)–Fundació ACE/Barcelona Brain Bank dataset (EADB–F.ACE/BBB,
Supplementary information). This dataset was not used in any genetic study. In this
dataset all pathologically confirmed cases were scored for the presence or absence of
concomitant pathologies. In all analyses we compared the AD patients to the same
population-based control dataset (n = 1,386). We performed analyses to test the
robustness of the PRS. We first tested the effect of adding additional variants below the
genome-wide significance threshold using a pruning and thresholding approach. For this
we used the summary statistics of IGAP29 study and we selected independent variants
using the clump_data() function from the TwoSampleMR package (version 0.4.25). We
used standard settings for clumping (R2=0.001 and window=1MB) and increasing pvalue thresholds (>1×10-7, >1×10-6, >1×10-5, >1×10-4, >1×10-3, >1×10-2). We tested the
association of the resulting with clinically diagnosed AD patients and pathologically
confirmed AD patients. To evaluate the effect of diagnostic certainty we tested if the PRS
was different between these two AD groups. For the PRS with 39 genome-wide
significant variants we tested if there were sex-specific effects of the PRS, if the effect
was different age-of-onset groups of AD and the effect of the PRS in the presence of
concomitant brain pathologies.
Risk stratification of the validated PRSs
After validation of the PRS we searched for the groups at largest risk of AD in the large
GR@ACE dataset (6,331 AD cases and 6,055 controls). We stratified the population into
PRS (percent)tiles taking into account survival bias that is anticipated at old age27. To
eliminate selection bias calculated the boundaries of the percentiles in the control
participants aged 55 years and younger (n = 3,546). Based on the boundaries from this
population the rest of the controls and all AD cases were then assigned into their
appropriate percentiles. We first explored risk stratification using only the PRSs. For this
we split the PRSs into 50 groups (2-percentiles) and compared all groups of subjects with
the group that had the lowest PRS. Secondly, we explored risk stratification considering
both APOE genotypes and the PRSs. The APOE genotypes were pooled in analyses as
APOE ɛ22/ɛ23 (n = 998, split into 7 PRS groups), APOE ɛ33 (n = 7,611, split into 25 PRS
groups), APOE ɛ24/ɛ34 (n = 3,399, split into 15 PRS groups) and APOE ɛ44 (n = 382,
split into 3 PRS groups). We studied the effect of PRS across groups of individuals
stratified by APOE genotypes with the lowest PRS group (APOE as the reference group
using logistic regression models adjusted for four population ancestry components).
Finally, we compared the median age at onset using a Wilcoxon test. All analyses were
done in R (version 3.4.2).

Results
Genome-wide association study
We performed a meta-analysis of the summary statistics of the GR@ACE study (6,331
AD cases and 6,055 controls), the IGAP consortium (up to 30,344 AD cases and 52,427
controls) and the UK Biobank AD-proxy study (27,696 cases of maternal AD with
260,980 controls and 14,338 cases of paternal AD with 245,941 controls (Figure 1,
Supplementary Table 3). Although we observed inflation in the resulting summary
statistics (λ median = 1.08; see Supplementary Figure 2), it was not driven by an
unmodelled population structure (LD score regression intercept = 1.036). We compared
the results obtained to a second meta-analysis using only the case-control datasets (IGAP
Stage 1–2 and GR@ACE datasets as a sensitivity analysis to identify false negative
results due to possible dilution by the by-proxy approach in the UK Biobank
(Supplementary Table 5). We identified a genome-wide significant association (p < 5×108
) for 36 independent genetic variants in 35 genomic regions and two additional
suggestive associations. The APOE locus contained two independent signals
corresponding to the ɛ4 and ɛ2 alleles, respectively. The meta-analysis, including the byproxy summary statistics, identified 11 additional loci reaching genome-wide
significance with respect to case-control-only results. The incorporation of by-proxy
summary statistics did not show an association in two previously reported AD loci
(rs7185636-IQCK and rs386572859-MAPT) by the IGAP consortium29,38 and replicated
in the GR@ACE dataset (OR = 0.93 [0.90-0.95], p = 4.5×10-8 and OR = 0.81 [0.75-0.87],
p=7.9×10-9, respectively). We observed high correlation between the effect estimates
from the case-control and by-proxy approach for the significant loci (R2 = 0.994, p =
8.1×10-37; Supplementary Figure 3).
Among the 36 detected genome-wide significant (GWS) variants, 31 variants (86%) were
reported in previously published studies or were in complete LD with known AD loci
(Supplementary Table 5). We followed up the four novel genetic regions. We also
followed up five genomic regions of interest, which were still awaiting replication
(PLCG2 and IL-34)9, in incomplete linkage disequilibrium with top SNPs previously
reported loci10,39 (a locus near the HS3ST120 gene) or showed only suggestive level of
association (p < 1×10-7; ELK2AP and SPPL2A). We tested all variants in these nine
genomic loci reaching suggestive level of association (p < 1×10-5) in the replication
cohorts using 16 independent European-based cohorts (n cases = 19,087 and n controls =
39,101). In these nine genomic regions we tested 384 variants in the follow-up
(Supplementary Table 6).
In the follow-up data found association signal in the same direction as the discovery in
seven out of the nine genomic regions (Table 1, Supplementary Table 6 and
Supplementary Figures 4–12). We combined discovery and follow-up and found in these
seven genomic regions, nine independent genetic variants that reached GWS significance
for association with AD (Table 1). Four of the genomic regions were not previously
associated with AD and those are marked in the Manhattan-plot (Figure 2). We briefly
discuss the results below.
Two genomic regions contain strong candidate AD genes (APP and SHARPIN) but
variants in the region had not reached genome-wide significance in earlier meta9

GWAS15,35. In APP we identified a very common (MAF = 0.46) intronic variant that
associated with a reduced risk of AD (rs2154481, OR = 0.95 [0.93–0.96], p = 9.3×10-10).
In SHARPIN we found two missense mutations (p.Ser17Phe and p.Pro294Ser) that are in
linkage equilibrium (R2 = 1.3×10-6, D' = 0.014 and p = 0.96). The SHARPIN p.Ser17Phe
(MAF = 0.085) was significant in the discovery as well as the follow-up. In all data
combined we found the variant associated with a 1.14-fold increased risk of AD
(rs34173062, 95%CI 1.10–1.18, p = 9.6×10-13). SHARPIN p.Pro294Ser (MAF = 0.052)
was significant after meta-analysing all data (rs34674752, OR = 1.13 [1.09–1.18], p =
1.0×10-9). The fourth variant is in a genomic region at chromosome 2, close to the genes
PRKD3 and NDUFAF7. The variant rs876461 (MAF = 0.143) was borderline significant
in discovery (OR = 1.07 [1.04-1.09], p = 9.1×10-7) but emerged as the most significant
variant in the region after in the combined analysis (OR = 1.07 [1.05-1.09], p = 1.3×109
). The fifth association was in the 3'-UTR region of CHRNE (Cholinergic Receptor
Nicotinic Epsilon Subunit). rs72835061 (MAF = 0.085) associated with a 1.09-fold
increased risk of AD (95%CI 1.06-1.11, p = 1.5×10-10). This variant is relatively close to
the SCIMP10 locus (333 Kb) and was in weak LD (R2 = 0.139, D' = 0.446 and p < 0.0001)
with the SCIMP top variant (rs75511804-SCIMP). A conditional analysis, including
GR@ACE and the independent follow-up (Supplementary Table 7), showed similar
effect sizes for rs72835017 after adjustment for rs75511804-SCIMP (and vice versa), in
line with two independent signals that are in weak LD.
We strengthened the evidence of association with AD for three genomic regions. First,
rs4351014 with AD (combined-OR = 0.94 [0.92-0.95], p = 9.2×10-12). This variant is in
a gene poor region but has previously been linked to HS3ST1. A stop codon mutation
(rs4985556, Tyr213Ter, MAF = 0.111) in the interleukin 34 (IL34) gene was previously
reported to be associated in a by-proxy approach9. We confirmed this associated with an
increased AD risk in both discovery and follow-up (combined OR = 1.08 [1.06-1.11], p
= 3.9×10-10). The genomic region that contains the PLCG2 gene has been associated with
AD twice (the rare missense variant p.P522R in the PLCG2 gene16 and rs12444183 near
the promotor region of PLCG29). After combination of discovery and follow-up a third
independent association signal emerged in the PLCG2 region (rs3935877, effect allele
frequency = 0.868, OR = 0.92 [0.90-0.95], p = 6.9×10-9). We also strengthen the
association of PLCG2-rs12444183 with AD (MAF = 0.407, combined-OR = 0.95[0.930.96], p = 6.8×10-12). Conditional analyses in the PLCG2 region showed the association
signal of all three variants (including the missense variant p.P522R in PLCG216) in the
PLCG2 locus are independent (Supplementary Table 8).
The two loci reaching suggestive evidence of association (Table 1) in the discovery
(rs7153315-ELK2AP and rs76523702-SPPL2A) did not replicate in the follow-up
(rs76523702-SPPL2A, p = 0.35) or showed association in the opposite direction
(rs7153315-ELK2AP, ORdiscovery = 0.94 vs ORfollow-up = 1.16, Table 1).
To link the novel variants to specific genes and functional motifs in their genomic regions,
we applied different strategies implemented on the FUMA platform (see ‘Supplementary
Methods’). The selected candidate genes were implicated at least in three mapping
strategies using this approach (APP, IL34, CHRNE, PLCG2 and SHARPIN,
Supplementary Tables 9–12, Supplementary Figure 13).

Validation of PRS for dementia
In total, after combined meta-analysis, 39 variants have been associated with AD at
genome-wide significance (excluding the APOE region). We used these 39 variants and
IGAP weighted effects to construct a PRS (Supplementary Table 4).
The PRS showed a stronger association with the pathologically confirmed AD cases (OR
= 1.38, per 1-SD increase in the PRS, 95% CI [1.21–1.58]) than with clinical AD cases
(OR = 1.30, 95%CI [1.18–1.44]) (Figure 3A). However, this difference was not
statistically significant. We then investigated whether adding additional variants below
the genome-wide significance threshold would lead to increased performance of the PRS.
In both pathological and clinical AD cases, the association (as measured by the p-value
of the effect estimate from logistic regression models) of the PRS decreased when adding
to PRS variants below the conventional GWAS significance threshold (Figure 3A).
Concomitant brain pathologies were present in 84% of histopathological confirmed cases,
and the PRS was associated AD cases with all tested concomitant pathologies. The
strongest risk increase per 1-SD of the PRS was observed with concomitant hippocampal
sclerosis (OR = 1.67, 95%CI [1.22–2.28]), Figure 3B). The smallest effect for the PRS
was observed in the 16% of cases that had only AD pathology (OR = 1.22, 95%CI [0.92–
1.61]). The AD patients in our series often had more than one concomitant pathology
(48.8%), but there was no difference in the effect estimate of the PRS when more than
one pathology was present (Figure 3B).
Finally, we investigated the differential effect of sex and age at onset on the effect
estimate of the PRS (Figure 3C). The effect of the PRS was comparable in males (OR =
1.33 per 1-SD, p = 5.8×10-4) and females (OR = 1.32 per 1-SD, p = 2.5×10-7). Overall,
there were significant effects of the PRS on AD risk in all five-year age-at-onset groups.
The strongest effect was observed in the group with an age at onset of 70–75 (OR = 1.58,
per 1 SD, p = 4.1×10-7).
Risk stratification using polygenic risk scores and APOE
In the independent AD cohort, the PRS of 39 variants showed the strongest association
with AD (Figure 3). We therefore used this PRS in the large GR@ACE dataset (6,331
AD cases and 6,055 controls) to identify those at highest genetic risk of AD. Overall, the
PRS was associated with a 1.27-fold (95% CI 1.23–1.32) increased risk for every standard
deviation increase in the PRS (p = 7.3×10-39). When we stratified all individuals into 2%
percentiles of the PRS, we observed a gradual risk increase over the 2% percentile groups
(Figure 4A, Supplementary Table 13), and when comparing the extremes, those with the
2% highest risk had a 2.98-fold (95% CI 2.12–4.18) increased risk compared to those
with the 2% lowest risk (p = 3.2×10-10).
We then studied the ability of the PRS to identify high individuals at risk of the subjects
within and across APOE genotype groups. The APOE categories were split into PRS
subgroups depending on number or subjects available: seven PRS groups for the APOE
ɛ22/ɛ23 genotype, 25 for APOE ɛ33, 15 for APOE ɛ24/ɛ34 and three for APOE ɛ44.
Within each APOE genotype category we found that the group of individuals with the
highest PRS score had a higher risk compared to the lowest scored group (Figure 4B).

There was a 2.48-fold increased risk for APOE ɛ22/ɛ23 (p = 3.4×10-4), 2.67-fold for
APOE ɛ33 (p = 3.5×10-9), 2.47-fold for APOE ɛ24/ɛ34 (p = 6.8×10-6) and 2.02-fold for
APOE ɛ44 (p = 3.4×10-2). The PRS is able to modify the risk associated with APOE such
that APOE ɛ22/ɛ23 carriers with the highest PRS has a significantly higher risk than
APOE ɛ33 carriers in the lowest scored group (p = 7.8×10-4), APOE ɛ33 carriers in the
highest PRS group has a risk comparable to APOE ɛ4 heterozygote carriers with the
lowest PRS (p = 0.40), and APOE ɛ4 heterozygotes with the highest PRS was not
significantly different from APOE ɛ4 homozygotes with the lowest PRS (p = 0.68).
Finally, we compared the risk extremes and found a 16.2-fold (95% CI 8.84–29.5, p =
1.5×10-19) increased risk for the highest-PRS group compared to the lowest-PRS group
(the highest PRS APOE ɛ44 group vs the lowest PRS APOE ɛ22/ɛ23 group)
(Supplementary Table 14).
The stratification of individuals by PRS and APOE genotype also influences age at onset.
We found a significant (pWilcoxon = 1.7×10-6) difference of 9 years in the median age at
onset in individuals with the lowest PRS (the median onset is 82 years for APOE ɛ22/ɛ23
with the lowest PRS) compared with individuals with the highest risk (the median onset
is 73 years for APOE ɛ44 with the highest PRS risk) (Figure 4C). The PRS did not
determine age at onset in either APOE ɛ22/ɛ23 (lowest = 82 years, highest = 83 years,
pWilcoxon = 0.39) or APOE ɛ33 (lowest = 82 years, highest = 81 years, p = 0.16). By
contrast, in the APOE ɛ4 heterozygotes, the PRS determined a 4-year difference (pWilcoxon
= 6.9×10-5) in median age at onset between the lowest-risk (81 years) and highest-risk
(77 years) tiles. Moreover, although the PRS did not have a significant effect on risk
within APOE ɛ4 homozygotes, it did determine a 5.5-year difference in median age at
onset (pWilcoxon= 4.6×10-5) between the low-risk (median = 78.5 years) and high-risk (73
years) tiles.

Discussion
In the present work we report on the largest meta-GWAS for AD risk to date comprising
genetic information of 467,623 individuals of European ancestry. Using our meta-GWAS
approach and follow-up analysis, we identified four genomic regions that are significantly
associated with the risk of AD for the first time (in CHRNE, APP, SHARPIN and near
PRKD3/NDUFAF7). We also strengthen the association of the PLCG2 region with AD
by the identification of an additional association signal in the region. This brings the total
of genetic variants associated with AD to 39 (excluding APOE variants and the very rare
coding variants). We validated a PRS based on these variants and show that this PRS can
identify individuals at highest genetic risk of AD independent of APOE. In fact, with this
PRS we can identify APOE e3 homozygote carriers who have comparable risk for AD as
APOE e4 heterozygote carriers, as well as APOE e4 heterozygote carriers who have
comparable risk for AD as APOE e4 homozygotes carriers. We also demonstrate that the
PRS determines a 4 to 5.5-year age-at-onset difference within APOE e4 carriers. We
conclude that the PRS of the currently known genetic risk of AD captures important
differences in AD risk and age at onset. The effects of both risk stratification and age at
onset are important for research studies and clinical trials.
The work presented builds on a long, ongoing global effort of genetic researchers to
identify genetic loci associated with AD using family-based studies and genome-wide

association studies. We have summarised the landscape of AD genetics of the last 30
years in Figure 5. We can observe that with the increasing sample sizes across studies,
more and more variants are found. After review of the literature, we estimate that the
culprit variant is known in only 15 (40%) out of 39 loci (Table 2). Therefore, much is to
be gained from candidate gene studies in these other loci. With the current work we have
added six novel genetic variants in five genetic loci to the landscape; they are discussed
below.
The most interesting finding of this work was the confirmation of a very common variant
in the APP locus (rs2154481, MAF (C-allele) = 0.483). The C-allele of this SNP confers
subtle protection against AD to the carriers (OR = 0.95 [0.94-0-96], p = 1.39×10-11). The
genetic marker is in a DNase hypersensitive area of 295 bp (chr21:27473781-27474075)
probably involved in the transcriptional regulation of the APP gene. Indeed, the variant
is an eQTL for the APP mRNA and antisense transcript of the APP gene named
AP001439.2 in public eQTL databases40 (Supplementary Figure 14). Importantly in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of 726 individuals41, the protective variant increased
expression of the APP transcript.
Additional functional evidence supporting the role of this region in the modulation of the
APP transcript has been published recently42. Specifically, Craig et al. describe a block
of 13 SNPs within the APP locus associated with intellectual abilities in children. This
LD block, including our top hit for AD (rs2154481), was associated with intelligence (IQ)
in children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, n =
5,165, beta = 1.36, p = 3.5×10-5 for the rs2154481 C-allele). The authors suggest that this
LD block within APP is involved in the control of gene expression in this locus. Using
EMSA and luciferase reporter assays, they demonstrate that the C-allele of a linked SNP
(rs2830077) increased the TFCP2 transcription factor avidity to its binding site and
increased the enhancer activity of this specific intronic region42. Interestingly, the C-allele
of the proposed marker (rs2830077) is in high LD with the C-allele of rs2154481 detected
in our study (LDlink, D'= 0.94, R2 = 0.87, p < 0.0001). The results support increased APP
gene expression. It is not necessary to mention that the APP locus has been one of the
major drivers of the classic amyloid hypothesis for AD43,44. Now, our results reconcile
autosomal dominant and complex Alzheimer disease genetic causality. The
incontrovertible demonstration of the existence of the common variant within the APP
associated with sporadic AD and full penetrance mutations affecting autosomal dominant
AD strongly supports a common causal path. Hence, our results ultimately confirm the
role of APP physiology in not only early-onset Alzheimer’s disease but also late-onset
AD, as recently proposed by the IGAP consortium29. Nevertheless, the expression results
linked to the rs2154481 might appear somehow counterintuitive because increased
expression of the APP mRNA appeared to be related to disease protection. This could be
due to potential hormesis or U-effect properties of this locus, where discrete increases of
the wild-type (non-mutated) APP transcript could be protective and increased expression
of the mutant gene might be harmful45. The hormesis theory, if true, might help to explain
the accelerated cognitive deterioration observed in AD patients treated to reduce betaamyloid in their brain using beta-secretase inhibitors46,47. An alternative hypothesis
proposes that rs2154481 mechanisms could be related to the overexpression of protective
fragments of the APP protein48. Regardless, we feel that more basic research is needed to
understand the observed association. We are confident that disentangling first the culprit
variant and then the molecular mechanism associated with rs2154481 hit will help to
refine the amyloid hypothesis.

We found two missense variants in SHARPIN associated with AD. Both variants have a
relatively large effect (Figure 5), which strongly suggests that SHARPIN is the culprit
gene in the locus. SHARPIN was proposed as a candidate gene for AD by prioritisation
of GWAS signals using protein network analysis49 and by genetic association in the
Japanese population50. In the Japanese study, a rare nonsynonymous variant,
rs572750141 (NM_030974.3:p.Gly186Arg) was associated at suggestive significance
with an increased risk of AD. The amino-acid change resulted in aberrant cellular
localisation of the variant protein and attenuated the activation of NF-κB, a central
mediator of inflammatory and immune responses. Furthermore, spontaneous mutations
in the mouse SHARPIN gene resulted in immune system dysregulation51, and rs34173062
was associated with changes in blood cell indices—specifically myeloid white cell and
compound white cell52 changes. Our findings confirm SHARPIN as an important AD
gene, and the effect of the missense mutations on immunity can be directly studied in cell
models.
We also found a PRKD3/NDUFAF7 signal in our meta-GWAS, but the top hit shifted
during the overall meta-analysis. Still, the locus retained genome-wide significance,
requiring future independent replication. It is important to emphasise that it is an excellent
candidate for further follow-up. The protein kinase D (PKD) family of serine/threonine
protein kinases occupy a unique position in signalling pathways initiated by
diacylglycerol and protein kinase C. PKDs are involved in resistance to oxidative stress,
cell survival, migration, differentiation and proliferation53.
We confirmed an intronic variant in CHRNE gene (rs72835061). Functional analysis of
the discovery dataset already supported CHRNE as the most likely culprit gene. In fact,
the rs72835061 variant is a strong eQTL of CHRNE in which the allele C decreases the
expression in the brain and many other tissues according to GTEx (top differential
expression in the frontal cortex, p = 2.1×10-13) (Supplementary Figure 15). The CHRNE
locus encodes the Homo sapiens cholinergic receptor (AChR), nicotinic epsilon, which
is expressed in muscles and associated with congenital myasthenic syndrome (fastchannel type)54. Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are a group of rare genetic
disorders of the neurological junction that can result in structural or functional weakness.
A change in the ε subunit leads to an increase or decrease in AChR protein signalling,
which impairs cell-to-cell communication in the neuromuscular junction55. The detection
of a potential hypomorph allele linked to AD risk and affecting cholinergic function could
re-introduce this neurotransmitter pathway into the search for preventative strategies.
Further functional studies are needed to consolidate this hypothesis.
For the PLCG2 locus we obtained independent replication for rs12444183 and new
genome-wide significance for rs3935877. The rare protective missense mutation in
PLCG216 (p.Pro522Arg) and now two other different haplotypes around PLCG2
associated with AD reinforce the role of this genomic region in AD susceptibility. The
dissection of the molecular mechanism behind these potential regulatory variants might
help to elucidate the gain or loss of the function mechanism of the PLCG2 gene. This
information could be critical for drug-targeting purposes56.
So far not much attention has gone to a loss-of-function variant (p.Tyr213Ter) in
interleukin IL34. In a previous AD-by-proxy study, Marioni et al.9 suggested IL34rs4985556, but independent replication was pending. Interleukin-34 is a cytokine that

promotes the differentiation and viability of monocytes and macrophages through the
colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF-1R)57. It promotes the release of
proinflammatory chemokines and, thereby plays an important role in innate immunity
and inflammatory processes58. Furthermore, microglia treated with IL-34 attenuated the
oligomeric amyloid-b neurotoxicity in primary neuron-microglia co-cultures59.
Intracerebroventricular administration of IL-34 ameliorated the impairment of associative
learning and reduced oligomeric amyloid-b levels in an APP/PS1 transgenic mouse
model of AD. Therefore, this stop codon could increase the risk of AD by reducing the
neuroprotective properties of IL34 against the neurotoxicity of oligomeric amyloid-b or
by modulating microglia reactivity in AD brains. The finding suggests that the generation
of recombinant IL-34-based therapies could be a promising strategy for combating AD60.
Finally, in this study, we explored the potential utility of the PRS using the extended panel
of common genetic variants detected. We demonstrated how PRS modifies the risk and
onset of AD within APOE genotypes. The carriers of high-risk individuals into clinical
trials is relevant as APOE ε4. The risk modification by the joint effect of common variants
was most pronounced in APOE ε4 carriers, in whom there was a difference of up to 4
years in onset age between the low- and high-risk tiles of the PRS in APOE ε34 and a 4.5year difference in APOE ε44.
The added value of PRSs of common variants with small effects in terms of improved
discrimination between AD cases and controls was reported previously as
marginal22,26,61,62. Our study and others recently published24,26,27 showed, however, that
their effects are substantial for risk and age at onset. We show that the PRS could be
instrumental in clinical diagnosis for AD, the effect of the PRS was similar in men and
women, and there is risk differentiation at all ages of onset. This shows the wide
applicability and robustness of PRS. We did not observe that adding a sub-threshold
signal from GWAS improved the PRS, as had been previously suggested62. The
identification of subgroups at high genetic risk of AD with an earlier disease onset in the
general population has important implications for precision medicine. Pathological
changes related to AD begin to develop up to decades before the earliest clinical
symptoms63. Therefore, preventive interventions are increasingly introduced in the
subgroup of individuals with a high genetic risk at a younger age19,20 reducing the duration
of the trials and thus giving them the opportunity to access the most promising treatments
for high-risk individuals. In this context, APOE ε4 homozygotes carriers are considered
high risk, but as shown here the subjects with the highest PRS values and carrying one
copy of APOE ε4 have a similar risk (Figure 4B). This is relevant as this group represent
~1% of our control population, the same percentage as all APOE ε4 homozygotes.
However, further validation on the effect of proposed PRS in longitudinal series of
healthy and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) subjects, in context of other biomarkers
(e.g. imaging) are mandatory to determine the predictive utility of this paradigm. With
continued identification of culprit variants and additional risk loci, we anticipate that the
precision of PRS will be further enhanced64.
In sum, the current work reinforces the importance of increasing the sample size in future
meta-analyses to identify novel genetic associations with AD and refine known loci to
converge on the culprit variants. We described six novel associations with AD of common
alleles in or near the genes: APP, PLCG2, CHRNE, SHARPIN and PRKD3/NDUFAF7.
These signals reinforce that AD is complex disease in which amyloid processing and

immune response play key roles. We add to the growing body of evidence that polygenic
scores of all genetic loci to date, in combination with APOE genotypes, are robust tools
for predicting risk and age at onset of AD. These properties make PRS promising in
selecting individuals at risk in order to apply preventative strategies.
