Abstract

16

ADCC (antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity) is dependent on the varying capacity of

17

NK cells to kill, the affinities of FCGR3A-encoded CD16A receptors for antibody, and the

18

presence of antigen-specific antibodies. In vivo ADCC depends on the number of CD16A

19

receptor-positive NK cells in blood. We hypothesized that low ADCC cell function or low

20

effector cell numbers could be biomarkers or risk factors for myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic

21

fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). We measured NK cell ADCC lytic capacity and antibody

22

recognition, CD16Apositive NK cells/µl blood, and FCGR3A homozygosity for the F allele that

23

encodes low affinity CD16A antibody receptors. ME/CFS patients met the Fukuda 1994

24

diagnostic criteria. In this pilot report, we examined 5 families, each with 2 to 5 ME/CFS

25

patients, and compared 11 patients, 22 family members without ME/CFS, and 16 unrelated

26

healthy controls. ADCC was measured as CX1:1 cytotoxic capacity (the percentage of 51Cr-

27

Daudi tumors with obinutuzumab anti-CD20 antibody that were killed at a 1:1 ratio of

28

CD16Apos NKs to Daudis) and CX-slope. Individual CX1:1 capacities varied from 16.2% to

29

81.8% and were comparable between patients and unaffected family members, while the ADCC

30

of both family groups was lower than the unrelated healthy controls. The lack of difference

31

between patients and their unaffected family members indicates that low ADCC is unsuitable as

32

a diagnostic biomarker for ME/CFS. Familial CD16Apos NK blood cell counts were lower than

33

unrelated healthy controls. The potential for synergistic effects of combined low CX1:1 and low

34

effector cell counts occurring in the same individual was 24-fold greater for CFS family

35

members than for unrelated controls. FCGR3A of the families was predominantly F/F

Introduction

55

Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS) is an umbrella term, with ME

56

and CFS often used interchangeably, that is used to describe patients who meet the evidence-

57

based diagnostic criteria described by the National Academy of Medicine USA in 2015 [1]. The

58

National Academy suggested an alternate term, systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID) that

59

has yet to be incorporated into the scientific or popular literature. The medical condition lacks

60

unique diagnostic biomarkers and characterization of the underlying mechanisms of its

61

pathology. ME/CFS has common debilitating symptoms that affect as many as 800,000 to 2.5

62

million adults in the USA [1]. These symptoms include severe fatigue lasting more than six

63

months, long-lasting post-exertional malaise, un-refreshing sleep, ‘brain fog’ in the form of loss

64

of memory or lessened ability to think, chronic pain, and tender lymph nodes [2]. There are no

65

known causes for most cases; however, long-term ME/CFS-like pathology can follow severe

66

viral or bacterial infections [3]. ME/CFS is receiving increasing attention as a distinct disease

67

[4] and is viewed by some clinicians as being as devastating as HIV/AIDS [5]. ME/CFS is quite

68

costly to society [6]. Afflicted individuals would benefit from greater understanding of its

69

etiology and disease-promoting mechanisms and from discovery of definitive diagnostic

70

biomarkers. To the best of our knowledge, this pilot report is the first study since 1998 [7] that

71

compares biological functions of ME/CFS patients vs. their first degree family members in the

72

search for biomarkers. The inclusion of family members without ME/CFS as controls in the

73

present report resulted in the rapid identification of unsuitable diagnostic ADCC biomarkers

74

(which would have “passed” evaluation if comparisons were made only of patients vs. the

75

unrelated healthy controls).

76
77

Consideration of infectious and environmental etiologies (that could evoke ADCC) began when

78

the disease, which was originally termed as CFS, was first recognized in 1984 in a regional

79

cluster of patients [8]. Several viruses have been proposed to exacerbate CFS, including chronic

80

herpes viruses such as Epstein Barr virus [9-11], human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) [12], herpes

81

zoster [13], human herpes virus 6 (HHV6) [14-16], and parvovirus B19 [17, 18]. The fatigue of

82

CFS resembles the fatigue induced by gamma interferon during viral infections [19, 20].

83

Elevated gamma interferon is detectable in the blood of patients with severe CFS [21].

84

However, attempts to prove that viral infections are associated with most cases of CFS have been

85

generally unsuccessful [22, 23]. The potential for genetic predisposition to contribute to etiology

86

was first reported in 1998 by P.H. Levine et al. [7] for eight CFS patients within one family.

87

Monozygotic twins have reported concordance rates as high as 38% for a USA population of

88

female twins [24]. Other reports indicated lower concordance rates or little difference in

89

Swedish twins [25] and in a USA twin registry [26]. Attempts to identify a unique viral etiology

90

or detect unique gene expression in the CFS discordant monozygotic twin pairs [27] have been

91

unyielding to date. To date, both infectious causes and familial risks are unresolved issues in

92

CFS.

96

et al. observed in 1987 that CFS patients have low NK activity [28]. Studies followed that

97

reported low NK function (reviewed [29], also [30-33]), NK phenotypes consistent with lower

98

NK cell function (e.g., low perforin [34]; low granzyme B [33]; lower frequency of the more

99

cytotoxic CD56dim NK cells [35], and low ERK1/2 kinase [36]), and fewer blood NK cells in

100

patients during CFS disease episodes [37]. In contrast, a recent Scandinavian study with large

101

numbers of ME/CFS patients indicates that many CFS patients have normal NK activity and that

102

low NK activity is unsuitable as a biomarker for this disease [38]. Consequently, low NK cell

103

activities in ME/CFS must be viewed as far from universal.

104
105

We began this study with the idea that low ADCC mediated by NK cells could be a risk factor

106

for CFS, the term we use for identification of its patients. This ADCC is dependent on only

107

those NK cells that have CD16A receptors for antibodies and on the fraction of these CD16A-

108

positive NK cells that can kill. Even though the NK cells that mediate ADCC and natural

109

cytotoxicity use the same cytotoxic granule proteins, it is possible for natural cytotoxicity to be

110

compromised without affecting ADCC. For example, a rare mutation of the cytoplasmic region

111

of CD16A (where it binds to CD2) reduces natural cytotoxicity to K562 cells without affecting

112

antibody-recognition and ADCC [39, 40]. Also, variants of NK receptors [40] which are

113

involved in natural cytotoxicity (but unnecessary for ADCC) will affect the NK activity without

114

affecting ADCC. Thus, when natural cytotoxicity is reduced in CFS patients, ADCC could

115

remain unaltered and, when ADCC is affected, natural cytotoxicity could remain unaltered. We

116

hypothesized that ADCC risk factors for CFS might include: 1) reduced ADCC cellular

117

capacities, 2) decreased ADCC effector cell numbers and/or 3) requirement for more antibody to

118

support ADCC. Specifically, here we addressed: a) NK cell cytotoxic capacity for ADCC; b)

119

counts of blood NK cells with CD16A receptors; c) homozygosity for the FCGR3A allele that

120

encodes the IgG-Fc-receptor CD16A aa158 phenylalanine (F) that has lower affinity for IgG1

121

antibodies than aa158 valine (V) [41]; and d) the EC50 concentrations of antibody needed for

122

NK cells to recognize antibody-coated cells. The numbers of NK cells in blood are particularly

123

important because the NK cells in blood are responsible for most of human ADCC while most

124

tissue NK cells lack CD16A and ADCC [42, 43].

125
126

The study reported here has several novel features, including the ADCC measurements used for

127

comparisons and the inclusion of family members without ME/CFS as a second set of controls.

128

Two methods were developed for the study: an ADCC assay to detect cytotoxic capacity

129

independent of FCGR3A Fc-receptor genotypes [44] and TruCount® bead enumeration of

130

CD16A-positive(pos) blood NK cells. The ADCC assay uses a type 2 anti-CD20 monoclonal

131

antibody (obinutuzumab) to pretreat CD20pos B cell tumor ‘target’ cells, so that the normal B

132

cells within PBMCs are unable to serve as ADCC targets and assays can be made without the

133

cell losses associated with NK cell purification. The CD16Apos NK cells within unfractionated

134

PBMCs were quantified by flow cytometry (with TruCount® beads) to determine the effector to

135

target ratios in the ADCC 51Cr-release assays. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the

136

first to address ADCC functions in CFS patients compared to their family members. The report

137

focuses on members of five families, each with several CFS patients. Shared overall genetic

138

backgrounds and early environmental conditions could promote detection of specific alleles and

139

non-genetic adaptive changes in NK cells [45] that might affect CFS. Comparison of affected vs.

140

non-affected family members has the potential to identify rigorous diagnostic biomarkers.

141
142

We report five observations. (1) There was lower ADCC capacity by NK cells of CFS patients

143

compared to unrelated healthy controls. (2) There was no difference in ADCC between CFS

144

patients and their family members without CFS, clearly indicating that low ADCC is unsuitable

145

as a specific biomarker for CFS. (3) ADCC blood CD16Apos NK cell counts of CFS patients

146

and their family members without CFS were lower than the counts of unrelated healthy controls.

147

(4) CFS family members (with or without the disease) were much more likely to have a

148

combination of low ADCC activity with low CD16A NK cell counts than the unrelated healthy

149

controls. (5) The CFS families were predominantly homozygous CD16A F/F. On the basis of

150

these observations, we suggest that, while low cellular ADCC activity alone is definitely not a

151

biomarker of CFS, low ADCC may be a risk factor for CFS.

here simply as CFS because they were diagnosed by the Fukuda criteria during the period

159

between 1990 and 2010, before the terms ME or ME/CFS became common in the U.S.A.

160

Selection was for families each with several CFS patients and with multiple unaffected siblings.

161

The initial idea was to compare the incidence of CFS among CD16A F/F vs. V/V & V/F siblings,

162

with the hypothesis that the CFS incidence would be greater for the F/F siblings. (This

163

hypothesis remains untested as almost all family members of this study were F/F.) The five

164

families selected had a total of 13 CFS patients and three families had two generations with CFS

165

patients. The CFS patients met the Fukuda CDC 1994 diagnostic criteria for CFS [2]. Eleven of

166

the 13 CFS patients and 22 family members without CFS participated. The mean ages, sex, and

167

CD16A genotypes of the participating patients, their unaffected family members and the controls

168

are presented in Table 1. The ages, symptoms that qualify for the Fukuda criteria, and durations

169

of CFS disease of the patients are detailed in Table 2. Of the 11 CFS patients, 9 were female and

170

2 male, representative of the gender bias of CFS. The family pedigrees are illustrated in Fig 1;

171

participants in the study have their CD16A aa158 alleles within the symbols. Selection was

172

based on family members’ willingness to participate and their availability to donate blood on the

173

same day as did the patients. Additional information concerning ages, symptoms, duration of

174

disease, etc. of the patients may be obtained from Dr. Bateman upon request. Sixteen unrelated

175

healthy control donors who resided in Salt Lake City were matched by race, sex and age to the

176

patients. Healthy was defined as HIV-negative, without overt infections at the time of blood

177

donation, and without diagnosis of CFS. All blood donors, family and unrelated, were

178

Caucasian. Blood samples were coded in Salt Lake City. The ADCC, EC50 assays, blood

179

CD16A NK cell counts, and CD16A genotypes were run with the coded samples and decoded

Preparation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

199

Forty ml of blood was drawn from the subjects in Salt Lake City, between 8-10 AM and

200

distributed as follows; 8 ml into tubes for DNA extraction (PAXgene®, Qiagen, a BD company)

201

and the remainder 32 ml into heparinized tubes. Entire families, or groups of members of the

202

larger families, with inclusion of 1 or 2 unrelated healthy controls, were drawn on the same day.

203

The samples were coded and shipped overnight to Reno, NV. PBMCs from 24 ml of blood were

204

isolated at UNR by ficoll-hypaque density gradient centrifugation [46]. The PBMCs were

205

cultured overnight at 1-2 x 106 cells/ml in complete assay media, 90% Dulbecco' s complete

206

media containing high (4.5 g/L) glucose and L-glutamine (Corning), 10% fetal calf serum

207

(Atlanta Biologicals), 10 mM hepes (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO), and 1% penicillin-

208

streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich) to ensure ADCC activity [47]. Culture conditions and assay

209

media were standardized: one lot of fetal calf serum was frozen and used for all the experiments

210

and one lot of 75 mm tissue culture flasks (Biolite, Thermo Scientific) was used throughout the

211

experiments.

NK effector cells per µl PBMC solution

222

For the counts of the NK cells within the PBMCS, 50 µl aliquots of PBMCs were labeled with a

223

similar panel of antibodies, with the substitution of PE-Cy7 anti-CD33 (clone P67.6) for CD91

224

to detect monocytes and inclusion of FITC-anti-CD7 (clone CD7-6B7) and APC-Cy7 anti-CD56

225

(clone HCD56). The NK ADCC effector cells were CD3neg CD7posCD16pos

226

CD33negCD45pos and CD56variable. Inclusion of anti-CD7 was critical to detect

227

CD56negCD16AposCD7pos NK cells and to discriminate these NK cells [48] from the

228

CD56negCD16Apos monocytes (that are all CD7neg and largely CD33pos) [49].

229

Cytometry to detect NK effector cells

230

Cells were labeled for 30 minutes in tubes with TruCount® beads (Becton Dickenson no. 340334

231

[50]), fixed, and analyzed by flow cytometry the same day. The flow cytometer was a BD

232

Biosciences Special Order Research Product LSR II analytical flow cytometer with a high

233

throughput sampler (HTS) unit. Cellular analyses were gated with FlowJo software (FlowJo,

234

LLC, Ashland, OR) to determine the CD16Apos NK cells and TruCount® beads in order to

235

calculate the number of CD16Apos NK cells in the PBMC solutions [44]. See Fig 4B for the

236

cytometric gating.

ADCC assays

239

NK cell capacity and cooperativity

240

The assay measures ADCC calculated for 1:1 ratios of CD16Apos effector NK cells to antibody-

241

coated target cells [44] in order to compare donors with widely varied lytic capacities. It

242

measures the lytic activity of cells and is unaffected by CD16A V and F allelic differences. The

243

assay, which was developed for this study, has four critical features: 1) MHC class I-negative

244

Daudi target cells in order to avoid inter-donor variations caused by KIR inhibition after

245

engagement with MHC I proteins; 2) a type 2 anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody that is poorly

246

cleared from the membranes of B cells so that Daudi B cells could be pretreated with antibodies

247

and washed (thereby preventing the ADCC towards native B cells within the PBMCs that would

248

occur if unbound anti-CD20 antibody were present during the assays); 3) circumvention of NK

249

cell losses during isolation by using TruCount®s of the CD16A receptor-positive NK cells within

250

the PBMCs to determine the effector to target cell ratios; and 4) separate measurement of the

251

lytic slopes because the slopes of killing at multiple effector to target (E:T) ratios vary among

252

donors. The Daudi lymphoma target cell line [51] from the ATCC (Manassas, VA, catalog #

253

CCL-213) was maintained per ATCC instructions and routinely tested negative for mycoplasma.

254

Passages 10-80 were used as targets cells at 1 x 104 cells/well. The non-fucosylated anti-CD20

255

monoclonal antibody obinutuzumab (Gazyva®; also reported as GA101) [52-54] was obtained

256

from the Roche Innovation Center, Zurich, Switzerland. Daudi target cells were labeled with 0.5

257

mCi Na51CrO4 (Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA), then pretreated with antigen-saturating (1 µg/ml)

258

obinutuzumab antibody for 0.5 hour at room temperature, and washed 5 times to remove excess

antibody and unincorporated chromium. The PBMC effector cell solutions were diluted 2-fold

260

in quadruplicate in V-bottom plates (Costar 3894, 96 well) in 0.1 ml to create six CD16Apos NK

261

effector to target cell (E:T) ratios. Daudi cells (1 x 104 in 0.1 ml, with or without mAb

262

pretreatment) were added to each well, for ADCC or NK background activities, respectively.

263

Plates were centrifuged for 3 minutes at 1000 rpm and incubated for 4 hours at 5% CO2 and

264

37oC. After incubation, plates were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 1200 rpm and 0.1 ml of cell-

265

free supernatant was taken for analysis in a Packard Cobre II gamma counter. The percent

266

specific release (SR) was calculated using the formula

267

% SR = [(Experimental counts - Spontaneous Release)/(Max - Spontaneous Release)] x 100.

268

Spontaneous release was the leak rate of targets without PBMCs and the Max was the

269

radioactivity released by targets lysed with 1% SDS. CX1:1 cytotoxic capacity, the % of the

270

targets killed at a 1:1 ratio of effector CD16Apos NK cells to Daudi target cells (E:T), was

271

calculated as follows. Percent ADCC values for individual wells were plotted as y = % specific

272

51

273

linear % cytotoxicity vs. log10 E:T was used to calculate y = mx + b, with the lytic slope = m, and

274

b = the y intercept = the CX1:1 value (because for x = 0 the log10 E:T is 0 and 100 is 1). The P

275

values for linearity were <0.05, with R2 values >0.8 [44]. Lytic units (LUs) per 106 CD16Apos

276

NK cells were calculated [55] to provide reference to previous reports; however, for inter-donor

277

comparisons of LUs to be quantitative, the CX-slopes must be parallel and, in most cases, these

278

CX-slopes differed substantially among donors.

280

The EC50 effective concentrations of antibody needed for 50% of maximal ADCC [56] were

281

determined with a single concentration of PBMCs and 4-fold dilutions of obinutuzumab in the

282

assays. Final antibody concentrations ranged from 0.04 to 625 ng/ml. ADCC was determined at

283

4 hours, with duplicate or triplicate wells for each antibody concentration. The yields of PBMCs

284

after ficoll preparation were sufficient to support EC50 determinations for most, but not all,

285

donors.

The F/F, V/F and V/V genotypes of the receptor CD16A at aa158 were determined by PCR and

290

DNA sequence analysis at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research, Frederick,

291

MD, by Stephen K. Anderson, Ph.D. and additionally by flow cytometry. Amplicons specific for

292

the FCGR3A gene (which encodes CD16A) and that exclude the FCGR3B gene (which encodes

293

neutrophil CD16B) were generated with forward and reverse PCR primers, (5' to 3') for CD16

294

(TCCTACTTCTGCAGGGGGCTTGT) and (CCAACTCAACTTCCCAGTGTGATTG),

295

respectively. The amplicons were directly sequenced using Sanger methodology to determine

296

the genotypes [57].

The homozygous F/F genotype was also distinguished from V/F & V/V genotypes by flow

299

cytometry [44] using the MEM-154 clone of anti-CD16 mAb (PE-labeled, Pierce Chemical Co,

301

the 158 F [58], and also reacts with CD16B (that has only the valine form). An aliquot of the

302

PBMCs was labeled with the following antibody panel (for gating refer to the legend of

311

of family members, CFS patients and unrelated healthy controls in a single experiment with 4-6

320

http://www.sample-size.net/sample-size-proportions/ was used to determine the 95% confidence

limits for the F/F genotypes [calculation: “CI for Proportion”] and to estimate the minimal CFS

322

parental and control sample sizes [calculation: “Proportions—Sample Size”] required to apply

323

the observed F/F frequencies of this study to the design of a larger future study. For the quadrant

324

analyses to examine disease-promoting synergy when two variables coincided (in CFS patients

325

or CFS family members compared to healthy controls), variables were assessed with quadrants

326

delineated by their median values as the cutoffs for low and high values. The three variables

327

analyzed were CX1:1, CX-slope and CD16Apos NK cell counts per µl blood. Two quadrant

328

analyses were synergistic: comparison of CX1:1 & CD16A NK counts and CX-slope &

329

CD16Apos NK counts. Logistic regression using interaction terms was applied for the

330

synergistic comparisons. The results were expressed as the odds of being in the low-low

331

quadrant for CFS patients and family members vs. unrelated healthy control subjects. SAS

332

statistical software (SAS v. 9.2 Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for the quadrant

347

51

348

The CFS patients had lower ADCC capacity per effector cell than that of the unrelated healthy

349

controls. Their family members also had lower ADCC than the controls. ADCC was evaluated

350

using two measurements, CX1:1 and CX-slope. Both measurements are unaffected by CD16A

351

V and F allelic recognition of antibody due to the high amount of antibody bound to the Daudi

352

target cells and the high affinity of obinutuzumab antibody for both allelic forms of CD16A.

353

CX1:1 measures the percentage of ‘target’ cells that are killed at a 1:1 ratio of effector to target

354

cells (E:T) and reflects the fraction of CD16Areceptor positive NK cells that actually display

355

ADCC lytic capacity. (The remaining CD16Apos NK cells may still produce cytokines instead

356

of killing antibody-coated targets.) CX-slope indicates the increase in cells killed as the E:T

357

increases and reflects cellular cooperatively when several lymphocytes attack a single target cell.

Representative CX1:1 values and CX-slopes for a CFS patient and a healthy control are indicated

became evident that all the family members had lower ADCC compared to the unrelated healthy

386

and for all CFS family members compared to the unrelated healthy donors. CFS patients

387

and their family members without disease had similar CX1:1s, both of which were lower than the

388

unrelated healthy controls. The average CX1:1 values of CFS, healthy family, and unrelated

389

healthy donors was 39.5%, 47.8% and 59.7%, respectively. The average CX1:1 of all family

390

members was 45.1%, 77% of the CX1:1 of the unrelated healthy controls. The CX1:1 data are

patients and for all CFS family members compared to the unrelated healthy donors. CX-

A similar trend, of lower ADCC of both CFS patients and family members vs. unrelated healthy

controls, applied when lytic units were applied for qualitative reference to prior NK studies. The

402

substantial variations in the CX-slopes among donors obviated quantitative comparison of lytic

403

units which require parallel slopes [55]. For example, the lower CX-slope of the CFS patient in

404

Fig 2A resulted in a large lytic unit (requiring so many cells for 50% ADCC that the intersection

405

of the line of cytotoxicity with a y value of 50% ADCC is off the chart). The LU50

406

measurements of the CFS patients were lower compared to family members without CFS (means

407

98 +/- 195 vs. 149 +/- 170 LU50/106 ADCC NK effectors, respectively), and lower compared to

408

unrelated healthy controls (mean 187+/- 108 LU50/106 ADCC NK effectors). Consequently, due

409

to the increased variations, the P values were statistically insignificant (P = 0.55 for patients vs.

410

unrelated healthy controls). We provide the lytic unit calculations to indicate why separate

411

evaluations of CX1:1 and CX-slope are better suited for comparisons of ADCC.

412
413

With a disease like ME/CFS that could have several disease subtypes [60, 61], it is possible that

414

the low ADCC applied to only a few of the families and was sufficient to skew the averages for

415

all 5 families. Upon examination, when each family was considered separately, the family-

416

associated lower ADCC (compared to the unrelated healthy controls) applied to each one of the

417

five families (supplement Fig. 1A, 1B, 1C and 1D). The CX1:1 and CX-slopes were lowest for

418

419

each family, e.g., see family 28 in Figs S1A and S1B for CX1:1 and CX-slopes, respectively.

420

The conclusions from the overall mean values are consistent with the data for each separate

421

family.

422
423

It is critical for interpretation of the data that the ADCC of both the CFS patients and their

424

unaffected family members was lower than that of unrelated healthy controls. The CX1:1 of the

425

patients was 66% of the CX1:1 of healthy controls, while that of family members without CFS

426

was 82% of the controls. The CX-slopes of the patients was 71% of the controls, while the CX-

427

slopes of the family members without CFS was 78%. The difference between the CFS patients

428

vs. the unrelated healthy controls could have been misinterpreted as evidence for low ADCC as a

429

CFS biomarker. However, the ADCC of both CFS patients and their family members without

430

CFS was low and there were no statistically significant differences between them. For that

431

reason, inclusion of the family members in the study provided an extremely valuable perspective

432

to eliminate a false biomarker. The coincident observations of lower CX1:1 and lower CX-slope

433

are to be expected: a strong correlation between CX1:1 and CX-slopes applied to all blood

434

donors (supplement Fig 2).

435
436

ROC assessment of biomarker potential

437

ROC (receiver operating characteristic) plots indicate that low ADCC CX1:1 and low CX-slope

438

have limited potential as biomarkers specific for CFS, particularly when family members without

439

CFS are included as controls. ROC curves represent a means to simultaneously evaluate

440

sensitivity and specificity of a diagnostic test. By design, the areas under the ROC curves (AUC)

441

range from a theoretical perfect value of 1 (for a 100% reliable test for a diagnostic biomarker) to

442

0.5 which indicates no value as a biomarker. The CFS patients were the true positives for the

443

ROC analyses. For CX1:1, the AUCs comparing positive CFS patients with 3 negative groups

444

of either unrelated healthy controls, all donors without CFS (unrelated healthy and family

445

members without CFS, combined), or family members without CFS were 0.76, 0.72 and 0.69,

446

respectively (Fig 3A). For CX-slope, the AUCs comparing CFS patients with either unrelated

447

healthy controls, all donors without CFS, and family members without CFS were 0.77, 0.69 and

448

0.45, respectively (Fig 3B). For both ADCC measurements, the ROC analyses followed a

449

similar trend in which the AUC values for unrelated healthy donors were larger than the AUCs

for family members without CFS. For the unrelated healthy donors, P<0.05 significance applied

451

to the AUC analyses of the CX-slopes and was close to significant for the CX1:1 measurements

452

(Table 3). However, for both CX1:1 and CX-slopes there were no detectable differences in

453

AUCs between the CFS patients and their unaffected family members. Thus, the ROC

454

measurements indicate that ADCC capacity is an unsuitable biomarker for diagnosis of CFS,

455

particularly when applied to first degree relatives of CFS patients.

NK ADCC effector blood cell counts

468

CD16Apos NK blood cell counts (of the ADCC effector lymphocytes) were lower overall for

469

CFS patients vs. unrelated healthy controls but indistinguishable between CFS patients and their

470

family members without CFS. Average CD16Apos NK blood cell counts for the CFS patients

471

were lower (74% of control counts) than that of the unrelated healthy controls, though without

472

statistical significance (Fig 4A). The CD16Apos blood NK cell counts for the family members

473

without CFS were also lower, 78% of the controls. The cell counts of all family members

474

combined was 77% of that of the unrelated healthy controls (purple bars, Fig 4A) and was

475

statistically significant by one-tailed analysis, P <0.05. (In this case, the one-tailed assumption

476

was that the counts would be lower than the unrelated healthy controls). These CD16Apos NK

477

cell counts of patients and their family members without CFS were widely distributed (high and

478

low) within each family (supplement Fig 1C). Thus, the low CD16Apos NK cell counts varied

479

independently of CFS status. Three of four families evaluated (#10, 22, and 28) had low overall

480

CD16A counts while one family (#3) was similar to the unrelated healthy controls. The low

481

effector cell counts had the potential to further decrease ADCC resistance to viral infections in

482

most, but not all, of the CFS families. The antibody panel and flow cytometric gating for the NK

508

Synergistic risk of low ADCC lytic capacity and low effector cell

509

numbers

510

The combination of low in vitro ADCC capacity plus low ex vivo effector blood cell counts in

511

individual subjects represents a potential synergistic risk for low in vivo ADCC. If an individual

512

were to have low ADCC capacity per cell combined with fewer total ADCC effector cells in

513

their blood, this combination would result in low systemic ADCC capacity. This combination

514

was observed for CFS patients and their family members. First, before querying for combined

515

risks, we assessed if the ADCC cytotoxic capacity and the cell counts varied independently

516

among the donors. The CX1:1s and CX-slopes varied independently from CD16Apos NK

517

effector blood cell counts for all the donors; the R2 for linear fits were low (<0.1) and the P

518

values for linearity were insignificant. Therefore, evaluation for synergy is valid. Quadrant

519

analyses were applied to determine if the CFS patients and the CFS family members were over-

520

represented in the low-low quadrants for low CX1:1 combined with low blood effector cell

521

counts (or CX-slope combined with counts). The CFS patients and their family members were

522

24-fold more likely than unrelated healthy donors to be in the low-low quadrant for CX1:1 and

523

ADCC effector cell counts (Fig 5A, P = 0.02). The CFS patients and their family members were

524

also 12.5-fold more likely than unrelated healthy donors to be in the low-low quadrant for CX-

525

slope and ADCC effector counts (Fig 5B, P<0.05). Only one of the unrelated healthy control

526

donors (indicated by black symbols) was in a low-low quadrant, of Fig 5B. Overall, these two

527

quadrant analyses indicate synergistic familial risks for low in vivo ADCC.

531

comparing the relative distribution of CFS patients, family members and healthy controls by

quadrant analysis to determine if CFS family members were over-represented in the combined

533

the median values of CX1:1 (A) or CX-slope (B) vs. blood cell counts for the complete set of

536

ADCC values and the CD16Apos NK cell counts varied independently with P values for linear

correlation of 0.27 and 0.15, respectively, statistically non-significant, so that it is appropriate to

551

FCGR3A genetics

552

FCGR3A homozygous genotypes encoding CD16A aa158 F/F represent an additional risk factor

553

for low ADCC because the F/F NK cells require higher amounts of antibody to mediate ADCC

554

than NK cells homozygous or heterozygous with CD16A aa158 V. The CD16A-158F variant

555

has two-fold lower affinity for IgG1&3 than the 158V variant [41]. The F/F genotype is

556

associated with lower in vitro ADCC at low antibody concentrations than the F/V and V/V

557

genotypes [57, 62]. The frequency of the F/F genotype was 91% for the CFS patients and 82%

558

for the family members without CFS, while the unrelated healthy controls were 18.8% F/F

559

(Table 4 and pedigrees, Fig 1). The Utah population that includes the subjects of this study is of

560

non-Finnish northern European descent [63, 64]. The F/F frequency for such a European group

561

(with 919 sampled) is 41.9% [65]. Thus, the F/F frequencies of the CFS patients and family

562

members are higher than would be predicted while the F/F frequencies of the controls are lower

563

than would be predicted.

564
565

An initial response would be to compare all the family members with their genealogical group or

566

with the healthy controls of the study, but this comparison fails to consider that F/F by F/F

567

parents will produce only F/F offspring and that the number of these progeny is irrelevant. The

568

appropriate analysis is to first examine the pedigrees for F/F x F/F parental pairs (the first

569

generation) and use the F/F frequency of the 10 parents for statistical analyses. The appropriate

570

issue for this study is the significance of the F/F frequencies of these parents vs. the predicted F/F

571

incidence of the general population.

588

Two estimates (for the highest and lowest possible parental F/F frequencies) were used to

589

assess the potential statistical significance of the parental F/F homozygosity. The 7 available

590

parental genotypes are 5 F/F and 2 F/V. The other 3 of the 10 parents were deceased; their

591

genotypes, as either F/F or F/V, were determined from the genotypes inherited by their progeny.

592

(F/F progeny had to inherit an F allele from the deceased parent who had to have at least one F

593

allele, see pedigrees Fig 1.) The highest possible F/F parental frequency is 8 F/F & 2 F/V

594

parents (80% F/F) and is likely based on their 8 progeny who were all F/F, see Table 4, line 6.

595

The lowest estimate is 5 F/F & 5 F/V parents (50% total F/F); see Table 3, line 7. The high

596

estimate of 80% F/F parents was statistically significant compared to the 919 northern European

597

controls (P = 0.02) while the low estimate was insignificant (P = 0.42). These calculations are

598

based on all 5 families and, because of the uncertainty of the genotypes of the deceased, are only

599

indications of potential significance.

Sample sizes required for better assessment of CD16A F/F in CFS

602

To guide future researchers to address the risk of CD16A F/F homozygosity for CFS in other

603

geographic populations, we estimated the minimal sample sizes of CFS family parents and

604

controls needed to support F/F frequencies as a risk factor. We present a model scenario that

605

assumes an incidence of CD16A F/F homozygosity of 0.4096 based on the F allele frequency of

606

the northern Europeans, a prediction of 80% F/F CFS parental homozygosity associated with

607

CFS, and that the researcher will be able to amass a sample population with 4% of the donors

608

who are parents with a CFS child. The model includes consideration of type 2 statistical errors.

610

the CFS parental and control groups. Fourteen parents with 345 unrelated controls would be

611

needed for the 80% hypothetical F/F parental frequency, suggesting that examination of

612

additional populations would be feasible. A larger number (256) of parents would be required to

613

support 50% F/F parental frequencies with 6150 controls; these numbers are currently

614

impractical and underscore the problems associated with pilot clinical research studies (such as

615

this report) where limited sample sizes hamper interpretations [67, 68].

616
617

Recognition of antibodies bound to ADCC target cells

618

EC50s are the effective concentrations of antibody needed to support 50% of the maximal

619

ADCC that a fixed number of lymphocytes can mediate and indicate the ability of NK cells to

620

recognize antibody bound to target cells. EC50s are influenced by CD16A alleles. CD16A F/F

621

donors have only the lower affinity receptors for the Fc of IgG antibodies in contrast to F/V and

622

V/V donors with higher affinity V allele [56, 69]. CD16A F/F NK cells usually require higher

623

concentrations of antibody to support ADCC. High EC50s were required to support ADCC by

624

the CFS family members and represent an immune risk factor. The EC50s of the F/F CFS

625

patients and their F/F family members without CFS were similar, with average EC50s of 4.0 and

626

3.3 ng/ml obinutuzumab, respectively, much higher than the unrelated healthy control average

627

EC50 of 0.33 ng/ml (Fig 6, P<0.05). These EC50 differences are consistent with differences

628

between F/F CFS families and the control donors with V alleles. A potentially noteworthy

629

observation is that the EC50s values of the family members were bimodal and remarkably high

630

for some members. Without the unusually high values, the average EC50s for CFS patients or

631

their family members (0.8 & 0.9 ng/ml, respectively) were similar to the three unrelated healthy

F/F controls (0.6 ng/ml). As expected, these EC50s are still significantly higher than the

633

unrelated controls with V alleles. The previously reported higher antibody concentrations

634

needed to support ADCC by cells with CD16A F/F genotypes are consistent with the CD16A

F/F participants in this study. The ultimate significance to CFS is directly linked to the

genotypes.

642

used. The data are from families 3, 20 and 22. The CFS patients and their family members

643

without CFS who were homozygous F/F had EC50s that were higher than the EC50s of the

644

unrelated healthy controls (who had F/V & V/V genotypes). The EC50s of the CFS patients and

645

family members were bimodal; when values >3 ng/ml were excluded the EC50s were still

646

greater than the unrelated controls (P<0.05, not illustrated). The data are consistent with previous

647

reports that ADCC by NK cells from F/F donors requires higher concentrations of antibody than

648

from donors with the V allele. The numbers of F/F healthy controls (three) and F/V & V/V CFS

649

patients (three) were too low to support statistical comparisons of groups with common

650

genotypes; nonetheless, the average EC50s of CFS F/F family members (3.7 ng/ml) were higher

651

than the F/F unrelated controls (0.6 ng/ml, P= 0.25). Red symbols indicate CFS patients, blue

Discussion

657

Major findings

658

This pilot report presents four major findings. (1) ADCC of CFS patients was lower than that of

659

unrelated healthy controls but was similar to the ADCC of their family members without CFS.

660

The family members, both CFS patients and non-CFS, had ~75% of cytotoxic capacity compared

661

to the unrelated healthy controls. (2) The ADCC effector cell blood counts were lower for all

662

family members vs. unrelated healthy controls. (3) When low ADCC and low ADCC effector cell

663

numbers are considered as synergistic risks, there was a 12 fold or greater risk for CFS family

664

members. (4) Most members of the CFS-affected families had low affinity CD16A F/F antibody

665

receptors. Here we provide perspective for each finding, then discuss other immune parameters

666

that may affect the ADCC of the CFS patients, and make suggestions for future characterization

667

of ADCC in CFS disease.

668
669

Even though this pilot report involved only 11 CFS patients and 5 families, the similarity of

670

ADCC between CFS patients and their family members without CFS clearly indicates lack of

671

potential for low ADCC as a biomarker for CFS. The lower CX1:1 of CFS patients vs. unrelated

672

healthy controls could have been mistaken as CFS disease-associated; however, the similarity

673

between the patients and their family members without CFS indicated that CX1:1 lacks

674

specificity as a biomarker for CFS. The same similarity was found for the CX-slope

675

determinations. First degree family members, with common genetic backgrounds and common

676

environmental exposures, improve the chances that disease-specific genes or altered physiology

677

will stand out clearly. As a result, this study is deeply indebted to the many family members who

678

participated. The significant differences that are reported here between NK cell ADCC activities

679

of the CFS patients and unrelated controls and an absence of significant differences between the

680

patients and their unaffected family members were also noted in the first CFS family report of

681

NK activity by Dr. Paul Levine et al. [7]. The Levine study monitored antibody-independent NK

682

killing of K562 cells. They reported a lack of statistical difference in NK activities (P=0.38) for

683

8 family members with CFS compared to 12 unaffected family members. The pattern of lowest

684

NK cell activity of CFS patients, intermediate activity for first degree family members and

685

highest activity for unrelated controls was observed in the Levine report as well as for ADCC in

686

the current report.

687
688

Value of family members without disease for biomarker evaluation

689

Inclusion of family members without disease offers advantages for the screening of biomarkers

690

specific for diseases. Comparison of patients vs. family members without the specific disease

691

offers researchers the ability to “cut to the chase” in pilot studies. As shown in this study, the

692

family members provided an early warning for biomarker evaluation. The family members

693

without CFS had a much higher false positive rate as compared to the unrelated healthy control

694

subjects. Inclusion of family members can also identify disease-independent differences

695

between family members and the unrelated healthy controls, as we observed in this study. The

696

ROC analyses for CX1:1 and CX-slope provide strong support for separate assessments of an

697

unaffected family member control group as well as a group of unrelated healthy controls who are

698

matched with the patients for sex, age, and race. The ROCs indicate some potential for low

699

ADCC as a CFS biomarker for persons unrelated to CFS patients and unsuitability of low ADCC

700

as a test for CFS for persons who are first degree family members of CFS patients. Similar ROC

701

AUC values were reported for evaluation of (low) NK cell-mediated natural cytotoxicity to K562

702

cells as a biomarker for CFS patients when they were compared vs. unrelated healthy controls

703

[31]. For future studies, we highly recommend inclusion of family members without CFS as a

704

second control group.

705
706

Limitation of this report

707

This report has the limitations of only one race, donors from a single geographic location, and a

708

CFS patient population with moderate disease rather than extreme completely bed-ridden

709

disease. A study with the same race but a Scandinavian location, with 48 unrelated CFS patients,

710

came to the same conclusion as this report: ADCC is unsuitable as a biomarker for CFS [38].

711

The Scandinavian study used different methods to assay ADCC and, in contrast with this Utah-

712

based study, found no significant differences between CFS patients and controls. The two

713

different geographic locations (USA and Scandinavia) increase support for the unsuitability of

714

ADCC as a CFS biomarker. The effects of low ADCC in CFS for other races and in extreme

715

CFS disease are still unanswered.

717

ADCC as a risk factor in CFS

718

When low ADCC lytic capacity and low effector cells were considered as synergistic risk factors

719

predisposing for CFS, there was a greater risk for all the CFS family members. The reductions

720

affecting ADCC (cytotoxic capacity and numbers of ADCC effector cells) that were reported

721

here were modest and unlikely alone to cause disease. As observed with type 1A autoimmune

722

diabetes [70], multiple risk factors that are immunological in nature can predispose individuals to

723

diseases that may be triggered by infections.

724
725

The high incidence of the CD16A FCGR3A F/F genotype in the CFS families indicates that

726

genetics, as well as environmental factors such as viral infections, may contribute an additional

727

risk of CFS. The F/F incidence was strikingly high, but the small sample size of the parents (and

728

incomplete genotypes for three deceased parents) impacted the statistical analyses, leaving F/F

729

homozygosity as a CFS risk factor an unresolved issue. Since the F allele is common in the

730

human population, even if F/F status is a risk factor for CFS, it is likely that there are other

731

genetic risk factors. Twin studies, first published by Dr. Deborah Buchwald et al. [71], initiated

732

evidence for such genetic risks. Pair-wise concordance rates of CFS in monozygotic twins range

733

between 8%-38% in different reports, and are greater for monozygotic compared to dizygotic

734

twins and compared to other family members [25, 26, 71-74]. It is relevant to ADCC that pairs

735

of monozygotic twins (without CFS) have similar frequencies of CD16Apos NK cells and

736

CD16Apos NK subsets in contrast to the differences observed among unrelated individuals [75].

737

This twin study of NK cells also documented differences between pairs of monozygotic twins for

738

their NK cell subsets, indicating that non-genetic influences profoundly affect diverse NK

739

populations. Additional studies, both functional and genetic, of NK cell immunity in CFS

740

patients vs. family members without CFS, have the potential to reveal CFS-associated alterations

741

in immunity and to find disease-associated biomarkers.

742
743

The CFS patients may have critical combinations of immunological risks that can lead to poor

744

responses to a variety of infectious challenges. The cause(s) of CFS – genetic, viral, or other –

745

continue to confound the best of scientists [76]. If multiple risk genes are encoded on different

746

chromosomes, one would predict that, due to independent chromosomal segregation at meiosis, a

747

CFS patient could inherit a critical number of risk alleles, while their non-CFS siblings could

748

have some, but not the entire set, of risk alleles. This scenario could affect ADCC because

749

several genes other than FCGR3A affect ADCC activity. For example, inheritance of inhibitory

750

NK cell KIRs together with alleles of MHC class I proteins that bind the KIRs will reduce

751

ADCC [77]. Inheritance of G1m IgG allotypes with less affinity for CD16A will reduce ADCC

752

efficacy [78]. Homozygous lower affinity G1m17 antibody in combination with CD16A F/F NK

753

cells resulted in lower in vitro ADCC activity toward cells infected with the chronic virus Herpes

754

simplex 1 compared to G1m3/3 anti-viral antibody with CD16A V/V NK cells [79]. Antibody

755

fucosylation varies [80] and only non-fucosylated antibodies support ADCC [81]. The cytokine

756

TGFβ is elevated in patients with CFS [21], and TGFβ promotes loss of CD16A from NK cells

757

[82]. Regulatory factors, such as microRNAs that are elevated in the NK cells of CFS patients

758

[83], may influence ADCC. These examples indicate that many differences among people,

759

including hereditary differences, are candidates to affect ADCC and to be CFS risk factors in

760

addition to FCGR3A F/F homozygosity. Furthermore, the fatigue induced by chronic viruses

761

that are controlled by ADCC, such as after initial infection with Epstein Barr Virus to cause

762

mononucleosis, resembles symptoms of CFS [84]. Fatigue associated with viral infections

763

provides appeal for the hypothesis of compromised ADCC toward chronic viruses in the

764

pathogenesis in CFS. However, increased fatigue associated with post-exertional malaise occurs

765

without evidence for viral reactivation [85] and indicates just how difficult it is to establish links

766

between chronic infection and CFS disease. Recently, there has been interest in intestinal

767

infections in CFS [86] which, if conclusive, would indicate that previous researchers may have

768

had the right ideas and been looking in the wrong places.

769
770

Implications for future research

771

Continuation of research on ADCC in CFS presents opportunities to benefit the patients. It is

772

tempting to propose a mechanistic linkage in which low ADCC sub-optimally controls chronic

773

herpes viruses that could reactivate to promote the fatigue and neurological symptoms of CFS

774

patients -- even though viral etiology remains unproven. Comparison of CFS patients and their

775

family members without CFS may reveal additional genetic variants other than FCGR3A alleles

776

that may affect ADCC. Unfavorable IgG Gm1 allotypes, low levels of the IgG1 & IgG3

777

antibodies that support ADCC (reported for some CFS patients [87]), and high antibody

778

fucosylation may help explain why some CFS patients benefit from antibodies from unrelated

779

donors that are included within intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy [88-91].

780

Identification of those CFS patients with low CX1:1 capacities may indicate those patients most

781

likely to respond to immunomodulatory therapies such as poly(I:C) therapy [92, 93] that

782

promotes NK cell cytotoxic functions [94]. Discovery of the inflammatory sites of production of

783

TGFβ in CFS patients is important because localization of TGFβ to reservoirs of chronic viruses

784

may provide clues to key immune responses that are undetectable when blood is sampled. In

785

summary, this report adds support for a role for partial immunodeficiencies in CFS pathology.
