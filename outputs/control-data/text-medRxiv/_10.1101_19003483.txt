Abstract
Introduction: When paramedics are dispatched, it is expected that every patient receives the
same level of care regardless of variable factors. Homelessness is a growing social issue
across Canada that is particularly prevalent in urban areas. The quality of healthcare delivered
to individuals experiencing homelessness may be influenced by negative attitudes held by
healthcare professionals. There is an absence of literature quantifying the perspectives of
paramedics towards homelessness; therefore, the focus of this study was to identify the
attitudes of paramedic students towards homelessness and to continue the conversation in
regards to the evolving educational needs of paramedic students.
Methods: This study employed a longitudinal design of a convenience sample of first year
paramedic students in a college program in Ontario, Canada. The ‘Health Professional’s
Attitude Towards the Homeless Inventory’ (HPATHI) was distributed to participants before
and after placement and clinical exposure. The questionnaire includes 19 statements which
participants respond to on a Likert scale. Mean scores were calculated, and statements were
categorized into attitudes, interest, and confidence. Data were collected post-placement on
interactions with persons experiencing homelessness.
Results: A total of 52 first year paramedic students completed the HPATHI pre-placement
and 47 completed the questionnaire post-placement. Mean scores for attitudes (pre 3.64, SD
0.49; post 3.85, SD 0.38, p=0.032), interest (pre 3.91, SD 0.40; post 3.84, SD 0.39,p=0.51)
and confidence (pre 4.02, SD 0.50; post 3.71, SD 0.67, p=0.004) were largely positive, but
there was a demonstrated decreasing trend in confidence with, and interest in, working with
those experiencing homelessness. Participants reported an average of 60 hours of placement,
during which 15 participants (32%) reported interactions with people experiencing
homelessness.
Conclusion: First year paramedic students demonstrate overall positive attitudes towards
those experiencing homelessness, and the mean score for attitudes improved over the surveys.
However, there were demonstrable decreases in confidence and interest over time, which may
be related to the type and frequency of interactions during clinical placement. Paramedic
education programs may benefit from the inclusion of focused education on homelessness,
specific clinical experiences, and education related to social determinants of health.

Introduction
Homelessness is a pervasive social issue across Canada. It is particularly visible in urban
areas, and is a growing issue in many western countries. Over 235,000 Canadians experience
homelessness every year, while an estimated 150,000 access emergency shelters every year.
At least 35,000 Canadians are homeless on any given night, while approximately 50,000 are
part of the "hidden homeless" - provisionally accommodated by friends or relatives as they
have nowhere else to go (Gaetz et al. 2016). 9,200 people are homeless in Toronto on a given
night (City of Toronto 2018), with 7,530 in Ottawa, 1,519 in Winnipeg, 2,911 in Calgary
(Canadian Observatory on Homelessness 2019a), and recent figures identified over 2,200 are
homeless on any given night in Vancouver (Marshall 2019). This is not a problem that is
restricted to large urban centres however - smaller population centres, remote, and Northern
communities across Canada also report increasing levels of homelessness (Canadian
Observatory on Homelessness 2019a), and homelessness in these areas comes with its own
unique challenges that are poorly addressed in the literature.
Historically, individuals experiencing homelessness in Canada were older, single men.
However, homelessness today is much more diverse. Women, families and youth are
experiencing homelessness more than in the past (Gaetz et al. 2016). Almost 40,000 youth
experience homelessness in Canada, and between 25-40% of this population identify as
LGBTQS (Abramovich and Shelton 2017; The 519 2019). A significant proportion of
homeless persons are Indigenous (~16-24%), and the number of older adults and seniors
experiencing homeless is also growing (~25%) (Gaetz et al. 2016). These changing
demographic profiles also present new challenges when considering social services and
healthcare access for this population. For example, 1 in 3 transgender individuals are rejected
from shelters due to their gender identity or gender expression (Canadian Observatory on
Homelessness 2019b), while older adults who are experiencing homelessness are more likely
to have poorer health, and mental health issues (Kimbler et al. 2017).
Living homeless affects many individuals’ overall health and quality of life, including their
mental health and their ability to adequately manage chronic conditions (Frankish et al.
2005). Those experiencing homelessness have high rates of physical and mental illness, and
they have increased rates of morbidity and mortality when compared to the general
population (Frankish et al. 2005; Hwang and Bugeja 2000). Due to the difficulty in accessing
general healthcare and social services, many persons experiencing homelessness regularly
interact with paramedic services and emergency departments (ED) as their primary source of
healthcare (Goering et al. 2002; Moore et al. 2011; Padgett et al. 1995; Pearson et al. 2007).
Approximately 50% of those experiencing homelessness are affected by a wide range of
chronic medical issues, some of which include diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, arthritis, musculoskeletal disorders, and skin and foot problems (City of Toronto
2018). Management of such chronic medical issues while homeless is challenging (Hwang
and Bugeja 2000), and results in repeated access to healthcare services through emergency
access points such as paramedic services and EDs for chronic issues. This utilization of
healthcare services may be viewed as “inappropriate” and may subsequently lead to provider

prejudice. When those experiencing homelessness seek healthcare in such a manner, they
often report feelings of being “unwelcome” by healthcare workers (Wen et al. 2007). They
describe their experiences as dehumanizing and disempowering.
Existing literature suggests that healthcare professionals demonstrate overall negative
attitudes towards those experiencing homelessness and towards individuals of lower
socioeconomic status (Fine et al. 2013; Minick et al. 1998; Price et al. 1989; Sibley et al.
2017; Zrinyi and Balogh 2004). Negative experiences with paramedics described by homeless
shelter users were predominantly related to provider attitude (Leggio et al. 2019). These
experiences of prejudice and negative attitudes may act as a barrier to accessing healthcare in
the future (Lester and Bradley 2001; Parkinson 2009; Wen et al. 2007). By contrast, when
staff have a welcoming attitude, persons experiencing homelessness feel valued and part of
society (Wen et al. 2007). Positive experiences are not the only benefit of compassionate care.
In fact, when those experiencing homelessness in Toronto experienced compassionate care in
the ED, it resulted in a significant decrease in both the total number of return visits by 28%
(95% CI 14-40%, p=0.001), and the average frequency of visits per month by 33% (95% CI
29-44%, p<0.001) (Redelmeier et al. 1995). This result reflects an economic benefit for the
healthcare industry as well as a positive influence on patient care.
There is a distinct lack of literature that explores the intersection of paramedicine and
homelessness. In particular, the attitudes of paramedics towards persons experiencing
homelessness, their knowledge and understanding of health and social issues related to
homelessness, and the role that paramedics may be able to play in providing healthcare for
those experiencing homelessness remain poorly investigated and reported. Those
experiencing homelessness have previously indicated their trust in paramedics (Zakrison et
al. 2004), and anecdotally paramedics interact regularly with individuals experiencing
homelessness. Paramedics are therefore uniquely positioned to care for this population – they
are afforded the ability to assess the health and social needs of patients in context, and can
refer such individuals to a variety of alternative services and destinations outside of the ED as
appropriate (Moore et al. 2011; Tangherlini et al. 2016). Given the diversity of values, beliefs
and perspectives on homelessness (Frankish et al. 2005), it is important to identify if negative
attitudes exist among paramedics, as quality of care may otherwise be influenced. Therefore,
the purpose of this study is to investigate the attitudes of paramedic students towards
homelessness and to discuss potential opportunities within paramedic education to improve
healthcare delivery for those experiencing homelessness.
Methods
Terminology
We appreciate that there are differing views on the terminology used in relation to
homelessness. Throughout this manuscript we have elected to use the term “experiencing
homelessness”, as there are varying definitions of homelessness, and it can be chronic or
transient in nature (Rich 2017). Homelessness also affects different groups of people in
different ways, and every individual’s experience is unique (Canadian Observatory on
Homelessness 2019c).

Participants
This study was a longitudinal study of a convenience sample of first year paramedic students
in a two-year paramedic diploma program at [redacted for peer review] in Ontario, Canada.
All students were invited to participate in the study. Participants were provided with an
explanatory statement prior to participation, and were informed that participation was entirely
voluntary and responses were completely anonymous.
Ethical considerations
Ethics approval was granted by the Research Ethics Board at [redacted for peer-review]
(approval S 18-06-28-1).
Materials
This study utilized a paper-based questionnaire, the Health Professional’s Attitude Towards
the Homeless Inventory (HPATHI) (Buck et al. 2005), a 19-statement survey which
participants respond to on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to
strongly agree (5). The HPATHI instrument is a validated tool that has previously been used
in other healthcare professions (Crow 2014). It has not previously been tested in paramedic
students. We elected to use the HPATHI to allow for comparisons with existing literature in
other professions, and due to the ability to group responses into attitudes, interest, and
confidence (Fine et al. 2013).
Data collection
The questionnaire was distributed to participants on two occasions - the beginning of the first
semester before clinical placement experience, and at the beginning of the second semester
after clinical placement experience. No demographic data were collected. Responses were
entered into SPPS v.20 (IBM Corp., 2011) for collation and analysis.
Data analysis
Negatively worded statements in the HPATHI (statements 4, 5, 10 and 16) were reversescored so that for every survey item, a higher numerical score (towards 5) indicated a more
positive attitude towards homelessness. Statement 19 is excluded from analysis due to
irrelevance to paramedicine. Descriptive statistics (mean, SD) are used to describe trends in
the data and to discuss our results in the context of the existing literature, and t-tests were
used to compare means before and after clinical placement. All analyses were 2-tailed and
p<0.05 was considered significant.
Clinical placement setting
The majority of these students completed clinical placement experience in the area
surrounding the city of London. This city identified approximately 400 people experiencing
homelessness, with 30% identified as Indigenous (Canadian Observatory on Homelessness
2019a). 60% of those surveyed experienced chronic homelessness (experienced homelessness
for six months or more in the past year). The majority of respondents listed abuse or
relationship issues as the cause for their homelessness (City of London 2017a). A total of

43% reported chronic health issues, and 56% reported emergency shelters as the place they
slept most frequently. In the past five years, 10,782 people have stayed at homeless shelters
in this city. Of these, 66% were adult males, 21% were adult females, 11% were dependent
children and youth, and 2% did not report their gender. Individuals staying at shelters ranged
in age from 15 to 96, with an average age of 39. Young adult females (≤29 years of age)
comprised 42% of females accessing shelters. The average number of nights stayed increased
from 24 in 2011 to 41 in 2016, with males on average staying longer than females (City of
London 2017b). These statistics are reflective of the urban city of London and do not account
for those experiencing homelessness in surrounding rural centres.

Discussion
Our study demonstrated that first year paramedic students had overall positive attitudes
towards people experiencing homelessness, and the mean score for attitudes improved over
the surveys (p=0.032, see Table 2). However, there appeared to be a decreasing trend over
time in relation to confidence in working with (p=0.004), and interest in working with
(p=0.51) those experiencing homelessness (Table 2). Of note within the individual statements
was a statistically significant improvement in participants’ perceptions of the healthcare
needs of the underserved (statements 6 and 12, see Table 1). However, comfort levels (and
thereby confidence) demonstrated a statistically significant decline (statements 7, 9 and 10,
see Table 1). In addition, only 32% (n=15) of participants directly interacted with people
experiencing homelessness during their placement (Table 3).
Professional, non-judgmental, compassionate care toward homeless shelter users appeared to
best describe the difference between a positive experience from a negative one for the
individual when interacting with paramedics (Leggio et al. 2019). The positive attitude
towards those experiencing homelessness demonstrated by the participants in our study is
encouraging, and provides a foundation for continued compassionate care. The decline in
interest and confidence in working with people experiencing homelessness may have been
related to the type and frequency of interactions during clinical placement. One reason for
this decreasing trend could be a lack of formal education surrounding the health and social
needs of those experiencing homelessness. Indeed, social determinants of health in general
are poorly addressed in the curriculum at present. Given the growing recognition that social
and economic factors shape individuals’ health outcomes, it seems prudent that this should be

reconsidered in our approach to paramedic education (Artiga and Hinton 2018; Booske et al.
2010). Additional reasons may include elements of the hidden curriculum that are enacted
while undertaking clinical placements. Further exploration of the possible reasons for this
trend in our findings is warranted.
Previous literature conducted in other healthcare professions suggests that education, formal
training, and clinical exposure are important factors in changing the perceptions of healthcare
providers in relation to homelessness (DeLashmutt and Rankin 2005; Hunt 2007; Sibley et al.
2017; Stanley 2013). Clinical experience that involved working with persons experiencing
homelessness demonstrated positive changes in the attitudes of nursing students (DeLashmutt
and Rankin 2005). The low exposure of participants in our study to homelessness during
clinical placement suggests that additional opportunities for interaction with people
experiencing homelessness could be considered for integration into the curriculum in order to
change perceptions. However, exposure alone may not change perceptions towards
homelessness over time (Sibley et al. 2017) - formal education in equality and diversity may
also be required to improve knowledge and attitudes when caring for those experiencing
homelessness (Jezewski 1995).
There likely exists a need for both formal education and simulated scenarios in paramedic
education to facilitate the development of cognitive and affective skills, and the confidence
required when caring for this patient population (Leggio and Miller 2017). With appropriate
education and experience, paramedics could potentially begin to play a more involved role in
the health and social care needs of people experiencing homelessness. For example, they may
be well positioned to provide patient education and resources related to access to nutritious
meals, personal hygiene issues, healthcare services, and first aid measures. They may be able
to provide support in the form of social interventions such as taxi and food vouchers (Bridge
2019). Further insight into the role that paramedics can play in the health and social care of
those experiencing homelessness will be best informed through directly involving both of
these groups in future research. Paramedics also need to consider their role in the public
health and public policy discourse related to social issues such as homelessness. For example,
strategic plans to address homelessness or its associated health issues rarely include
paramedic services. This is perhaps related to a view of paramedics as emergency responders
rather than as healthcare professionals integrated within the health service.
Future studies should aim to enrol larger samples, study practicing paramedics, involve those
experiencing homelessness, and consider expanded approaches to data collection. In addition,
paramedics need to consider their involvement in policy discussions related to homelessness
and broader social issues that have an impact on health. It is our hope that this pilot study
encourages an interest in further research in this area of paramedicine.
Limitations
The use of convenience sampling at a single site, although a simpler recruitment method,
means that results may not be representative of paramedic students across our program, or the
province. The small sample size means that results may not be generalizable. There are no

data on those students who declined to participate. The HPATHI is a self-reported
questionnaire that while providing reliable data, does not account for participants’ selfreporting bias. There may be variances in what participants reported, and how they actually
conduct themselves in practice. Social desirability bias could have an important effect on
results however we attempted to minimize it through an anonymous survey. While the
HPATHI was a convenient way to collect our data, the questionnaire itself does not include
any statements directly related to paramedic practice. There was a loss of five participants
between pre-placement and post-placement questionnaires, and due to our decision to not
collect demographic data, we are unable to determine who these participants were.
Conclusion
The goal of conducting this study was to determine paramedic students’ attitudes towards
homelessness in order to suggest improvements in paramedic education and patient care. Our
study demonstrated that paramedic students had overall positive attitudes towards people
experiencing homelessness, which is encouraging and is the foundation for positive
interactions and improved patient outcomes in the future. However, there appeared to be a
decreasing trend over time in relation to confidence and interest in working with persons
experiencing homelessness. Implementation of curriculum changes could improve paramedic
students’ perceptions of caring for patients in this vulnerable population. Further research
should be considered into the role paramedics can play in addressing the healthcare and social
needs of persons experiencing homelessness.
