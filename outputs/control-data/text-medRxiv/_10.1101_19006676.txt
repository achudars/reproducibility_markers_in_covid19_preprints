ABSTRACT
Objective: We previously found temporoparietal “Alzheimer-typical” atrophy in patients with
the behavioral variant of Alzheimer’s disease (bvAD) with relative sparing of frontal regions.
Here, we aimed to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms of bvAD based on alternative
neuroimaging markers.
Methods: We retrospectively included 150 participants at the University of California San
Francisco and University of Berkeley, including 29 bvAD, 28 “typical” amnestic-predominant
AD (tAD), 28 behavioral variant of frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and 65 cognitively
normal participants. Patients with bvAD were compared with other groups on glucose
metabolism and metabolic connectivity on [18F]FDG-PET, and subcortical gray matter volumes
and white matter hyperintensity volumes (WMHV) on MRI. A receiver-operatingcharacteristic-analysis was performed to determine the measures yielding the highest contrast
between groups.
Results: bvAD and tAD showed predominant temporoparietal hypometabolism compared to
controls, and did not differ in direct contrasts. However, overlaying statistical maps from
contrasts between patients and controls revealed broader frontoinsular hypometabolism in
bvAD compared to tAD, partially overlapping with bvFTD. Metabolic connectivity analyses
indicated greater anterior default mode network (DMN) involvement in bvAD compared to
tAD, mimicking bvFTD. Analyses of subcortical volume and WMHV showed no relevant
group differences. The top-3 discriminative measures for bvAD vs. bvFTD were: metabolism
in posterior (bvAD<bvFTD), anterior DMN (bvAD>bvFTD) and parietal cortex
(bvAD<bvFTD; AUC: 0.80-0.91, p<0.01), while the top-3 discriminators for bvAD vs. tAD
were amygdalar volume (bvAD>tAD), anterior DMN (bvAD<tAD) and salience network
metabolism (bvAD<tAD; AUC: 0.66-0.75, p<0.05).

INTRODUCTION
Individuals with the behavioral variant of Alzheimer’s disease (bvAD) present early and
prominent behavioral and personality changes, with AD as the primary etiology1. Case reports
and small sample studies have suggested prominent frontal atrophy and pathology in bvAD
patients2-5. The largest neuroimaging study to date in clinically defined bvAD patients revealed
a prominent temporoparietal atrophy pattern with a relative lack of frontal atrophy1, questioning
the neurobiological basis of the prominent behavioral deficits. The behavioral phenotype in
these individuals might be explained better by complementary neuroimaging techniques. For
example, functional measures such as glucose hypometabolic patterns or alterations in
metabolic connectivity may be more sensitive than structural MRI6 and allow the assessment
of large-scale networks rather than sole investigation of localized associations7. Furthermore,
structural measures such as subcortical atrophy or white matter damage affecting
frontosubcortical tracts have consistently been associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms8, 9.
Exploring these neuroimaging features will enhance our neurobiological understanding of the
prominently behavioral phenotype in bvAD. In addition, it may aid the often challenging
differential diagnosis of bvAD versus ‘typical’ AD or the behavioral variant of frontotemporal
dementia (bvFTD)5,

10

, and potentially lead to more accurate diagnoses and patient

management. We had two study objectives: (i) to increase our understanding of the relative lack
of frontal atrophy in patients with the behavioral variant of AD through the assessment of
multiple neuroimaging markers, and (ii) to identify the diagnostic accuracy of several
neuroimaging, neuropsychological and neuropsychiatric measures in the differential diagnosis
of bvAD vs. typical AD and bvFTD.

METHODS
Participants
We selected 29 bvAD patients from the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) AD
Research Center (San Francisco, USA) who were included in our previous report on bvAD1,
and had available structural MRI, FLAIR or FDG-PET neuroimaging measures. In the absence
of consensus clinical criteria for the behavioral variant of AD, patients with bvAD were defined
retrospectively by a group of behavioural neurologists (G.D.R., Y.A.L.P., P.S.) and
neuropsychologists (R.O., J.H.K.) as patients with a diagnosis of bvFTD or “frontal variant
AD” or a differential diagnosis of bvFTD vs. AD who had biomarker evidence for and/or
autopsy confirmation of AD pathology1. Data availability differed per modality, as FDG-PET
(n=19) and FLAIR data (n=15) were only available in a subset (see Table 1 for characteristics
of the group with MRI data available and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 for characteristics
of the FDG-PET and FLAIR subsets). Patients with bvAD were matched with 28 tAD patients
and 28 bvFTD patients, also described in the original study1. tAD patients fulfilled criteria for
probable AD with at least an intermediate-likelihood of AD pathophysiology according to the
National Institute on Ageing-Alzheimer’s Association criteria11 or mild cognitive impairment
due to AD12 based on positive amyloid biomarkers and/or autopsy. bvFTD patients met the
clinical criteria proposed by Neary and colleagues13 or Rascovsky and colleagues14, and had
negative amyloid biomarkers and/or autopsy confirmation. Patients with significant
cerebrovascular disease were excluded from the UCSF Aging and Dementia Research Cohort.
Finally, we selected two cognitively normal control groups. The first group underwent MRI on
the same scanners as the patient groups at UCSF, but had no FDG-PET data available (CN1,
n=34). The second group underwent FDG-PET on the same scanners as the patient groups at
the University of California Berkeley (CN2, n=31), but had MRI on a different scanner than the

patient groups. Both CN groups had cognitive test scores within the normal range and absence
of neurological or psychiatric illness15.

Investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms in bvAD
Glucose hypometabolism
FDG-PET images were obtained at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL) using a
Siemens ECAT EXACT HR PET (nbvAD=15) or Biograph PET/CT (nbvAD=4) scanner.
Acquisition parameters have been specified elsewhere16. Starting 30 min post-injection of 5-10
mCi of [18F] Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG), 6 x 5 minutes frames of emission data were collected.
All PET data were reconstructed using an ordered subset expectation maximization algorithm
with weighted attenuation. Images were smoothed with a 4 × 4 × 4-mm Gaussian kernel with
scatter correction. FDG-PET frames of 30-60 minutes post-injection aligned to the first frame
and averaged. Next, each frame was realigned to the resultant mean image. These native space
images were summed and standardized uptake value ratios (SUVr) were calculated by
normalizing the summed FDG images to the mean activity in the pons, as glucose metabolism
in this region has been shown to be preserved in AD17. A mutual information affine registration
was used to coregister these normalized FDG-PET images to the corresponding MR image in
native space. For the cognitively normal group with FDG-PET scans available (CN1), MRI
scans were obtained on a 1.5T Magnetom Avanto System scanner (Siemens Inc., Iselin, NJ) at

the University of Berkeley, with a 12-channel head coil run in triple mode. These images were
used for PET processing only. Subsequently, the MRI images were registered to Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) space and the FDG-PET images were then also transformed to
MNI space using the individual deformation fields obtained from the coregistered MRI
normalization. The normalized FDG-PET images were then smoothed using a 12-mm Gaussian
kernel18. All images were visually inspected and deemed suitable for further analyses. Then,
voxel-wise comparisons of FDG-SUVr images were performed in SPM12 (Welcome Trust
Center for Neuroimaging, University College London, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm), using an
analysis of covariance model that included age and sex as covariates. Pairwise contrasts were
performed among the four groups (i.e. bvAD, tAD, bvFTD and CN1), which yields T-maps
signifying the difference in SUVr for each voxel. For comparisons between patients and
controls, we thresholded T-maps at p<0.05, family-wise error corrected at the voxel level, and
an extent threshold of k=50 voxels. For contrasts between patient groups we applied an
uncorrected threshold of p<0.001 and extent threshold of k=50 voxels due to smaller expected
differences between groups. This yields binary maps of significant voxels for each comparison
and we overlaid these maps for patients vs. control contrasts on an MNI brain template to
visualize regional differences and overlap between groups.
Metabolic connectivity
Resting-state metabolic connectivity was examined in all groups using a voxel-wise
interregional correlation analysis (IRCA) of FDG-PET data19. This method involved several
steps20; i) selection of relevant networks, ii) definition of seed regions-of-interest (ROI) within
key regions in these functional networks as described in previous literature, iii) generation of
covariance maps by correlating the mean FDG-SUVr in the seed ROI with the mean FDGSUVr in all voxels across the brain, and iv) comparing these covariance maps to functional
network templates and calculating goodness-of-fit (GOF) scores for each network. For step (i),

we selected networks from the literature that are thought to play a pivotal role in bvFTD and
tAD21, including the default mode network (DMN)22, salience network (SN)23 and executive
control network (ECN)24. To study the specific contribution of posterior vs. anterior DMN, the
DMN was fractioned into anterior and posterior subsystems in accordance with previous
studies25-27. For step (ii), the left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC, MNI coordinates: x=-8, y=56, z=2625) was selected as the seed region for the posterior DMN, the left anterior medial
prefrontal cortex (amPFC, x=6, y=52, z=-225) for the anterior DMN, the right frontoinsula (riFI,
x=36, y=18, z=428) for the SN, and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (riDLPFC, x=44,
y=36, z=2024) for the ECN. Spheres of 4mm were drawn around the abovementioned
coordinates and, for each subject, mean FDG SUVr values were extracted from each of these
spheres using Marsbar while using a gray matter mask to exclude PET counts from white matter
and cerebrospinal fluid. For step iii), multiple linear regressions were performed in SPM12 to
assess correlations between FDG uptake in each seed ROI and FDG uptake across the brain,
resulting in interregional covariance maps. As the PET covariance analyses explored
correlations between the seed region and each voxel across subjects, one interregional
correlation map was obtained per group. The interpretation of these maps is based on the notion
that regions covarying in levels of metabolism are associated to each other. Separate models
were used for each group, resulting in five interregional covariance maps per group. These
analyses were adjusted for age and sex. For step iv) the goodness-of-fit of the interregional
covariance maps with standard functional network templates, published by the Stanford
Functional Imaging in Neuropsychiatric Disorders Lab29 was assessed. As previously
described29, these standard functional network templates were created by applying FSL’s
MELODIC independent component analysis software to resting state fMRI data of 15 healthy
control subjects. The network templates were downloaded as binary ROIs from
http://findlab.stanford.edu/functional_ROIs.html. Goodness-of-fit was assessed by calculating

the difference between the mean T-score of all voxels of the interregional covariance map
(transformed SPM T-maps) inside the functional network template (Tinside) and the mean Tvalue of all voxels outside the functional network template (Toutside), i.e. goodness-of-fit = Tinside
– Toutside30. A high goodness-of-fit score indicated a high correspondence of the pattern of
correlated regions based on similar FDG uptake with certain network architecture. Due to the
group-level nature of these analyses, no statistics were performed on the GOF scores. In order
to test the robustness of the goodness-of-fit between the covariance maps and the functional
network templates, these analyses were repeated with an independent set of network templates
from functional MRI data from 1000 healthy subjects as part of the Neurosynth project
(http://neurosynth.org31). The templates were obtained by entering the MNI coordinates and
downloading the generated functional networks. The templates were thresholded at a default
threshold of r=0.2 using FSL to create binary masks.
Subcortical atrophy
We compared bvAD patients with tAD, bvFTD and CN groups on gray matter volumes of
several subcortical structures, including the amygdala, nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus
putamen, globus pallidus, hippocampus and thalamus. Volumes were extracted from T1weighted MR scans, obtained at the University of California San Francisco, either on a 1.5T
(Magnetom Avanto System/Magnetom VISION system, Siemens, Erlingen, Germany,
nbvAD=17) or 3T (Tim Trio, Siemens, Erlingen, Germany, nbvAD=12) all with a standard 12channel head matrix coil. Acquisition parameters have been published previously20. Subcortical
parcellations were performed using FSL FIRST32. First, the T1 images were transformed to
MNI space using affine registration, and a subcortical mask was applied to the images. Next,
subcortical structures were segmented bilaterally based on shape models and voxel intensities.
All images were inspected visually after registration and segmentation. For each subcortical
structure, left and right absolute volumes were generated, calculated in cm3, and grouped

together in the analysis, as there were no volume differences based on laterality. Statistical
differences in volumes between groups were assessed using a general linear model, including
all subcortical structures, with age, sex, scanner field strength and total intracranial volume,
which was obtain by summing the gray matter, white matter and CSF volumes after
segmentation in SPM1233, as covariates. Significant group differences were indicated by
p<0.05, Bonferroni corrected.
White matter hyperintensity volumes
Next, we compared bvAD patients with tAD, bvFTD and CN groups on white matter
hyperintensity volumes (WMHV), using a Bayesian Model Selection (BaMoS) algorithm on
FLAIR MR images34,

35

. Briefly, this method is a hierarchical, fully unsupervised model

selection framework based on a Gaussian mixture model for neuroimaging data which enables
the distinction between different types of abnormal image patterns without a priori knowledge,
accounting for observation outliers and incorporating anatomical priors. Lesion volumes were
calculated for four equidistant concentrical regions of white matter between the ventricles and
cortices per lobe bilaterally36. All FLAIR images were visually inspected prior to their inclusion
in the algorithm and those with significant motion or reconstruction artifacts were excluded.
The WMHV segmentation was checked for quality and images with evident over- or
underestimation were re-analyzed with an adjusted algorithm until satisfactory segmentation
was obtained. Regional WMHV were normalized to the population of cognitively normal
subjects, and statistical differences in WMHV between groups were assessed using a
generalized linear model with gamma probability distribution and log link, adjusting for age,
sex, scanner field strength and total intracranial volume. Significant group differences were
indicated by p<0.05 and no correction for multiple comparisons was used due to the large
correlation between dependent variables.

Investigating the diagnostic accuracy of multiple neuroimaging markers for
differentiating bvAD from tAD and bvFTD
To aid clinical differential diagnosis, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were
performed to examine the area-under-the-curve (AUC) for discriminating bvAD from tAD and
bvFTD. As input for the AUC analysis we used various neuroimaging measures investigated in
aim 1: measures of glucose metabolism, metabolic connectivity, subcortical atrophy and white
matter hyperintensities. For glucose metabolism, we extracted SUVr values from two ADsignature ROIs (i.e. temporoparietal cortex37 and a total parietal ROI based on the Automated
Anatomical Labeling (AAL) atlas regions38) and one FTD-signature ROI (comprising the
anterior cingulate, frontoinsular, striatal and frontopolar AAL atlas regions39, 40). In order to
create individual measures of metabolic connectivity, we extracted mean SUVr values within
the functional network templates as provided by Shirer et al. (2012) and divided them by the
SUVr values outside the network templates (SUVrwithin

network/SUVroutside network),

thereby

creating individual goodness-of-fit ratios based on SUVr values. For the subcortical structures,
only the amygdala was added to the AUC analysis based on assessment of differences in
subcortical volumes between diagnostic groups. For white matter hyperintensity volumes, total
WMHV were included, without correction for total intracranial volume. Since we were
interested in how the aim 1 neuroimaging measures related to structural MRI measures, we
additionally used relevant structural MRI as input for the ROC analyses. We extracted gray
matter volumes from the same AD-signature and FTD-signature ROIs as used for glucose
metabolism analyses. Pairwise ROC analyses between all groups were performed separately
for all measures, as the sizes of the groups per modality varied. We present the top-5 best
discriminatory variables in the main text, and provide an overview of all results in
Supplementary Table S7. In a sensitivity analysis, the ROC analyses were repeated including
only patients that had both FDG-PET and MRI available.

RESULTS
Demographic characteristics
The patient groups did not differ in age, sex and MMSE (Table 1). The level of education was
higher in the cognitively normal group compared to each of the three patient groups (p<0.01),
while there were no differences between the patient groups. The proportion of APOEε4 positive
patients was higher in the bvAD and tAD groups compared to cognitively normal controls
(p<0.01) and bvFTD patients (p<0.001). Cognitive and NPI scores are presented in Table 1.
There were no substantial differences in demographic characteristics between the different
subsets of patients that had FDG-PET, MRI or FLAIR available (see Supplementary Tables S1
and S2).

Investigating the pathophysiological mechanisms in bvAD
Glucose hypometabolism
Compared to cognitively normal controls, marked hypometabolism was found in the posterior
cingulate, precuneus and lateral temporoparietal regions in both bvAD and tAD, while bvFTD
displayed hypometabolism mainly in frontal regions and the temporal poles (Figure 1A&B). In
direct patient group contrasts, bvAD showed no differences in glucose metabolism with tAD
and less frontal hypometabolism than bvFTD (p<0.001, uncorrected, see Figure S1 for spatial
patterns of patient vs. patient contrasts). Visual assessment of the overlay of T-maps resulting
from voxel-wise comparisons between patients and cognitively normal controls suggested
broader frontoinsular involvement in bvAD than in tAD, comprising the right lateral frontal
lobe and bilateral insulae (Figure 1C).
Metabolic connectivity
bvAD patients showed a higher GOF score in the anterior DMN than tAD patients (GOF=4.13
versus 2.92, respectively), which was identical to the bvFTD GOF score (4.13). The GOF score

for bvAD (3.85) in the posterior DMN was intermediate between bvFTD (2.04) and tAD (4.14),
but closer to tAD. In the salience network, bvFTD had a higher GOF score (2.90) than both
tAD (0.62) and bvAD (1.05). In the executive control network, bvAD patients (2.20) showed a
lower GOF score than tAD (3.11) and bvFTD (2.78) patients (Figure 2 & Supplementary Table
S4). Sensitivity analyses using different functional network templates showed a similar pattern
of GOF scores (see Supplementary Table S4 & Figure S2).
Subcortical atrophy
Compared to cognitively normal controls, bvAD showed lower gray matter volumes in the
hippocampus, putamen, caudate nucleus and thalamus, and no significant differences in the
amygdala, nucleus accumbens and globus pallidus, while tAD patients showed lower volumes
in the hippocampus, amygdala, nucleus accumbens and thalamus and bvFTD patients showed
lower volumes in all subcortical structures compared to cognitively normal controls. bvAD
showed larger amygdala gray matter volume than tAD (p<0.05) and no differences with tAD
in all other examined structures. In comparison with bvFTD, bvAD and tAD patients showed
larger globus pallidus gray matter volumes (p<0.05), tAD patients showed larger nucleus
accumbens gray matter volumes (p<0.05), and no differences with bvAD were found in other
structures (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S5).
White matter hyperintensities
No differences were found between the patient groups in total WMHV, nor were regional
differences found in WMHV between the patient groups (all p>0.05, Supplementary Table S6).
Subregional analysis revealed lower frontal juxtacortical WMHV in bvAD than bvFTD, as well
as lower left temporal juxtacortical WMHV, and higher right temporal juxtacortical WMHV in
bvAD than bvFTD (p<0.05, Figure 4). In comparison to tAD, bvAD patients showed lower
juxtacortical left temporal and subcortical WMHV and higher right temporal juxtacortical
WMHV (p<0.05, Figure 4).

Investigating the diagnostic accuracy of multiple neuroimaging for differentiating bvAD
from tAD and bvFTD
The top-5 discriminative variables for bvAD vs. bvFTD were posterior DMN (bvAD < bvFTD;
AUC=0.91, 95%CI= 0.80-1.00) and anterior DMN (bvAD > bvFTD; AUC=0.83, 95%CI=0.700.97) metabolism, parietal metabolism (bvAD < bvFTD; AUC=0.80, 95%CI=0.65-0.94),
salience network metabolism (bvAD > bvFTD; AUC=0.76, 95%CI=0.60-0.92), and
temporoparietal metabolism (bvAD < bvFTD; AUC=0.75, 95%CI=0.58-0.91; Figure 5 & Table
S8). bvAD was discriminated best from tAD by amygdala gray matter volume (bvAD > tAD;
AUC=0.75, 95%CI=0.62-0.88), anterior DMN metabolism (bvAD < tAD; AUC=0.71,
95%CI=0.54-0.89), salience network metabolism (bvAD < tAD; AUC=0.66, 95%CI=0.490.84), FTD-signature region metabolism (bvAD < tAD; AUC=0.65, 95%CI=0.46-0.83) and
FTD signature region gray matter volume (bvAD < tAD; AUC=0.61, 95%CI=0.46-0.76). The
top-5 discriminative variables for bvAD vs. CN were temporoparietal hypometabolism
(AUC=0.93, 95%CI=0.86-1.00), parietal hypometabolism (AUC=0.91, 95%CI=0.83-1.00),
temporoparietal atrophy (AUC=0.91, 95%CI=0.83-0.99), hypometabolism in the posterior
DMN (AUC=0.90, 95%CI=0.79-1.00) and parietal atrophy (AUC=0.89, 95%CI=0.79-0.99). A
summary of all measures is included in Supplementary Table S7. Repeating the analyses with
individuals having both MRI and FDG-PET data available showed similar results (see

DISCUSSION
The aims of the current study were (i) to explore the clinico-anatomical dissociation observed
in bvAD (i.e. relative lack of frontal atrophy with prominent behavioral changes1) through
assessment of multiple imaging markers and (ii) to examine the diagnostic accuracy of several
neuroimaging, neuropsychological and clinical measures for differentiating bvAD from tAD
and bvFTD. We hypothesized that bvAD patients would exhibit more anterior hypometabolism,
more pronounced disintegration of metabolic connectivity networks involved in behavioral
processes, greater subcortical atrophy and a greater white matter hyperintensity burden in
regions impacting frontosubcortical tracts compared to tAD, and would partly resemble the
neuroimaging characteristics of bvFTD. Our results suggest that the behavioral symptoms
presented by bvAD patients are associated with subtle frontoinsular hypometabolism and
increased anterior default mode involvement. In addition, our results suggest that subcortical
atrophy and white matter hyperintensities do not contribute substantially to the clinical
phenotype of bvAD. The ROC analysis reinforces the idea that the differentiation of bvAD
from tAD and bvFTD lies in functional imaging rather than structural markers.
The pattern of hypometabolism in bvAD points towards subtle loss of neural activity in
frontoinsular regions in addition to posterior “AD-typical” regions. This represents a variantspecific pattern of hypometabolism in addition to a common involvement of temporoparietal
cortex across amnestic and non-amnestic variants of AD20, 41, 42. This suggests that either the
disease epicenter may differ between these AD variants, or that neurodegeneration spreads
faster into frontoinsular regions in bvAD compared to tAD, where the frontal regions typically
stay spared until more advanced disease stages. As FDG-PET has been suggested to capture the
same underlying mechanisms with higher sensitivity than MRI43, the overlap of temporoparietal
hypometabolic pattern with the atrophy pattern and additional involvement of frontoinsular
hypometabolism suggests FDG-PET may capture early spread of neurodegeneration into

frontoinsular regions in bvAD. Our findings in a clinically defined group of bvAD patients are
in line with a FDG-PET study showing reduced frontal hypometabolism in AD patients with
pronounced neuropsychiatric symptoms as indicated by a behavioral questionnaire44.
The involvement of the anterior DMN as well as the posterior DMN in bvAD patients provides
insights into their clinical presentation, as the anterior DMN is associated with social cognitive
functions, such as affective self-referential processing and the inference of other’s mental
state25, 45, whereas the posterior DMN has been related to several cognitive processes including
temporal episodic memory and thinking about the future25, 46. bvAD patients resembled tAD
patients in the involvement of posterior DMN (reflecting their shared underlying AD pathology
or cognitive profile), while bvAD patients showed equivalent involvement of the anterior DMN
as bvFTD patients (reflecting their shared behavioral phenotype).
On structural MRI, no subcortical or white matter region was greater affected in bvAD
compared to tAD and bvFTD, and the regional WMHV profiles showed more similarities with
tAD than with bvFTD. The only deep gray matter structure that showed differences between
bvAD and tAD was the amygdala, which showed larger volumes in patients with bvAD than
tAD. Several neuropsychiatric disorders have been associated with enlarged amygdalae, such
as depression47, autism48, and carriers of genetic risk variant for panic disorder and anxiety
comorbidity in depression49. As bvAD patients showed no differences with cognitively normal
controls, one speculative explanation might be that patients with bvAD exhibit larger premorbid
or baseline amygdalae volumes and, with a similar rate of amygdalar atrophy, progress to the
same volumes as cognitively normal individuals. Alternatively, the amygdala may fall further
downstream from the pathophysiological epicenter in bvAD and remain more preserved than
in tAD. Due to its central role in fear processing and responsivity to emotionally salient stimuli,
this structure may be of importance to the clinical phenotype of bvAD.

The ROC analyses showed that functional measures play a pivotal role in the differentiation of
bvAD from tAD and bvFTD. These results are in line with previous work investigating the role
of FDG-PET in diagnosing bvAD44. In addition to neuroimaging markers, there is a need for
improving clinical diagnostic tools. As the assessment of presence of behavioral abnormalities
currently largely depend on subjective ratings of either clinicians or caregivers, future studies
should focus on exploring more objective ways to measure behavioral disturbances, e.g. social
cognition test batteries, observations or validated questionnaires in order to improve diagnostic
accuracy.
Strengths of the current study include the relatively large sample of clinically defined bvAD
patients with multiple neuroimaging markers available. This allowed for a comprehensive
examination of neurobiological features and the clinical utility of a broad range of diagnostic
tools in this relatively rare variant of AD. The results of the present study also need to be viewed
in light of some limitations. First and foremost, data availability across imaging modalities
varied. Although we showed that the ROC analyses yielded largely the same results when
performed in patients with both MRI and FDG-PET modalities available, this is a major
limitation that is due to the retrospective nature of the study as well as the unstandardized data
collection. Other limitations include the lack of fMRI data in this group to study functional
connectivity.
Overall, somewhat contrary to our hypotheses, bvAD patients showed greater overlap of
neuroimaging features with tAD than with bvFTD, further emphasizing their classification as
AD patients as opposed to FTD patients with comorbid amyloid pathology10. Our results show
that differences between bvAD and tAD may lie in functional neuroimaging measures, rather
than neuroanatomical measures and may explain, to some extent, the prominent behavioral
presentation in bvAD. Indeed, functional measures were strong discriminators in the head-tohead comparison of diagnostic accuracy in the differentiation of bvAD from bvFTD and tAD.

However, future studies should investigate other potential neurobiological factors, such as
distribution of tau pathology and involvement of other pathological mechanisms such as
decreased Von Economo Neuron50 density in the anterior cingulate cortex (associated with
social behavior), as well as premorbid personality traits and social cognition in a prospective
cohort of bvAD patients, in order to understand the peculiar behavioral presentation in this AD
variant that seems to hold relatively little reference to our existing conception of clinicoanatomical relationships.

layers of white matter. Radius increases with the distance to the ventricles (center layer: periventricular – outer
layer: juxtacortical). Grayed-out regions indicate regions where the difference when compared to the control group
did not reach significance. Colored regions from light yellow to red indicate the multiplicative factor when
compared to control group after correction for sex, scanner type and total intracranial volume.
