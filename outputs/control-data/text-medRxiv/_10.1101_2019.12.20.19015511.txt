Review
of DAGs in applied health research

ABSTRACT
Background
Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are an increasingly popular approach for identifying confounding variables that
require adjustment when estimating causal effects. This review examined the use of DAGs in applied health
research to inform recommendations for improving their transparency and utility in future research.
Methods
Original health research articles published during 1999-2017 mentioning "directed acyclic graphs” or similar or
citing DAGitty were identified from Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, and Embase. Data were extracted on the
reporting of: estimands, DAGs, and adjustment sets, alongside the characteristics of each article’s largest DAG.
Results
A total of 234 articles were identified that reported using DAGs. A fifth (n=48, 21%) reported their target
estimand(s) and half (n=115, 48%) reported the adjustment set(s) implied by their DAG(s).
Two-thirds of the articles (n=144, 62%) made at least one DAG available. Diagrams varied in size but averaged
12 nodes (IQR: 9-16, range: 3-28) and 29 arcs (IQR: 19-42, range: 3-99). The median saturation (i.e.
percentage of total possible arcs) was 46% (IQR: 31-67, range: 12-100). 37% (n=53) of the DAGs included
unobserved variables, 17% (n=25) included super-nodes (i.e. nodes containing more than one variable, and a
34% (n=49) were arranged so the constituent arcs flowed in a consistent direction.
Conclusions
There is substantial variation in the use and reporting of DAGs in applied health research. Although this partly
reflects their flexibility, it also highlight some potential areas for improvement. This review hence offers several
recommendations to improve the reporting and use of DAGs in future research.

Review
of DAGs in applied health research

INTRODUCTION
Estimating causal effects is a key aim of applied health research.1 One approach is to conduct a randomised
controlled experiment, but practical and ethical constraints mean this is only possible for a limited range of
exposures.2 Most causal effects must therefore be estimated from observational data; a notoriously difficult task
that requires understanding, identifying, and attempting to address the many sources of bias that arise in nonexperimental data, including confounding bias, selection bias, and information bias.3
Observational studies exploring causal effects are nevertheless extremely common in health and medical
research, although their causal aims are rarely described explicitly.4 More often, observational studies adopt
the language of ‘prediction’ or ‘association’ and report ‘independent’ associations or ‘predictors’ after
adjustment for one or more other related variables, typically by including them as covariates in a multivariable
regression model. Many approaches are available to assist with deciding which variables to adjust for from a
list of potential candidates, including various theory-free statistical criteria and algorithms.5 Unfortunately, few of
these conventional approaches explicitly consider the role of each variable in relation to the exposure and
outcome; and it is often unclear why some variables were chosen for consideration and others not. Without this
information, it is very difficult to relate the reported associations to any specific causal effects of interest.6,7
Causal inference approaches, such as the Potential Outcomes Framework, promote greater transparency by
encouraging observational data scientists to formally define the causal effect(s) they seek (i.e. their ‘estimand’)
before they begin their analysis.8 Estimating this effect is then informed by external knowledge of the data
generating process, and by measuring and adjusting for all mutual causes of the exposure and outcome (i.e.
confounders).9,10 However, since the true data generating process can never be known, it must be postulated
from expert knowledge, relevant theory, and plausible assumptions. 9,10
Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) provide a simple and transparent way for observational data scientists to
identify and demonstrate their knowledge, theories, and assumptions about the causal relationships between
variables.11 The implied adjustment set for accurately estimating a causal effect can then be deduced by
inspection or algorithmically, depending on the DAG’s structure and complexity.12–14 Although the accuracy of
the resulting estimate is contingent on how closely the DAG matches the (true) data generating process, the act
of drawing and sharing a DAG makes these assumptions more explicit and open to scrutiny. Despite these
benefits, DAGs are relatively rare within the wider setting of applied health research, likely due to lack of
awareness and cultural ambivilance.15,16
There is also limited practical guidance available on the use and reporting of DAGs in applied research. In
2013, Sauer and VanderWeele offered a list of core considerations, but highlighted a need for a ‘disciplined
approach to developing DAGs’.17 Ferguson et al (2019) responded by offering a structured protocol to aid with
building DAGs,18 but there remains little advice on various practical considerations, including the reporting of:
estimands of interest, DAGs, implied adjustment set(s) and results thereof, and the spatial arrangement of
variables, and the justification for including or omitting dependencies.
This review aims to examine and evaluate the use of DAGs in applied health research to motivate some simple
recommendations to improve the transparency and utility of DAGs in future observational research.

Review
of DAGs in applied health research

METHODS
Overview
The review sought to extract, examine, and summarise information on the use, implementation, and reporting
of causal diagrams that satisfy the definition of a DAG, as provided below, in observational health research. We
were primarily interested in reporting behaviours and technical features of DAG specification that could
motivate subsequent recommendations. These included reporting of: estimands of interest, DAGs, implied
adjustment sets, other adjustment set(s), and the estimates obtained from these adjustment sets. They also
included: the size of each DAG, the inclusion of unobserved variables, the use of 'super-nodes' (i.e. nodes
containing more than one variable), the assumptions and justifications for including or excluding causal
relationships, and whether causal relationships were visually drawn in a consistent direction (e.g. top-to-bottom
or left-to-right).
Definitions
DAGs are typically non-parametric diagrammatic representations of the assumed data generating process for a
set of variables (and measurements thereof) in a specified context. Variables and their measurements are
depicted as nodes (or vertices) connected by unidirectional arcs (or arrows; hence ‘directed’) depicting the
hypothesised relationships between them. An arc between two nodes denotes the assumed existence and
direction of a causal relationship, but does not specify the sign, magnitude, or parametric form. A node cannot
be caused by itself (hence ‘acyclic’), because no variable can cause itself at an instantaneous moment in time,
and the future cannot cause the past.
A path is a collection of one or more arcs that connects two nodes. Paths may be either open or closed; open
paths transmit statistical associations, closed paths do not. A causal path (or direct path) is one where all
constituent arcs flow in the same direction from one node to another. The total causal effect of a specified
exposure (i.e. cause) on a specified outcome (i.e. consequence), which together form the focal relationship,
is the joint effect transmitted through all causal paths connecting the exposure to the outcome. With respect to
the focal relationship, a confounder is a common cause of both the exposure and the outcome, a mediator is
caused by the exposure and in turn causes the outcome (i.e. falls on a causal path between the exposure and
outcome), and a competing exposure is a cause of the outcome that is neither caused by nor causes the
exposure. A direct causal effect is the effect that does not act through one or more specified mediators.
Figure 1 shows the main components of a DAG and the most common types of variable, defined in relation to
the focal relationship.
A confounding path (or indirect path or backdoor path) between an exposure and an outcome is a path that
passes against the flow of causality through one or more confounders (Figure 1). When estimating an
estimand (i.e. the desired causal effect of the exposure on the outcome) from an association, open
confounding paths introduce confounding bias. This bias can be reduced by closing (or blocking) the
confounding path by adjusting for one or more of the nodes on that path, typically by including them
as covariates in a multivariable regression model. A collider path between an exposure and an outcome is a
path that passes against the flow of causality through one or more colliders, i.e. nodes that receive two or
more arcs (Figure 1). Collider paths are closed and do not transmit statistical associations unless the
constituent colliders (or any descendent thereof) are conditioned on. When estimating an estimand from an

association, collider paths which have been opened by conditioning on the constituent colliders will introduce
collider bias. This can occur when estimating direct causal effects if adjustment is made for a mediator that is
caused by one or more common causes of the outcome (known as mediator-outcome confounders). This is
because the mediator in this situation is also a collider on the non-causal path between the exposure and the
outcome through the mediator-outcome confounder.11
A sufficient adjustment set for a particular estimand is any set of variables that, if fully conditioned on, will
provide an unbiased estimate for that estimand by closing all confounding paths and leaving all causal paths
open.19 Competing exposures are not always included in sufficient adjustment sets, unless they are caused by
one or more unobserved confounders for which they can serve as a surrogate confounder.20
Search and inclusion criteria
We searched Scopus, Web of Science, Medline, and Embase for articles published between 01 January 1999
and 31 December 2017 inclusive that contained any of the following terms in their title, abstract, keywords, or
topic: 'graphical model theory', 'directed acyclic graph(s)', 'causal diagram(s)', 'causal graph(s)', or 'causal
DAG'. Articles citing DAGitty online or the DAGitty R software packages were also identified.14,19 Results were
restricted to 'original articles' involving human participants (Medline and Embase) indexed within medicine,
health, social science, psychology, dentistry, nursing, and related fields.
Screening and exclusion criteria
Duplicates were identified and removed before PWGT screened the titles and abstracts to determine eligibility.
Articles not describing original research (such as teaching articles, review articles and commentaries) were
excluded, as were articles not examining health or healthcare in human populations (such as gene ontology
and protein hierarchy studies).
Extraction process
Data were extracted from each article into a standardised database, which was designed, tested, refined,
piloted, and further refined before extraction. PWGT, KFA, MSG, WJH, LB, SCG, CK, and GTHE were each
assigned a random sample of articles for data extraction. Where information was unclear, individual members
of the study team consulted with one or more other members to reach consensus on the appropriate coding. All
data were then re-extracted and double-checked by PWGT, GDT, and GTHE. Discordances between the
original data extraction and the subsequent re-extraction were recorded and considered preliminary 'errors' in
data extraction.
Data of interest
Bibliographic information including author names, journal names, and year of publication were obtained from
bibliographic records. The topic(s) of each article was approximated from the indexing categories of the host
journal in the 2017 Journal Citation Reports from Clarivate Analytics (https://jcr.clarivate.com/).
Data were extracted on the country of the lead author’s primary affiliation, the number of causal diagrams used
and their availability within the manuscript/supplementary materials, and the analytical approach used (noting
where mediation analyses or other less conventional methods were used). For the largest diagram available for

each article (assessed by number of nodes; or number of arcs if tied), we extracted data on the total number of
nodes and total number of arcs, and whether: they were drawn with DAGitty, any unobserved variables were
included, any super-nodes were included,21 the arcs were drawn to flow in a consistent direction (e.g. left-to-right
or top-to-bottom), the diagram included all possible arcs (i.e. was 'saturated' or ‘complete’), and citations were
used to justify the inclusion or exclusion of arcs. To identify the estimand(s) of interest, we searched and
examined occurrences of "estimand”, "effect”, "caus*”, "total”, "direct”, "indirect”. We inspected whether the
implied (sufficient) adjustment set was reported for each estimand or apparent effect of interest, and whether
estimates were reported for these sets explicitly. We also examined whether alternative adjustments sets were
used and, if so, what approaches were used for covariate selection.
Errors in DAG data extraction
The probability of 'error' in the initially-extracted number of nodes and arcs was explored in relation to the most
common diagrammatic features (whether drawn in DAGitty, whether unobserved variables or super-nodes were
included, and whether arcs were drawn in a consistent direction), adjusted for number of arcs and nodes by loglinear regression with robust standard errors. Reported probabilities represent model marginal values, with 95%
confidence intervals (CI) approximated by the delta-method.

RESULTS
Sample description
Figure 2 summarises the derivation of the study sample. A total of 234 eligible articles were identified, including
172 (73.5%) published since the start of 2015 (Figure 3). 230 (98%) articles were written in English and four
(2%) were written in German. Brief details of each paper are provided in Supplementary Table 1.
Figure 3 shows the number of articles published by the country of the first author's primary affiliation. The most
prevalent countries were USA (n=79, 34%), Germany (n=29, 12%), UK (n=17, 7%), and Sweden (n=16, 7%).
187 (80%) were led by North American or Northern European authors.
Articles were published in 152 distinct journals. 33 (22%) journals published more than one article, the most
appearing in PLoS One (n=18), Environmental Health Perspectives (n=10), and Environmental Research (n=8).
These 152 journals covered 50 citation categories, the most prevalent being Public, Environmental, and
Occupational Health (n=75, 32%), Environmental Science (n=26, 11%), and Multidisciplinary Science (n=18,
8%) (Figure 3).
DAG availability, size, and attributes
Causal diagrams were available for 144 (62%) articles. Sixty (42% of those with one or more diagrams
available) included the diagram in the manuscript directly, 81 (56%) in supplementary online material, one
(<1%) provided the diagram on request (Bliddal et al 2016)22 one (<1%) provided a link to the diagram on
www.dagitty.net (Evandt et al 2017A),23 and one (<1%) referred to a diagram from a previous publication
(Buchner & Rehfuess 2015).24 No diagram was available for 90 (38%) articles, including four (1%) articles that
referred to supplementary online materials that were unavailable, one article where the diagram was missing
from supplementary material, one (<1%) where the printed figure was incorrect, and one (<1%) that provided
invalid weblinks to www.dagitty.net.
Of the 144 articles with available diagrams, 116 (81%) included a single diagram and 28 (19%) more than one.
Full details of the largest diagram in each of these 144 articles are provided in Supplementary Table 2, and
summary details are in Table 1. Diagrams varied substantially in size and complexity, with the number of nodes
ranging from 3 to 28 (Median=12, IQR=9-16) and the number of arcs ranging from 3 to 99 (Median=29,
IQR=19-42). The median ratio of arcs to nodes was 2.3 (IQR=1.8-3.0, Range=1.0-5.8) and the median
saturation (i.e. percentage of total possible arcs) was 46% (IQR=31-67, Range 12-100). Just four (3%)
diagrams included all possible arcs (i.e. were ‘saturated’ or ‘complete’).
Fifty-three (37%) diagrams included one or more unobserved variable (see Example 1 and Example 2); 27
(19%) included one or more specific unobserved variables and 29 (20%) included one or more generic
unobserved variables. Twenty-five (17%) diagrams included one or more super-nodes (See Example 3). Forthnine (34%) diagrams were arranged so that the constituent arcs flowed in a consistent direction (see Example
4, and Example 5 for contrast); five (3%) flowed from top-to-bottom, 22 (15%) flowed from left-to-right, and 22
(15%) flowed diagonally from one corner to another. Eight (6%) provided citations to support the inclusion of
one or more arcs (see Example 6).

Review
of DAGs in applied health research

Errors in DAG data extraction
First round data extraction errors occurred among 56 (39%) DAGs; including two (1%) where the number of
nodes were miscounted, 48 (33%) where the number of arcs were miscounted, and six (4%) where both were
miscounted. The proportion of errors increased with the number of nodes [4.2% per node (95% CI: 1.5, 7.0)] or
arcs [1.6% per arc (95% CI: 1.0, 2.2)]. Conditional on these, the proportion of errors was lower among
diagrams drawn in DAGitty [32% (95% CI: 23, 42) vs 50% (95% CI: 36, 64) among diagrams not drawn in
DAGitty] or where the arcs flowed consistently from top-to-bottom or left-to-right [30% (12, 47) vs 41% (95% CI:
31, 51) among diagrams without consistent direction] but not where arcs flowed diagonally from corner-tocorner [44% (95% CI: 20, 67)] (Supplementary Table 3). There were negligible differences in the proportion of
errors among diagrams that included unobserved variables [42% (95% CI: 28, 56) vs 37% (95% CI: 31, 51)
without unobserved variables] or super-nodes [39% (95% CI: 17, 61) vs 39% (95% CI: 31, 48) without supernodes] (Supplementary Table 3).
Reporting of estimands and adjustment sets
Of the 234 included articles, 208 (89%) conducted multivariable regression analyses, 13 (6%) conducted
mediation analyses, 4 (2%) conducted g-method analyses, and 9 (2%) conducted other or mixed analyses.
Full details regarding the reporting of estimands and adjustment sets are provided in Supplementary Table 4,
while summary details are in Table 1. Only 48 (21%) articles explicitly reported one or more causal effect
estimand of interest, comprising 18 (8%) that sought total causal effects, 12 (5%) that sought direct causal
effects, and 18 (8%) that sought multiple effects. 115 (49%) articles clearly reported the adjustment set(s)
implied by their DAG(s), including 90 (38%) who specifically stated one or more sufficient adjustment set.
Of the 115 articles that reported one or more DAG-implied adjustment set(s), 101 (88%) reported the causal
effect estimate obtained from this adjustment set specifically (i.e. with no covariates added or removed)
including 95 (76%) where these formed the primary results. Estimates from other (i.e. bespoke) or unclearly
derived adjustment sets were reported in 171 (73%) of the total 234 articles, including 159 (68%) where these
formed the primary results.
Finally, 42 (18%) studies applied additional statistical criteria or algorithms for covariate selection, including 28
(12%) that used change-in-estimate criteria and 14 (6%) that used p-value criteria.

Review
of DAGs in applied health research

DISCUSSION
Summary of findings
This review examined the use of DAGs in applied health research. Although they remain very rare within the
wider literature, an increasing absolute number of observational studies in health, medicine, and related areas
are using and presenting causal diagrams to aid confounder selection. There is however substantial variation in
the way these diagrams are reported and used, with potential impacts on the study results and the contributions
towards increasing transparency and scrutiny of the analytical assumptions.
DAGs were not always presented, and in some instances very little information was provided regarding their
construction or use (see Supplementary Table 4 and Supplementary Table 5). Where DAGs were presented,
they varied substantially in the number of variables and arcs included, the inclusion of unobserved variables,
the inclusion of super-nodes, details on their design, and how they were used to inform the subsequent
statistical modelling. Some studies presented simplified illustrations of the relationships between only a few
variables considered key to the focal relationship (e.g. Wei et al 2016)25, others presented large schematics
with multiple interconnected measured variables (e.g. Ng et al 2017A)26, but a minority incorporated many, if
any, unobserved variables. In general, diagrams included relatively few arcs per node and very few were
‘saturated’ or ‘complete’, where each variable in turn is assumed to (potentially) cause all future variables.
Only half of the articles reported the adjustment set(s) implied by their DAG(s), and only a fifth stated their
target estimands, with most instead referring to the 'association', 'relationship', or 'effect'. Several studies used
additional statistical criteria or algorithms to reduce the number of candidate variables, while others made
bespoke modifications to their adjustment set(s) for other subjective reasons not implied by their DAG(s) (e.g.
"An additional set of covariates was considered important to include in the full model because of their wellestablished association with exposure and outcome” (Weyde et al 2017A)27 (see Supplementary Table 4 and
Supplementary Table 5).
Observations and remarks
This review explicitly considered the use of DAGs in applied health research, where they were used not simply
to discuss causal inference theory but to ‘identify variables necessary for adjustment’ (Upson et al 2013).28
Although such applications are widely marketed as a key benefit of DAGs, it is contested whether they actually
lead to more accurate and/or reliable effect estimates.15,16
Harder to dispute are the potential benefits for transparency. Compared with traditional approaches to selecting
candidate variables and adjustment sets, DAGs encourage observational data scientists to declare their
assumptions about the data generating process for the data they are analysing, which clearly facilitates
external scrutiny. Reporting the estimand(s) of interest and DAG-implied adjustment set(s) offer similar benefits
to the clarity of the study aim(s) and the model interpretability.
Unfortunately, many of the articles reviewed did not report their DAG(s) and fewer still declared their
estimand(s) of interest. Reluctance to share such details may reflect a lack of awareness of the benefits of
these details for readers, lack of confidence, fear of criticism, cultural reticence, and/or a lack of encouragement
or facilitation from journals, editors, and reviewers. These may also explain why some articles adopted hybrid

approaches to variable selection that combined DAG-based approaches with traditional statistical approaches,
or where investigators overruled the DAG-implied adjustment set(s) by adding or removing covariates. Such
actions suggest a need for practical guidance and supporting materials that are accessible to data analysts,
journal editors and reviewers. Regardless, several recommendations emerge from recognising the best
practices among the studies reviewed (see below).
Further benefits may also be achieved by emphasising the different assumptions made from the inclusion and
omission of arcs within DAGs. Although a small number of articles reported 'saturated' DAGs (i.e. where
preceding variables are assumed to potentially cause all future variables) the majority of the available diagrams
included less than half of all possible arcs. Since a confounder must cause both the exposure and outcome,
inadvertently omitting either of these arcs may result in a confounder being mislabelled and omitted from the
DAG-implied adjustment set, leading to unadjusted confounding. Such omissions may be explained by a
cultural aversion to declaring potential causal relationships in observational data without a strong theoretical
basis or definitive empirical evidence.4 This may also explain why some authors included citations to justify the
inclusion of arcs within their diagrams. This is arguably unnecessary since omitting an arc invokes the greater
assumption, because no arc between two variables declares there is no causal relationship between the two
variables, regardless of direction, sign, strength, or parametric form.11 Increasing the number of arcs does
however bring practical challenges that may also explain the absence of plausible arcs. In general, it is difficult
to draw causal diagrams with multiple nodes and multiple arcs; both to ensure that all potential arcs have been
included and that the diagram remains decipherable to the reader. We observed that the proportion of data
extraction errors increased with the number of nodes and arcs, although this could also result from an
increasing number of objects available for miscounting. Subjectively, we judged that DAGs that had been
drawn so that their arcs flowed consistently from left-to-right or top-to-bottom were easier to interpret and
critique. This appears to be supported by the lower proportion of data extraction errors among DAGs that had
been arranged in either of these ways. Several algorithms exist to help with arranging a DAG into strict
temporal 'layers',29 but they do not appear to have been widely adopted in applied settings. Alternatively, for
‘saturated’ or ‘complete’ DAGs, it may be reasonable to simplify several details (e.g. using paired arrow-heads
indicating ‘arcs to all future nodes’)30 because the sufficient adjustment set for any exposure-outcome
relationship will simply include all variables that temporally precede the exposure.
Recommendations
1) The focal relationship(s) and estimand(s) of interest should be stated in the study aims
Causal inference methods separate the process of identifying the quantity of interest (i.e. estimand) from the
process of estimating that quantity, with the latter being informed by the former. To reflect this, all estimands of
interest should be clearly stated in the study aims or at the beginning of the article’s methods section before
details on how estimation was attempted (e.g. this study aimed to estimate the total causal effect of type-2
diabetes at aged 50-years on the ten-year risk of myocardial infarction).
2) The causal diagram(s) for each focal relationship and estimand of interest should be available
Causal diagrams explicitly depict the investigators’ assumptions about the data generating process of their
dataset. The accuracy of any ensuing effect estimate is fundamentally contingent on the extent to which the
diagram (as specified) reflects the true data-generating process. The diagram used to inform the model for

estimating every causal effect estimate should therefore be available to all potential readers. This may be
achieved by reproducing the diagram in the manuscript directly, in supplementary material, or by providing
functional weblinks to a well-established open-source platform such as www.dagitty.net.
3) Causal diagrams should include all relevant variables, including those where direct measurements are
unavailable
The causal diagram for a specific focal relationship should include all potential confounding variables (i.e. that
may potentially cause both the exposure and the outcome), regardless of whether direct measurements are
available or possible. Explicitly depicting unobserved variables helps to highlight potential sources of
unobserved confounding.
4) Variables should be arranged so that arcs flow in a consistent direction
Arcs depict causal processes that occur over time. Causal diagrams, and the relationships they symbolise, are
therefore considerably easier to interpret when the constituent variables are arranged spatially in a way that
clearly reflects the passage of time, with arcs flowing consistently from left-to-right or top-to-bottom.
5) Arcs should generally be assumed to exist between any two variables
Omitting an arc between two variables implies that there is precisely no causal effect of one on the other. This
is a much stronger statistical assumption than is implied when an arc is included, which allows a causal effect
of any sign, magnitude, or parametric form (including a very small effect). Omitted arcs should therefore be
carefully considered and ideally justified with theory and/or evidence.
6) The DAG-implied adjustment set(s) for the estimand(s) of interest should be clearly stated
The sufficient adjustment set(s) implied by a causal diagram to estimate every estimand of interest should be
stated explicitly, including variables for which measurements are not available for adjustment.
7) The estimate(s) obtained from using the unmodified DAG-implied adjustment set(s) should be reported
The estimate(s) obtained from using the unmodified DAG-implied sufficient adjustment set(s) should always be
reported, even if not considered or interpreted as central to the study findings.
8) Alternative adjustment set(s) should be justified and their estimate(s) reported separately
If alternative adjustment set(s) are used, they should be clearly described and justified, and the ensuing
estimates should be reported separately to those reported using the DAG-implied adjust set. Modifications to
DAG-implied adjustment sets may comprise the inclusion of competing exposures, surrogate confounders, or
variables with ambiguous causal roles for the purposes of sensitivity analyses. Where alternatives DAGs are
hypothesised, it may be helpful to evaluate their consistency with the observed data.19 Where direct causal
effects are sought, these should be clearly stated in the aims as effects of interest, and their adjustment sets
derived accordingly.

Review
of DAGs in applied health research

Strength and weaknesses
This is the largest and most comprehensive review of the use of DAGs in applied research, whether in health,
medicine, or otherwise. We identified and examined in excess of 200 articles published over several years
across a diverse range of fields. The sample is however somewhat ill-defined and should not be considered to
reflect the population of observational health research studies that have used DAGs. It is not clear what
proportion of such studies mention their use of DAGs in their abstract or keywords, but we suspect many do
not. A large proportion of the sample was therefore identified from having cited the DAGitty.net software
package. Studies that used DAGitty.net for drawing their DAG(s) or determining their adjustment set(s) are
likely over-represented. A lower proportion of data extraction errors occurred among DAGs that had been
drawn using DAGitty, which may indicate some feature differences, but it may also indicate a training effect due
to increased reviewer familiarity. We believe that the issues we describe, and their implications, are likely to be
applicable to the use and reporting of causal diagrams irrespective of the tools used to construct and scrutinise
these DAG(s).
Extracting data for the 234 articles included in this review was laborious and a substantial time therefore
passed between the sample was identified and extraction was complete. We nevertheless decided not to
update our search to include more recent articles (i.e. published from 2018 onwards) because we do not
believe there will have been any substantial changes in practice in the intervening time.
Because of the quantity of information sought and the diversity of the studies examined, it was impossible to
develop a data-extraction form that was entirely compatible with all the included articles. Some data items
therefore required subjective judgement, inter-rater discussion, and/or further simplification, and others simply
could not be synthesised due to a lack of standardisation in reporting. Even when using a reduced set of items
for data extraction, clarity and transparency varied substantially between studies making it challenging to
accurately identify all relevant information. All data was therefore extracted in triplicate, with the first extraction
used to evaluate the 'readability' of the most objective diagram features. Occasional data extraction errors or
discordances between the authors intended message and our interpretation are nevertheless still inevitable; but
these should not materially alter the review results, messages, and/or recommendations.
We offer several recommendations for improving the reporting, specification, and application of DAGs in
applied health research where causal effect estimates are sought from observational data. Studies that have
not followed these practices should not however be considered necessarily less rigorous, less accurate, or less
valuable. DAGs represent the investigators’ assumptions and hypotheses about the data generating process
for a specific dataset. Where the DAG does not accurately reflect the true data generating mechanism, the
ensuing estimates are likely to be unreliable. However, since the true process can never be known, a DAG can
arguably only be wrong if it fails to correctly represent those assumptions and hypotheses. We therefore did not
attempt to evaluate the plausibility of individual DAGs and instead focussed on identifying those areas where
the implications of the DAG may not have met the investigators’ intentions. We offer no negative judgements on
the intentions of individual authors or the veracity of individual studies. On the contrary, we welcome the large
and growing number of applied health researchers who have used DAGs to assist with estimating causal
effects in observational data and explored their benefits for declaring their assumptions, identifying potential
sources of bias, identifying data for collection, and improving statistical analyses. These ‘early adopters’ have

not only helped to reveal some potential pitfalls in the use of DAGs but have provided a growing wealth of
innovative exemplars that will inspire future developments in this evolving field.
Conclusion
DAGs are increasingly popular in applied health research as a transparent means of identifying confounding
variables that require adjustment to estimate causal effects. This review examined their use in over 200
empirical studies of health, medicine, and related disciplines, and found substantial variation in their size,
structure, complexity, availability, and implementation. While such variety partly reflects the inherent flexibility
and subjectivity of DAGs, it also helps to highlight several potential pitfalls and aspirational practices.
Consequently, we offer a list of simple recommendations for improving both the transparency and benefits of
DAGs in observational research that we hope will help towards the ongoing development of these techniques.

Review
of DAGs in applied health research

Example 2 (Hinkle et al 2013)
Showing a DAG where a (single) generic variable has been included to represent a cluster of unobserved
variables; here denoted using Structural Equation Modelling notation with an ellipse. This helps to emphasise
the collective influence of these unobserved variables but does less to indicate which of the underlying
variables are thought most important.

Review
of DAGs in applied health research

Example 3 (Asgari et al 2011)
Showing a DAG that includes super-nodes, i.e. nodes that contain more than one variable (e.g. in this diagram
the Demographics node contains Gender, Age, and Race/ethnicity). This makes the diagram easier to interpret
but increases the potential risk of misspecification.

Review
of DAGs in applied health research

Example 4 (Reiner et al 2016)
Showing a DAG, which has been arranged so the constituent arcs flow consistently from top-to-bottom.
Diagrams arranged in this manner are easier to interpret.

Review
of DAGs in applied health research

Example 5 (Gocke et al 2014)
Showing a DAG where the arcs do not flow in a consistent direction. This has no impact on the plausibility or
validity of the diagram, but it does make it harder to interpret.

Page 883:
"Based on our a priori assumptions on the relationships between confounders, intermediate variables, exposure, and outcome variables, we were able to draw a directed
acyclic graph (DAG), with the aim to identify the minimal set of variables to adjust for the total effect (presented as supplementary material). To draw the DAG, the webbased application DAGitty (http://www.dagitty.net) was used. In the multivariable analyses we first controlled for the following potential confounders: sex, body mass
index…level of education…smoking status…alcohol consumption…total physical activity…and major diseases…. In addition, two more variables suggested by the DAG
were considered, namely occupational status and depression. However, these two variables were not included due to a large proportion of missingness and degree of
potential misclassification”

Page 1183:
"We developed DAGs for all cofactors that emerged from the literature that could be potential confounders in the relation between parity and prediabetes…We found that we
needed to adjust for six potential confounding factors: (i) maternal age, (ii) educational status, (iii) family income, (iv) year of delivery, (v) physical activity and (vi) eating
disorders. Although BMI and hypertension are considered risk factors for the development of prediabetes and diabetes, we did not adjust for those cofactors because they
are unlikely risk factors for HP. Therefore, it was more appropriate to consider it an intermediate in the causal pathway, and made it unnecessary to adjust for it in the
analysis”
"We could not adjust for physical activity and eating disorders because of lack of sufficient information about those cofactors”
"In the full models, we adjusted in addition to maternal age for potential confounding factors resulting from the DAGs: educational level, family income and year of delivery.”

"We developed a framework (Additional file 1) to visualize the relationship between the study variables using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) (Fig. 1a and b) plotted by
Dagitty (http://dagitty.net/). In the 1st framework, the outcome was the need for prosthodontic care and the exposures were untreated decay and need for periodontal care.
Several factors were included because they were related to these two oral diseases and were divided into practices that increase their risk and demographic factors. The
other framework showed the association between the impact on daily life and need for prosthodontic care in addition to untreated decay…Univariate regression models
were developed to include each exposure/ confounder followed by a multivariable model controlling for the identified confounders”

Andell et al 2014

"Adjustments for potential confounders were performed stepwise in two models, the first including age, sex, smoking status and comorbidities (previous MI, previous stroke,
heart failure, renal failure, hypertension, diabetes, peripheral artery disease, cancer and previous bleeding). The second model also included treatments during
hospitalisation and at discharge (heparin, fondaparinux, dalteparin, enoxaparin, GPIIbIIIa-inhibitors, β-blockers, balloon angioplasty, coronary stenting, as well as discharge
medications including ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers, aspirin, clopidogrel, prasugrel, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, digoxin, diuretics, statins,
nitrates and warfarin). The selection of covariates included in these models was performed with the use of a direct acyclical graph via a web-based tool (http://www.

"A second adjustment method using a propensity score as a continuous covariate in a Cox proportional hazard model was tested to ascertain whether a different adjustment
model would impact the result differently. The propensity score was calculated using a logistic regression model, and using the direct acyclic graph, the following covariates
were identified as dependent determinants for the exposure of being discharged with b-blockers: age, sex, smoking status, previous stroke, previous MI, heart failure,
diabetes, hypertension, renal failure, cancer, b-blockers therapy at presentation, STEMI, coronary angiography, coronary stenting, and COPD medications at presentation."

models adjusting for age and sex; (2) models for estimating total causal effects, adjusting for age, sex, education, and previous myocardial infarction; and (3) models for
estimating direct causal effects, adjusting for age, sex, alcohol use, BMI, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, myocardial infarction during follow-up, previous myocardial

Andreano et al 2017

Page 121:
"We constructed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to represent assumptions regarding the underlying causal relationships between guideline adherence, survival and a set of
clinical and socioeconomic variables. The DAG (Online Resource 1) utilizes these assumptions to select the potential confounders, rather than relying on the statistical
associations observed in the data at hand. The selected confounders are then used in the statistical analysis aiming at evaluating the ‘causal’ impact of receiving a care
adherent to guidelines on survival."
Page 122:
"To investigate the ‘causal’ relationship between survival and adherence (dichotomous variable with a 80% cut-off), we fitted an inverse probability weighted (IPW) marginal
structural model. After selecting potential confounders based on the DAG, we created a pseudo-population by the use of (stabilized) inverse probability of adherence
weights to mitigate the differences between patients with adherent and nonadherent care. These weights were estimated through a multivariable logistic regression model
on adherence, including as covariates the potential confounders: molecular type, stage, grade, their first-degree interactions, age (always as a continuous variable with
restricted cubic spline functions), Charlson comorbidity index, number of positive nodes, marital status, employment, education, and deprivation index."

Arora et al 2014

Page 645:
"A series of multivariable models were developed to better assess the influence of confounding. On the basis of data availability, we focus on confounding by
sociodemographic indicators (age, sex, race/ethnicity and educational level), health behaviours (smoking status, caloric intake, alcohol consumption and physical activity)
and adiposity (body mass index). We also consider variables that might mediate the association between periodontal infection and pre-diabetes (blood pressure, cholesterol
profile, WBC and CRP). Models were additionally informed by two Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) constructed using, Dagitty. Figure 1A assumes more complex causal
structures in which potential sociodemographic confounders relate to periodontal infection and pre-diabetes through multiple mechanisms (e.g. confounding can act through
health behaviours and adiposity but also through other mechanisms not represented in our data); this causal structure necessitates adjustment for all sociodemographic
variables. Alternatively, the DAG in Figure 1B assumes that all confounding effects act through either health behaviours or adiposity; this causal structure does not require
adjustment for sociodemographic variables if health behaviours and adiposity adjustments are made…
"The following multivariable models were considered. Model 2 adjusted for only health behaviours (smoking status, caloric intake, alcohol consumption and physical activity)
and a marker of adiposity (body mass index) based on assumptions inherent in Figure 1B. Model 3 adjusted for only the sociodemographic variables age, sex, race/ethnicity
and educational level. Model 4 adjusted for health behaviours and sociodemographic variables. Model 5 adjusted for sociodemographics, health behaviours and adiposity.

Tennant et al 2019

Review of DAGs in applied health research
Finally, model 6 expanded model 5 by additionally adjusting for variables that could be considered as either a confounder or mediator of associations between periodontal
infection and pre-diabetes depending on the causal structure hypothesized; this model included adjustment for systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol-to-HDL ratio, WBC
and CRP as previous reports suggest periodontal infection as a possible risk factor for these outcomes. Unless otherwise stated, ORs reported in the main text were derived
from model 5 as we believe this provides the best combination of parsimony and validity…
"To provide additional information regarding the magnitude and direction of confounding by the aforementioned variables considered individually, we also constructed tables
summarizing the difference between parameter estimates from logistic models with more versus less covariable adjustment using a "change-in-estimate” approach;
changein- estimate was defined as follows: [(LN (more adjusted OR) LN (less adjusted OR))/LN (adjusted OR)] × 100, yielding the percent change in the OR resulting from
lack of adjustment. The approach uses 13 model selection iterations (the number of possible covariables). Iteration 1 started with the unadjusted parameter estimate for
periodontal infection and then ran 13 separate regressions considering the influence of all potential confounders on the unadjusted parameter estimate. The confounder that
produced the greatest change-in-estimate was added to the regression to form an "intermediate” model and another modelling iteration was repeated; each modelling
iteration increases the number of independent variables in the intermediate model by 1 and decreases the number of remaining confounders by 1. Four variables
hypothesized as possible mediators were assessed in the last four interactions. Results from our change-in-estimate analysis did not suggest that the aforementioned
models 1–6 would be inappropriate."

Asgari et al 2011

Page 1389:
"The causal DAG used in this study is shown in the Figure. We hypothesized causal relationships among variables based on previously published literature about patient
satisfaction relative to age, gender, race/ethnicity, socioeconomic variables (education status, income, marital status, and site of care), mental health, comorbidities,
preoperative skin-related QOL, tumor-related factors (size, location, invasiveness, recurrence, and type), and postoperative variables. Also hypothesized to influence patient
satisfaction and included in the model were intraoperative variables, such as the number of stages, defect size, and repair type, some of which been shown to be associated
with long-term cosmesis. Postoperative variables, such as time lost for treatment, bother from bleeding, included in the model because they were deemed likely to influence
patient satisfaction. Although it may be possible to draw different DAGs based on varying causal assumptions, we believed that this DAG best captured the causal
relationships among the factors based on known temporal ordering of the variables, the existing literature on patient satisfaction, and clinical judgment. According to the
assumptions in the DAG, we determined a set of adjusting variables for each exposure and used standard logistic regression analysis of the outcome on the exposure,
including all covariates in the adjustment set (no interaction terms were considered). The associations between the exposure and the outcome revealed by our models (ie,
the coefficient in front of the exposure variables) rely on the aforementioned causal DAG assumptions, as well as on correct specification of the parametric logistic
regression model (eg, the absence of interaction terms between exposures and covariates)."
Table 2 (footer):
"aModels for each demographic variable were adjusted for the remaining demographic variables. Models for each socioeconomic factor variable were adjusted for the
remaining socioeconomic factor variables and all demographic variables. Model for the site-of-care variable was adjusted for all socioeconomic factor variables. Model for
previous nonmelanoma skin cancer was adjusted for all demographic and socioeconomic factor variables. Models for each physical health variable were adjusted for the
remaining physical health variables and all demographic and socioeconomic factor variables. Model for the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey mental component score was
adjusted for all demographic and socioeconomic factor variables. Models for the preoperative skin quality-of-life variables were adjusted for the remaining preoperative skin
quality-of-life variables plus demographic, socioeconomic factor, mental health, and tumor characteristic variables. Models for each tumor characteristic variable were
adjusted for the remaining tumor characteristic variables plus demographic, socioeconomic factor, and previous nonmelanoma skin cancer variables. Models for each
intraoperative event variable were adjusted for the remaining intraoperative event variables plus tumor characteristic variables. Models for each postoperative variable were

"We constructed two directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to map hypothesised pathways and temporal contributions between variables. The DAGs are presented in Figs. 2 and
3, and guided our analysis plan. In Fig. 2, local employment was the exposure variable. In Fig. 3, mode access to employment was the exposure variable, with local
employment operating as an adjusting variable. All models were adjusted for individual-level sociodemographic confounders, as these were hypothesised to impact on
sedentary behaviour (i.e. sex) or self-rated health (i.e. age, marital status, education, income). The conceptual framework suggested the potential importance of ‘mode of
travel to work’ and ‘vehicle miles travelled’, and these were included in the DAGs as latent variables, as these data were not collected in the VicHealth Indicators Survey…
"Multivariate logistic regression models were used to compare the spatial neighbourhood-level employment measures with the likelihood of reporting longer commuting
times, longer sitting time, and poorer selfrated health (based on the median splits). Direct and pathway associations were examined. Neighbourhood-level employment
analyses were adjusted for sex, age, education, employment, marital status, household income, and clustering at the local area…

"This study, two alternative DAGs, depicted in Figures 1-2, were used to illustrate assumed relationships between early lifecourse factors and ECC. Before being included in
the DAGs, possible direct paths between all variables considered were evaluated for plausibility based on theory and previous empirical evidence. The wealth asset index
was assumed to have direct effects on dental attendance, family sugar consumption, anthropometric status, family oral hygiene, breastfeeding duration and breastfeeding
exclusivity. Maternal education was assumed to have direct effects on dental attendance, family sugar consumption, marital status, anthropometric status, family oral
hygiene, breastfeeding duration and EBF. Marital status was assumed to have direct effects on the wealth assets index, dental attendance, family oral hygiene,
breastfeeding duration and EBF. Breastfeeding duration was assumed to have direct effects on anthropometric status, family sugar consumption, enamel hypoplasia, and
cariogenic bacteria. Family oral hygiene was assumed to have direct effects on cariogenic bacteria and ECC, whereas family sugar consumption was assumed to have
direct effects on family oral hygiene, EBF, anthropometric status and cariogenic bacteria. Anthropometric status was assumed to have direct effects on breastfeeding
exclusivity and enamel hypoplasia. Enamel hypoplasia was assumed to affect cariogenic bacteria and ECC. Cariogenic bacteria were assumed to have direct effects on
ECC. Early childhood caries was assumed to have a direct effect on dental attendance. A direct effect of EBF on ECC was hypothesized; hence causal paths between EBF
and ECC, mediated through cariogenic bacteria and enamel hypoplasia, were included in the DAGs. In summary, proximal individual- and family-level covariates;
anthropometric status (individual level), breastfeeding duration (individual), sugar consumption (family level) and oral hygiene (family level) were assumed to have direct
effects on ECC, whereas the effect of more distal family-level covariates; socioeconomic status, maternal education, and marital status were assumed to be mediated
through the proximal variables. Dental attendance was assumed to be a collider variable in some paths (model Figure 1) and a mediator in other paths (model 2, Figure 2).
Unmeasured variables in terms of enamel hypoplasia and cariogenic bacteria were included in the DAGs for the purpose of providing a clearer picture of the assumed
causal mechanisms."

"Causal models were developed by all authors using the free online tool "DAGitty" (Additional files 1 and 2). The minimally sufficient adjustment set for addressing all three
outcomes consisted of time of year, time of week, and shift (time of day). The adjustment set was entered into the logistic equation using the entry method instead of a
stepwise method. Interaction terms included were based on empirical knowledge and comprised occupancy ashift. Independent variables of the minimally sufficient
adjustment set not significantly associated with the outcome were retained to prevent bias. Interaction terms of weaker association with the outcome than p = .05 upon
inclusion in the model were omitted…
"To improve the face validity of the multivariable models, sensitivity analysis was performed by expanding the minimally sufficient adjustment set (step 1) in two subsequent

ED via primary triage, the second indicating whether ED input was high during the simultaneous shift, and the third indicating year 2013, which captures the introduction of
RETTS©, increased responsibility for surgical patients at the EM facility, and the introduction of an observation unit— were added to the list of covariates. The selection of

care over time during the study period); region, to account for possible differences in trauma care between regions; and receiving hospital for outcomes other than
prehospital mortality, to account for possible differences in trauma care between hospitals. We assumed other covariates would affect only exposure or outcomes. We also
derived more complex multivariable models with variables generally considered to be potential confounders in a trauma study. These models included the variables age,
sex, injury severity, role of the injured victim, and comorbidity."

peripheral vascular disease), type and severity of myocardial infarction and treatment (Fig. S1). We performed the analysis in four steps to investigate the effect of each set
of covariates using a complete case analysis: (i) model 1, adjusting for age (continuous) and gender (n = 209 592); (ii) model 2, additionally adjusting for cardiovascular
disease risk factors [smoking: never smoker (reference), ex-smoker, current smoker; diabetes; previous hypertension; heart failure; stroke; and peripheral vascular disease

"Directed acyclic graph (causal diagram) was used to inform the choice of other covariates. The following known or possible NHL risk factors were included on the causal
diagram: alcohol consumption, autoimmune disorders, educational attainment (as a proxy for socioeconomic status), energy intake, ethnicity, family history of NHL, immune
function, obesity, smoking, sun exposure, and vitamin D intake (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Associations between these variables, and the direction of the associations,
were based on the published literature. Immune function, sun exposure, and obesity were assumed to be on the causal pathway. Ethnicity, educational attainment, and
autoimmune disease were identified as a minimal sufficient set of confounders, and a model containing these three variables and the frequency-matching variables was
considered the "fully-adjusted" model. To increase precision, we then used the backward deletion strategy to remove confounders until the change-in-estimate from the
"fully adjusted" model was greater than 5%. Ethnicity (along with the frequency-matching variables) was the only covariate that remained in the model following this
procedure."

confounders (ie, a set of confounders that ‘blocked’ all backdoor (confounding) pathways, based on the assumptions made in the directed acyclic graph). The following
known or possible breast cancer risk factors were considered as potential confounders and were included in the causal diagram: ethnicity (based on self-reported ethnicity
in the CBCS and country of birth in the BCEES), education, family history of breast cancer, age at menarche, number of births, age at first birth, breast feeding, use of oral
contraceptives, use of hormone therapy, smoking status, alcohol consumption, recreational physical activity in early adulthood, recent recreational physical activity, body
mass index in early adulthood, recent body mass index, total duration of employment, ever worked shift work and years worked in an active occupation (see online

status and years worked in an active occupation. In sensitivity analyses, smoking status and alcohol consumption were added to the final pooled models, and their inclusion

care-seeking, transportation, affordability), household socio-economic status (i.e. maternal and paternal education, maternal and paternal occupation, wealth, income) and
contextual factors (i.e. ethnicity, urban/rural location, geographical location). We attempted to populate this diagram with relevant DHS variables at individual/household
level (Table 2). In addition, we included child age, sex and birth order as non-modifiable risk factors, and developed the country-level variable rainy season as a further
contextual factor to indicate whether the interview took place during the rainy or dry season, with the information obtained from the CIA factbook and other relevant sources

gain), maternal smoking during pregnancy (yes/no), and breastfeeding (ever/never) to account for earlylife factors that are associated with childhood overweight status
(Weng et al. 2012). We adjusted for calendar date of urine collection to account for temporal trends in phthalate exposure and prevalence of childhood obesity. Additionally,
we adjusted for natural log creatinine (to account for urine dilution), child’s sex, months of age at follow-up, and a product term between child’s sex and months of age at

some of the factors like income and employment might act through dental insurance. Therefore, by adjusting for dental insurance (main exposure variable), it can be argued

highest education (prehigh school, high school, post-high school). Though not identified as confounders in the DAG, further co-variates that were identified based on

All co-variates were tested
individually in the logistic regression analysis to assess the potential impact on the association between mode of delivery and school performance. As no variable changed

"Causal diagrams were set up to determine the necessary adjustments in the multivariate models using DAGitty v. 2.3. We were interested in the total effect of self-reported
occupational noise and vibration since the direct effect, albeit of theoretical importance, is not observed per se in real life. In order to investigate the complex imbrication of
various environmental and individual risks for the CVD, even factors that we had no data on (i.e., diet, physical activity, heredity, body mass index, residential exposures)
were included in the diagrams. Their absence, however, was found to be acceptable, since they were necessary covariates for the direct rather than the total effect model.
The suggested minimal sufficient set of covariates for estimating the total effect of self-reported occupational noise/vibration on heart disease included: age, gender,
workweek hours, length of service, shift work, and other co-exposures. We additionally forced into the models (as proxies for participants’ socioeconomic status) the number
of household members and the age at which full-time education was finished"

"Potentially confounding variables were integrated using Directed Acyclic Graphs. Regarding tobacco consumption, SES, age, sex, and household size were considered as
potentially confounding variables; regarding alcohol consumption, SES, age, sex, TNM classification, cancer site, and household size were considered as potential
confounders. According to the Directed Acyclic Graphs model, comorbidities were a potential confounding variable for alcohol consumption as well, but unfortunately, this
information was not collected routinely in our study, so there was no possibility to adjust for it."

"A causal path model was then developed (in the form of a Directed Acyclic Graph [DAG] drawn using www.dagitty.net open source software) to distinguish between
confounders and mediators in any relationships between each of the sociodemographic and socioeconomic variables and health, assuming that only variables relating to
pre-existing characteristics and past events could act as potential confounders (see Figure 1). This model assumed that age, sex and population group classification were

all determined simultaneously (at birth) and that these all influenced educational attainment, migration status, employment status, type of dwelling, household crowding,
household services and assets, adult food insecurity and, thereafter, health in a sequential fashion. This model then prescribed the sequence with which potential
confounders were entered into multivariable logistic analyses examining the relationship between each sociodemographic and socioeconomic variable and health, in order
to adjust for potential confounding. This involved including sex, age and population classification in all analyses examining the relationship between these three
sociodemographic variables and health; while each of the variables relating to household services and assets were adjusted only for preceding sociodemographic and
socioeconomic characteristics (including type of dwelling and crowding) and not for other household services or assets, on the grounds that these were likely to be highly
collinear. Finally, to test the possibility that self-reported disability preceded educational attainment and thereafter migration status (rather than being a contemporaneous
measure of recent/current health status), the multivariable logistic regression analyses were repeated to assess the impact of adjusting for disability (i.e. assuming this to be
a potential confounder) in the relationships between individual- and household-level socioeconomic status and health (see Figure 1)."

previously mentioned covariates were considered potential adjustment variables for the association between well-being and growth hormone. The minimally sufficient

effect of AJ and the risk of developing AKI, statistical models should also include age, indication for procedure, hematocrit drop and surgery; as each of these could
independently cause AKI. Individual statistical modeling for each of these groups of variables was not statistically significant (data available upon request) and our findings

"Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) served as a visual guide to identify variables pertinent to the multivariate models and potential confounders on the outcome of interest.
DAGs allowed us to include variables believed to be causal to the exposure of interest and exclude variables that could not be causal. The DAG, Figure 1, shows relations
among the exposures of interest, the outcomes, and other covariates. During the analysis, each policy used a separate analytical model, based on the assumptions
illustrated in the DAG. The enforcement of policies, for example, although important, falls on the causal pathway between written polices and physical assault and,
therefore, was not included in analyses."

"To avoid overadjustment covariates were selected with the aid of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) (Supporting Information Figure S1), following current practice in life course
epidemiology, which highlights the risks of overadjustment by factors that might be intermediate in the pathways under consideration, and are therefore not confounders.
Each variable was ordered according to its specific temporal relationship: pre-conception (maternal skin colour; occupation of the head of the family, maternal age and
schooling); antenatal (child’s gender and maternal smoking during pregnancy); perinatal (maternal hypertension at delivery, type of delivery; BMI, length and gestational
age); school age (type of school; BMI and height); adulthood (adult age, occupation of the head of the family; physical activity, smoking, alcohol consumption, sodium
intake; blood pressure, BMI and height). Identifying temporal order facilitates understanding relationship between variables. We then built pathways based on temporality
and theoretical assumptions. The resulting model was built upon these associations in a browser-based environment (http://www.dagitty.net). Adult risk factors for HT

"Confounders for which models were adjusted were chosen based on the assumption that they must be antecedent of exposure and outcome. Since the violence
measurement only encompassed the last 12 months, the independent variables that fulfilled this assumption were maternal schooling, maternal migration, family
socioeconomic status, and being an adolescent mother. Finally, we tested whether the associations could be explained by the presence of maternal risk behaviours, namely
smoking, drinking, inadequate prenatal care, and inadequate weight gain. Stressful events could increase the likelihood of these behaviours, which in turn could affect foetal
development. If the association disappears when these variables are included in the models it means that these variables completely explain the link between mental
disorders/domestic violence and neonate outcomes, since they would be in the pathway between exposure and outcome."

"Before analysing the data we set up a series of causal diagrams to summarize visually the hypothetical relationship between the variables of interest for the research
question, paying special attention to the direction of each arrow and thereby distinguishing confounders and intermediates. The first diagram (Fig. 1) illustrates the pathways
between the different indicators of SES and the outcome and guided which indicators were to be included in the statistical models to obtain total effects. Estimation of total
effects requires adjustment for confounders, but must not include mediators. We represent SES by three primary variables of interest, i.e. education, income, and housing
status. Since education precedes income and housing status temporally, the effect of education on survival is mediated though these two factors; which explains why
models of education will not be adjusted for income or housing status. The association between income and survival is confounded by education, so education will be
included in models investigating income. We further hypothesize that housing status is confounded by education and income. Cohabitation status is regarded as a
confounder when income and housing status are primary variables of interest and as an intermediate when education is investigated, since current cohabitation status
normally follows education temporally. It will thus be included only in models of income and housing status. Furthermore, age, sex and year of operation are confounders of
the association between SES and survival (as illustrated in Fig. 2). To investigate any mediating effect of patient, disease, or treatment factors we calculated the direct effect
of SES on the outcome, which is the effect of SES on the outcome that is not going through the mediator. This was done by controlling the mediator at a constant level by
adjusting for it. We thus obtained an estimate of the controlled direct effect."
"The selection of potential mediators was made on the basis of known prognostic factors potentially unevenly distributed among social groups and the available data in the
database. These included lifestyle, comorbidity, stage of disease at diagnosis, mode of admission, type of operation, specialization of the surgeon, and whether the surgery
was curative. Fig. 2 shows a simplistic diagram including both confounders and categories of mediators. In the diagram we write only SES, instead of income, education or
housing status. Fig. 3 illustrates the hypothetical interrelations between exposure, specified mediators and outcome. As illustrated by the slim arrows mediators may also
affect each other. In the analyses mediators were added stepwise in a series of models. Factors placed more ‘upstream’ in the causal pathway from SES to the outcome
had to be included before the more ‘downstream’ ones. For instance, the ‘upstream’ factor of lifestyle affects the more ‘downstream’ factor of comorbidity, eg. smoking may
cause COPD. Therefore, when investigating any attenuating effect of lifestyle on the association between SES and survival, comorbidity should not be included, since it is
an intermediate. However, when investigating the impact of comorbidity on the association between SES and survival, lifestyle should stay in the model to adjust for
confounding of the effect of comorbidity on survival. Consequently, this allows us to estimate the controlled direct effect of SES on survival, which is not mediated through
lifestyle and/or comorbidity. These considerations are to be transferred to the interrelation of all the mediators and determine their inclusion in the models."

"We adjusted for the possible confounders listed in Table 1 and in Fig. 1. This was done in successive steps, to help understand the effect of various adjustments. We
followed the DAG in a chronological order (prenatal–perinatal–postnatal variable adjustment) by adjusting first for GA using a dummy variable for each gestational week. We
next adjusted for illness severity and other perinatal variables, and then added ventilation, one major antecedent of BPD and other postnatal variables. Ventilation was
subdivided into four categories: no ventilation; ventilation <24 h; ventilation >24 h and <7 day; ventilation >7 days. We also calculated a propensity score for ventilation
(longer than 24 h), to adjust for confounding by indication, that is, attributing to ventilation what should be attributed to factors or covariates that influence the likelihood of
receiving ventilation treatment…To design the propensity score of receiving ventilation, we performed a logistic regression using as independent variables pre- and perinatal
factors (GA, sex, being SGA, twin gestation, location of birth, mode of delivery, Apgar score at 1 min, antenatal steroids and intubation in delivery room). For each infant, the
predicted probability of receiving the treatment was calculated. This probability (propensity score) was used as a covariate in subsequent logistic models that had WMD as
the outcome variable, and BPD, ventilation and other factors, as independent variables…

"If, however, there exists an unobserved factor that causes low GA, and – through other pathways – both BPD and PVL, there will be residual confounding. This scenario
could be represented by a cause of preterm birth (e.g. intrauterine infection/chorioamnionitis) that can cause preterm delivery, and both BPD and PVL by pathways that are
different from those controlled for (see Fig. 2). Under such model (DAG 2), early-onset sepsis, that is not directly linked to either WMD or BPD, could act as a proxy for
intrauterine infection (‘U’ in the graph), so that conditioning on it could help reduce confounding."

based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). The assumption behind the regressions is that adjustment for confounders can create a valid counterfactual substitute for the
comparison of exposed with unexposed members of the target population. A master DAG was created for the outcome of interest; then for each causal factor of interest, the
DAG was reduced to the relevant pathways to identify a minimal set of confounders to be included in the regression. This method identifies parsimonious models and
excludes covariates that should not be entered into the regression lest they introduce bias.”

"We selected confounders using a directed acyclic graph. Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are causal diagrams that illustrate the direction of relationships between variables
of interest and other unknown confounders. They have been suggested as an alternative to traditional epidemiological methods of confounder identification as they explicitly
display and facilitate the causal-inference process. Specifically, in contrast to statistically driven methods of model building, DAGs focus on the theoretical causal
relationships between variables when identifying potential confounders. They are used in epidemiology to identify a confounder set (minimally sufficient set) that will control
for potential confounding between an exposure and an outcome, given the hypothesized causal relationships. We used DAGitty software to create a DAG and identify a
minimally sufficient adjustment set for the association between shift work and overweight and obesity. The DAG is shown in Figure 1; we identified a minimally sufficient
adjustment set that included age and socioeconomic status, the latter as determined by education and family income, and adjusted all multivariate models for these
variables."

"According to our conceptual framework that links social mobility to carotid IMT (Fig. 1), we used a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to ascertain the minimal sufficient
adjustment set of variables for estimating the total and direct effects of social mobility on IMT (Westreich and Greenland, 2013). In theory, a collider variable (i.e., a common
cause of our mediating factors and the outcome IMT) would not be likely in our DAG, allowing us to condition on lifestyle and cardiovascular factors without introducing
collider bias. We used the software DAGitty, available on http://www.dagitty.net/. First, we assessed the association between background characteristics and IMT. Second,
we assessed the association of lifestyle and cardiovascular factors with IMT, adjusting for background characteristics. Then, following our DAG (Fig. 1), we assessed the

association of social mobility with IMT, adjusting for background characteristics (total effect). Next, we added in this model, one at a time, those lifestyle and cardiovascular

"We used the DAGGITY program to construct a causal diagram to determine the necessary confounder adjustments (Supplementary Figure 1). The minimum set of
confounders needed to control for the mediated effect of both triglycerides and CRP were cardiovascular disease, alcohol use, depression, and physical activity. The
minimum set of confounders necessary to control for the total effect of BMI were age, diet, education, and gender."

"To help guide this analysis, we constructed causal diagrams (directed acyclic graph (DAG)) to visually encode the hypothesised relationships between covariates, timevarying exposures and CTS (figure 1A, B), and used them to perform a pathway analysis. DAGs are useful tools to identify potential confounders that may bias observed
exposure–response associations and to distinguish confounders from intermediate variables on the causal pathway for which adjustment is inappropriate."
Page 730:
"Guided by DAGs, the models were adjusted for potential confounding by personal factors related to exposure and outcome that were not on the causal pathway. Using the
forward stepwise procedure, variables were retained in the model if inclusion resulted in a change of the effect estimate of the primary exposure variable by 10% or more17.
Ultimately, age, gender, BMI and study site were included in all models. Models where specific biomechanical exposures were the primary exposure of interest were
adjusted for dissimilar biomechanical exposures (ie, exposures of a different type). 9 For example, the relationship between peak hand force and CTS was adjusted for total
repetition rate and wrist posture, whereas the model assessing the relationship between forceful repetition rate and CTS was only adjusted for wrist posture. Assessment of
confounding of one class of exposures by another (eg, biomechanical, work psychosocial) used the same process and criteria described above."

"We constructed a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to identify confounders and effect modifiers of the relationship between maternal BMI and ever asthma at age 7–8 years,
using DAGitty (S1 Fig). Vectors are created for each expected effect a variable has on other variables. For example: in our cohort, ethnicity is a known predictor for offspring
BMI, so a vector is pointing from ethnicity to offspring BMI. Prepregnancy BMI has been associated with higher rates of pre-eclampsia and preterm birth, higher rates of
caesarean section and extreme high birth weight. Ethnicity and maternal education are correlated and have similar effects. The minimal adjustment set for estimating the
total effect of maternal BMI on ever asthma at age 7–8 years is: non-western ethnicity; maternal age; maternal education; and parental asthma."

"Generally, three sets of models were examined. The first was unadjusted. The second included covariates identified based on a directed acyclic graph (DAG) using the
DAGitty program. The same covariates were included in each model: age, sex, race, smoking, alcohol use, education, income and physical activity. Depending on one’s
causal model, adult BMI could be a confounder (if higher genetic propensity to be large leads to higher birthweight and higher adult BMI) or an intermediate (if intrauterine
undernutrition leads to later adiposity). In the first case, adjustment would be appropriate; in the second, it could in fact create a spurious association. The final set of models
includes the BMI adjustment."

exposure, maternal education, and breastfeeding outcomes. Thus, we adjusted for maternal age and country of birth (coded as Italy, Western Europe and US, or other
countries); region was included as a random effect in multilevel models."

"In order to select appropriate potential confounders, and to make explicit our assumptions about the causal connections between the demographic variables, we drew a
directed acyclical graph, 15 16 or DAG (see Fig. 1) using DAGitty software. The arrows represent assumed causal links. Education and migration status are both ‘past’ and
therefore have been placed higher in the causal pathways; ethnicity is considered conditional on being in the study and therefore migrant status was assumed to be causally
upstream. All of these variables are also thought to have a causal relationship with the outcomes, which is not shown in the diagram. We used the DAGitty software
(http://www.dagitty.net/) to identify minimal sufficient adjustment sets of potential confounders. These confounders were used in logistic regression. By identifying
confounders in this way, as opposed to including potential confounders on the basis of association with the exposure of interest and the outcome, or simply including all
other variables, we aimed to avoid over-fitting the model with variables on the causal pathway in the adjusted models.17 As a result, each of the associations between the
variables and the outcomes was adjusted for by a different set of potential confounders."

variables required to assess the total effect of prepregnancy BMI on development was determined to be demographics, smoking and enrichment."

hospital, neoadjuvant therapy (none, short-course radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy), intraoperative bleeding ( 400 ml or >400 ml), presence of diverting stoma (yes or no)
and type of meso- rectal excision (total or partial). Intraoperative bleeding was categorized using the median as cut-off. To account for the fact that patients operated at the

"To create a multivariable model, we used a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to establish a causal relationship between variables and to find a minimal adjustment set to
minimize bias. Due to the complexity of the causal relationships among all variables associated with AKI, we used the Dagitty tool (Textor et al. 2011) to create the
multivariable model. We chose duration of operation as an exposure variable and AKI as an outcome variable. The Dagitty model showed that BMI, fixation technique,
bilateral operation, and operation type and joint was the minimal sufficient adjustment set to minimize bias. We also included the ASA classifications and preoperative eGFR
in the multivariable model according to clinical experience (see Supplementary data) and because these variables were interesting for our study hypothesis. We performed
a sensitivity analysis that included only the minimal adjustment set to make sure that the results remained unchanged when the ASA classifications and eGFR were added

"To evaluate confounding, we used a directed acyclic graph including the variables of race/ethnicity, age at diagnosis, gender, birth order, exposure to electromagnetic
fields, urbanization, and maternal variables of education, age, and smoking during pregnancy, which was analyzed using DAGitty. The minimally sufficient set of
confounding variables included urbanization, maternal education, and maternal tobacco use during pregnancy. We used backwards selection to quantitatively evaluate
whether covariates changed the odds ratio (OR) > 20% after removal from the model. Because tobacco use was only collected from 1991 forward, we evaluated
confounding among children born from 1991 to 2010 and observed < 10% change in the OR. Therefore, we analyzed the association between benzene and acute leukemia
without tobacco as a confounder using all available data. Furthermore, because it was not clear whether urbanization may be a possible surrogate for socioeconomic status
(SES) (Tselios, 2013) or benzene exposure, we evaluated models with and without urbanization as a potential confounder."

model 2 as well as of lifestyle, SES, and dispositional characteristics (model 3). The results will focus on model 2 as it contains the most relevant variables: Age and sex as

covers influences of a broad spectrum, partly correcting for similar influences twice."

"Analytic approaches were prespecified by using covariates drawn from the scientific literature and Directed Acyclic Graphs (34) to clarify causal relations (Supplemental
Figures 1 and 2, Supplemental Methods). Analyses were implemented separately for rural and urban sites. For the rural site, we analyzed data with the use of a multilevel
logistic regression model with children, mothers, and households (level 1) nested in villages specified as random effects (level 2). We first estimated a model containing only
a random intercept to assess clustering of variance. Model 1 included maternal health literacy as a predictor of the outcomes of interest. Model 2 represented the minimum
adjustment set, adding maternal age and wealth quintile as potential confounding factors. Model 3 included a full set of level 1 covariates (maternal age, parental education,
child’s birth order, child’s age, child’s sex, religion of the household, presence of a toilet facility, and wealth quintile). Model 4 included all model 3 variables and 3 additional
village-level variables (village electrification, proportion of households practicing open defecation, and number of Integrated Child Development Services centers). For the
urban site, we used logistic regression with fixed effects to represent measured and unmeasured sources of neighborhood variation. Models 1, 2, and 3 were otherwise

Several of these sets of confounders (minimally sufficient adjustment sets) were identified from figure 1. The set containing HIV-status, socio economic status, age,
nutritional status and study site was used for analysis, as these variables were available in our data set. Socio economic status was scored on parents’ education, job and
number of assets. Chronic malnutrition defined as height-for-age, SD was used as the marker for nutritional status."

"To select potential confounding variables for our regression models, we employed directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This method provides a graphical approach to causal
modeling which allows one to identify a minimally sufficient set of adjustment variables that will adequately reduce confounding while avoiding adjustment for inappropriate
variables, which may actually induce confounding. To do this, two separate DAGs [one for perinatal (maternal/cord) and one for postnatal exposure] were created. We did
not consider separate DAGs for individual PCB congeners or antibodies as we regarded the causal structure of these models to be similar. Thus, we selected two different
sets of confounders for our models. These were: (1) ethnicity (Roma vs. other), maternal smoking before or during pregnancy (yes/no), and maternal age at child’s birth
(years) for maternal and cord PCB models; and (2) sex, ethnicity (Roma vs. other), maternal smoking at 6 months (yes/no), maternal age at child’s birth (years), and infant
age at the time of 6-month blood draw (days) for 6-month infant PCB models. In secondary analyses, we also adjusted for: child’s age (days) (maternal and cord PCB
models), number of vaccine doses received (1 vs. 2), time since most recent vaccination (days), infant sex (maternal and cord PCB models), and Z-score birth weight, in
addition to those variables already in our primary models formed by the DAG. Variables for our secondary models were selected from other potential confounders reported
in the literature and from variables noted in our DAGs to be predictors of the outcome, but which did not necessarily meet the criteria of a confounder, i.e., were not
associated with PCB concentrations."

trauma exposure (Figure 2). Analyses were partially adjusted for baseline age, baseline sex, and baseline race. Then, analyses were fully adjusted for baseline age,

adjusted for in the regression models (see Results section for further comments on income and occupation). Whereas, we conceptualized medical problems (e.g., heart
problems, diabetes), poor sleep and depression to partially mediate the association between alcohol use and cognitive performance; mediators were not adjusted for in the

smoking during pregnancy, child sex, exclusive breastfeeding duration and the child’s fish intake at age 5 years. We then evaluated additional potential confounders in the
associations of maternal serum-POP concentrations (gestational diabetes, maternal alcohol consumption, type of delivery, year of birth) or child serum-POP concentrations
(year of birth) and the study outcomes in the initial adjusted models using forward selection (i.e., adding one variable at the time in the model). From those covariates, only

neoadjuvant therapy (none, short-course radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy), intraoperative bleeding ( 400 ml or >400 ml), presence of diverting stoma (yes or no) and type
of mesorectal excision (total or partial). Intraoperative bleeding was categorized using the median as cut-off. To account for the fact that patients operated at the same
hospital did not constitute independent observations, the standard errors were adjusted for clustering of patients within hospitals, generally making the confidence intervals
less narrow.”

Model 1 (because of the uncertainty in the direction of the association between BMI and eating disorders); however, the observed results did not differ substantially from the
main analyses. In Model 2 we entered the set of confounders from Model 1 plus additional covariates (e.g., maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms, BMI, weight gain in

"Under the assumption of no unmeasured confounders, the causal DAG shown in Figure 2 presents the association between confounders, exposure and outcome… Both
the exposure and the outcome were measured at two time points (2000 and 2007), whereas a series of baseline confounders were measured in 1993, 1997 and 2000. The
confounders included: caregiver’s age, education and employment status; household size; economic hardship; housing conditions (access to electricity, the main drinking
water source and type of toilet); and place of residence. The use of confounding information measured at three survey rounds allowed for the situations where a child was
raised by a different caregiver, or lived in different housing environments over the course of the study period. This model specification may also help to reduce measurement
error by having multiple indicators over time. In the DAG, the child’s current schooling and caregiver’s mental health in 2000 were included because they indicate the
presence of time-varying confounding so that, given past household PCE, current schooling and maternal mental health predict subsequent exposure and outcome. In
addition, the DAG reflects the proposition that a child’s current schooling affects completion of at least 8 years of education and also affects cognitive function in 2007.
Similarly, caregiver’s mental health in 2000 affects mental health and in turn affects child’s cognitive function in 2007."

mediated by socio-economic status. Age and gender were assumed to be possible confounders of the association between sexual risk behaviour and CT, between socioeconomic status and CT, and between ethnicity and CT."

"To capture sexual risk behaviour, we included the following covariates in multivariable analysis: condom use, number of partners in the preceding year, average duration of

made. Age was instead treated as a confounder in all analyses and gender was treated as a confounder when studying IHD. Because physical activity is not available

influence the primary independent and the dependent variables based on both theorized and documented relationships (see Fig. 1)(37). In all models, confounders included
maternal age (years), marital status (married or living together v. single, widowed, divorced), number of household members (a continuous variable), child’s age (months),
child’s sex, and living with ones’ mother, mother-in-law or sister (as a proxy variable for childcare support)."

"Unter verschiedenen Ansätzen des „machine learning" wählten wir daher das „model-based boosting", das bislang vorwiegend in der Auswertung hochdimensionaler
Daten, wie z. B. genomweiten Assoziationsstudien, eingesetzt wird. Unter mehreren Modellklassen wurde zur Untersuchung der Therapieentscheidung eine binärabhängige Variable ausgewählt. Dadurch können Kovariableneffekte nach Transformation analog zur multiplen logistischen Regression als Odds Ratios (OR) interpretiert
werden. Wir übersetzen Odds mit „Chance" im neutralen statistischen Sinn. Für technische Details von Boosting-Algorithmen verweisen wir auf. In Kürze dargestellt: Die
Variablenselektion erfolgt bei diesem Ansatz implizit. Beginnend mit einem Nullmodell (d. h. ohne Kovariablen), werden sukzessive nur solche Kovariablen hinzugefügt, die
maximal zu einer Modellverbesserung beitragen. Anhand der Reihenfolge der Kovariablenaufnahme ist eine Beurteilung der Relevanz der einzelnen Einflussfaktoren
möglich. Sobald keine Modellverbesserung mehr erreicht wird, stoppt der Algorithmus. Das Stopp-Kriterium der Boosting-Iterationen wurde in dieser Untersuchung mit der
Funktion cvrisk aus dem Programmpaket mboost bestimmt. Um die Variablenselektion gegenüber Stichprobenvariationen zu stabilisieren und damit die Generalisierbarkeit
der Ergebnisse zu erhöhen, wurde das Boosting- Verfahren mit einem Resampling- Verfahren („stability selection") kombiniert."

[We therefore chose "model-based boosting", which has so far been used primarily in the evaluation of high-dimensional data, such as genome-wide association studies,
among various approaches of "machine learning ". Among several model classes, a binary was used to examine the therapy decision -dependent variable selected. As a
result, covariable effects after transformation can be interpreted as odds ratios (OR) analogous to multiple logistic regression. We translate odds with "chance" in a neutral
statistical sense. For technical details of boosting algorithms, we refer to. Briefly presented: The variable selection is implicit with this approach. Starting with a null model
(i.e. without covariables), only those covariates are added that gradually contribute to a model improvement. On the basis of the order of the covariant recording, an
assessment of the relevance of the individual influencing factors is possible. As soon as no model improvement is achieved, the algorithm stops. The stop criterion of the
boosting iterations was determined in this study using the cvrisk function from the mboost program package. In order to stabilize the variable selection against sample
variations and thus increase the generalizability of the results, the boosting method was combined with a resampling method ("stability selection").]

"To avoid bias by adding covariates to the model that are intermediate factors or common effects, directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) were constructed to identify confounding
factors in the association of the exposure (sarcopenia) and the outcome (disability). DAGs allow to identify a minimal adjustment set that contains the smallest set of
covariates needed to estimate the effect of sarcopenia on disability without confounding. Unadjusted and adjusted models were fitted. Analysis was carried out using R
version 3.0.3. DAGs were constructed using DAGitty, a browser-based environment for creating, editing, and analyzing causal models (directed acyclic graphs). The full

"A DAG is a theoretical visualization of a whole causal network that links exposure and outcome. It consists of nodes representing variables (e.g., sarcopenia, disability,

constructed based on previous knowledge, e.g. from literature or from experts. The graph can then be analyzed to determine the minimally sufficient adjustment set using

for multivariable modelling because of too many missing values. We set the p-value for candidate variables eligible for multivariable modeling narrowly to p<0.05 to reduce
the risk of increasing bias and model non-convergence due to too few outcome events per explanatory variable"

level, marital status, individual income level, smoking status, sleep disturbance, noise sensitivity, road traffic noise annoyance and road traffic air pollution as well as
contextual socioeconomic status (see eFigure 1). We considered age and gender as the main adjustment variables which were included in all models. Information on the
remaining variables was obtained either directly from single questions in the survey questionnaire, or combined from several questions (quality of diet, psychological
distress and job strain). Furthermore, information on household mean income in small geographical units with an average population of 1000–2000 individuals was obtained
from registers held by Statistics Sweden and used to account for potential contextual confounding by socioeconomy."

Finally, the fully adjusted model included age (continuous), gender, diet (indices of recommended and non-recommended food scores), alcohol consumption (daily, weekly,
seldom, never), education (primary school, upper secondary school, university education), physical activity during leisure time (sedentary: regular exercise less than 2 h/
week, moderate: regular exercise at least 2 h/week, regular: regular exercise at least 30 min 1–2 times per week, frequent regular: at least 30 min 3 times or more per
week), smoking status (never, former, current), psychological distress (yes/no) and job strain (yes/no), shift work (yes/no), and noise sensitivity (less sensitive than others,
equally sensitive as others, more sensitive than others). In sensitivity analyses, we investigated how the association between road traffic noise and obesity markers was
affected by adjustment for contextual confounding, other sources of noise as well as air pollution from local road traffic. The analyses of contextual confounding were
performed based on mean income in 138 small areas considered homogeneous with respect to socioeconomic characteristics."

affected by both exposure and outcome, leading to spurious associations). We reviewed existing literature and theory about causal relationships and temporal ordering
among patient, health care provider, relationship, and system variables that could affect the relationship between communication and medication refill adherence. We used
established rules for determining the necessary covariates to estimate the direct effect of communication on medication refill adherence (Figure 2). A sensitivity analysis
including number of medications for chronic conditions did not affect the point estimates for our analyses, suggesting that this variable’s exclusion based on the directed
acyclic graph was correct."

"A Direct Acyclic Graph (DAG), a type of causal diagram, was constructed using the DAGitty program in order to improve our understanding of the correlation between
exposure and outcome and all possible confounding factors. According to this program, the minimal sufficient adjustment set for estimating the direct effect of mode of
delivery on plasma adiponectin included birthweight, BP, gestational weight gain, gestational age at delivery and BMI (see S1 Fig, Supporting Information)."
"An additional sensitivity analysis was performed: variables with different distributions between groups of exposure (p < 0.20, according to results of Table 1) were included
in the model one by one. However, none of them changed the magnitude of the effect, the direction of the association, or the level of significance. Consequently, they were
not kept in the final model. "

"A six-step directed acyclic graph (DAG) approach was used for covariate selection to reduce the potential for and degree of bias in effect measure estimation in the final

variables, consideration of association based on a priori expert knowledge is necessary to avoid adjusting for variables that may increase the risk of introducing bias where
none existed. The DAG approach allows for the assessment and incorporation of such knowledge and/or assumptions in the selection of a minimally sufficient adjustment
set of covariates needed to estimate an unbiased effect of neonatal complications on CM. Informed by the DAG covariate selection process and existing literature, race and
marital status were not considered as potential confounding variables and, thus, not included in the final models. Selected covariates were included in our final analysis
models to also attenuate or eliminate any bias that could potentially be introduced in the person time (time to CM event) available for analysis."

"We also try to explore the relationship between paracetamol and antibiotics administration and wheezing by using causal diagrams [directed acyclic graphs (DAG)], a
powerful tool to help answer causal queries."
Page 664 (results):
"In Figure 1, the DAG summarizes possible relationships between the variables, taking into account what is known on this topic. The (confounded) association between
paracetamol/antibiotics and wheeze in the first 2 years of life (persistent wheezing) through infection and fever is shown in the DAG by the arrows from ‘viral infection/fever’
to ‘wheezing P’, and to ‘paracetamol/antibiotics’. According to causal theory, we need not postulate a direct arrow (representing a causal effect) from paracetamol/antibiotics
in the first year to outcomes at the age of 6–7 years, to explain an association, if there are ‘open’ paths between paracetamol/ antibiotics and outcome. In other words, if
there are non-causal (biasing) paths open, a non-null association will be found independently of the true effect of paracetamol/antibiotics. The DAG shows that such paths
exist: [backdoor path ‘paracetamol/antibiotics-infection-wheezing’ at school age]. To block this path and to obtain unconfounded estimates of the association between
paracetamol/ antibiotics and wheeze at school age (if any), we should condition on (stratify for or adjust for) infection"

events (no, yes). For the outcome permanent stoma, adjustment was made for age (<65, 65–75, and >75), ASA class, radiotherapy, and tumor stage (I, II, III, IV). Since
diverting stoma reduces the risk of anastomotic leakage, this variable was not considered a confounder, but rather a mediator of the effect of diverting stoma on the risk of a
permanent stoma."

perioperative bleed was categorised using the median as cut-off. Using this adjustment set, the variables sex and age were redundant and were therefore not included in

account that these patients do not constitute independent observations, therefore making the confidence intervals more conservative."

female age, parity, and partner BMI, whereas for analyses considering the association of couple BMI categories and pregnancy/live birth, we only adjusted for male and
female age and parity because partner BMI was incorporated into the couple BMI category. Our male BMI models did not stratify or adjust by fertilization method
(conventional insemination vs. ICSI) or by infertility diagnosis (male factor) because we considered these factors to be along the causal pathway from BMI to pregnancy/live
birth outcome. For our female BMI models, we did conduct a sensitivity analysis additionally adjusting for reason for infertility treatment (endometriosis, ovulation disorders,
diminished ovarian reserve, tubal disease, uterine disorders, or unexplained infertility) because although these factors are also most likely on the causal pathway between
BMI and pregnancy success, it is possible that they are additionally or alternatively common causes of both BMI and pregnancy success, and thus potential confounders.

"Many risk factors have been suggested to confound the relationship between the number of teeth and mortality (eFig. 1). The most clinically important confounder for the
relationship between unreplaced teeth and mortality is the number of remaining teeth. If the number of remaining teeth is included in the model, additional adjustment for
risk factors for tooth loss may lead to over-adjustment. To reduce a high number of confounders appropriately, causal diagrams are recommended. In many settings, causal
diagrams based on directed acyclic graphs (also known as DAGs) are superior to conventional methods such as the change-in-estimate procedure and could lead to
different confounder sets. Using the number of unreplaced teeth as the exposure, few confounders remained in the following minimal adjustment set: number of teeth, age,
sex, social determinants (education, income, marital status, and partnership), and oral health behaviour. In a series of causal diagrams, the inclusion of the number of
remaining teeth suspended other potential confounders, such as smoking status. For causal diagrams of exposures other than the number of unreplaced teeth, please, see

"We used a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to summarize our prior understanding of the causal relationships between exposures of interest and prediabetes and diabetes. We
then analyzed the DAG using an online tool to identify a minimal sufficient adjustment set (MSAS) of confounders for each exposure of interest. Under the causal
assumptions encoded in the DAG and provided that the regression model for the outcome is correctly specified, adjusting for an MSAS is sufficient to obtain an
unconfounded estimate of the overall effect of each exposure of interest on the outcome, without adjusting away indirect effects via mediators. Predictors included a
traditional cultural beliefs scale (the base question was "How much would you wish these traditions from South Asia would be practiced in America?" and the seven items
included: performing religious ceremonies; serving sweets at ceremonies; fasting on specific occasions; living in a joint family; having an arranged marriage; eating a staple
diet of chapatis, rice, dal, vegetable, and yogurt; using spices for health and healing), socioeconomic status (SES; education and family income), fasting and dietary pattern,
chronic burden and psychological disorders (depression and anxiety), sedentary behavior (time spent watching television) and physical activity (total exercise in metabolic
equivalent-min/wk). Multinomial logistic regression was used to estimate the causal effects of each exposure of interest on pre-diabetes and type II diabetes, adjusting for
the exposure-specific MSAS detailed in the Appendix. All models were further adjusted for study site, a strong independent correlate of these outcomes, and a potential
marker for unmeasured confounding (Appendix)."

terminology, to block backdoor pathways between exposure and outcome via car use and public transport). Weather variables were not included in the main analysis as the

"The identification of confounders was based on a priori knowledge of the association between the variables under study. The diagram is illustrated in Figure 1, to
distinguish: i) exposure-outcome confounders (variables that potentially confound the association between CSES and health and wellbeing in adulthood); ii) exposuremediator confounders (variables that potentially confound the association between CSES and respondents’ education), and; iii) mediator-outcome confounders (variables
that potentially confound the association between respondents’ education and health and wellbeing in adulthood). Age was considered a potential exposure-outcome
confounder, mediator-outcome confounder, as well as an exposure-mediator confounder in all analyses. When childhood financial conditions was used as an exposure,
fathers’ education, mothers’ education and spouse’s education were included in the model as potential mediator-outcome confounders. When mothers’ and fathers’
education were used as an exposure, childhood financial conditions and spouse’s education were included in the model as potential mediator-outcome confounders.
Similarly, mothers’ education was included in the models when fathers’ education was used as an exposure, and fathers’ education was included in the model when
mothers’ education was used as an exposure."

"Significant variables in univariate analyses ( p < 0.05) were entered into multivariate analysis and a prediction model for diabetes was reached by stepwise backward
elimination (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S2). In order to minimize potential bias from intermediate variables when specifically studying the association between FTG
and diabetes, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) approach was used to identify a suitable main final model for adjustments (Tables 3 and 4). The DAG method is designed
to provide suitable models for assessing the causal effect of one variable upon another. Given a list of potential causal relations between the total available set of variables,
the DAG approach selects a set of variables to be included in the model that minimize bias by retaining in the model potential confounders while eliminating intermediate
variables. The main final model identified by DAGs included adjustment for age, FBG, family history of maternal diabetes mellitus and PF. To evaluate the impact of PF
separately, we first adjusted for age, FBG and maternal diabetes (Model 1), and then further for physical fitness. In order to obtain results that could be comparable to
previous studies of triglycerides (TG) and diabetes risk, we also performed additional adjustments for BMI."

"We employed causal diagrams, known as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), to identify variables which could confound the association between cat ownership and psychotic
symptoms. We modelled hypothesized associations between a broad initial set of potential child- and mother-based variables, cat ownership in either pregnancy or
childhood and PEs using the DAGitty web based software. Our DAGs (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2) suggested that it was inappropriate to control for some of these
variables, either because they did not meet criteria for confounding (e.g. child gender, stressful life events, maternal depression, pet ownership other than dogs), or because
adjustment for other variables (e.g. paternal age, dog ownership in pregnancy) provided sufficient control for any other causal paths (e.g. maternal age, dog ownership at
age 4 years). From our DAGs we were able to identify the minimal sufficient number of confounders of the relationship between exposure to cat ownership in pregnancy and
childhood and PEs at ages 13 and 18 years. These included: child ethnicity (white/non-white – including Black African, Black Caribbean, Other Black, Indian, Pakistani,
Bangladeshi, Chinese, Other, mixed); paternal age (at the time of mother’s pregnancy); maternal marital status in pregnancy (single, separated, divorced, or
widowed/married); highest maternal academic education in pregnancy (vocational course/secondary schooling/university degree or higher); maternal social class (manual v.
non-manual profession); number of house moves up to age 47 months (∼4 years); housing type (detached, semidetached semidetached, terraced/flat, other); household

stratifying by metformin dosing intensity (low/high) and by receipt of metformin exclusively or in combination with no metformin ADDs. This process was repeated for overall

"A DAG aided in identifying variables for adjustment, while estimating effect. DAGs are designed to deal with causal chains that may involve multiple interrelated variables
and also to explain and assess the effect of commonly unstated simplifications in research. The use of DAGs has also been recommended to systematically address the
possibility that selected covariates may potentially introduce conditional associations known as collider bias. The DAG of the possible exposure – outcome relationship is
presented in Figure 1. We used the open-access software DAGitty to identify sufficient adjustment sets. Using DAGitty, a DAG explaining the probable exposure – outcome
process was generated and so were minimum sufficient adjustment sets (MSAS) of covariates, which were adjusted for in the final effects model. A multiple logistic
regression model was used to establish the effect in terms of the odds ratio (OR) of romantic relationship status on condom use during vaginal, anal and oral sex in the

outcomes. The minimally sufficient adjustment set was identified using DAGitty v1.0 (www.dagitty.net). All covariates were modeled as categorical variables to allow for nonlinear associations. The categorization of covariates was as follows: maternal age (b24, 25–29, 30–34, and ≥35 years); pre-pregnancy BMI (b25, 25–29.99, and ≥30 kg/m2);
maternal education (less than high school, completed high school, some college, 4 or more years of college); smoking at mid-pregnancy (yes/no), oily fish consumed (0–
3.0, 3.1–7.5, 7.6–14.9, and 15–100 g/day); gestational age at blood draw (12–16, 17–18, 19–20, and 21–37 weeks); nulliparous or most recent inter-pregnancy interval
(nulliparous, 4–23, 24–47, and 48–245 months); and breastfeeding duration in previous pregnancy (nulliparous or b1, 1–5, 6–11, 12–17, and 18–36months). Subjects were
excluded from the analysis if they had missing values for any modeled covariates. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis was performed with the inclusion of weight gain (kg)

completed (<12th grade, high school or GED completed, some college or associate’s degree, four year college, graduate degree), gravidity (any previous pregnancies vs
none). Adjustment for predicted gestational weight gain to 39 weeks was included in secondary models. Additional adjustment for average second trimester BP was
performed as a sensitivity analysis. Separate multivariable univariate linear regression models were constructed to estimate associations of second to third trimester
changes in average systolic and diastolic BP with each of the three body composition variables: neonatal fat mass, fat-free mass and percent fat mass. All previously
mentioned potential confounders, and additionally infant sex and gestational age at birth, were included in the adjusted model. Adjustment for predicted gestational weight
gain to 39 weeks was included in secondary models. We conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the potential for an association between change in average maternal BP
and offspring gestational age at birth. The association between second to third trimester change in maternal BP and gestational age at birth was explored by fitting

indicators of respondent’s childhood socioeconomic status from both the respondent and the parent interviews: Her mother’s educational attainment (less than high school,
general educational development certificate (GED), high school diploma, some college or trade school, or completed college or more), and any household receipt of public
assistance before age 18 (yes/no)… We then used multiple multinomial logistic regression to obtain adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for LBW

"We drew a priori a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and used Pearl’s back-door criterion, as implemented in DAGitty to select a minimal sufficient adjustment set of variables
to control confounding by measured variables, while avoiding selection bias resulting from conditioning on a collider. The DAG (Figure 1) was built by identifying all known
factors affecting side effects or adherence, and then including all common causes of any pair of variables already in the DAG. Pearl’s back-door criterion is based on the
identification of noncausal (backdoor) paths connecting the exposure to the outcome. Noncausal paths must be blocked by adjustment/conditioning to obtain a valid
association between the exposure and the outcome. The resulting minimal sufficient adjustment set included antihypertensive medication class, number of antihypertensive
medications, comorbidity, and use of medications for other diseases as potential confounders. We adjusted for these variables as well as age, sex, and race in all our

age, sex, race, smoking, physical activity, alcohol intake, BMI, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, GFR, BP drug class, lipid medication, and baseline arterial stiffness. Mean
BP was not required as an adjustment factor because the exposure variable ‘BP control status’ was derived from mean BP (e.g. controlled BP was defined as systolic BP of
<140 and diastolic BP of <90mmHg). Carotid distensibility coefficient and YEM were included in separate regression models. Number of visits with controlled BP during
visits 1 to 4 was used as a relevant exposure for change in arterial stiffness between visits 1 and 5."

hr/week) at ages 4 and 7 years. Child sex and exact age were included in all crude and adjusted statistical models. To evaluate whether the assumed relationships and the
minimum adjustment sets provided by the DAGs are supported by our data, we conducted forward and backward 10% change-in-estimate procedures departing from the
minimum adjustment sets following the methods suggested by Evans et al. (2012). The overall DAG of the assumed or known causal relationships between covariates
included in the final models is shown in Supplemental Material, Figure S1."

"We used directed acyclic graphs (DAG) and Pearl’s back-door criterion, as implemented in DAGitty, to select a minimal sufficient adjustment set (MSAS) of variables that
would allow the identification of an unconfounded effect of bilirubin on BP. The DAG (Figure 1) was built by identifying all known factors affecting bilirubin or BP, and then
including all common causes of any pair of variables already in the DAG. Variables in the MSAS blocked all non-causal but not the causal pathway between bilirubin and
BP, and included age, gender, race, abdominal obesity, alcohol use, education (≥high school) and serum creatinine, albumin and uric acid."

"We conducted sensitivity analyses to evaluate the robustness of our results to different assumptions and potential biases. A particularly strong assumption was that an
unconfounded effect of bilirubin on BP could be estimated by adjusting only for those variables in the MSAS. To test this assumption we conducted a calibrated simulation
based sensitivity analysis based on propensity score matching, as proposed by Ichino et al. and implemented by Nannicini. Briefly, we assessed the reasonableness of this
assumption by comparing our estimate of the effect of the bilirubin with estimates that were further adjusted for simulated potential confounders (SPC) drawn from the
distribution of observed variables (see Supplementary for details)."

"We used directed acyclic graphs to guide selection of potential confounding factors to be included in adjusted models. For associations between surgeon or hospital
volume and outcomes (excluding complications), we also fitted models with a continuous propensity score as the only adjustment variable. Propensity scores were
estimated using logistic regression models that included age, sex, state and remoteness of residence, SES, smoking status, family history of cancer, Charlson comorbidity
index, ECOG performance status, TNM stage, positive lymph nodes, tumour differentiation and site, pre-operative WBC count and albumin level, jaundice and weight loss
at diagnosis, any stenting prior to resection surgery and hospital type. We also estimated a propensity score for chemotherapy treatment using the model above but with
preoperative WBC and albumin level omitted and surgeon"

"All models were adjusted for age at diagnosis. We also present HRs and 95% CIs adjusted for state of residence, BMI (in kg/m2; ,18.5, 18.5–24.9, 25–29.9, 30+,
unknown), and smoking status at diagnosis (current smoker yes/no) because causal diagrams (directed acyclic graphs) constructed by using the DAGitty program v2.0
(www. dagitty.net) suggested that inclusion of these variables was sufficient to control for potential confounding by other variables related to serum 25(OH)D (season of
blood collection, time spent outside, physical activity, and diet) and/or survival (histology, grade of disease, and residual disease after surgery)."
"Analyses were performed for the entire study group and also stratified by timing of blood collection (at diagnosis or after the end of treatment and before recurrence).
Because the outcome for women with advanced disease at diagnosis and/or who do not respond to primary treatment is very poor and thus potentially less likely to be
influenced by aspects of lifestyle, we conducted additional analyses stratified by these variables."

"To assess the conditional effects of variables on recent HIV testing, we fitted 3 separate multivariable logistic regression models, where inclusion of covariates was guided
by Poundstone et al’s socioepidemiologic framework, literature review, and causal diagrams (Fig. 1)"
Page 89:
"The first model assessed sociodemographic correlates of HIV testing behavior, variables with a P value higher than 0.3 and did not have a priori research interest were
excluded in subsequent models. Then a second model, restricted to those who reported ever having anal sex with a man, was fitted to assess the conditional effects of
sexual behavioral risk factors associated with recent HIV testing. A third model was fitted to assess psychosocial factors associated with recent HIV testing. Before
modeling, we multiplied and imputed the missing values (n = 188, 35%) on subjective norm toward HIV testing, otherwise complete-case analyses were used for all other
variables and models… To assess whether depression would mediate the association between experiences of homophobia and recent HIV testing, and whether subjective
norms would mediate the relationship between HIV stigma and recent HIV testing, we conducted causal mediation parametric analysis with a counterfactual framework,
which is robust against more modelling misspecifications such as interaction and nonlinearity. Using the STATA command (paramed) developed by Valeri and
VanderWeele, we estimated the natural direct effect (NDE) and the natural indirect effect (NIE) by fitting a logistic regression for HIV testing conditional on experiences of
homophobia and a set of covariates including age, marital status, employment status, hukou, place of residence, and reported condomless receptive anal sex. We then
fitted a linear regression model for depression conditional on experiences of homophobia and the same set of covariates. The same procedure was used for subjective
norms and HIV stigma."

minimal selection of variables to be adjusted for in order to avoid a biased result) was suggested using dagitty.net. This minimal adjustment set included gross household
income, season when the questionnaire was completed, and urbanity. An additional set of variables was considered important to include in the full model because of their
well-established association with exposure and outcome, and because they were well measured (few missing values, registry based, etc.): mother’s education, ethnicity,
siblings in child’s household, and type of residential building."

"Covariates were selected using Directed Acyclic Graphs. DAG is a tool used for covariate selection to minimize the magnitude of bias. Two different DAGs were developed
after an extensive literature review, suggesting the covariates’ associations with exposure and outcome. One DAG was made for the analyses with pregnancy noise, and a
second was made for the analyses with postnatal noise (see Additional files 1 and 2 in supplementary material). Based on the DAGs, minimal adjustment sets (the minimal
selection of variables to be adjusted for in order to avoid a biased result) were suggested using the web based software program dagitty.net. The minimal adjustment set
from the DAG for the postnatal sample included gross household income (continuous; postnatal sample: at age 8 years and five-year average) and urbanity (at age 8/fiveyear average; indicating proximity to city center). An additional set of covariates was considered important to include in the full model because of their well-established
association with exposure and outcome, and because they were well measured (few missing values, registry based, etc.). This would increase the chances that potential
confounders were included (it is unlikely that the inclusion of only two covariates will account for all confounding). The additional covariates included maternal education
(more than 4 years of university/college; less than 4 years of university/college, but more than high school; maximum high school), ethnicity, maternal alcohol consumption
during pregnancy (consumed alcohol once a week or more during either of the trimesters), maternal smoking during pregnancy (smoked sometimes or daily during the last
trimester), prematurity (gestational length of <259 or > = 259 days) and birth weight (> = vs < 2500 g)."
"In addition, air pollution during pregnancy was included in the analyses on the postnatal sample. The minimal adjustment set from the DAG for the pregnancy sample
included the same covariates as listed above, but covering the pregnancy period only. In both samples, inclusion of rail traffic noise and air pollution was limited to sensitivity
analyses."
"A crude model (containing road traffic noise, gender and age), a minimal adjustment set model (adding household income and urbanity), and a full model (further adding
maternal education, ethnicity, maternal alcohol consumption and smoking during pregnancy, low birth weight and prematurity) were fitted."

"We identified potential confounders based on past literature and descriptive statistics from our cohort, using directed acyclic graphs (see Supplemental Figure 1, http://
links.lww.com/QAD/A803) [28–30].We considered the following maternal covariates to be potential confounders: age and race, prepregnancy BMI, chronic health conditions
such as pregestational diabetes, HIV viral load andCD4þ cell counts early in pregnancy, and first trimester substance use (including alcohol, tobacco, and illicit drugs [22]).
In addition, socioeconomic measures were evaluated including household income and caregiver education levels. We descriptively summarized pregnancy outcome [low
birth weight (LBW,<2500 g), preterm birth (<37 weeks gestation) and mode of birth (vaginal or cesarean delivery)] by case status, but our primary analyses excluded these
characteristics and also maternal health measures later in pregnancy, as they may be on the causal pathway given prior evidence of their association with maternal
antiretrovirals."
"Covariates identified a priori as potential confounders and with P<0.20 in unadjusted models for case status were included in initial multivariable models, and those with
P<0.10 and/or which changed antiretroviral exposure estimates by more than 10% were retained in final adjusted models."

"Smoking status was an a priori confounder, and age and sex were considered as a priori effect modifiers. Any variable which was related to both COPD exacerbations and
stroke was included. Other variables were added sequentially. Variables taken forward to the full model were identified using a causal modeling approach, clinical
knowledge, or they were identified from the univariable analysis, having been strongly associated"

"Set of variables to control for confounding was selected using directed acyclic graph (DAG) analysis with DAGitty software (http://www.dagitty.net/). After assessing all
potential confounders, one minimally sufficient subset was found—the number of suspects, the number of customers, and weapon use. The final multivariable models
included this subset."
"Previous research suggests that customer injury risk differs between retail and service businesses. Thus, we evaluated industry type as an effect measure modifier using a
Wald test statistic to specifically evaluate the industry type by employee resistance interaction term. Industry type was not an effect measure modifier at α = 0.15 and
therefore was not treated as an effect measure modifier in this study."
"A sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the potential range of effects of employee resistance on customer injury risk by building two additional models. In the
incidents where the number of customers was unknown, we ran models assuming that all incidents had (1) one or (2) multiple customers present."

"Models were constructed by using published literature and hypothesis-driven a priori assumptions to guide statistical assumptions, then reduced by backward elimination
using P < .15 and <10% change-in-estimate criteria. Models estimating baseline CD4% main effects were adjusted for age, gender, and race. Models estimating age main
effects were adjusted for gender and race. Interactions between immunologic classification and age were assessed and retained in models if P < .15. Models were not
adjusted for adherence or viral failure because both variables are on the causal pathway to CD4% recovery. Adjustment for adherence or viral failure would control for
information unavailable to clinicians when making decisions about treatment initiation and would add bias to estimates. However, we evaluated viral failure to assess the
degree to which immunologic outcomes may be explained by poor viral control. Viral failure was defined as (1) failure to suppress HIV RNA viral load to <400 copies/mL by
week 24 of HAART or (2) after initial viral suppression, viral load >400 copies/mL for 2 consecutive measurements, the first occurring by week 192. Analyses used Cox
models for testing associations and stratified proportional hazards models to estimate adjusted Kaplan-Meier failure probabilities. CD4% main effect estimates were
adjusted for age, continent, and baseline viral load. Age main effect estimates were adjusted for continent."

"We estimated the relative risk (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for lung cancer associated with use of antibiotics compared with nonuse by means of
conditional logistic regression models stratified for age, sex, and calendar year. Other potential risk factors, such as smoking status (current, past, or never smoker by index
date), smoking cessation interventions, episodes of respiratory and urinary tract infection and other types of infection, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), asthma, body mass index (weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), use of other drugs, alcohol intake, and indicators of health care utilization
(e.g., frequency of visits to the general practitioner), were introduced into the multivariate models."
Page 1310:
"Investigators can propose various hypothetical causal networks linking antibiotic use, cancer, and other relevant factors. Diagrams known as directed acyclic graphs can be
used to represent those networks as shown in Figs. 2A to D. The diagrams link variables (nodes) by arrows (directed edges) that represent direct causal effects (protective
or causative) of one variable on another. Directed acyclic graphs are acyclic because the arrows never point from a given variable to any other variable in its past (i.e.,
causes precede their effects) and, thus, one can never start from one variable and, following the direction of the arrows, end up at the same variable. The absence of an
arrow between two variables indicates that the investigator believes that there is no direct effect (i.e., a causal effect not mediated through other variables in the directed
acyclic graphs) of one variable on the other."

"We hypothesise that the total effect of maternal height or parity on perinatal mortality consists of a direct effect and an indirect effect (i.e. an effect mediated by SGA).
However, estimates of direct and indirect effects from standard regression methods with adjustment for intermediate variables can be biased in the presence of an
interaction between SGA and maternal short stature or primiparity. Marginal structural models, using inverse probability weighting for the exposure and intermediate
variables, enables appropriate adjustment for confounding factors, and provides valid estimates of the controlled direct effects for both SGA and non-SGA infants. We
tested interactions between maternal short stature or primiparity and SGA, and estimated total effects and effects independent of birthweight (controlled direct effects) for

both SGA and non-SGA births using marginal structural Cox models. Weights were obtained by estimating two sets of weights, one for short stature or primiparity and one
for SGA, by logistic regression. Weight models included infant sex, maternal age, maternal BMI, mother’s country of birth [Nordic (i.e. Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway
and Sweden) versus non-Nordic], smoking, and maternal education (school years completed)"
"We also estimated controlled direct effects of maternal height and parity on perinatal mortality, mediated by continuous sex-specific EFWGA z-scores in place of
dichotomous SGA, using marginal structural Cox models including a quadratic term for z-scores."
