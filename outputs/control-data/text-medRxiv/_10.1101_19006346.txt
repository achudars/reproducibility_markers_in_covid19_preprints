ABSTRACT
Generic entry of newer anticoagulants is expected to decrease the costs of atrial fibrillation
management. However, when making switches between brand and generic medications,
bioequivalence failures are possible. The objectives of this study were to predict and compare
the lifetime cost-effectiveness of brand dabigatran with hypothetical future generics. Markov
micro-simulations were modified to predict the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years
of patients on either brand or generic dabigatran from a U.S. private payer perspective. Event
rates

for

generics

were

predicted

using

previously

developed

pharmacokinetic-

pharmacodynamic models. The analyses showed that generic dabigatran with lower-thanbrand systemic exposure was dominant. Meanwhile, generic dabigatran with extremely high
systemic exposure was not cost-effective compared to the brand reference. Cost-effectiveness
of generic medications cannot always be assumed as shown in this example. Combined use of
pharmacometric and pharmacoeconomic models can assist in decision making between brand
and generic pharmacotherapies.

INTRODUCTION
Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common cardiac arrhythmia caused by inconsistent
muscle contraction of the atrium. AF increases the risk of systematic embolism, ischemic
stroke and long-term mortality (1-3). Antithrombotic therapy with oral anticoagulants has
been shown to lower the risk of stroke (4, 5). Patients with a high risk of stroke (e.g.
CHA2DS2-VASc score ≥ 2) are recommended to receive long-term anticoagulation (6-9).
Anticoagulation at the same time increases the risk of major bleeding including intracranial
(ICH) and extracranial hemorrhage (ECH) (10). Thus, the risks versus benefits of
anticoagulation and varying treatment options must be considered.
Warfarin, the long-standing mainstay of therapy, has been supplanted by direct oral
anticoagulants (DOACs) as the treatments of choice for stroke prevention in AF. The first
DOAC, dabigatran, (Pradaxa®) was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in
2010. Compared to warfarin, dabigatran was shown to be non-inferior to warfarin with
regards to the prevention of stroke or systemic embolism (11). Furthermore, in that study,
major bleeding was less prevalent in the dabigatran treatment arm (11). Even though DOACs
have been introduced to the market eight years ago and with favorable efficacy and safety
profiles, the cost-effectiveness profiles of DOACs, particularly brand dabigatran, has no
clearly been established due to increased treatment costs. The eventual market entry of
generic DOACs may change market dynamics through increased utilization of cheaper
generic DOACs. As it was first approved, dabigatran is also the first expected generic DOAC,
estimated to enter the market in 2021, which should substantially decrease costs for stroke
prevention in AF.
While the entry of generic dabigatran should be beneficial to both patients and payers
through decreased costs, pharmaceutical and pharmacologic complexity can often raise
concerns regarding bioequivalence (BE) versus the reference brand product (12). Under

current regulations, generic manufacturers need to demonstrate BE to the reference product by
conducting studies on healthy volunteers as a surrogate for therapeutic equivalence (13, 14).
Two pharmacokinetic parameters are often measured in the BE studies — Cmax (maximum
observed concentration) representing the absorption rate, and AUC (Area under the plasma
concentration-time curve) representing the extent of absorption (13, 14). Under US Food and
Drug Administration guidance (15), BE can be declared when the 90% confidence interval for
the ratio of the population geometric means of the pharmacokinetic measures (such as Cmax
and AUC) for generic to brand product falls within 80%-125% or F=0.80 and F=1.25 (Figure
1).
The BE requirement for generic medications assumes that declarations of BE are
consistent with therapeutic equivalence. However, due to batch-to-batch variability and
between manufacturer differences, this may not always hold true. In fact, this phenomenon
has been observed in examples of warfarin brand-to-generic comparisons. One observational
study found international normalized ratios (INR) were significantly lower after switching
from brand to generic warfarin(16). Another study found the number of visits with INR values
outside of therapeutic range and the number of dose changes were higher in patients on
generic warfarin(17). Switching from brand to generic warfarin was associated with a higher
risk of thrombotic events (HR=1.81; 95% CI 1.42 to 2.31) and hemorrhagic events (HR=1.51;
95% CI 1.17 to 1.93)(18). Results from these studies may also call into question the clinical
effects of generic medications and the economic benefits generic medications might bring.
These concerns are especially relevant to anticoagulants due to relatively narrow
therapeutic indices and severity of both safety and effectiveness outcomes (i.e. hemorrhage
and stroke). As dabigatran will be first to be offered as generic, these concerns raise questions
regarding its known PK/PD profile, possible causes of variation in Cmax and AUC, and how
this will impact the entire therapeutic area. Incorporating PK/PD, clinical, and cost

evaluations prior to generic entry may be informative to establish the value proposition of
generic formulations, especially amid situations where some uncertainty in BE and
therapeutic equivalence is predicted. The incorporation of pharmacometric (PK/PD) models
that predict an exposure-response curve based on BE parameters for this application is novel
and a unique application of these approaches.
Thus, the present study aimed to: (1) predict and compare the “pre-launch” lifetime
effectiveness of generic and brand dabigatran; (2) predict and compare the “pre-launch”
lifetime overall medical cost of generic and brand dabigatran; (3) evaluate the “pre-launch”
cost-effectiveness of generic dabigatran versus the reference brand in AF patients. This study
expands upon base pharmacometric models to extrapolate parameters to clinical decisionmaking through cost-effectiveness models.

RESULTS
Base case analysis
In the comparison of brand and hypothetical extreme generic dabigatran, the base case
analysis showed the F=0.8 generic dabigatran had the highest effectiveness (QALYs) among
the three versions followed by the brand dabigatran (Table 2). While the occurrence of stroke
was similar across different versions of dabigatran, more variability was observed with
bleeding events which was consistent with the predicted bleed and stroke rates from the
PK/PD models. The cohort on the F=1.25 generic had an excess of roughly 2,000 more
(14,112 vs. 12,193; 15.7% increase) bleeding events than the brand dabigatran and roughly
3,500 more (14,112 vs. 10,604; 33.1% increase) bleeding events than the F=0.8 generic
dabigatran (Table 2). The F=0.8 generic dabigatran had the lowest cost among the three
dabigatran treatments followed by the F=1.25 generic. The F=0.8 generic had both higher

QALY and lower costs; thus, it dominated the other treatment options. Direct comparison
between the F=1.25 and brand dabigatran showed the brand to be more cost-effective than the
F=1.25 generic with an ICER value of $36,483/QALY.
The comparison of brand and less extreme hypothetical cases of generic dabigatran
versions showed consistency in that the F=0.9 generic dabigatran was dominant with the
highest effectiveness (QALYs) and the lowest cost (Table 3). The difference in the occurrence
of clinical events was also less extreme. Similar to the other comparison, the occurrence of
stroke event was almost the same across three dabigatran treatment groups. The cohort on the
F=1.125 dabigatran had an excess of roughly 1,000 more (13,167 vs. 12,125; 8.6% increase)
bleeding events than the brand dabigatran and nearly 1,800 more (13,167 vs. 11,391; 15.6%)
bleeding events than the F=0.9 generic dabigatran (Table 3). Direct comparison between
brand and F=1.125 generic dabigatran showed the brand retained more utility than the
F=1.125 generic version but with a much higher ICER of $287,200/QALY compared to the
more extreme generic (F=1.25).
Sensitivity analyses
One-way sensitivity of the comparison between brand and extreme generic dabigatran
versions showed the F=0.8 generic was the optimal treatment option under all tested
conditions. While results from direct comparison between brand and F=1.25 dabigatran was
robust to most of the parameter changes, F=1.25 generic was more cost-effective than the
brand at a WTP threshold of $50,000/QALY in the following cases:
o Monthly cost of generic dabigatran lower than $248 (Figure 4A)
o HR for ECH comparing dabigatran to warfarin was < 1.04
o MI rate for patients on warfarin < 1.06
o HR for MI comparing dabigatran to warfarin < 1.27 or > 1.85
o HR for ICH comparing dabigatran to warfarin < 0.33.

F=1.25 generic was also more cost-effective than the brand at a WTP threshold of
$100,000/QALY in the following situation:
o Monthly cost of generic dabigatran lower than $207 (Figure 4B)
o HR for ECH comparing dabigatran to warfarin was < 0.91 (Supplementary Figure S7).
Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the F=0.8 was the most cost-effective treatment
option among the three in 100% of the iterations (Supplementary Figure 15).
One-way sensitivity of the comparison between brand and less extreme generic
dabigatran showed F=0.9 generic was the optimal treatment option under all tested conditions
(Supplementary Figure S8-S11). Results from the direct comparison between brand and
F=1.125 dabigatran were robust to most of the tested conditions (Supplementary Figures S12S14). Probabilistic sensitivity analyses showed that the F=0.9 was the most cost-effective
option among the three in 99% to 100% of the iterations depending on the WTP threshold
used (Supplementary Figure S16).

DISCUSSION
The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of hypothetical
generic versions of dabigatran versus the brand. Two comparisons were conducted based on
two assumptions of generic dabigatran systemic exposure—extreme cases (F=0.8 and F=1.25)
and less extreme cases (F=0.9 and F=1.125). Our model shows that the generic dabigatran
with the lower-than-brand systemic exposures (F=0.8 and F=0.9) were the most cost-effective
options in both comparisons with the highest QALY and lowest cost. However, as expected,
the QALY difference between F=0.8 generic and brand was a minimal 11 days. The
difference between F=0.9 and brand was an even smaller 7 days. The results are robust in that

in the base case analysis and across all sensitivity analyses including probabilistic sensitivity
analysis, F=0.8 and F=0.9 generic dabigatran were the optimal treatment strategies.
When the dominant treatment strategies (F=0.8 and F=0.9 generic dabigatran) were
excluded, and only F=1.25 and F=1.125 generic dabigatran were compared with the brand,
our model showed different results in two comparisons. In the extreme case, brand was more
cost-effective than the F=1.25 generic, while in the less extreme case, F=1.125 generic was a
preferred choice than the brand. The discrepancy between two comparisons could be
explained by the smaller QALY difference in the less extreme case (4 days) than the QALY
difference in the extreme case (22 days). The results are robust to most tested conditions.
Note that the price of generic dabigatran was estimated from a previous study (19)
under the assumption that there is only one generic dabigatran available (generic costs 87% of
the brand). The same study also reported the generic to brand price ratio when there are
multiple generic medications available. Based on their estimations, when there are two
generic dabigatran on the market, the generic dabigatran would have a price of $228 USD (i.e.
77% of the brand price). Under this scenario, the brand will no longer be cost-effective than
F=1.25 generic dabigatran brand using a WTP threshold of $50,000/QALY but remained
cost-effective using a WTP threshold of $100,000/QALY. However, when there are three
generic dabigatran available, generic dabigatran would have an estimated price of $178 USD
(the generic costs 60% of the brand). Under that scenario, the brand will no longer be costeffective than the F=1.25 generic dabigatran using either $50,000 or $100,000 WTP
threshold. Thus, these results, and the cost-effectiveness of generic dabigatran in extreme
cases of increased bioavailability, may depend on competition and pricing of generics.
Anticoagulation as a therapeutic area has experienced past concerns about BE failures
when generic versions of warfarin became available. Studies comparing brand and generic
warfarin found decreased anticoagulation control, increased healthcare visits required to

manage anticoagulation, and increased thrombotic and haemorrhagic events (16-18).
Concerns with warfarin were due to its narrow therapeutic index – a concern that is lessened
with DOACs. However, DOACs still have PK/PD profiles that can be of concern, particularly
for bleeding events, which drove the major findings in this study. The choice of dabigatran as
an example of combining pharmacometric parameters with CEA was motivated by
convenience and projections of it being the first generic DOAC. This study does not
necessarily imply that dabigatran has complex pharmaceutical or pharmacological properties
that may lead to BE concerns or predict future product failures. However, dabigatran does
have low bioavailability and is susceptible to drug-drug interactions. Paired with a relatively
steep bleed risk curve with increasing bioavailability, the results of this study indicate that an
increase in bioavailability of dabigatran, whether caused by formulation issues or drug-drug
interactions, can lead to excess bleed events and lack of overall cost-effectiveness.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the cost-effectiveness
of future, hypothetical generic formulations versus the brand using pharmacometrically
derived input parameters (20). The results have important clinical implications. Such an
approach, and the evidence generated, could enhance evaluation of generics by patients,
providers, and healthcare payers with regards to generic medications. Combined, PK/PD
models and pharmacoeconomic models can also be informative for regulatory bodies for the
required evidence for generic approval (20). From a clinical standpoint, this study highlighted
the clinical burden when the active ingredient of generic dabigatran was above that of the
brand and demonstrated it was less of the concern when active ingredient of generic
dabigatran was below that of the brand. Future studies which evaluate the cost-effectiveness
of other generic medications with more complex pharmaceutical properties may be
informative to healthcare providers and decision makers.

Limitations
These results should be interpreted in light of a number of limitations. Effectiveness and
safety estimates were obtained from clinical trials and further parameterized with external
information from PK/PD models and may not be generalizable to real-world populations.
Transition probabilities were further influenced by external information. To account for
indirect evidence, we incorporated meaningful ranges and thorough one-way and probabilistic
sensitivity analyses to observe the robustness of results amid this uncertainty. Like past costeffectiveness models in AF, the model incorporates a time span much longer than the source
material and does not incorporate additional incident events such as diabetes which would
influence stroke and bleed risk scores. However, these events can generally be considered to
be similar between treatment groups.

Conclusion
Predictions of cost-effectiveness for future generic dabigatran products showed that lowerbound generics (F=0.80 bioavailability versus brand) was consistently cost-effective. Upperbound generics (F=1.25 bioavailability versus brand) were not cost-effective, mainly due to
an excess in bleeding events, though these results were sensitive to the cost of the generic
version. Future generic DOACs should be more closely evaluated for sensitivity in
bioavailability related to formulations and pharmaceutical parameters as these differences can
lead to poor patient outcomes. Extensions of pharmacometric PK/PD models to costeffectiveness and decision analyses can be informative for multiple stakeholders and provide
insight into current or future value of generic medications.

METHODS
Economic model overview
A Markov model was adapted from Shah et al. to model the disease progression of AF
(Figure 2 and 3) (21). We relaxed the cohort assumption inherent with Markov models to
allow variations in patient clinical characteristics such as stroke and bleed risks and age. The
model had a cycle length of 30 days with a lifetime horizon. The simulation was conducted
from the U.S. private payer perspective. All state rewards including probabilities, costs, and
health utilities were converted to reflect the 30-day cycle length. The half-cycle correction
(HCC) was applied to adjust for the potential overestimation of the costs and utilities. The
study population represented commercially insured adult patients with AF who are eligible to
receive anticoagulants. The model population consisted of 10,000 AF patients aged 18 or
above recommended for anticoagulation with a CHA2DS2-VASc score of 2 or above(22) and
any value of HAS-BLED score(8, 22).
We updated the prior model to expand granularity for stroke and bleed risk estimates.
We replaced the CHADS2 score with CHA2DS2-VASc score which has been shown to
perform better in risk stratification(23, 24). We also incorporated individual bleed risk using
the HAS-BLED score(25). Patients were grouped into nine exclusive subgroups based on the
cross-tabulation of their stroke risk categories (low, moderate or high) and bleed risk
categories (low, moderate, high). The joint distribution of CHA2DS2-VASc and HAS-BLED
scores, as well as the age distribution for the nine subgroups, were derived from IBM
MarketScan® Databases, which was consistent with the commercial payer perspective of the
model.
Clinical outcomes considered in the model were minor bleeding, stroke, ICH,
myocardial infarction (MI), ECH, and death. The model structure consisted of twelve
mutually exclusive health states: (1) Well with AF; (2) Reversible ischemic neurological

damage (RIND); (3) Minor stroke; (4) Major stroke; (5) Major ICH; (6) Minor intracranial
ICH; (7) Minor stroke on aspirin; (8) Major stroke on aspirin; (9) Stroke and ICH; (10)
Myocardial infarction (MI); (11) Extracranial hemorrhage (ECH) and (12) death. Patients
entered the model in the “Well with AF” state on either brand or generic dabigatran and then
transitioned to other health states based on the event transition probabilities. The following
assumptions were made to reflect the actual treatment pattern of AF patients and to better
approximate the disease progression of AF patients:
•

28% of all the ischemic strokes were transient ischemic attacks, the remaining could
be 1 of 4 types: reversible, major, minor, or fatal;

•

ICH could be of 3 types: major, minor, and fatal. ECH could be either fatal or nonfatal. After experiencing ECH or ICH, patients were assumed to discontinue
dabigatran and switch to aspirin for the remainder of their life;

•

After experiencing two major neurological events (stroke or ICH), patients will
proceed to the death state;

•

After experiencing two minor neurological events, patients will proceed to a major
neurological event state.

For example, if patients in “major ICH” state experience a major stroke, instead of entering
“major stroke” state, they will enter “death” state. If patients in “minor ICH” state experience
another minor ICH, they will enter “major ICH” state instead of staying in “minor ICH state”.
To estimate the net monetary benefits, we used two different willingness-to-pay (WTP)
threshold of $50,000 and $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Costs and utilities
were discounted at a rate of 3%.
Two sets of comparisons were performed. First, we compared brand dabigatran
(F=1.0) with two hypothetical versions of generic dabigatran with extremes in systemic
exposure based on AUC and Cmax. The two extreme generic dabigatran versions had,

respectively, 80% systemic exposure of the brand (extreme lower-bound generic, F=0.8) and
125% systemic exposure of the brand (extreme higher-bound generic, F=1.25). Second, we
compared brand dabigatran with two additional hypothetical dabigatran versions with less
extreme values of BE, 90% and 112.5% (F=0.9 and 1.125, respectively). Figure 1 shows the
brand to generic ratio of systematic exposure for the hypothetical generic dabigatran we
compared in this study.
Model input parameters
Key model input parameters are provided in Table 1and a complete list of all input
parameters, distributions, and data sources are provided in Supplementary Table S1. All costs
were considered from a private payer’s perspective and only direct medical costs were
included. The event costs of ICH, MI, stroke, and ECH and the follow-up costs of ICH, MI,
and stroke were derived from AF-specific event and follow-up cost estimates. The cost for the
branded dabigatran was estimated using the 2017 National Average Drug Acquisition cost
compiled by the US Medicaid program(26). The cost for the generic dabigatran was
calculated by multiplying the price for brand dabigatran by the reported relative cost
difference between branded and generic drugs when only one generic drug is available(19).
To more accurately reflect a payers’ perspective in which negotiated rebates are common
when there are multiple branded products in a therapeutic category, we applied an average
rebate of 23% to the price for both brand and generic dabigatran. All event and follow-up
costs were inflated using the medical component of Personal Consumption Expenditures Price
Index (PCEPI) to 2017 US dollars (27). The cost for aspirin was inflated using the
pharmaceutical product component of PCEPI.
Utilities were accounted in each state and with each event to estimate cumulative
QALYs for each patient. State utilities (state rewards) were attached to the 12 health states.
Major and minor neurological events (stroke or ICH) were associated with a permanent

annual disutility of -0.61 and -0.24, respectively. The decrements in utilities (transition
rewards) were calculated for the transitional events (minor bleed, RIND, ECH and MI) in the
model. MI, ECH and minor bleed were assigned temporary disutility of 30 days, 2 weeks, and
2 days, respectively. The detailed calculation of state utilities for the 12 health states and the
transition utilities for the transitional events are shown in Supplementary Table S2.
The ischemic stroke and bleeding rates (minor bleeding, ICH, and ECH) for patients
on brand dabigatran within each CHA2DS2-VASc score category were derived from IBM
MarketScan® Databases and the RE-LY trial(11). The difference in event rates (stroke and
bleeding) between generic and brand dabigatran were obtained from the PK/PD model
developed by Kim et al. by calculating a relative event rate for each bioavailability level (e.g.
F=0.8 and F=1.25)(28). Relative risks for increased stroke and ICH with every decade were
based on pooled analysis from clinical trials and systematic reviews. The MI rate for patients
on brand dabigatran was obtained from the clinical trial. The difference between brand and
generic in MI rate was approximated from a meta-analysis comparing 150 mg dabigatran to
110 mg dabigatran, which assumed a linear relationship between dabigatran dose and
occurrence of MI(29). The calculations of the event rates and the data analysis were
conducted in IBM MarketScan® Databases and are described in detail in the supplementary
materials.
Two cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) were performed to compare extreme generics
and more BE generics each to the brand dabigatran. We performed a series of one-way
sensitivity analysis by varying (1) cost of generic dabigatran; (2) the event and monthly costs;
(3) the utilities; (4) the transition probabilities. The parameter ranges for one-way sensitivity
analysis are shown in supplementary table S1. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis (PSA) was
conducted to account for parameter uncertainty. The probability distribution reflected the
nature of the data. When the simulation was initiated, a value for each input was randomly

iterations and the pooled results were summarized. Model development, implementation, and
analyses were performed using TreeAge Pro 2018 (TreeAge Software Inc., Williamstown,
MA, USA).

have complex pharmaceutical or pharmacological properties. Projecting the impact of
variations in pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics and incorporating these parameters
into cost-effectiveness models could inform clinical decision-making.

What question did this study address?
•

This study considered whether or not generic versions are always cost-effective in
light of bioinequivalence concerns. These analyses modelled hypothetical dabigatran
generic versions using extreme values of bioequivalence thresholds and predicted
event probabilities.

What does this study add to our knowledge?
•

With dabigatran as an example, this study showed that generic medications are not
always cost-effective when bioequivalence thresholds are considered. While the
generic dabigatran with less extreme systemic exposure is cost-effective compared to
the brand reference, generic dabigatran with extremely high systemic exposure is not
cost-effective compared to the brand reference.

How might this change clinical pharmacology or translational science?

•

This study implies that generic medications with complex pharmaceutical or
pharmacological properties should be more closely scrutinized, not only by regulatory
bodies, but also once on the market by prescribers and patients. This study also is
indicative of the value of multidisciplinary and translational science to inform
pharmacotherapy through the combination of pharmacometric and pharmacoeconomic
approaches.
