Abstract
Purpose: Researchers often analyze cancer registry data to assess for differences in
survival among cancer treatments. However, the retrospective non-random design of
these analyses raise questions about study validity. The purpose of this study was to
determine the extent to which comparative effectiveness analyses using cancer registry
data produces results concordant with randomized clinical trials.

Methods: We identified 141 randomized clinical trials referenced in the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines for 8 common solid tumor
types. For each trial we identified subjects from the National Cancer Database (NCDB)
matching the eligibility criteria of the randomized trial. With each trial we used three Cox
regression models to determine hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival including
univariable, multivariable, and propensity score adjusted models. Multivariable and
propensity score analyses controlled for potential confounders including demographic,
comorbidity, clinical, treatment, and tumor-related variables. Each NCDB survival
analysis was defined as discordant if the HR for the NCDB analysis fell outside the 95%
confidence interval of the corresponding randomized trial.

Results: NCDB analyses produced HRs for survival discordant with randomized trials in
62 (44%) univariable analyses, 43 (30%) multivariable analyses, and 51 (36%)
propensity score models. NCDB analyses produced p-values discordant with
randomized trials in 83 (59%) univariable analyses, 76 (54%) multivariable analyses, and
78 (55%) propensity score models. We did not identify any clinical trial characteristic

associated with discordance between NCDB analyses and randomized trials including
disease site, type of clinical intervention, or severity of cancer.

Conclusion: Comparative effectiveness research with cancer registry data often
produces survival outcomes discordant to randomized clinical data. These findings help
provide context for providers interpreting observational comparative effectiveness
research in oncology.

Introduction
Randomized clinical trials in oncology represent the gold-standard level of
evidence from which we establish efficacy of different therapeutic approaches 1. Despite
the critical importance of randomized trials, this study design has acknowledged
limitations related to cost, timeliness, and generalizability of results in a “real-world”
oncology population2-4. Additionally, several clinical scenarios encountered within
oncology lack randomized data to support clinical decisions. To help fill these evidence
gaps especially in pressing situations, investigators will often rely on research using nonrandomized observational data.
Cancer registries within the field of oncology represent a unique resource to study
questions surrounding the comparative benefits of different cancer therapies. Cancer
registries collect detailed data on incident cancer diagnoses across a substantial portion
of the United States (US) population5-7. These resources play a critical role in the study
of cancer incidence, prevalence, disparities, and patterns of care across the US.
However, researchers have increasingly used cancer registry data to evaluate the
comparative efficacy of different cancer treatments. The accessibility, ease of use, large
sample sizes, and “real world” nature of cancer registry data are attractive for
comparative effectiveness research. However, one must also consider potential
limitations of using these data for comparative effectiveness research. These include
concerns about accuracy with data collection8, rigor of analytic techniques9, or the
potential for selection bias10. Together, these limitations could skew results and threaten
the validity of comparative effectiveness research with cancer registry data.

Within the field of oncology, we lack a clear understanding of how the survival
outcomes of comparative effectiveness research with cancer registry data compare to
the gold-standard randomized clinical trials. An improved understanding of this
relationship would help providers, researchers, and other consumers of medical literature
better assess the role of observational research in the comparative effectiveness
landscape. The purpose of this study was to measure agreement (or concordance) in
survival estimates between existing randomized clinical trials and comparative
effectiveness research with cancer registry data. Furthermore, we sought to identify
features of clinical research questions that lead comparative effectiveness research with
cancer registry data to more closely align with results of randomized clinical trials.

Methods
This study identified randomized clinical trials from the literature and compared
their survival outcomes to outcomes of patient cohorts systematically analyzed from the
National Cancer Database (NCDB). We included common cancer sites including central
nervous system, head and neck, breast, lung, gastrointestinal (anal, esophageal, gastric,
pancreas, and colorectal cancers), genitourinary (bladder, kidney, and prostate cancers),
gynecologic (uterine and cervical cancers), and lymphoma. This study was deemed
exempt from institutional review board approval.

Randomized Clinical Trials
We systematically identified randomized clinical trials referenced in the National
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines for each individual

disease site11-27. The NCCN Guidelines represent comprehensive tumor site-specific
evidence-based consensus-driven guidelines which describe current treatment
recommendations. They also include a comprehensive written discussion describing in
detail the clinical evidence supporting these recommendations. From the NCCN
guidelines we extracted 7,969 referenced publications, and reviewed these references to
identify therapeutic randomized clinical trials involving surgery, systemic therapy,
hormonal therapy, or radiation therapy. In scenarios where a clinical trial results were
reported in more than one publication (typically an “original” publication followed by an
“update” at a later date) we kept the most recent publication. Figure 1 demonstrates our
clinical trial selection process, with additional exclusion criteria noted below.

National Cancer Database
The NCDB represents a nationwide facility-based cancer registry sponsored by a
collaboration between the American College of Surgeon’s Commission on Cancer and
the American Cancer Society. Trained tumor registrars at individual facilities record
patient demographic, tumor, and treatment-related information on all incident cancers
diagnosed at that facility. Specific information recorded includes tumor, node, metastasis
(TNM)-stage, tumor histology, grade, as well as details of treatment including surgery
(site, extent of surgery, open vs. laparoscopic) and radiation therapy (dose, number of
fractions, treatment modality). Additionally, NCDB records the use of chemotherapy,
hormonal therapy, and immunotherapy, though it does not report information on specific
agents. Charlson comorbidity score is measured the year prior to diagnosis28. This study
included patients within NCDB diagnosed between 2004 and 2014.

Analysis
With each randomized clinical trial we created a cohort of NCDB patients that
matched the eligibility criteria of the trial whenever possible. We restricted each NCDB
cohort to the disease site in question, histologic confirmation of malignancy, TNM stage
per trial eligibility, patient age ≥18 years of age, and no prior history of malignancy. We
further restricted each NCDB cohort to select subjects receiving treatments delivered in
each clinical trial. For example, if a randomized trial in breast cancer evaluated the
impact of mastectomy alone compared to lumpectomy followed by radiation we would
include only NCDB patients with a mastectomy alone or those treated with a lumpectomy
followed by radiation therapy. Due to a lack of available data on specific systemic
agents, we were unable to include clinical trials comparing single-agent systemic
regimens to multi-agent systemic regimens, or clinical trials evaluating two different
systemic agents. We did include randomized trials where one arm contained a systemic
agent and the other arm did not, with the limitation that the specific agent used was
unknown. Randomized clinical trials often have eligibility criteria which include patient
performance status or baseline laboratory values. Similar to other cancer registries,
NCDB does not contain performance status or laboratory data, therefore these factors
were not considered in our analysis. For trials involving radiation therapy, we restricted
radiation doses to within 10 Gy of the trial specified dose. If the trial specifically
compared two different radiation doses, we restricted the NCDB cohort to the specified
dose and number of fractions delivered in the trial. Within the NCDB cohorts we defined

chemotherapy delivered concurrently with radiation if the start dates for both modalities
occurred within 14 days of each other.

Statistical Analysis
Of the randomized clinical trials included in this analysis we recorded the hazard
ratio for overall survival along with the 95% confidence interval and associated p-value.
For trials that did not present a hazard ratio for overall survival in the manuscript we
estimated the hazard ratios from Kaplan-Meier plots29. With each cohort of NCDB
patients, we determined hazard ratio for overall survival using three different analytic
approaches including: 1) unadjusted univariable Cox proportion hazards model; 2)
multivariable Cox proportional hazards model; and 3) propensity score adjusted analysis.
All models measured survival from the date of diagnosis through death of any cause,
censoring at the date of last follow-up. We conducted a sensitivity analysis measuring
survival from the date of treatment initiation, which did not influence our results (analysis
not presented). Multivariable models included known confounding variables available in
NCDB which could potentially influence survival. At a minimum each multivariable model
included patient age, gender, race, geographic region, median household income,
Charlson Comorbidity score, year of diagnosis, grade, site-specific histology, and clinical
or pathologic TNM stage. Individual multivariable models included additional factors
related to specific disease sites, including ER/PR/HER2+ status for breast cancer, as
well as prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Gleason score for prostate cancer. With the
propensity score analysis for each NCDB cohort, we derived propensity scores from
logistic regression models using the same covariates noted above in the multivariable

analyses. With each propensity score analysis we used inverse probability of treatment
weighting, and assessed balance between weighted covariates with standardized
differences.
We assessed concordance between the randomized clinical trials and
corresponding NCDB analyses using three different approaches. First, we assessed the
relationship between hazard ratios for overall survival between the clinical trial and
NCDB analysis with a Pearson correlation coefficient, with a score of 0 indicating no
correlation, and 1 indicating perfect correlation. Second, we assessed concordance in
hazard ratios with an NCDB analysis considered concordant if the NDCB hazard ratio fell
within the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio from the clinical trial 30. Third, we
considered concordance with respect to statistical significance, with an NCDB analysis
considered concordant if both the NCDB and clinical trial p-values for survival were nonsignificant (p>0.05), or if they were both significant (p<0.05) with survival favoring the
same treatment arm in NCDB and the clinical trial.
Univariable logistic regression was used to identify whether certain features of a
clinical trial would lead to higher levels of concordance in hazard ratios between the
clinical trial and NCDB analysis. We analyzed the following features: domestic versus
international trial, year of trial publication, tumor site, type of clinical trial question
addressed, difference in mean age between NCDB treatment arms, and aggressiveness
of cancer (assessed with the proxy of median survival of study population). We also
addressed the impact of trials with treatment arms of different durations to indirectly
address the influence of immortal time bias 31. A study was defined susceptible to
immortal time bias if one treatment arm included lengthier treatment than the other

treatment arm. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC), with p-values less than 0.05 considered statistically significant.

Results
One hundred and forty-one randomized clinical trials met inclusion criteria (Figure
1), with characteristics of the studies provided in Table 1, and a complete list of trial
references provided in Supplemental Table 1. In general, the majority of clinical trials
were published between 2004 and 2014, took place outside North America, and the trials
addressed an array of clinical questions though nearly half evaluated the utility of adding
systemic therapy to surgery or radiation. In total the clinical trials included 85,118
patients whereas the corresponding NCDB analyses included 1,344,536 patients. The
median size of a clinical trial was smaller than the median size of an NCDB analysis (396
patients vs. 6,543 patients).
When considering all clinical trials, we found a weak correlation between the
hazard ratios (HRs) from the clinical trials and the HRs from the NCDB analysis for all
three statistical approaches (Figure 2). The correlation between the HR from the clinical
trials and NCDB was weakest with the unadjusted analysis (r=0.20; 95% confidence
interval [CI]=0.03-0.35, p=0.02), followed by the propensity score analysis (r=0.25; 95%
CI=0.09-0.40, p=0.003), and followed by the multivariable analysis (r=0.34, 95%
CI=0.18-0.48, p<0.001).
When evaluating concordance in hazard ratios for overall survival we found that
62 of 141 trials (44%) evaluated in NCDB with a univariable analysis produced hazard
ratios discordant with compared to clinical trials. With multivariable analysis, 43 trials

(30%) analyzed in NCDB produced hazard ratios discordant with randomized trials. With
propensity score analysis, 51 trials (36%) analyzed in NCDB produced hazard ratios
discordant with randomized trials. Supplementary Figure 1 demonstrates results of all
clinical trials in the analysis.
When evaluating discordance with statistical significance we found that 83 trials
(59%) analyzed with a univariable analysis, 76 trials (54%) analyzed with a multivariable
analysis, and 78 trials (55%) analyzed with a propensity score analysis produced pvalues discordant with clinical trials (Table 2). Forty-nine clinical trials found one
treatment arm to have significantly improved survival, yet NCDB analysis found
discordant p-values in 21 trials (43%) analyzed with a univariable analysis, 19 trials
(39%) analyzed with a multivariable analysis, and 19 trials (39%) analyzed with a
propensity score analysis. Ninety-two clinical trials found no significant difference in
overall survival between treatment arms, yet NCDB found significant p-values in 62 trials
(67%) analyzed with univariable analysis, 57 trials (62%) analyzed with a multivariable
analysis, and 59 trials (64%) analyzed with a propensity score analysis.
Analysis to identify individual predictors of discordance did not find any factor
associated with discordance in hazard ratios for overall survival between NCDB and
clinical trials (Figure 3).

Discussion
This study demonstrates substantial discordance and little correlation between
survival outcomes of randomized clinical trials and comparative effectiveness research
using cancer registry data. Multivariable models and propensity score analyses improved

concordance modestly, yet approximately one-third of clinical trials replicated with cancer
registry data produced overall survival outcomes discordant with clinical trials.
Furthermore, this study did not identify factors associated with the clinical research
question which might help identify cancer registry research studies more or less in line
with the results of randomized clinical trials.
These findings complement other research in oncology30 and non-oncology
fields32-34 which evaluates differences in outcomes between randomized clinical trials
and observational research. Within oncology, Soni et al. recently published a study using
different methodology comparing the results of published comparative effectiveness
research to published randomized clinical trials30. Soni found that 38% of analyses with
cancer registry data produced survival results discordant with clinical trial data, whereas
our study found discordance rates between 30-44% depending on the analytic method.
Our study methodology differed from Soni in that we used a standardized and consistent
approach to analyze the cancer registry data as opposed to extracting results from the
literature which used more heterogeneous analytic approaches. Regardless, these
analyses together suggest that a substantial portion of comparative effectiveness
research using cancer registry data may produce results that differ substantially from
randomized clinical trials.
Our analysis of statistical significance found discordance between observational
cancer registry research and clinical trial outcomes, though one must consider that
calculations of statistical significance depends exquisitely on sample size. Therefore, the
larger number of patients within cancer registries inherently leads to a higher likelihood
of a lower p-value. Despite this issue, one must also consider that physicians frequently

misunderstand the basic concepts of p-values35,36. Furthermore, the overall utility of the
p-value in research represents an active subject of debate 37, though one must accept
that treatment and policy recommendations will often depend on the question of
statistical significance38-40.
Multiple factors could potentially explain the observed differences between
comparative effectiveness research with registry data and randomized clinical trials,
though selection bias represents a key factor worth discussing. With observational
research the lack of randomization raises the important possibility of selection bias which
represents an imbalance in known or unknown confounding factors between treatment
groups. Factors such as body mass index, tobacco use or performance status – not
recorded in cancer registry data – could influence treatment decisions and independently
impact survival regardless of the treatment chosen. One could hypothesize that more
granular databases, such as cancer data linked to electronic health record data, could
help better control for these confounding factors, though the magnitude of how much
these factors influence results remains an open question which deserves further study.
Beyond selection bias, one must consider the potential influence of misclassified
cancer registry data. The Charlson index estimates a patient’s comorbidity, though
research suggests that this index may provide only a rough measure of underlying
comorbidity41, and additional research suggests that Charlson comorbidity may be
underreported within cancer registries42. Similarly, research demonstrates the potential
for underreporting of systemic therapy, hormonal therapy, and radiation therapy in
cancer registry data8. Overall, we lack a clear understanding of whether these
misclassified variables occur at random which would tend to bias results towards the null

(no survival difference), or occur not at random which could have an unpredictable
influence on survival analyses.
Beyond the aforementioned issues one must consider that even with perfect
cancer registry data the outcomes between observational cancer registry research and
randomized trials might fundamentally differ. Patients in clinical trials represent a
younger group of patients with better performance status and fewer comorbidities
compared to the general oncology population43. Differences in outcomes between
clinical trials and comparative effectiveness research with registry data could potentially
reflect a differential effect of treatment in healthier clinical trial patients 44. Similarly, one
must consider the possibility that the technical delivery of cancer therapy in the “real
world” may differ from delivering cancer therapy under the constraints of a clinical trial. In
this case, one could potentially consider differences in observational data as a potential
“implementation failure” as opposed to a true “treatment failure”. Overall, it is difficult to
identify one reason accounting for the differences in outcomes between observational
research and clinical trials. Ultimately these differences in outcomes likely stem from
multiple contributing factors.
This current study has limitations worth discussing. This study focused on
analyzing discordance in overall survival and could not evaluate cancer-specific survival
due to the lack of cause of death information within NCDB. While overall survival
represents a common primary endpoint in randomized clinical trials, one could
hypothesize that cancer-specific survival might represent an endpoint more likely to
produce concordant results between observational research studies and clinical trials.
This study focused on data within NCDB because of the detailed treatment information

provided with this dataset. We cannot comment on whether the observed findings in this
study hold with other observational datasets including SEER 7, administrative datasets, or
more granular institution-specific datasets. This study attempted to recreate clinical trials
with cancer registry data, though we could not account for all inclusion/exclusion criteria
associated with clinical trials including chemotherapy details (agents, dose and
schedule), hormone therapy agents, radiation techniques, and specific details of surgery.
This limitation holds true with this current analysis as well as any research involving
cancer registry data. Finally, this study used a structured approach to analyzing cancer
registry data, though one must acknowledge that incorporating different variables into
our multivariable models, or employing different propensity score analytic techniques
could potentially influence these outcomes.
Despite these limitations this study demonstrates substantial discordance in
survival outcomes between comparative effectiveness research with cancer registry data
and randomized clinical trial outcomes. These discrepant findings could represent
fundamental differences in patient selection or treatments rendered in clinical trials
compared to the real world. Alternatively, they could stem from issues surrounding
selection bias or misclassification of data within cancer registries. Regardless of the
underlying cause, understanding these differences will help provide context to providers
and researchers as they interpret comparative effectiveness research in oncology.

Figure 3. Predictors of discordance in hazard ratios with clinical trials and NCDB.
This forest plot demonstrates univariable logistic regression analyses to identify factors
that predict when an NCDB analyses will produce results discordant with randomized
clinical trials. Discordance NCDB analyses were defined as occasions when the NCDB
hazard ratio falls outside the 95% confidence interval of the hazard ratio in the clinical
trial. Odds ratios greater than 1 indicate NCDB analyses were more likely to be
discordant with clinical trials. Abbreviations: NCDB = National Cancer Database; ref =
reference.
