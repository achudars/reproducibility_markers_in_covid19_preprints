ABSTRACT

2
3

Objectives: At any point of time, a person’s baseline health is the number of healthy life

4

years they are expected to experience during the course of their lifetime. In this article we

5

propose an equity-relevant health metric, illness-specific individual Health Adjusted Life

6

Expectancy (iHALE), that facilitates comparison of baseline health for individuals at the

7

onset of different medical conditions, and allows for the assessment of which patient groups

8

are worse off. A method for calculating iHALE is presented, and we use this method to rank

9

four conditions in six countries according to several criteria of “worse off” as a proof of

10

concept.

11
12

Methods: iHALE measures baseline health at an individual level for specific conditions, and

13

consists of two components: past health (before disease onset) and future expected health

14

(after disease onset). Four conditions (acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute lymphoid

15

leukemia (ALL), schizophrenia, and epilepsy) are analysed in six countries (Ethiopia, Haiti,

16

China, Mexico, United States and Japan). Data for all countries and for all diseases in 2017

17

were obtained from the Global Burden of Disease Study database. In order to assess who are

18

the worse off, we focus on four measures: the proportion of affected individuals who are

19

expected to attain less than 20 healthy life years (T20), the 25th and 75th percentiles of healthy

20

life years for affected individuals (Q1 and Q3, respectively), and the average iHALE across

21

all affected individuals.

22
23

Results: Even in settings where average iHALE is similar for two conditions, other measures

24

may vary. One example is AML (average iHALE=58.7, T20=2.1, Q3-Q1=15.3) and ALL

25

(57.7, T20=4.7, Q3-Q1=21.8) in the US. Many illnesses, such as epilepsy, are associated with

higher baseline health in high-income settings (average iHALE in Japan=64.3) than in low-

2

income settings (average iHALE in Ethiopia=36.8).

Conclusion: iHALE allows for the estimation of the distribution of baseline health of all

5

individuals in a population. Hence, baseline health can be incorporated as an equity

6

consideration in setting priorities for health interventions.

INTRODUCTION

2

All health systems have budget constraints and limited resources. Methods for health

3

economic evaluations, like cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), are essential in health policy

4

and are extensively used to rank health services by their expected efficiency [1]. However,

5

few people endorse strict health maximisation [2], and fairness criteria may be included in

6

such rankings [3, 4]. For example, one may give higher priority to interventions that target

7

those with the most severe illnesses [5-7] , especially in relation to decisions about the pricing

8

and reimbursement of new medicines and devices [8, 9]. Policy makers in countries like

9

Norway [10] and the Netherlands [11] have already started using severity measurement

10

methods.

11
12

In this paper, the terms “illness”, “disease” and “condition” are used interchangeably, and

13

include all adverse medical conditions, such as injuries, syndromes, birth defects, and

14

infections. The term “severity of illness” involves both substantial value disagreements and a

15

wide range of interpretations [12, 13]. To sidestep misunderstandings, we use the concept of

16

“baseline health at disease onset” rather than severity of illness. Three perspectives on how to

17

measure baseline health dominate in the literature. One view considers current health [14],

18

one considers health over future years [15], and one considers health over the lifetime [16-

19

18]. In this paper we conform to the latter, and focus on how a particular illness is expected to

20

affect the total lifetime health achieved by an individual before they die [18]. This includes

21

both the past (before disease onset) and future (after disease onset). Clinical definitions of

22

severity of illness often include urgency, but our definition of baseline health does not.

23

Urgency pertains to the timing of treatment and how this influences the prognosis of a

24

condition. Conditions with a low baseline health at onset, like multiple sclerosis in young

25

patients, do not necessarily require urgent interventions.

The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study provides critical summary measures of

3

population health that are relevant when evaluating and comparing health systems [3]. These

4

measures include disability-adjusted life years (DALY) and healthy life expectancy (HALE).

5

DALYs are calculated for a set of diseases by summing the years of life lost (YLL) compared

6

to a reference life expectancy and years lived with disability (YLD) in one particular year due

7

to each disease [19]. For a particular condition and a particular year, YLL is the sum of all the

8

years lost for the individuals who died from the condition during that year. The reference is

9

the age-adjusted life expectancy (LE) from a life table derived from the mortality rates in the

10

locations with the lowest age-specific mortality in the GBD study [20]. YLD, on the other

11

hand, is the sum of the health loss due to the condition during the year across people living

12

with the condition [21]. DALYs aggregated from YLLs and YLDs are a measure of overall

13

population burden. A major limitation of these measures is that they do not capture how the

14

condition affects the distribution of baseline health at onset across individuals in the

15

population.

16
17

We propose a framework where this distribution is an integral part. A key component in this

18

framework is the new metric individual Health Adjusted Life Expectancy (iHALE). In this

19

paper, we present a method for calculating iHALE, and how to use iHALE to rank conditions

20

according to baseline health at onset. We consider four conditions and six countries to

21

illustrate how and why our framework is relevant for priority setting in health care and the

22

measurement of population health.

METHODS

2

Definition of iHALE

3

iHALE measures lifetime health at an individual level for individuals with specific

4

conditions, and consists of two components: past health and future expected health. We

5

obviously do not know the actual time of death for people dying in the future, but we do have

6

some knowledge about the expected distribution across individuals. Consider, for example,

7

two people aged 30 (Ann) and 50 (Bob) who each get a disease. The prognosis for Ann is that

8

she will certainly die within 20 years, but we do not know exactly when. The risk of dying is

9

99% before her 50th birthday, but there is also a 1% chance that she will die in her 51st year.

10

Bob, however, will certainly die before he is 51. For simplicity, we disregard health/disability

11

adjustment for time with illness, and focus only on their age at death. In a lifetime health

12

perspective, there is a 99% probability that Ann will die at a younger age than Bob will.

13

Hence, Ann’s baseline health is less than Bob’s in terms of total length of life (past life plus

14

expected future life), even though Bob’s expected future life is shorter. This is true even if

15

there is a 1% chance that Ann too will die in her 51st year. Health adjustment complicates

16

matters, as we will discuss below, but the principles are the same. Of course, iHALE needs to

17

go beyond hypothetical two-person cases to become a relevant health metric for priority

18

setting in countries with millions of individuals and multiple diseases. iHALE enables

19

comparison of both average baseline health and distribution of baseline health between

20

individuals with different diseases. Methods for calculating the iHALE distribution within

21

disease conditions are presented in the next sections.

22
23

Data

24

For illustrative purposes, we consider four conditions (acute myeloid leukemia (AML), acute

25

lymphoid leukemia (ALL), schizophrenia, and epilepsy) in six countries (Ethiopia, Haiti,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19003814; this version posted August 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

1

China, Mexico, United States and Japan). The diseases have distinct properties that highlight

2

certain characteristics of iHALE. The two leukemias are fatal, but the incidence of ALL peaks

3

at both young and older age groups, whereas AML incidence peaks at old age groups only.

4

Schizophrenia has large impact on disability over many years, and there are variations in both

5

mortality and morbidity of epilepsy across countries. We consider the leukemias in a US

6

setting, and then we compare schizophrenia and epilepsy across the six countries, representing

7

low-, middle- and high-income settings with different age distributions, levels of health

8

systems development, and access to healthcare among their populations. Data for all countries

9

and for all diseases in 2017 are obtained from the freely available GBD cause of death

10

database [20]. Table 1 describes variables available in the GBD database, and how they are

11

used to derive other important variables.

12
13

[Table 1 here]

14
15

The GBD database gives the parameters from Table 1 in 5-year age groups to age 95. The

16

under-5 age group is split into “less than one year old” (<1 group) and “1-4 years old”. To

17

obtain single-year age estimates, we undertake the following procedures. For pop, we divide

18

the population in the 4- and 5-year age groups evenly by single-year ages, and the terminal

19

age group (95 plus) is divided equally in five parts from 95 to 99. For example, if 500 000

20

individuals are in the 20-24 age group, we will assume that there are 100,000 20-year olds,

21

100,000 21-year olds, and so on. For PD, ID, dw, dwD, q(age), and MD(age), we assume that

22

the rates (or disability weights) are the same for each single-year age in the aggregate age

23

groups. For example, if dwD was 0.2 in the 20-24 age group, we assume that it was 0.2 for 20-

24

year olds, 0.2 for 21-year olds, and so on.

where “age” is the age of the individual and LYfuture is the number of life years each

8

actually dies, but its distribution can be estimated as follows. First, we define Y, the

9

maximum age in our lifetable, by setting the chance of surviving from age Y to Y+1 to zero.

10

Then we calculate the number of people who are expected to die at different ages in the Y

11

years to come. This can be done using an upper diagonal Y

calculations, we use Y=99. Note that it follows from the assumption of a static q(age) that

2

average LYfuture is the same as LE. From (1) we see that iLE is dominated by LYfuture for

3

young children, and by age for very old people.

4
5

Before we break the analysis into diseases, we start by analyzing total figures for one country,

6

as this is familiar for most readers and perhaps more intuitive. Figure 1 shows the distribution

7

of iLE for all age groups in the total population of the United States in 2017. In the left panel,

8

individuals alive in 2017 are ranked by their current age, and the right panel ranks them by

9

iLE. Now we can see that around 22 million people (7%) in the US have iLE < 60 years. As

10

expected, the proportion is much higher in Ethiopia (16%) and Haiti (20%). Note that by

11

simply focusing on LE, we would know nothing about such distributional characteristics.

will be small for all ages, and iLED will therefore to a large extent depend on age alone. If the

Figure 2 shows the estimated iLE distribution among the 10,600 people with incident cases of

2

acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and 1,950 people with incident cases of acute lymphoid

3

leukemia (ALL) in the United States in 2017. The LE was 67.9 for AML and 67.6 for ALL.

4

However, as the figure shows, the mean age of onset in the United States in 2017 was 62.5 for

Non-fatal morbidities should also be taken into account when assessing baseline health at

disease onset, so that one can compare across fatal and non-fatal diseases with different

14

impacts on health loss. This includes estimating health adjusted age (HAA) and future health

8

We assume that conditions are independent and that past dw are the same regardless of

9

current disease status.

10
11

To account for future non-fatal health loss caused by a disease, D, we use disease specific

12

excess disability, dwD, and mortality, qD, as calculated in Table 1. However, mortality risk is

13

returned from qD to q after a period of increased mortality (PIM), and morbidity returns from

14

dwD to dw after a period of increased disability (PID) (Table 1 expands on PIM and PID).

15
16

In Figure 3 we see from the AML examples how two different persons may fare under the

17

same PIM and PID. Person 1 survives long enough that both mortality and morbidity return to

18

those of the background population, and then dies at age 63 from a different cause, whereas

Person 2 dies during the PIM.

be adjusted during PID. This means that the disability increased for a period of PID years

We next set out to estimate the iHALE distribution in a population. This is done in several

Figure 4 shows that even though average iHALE is similar for AML (58.7) and ALL (57.7),

23

the distribution across individuals is different. For example, in the US we expect 4.7% of

24

individuals with ALL to have iHALE < 20 (T20), compared with only 2.1% for individuals

25

with AML. Hence, considering risk of a low baseline health, individuals with ALL would be

than in people with AML (67.9), so with respect to chance of a high baseline health

individuals with AML would be the worse off. Again, this highlights the need for

RESULTS

2

Table 2 shows average iHALE, T20, Q1 and Q3 for ALL, AML, schizophrenia and epilepsy

3

in six countries (see Appendix Table A4 for 200 NCDI conditions). Rank orders of the four

4

conditions varied both between countries and according to measure of who is worse off.

5
6

[Table 2 here]

7
8

The iHALE distribution for schizophrenia was similar across the six settings, although Japan

9

stands out in a positive manner. The difference in average iHALE for schizophrenia between

10

the US and Japan was larger than the difference between the US and Ethiopia (Haiti 40.7,

11

Ethiopia 41.1, China 45.7, Mexico 44.4, US 43.5, Japan 48.6). The same applied to the

12

quartiles. T20, the proportion of people with iHALE <20, was low across countries for

13

schizophrenia, which is reasonable, as schizophrenia rarely manifests in childhood.

14

Variability in average iHALE for epilepsy between countries was high (Ethiopia 36.8, Haiti

15

39.5, Mexico 53.5, China 56.6, US 58.8, Japan 64.3). In addition, there is much more unequal

16

iHALE distribution for epilepsy in countries with low average iHALE (difference between

17

quartiles (Q3-Q1) was 19.9 in Ethiopia, 17.9 in Haiti, 15.2 in China, 14.9 in Mexico, 13.3 in

18

Japan, and 13.2 in the US). Further, only 0.6% of the Japanese had iHALE under 20, but the

19

number was 14.0% among Ethiopians and 8.4% among Haitians.

DISCUSSION

2

According to fairness concerns, limited health care resources should be allocated to

3

interventions that benefit the worse off in society [5-7, 18]. In this paper, we present a

4

quantitative method for identifying the worse off by estimating the distribution of lifetime

5

health across individuals in the same disease category. We show how two conditions, ALL

6

and AML, with similar LEs and average iHALEs have substantially different distributions of

7

iHALE. In addition, we show how iHALE varies across countries, and demonstrate how the

8

iHALE distribution captures different aspects of the fact that diseases are typically more

9

severe in low-income than in high-income countries. Our new framework important for

10

priority setting because it can be used to assign extra value to health gains from interventions

11

targeting the worse off. The relevance of iHALE is particularly good for preventive

12

interventions for a disease where you are likely to capture benefits across a range of ages (for

13

example treating strep throat in school children to prevent rheumatic heart disease).

14
15

Sullivan, in 1971, suggested how morbidity adjustment could be done for LE to get HALE by

16

modifying the standard life table model to estimate the expected duration of a condition by

17

exposing a birth cohort of a disease specific mortality and disability rate over a lifetime [22].

18

Sullivan’s method estimates average expected years of healthy life rather than the distribution

19

of iHALE between individuals as done in this paper.

20
21

In this article we present iHALE as an achievement measure, but it may be more intuitive to

22

present baseline health at disease onset as a shortfall from what individuals could potentially

23

achieve. iHALE could be converted to an individual gap-measure (e.g. iDALY) by using the

24

YLL method applied in GBD. Shortfall in life years could be calculated for each individual at

25

disease onset by using the lowest mortality by age in the world as a reference. Shortfall in

1

disabilities could use the lowest YLD rates across countries as a reference for disability

2

shortfall. However, disease shortfall measures are beyond the scope of this paper.

3
4

PIM and PID, as presented in this paper, have some limitations. They could be different for

5

the same condition across settings, as would be the case for conditions, like HIV, that can be

6

treated or controlled more effectively in some countries than in others. Part of these

7

differences should be captured in the excess mortality differences between countries in our

8

current analysis, but the durations of the periods are also likely to vary. Additionally, PIM and

9

PID do not capture the nature of conditions where mortality and morbidity have complicated

10

temporal patterns. For example, the peak increase in mortality risk for HIV patients is about a

11

decade after onset. At a conceptual level, these obstacles are easy to handle. One simply must

12

estimate PIM and PID for all conditions under consideration in all relevant settings. However,

13

the empirical task of getting precise PIM and PID estimates is not trivial.

14
15

Understanding the underlying reasons for differences in the distribution of iHALE can have

16

policy implications. Observed differences in the distribution of iHALE between countries can

17

originate from a number of reasons. It is important to note that as a measure of lifetime health

18

among people with a specific condition, iHALE is influenced by mortality risk and morbidity

19

from other causes, as well as by the age at which the disease occurs. Thus, variation in iHALE

20

could be caused from differences in demography and epidemiology at the country level, or

21

from variations in access to health care that underlie differences in disease-specific morbidity

22

or mortality rates. The relative contribution of each of these differences to the overall

23

difference in iHALE between countries depends on which countries are being compared. How

24

to quantify the role of each factor is discussed further in Appendix (Figure A2).

1

To measure the true disease-specific baseline health distribution, the past health would be

2

calculated using observed past disability for individuals. The data available for our

3

calculations were limited in several ways. There was no individual-level morbidity and

4

mortality information, so we used population averages. This meant that we were unable to

5

account for correlation between illnesses. For example, people who die of a car accident at

6

age 45 may be different on average from those who die of a myocardial infarction at age 45

7

regarding lifestyle (smoking, exercise, diet) and biology (metabolism, genetics), which could

8

affect the risk of other morbidities. As a result, our estimates of iHALE may be high

9

(overestimate baseline health) for illnesses that are often experienced with comorbidities

10

because they do not capture the higher burden from the associated illnesses. Conversely, our

11

estimates of iHALE may be low (underestimate baseline health) for illnesses that have few

12

comorbidities. These limitations are especially evident in mental health conditions. The GBD

13

estimates do not attribute any mortality to mental health disorders; however, we know that

14

patients with mental health disorders have higher mortality risk compared to the general

15

population [23-25]. Our schizophrenia iHALE results are additionally limited by distributions

16

of disability weights that do not vary along with treatment availability across countries [26].

17

The limited time series available from the GBD meant that we did not have complete

18

historical average disability rates. For consistency, we used age-specific rates of disability for

19

the calculations of past health; however, health achievement in a real population would use

20

historical disability information if available.

CONCLUSION

2

Increasing availability of demographic and epidemiologic data creates opportunities for

3

quantifying the baseline health at disease onset to guide priority setting in health care. Policy

4

makers, supported by the ethical literature, are concerned about giving higher priority to the

5

worse off. However, the impact of such fairness concerns to health policy does not match the

6

impact cost-effectiveness analysis has had on policy the last decades. Data availability and

7

lack of rigorous methods for quantifying the baseline health at disease onset are likely

8

contributing factors to the negligence of the worse off in de facto health care priority setting.

9

Here we have presented a method for calculating iHALE and illustrate with examples how

10

and why a metric that is sensitive to distribution is relevant for priority setting in health care

11

and the measurement of population health. We lay the foundations for undertaking detailed

12

calculations of disease-specific iHALE in multiple countries.

For a disease D, the dashed black line is background mortality, and the blue line is

16

background mortality added to the excess risk of death caused by D. The orange area is

The top solid black line gives a period after the onset of D when the person had a period of

20

increased mortality (PIM). The bottom line gives a similar period of increased disability

A2 Decomposition
To illustrate how differences in demography, epidemiology, and disease specific mortality
and morbidity led to differences in average iHALE between Japan and Ethiopia as exemplars,
we took an approach that parallels methods described by Das Gupta [2], creating estimates
using the 64 possible scenarios of the two values for the 6 input factors. For each factor, there
are then 32 pairs of scenarios in which all five other factors remain constant but the factor in
question takes on either Japan or Ethiopia’s value. To calculate the effect of each factor on the
overall iHALE difference between Ethiopia and Japan, we took the average of the difference
in iHALE between these 32 sets of paired scenarios. Essentially, this is the average effect of
varying that one factor with every possible combination of other factors. Figure A2 shows the
results of this decomposition. As expected, the younger age structure in Ethiopia and the
higher overall mortality contributes substantially to differences in iHALE. However, we also
see that disease-specific mortality differences play a large role for epilepsy, leading to a much
lower iHALE in Ethiopia. The disease-specific disability plays a very small role for
schizophrenia, as discussed in the main text, because of a lack of variation in the distribution
of severity across countries in the input data from the GBD data (see A3). Surprisingly, the
age distribution of incidence contributes to higher iHALE in Ethiopia, a function of the age
distribution of incidence rates from GBD, which tend to be higher at older ages and lower at
younger ages in Ethiopia.

A3 Age-standardized average disability weight
Mental disorders like major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia
show almost no difference in age-standardized average disability weight between high income
and low income countries in GBD, despite higher treatment rates in high income settings. We
might expect the distribution of severity to be more severe in low income settings where
treatment is less available. Differences in iHALE between high and low income settings,
particularly for nonfatal conditions like mental health disorders, are limited by these estimated
severities in GBD. Note the much larger difference in average disability weight for epilepsy.
