Abstract
Introduction
Yaws is a neglected tropical disease and results in lesions of skin, soft tissues and bones. PCR
plays an important part in surveillance.
Methods
Children suspected to have yaws were enrolled. From the largest lesion paired swabs were
collected; one into transport medium and one as a dry swab. In children with multiple lesions
we collected additional swabs from up to four subsequent lesions. Swabs in transport medium
were maintained in a cold-chain whilst dry swabs were stored at ambient temperature. Swabs
were tested by PCR for Treponema pallidum and Haemophilus ducreyi.
Results
Of 55 individuals, 10 (18%) had at least 1 positive PCR for T. pallidum and 12 (22%) had at least
1 positive result for H. ducreyi. Concordance was 100% between swabs in transport medium
and dry swabs. One patient had PCR-confirmed yaws on the swab of a third lesion when both
the first and second lesions were PCR-negative.
Discussion
Storing swabs in transport medium and transporting in a cold chain did not improve yield,
however detection of T. pallidum is increased by swabbing additional lesions. As the target for

Introduction
Yaws, caused by the Treponema pallidum subsp. pertenue, is a neglected tropical disease (NTD)
and results in lesions of the skin, soft tissues and bones[1,2]. The disease predominantly affects
children and is known to be endemic in 15 countries[3]. Transmission of yaws occurs from
person to person through direct skin contact with infectious exudates of early skin lesions of
infected individuals[4]. Early, active yaws is characterised by papillomatous and ulcerative
lesions which are highly infectious. Untreated lesions of early yaws may spontaneously heal but
periods of relapse to infectious yaws may continue for a number of years. In a proportion of
untreated individuals the disease progresses to highly destructive lesions of the skin and bones
which result in chronic disfigurement and disability[2,5].
Interest in yaws has increased in recent years, following studies showing azithromycin to be
highly effective in the treatment of yaws and that community mass treatment by azithromycin
reduces the prevalence of both active and latent disease[6–10], culminating in renewed efforts
by the World Health Organization (WHO) to achieve global yaws eradication[11]. Despite global
eradication efforts led by WHO and UNICEF between 1952 and 1965 and further national
efforts between 1981 and 1983, Ghana remains endemic for yaws, and reports the most cases
of any country in Africa[3,4]. Yaws remains an important public health problem in the country
and is reported in all the 10 regions of Ghana and nearly all the districts in the country. In 2008
Ghana launched the National Yaws Eradication Program (NYEP). The programme has succeeded
in increasing the number of contacts treated per yaws case from 3.5 in 2008 to 10.8 in
2013[12]and in conducting pilot implementations of the WHO ‘Morges’ strategy for yaws

eradication[10,11]. Currently in Ghana, as in other endemic countries, the diagnosis of yaws is
most often based on clinical grounds alone without the aid of serological or molecular
investigations. Studies in many settings have indicated that clinical diagnosis alone may be
unreliable[13–15] and WHO has strongly advocated the introduction of diagnostic tests to
improve the quality of epidemiological data on yaws in endemic countries[16].
Serological methods remain the mainstay for laboratory confirmation of yaws and include both
treponemal and non-treponemal tests. Treponemal tests such as the Treponema
pallidum particle agglutination (TPPA) assay are highly specific, but remain positive for life

following infection. Diagnosis of current disease therefore relies on both a positive treponemal
test but also a reactive non-treponemal tests such as the rapid plasma regain (RPR) or the
Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VRDL) test. Titres of non-treponemal tests rise during
infection and fall following successful treatment [2]. Rapid diagnostic tests that combine
treponemal and non-treponemal components, such as the dual path platform (DPP) ‘syphilis
screen and confirm’ assay, have now been validated for the diagnosis of yaws and have largely
replaced traditional laboratory assays within the programmatic setting [17–20].
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods to detect treponemal DNA from genital ulcers of
venereal syphilis have been available for more than two decades [21,22]. More PCR assays
have been developed that are able to differentiate between the DNA of different subspecies of
T.pallidum complex[14,23]. Due to primer binding-site mutations occurring in some strains of

yaws the current recommendation is to use a pan-treponemal PCR target such as polA or tp47

for the diagnosis of yaws[24]. When PCR is used to assess individuals with clinical and
serological evidence of yaws a large proportion of lesions are found to contain no treponemal
DNA[23,25]. In several studies Haemophilus ducreyi has been demonstrated to be a common
cause of skin lesions which may be confused with those of yaws in endemic countries in the
South Pacific islands and Africa [15,25,26]. For this reason there is recognition that PCR will play
an increasingly important part in yaws surveillance efforts worldwide [16].
Currently there is limited data on the optimal approach to collecting samples for molecular
confirmation of yaws. In a number of studies samples have been collected from a single lesion
per individual, placed in transport medium and shipped within a strict cold chain[23,25,27]. A
number of studies assessing the use of PCR for the diagnosis of yaws have suggested that
transport medium is unnecessary and that dry swabs perform equally well[28]. A move to dry
swabs and shipping at ambient temperatures would reduce programmatic costs and potentially
increase feasibility of incorporating molecular testing into the programmatic context. In this
study we aimed to evaluate whether collection of additional swabs, from more than a single
lesion, and the presence or absence of transport medium affected the performance of PCR for
the diagnosis of yaws.

Methods
Case Finding and Screening:

The study was conducted in the West Akim and Upper West Akim districts in the Eastern Region
of Ghana. These districts were selected as they are known to be highly endemic for yaws. We
conducted active case finding searches in July 2018 in collaboration with the National Yaws
Eradication Project (NYEP). Field workers visited schools to identify children with lesions
consistent with yaws. Children with sores, ulcers or skin lesions were asked to come forward for
more detailed examination as per routine NYEP protocol during case searching. Children with
yaws-like ulcers were first screened with the SD Bioline syphilis test and those who tested
positive were then tested with the DPP Syphilis Screen and Confirm test. Individuals with a dual
positive (treponemal and non-treponemal) DPP assay were enrolled into the study.

Swab Collection:

We identified a maximum of 5 yaws-like lesions per individual prior to treatment. Swabs were
taken in line with the WHO recommendations for swabbing yaws lesions. In brief, a single
Dacron swab was used to obtain tissue from each lesion. This was performed by pressing the
head of the swab into the centre of the lesion and rotating the swab over the area. If a lesion or
papilloma was dry, the area was moistened using sterile saline on some gauze and the
outermost epithelial lining was gently removed using a blunt object before swabbing. We
identified the largest, most exudative lesions first. From this lesion paired swabs were
collected; the first into transport medium and the second as a dry swab. From a maximum of
four subsequent lesions we collected additional dry swabs at baseline. All individuals were then

offered a single-dose of azithromycin in line with national guidelines. Follow-up dry swabs were
collected in the same manner from the first three lesions at 8, 24, 36 and 48 hours after
treatment with azithromycin.

Swab Storage

Swabs in transport medium were placed immediately into a cool box and were frozen at -20°C
at the laboratories of Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research (NMIMR). Swabs in
transport medium were then shipped on dry-ice to the UK where they were again frozen at 20°C until testing. Dry swabs not in transport medium were stored at ambient temperature in
the field for the duration of the study and shipped at ambient temperature to the UK for
testing.

Swab Testing

DNA was extracted from lesion swabs using the QIAamp DNA Mini Kit according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Multiplex PCR targeting the tp47 of T. pallidum and the hhdA gene

of H. ducreyi was performed on a Rotorgene 3000 as previously described[22]. If baseline swabs
were PCR positive for either target, the follow-up swabs from the same lesion were extracted
and tested using the same PCR targets. Positive and no-template controls were included in
every PCR run.

Analysis:

We compared the proportion of samples positive by PCR for either T. pallidum or H. ducreyi for
the paired lesion samples collected from the ‘target’ lesion. We considered the samples
collected in transport medium and maintained in cold chain as the gold standard and the dry
swabs stored at ambient temperature to be the comparator. We calculated the proportion of
individuals diagnosed with either T. pallidum or H. ducreyi based only on a swab of the target
lesion to the proportion diagnosed based on swabbing of multiple lesions. For individuals
whose lesion was PCR positive at baseline we assessed the number of lesions in which
pathogen DNA remained detectable after treatment with azithromycin.

Ethics Approval:

Ethics approval for the study was obtained from the Ghana Health Services Ethics Review
Committee and London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Parents or guardians
provided written informed consent for children to participate in the study and where
appropriate assent was also obtained from children.

Results
Approximately 3,000 children were screened during active case searches to identify 55
individuals with clinical evidence of yaws and a dual positive DPP assay. The median age of
individuals enrolled in the study was 10 years (IQR 9-12) and a majority of patients were male
(n = 33, 60%). For dry swabs the median duration of storage at ambient temperature was 22
days (IQR 21-32).
Overall, 10 (18%) patients had at least 1 positive PCR result for T. pallidum and 12 (22%)
patients had at least 1 positive PCR result for H. ducreyi, representing 22% of all participants. Of
the 55 children included in this study, 53 had a swab from their target lesion collected both into
transport medium and a dry swab at baseline. There was 100% concordance between the
results of PCR conducted on swabs collected in transport medium and maintained in a cold
chain and dry swabs stored at ambient temperature.
Overall 111 baseline swabs were collected from the 55 patients enrolled in the study. The
median number of swabs per patient was 2 (IQR 1-2.5). Overall a total of 14 swabs (12.6%)
were positive for T. pallidum of which 9 swabs were from target lesions. Four swabs were
positive from additional lesions of patients whose target lesion was also PCR-positive for T.
pallidum. One patient had PCR confirmed yaws diagnosed based on the swab of a third lesion

when both the target and secondary swabbed lesion were PCR-negative. Overall a total of 17
swabs (15.3%) were positive for H. ducreyi of which 9 were from target lesions. Five swabs were
positive from additional lesions of patients whose target lesion was also PCR-positive for H.

ducreyi whilst three samples were positive from individuals whose target lesion was PCR-

negative for H. ducreyi. Of 14 swabs that were positive at baseline for T. pallidum, follow-up
swabs were available for 11 lesions. Of these 11 lesions every available follow-up swab
remained PCR-positive, including the seven patients who had swabs collected 48 hours after
treatment.

Discussion
PCR has become an important tool in diagnosis and surveillance for yaws as part of global
eradication efforts. In this study we demonstrate that storing swabs in transport medium and
transporting them within a cold chain does not improve the diagnostic yield compared to dry
swabs stored at ambient temperature. Our findings may have significant cost and logistical
implications for programmes and should increase the feasibility of incorporating molecular
diagnostics into routine care and surveillance activities. In addition, despite our relatively small
sample size, we also demonstrated that the detection of T. pallidum could be increased by
swabbing additional lesions beyond the ‘target’ lesion. Swabbing only a single lesion has been
practice in all studies to date[15,23,25,27] but our data suggests such an approach will result in
misclassification of cases. As the target for yaws is global eradication, detection of every case is
vital and our study demonstrates that the approach to sample collection will need to be
revisited to ensure cases of active yaws are not missed.
Access to PCR to confirm the diagnosis of yaws remains extremely limited in all endemic
countries outside of research studies. Diagnostic confusion with H. ducreyi and the need to
monitor for the emergence of azithromycin resistance in T. pallidum highlight that molecular
tools will be required to support global yaws eradication efforts[16,29]. This is the first study to
assess the impact of the use of transport medium and a cold-chain on the diagnostic yield of
lesion swabs for PCR. The cycle threshold (CT) value of the PCR assay was also similar for both
dry swabs and swabs collected in transport medium (data not shown) suggesting that DNA was
also not adversely affected by the absence of transport medium or a cold-chain. Taken

together with existing studies on syphilis our data suggests that there is no benefit in using
transport medium or a cold chain for routine diagnostic purposes. Simplifying sample
collection, storage and transport requirements should reduce cost and improve the feasibility
of implementing PCR as part of programmatic activities.
Many patients with yaws have multiple lesions on examination however to date studies have
focused on collecting a sample from only the largest ‘target’ lesion. Such a strategy presumes
that all skin lesions in an individual are caused by the same pathogen. In this study we clearly
demonstrate that this may result in missing PCR positive cases of yaws. As the aim of the WHO
strategy is global eradication detection of every case is vital and our data strongly argues that
consideration be given to swabbing multiple skin lesions where these are present to ensure all
cases of active yaws are detected. We used separate swabs for each lesion and tested these
separately. Pooling of samples for testing or use of a single swab for multiple lesions may
facilitate similar increases in diagnostic yield whilst avoiding the additional cost of performing
separate PCR on multiple lesions. We also demonstrated that lesions remain positive by PCR up
to 48 hours after treatment. Whilst a positive PCR after treatment might simply represent
detection of DNA and not viable organisms, our findings support the WHO recommendation to
provide wound dressings as well as treatment to reduce any potential risk of ongoing
transmission post-treatment.
The major limitation of our study is the relatively small sample size. It is possible that with a
larger number of T. pallidum PCR positive lesions that we might have been able to demonstrate
a difference in the performance of PCR between samples collected into transport medium

compared to dry swabs. However, studies in syphilis have also demonstrated no difference
between samples collected into transport medium or dry swabs [28,30,31]. Samples were
stored at ambient temperature for a median of more than twenty days which is likely to be
longer that the average duration of sample transport under programmatic conditions. We
believe therefore, that our results are robust and that in routine settings there is no
requirement for transport medium or a cold chain when collecting diagnostic samples.
Secondly, swabbing of additional lesions detected only a single extra case of PCR confirmed
active yaws. However, this additional case represented 10% of all cases of active yaws
diagnosed in the study. For the global eradication campaign, it will be vital to detect every case,
and our data strongly supports the need to consider swabbing multiple lesions when they are
present.
Conclusion
Molecular tests will play a central role in surveillance and monitoring during yaws eradication
efforts but there have been few studies evaluating how best to operationalise this tool. By
simplifying sample collection, storage and transport and highlighting the importance of
sampling multiple lesions, the data from our study should enable programmes to optimise their
use of this critical diagnostic tool and support successful global eradication efforts.
