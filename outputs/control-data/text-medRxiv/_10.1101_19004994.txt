Abstract

33

Owing to the often prohibitively high costs of medical examinations, or an absence of infrastructure

34

for linkage of study members to morbidity registries, much aetiological research in the field of

35

cardiovascular research relies on death records. Because they are regarded as being more distal to

36

risk factor assessment than morbidity endpoints, mortality data are generally maligned in this

37

context for seemingly providing less clear insights into aetiology. The relative utility of mortality

38

versus morbidity registries is, however, untested. In a pooling of data from three large cohort

39

studies whose participants had been linked to both death and morbidity registries for coronary heart

40

disease, we related a range of established and emerging risk factors to these two methods of

41

ascertainment. A mean duration of study member surveillance of 10.1 years (mortality) and 9.9

42

years (morbidity) for a maximum of 20,956 study members (11,868 women) in the analytical

43

sample yielded 289 deaths from coronary heart disease and 770 hospitalisations for this condition.

44

The direction of the age- and sex-adjusted association was the same for 21 of the 24 risk factor–

45

morbidity/mortality combinations. The only marked discordance in effect estimates, such that

46

different conclusions about the association could be drawn, was for social support, total cholesterol,

47

and fruit/vegetable consumption whereby null effects were evident for selected outcomes. In

48

conclusion, variation in disease definition typically did not have an impact on the direction of the

49

association of an array of risk factors for coronary heart disease.

Introduction

52

Despite declining rates, coronary heart disease remains a burdensome cause of death and disability

53

worldwide.1 In on-going efforts to identify new environmental and genetic risk factors for coronary

54

heart disease, events based on disease incidence are regarded as being preferable to events based on

55

deaths. Incidence data, which may be derived from record linkage or medical examination in

56

population-based cohort studies, are privileged because of their proximity to risk factor assessment,

57

seemingly providing clearer insights into aetiology. By contrast, mortality data comprise not only

58

the morbid event itself but, in the high probability of survival following a heart attack, prognosis.

59

Owing to the often prohibitively high costs of medical examinations, or an absence of infrastructure

60

for linkage of study members to morbidity registries, most investigators have to rely on death

61

records.2 3 In a pooling of data from three large cohort studies whose participants had been linked

62

to death and hospital registries for morbidity, for the first time, we assessed the relative utility of

63

each ascertainment method by relating them to a range of established and emerging risk factors.4

64
65

Methods

66

We pooled data from the Scottish Health Surveys which comprise three identical prospective cohort

67

studies, baseline data collection for which took place in 1995, 1998 and 2003. Described in detail

68

elsewhere,5 risk factor data were collected using standard, identical protocols. Individuals without a

69

history of heart disease hospitalisation were flagged for mortality using the procedures of the UK

70

NHS Central Registry and hospitalisations using Scottish Morbidity Records database.3 Ethical

71

approval for data collection was granted by the London Research Ethics Council, or local research

72

ethics councils. Participants gave informed consent.

77

for a maximum of 20,956 study members (11,868 women) in the analytical sample yielded 289

78

deaths from coronary heart disease and 770 hospitalisations for this condition. Findings for risk

79

factors known to be causally linked to coronary heart disease are presented in figure 1; results for

80

emerging risk factors and those thought to be non-causally associated are depicted in figure 2.

81
82

The direction of the age- and sex-adjusted association was the same for 22 of the 24 risk factor–

83

morbidity/mortality combinations. As evidenced by the test for heterogeneity by outcome

84

ascertainment, there was, however, occasionally some differences in the magnitude of association,

85

such that somewhat stronger effects were apparent in mortality analyses for age, physical inactivity,

86

(figure 1), educational attainment, mental illness, lung function, and salivary cotinine (a biomarker

87

for cigarette smoke exposure) (figure 2). The only marked discordance in effect estimates, such

88

that different conclusions about the association could be drawn, was for social support (indexed by

89

relationship status), total cholesterol, and fruit and vegetable consumption whereby null effects

90

were evident for selected outcomes. Aggregating risk factors into the Framingham algorithm

91

revealed very similar predictive capacity for coronary heart disease whether based on morbidity or

92

mortality records.

93
94

Discussion

95

The main finding of the present analyses was that variation in disease definition – morbidity or

96

mortality – did not have an impact on the direction of the association of an array of known risk

97

factors for coronary heart disease. Comparable results reported for another cardiovascular outcome,

98

stroke, support the validity of our findings.6

99
100

Our findings suggest that for the most common presentation of cardiovascular disease there is no

101

obvious advantage to utilising morbidity records. This has implications for those investigators

102

operating outside countries with well-established data linkage procedures who only have access to

103

death registers. Our findings may also suggest that morbidity data collected via study member

104

attendance at designated clinical research centres have no additional utility, though no such direct

105

comparison was made herein. Lastly, whether morbidity records for other cardiovascular disease

106

sub-types such as peripheral vascular disease, heart failure, abdominal aortic aneurysm, amongst

107

others, also offer no analytical advantage to death records is unknown.
