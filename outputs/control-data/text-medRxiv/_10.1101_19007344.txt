ABSTRACT
Background
Unexplained-sudden cardiac death (SCD) describes SCD with no cause identified after a
comprehensive autopsy and toxicologic examination. Genetic testing helps to diagnose inherited
cardiac diseases in unexplained-SCD, however, the relationship between pathogenic or likely
pathogenic (P/LP) variants of inherited cardiomyopathies and primary electrical disorders (PED)
and risk of unexplained-SCD in adults living the United States has never been systematically
examined.
Methods
We performed sequencing of 29 cardiomyopathy and 39 arrhythmia genes in 413 AfricanAmericans and Caucasians (>18 years-old) who died of unexplained-SCD (median age; 41 yearsold, 37% females, 50% African-Americans) and whose hearts were found to have no gross
pathological finding upon referral to our institution for pathologic consultation from the State of
Maryland Medical Examiner. We examined P/LP variants in these genes to study the association
between presence of these variants and unexplained-SCD.
Results
143/413 (34.6%) subjects had variants considered P/LP for cardiomyopathy and/or PED
(i.e. Brugada Syndrome (BrS), long QT syndrome (LQTS), and arrhythmogenic right ventricular
dysplasia (ARVD)).

In total, 102 (24.7%) subjects harbored 86 P/LP variants for

cardiomyopathies and 60 (14.5%) subjects carried 76 P/LP variants for PED. The following
pathogenic variants were identified: 68 P/LP variants for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in
79/413 (19.1%) subjects, 18 P/LP variants for dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in 22/413 subjects

(5.3%), and 76 P/LP variants in 60/413 (14.5%) for PED. There were greater than 121.0- and
138.5- fold median enrichments (431.4- and 200.0- fold cumulative enrichments) in these
cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia variants in victims of unexplained SCD versus the general
population, respectively. Among these P/LP positive carriers, combinations of conditions were
found, including 14/413 (2.4%) having both HCM and PED variants, and 5/413 (1.2%) with DCM
and PED variants. African Americans (AA) and Caucasians were equally likely to harbor P/LP
variants (32.7% versus 36.6%, p=0.5), but AA had a higher frequent variants of unknown
significance.
Conclusions
This study represents the largest examination reported on the association between
cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia P/LP genetic variants and unexplained-SCD in adults with no
gross abnormality on rigorous pathological examination. Nearly one-third of those with
unexplained-SCD were carriers of P/LP variants. Our findings with respect to both the association
of unexplained SCD with cardiomyopathy genes and race-specific genetic variants suggest new
avenues of study for this poorly understood entity.

INTRODUCTION
The incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the United States (US) ranges from
180,000 to 450,000 cases annually 1, 2. Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the most common
substrate underlying SCD in the western world, being responsible for 50-75% of SCDs. While
autopsy studies may lead to a diagnosis of structural heart disease in many of the remaining cases
(e.g. SCD subjects without CHD), in 30-40% (so-called unexplained-SCD) the cause still remains
uncertain despite toxicologic and histopathologic analysis 2, 3.
Molecular autopsy improves diagnostic accuracy in subjects with normal cardiac autopsy.
In the young, primary electrical disorders (PED) are a well-recognized cause of SCD in the
absence of structural heart disease. Although several cardiomyopathy gene variants have also been
reported to increase risk for SCD; whether these variants can accurately predict future SCD risk,
especially in those without overt structural heart disease, remains controversial 4, 5. Recently
European recommendations were published integrating genetic testing into multidisciplinary
management of SCD. These guidelines emphasized the importance of genetic testing and
appropriate information provision of affected individuals, as well as their relatives 6.
Most studies of unexplained SCD conducted to date have concentrated on small numbers of
young subjects (i.e. <35 years of age) from Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain,
United Kingdom, France, and South Korea 7-13, all relatively homogenous populations without the
racial diversity seen in the US. Even though the incidence of sudden death increases dramatically
with age and is higher in men than women, our understanding of the causes of unexplained SCD in
adults, especially those of African Americans descent, is limited 14.

Here we conducted the largest and most systematic genetic examination of adult African
American and Caucasian individuals in the US who died and were referred for autopsy with
suspected SCD but had normal cardiac pathologic findings. Our goal was to understand the
association between pathogenic variants for PED and cardiomyopathies and risk of unexplainedSCD in adult individuals living in the US.

METHODS

Study Design and Oversight

Between 1995 to 2015, CVPath Institute was referred a total of 5,262 hearts from cases of
unexpected sudden death from the Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of the State of Maryland
(OCME-MD). (Unexpected sudden death cases in the state of Maryland are routinely referred to
our Institute for consultation at the discretion of the medical examiner). At OCME-MD, a
complete and comprehensive autopsy and toxicologic analysis is performed in all referred
decedents up to 50 years old and in cases over 50 years old without evidence of possible
drug/alcohol abuse. For every case, the heart was systematically evaluated with detailed
histopathological analysis performed by an experienced cardiac pathologist at CVPath. To examine
race-based differences, only African American or Caucasian individuals over 18 years old were
analyzed in the current study (n=4,270). The racial origin of subjects was identified from the
OCME-MD report through inquiry of family members. Subjects with clear non-cardiac cause of
death as well as cases with lack of detailed information were excluded from the study (n=950).
Subjects with SCD due to sudden coronary death (n=1,875; i.e. acute coronary syndrome, >75%

stenosis in any major epicardial coronary artery, or previous bypass or stent placement) and other
known causes of sudden cardiac death (n=762; i.e. cardiomyopathy (e.g. hypertrophic, dilated or
arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathies, etc.), significant valvular disease, congenital
heart disease, myo/pericarditis, or infective endocarditis) were excluded from the study. See
Figure 1 for study flowchart.

Assessment of Hearts to rule out any known cause of death.

More details of the histopathologic analysis are given in the Methods section in the
Supplemental Materials. All specimens had been fixed in 10% buffered formalin. The epicardial
coronary arteries were sectioned at 3 to 4 intervals to rule out any significant atherosclerosis. The
base of the heart at the level of the tip of the mitral valve was used to measure the left ventricle
(LV) free wall, ventricular septal thickness, and right ventricular wall thickness followed by left
ventricular cavity diameter excluding the pectinate and papillary muscles. In total 6 sections of
myocardium (anterior, posterior, and lateral LV, ventricular septum, anterior and posterior wall of
the right ventricle) were routinely taken transversely, embedded in paraffin, and stained with
hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) stain for histologic evaluation. Histologic examination was
performed to rule out any infiltrative process or any myofiber disarray of the myocardium,
intramyocardial small vessel disease of interstitial or focal fibrosis. The presence of any of these
cardiomyopathic processes resulted in exclusion from the normal heart category. Wall thickness
measurements from subjects with normal hearts were consistent with previous autopsy studies of
“normal hearts” 15. (Autopsy wall thicknesses overall are thicker than that reported by

echocardiographic measurement in living patients which is consistent with prior studies and values
from previous autopsy studies of normal hearts 16.)

Definition of Normal Hearts

“Normal” heart was defined as an individual dying of natural causes with no evidence of
heart disease following a complete gross and histopathological evaluation. Assessment of the
myocardial sections ruled out the presence of any cardiomyopathic process. In addition,
microscopic examination also helped to rule out severe myocyte hypertrophy (defined as cardiac
myocyte thickness greater than 25 µm 17), and severe fibrosis in the myocardium (area of fibrosis
>3% of the section) (Figure 1). Suspected unexplained-SCD was defined as symptoms
commencing within 1 hour of death (with or without witnessed arrest) or death occurring within 24
hours after the victim was last seen alive in their normal state of health, and in whom a clear cause
of death (CoD) could not be established after a complete and comprehensive autopsy examination
(including cardiac examination). All cases of SCD with normal autopsy were adjudicated to be
unexplained by three cardiologists (ST, CCH, AVF) and a cardiac pathologist (RV). The protocol
for the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the CVPath Institute.

DNA Collection, Next-generation Sequencing and Data Analysis
Genomic DNAs were extracted from either fresh frozen tissue and FFPE tissue blocks
using DNeasy Tissue kit and QIAamp DNA FFPE Tissue Kit (Qiagen), respectively. TruSeq
Custom Amplicon Low Input was used to construct the libraries using custom design

cardiomyopathy gene panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The libraries were multiplexed and
sequenced on HiSeq 550 Rapid Run mode (Illumina). Fastq sequencing data were analyzed using
TruSeq Amplicon workflow Version 3.0.0 on BaseSpace platform (Illumina), including Isas
(analysis software) Version 1.1.7.9.271 + TSAv3, SAMtools Version 1.2, Isas Smith –WatermanGotoh (Aligner) Version 6.2.1.25+ develop, Pisces Variant Caller Version 5.2.1.22, and Illumina
Annotation Engine 1.5.3.82 against human genome GRCh37/hg19. Alignment was performed
using the banded Smith-Waterman algorithm in the targeted gene regions. Primary Electrical
Disorders (PED) MASTR Plus was used to construct the libraries for arrhythmia gene panel
(Muiltiplicom, Agilent, Belgium). The libraries were multiplexed and sequenced on HiSeq 550
Rapid Run mode (Illumina). Fastq sequencing data were analyzed using Sentieon Workflow
pipeline on BaseSpace platform (Illumina), which uses the same mathematics used in the Broad
Institute’s BWA-GATK HaplotypeCaller Best Practice Workflow pipelines. The genomic VCF
files and BED files from both cardiomyopathy and PED panels were used for genomic variants
callings analyses on SVS software Version 8.0 (Golden Helix, Bozeman, MT) and Integrative
Genomics Viewer Version 2.4 (IGV) (Broad Institute).

Variant filtering and classification and comparison with general population
A list of the 29 target cardiomyopathy genes and 39 target arrhythmia genes are shown in
Supplemental Table 1. P/LP variants with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of greater than 0.01%
in the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC), TOPMED, and GnomAD were excluded from the
analysis. The ClinVar database (July 2019 release, NIH) was used to determine P/LP variants, and
all the P/LP variants were individually checked for the accuracy of classification. All the P/LP

variants with a read depth <15 were validated using Taqman genotyping assays (Thermo Fisher,
Waltham, MA). After variant classification, MAF of each benign, variants of unknown
significance (VUS), P/LP variants was compared with that of the general population using allele
frequency data from TOPMED, ExAC, GnomAD, 1000G, and UK10K.

Detailed evaluation of myocardial fibrosis
All the sections of myocardium in left ventricle (septal, anterior, posterior, lateral wall) in
consecutive cases whose myocardial tissues were available, and samples with or without P/LP in
HCM gene variants were stained with Masson Trichrome stain to evaluate for myocardial fibrosis
as described in the results section. Whole areas with myocardial fibrosis (which stains blue with
Masson Trichrome stain) were measured using ZEN software (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). See
Methods section in the Supplemental Materials for more details of the evaluation of myocardial
fibrosis.
Statistical analysis
Results for continuous variables with normal distribution were expressed as mean ± SD.
Normality of distribution was tested by the Shapiro–Wilk test. Variables with non-normal
distribution were expressed as median and 25th to 75th percentiles. Categorical data were
expressed as numbers (%) and analyzed by Chi-square test or Fisher's Exact tests. Student t test
was used to analyze the significance of differences for continuous variables with normal
distribution, whereas comparisons of variables with non-parametric distribution were performed by
the Kruskal-Wallis test. A p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. JMP software

RESULTS
Demographics and Heart Measurements of the Study Cohort
The study design is shown in Figure 1. From 1995-2015 the CVPath Sudden Death
Registry collected 5,262 autopsy hearts from OCME-MD. A total of 992 subjects were excluded
because they did not meet study demographic criteria (e.g. Age<18, non-African Americans or
non-Caucasians). Another 950 subjects were excluded because the CoD was a non-cardiac death,
or there was a lack of detailed information about final diagnosis or heart dimensions. Another
2,637 subjects were excluded because the CoD was a known cardiac cause such as obstructive
CAD (including but not limited to acute coronary syndromes), valvular disease, cardiomyopathy,
myocarditis, etc. Overall, 683 subjects with “normal” cardiac autopsy were adjudicated to have
suffered unexplained-SCD. Among these, 413 cases with acceptable DNA quality for sequencing
were chosen to approximately match the racial makeup of the original 683 subjects. The
demographic and clinical characteristics of 413 patients are shown in Supplemental Table 2. A
total of 63% of the patients were male, and the mean age at death was 41 (29-48) with 208 being
African Americans and 205 Caucasians.

Frequency of P/LP Genetic Variants for Cardiomyopathy and PED Disorders in the Study
Cohort
413 subjects with suspected unexplained-SCD were analyzed for 29 cardiomyopathy and
39 primary arrhythmia gene variants (Supplemental Table 1). In total, 143/413 (34.6%) subjects

had variants considered P/LP for cardiomyopathy (HCM and DCM) and/or PED (i.e. Brugada
Syndrome (BrS), LQTS, and ARVD). 102 (24.7%) subjects harbored 86 P/LP variants for
cardiomyopathies and 60 (14.5%) subjects carried 76 P/LP variants for PED. It is also worth
noting that 19 (4.6%) subjects carried variants for both conditions (Figure 2A-B). P/LP variants in
MYH7 (n=28/86, 33.3%) and MYBPC3 (n=28/86, 33.3%) were the most frequent cardiomyopathy
genes (Figure 2C), while variants in SCN5A (n=18/76, 23.7%), KCNQ1 (n=14/76, 18.4%),
KCNH2 (n=12/76, 15.8%), DSP (n=9/76, 11.8%), and RYR2 (n=8/76, 10.5%) were the most
frequently found arrhythmia genes consistent with BrS, LQTS, or ARVD (Figure 2D). More than
90% of P/LP variants in MYH7, TNNT2, TNNI3, SCN5A, KCNQ1, and KCNH2 were missense
variants, on the other hand, 33/37 (89%) P/LP variants in MYBPC3 and DSP were truncating
variants, including stop gained and different splice variants (Supplemental Figure 1), which is
consistent with the previous reports describing the type of mutations seen in these disorders 18, 19.
The clinical characteristics, circumstances of death, CoD, and relevant genetic information for
every subject with P/LP variants are provided in Supplemental Table 3.
When the MAF for benign and P/LP variants within genes examined in the current study
were compared to the general population, MAF for benign variants showed a linear relationship
between our SCD cohort and the general population (R2=0.8618, p<0.0001) (Figure 3A). In
contrast, MAF for P/LP was non-linear between SCD study cohort and general population
(R2=0.002, p=0.9851), and was highly enriched in the study cohort (Figure 3B). The median fold
enrichment in our SCD cohort for P/LP variants compared with general population were 121.0 and
138.5 [interquartile range (IQR) 63.0 - 272.0 and 63.3 – 297.9] for cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia
P/LP variants, respectively, which were significantly greater than for benign variants, which had a

median fold enrichment of 1.2 (0.7-1.8, p=ns)) (Figure 3C). Cumulatively, there were 431.4- and
200.0-fold enrichment in cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia variants in victims of unexplained SCD,
respectively (cumulative MAF of 0.1842 and 0.1436 in unexplained SCD cohort versus cumulative
MAF of 0.000427 and 0.000718 in the general population for cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia
P/LP variants, respectively).

Clinical Characteristics and Heart Dimensions in Subjects With or Without Pathogenic
/Likely Pathogenic Gene Variants
No significant difference was found in clinical characteristics and heart dimensions
between subjects with or without P/LP variants of either male or female sex (Table 1). Overall,
among subjects carrying P/LP variants, 48% were African Americans and 52% Caucasians, 40%
were female and 60% male.
Because of the high overall frequency of subjects with unexplained SCD carrying HCM
P/LP variants (i.e. 79/413, 19.1%), we conducted further sub-analysis in this group. We compared
heart/body dimensions in study cohort and subjects with HCM P/LP variants to 49 hearts with
pathologic diagnosis of HCM (from our collection), and found significant differences in most heart
measurements (Supplemental Table 4). When we examined the distribution of HCM P/LP variants
stratified by septal thickness across all cases of unexplained SCD, there was equal distribution of
HCM P/LP across all septal thicknesses (Figure 3D). Sections of left ventricular myocardium from
21 consecutive subjects with P/LP HCM gene variants and 22 consecutive subjects without P/LP
gene variants (median age; 39 vs. 31, respectively, p=0.2) were evaluated for evidence of
myocardial fibrosis. The percent area myocardial fibrosis in subjects with and without P/LP HCM

gene variants was similar [1.02 (0.76-1.55) % vs. 0.93 (0.70-1.40) %, respectively, p=0.5, Figure
3E, Supplemental Table 5]. Thus, in subjects with unexplained SCD, there was no relationship
between heart dimensions, myocardial fibrosis and the presence of P/LP HCM variants.

Racial Differences
Similar numbers of African Americans carried P/LP gene variants versus Caucasians
(68/208 [32.7%] vs. 75/205 [36.6%], respectively, p = 0.5) (Table 1). The numbers of P/LP gene
variant carriers by race are shown for both arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy genes in Figure 3F and
G, respectively. The most frequent P/LP variants in cardiomyopathy genes were MYBPC3 and
MYH7, similar between two races; however, the most frequent P/LP variants in arrhythmia genes
were different- SCN5A in African Americans and KCNH2/KCNQ1 in Caucasians (Figure 3 F-G).
Most of the P/LP variants were exclusive to one race [African Americans 41/75 (54.7%),
Caucasians 27/75 (36.0%) in arrhythmia genes; African Americans 33/84 (39.3%), Caucasians
39/84 (46.4%) in cardiomyopathy genes], whereas only 7/84 (9.3%) and 12/84 (14.3%) of P/LP
variants were seen in both races for arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy genes, respectively
(Supplemental Figure 2A-B).
MAF for benign variants in African American versus Caucasians was linear (R2=0.6607,
p<0.0001) (Supplemental Figure 2C). However, MAF for variants with unknown significance
(VUS) were commonly seen in African Americans (R2=0.0018, p<0.12) (Supplemental Figure
2D). We identified 3 VUS (2 in MYH7 and 1 in JUP) only found in African Americans, which
were >100-fold enriched in our cohort compared to the general population, suggesting they could
be associated with damaging function and risk of unexplained-SCD (Table 2).

DISCUSSION
SCD remains a major public health problem worldwide and is estimated to account for 1520% of all deaths 1, 2. The current study examined the association between cardiomyopathy and
arrhythmia genetic variants and unexplained-SCD and looked at whether race-based differences in
these genetic variants may exist. To the best of our knowledge this is the largest and most
comprehensive genetic autopsy study ever to be performed in the US. In our autopsy registry of
over 5,000 cases of suspected sudden cardiac death referred from OCME-MD, we identified 683
hearts from Caucasians and African Americans with unexplained SCD. Genetic analysis of 29
cardiomyopathy and 39 primary arrhythmia gene variants was performed in 413 subjects and
showed that slightly greater than one-third of subjects dying of unexplained-SCD in the State of
Maryland carried P/LP variants for cardiomyopathy or arrhythmia genes, representing a greater
than 100-fold enrichment in the frequency of these variants versus the general population.
Although our results were not combined with screening of surviving family members, our data
suggests that genetic causes may contribute to a far greater number of unexplained sudden cardiac
death cases in adults than previously appreciated. Although the relationship between PED gene
variants and risk of unexplained SCD is well recognized especially in younger adults 20-22, one
surprising finding of our study was the large numbers of subjects with unexplained SCD carrying
genetic variants for HCM (19.1%), which suggests a potential association of these genes with risk
of SCD in the absence of structural heart disease. In addition, our study is the first to examine the
frequency of P/LP variants in victims of unexplained SCD of African American and Caucasian
ancestry. Overall, African Americans had a similar frequency of P/LP HCM gene variants versus

Caucasians, but most variants were exclusive by race and African Americans were more likely to
harbor variants of unknown significance.
Previous autopsy studies of victims of sudden cardiac death have shown significant
variation in the numbers of subjects without abnormal cardiac exam sometimes as low as 5% when
older subjects are included. In one series with subjects similar in age (mean age 38) to our cohort,
187 of 902 cases (21%) had no evidence of cardiac pathology 23. We report a slightly lower
percent of patients with unexplained SCD (13%) although we excluded from evaluation younger
(i.e. <18 years of age), non-Caucasian, and non-African American subjects.
Autopsy studies have demonstrated the utility of performing genetic analysis of subjects
with unexplained-SCD, yielding diagnoses in up to one-third of young SCD cases. In the largest
series of 302 cases with unexplained sudden cardiac death (median age 24 years), molecular
autopsy for 77 genes for PED and cardiomyopathies, a P/LP variant was identified in 40 cases
(13%). The most common variants found were in gene for PED (catecholaminergic polymorphic
ventricular tachycardia (6%)) and congenital long QT syndrome (4%) with only 2% harboring
P/LP cardiomyopathy gene variants22. These data were generated from a multiple sources
including routine autopsy referrals from multiple medical centers in the Europe (United Kingdom,
New Zealand, Denmark, and Netherlands) which might affect diagnostic yield of molecular
autopsy since these were not all suspected sudden cardiac deaths. Another study of sudden cardiac
death which was prospective in nature consisted of autopsies from all cases of sudden cardiac
death in children and young adults ages 1 to 35 years in Australia and New Zealand. In cases of
unexplained-SCD, a clinically relevant gene mutation was found in 27% of cases with 17/131
carrying PED variants, 19/113 carrying cardiomyopathy variants, and 2/113 carrying both 7.

Although the definition of P/LP variants was different in this versus the present study, both
demonstrated the well-known association between PED and unexplained SCD. However, both
also report the same unexpected finding that a significant number of subjects dying of unexplained
SCD harbored cardiomyopathy variants.
Some may question whether carriers of P/LP variants for cardiomyopathy genes in this
study harbored underlying structural heart disease that might have been missed on autopsy. In the
current study, myocardial sections from at least 6 parts from the heart were routinely taken in all
cases, and a detailed histological examination was performed to rule out presence of any
cardiomyopathic process. Maron et al. demonstrated that ventricular septal and free wall thickness
were thicker in autopsy hearts when the thickness was compared with diastolic thickness measured
by echocardiogram that was performed prior to death 16. Therefore, wall thickness criteria used in
clinical echocardiography is not used as a diagnostic criteria for cardiomyopathies during autopsy
examination. Instead, increased septal/free wall ratio (>1.3) and/or abnormal histopathologic
findings such as myofiber disarray, myocyte hypertrophy, fibrosis (scarring), and thickening of
intramural coronary arteries are routinely used

24-29

. Moreover, wall thickness measurements in

our study were similar to what was shown in a previous study evaluated cardiac morphology of
765 normal hearts 15. Heart weight, which is known to become heavier as body mass index (BMI)
or body weight increases 15, 30, was also consistent with large autopsy studies of normal hearts 15, 31.
Even in the present day, SCD risk prediction remains difficult without precise factors
known to increase risk of death on an individual basis, especially in those without overt cardiac
disease. Yet, relatively few studies have been conducted in part because of the difficulty of
performing a full cardiac autopsy on a consistent basis and in a large number of subjects. Our data

in this study from the CVPath Sudden Death Registry represents the largest unexplained-SCD
study performed to date. Of the cardiomyopathy genes studied, the majority of mutations detected
were considered P/LP for HCM. Although it is a common genetic heart disorder and wellrecognized cause of SCD in those with overt heart disease, the role of genetics in risk prediction
remains uncertain, in those without clinically detectable disease 4, 5. The prevailing clinical
perception is that sudden death risk in HCM is related to the presence of ventricular hypertrophy.
However, case reports have documented the occurrence of SCD in those carrying genetic HCM
variants but without overt clinical disease 32. There is currently disagreement by consensus expert
panels about the significance HCM P/LP variants in those without overt cardiac disease 4, 5.
Studies of single families with specific variants are limited by numbers, length of follow-up, and
the possibility that shared genetic and yet unknown environmental modifiers may affect overall
risk. Indeed, large scale studies regarding the rate of SCD in individuals with genotype positive
phenotype negative have not been performed. The concordance in findings of the association of
cardiomyopathy P/LP variants and unexplained SCD between the study of Bagnall and our own,
the two largest studies to specifically examine the genetics of unexplained SCD, suggests further
work is needed to understand whether carrying certain cardiomyopathy genes without overt
clinical disease increases risk for unexplained SCD.
Study of different and underrepresented races (i.e. African Americans) is another unique
aspect of our study. Overall, African Americans harbored a similar frequency of P/LP variants
versus Caucasians for both cardiomyopathies and PED. While the most frequent P/LP variants in
cardiomyopathy genes were MYBPC3 and MYH7 for both races; most frequent P/LP variants in
arrhythmia genes were different- SCN5A in African Americans and KCNH2/KCNQ1 in

Caucasians with most of the P/LP variants were exclusive to one race. (Only 9.3% and 14.3% of
P/LP variants were seen in both races for arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy genes, respectively.)
Moreover, the prevalence in variants of uncertain significance were higher in African Americans
compared with Caucasians, which is consistent with the previous study 33. In our study, we found
in total 3 VUS which were >100x enriched in our African American unexplained-SCD cohort
compared to general population, suggesting a causal role in risk for unexplained SCD.
Our study has several limitations. First, a detailed family history of SCD was lacking and
thus the data collected relied only on the association of the presence of a variant and the
occurrence of death in one individual rather than within a familial cohort. Second, while all the
cases of the current study were collected from OCME-MD, there may be a referral bias and thus
the study findings may not accurately represent the frequency of genetic variants in victims of
SCD in the community.
In conclusion, this study represents one of the largest examinations reported of the
association between causative cardiomyopathy and arrhythmia genetic variants and unexplainedSCD. Over one-third of those with unexplained-SCD were carriers of P/LP variants. Our findings
with respect to both the association of unexplained SCD with cardiomyopathy genes and racespecific genetic variants suggest new avenues of study for this poorly understood entity.
