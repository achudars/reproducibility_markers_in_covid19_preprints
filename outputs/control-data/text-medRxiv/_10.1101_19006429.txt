ABSTRACT
The microbiome has been shown to affect the response to Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors

19

(ICIs) in a small number of cancers. Here, we sought to more broadly survey cancers to identify

20

those in which the microbiome will play a role using retrospective analyses. We created a

21

causal model for the relationship between medications, the microbiome and ICI response and

22

used it to guide the abstraction of electronic health records of 690 patients who received ICI

23

therapy for advanced cancer. Medications associated with changes to the microbiome including

24

antibiotics, corticosteroids, proton pump inhibitors, histamine receptor blockers, non-steroid anti-

25

inflammatories and statins were abstracted. We tested the effect of medication timing on overall

26

survival (OS) and evaluated the robustness of medication effects in each cancer. Finally, we

27

compared the size of the effect observed for antibiotics classes to taxa correlated with ICI

28

response and a literature review of culture-based antibiotic susceptibilities. Of the medications

29

assessed, only antibiotics and corticosteroids significantly associated with lower OS. The

30

hazard ratios (HRs) for antibiotics and corticosteroids were highest near the start of ICI

31

treatment but remained significant when given prior to ICI. Antibiotics and corticosteroids

32

remained significantly associated with OS even when controlling for multiple factors such as

33

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, Charlson Comorbidity Index score,

34

and stage. When grouping antibiotics by class, β-lactams showed the strongest association with

35

OS across all tested cancers. The timing and strength of these effects after controlling for

36

confounding factors are consistent with role for the microbiome in response to ICIs.

BACKGROUND
Treatment with Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors (ICIs) has improved patient outcomes

43

across a wide variety of cancers. Not all patients respond to these drugs and there is a need to

44

identify biomarkers of outcomes. Three recent studies have shown that microbes are associated

45

with response and overall survival (OS) in renal cell carcinoma (RCC), non-small cell lung

46

cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma (1–3). The microbiome may be a key player in response to ICI

47

therapy and a potential biomarker of treatment response.

48

The microbiome is known to interact with the immune system, but how it affects

49

response to ICIs is not understood. The effectiveness of ICI treatment relies on active T-cell

50

infiltration of a tumor; microbes have been associated with increased Tumor Infiltrating

51

Lymphocytes in an IL12-depended manner (4). However, other immune cells dampen response

52

to ICIs such as myeloid-derived suppressor cells and FOXP3 & CD4+CD25+ T-regulatory cells.

53

Another, systemic form of immune repression is characterized by the production of

54

prostaglandins (5–7).

55

Several medications commonly used during routine oncologic care and ICI treatment

56

can influence inflammation pathways and/or the microbiome. Corticosteroids (CS) affect both of

57

the aforementioned T-cell subtypes and the prostaglandin-related inflammatory pathways (8).

58

Additionally, antibiotics (ABx) have a direct effect on the microbiome by killing or halting the

59

growth of bacteria. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), histamine 2 blockers (H2Bs), non-steroid anti-

60

inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and CS have also been associated with changes in the

61

microbiome but, in contrast to antibiotics, this mechanism is indirect (9). PPIs, by inhibiting

62

gastric acid secretion, alter the pH of the gut and change the number and types of bacteria that

63

pass through the stomach (10). Notably, if the taxa enriched by the PPI-induced pH change are

64

also important for response to ICIs, then PPI treatment during ICI may influence clinical

65

outcomes. The effect of other medications on clinical response may be challenging to interpret

66

given that the effects may influence both the microbiome and ICI response.

67

In order to disentangle these complex interactions, we created a model of the

68

relationship between patient characteristics, medications that affect the microbiome,

69

inflammation, and survival. Second, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients who

70

received ICI therapy for advanced cancer between 2011 and 2017 including medications with

71

known effects on either the microbiome or its pathway toward affecting ICI response. Third, we

72

estimated the association for each medication with OS. Fourth, we analyzed the effects of

73

medications longitudinally, in order to decouple confounding variables at different time points.

74

Fifth, we controlled for variables that broadly describe differences in baseline statuses (e.g.

75

Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS)) of individuals who received

76

concomitant medications and those who did not. Sixth, we compared the associations across

77

several cancers, for which the medications are prescribed in subtly different ways that can be

78

leveraged to gain further insight into the causal effects. Finally, we related these results to the

79

microbes shown to be enriched or depleted in individuals who respond to ICIs. The combination

80

of these strategies gives layers of support to defining the role of the microbiome in the context

81

ICI treatment of cancer.

METHODS

84

Causal Model

85

We performed a literature review of the relationship between the microbiome and

86

response to ICIs and medications that affect the microbiome (Figure 1, references in Figure

87

S1). From these references, a causal model was then constructed such that the nodes

88

correspond to observable endogenous variables (Vi), as a subset of a set of U exogenous and

89

unobserved variables that affect the relationship between the microbiome and OS in patients

treated with ICIs. Directed edges denote a relationship between variables when the following

91

conditions are met: (1) there is a reported relationship between variables in which both variables

92

were either observed or defined by intervention, and (2) the relationship cannot be explained

93

through using an existing path. For example, Gopalakrishnan et al reported a correlation

94

between the microbiome and ICI response (1). This relationship exists in the graph as mediated

95

by the nodes Microbiome → T-cell Mediated Inflammation → ICI Response, therefore no edge

96

is drawn directly from Microbiome → ICI Response. The resulting directed acyclic graph was

97

constructed using the igraph and dagitty packages in R (11,12).

98

Retrospective data collection

99

We identified patients with advanced cancer treated between 2011 and 2017 at the Ohio

100

State University Comprehensive Cancer Center/Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital (OSUCCC-

101

James) who received at least one dose of ICIs as part of an IRB approved retrospective study

102

(OSU-2016C0070, OSU-2017C0063). Patient data were collected and housed in REDCap (13).

103

Medication timing, dose and names were collected from the electronic medical record

104

information warehouse and validated by manual chart review. Additional diagnoses prior to ICI

105

start were manually recorded from the Problem List, Medical History, and Encounter Diagnoses

106

in the electronic medical record and compiled using the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) (14),

107

which includes record of myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular

108

disease, cerebrovascular disease, dementia, chronic pulmonary disease, connective tissue

109

disease, ulcer disease, mild liver disease, diabetes, hemiplegia, moderate or severe renal

110

disease, moderate or severe liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis with ascites), or HIV AIDS.

111

Medication history curation

112
113

ABx and CS data were retrieved from the information warehouse within 180 days of ICI
start. All medications matching a comprehensive list of steroid generic and brand names were

114

collected with dates and routes of administration. Medications were filtered to those confirmed

115

to be administered and the results checked against a manually-curated subset of the records.

116

Survival Analysis

117

Overall survival (OS) was reported in days from the initiation of ICI to the date of death

118

or last follow-up. All univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted using the survminer

119

package in R (15,16). Univariate analyses used Kaplan-Meier survival curves with log-rank

120

tests. Multivariate analyses used Cox-Proportional Hazards models, defining the hazard

121

function for each patient k as:

122

ర ఱ ల ళ 

Where h(t) is the hazard function at time t = 1 to n, A is a binary indicator of antibiotic

123

use (+/- 28 days from start of ICIs), S is a binary indicator of corticosteroid use (+/- 28 days from

124

start of ICIs), B is BMI, E is the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score

125

(1-5), G is age, T is stage and X is sex. We constructed the models using the survival package

126

and evaluated model fits using a likelihood ratio tests in R (17–19).

127

Timing analysis

128

A 30-day sliding window was used to evaluate the effect of medication timing on the

129

association with OS. Patients prescribed medications within the window were compared to a

130

cohort of individuals who were not prescribed those medications within 180 days before or after

131

the start of ICI treatment. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were used to estimate a hazard ratio

132

(HR) of association with each treatment window, incremented by single-days, e.g. prescribed

133

180-150 days before ICI start vs no prescribed medications, and then prescribed 179-149 days

134

before ICI start vs no prescribed medications. HRs and confidence intervals were calculated in

135

the survival package and plotted with ggplot2 in R (18–20).

137

ABx and CS were collapsed into categories by DrugBank v5.0 accession numbers (21).

138

HRs were estimated for medication class and cancer combinations if the total sample set

139

included at least 20 individuals. Cox Proportional Hazards models for the effects of ABx and CS

140

class were used to allow for simultaneous estimation of the effects of more than one class,

141

when applicable. Plots showing prescriptions of more than one class were created with the

142

UpSetR package in R (22).

143

Regularized Cox Regression

144

Regularized Cox survival models for each cancer were implemented in the glmnet and

145

coxnet packages in R (23,24). We optimized the regularization parameter by coordinate descent

146

via 10-fold cross-validation and then tested the robustness of the parameter selection and

147

resulting covariates with 1000 bootstrap replicates of different random samples of the dataset

148

(23,24).

RESULTS

154

Causal Model

155

The relationships between clinical variables, medications, the microbiome, ICI response

156

and OS are strongly interconnected. Our literature review to predict their relationships (Figure

157

1) led to several hypotheses testable within retrospective data. First, medications that affect ICI

158

response via the microbiome will proceed through T-cell mediated inflammation (i.e. ABx →

159

Microbiome → T-cell mediated inflammation → ICI Response → OS). Second, the use of these

160

medications is driven by comorbidities, which must be controlled for. Here we attempt this using

161

the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) to capture and simplify several disease states (25). Non7

162

ICI-response effects on OS proceed through Prostaglandin Inflammation. For example, the path

163

CCI → ABx→ Microbiome → Prostaglandin Inflammation → OS may include sepsis, through

164

which inflammatory processes may lead to low blood pressure or multi-system organ failure and

165

therefore OS. Third, CS and ABx may have additive effects on ICIs through a collider effect on

166

T-cell mediated inflammation (i.e. ABx → Microbiome → T-cell mediated inflammation ← CS).

167

Finally, the clinical variables of stage, BMI, and age, and medications such as CS confound the

168

relationship between the microbiome and ICI response, mediated by Prostaglandin-based

169

inflammation (which itself is a collider), and therefore must be controlled for in order to infer the

170

role of the microbiome on OS (Figure 1).

171

Patient Characteristics

172

Retrospective analysis of electronic medical records from 2011 to 2017 at the OSUCCC-

173

James identified 690 patients treated with ICIs (Table 1). Most (76.6%) had a PS of 0 or 1 and

174

0-1 co-morbidities (CCI 0-1, 66.7%). The most common diagnoses were melanoma (28.5%) and

175

non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (23.4%). Cancers represented by fewer than 20 patients

176

were categorized as “Other” (23.4%). The majority of patients (90%) had metastatic disease. ICI

177

treatments included nivolumab in 52.8% of patients, ipilimumab in 18.0% and pembrolizumab in

178

15.1%.

179

Microbiome and inflammation-related concomitant medication use

180

Among the medications included in the causal model, ABx, CS, PPIs, H2Bs, statins and

181

NSAIDs were identified in this cohort. ABx were prescribed in 36% of patients within 28 days of

182

the start of ICIs (Table 1). The most commonly prescribed ABx were β-lactams (Figure S1). CS

183

were prescribed in 40% patients within 28 days of the start of ICIs. The most commonly

184

prescribed CS were dexamethasone and prednisone (Figure S2). PPIs were prescribed in 37%

185

of patients. Some patients received a single medication and no others during the study period,

186

however, more frequently patients received several medications, e.g. CS with PPI and ABx,

187

consistent with prophylaxis for developing an ulcer or pneumonia (Figure S3). The analysis

188

strategy first tested for an association of a medication with OS without controlling for

189

confounding effects of other medications and then further explored those medications with

190

strong associations.

191

Across all cancer types, patients who were prescribed ABx within 28 days of the start of

192

ICIs showed decreased OS (Figure 2A). This was also true of patients prescribed CS (Figure

193

2B), but not of patients prescribed other medications (Figure 2C). ABx showed a strong

194

negative correlation with OS in RCC, NSCLC, melanoma, and bladder cancer. CS showed a

195

strong negative correlation with OS in NSCLC, melanoma and other cancers. While other

196

medications were not significantly associated with OS across all cancers, several showed

197

significant associations with specific cancers. For example, H2Bs and NSAIDs associated with

198

decreased OS in sarcoma and NSCLC, respectively. On the other hand, PPIs and Statins

199

positively associated with OS in sarcoma. However, we observed the strongest associations for

200

ABx and CS, and therefore followed these medications in further analyses.

201

Timing of medication use

202

Next we focused on the timing of ABx and CS prescriptions and their associations with

203

OS in each cancer, using a 30-day sliding window (see Methods). ABx showed a greater HR

204

than CS over nearly the entire period, and both were negatively associated with OS (Figure

205

3A). ABx treatment showed the highest HR more than 100 days before the start of ICIs, a

206

second peak near day 50, and a third, lesser peak around day 0. CS showed a single, strong

207

peak at day 0. Similar effects have been observed previously, but with little consistency in the

208

time window tested (Table 2) (2,8,26–31). However, the majority of studies focused on a

209

window at or near the start of ICI treatment. We therefore focused the timing analyses around

210

ICI day 0 to capture the largest HR for both ABx and CS and to best compare the results to

211

previous findings, and then examined the effects across cancers and drug subclasses.

212
213

Antibiotics and Corticosteroids classes
The effect of ABx on treatment response in different cancer types was not consistently

214

associated with ABx class (Figure 3B). For example, β-lactams showed the highest HR in

215

melanoma, but vancomycin (oral) had the highest HR in head and neck squamous cell

216

carcinoma (HNSC). In addition, the overall effect of ABx was sometimes associated with a

217

single ABx subclass and sometimes distributed over many. Additionally, NSCLC strongly

218

associated with fluoroquinolone ABx, and this effect was stronger than the effect observed for

219

all ABx combined. By contrast, the combined effect of all ABx in melanoma was much stronger

220

than any individual ABx class. In fact, tetracycline was positively associated with OS in

221

melanoma patients, despite the overall effect of ABx being negatively associated. On the other

222

hand, the effects of CS classes on different cancers was more consistent (Figure 3C), though

223

these comparisons were often limited by the sample size. Particularly with small sample sizes,

224

confounding effects of patients receiving multiple drugs, e.g. ABx and CS, may dominate

225

associations with OS. We therefore used combined models of ABx and CS to examine the

226

effects of each.

227

Combined modeling of ABx and CS, controlling for covariates

228

Models containing both ABx and CS showed that both are significantly associated with

229

OS. A Kaplan-Meier curve stratifying patients by ABx, CS, or both, showed nearly identical

230

intermediate effects of either ABx or CS, and an additive combined effect (Figure 4A). We next

231

sought to control for confounding covariates using a Cox Proportional Hazards model. Including

232

CCI, PS, BMI, sex, stage, and age in the model confirmed that ABx and CS remained highly

233

significant, as were PS, BMI and age (Figure 4B). This suggests that ABx and CS are affecting

234

OS in the context of ICI therapy by a mechanism other than that which is captured by PS, BMI

235

or age, and is consistent with the microbiome parent to T-cell inflammation and child of ABx

236

(Figure 1).

237

In order to estimate the effects of ABx and CS within each cancer, we applied a method

238

that (1) allowed different covariates to be included in each cancer, commensurate with the

239

different clinical features of each cancer, and (2) removed uninformative variables, increasing

240

the power for those cancers with smaller numbers of patients in this dataset. In addition, we

241

repeated the analysis with different random samplings of the data in order to estimate the

242

robustness of the variable selection. We found ABx to consistently and significantly associate

243

with OS in bladder cancer, melanoma and RCC, but not in HNSC, NSCLC, or sarcoma. The HR

244

was above 1 in each of the cancers where ABx was a consistently-selected covariate.

245

Melanoma was notable in that all variables were consistently selected, with ABx showing the

246

highest HRs (Figure 4C).

247

The relationship between ABx, OS, and the microbiome

248

The bacterial taxa that showed the strongest enrichment in responders or non-

249

responders to ICIs were selected from the literature and combined into a phylogenetic tree

250

(Figure 5) (1,2,32). The taxa spanned several phyla and few ranks were consistently enriched

251

in either responders or non-responders. For example, Firmicutes was found to be enriched in

252

responders (1), but within the phylum are several taxa found to be enriched in non-responders

253

(2,32). An exception to this was Bacteroidetes, which was found to be enriched in non-

254

responders and each of the four species in the phylum were also enriched in non-responders

255

(1,2). We performed a literature review of ABx susceptibilities for each of these taxa to estimate

256

whether the size of the HR of the ABx would relate to the taxa for which it is active. For

257

example, an ABx that target only bacteria enriched in non-responders may be beneficial

258

because it may shift the community toward those taxa enriched in responders. On the other

259

hand, if the overall diversity of the microbiome is important, broad-spectrum ABx may have

260

higher HRs than narrow-spectrum.

261

The ABx class with the largest HR across all cancers was the β-lactams. Within this

262

group category are the cephalosporins, which have a relatively narrow spectrum of activity and

263

a unique pattern relative to other ABx classes. The cephalosporins are ineffective against the

264

Bacteroidetes, found to be enriched in non-responders, but so were ABx such as vancomycin

265

and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SXT). However, unlike vancomycin and SXT,

266

cephalosporins effectively target A. muciniphila, which was shown to causally modify response

267

to ICIs. Cephalosporins are also ineffective against several Firmicutes, similar to clindamycin,

268

macrolides and metronidazole (Figure 5).

269
270

DISCUSSION

271

The effects of medications or other variables are difficult to parse in a dynamic setting

272

such as during treatment for cancer. We used a variety of methods to show that ABx and CS

273

are significantly associated with decreased OS in several cancer types and that these results

274

are consistent with mediation via the gut microbiome.

275

The association of CS with ICI response and OS remains controversial. Our observed

276

association is consistent with other observations of decreased OS in NSCLC (8). However,

277

Riccuiti et al showed no effect of CS on OS in NSCLC when given on the same day as ICI start,

278

when the CS was prescribed for reasons other than “cancer-related palliative indications” (33).

279

Our records lack some variables needed to replicate those results, however our results are

280

consistent with aspects those findings. For example, dexamethasone treatment showed a

281

strong negative association with OS across several cancer types, consistent with its use for

282

brain metastases and anorexia, which are all indicators of poor clinical outcome. On the other

283

hand, several of our analyses demonstrated associations between CS and OS that may not be

284

285

showed similar results when restricting CS medications to a single day, but a larger effect when

286

a wider time window was used (Table 2). Our second causal strategy, controlling for covariates,

287

cannot be directly compared because our dataset did not include central nervous system

288

metastases. However, when we control for metastatic stage and PS, the CS association

289

remains. Our third causal strategy, comparisons between cancers, shows that the CS

290

association with OS is observed in cancers for which brain metastases are not common, such

291

as RCC, and for specific CS not typically used for brain metastases, such as

292

methylprednisolone in HNSC. This suggests that understanding the association between CS

293

and the response to ICIs may require more granular assessment of CS types (i.e. rather than

294

collapsing to 10 mg prednisone equivalent) and cancers.

295

We applied the same logical framework to ABx treatment to demonstrate an effect on

296

OS. Unlike CS, the majority of studies have found an association between ABx use and ICI

297

response, independent of the time window (Table 2). Our longitudinal analysis showed a global

298

maximum HR well before the start of ICIs, consistent with the ABx effects persisting for long

299

periods. Given this result, it is unlikely that acute illnesses drive the association between ABx

300

and OS. However, a recent prospective study found that ABx given currently with ICI treatment

301

did not significantly affect OS for a group of patients with lung, skin, or several other cancers

302

(26) (Table 2). We observe lower HRs for the effect of ABx after ICI start, however it remains

303

significant until approximately 120 days post ICI start. We note that within cancers the effect of

304

ABx is highly variable (Figure 4C); the difference may be due to the composition of the cohorts

305

(e.g. more patients with bladder cancer, where ABx has a strong effect, and fewer with NSCLC,

306

where the effect is less).

307

When controlling for illness-related covariates that report on the overall health status of

308

the individual (e.g. CCI, PS) the effect of ABx remained significant. Third, the associations of

309

ABx and OS were observed across cancer types (e.g. patients with bladder cancer versus

310

melanoma). A larger fraction of bladder cancer patients were treated with ABx than any other

311

cancer (56%), consistent with their use for urinary tract or as prophylaxis for invasive urologic

312

procedures. On the other hand, melanoma patients treated with ABx were the smallest fraction

313

of any cancer (25%), consistent with this population being less likely to undergo procedures in

314

which prophylactic ABx are used. It is reasonable to suspect that melanoma patients treated

315

with ABx are therefore more compromised than those not treated with ABx. However, an effect

316

of ABx remains, even for bladder cancer. Although it remains probable that the cohorts who

317

receive ABx are different from those who did not in ways that have not been controlled for in

318

analyses, these three analyses add confidence to the association of ABx with OS in the context

319

of ICIs.

320

We next related the strength of the association of ABx classes with OS and the microbes

321

that those ABx classes affect. The β-lactam ABx were shown to have the strongest association

322

with OS across cancer types. The literature review of antibiotic susceptibilities showed that this

323

diverse class is effective against the Gram-positive phylum Firmicutes. The literature review of

324

the bacterial taxa associated with response to ICIs, showed that the Firmicutes are enriched in

325

responders to ICIs. Moreover, β-lactams are not consistently effective against members of the

326

phylum Bacteroidetes, which was found to be enriched in non-responders. This suggests that

327

the β-lactams may show the strongest signal across all cancers in our dataset because they

328

disrupt the microbiome in such a way that they reduce response to ICIs by depleting the

329

Firmicutes more so than the Bacteroidetes.

330

The association between ABx prescriptions and OS that we observe is consistent with

331

direct measurements of the microbiome and response to ICIs (1–3). However, there is no

332

consensus for which taxa are enriched in the responders to ICIs (Figure 5). For example, there

333

is causal evidence for Akkermansia muciniphila increasing response to ICIs, however, it was not

334

among the most enriched in the other datasets (1,2,32). Nonetheless, agreement can be

335

observed at broader taxonomic characterizations. Non-responders are enriched for taxa in the

336

phylum Bacteroidetes and this is consistent with the strength of association we see for different

337

classes of ABx (1,2). Narrow spectrum β-lactams (e.g. cephalosporins), which show the

338

strongest association with OS, are effective against Firmicutes (enriched in responders) but less

339

so against Bacteroidetes (enriched in non-responders).

340

The results presented here contrast with several assumptions gathered from the

341

literature and described by the causal model (Figure 1). First, we found that ABx and CS are

342

the only medications significantly associated with OS, despite the inclusion of several

343

medications associated with changes to the microbiome (Figure 2). This may be due to the

344

types of changes incurred (e.g. PPIs may not significantly change the abundances of those taxa

345

linked to ICI response) or the strength of the effect amid the noise in the data. However, the

346

other two hypotheses were borne out by the analyses.

347

The CS and ABx medications showed an additive effect on OS, consistent with a collider

348

interaction in the model (Figure 4A). Also, there was an effect of ABx after controlling for many

349

covariates, consistent with its direct effect on the microbiome and the microbiome playing a role

350

in ICIs (Figure 4B). This result was consistent with the relationship between the strength of the

351

ABx signal and the bacterial taxa susceptible to that ABx (Figure 5).

352

Limitations

353

A key challenge in this and other retrospective analyses is inferring causal relationships

354

in non-randomized cohorts. For example, patients who receive medications such as antibiotics

355

may be quite different from those who do not. However, it is difficult to imagine an ethical trial

356

that could randomize treatment with ABx in this setting. Therefore, retrospective analyses may

357

be the best option until direct measurements of the microbiome are widely available. We used a

358

variety of methods to show that ABx and CS are significantly associated with decreased OS

359

across a variety of cancers and that these results are consistent with a role for the gut

360

microbiome.

361

Our study remains limited by being unable to account for important factors known to

362

affect OS in the context of ICI treatment. For example, the complete ABx history of patients --

363

much longer than the windows reported here -- are very likely of consequence. Several groups

364

have studied the recovery of microbiome diversity following ABx exposure and results show

365

reasonable recovery 90 days later (34,35). However, multiple courses of ABx prevented such a

366

recovery; i.e. diversity returned to baseline after one treatment with ABx, but not after a second

367

ABx treatment within 60 days (36). It is therefore possible that individuals who show extreme

368

effects of ABx treatment are beyond the time scale of this study. Without baseline microbiome

369

diversity measures we are unable to capture such information. Similarly, estimating the effects

370

of ABx on communities from data on microbes in isolation is, at best, approximate. A better

371

understanding of how ABx affect complex communities is needed. Other limitations include our

372

small sample size relative to the heterogeneity in the data. Future directions should capture

373

variables such as the presence of brain metastases, tumor biomarkers such as tumor

374

mutational burden and PD-1/PDL-1 status, and outcome variables like ICI response or the

375

number of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.

376
377
378

CONCLUSIONS
ABx and CS, but not other medications known to affect the microbiome, are associated

379

with reduced OS when administered near the start of ICI treatment. Our results show this finding

380

several cancer types, and for several subclasses of these drugs. These results are consistent

381

with a role of the microbiome in response to ICIs and identify clinical settings where the

382

microbiome is likely to play the largest role, namely NSCLC, melanoma, RCC, HNSC, and

383

bladder cancer. A clear understanding of which microbes are important for ICI responses and in

384

what cancers will require the collection of microbiome samples across a wide variety of clinical

385

settings. However, some information can be gathered by indirect means, which identifies the

386

settings where the microbiome is likely to have the greatest effects. Medications that affect the

387

microbiome given concomitantly with ICIs provide evidence for where microbes play a role.

388

Further work is needed to identify which microbes are important and identify solutions to

389

mitigate these effects and perhaps promote greater response to ICIs.
