Abstract
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has proposed a regulatory framework for
modifications to artificial intelligence/machine learning-based software as a medical device
(SaMD). We analysed the 125 non-duplicate and non-spam public comments on the
proposed framework and found that industry and other parties with a potential financial
interest contributed a minimum of 63% of comments and that the absence of a conflict of
interest could be confirmed in only 8%. Despite the FDA’s stated commitment to using
scientific evidence in the rule-making process, the vast majority of submitted comments
(86%) did not cite any scientific literature, just 4% cited a systematic review or metaanalysis, and no comments indicated whether a systematic process was used to identify
relevant literature. We recommend that the FDA requires disclosure of conflicts of interest
in comments in the future. As the framework continues to be modified, engagement from
non-conflicted parties and better use of scientific evidence may help to ensure the
development of a regulatory system that best promotes patient interests.

Introduction
Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) are increasingly prevalent in the
healthcare literature1. Several medical devices incorporating AI/ML have now been
approved by the US FDA, including an autonomous diagnostic system that does not require
input from a clinician for interpretation2. Because artificial intelligence may learn and adapt
to additional data in real time to improve performance, regulators have questioned the
suitability of traditional medical device regulatory pathways for AI/ML containing devices.

Changes that might affect a device’s performance under the current regulatory framework
would require further review from the FDA, which is time-consuming and may not suit the
iterative modification that often characterises software development and deployment. The
FDA has therefore proposed a regulatory framework for modifications to AI/ML-based
SaMD3 (Box 1). Because the FDA is one of the most prominent regulatory agencies, other
agencies are likely to follow FDA frameworks. It is therefore essential that the framework
reflects and promotes patient interests and safety.

Box 1: Summary of AI/ML framework: “Proposed Regulatory Framework for Modifications to
Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD)
- Discussion Paper and Request for Feedback”3

“The FDA released the first discussion paper on April 2nd 2019 outlining a framework for
regulating modifications to SaMD that use Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML). The comment period closed on June 3rd 2019. The proposed framework describes:
-

The extent to which FDA's traditional framework for assessing modifications to
devices should apply to AI/ML SaMD

-

Modification categories for continuously learning AI/ML SaMD and a proposed “predetermined change control plan” in pre-market submissions: when seeking
regulatory approval, manufacturers would also submit a plan for modifications,
including model retraining, as part of the initial pre-market review.

-

Expectations for manufacturers to monitor the real-world performance of AI/ML
systems and periodically report updates to users and to the FDA on what changes
have been implemented.

The evaluation, monitoring, and management of risks from AI/ML modifications
from initial pre-market submission through to post-market performance.

Hypothetical examples of modifications and their applicability to the proposed
framework.”

The development of FDA regulations and guidance is intended to be transparent and
involves opportunities for the public to assess and comment on proposed rules before they
are finalised. Comments can be submitted by anyone and are considered by the FDA in
subsequent drafts and final rulings. However, there is significant potential for conflicts of
interest (COI) among commenters, who could serve to benefit financially from particular
outcomes, such as lower regulatory scrutiny.

Therefore, we evaluated the prevalence of financial COI in comments on the recent
proposed AI/ML device framework. There is a huge academic literature available related to
AI/ML, which could be used to inform the development of new regulations, and the FDA
explicitly look for ‘good science’ in submitted comments4. We also, therefore, examined the
citation of scientific evidence, including of systematic reviews, to determine whether there
is opportunity to increase and improve its use in comments.

Results
130 public comments were submitted in response to the proposed regulatory framework at
the time we downloaded data (8th August 2019), of which 5 were duplicates, nearduplicates, or spam, leaving 125 comments for analysis. Combining industry, mixed
associations (which include representatives of industry) and other contributors with

identified COI revealed that at least 79 (63%) comments came from parties with potential
COI (Table 1). For 36 comments, (29%) it was not clear, and the absence of a conflict could
be confirmed in only 10 comments (8%). The length of comments and proportion of
comments citing scientific evidence was similar across submitters regardless of financial
interest (Table 1).

Table 2 summarises the categories of organisations or individuals submitting comments.
Industry submitted 64 (51%) comments. Of the 61 non-industry comments, we were able to
determine whether or not a COI was present in 25 submissions (41%). Of these 25, conflicts
for 15 were identified, and no conflicts were found for 10. No conflicts were disclosed in any
of the non-industry comments.

Of the 125 comments, 108 (86%) did not cite scientific literature, 15 (12%) cited at least one
paper published in an academic journal, and two (1.6%) cited article pre-prints but not
papers in academic journals. Five (4.6%) comments cited a systematic review or metaanalysis, and none of the 125 comments reported any systematic method for identifying the
literature referenced in the document.

Discussion
Financial Conflicts of Interest
Industry and other submitters with COI comprised nearly two thirds of the comments on the
proposed FDA framework. We found no evidence that submitters without a financial
interest were more likely to cite scientific evidence or contribute more comprehensive
comments.

COI may influence policy. An analysis of comments on the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention’s (CDC’s) 2016 guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain revealed that
29% of submitting organisations had received funding from opioid manufacturers5. These
organisations, as well as organisations that had received funding from other life science
companies or whose funding source was not known, were significantly less supportive of
the guidelines than organisations with no funding from industry. Proposed changes to the
European medical device framework in 2008 included more rigorous testing and centralised
regulation by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Of the 200 responses received, 117
were from industry and were largely against the involvement of the EMA, in contrast to the
support from doctors, academics, patients and consumers6. EMA involvement was
subsequently decided against. COI can also influence the reporting of results of clinical
research7,8.

Identifying conflicts was not straightforward. For anonymous commenters, or those that
provide a name but no organisation, it is impossible to identify potential conflicts. The
regulations.gov ‘Tips for submitting effective comments’ document does not mention
disclosure of COI9, nor does the FDA’s information page on submitting comments4. Although
disclosure will not necessarily change the interpretation of information, it is an important
first step in improving transparency. We recommend that the FDA requests a statement of
COI in comments, which would help to further determine the extent of COI in future public
consultations. They could also reject anonymous comments unless there is a clear reason
that anonymity would improve comment quality.

Scientific Evidence and Academic Engagement
Despite the FDA4 and federal government9 iterating that their decisions are based on
science (as well as law and reason), scientific evidence of any sort was not cited across the
vast majority of comments. The number of academics submitting responses was also low, in
contrast to the vast and growing amount of published academic research on AI/ML in
healthcare (reviewed in 1). However, it is possible to support almost any argument by
cherry-picking the literature. Systematic reviews somewhat overcome this problem by
increasing the objectivity of assessment of literature to answer a particular question10,11;
however, only five of 125 comments cited a systematic review. There are very few
systematic reviews available in this field, and systematic reviews, or indeed any research
literature, may not, therefore, be available for all aspects of proposed regulations. In such
cases, systematic searches could have been performed; however, such searches was not
reported in any submitted comments.

Regardless, an increase in the number of reasoned and logical comments from (preferably
non-conflicted) academic researchers would be worthwhile. Financial interests will tend to
pull in a uniform direction and a lack of scientific evidence will not prevent this bias from
manifesting. Though there will still be bias in opinions expressed for other non-financial
reasons (such as personal experiences or political or intellectual beliefs), it will tend to be
multi-directional and therefore less problematic.

In other areas of medical device regulation, there is literature available evaluating or
critiquing regulatory frameworks12–14. Such work is valuable, but once regulations have been
developed it is a laborious process for them to be changed. AI/ML regulation is in an early

stage where the research literature could be used prospectively to help to define the best
course of action and reduce the probability of issues occurring in the future.

We encourage greater participation by academics in this and other regulatory development.
Participation should come both from experts in the technology in question, as well as from
the broader medical community that will use and evaluate it. Continued input from
associations and the greater use of scientific evidence, in particular that from systematic
reviews, by all commenters, could be valuable.

Limitations
First, because of the early stage of and diversity of topics in the proposed regulatory
framework, we could not categorise it as either pro- industry or not, which in turn made
assessing the extent of agreement of commenters with the proposed framework
meaningless. This is in contrast to other work like that discussed above, which was able to
quantify the directionality of opinion and its association with conflicts5,6. In our discussion,
we have therefore assumed that industry interests will tend to be overrepresented in
comments that are submitted by parties with a financial COI.

Second, we have access only to the information externally submitted to FDA by the public,
and undoubtedly further evidence is considered internally. However, the purpose of public
consultations is to gather information from the public to inform regulation. It is important to
have high quality, reasoned, objective and transparent information so that a positive impact
on internal decision making can be expected.

Conclusion
We found that the prevalence of financial COI in commenters was high. For a large number
of comments, we were unable to determine whether or not a conflict was present, and
disclosure of COI was non-existent. The proportion of academic submitters was relatively
low, and the use of scientific evidence to support comments was sparse. These findings
paint a relatively bleak picture and the process to change FDA policy, for example regarding
policies on COI disclosure, is likely to be slow.

There is, however, a significant opportunity for researchers working in AI/ML in healthcare
to have an immediate impact on the development of rules that are based on scientific
evidence and that prioritise patient benefit. The regulations.gov guidance on commenting
states: “Although public support or opposition may help guide important public policies,
agencies make determinations for a proposed action based on sound reasoning and
scientific evidence rather than a majority of votes. A single, well-supported comment may
carry more weight than a thousand form letters”9. The development of the AI/ML
framework is still in its early stages, and there is, therefore, still a high likelihood of being
able to contribute to and influence it15. If readers of this article provide high quality
comments in future developments of the proposed rules, supported by sound scientific
evidence, they may well be weighted more highly in decision making than other comments
and directly impact the framework under development. The FDA should encourage
disclosure of conflicts, and in the absence of a requirement submitters should disclose
proactively. Our recommendations are also relevant to public consultations for other areas
of regulation.

Methods
The docket folder for comment submission for the “Proposed Regulatory Framework for
Modifications to Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Based Software as a
Medical Device (SaMD) - Discussion Paper and Request for Feedback” 16 was accessed 8th
August 2019 and meta-data for all comments exported to Microsoft Excel. Any comments
submitted after this date, which was after the comment period closed, were not included in
analysis. Individual comments were subsequently accessed via the docket by following the
link in the Excel export. We conducted a pilot study in which JAS developed a data
extraction protocol by reading and preliminarily analysing all comments submitted on the
proposed framework. Two reviewers (REA and ZUH) then independently extracted data
from all comments according to the extraction protocol (available on Open Science
Framework: https://osf.io/g423d/). We accessed the data from August to October 2019 and
the comment order was randomised for each reviewer. JAS consolidated any discrepancies
between the reviewers. Some minor changes were made to the data extraction procedure
during the consolidation process; these are described in the extraction protocol. JAS
extracted and checked any new data as required.

We recorded a category for each organisation or individual submitting a comment (e.g.
industry, association, academia, etc), whether a conflict of interest (COI) could be identified,
and, if so, whether it was disclosed. A conflict of interest was defined as occurring when an
organisation or individual had financial interests that could be impacted by the proposed
regulatory framework.

We determined COI for academic contributors by identifying web pages that highlighted a
link with industry (for example an advisory board position) and examining COI disclosures or
receipt of grant funding from industry in recent publications (published in the last two
years). For healthcare professionals and individual consumers, we also searched the open
payments database (https://openpaymentsdata.cms.gov/) for payments from industry. For
associations, we determined the presence of COI based on the self-identification of the
association (e.g. we are a trade association), the members of the association (whether any
of the member organisations were from industry), and the presence of COI amongst authors
of comments representing the association, in the same way as done for academics. If there
were no listed authors on the comment, we also looked at the board members and
considered the organisation to have a financial interest if greater than half of the members
had a COI. Industry submitters were considered to have a COI. Where we could identify a
specific statement that academic submitters did not have COI in a publication in the last two
years, we recorded that there was no COI. When no conflict could be identified for an
association, we assumed that there was no conflict. We assumed that submitters from the
federal government did not have a COI. When the presence or absence of a conflict could
not be determined according to these criteria, it was recorded as unknown.

For industry submitters, we assumed that COI disclosure would not be required because the
COI is self-evident, but that for any other conflicted submitters a disclosure would be
required for the FDA to be aware of the COI. Therefore, for non-industry submissions with
COIs, we recorded whether or not the COI was disclosed.

As a proxy for the use of scientific evidence in comments, we recorded whether comments
cited articles published in academic journals, pre-prints (which included conference
proceedings), systematic reviews or meta-analyses, and whether any systematic search was
reported to identify any documents or literature. We also recorded the length of each
comment to give an indication of its comprehensiveness.

Analysis was descriptive and was conducted in R v3.6.1 [ref: 17]. The R code and dataset are
provided on Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/g423d/). The analysis was reproduced
in Python independently.
