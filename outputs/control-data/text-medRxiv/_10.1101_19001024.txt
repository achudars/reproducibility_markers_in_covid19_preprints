Abstract
Background: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature death worldwide.
Effective and individualized treatment requires exact knowledge about both risk factors and risk
estimation. Most evidence for risk prediction currently comes from population-based studies on first
incident cardiovascular events. In contrast, little is known about the relevance of risk factors for the
outcome of patients with established CVD or those who are at high risk of CVD, including patients
with type 2 diabetes. In addition, most studies focus on individual diseases, whereas less is known
about disease overarching risk factors and cross-over risk.
Aim: The aim of BeLOVE is to improve short- and long-term prediction and mechanistic
understanding of cardiovascular disease progression and outcomes in very high-risk patients, both in
the acute as well as in the chronic phase, in order to provide the basis for improved, individualized
management.
Study design: BeLOVE is an observational prospective cohort study of patients of both sexes aged
>18 in selected Berlin hospitals, who have a high risk of future cardiovascular events, including
patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute stroke (AS), acute heart failure
(AHF), acute kidney injury (AKI) or type 2 diabetes with manifest target-organ damage. BeLOVE
includes 2 subcohorts: The acute subcohort includes 6500 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI within
2-8 days after their qualifying event, who undergo a structured interview about medical history as
well as blood sample collection. The chronic subcohort includes 6000 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or
AKI 90 days after event, and patients with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and target-organ damage. These
patients undergo a 6-8 hour deep phenotyping program, including

detailed clinical phenotyping

from a cardiological, neurological and metabolic perspective, questionnaires including patientreported outcome measures (PROMs)as well as magnetic resonance imaging. Several biological
samples are collected (i.e. blood, urine, saliva, stool) with blood samples collected in a fasting state,
as well as after a metabolic challenge (either nutritional or cardiopulmonary exercise stress test).
Ascertainment of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) will be performed in all patients using
a combination of active and passive follow-up procedures, such as on-site visits (if applicable),
telephone interviews, review of medical charts, and links to local health authorities. Additional
phenotyping visits are planned at 2, 5 and 10 years after inclusion into the chronic subcohort.
Future perspective: BeLOVE provides a unique opportunity to study both the short- and long-term
disease course of patients at high cardiovascular risk through innovative and extensive deep
phenotyping. Moreover, the unique study design provides opportunities for acute and post-acute
inclusion and allows us to derive two non-nested yet overlapping sub-cohorts, tailored for upcoming
research questions. Thereby, we aim to study disease-overarching research questions, to understand
crossover risk, and to find
high cardiovascular risk.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of premature death worldwide and also the most
common

cause

of

permanent

disability

[1,2].

It

is

associated

with

organ

dysfunction,

multiple

sequelae, impairment of quality of life as well as enhanced frailty and dependency in the elderly.
Effective and individualized treatment requires exact knowledge about both risk factors and risk
estimation. Most evidence for risk prediction currently comes from population-based studies on the
risk of first incident cardiovascular events, such as the Framingham Heart Study[3], or the SCORE
project[4]. In contrast, less is known about patients with established CVD or those who are at high
risk of CVD, including patients with type 2 diabetes and target-organ damage. Currently, guidelines
classify these patients as “high risk”, and assume that they have a >20% 10-year risk of recurrent
events [5]. However, recent studies suggest that risk among these patients may vary substantially
from <10% to >30%[6].

Cardiovascular diseases, such as acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute heart failure (AHF) acute
kidney injury (AKI), or acute stroke (AS) share many risk factors [7], including hypertension, lipid
disorders, obesity, smoking, and others. Type 2 diabetes is also a major cardiovascular risk factor,
and, when combined with target-organ damage, considered a high

risk

condition equivalent to

manifest CVD [8–11]. Survivors of cardiovascular events often experience recurrences of the same
disease and have largely increased risks for other cardiovascular events (crossover-risk) [12–17]. Not
surprisingly then, an optimized therapy for one CVD condition may also reduce the

risk for all

vascular events and disease manifestations[18,19]. Still, despite these similarities e.g. cerebro- and

of

predisposing risk factors for developing a certain vascular disease [22–24]. For example, smoking and
LDL-cholesterol levels are more strongly related to the risk of ACS as compared to AS, whereas
hypertension is a stronger risk factor in AS than in ACS. Substantial differences also exist between
the

pathomechanisms

underlying

these

diseases

[25];

e.g.

atherosclerosis

reveals

considerable

disparities between carotid and coronary artery disease [26]. Although the assessment [27] and
prevention [1] of CVD risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking have long
been studied, preventive strategies often remain controversial [28–30].

More personalized risk stratification is necessary, which, however, requires a better understanding
of the role of different risk factors in individuals. Deep phenotyping, where data is collected on the
patient health status far beyond traditional risk factors, is likely to add a new dimension to subgroup
identification

and

risk

stratification.

For

as

immunological

processes, [31] metabolic parameters [32] or the gut microbiome [33]. are largely understudied.
Although in recent years deep phenotyping efforts have been part of larger scale population-based
cohort studies, this is less so in the field of secondary prevention, and it is usually restricted to
specific disease cohorts, whereas there is a paucity of studies that investigate cardiovascular disease
overarching risk factors despite clear connections [34,35].

Therefore, we have initiated the Berlin Long-term Observation of Vascular Events(BeLOVE) study, a

The overall aim of BeLOVE
The aim of BeLOVE is to improve short- and long-term prediction and mechanistic understanding of
cardiovascular disease progression and risk in high-risk patients, both in the acute as well as the
chronic phase. The objective of BeLOVE is to provide the basis for improved, individualized risk
management in the long and short term.

Study design
BeLOVE is a prospective cohort study of patients with a high risk of future cardiovascular events,
including patients with a history of acute coronary syndrome (ACS), acute stroke (AS), acute heart
failure (AHF), or acute kidney injury (AKI) or patients with type 2 diabetes with target-organ damage
(T2DM). BeLOVE encompasses
(subcohort 1)

two partly overlapping subcohorts (Figure 1). The acute subcohort

will recruite up to 6500 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI up to 8 days after their

qualifying event. They will undergo a short structured interview on their demographics and medical
history, a short cognitive test as well as quality of life measures,blood sampling. Patients will then be
followed long term for up to 10 years by annual telephone interviews.

The chronic subcohort (subcohort 2)

includes up to 6000 patients with ACS, AS, AHF, or AKI 90 days

after their event, as well as patients with type 2 diabetes and target-organ damage. These patients
will undergo a 7-8 hour deep phenotyping program, including but not limited to the collection of
biological samples (i.e. blood, urine, saliva, stool), and detailed questionnaires including PatientReported Outcome Measures (PROMs). Patients will also undergo a series of imaging procedures,
including ultrasound, optical coherence tomography and magnetic resonance imaging. Follow-up of
all patients is planned to continue for up to 10 years with annual telephone interviews, as well as
visits to our clinical research unit 90 days, as well as 2, 5 and 10 years after the acute event or
corresponding timeframes for T2DM. Patients are recruited from the Charité university medical
center within the city of Berlin, Germany. The main phase of the study will start in November 2019
and is expected to recruit for up to 7 years..

physician, patients who do not speak German, or cannot provide written informed consent, are
similarly excluded from participation.

Timing of inclusion
BeLOVE has two distinct time windows for

inclusion. The first time window, referred to as “acute

inclusion" marks the start of the acute subcohort. Acute inclusion is possible for patients with one of
the four acute diseases (i.e. AS, ACS, AHF, and sustained AKI). These patients are contacted within 7
days after their qualifying event (goal day 1 - 2). This translates to a time window of up to 10 days
after the start of the AKI episode to contact AKI patients, given the requirement of the AKI episode
lasting at least 72 hours. Patients receive information regarding the goal and design of the study in
both verbal and written form. After at least 12-24 hours, patients may sign the written informed
consent. The data collection in the acute phase is limited in scope and comprises a limited set of
questionnaires regarding pre-existing risk factors, agreement to use routine data produced during
the hospital stay and subsequent visits to our hospital, as well as blood sampling.

The second moment of inclusion, referred to as “delayed inclusion”, is possible for patients with an
acute qualifying event who were not able to provide consent during the acute event, as well as
patients

who

deferred

the

decision

to

participate

to

a

later

moment.

The

second

moment

of

inclusion is the only moment of inclusion for patients who qualify through the T2DM criterion. This
second moment of inclusion falls together with the deep phenotyping visit to one of our three
dedicated

clinical

research

units

(CRU)

that

marks

the

baseline

measurement

of

our

chronic

subcohort. This subcohort thus comprises all patients from the delayed inclusion as well as the
patient from the acute inclusion who take part in the CRU deep phenotyping program. These CRU
visits are planned at day 90 after the qualifying event with a -7/+21 range (goal 90-97) after the
initial qualifying acute event. All patients planning to participate in the CRU phenotyping program
receive extra information regarding the next steps in the study protocol, as well as the possibility to
start with the questionnaires.

Patients

who

any

inclusion

(acute

or

delayed)

re-qualify

if

they

experience

a

second

qualifying event. If the second qualifying event is of a different phenotype as the initial event, the
interval between the two qualifying events must be at least 7 days (10 days if AKI is the second
qualifying event), irrespective of whether the patient was discharged or not. If the second event is
the same as the initial qualifying event, the minimal interval is 60 days. Patients who qualify by the
T2DM criteria but decline any participation are not approached for a second time unless they are
treated in our hospital for one of the acute qualifying diseases.

Data collection
Acute phenotyping
Patients characterized by an acute event undergo a limited phenotyping procedure which includes
fasting blood sampling, medical history

and numerous self-assessed tablet based questionnaires,

including PROMIS-29 (www.healthmeasures.net) [36] and EQ-5d-3L (www.euroqol.org)[37] and a
series of disease-specific questionnaires (Table 2, Appendix 2). Paper questionnaires are available

part is prepared for storage in our biobank, include serum, heparin, CPT, citrate, EDTA. Other acute
biosampling also includes buffy coat for DNA extraction, dry blood, urine sampling in a subset of
patients.

CRU phenotyping
Following a 12-hour overnight fast, all patients are investigated at one of the three CRU sites starting
at 8.00 a.m. During this visit, a series of questionnaires is completed, focussing on demographics,
lifestyle, socioeconomic status, health history, reproductive history, food intake, and general health
status, quality of life and patient reported outcomes. Further assessments include, but are not
limited to clinical symptoms, anthropometry, metabolism, frailty and physical function, different

of their routine care interventions will also be collected. After the visit to the CRU, eligible patients
are invited for a separate visit to one of our four facilities for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and
MR-spectroscopy (MRS). MRI includes assessment of the brain to detect even small ischemic injuries
or functional changes (e.g. (sub)clinical ischemic infarcts, white matter lesions, cerebral microbleeds)
as well as cardiac MRI for the quantification of function , deformation and

structure of the heart

including quantification of fibrotic remodeling. Fat metabolism will be evaluated by abdominal fat
imaging and MRS.

Testing hemostasis: nutritional and exercise induced changes in biomarkers
One of the major research questions of the study is the relation of nutritional or exercise-induced
changes of blood based biomarkers on the development of future cardiovascular events. The idea
behind this is that inability to maintain or quickly restore homeostasis could be a strong marker of
underlying cardiovascular risk.[39] To test this, patients are randomized (stratified on study site and

Outcome ascertainment and adjudication of clinical outcomes
An extensive catalog with detailed definitions of all relevant clinical outcomes was developed. Vital
status and clinical outcomes will be assessed yearly through a systematic search of the Charité´s
electronic hospital information system. Additionally, participants will be interviewed by phone for
the occurrence of new inpatient treatments, outpatient invasive procedures, and occurrence of new
diseases. For participants not responding to calls information is requested through mail. If this fails, a

forms the basis for all later analysis involving adjudicated clinical events.

The main outcome of interest are Major Adverse Cardiac Events (MACE). MACE is a composite
outcome consisting of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or

corresponding confidence intervals where possible and appropriate instead of reporting ‘statistical
significance’, as is recommended by the STROBE guideline for the reporting of observational studies
[46]. Still, traditional power statements work under the principles of frequentist statistics. Therefore,

at 10% and correlation between covariables set at R =0.3, we will be able to detect a hazard ratio of
1.15 with 80% power and 1.17 with 90% power per standard deviation increase of a biomarker. For
binary exposures with 50% prevalence, these numbers are 1.31 and 1.37 respectively.

The acute

subcohort will have a slightly increased precision as the expected sample size is 6500. If we want to
study a smaller subset of patients, e.g. n=2400 when comparing two patients groups, the minimally
detectable effect sizes increase correspondingly, with 1.24 and 1.28 for the standardized effect and
1.54 and 1.65 for the binary exposure with 50% prevalence, respectively. Some have suggested to
completely forego on the binary concept behind hypothesis testing in both frequentist and Bayesian
tradition [47].

However, we believe that for some specific types of analyses, such as -omics analyses,

hypothesis testing is and will be at the heart of the current analyses techniques in some fields. If

Data access and -sharing
Aggregated data will be reported on our website, allowing researchers to see if the BeLOVE study
could be a relevant data source for their projects. Every researcher interested in the data of BeLOVE
may apply for data access through our use and access committee, as long as one member of the
project team is part of the BIH research community. The use and access committee evaluates the
merits and technical feasibility of the project proposal and assesses potential overlap with ongoing
projects and analyses. We support the publication of a BeLOVE dataset/analyses file as supportive
information to a BeLOVE publication.

Ethics and registration
The BeLOVE study is performed in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation of the
European Union as well as with other pertinent legislation and directives. A data protection concept
according to the data protection recommendations of the platform for technology and methods for
networked medical research (TMF; www.tmf-ev.de) has been established and is advised by the TMF
as well as the official data protection officer of the Charité. Study protocols were approved by the
Charité's Ethics Committee. The statements of the German Ethics Council on human biobanks as well
as big data and genetics research, as well as other ethically relevant directives, will be observed. He
pilot phase of BeLOVE is registered at German Clinical Trials Registry DRKS00016852. The main phase
will be registered at clinicaltrials.gov before inclusion start.

Experiences from the pilot phase
The design and organization of the BeLOVE study have been an iterative process. What is described
in this paper is the result of a pilot study, which started in 2017 and continues on up to the date of
this publication, that initially focussed on establishing (first 147 patients) and later optimizing the
logistics of the data collection. Some design elements, such as the possibility for delayed inclusion
have been added to the BeLOVE design for the main phase, which is planned to be initiated in
November 2019. Before that moment, all patients included in BeLOVE had to undergo the acute
phenotyping in order to be eligible for delayed phenotyping. The phenotyping program has also
been modified and optimized, based on patient experience, logistics, and costs, mainly in the form of

rates.

Wherever possible, we also adopted the randomization procedure for the challenge, allowing people
to participate in the meal challenge if they were allocated but unable to perform the ergometer test
and vice versa. Implementation of the recruitment procedures was different for each disease entity,
leading to a different recruitment rate and total included patients. Given the changes in the study
protocol, data collected in the pilot phase of the BeLOVE study are not incorporated in the BeLOVE
core dataset. However, for some future analyses, it might be possible to merge the core dataset and
the pilot dataset in order to increase precision. A comprehensive plan to deal with potential sources
of bias, batch effects, and missing data needs to be submitted to the use and access committee by
BeLOVE researcher who wishes to use the data of the pilot phase in their analyses. This plan should
at least describe that all results will be presented in a stratified fashion in an appendix of the main
publication.

Discussion
BeLOVE is among the first few studies to examine disease overarching risk factors and pathways in
high cardiovascular risk patients “over time”. The intensified deep phenotyping in BeLOVE will allow
to study the short and long-term fate of patients with a high cardiovascular risk. BeLOVE will thus
enable profound insight in common mechanisms underlying a whole group of diseases constituting
one of the most significant and challenging burdens for health internationally.

Our inclusion procedures embedded within BeLOVE will create two subcohorts who overlap but are
not nested in one other (see also figure 1 and figure 2). The acute subcohort has, by design, only a
limited phenotyping program,

while

the

chronic

subcohort is characterized

by

a more

detailed

phenotyping program. Even though both sub-cohorts focus on the long-term cardiovascular risk, this
detailed phenotyping program make cross sectional analyses also very interesting as they might
identify disease overarching mechanisms in specific subgroups of patients. The clinical relevance of
these mechanisms, for example in terms of improving risk prediction, can then be tested in both
sub-cohorts in which timing phenotyping links up with two distinct, and arguably equally relevant,
moments in clinical practice.

Even though the two moments of inclusion and phenotyping are chosen with the medical need in
mind, not all research questions can be answered in either cohort. Issues, such as selection through
self-selection and survival, could well lead to selection bias or at least limit the external validity of
the results. Other sources of bias, including but not limited to, immortal time bias, prevalent user
bias, and collider-stratification bias are not only possible but even likely threats to the internal
validity - as is the case in any observational clinical study. An in-depth discussion of all the possible
sources of bias is at this stage however not possible, as the relevance of these biases (direction and
magnitude) will depend on the objective of the study (i.e. effect isolation in causal questions, or
model performance in prediction and classification questions) as well as the subject matter of the
specific biological mechanisms under study.

We believe that the methodological challenges in BeLOVE are to a large extent the same as any
other clinical observational cohort. However, our two subcohorts approach shines a light on these
shortcomings as we believe that some of the methodological disadvantages from one subcohort can
mostly be counteracted by the advantages of the other subcohort. For example, the patients who
are participating in the CRU visit are a selected subgroup due to patients declining or unable to
participate

(e.g.

literature on selection bias and its quantitative adjustment[49].

Due to limited resources, we have explicitly decided to not include some additional design elements
in our study concept. Thus, BeLOVE does not include a population-based reference group which
might have served as a reference point for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality but also to study
the causes of the qualifying event using a case-control design. Given our primary aim of BeLOVE, we

have decided to focus our resources on patient inclusion, as well as strengthening the long term
follow-up procedures. Instead, we have opted for a cooperation with other cohorts for a reference
group. Hence, we have standardized our data collection to a large extent by using common data
elements (CDE) structure in order to make the comparison and combination of our data with other
cohorts possible (www.nlm.nih.gov/cde). A good candidate for this is the German National Cohort or

moment of inclusion forward in time and thus reduce the number of patients who are willing and
able to participate into the study. Of note, a delayed consent for non-interventional studies like

BeLOVE website.

We have to acknowledge the invaluable work that other cohort studies, old and current, did and do
to examine factors that predict the outcome of cardiovascular disease patients. However, most of
these studies focus on single disease entities, such as coronary heart disease or stroke. A study
somewhat similar to BeLOVE is the Second Manifestations of ARTerial disease or SMART study
[6,51]. Also using a disease overarching approach with a focus on crossover risk, this study initially
planned to include a minimum of 1000 patients but currently included almost 10.000 CVD patients
during 20 years of recruitment. In comparison to BeLOVE, SMART uses broader and more

(i.e.

comparison between the acute phase and the post-acute phase, as well as the information on
homeostasis maintenance gathered through our metabolic challenge. We believe that in BeLOVE,
the combination of the deep phenotyping approach, the approach to investigate overarching risk
factors and mechanisms across five different disease background, as well as the examination of risk
factors in the acute phase as well as in the chronic phase does make our study stand out.

Conclusion
BeLOVE provides a unique opportunity to study the short and long fate of patients with a high
cardiovascular risk through state of the art deep phenotyping. With the same extensive standardized
phenotyping procedures for all included patients that form the backbone of this study, we will be
able to study disease overarching research questions and thus better understand crossover risk, as
well as the similarities and differences between the different clinical phenotypes. Our unique design,
with an acute and a chronic arm that overlap, allows us not only to study the short and the longterm but also allows us to understand and ameliorate potential biases. However, most importantly,
the agility also provides us with the possibility to answer the research questions of the future,
improving risk prediction and thereby individualized disease management.
