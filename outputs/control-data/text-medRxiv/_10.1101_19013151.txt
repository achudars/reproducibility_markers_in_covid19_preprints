Abstract
Background: It is estimated that vaccinating 50-70% of school-aged children for

19

influenza can produce population-wide indirect effects. We evaluated a city-wide, school-

20

located influenza vaccination (SLIV) intervention that aimed to increase influenza vaccination

21

coverage. The intervention was implemented in over 95 pre-schools and elementary schools in

22

northern California from 2014 to 2018. Using a matched prospective cohort design, we

23

estimated intervention impacts on student influenza vaccination coverage, school absenteeism,

24

and community-wide indirect effects on laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations.

25

Methods and Findings: We used a multivariate matching algorithm to identify a nearby

26

comparison school district with similar pre-intervention characteristics and matched schools in

27

each district. To measure student influenza vaccination, we conducted cross-sectional surveys

28

of student caregivers in 22 school pairs (2016 survey N = 6,070; 2017 survey N = 6,507). We

29

estimated the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization from 2011-2018

30

using surveillance data from school district zip codes. We analyzed student absenteeism data

31

from 2011-2018 from each district (N = 42,487,816 student-days). To account for pre-

32

intervention differences between districts, we estimated difference-in-differences (DID) in

33

influenza hospitalization incidence and absenteeism rates using generalized linear and log-

34

linear models with a population offset for incidence outcomes.

35

The number of students vaccinated by the SLIV intervention ranged from 7,502 to

36

10,106 (22-28% of eligible students) each year. During the intervention, influenza vaccination

37

coverage among elementary students was 53-66% in the comparison district. Coverage was

38

similar between the intervention and comparison districts in 2014-15 and 2015-16 and was

significantly higher in the intervention site in 2016-17 (7% 95% CI 4, 11) and 2017-18 (11% 95%

40

CI 7, 15). During seasons when vaccination coverage was higher among intervention schools

41

and the vaccine was moderately effective, there was evidence of statistically significant indirect

42

effects: adjusting for pre-intervention differences between districts, the reduction in influenza

43

hospitalizations in the intervention site was 76 (95% CI 20, 133) in 2016-17 and 165 (95% CI 86,

44

243) in 2017-18 among non-elementary school aged individuals and 327 (5, 659) in 2016-17 and

45

715 (236, 1195) in 2017-18 among adults 65 years or older. The reduction in illness-related

46

school absences during influenza season was 3,538 (95% CI 709, 6,366) in 2016-17 and 8,249

47

(95% CI 3,213, 13,285) in 2017-18. Limitations of this study include the use of an observational

48

design, which may be subject to unmeasured confounding, and caregiver-reported vaccination

49

status, which is subject to poor recall and low response rates.

50

Conclusion: A city-wide SLIV intervention in a large, diverse urban population decreased

51

the incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization in all age groups and decreased

52

illness-specific school absence rates among students during seasons when the vaccine was

53

moderately effective, suggesting that the intervention produced indirect effects. Our findings

54

suggest that in populations with moderately high background levels of influenza vaccination

55

coverage, SLIV programs can further increase coverage and reduce influenza across

56

communities.

Introduction
Seasonal influenza contributes substantially to hospitalization and mortality, especially

59

among infants and the elderly [1]. The economic burden of influenza as a result of lost earnings

60

and medical cost was estimated to exceed $87 billion in the United States in 2007 [2]. To

61

prevent the spread of influenza, seasonal influenza vaccination of all individuals over 6 months

62

of age has been recommended by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) in

63

the U.S. since 2010 [3]. Effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines varies from year to year

64

depending on the quality of the influenza virus strain match and whether antigenic drift occurs

65

between the time when the vaccine is manufactured and the start of the seasonal influenza

66

epidemic, among other factors.

67

School aged children are responsible for the greatest proportion of community-wide

68

influenza transmission, and as a result, efforts to increase vaccination are likely to have the

69

largest impact on influenza transmission when targeted to them [4–9]. Mathematical models

70

estimate that vaccinating at least 50-70% of school-aged children against influenza can prevent

71

an influenza epidemic by producing herd immunity (i.e., “indirect effects”) [10,11]. In recent

72

years, influenza vaccination coverage in the United States has ranged from 54-62% among

73

elementary school-aged children and 37-44% among adults [12,13]. Healthy People 2020 set a

74

goal of 70% influenza vaccination coverage for children and adults [14]. Mathematical models

75

project that an increase in child influenza vaccination coverage to 80% would reduce influenza

76

hospitalizations among children by 42% and among adults by approximately 20% [15]. Herd

77

immunity is thought to play a critical role in reducing the burden of influenza morbidity and

78

mortality among older adults, for whom vaccine effectiveness is frequently lower due to

79

immunosenescence [16].

80

School-located influenza vaccination (SLIV) programs have been proposed as strategy to

81

increase influenza vaccination coverage among children [16]. Prior studies reported that SLIV

82

programs increased influenza vaccination [17–26] and decreased school absence [17–20,27–29]

83

and student illnesses [17,20], and some studies report that their economic benefits likely

84

outweigh the cost of program delivery [30,31]. There is some evidence that SLIV programs can

85

produce community-wide indirect effects among pre-school aged children and adults; however,

86

other studies have produced conflicting results [21,22,32–34]. Many prior SLIV evaluations did

87

not use randomization or multivariate matching to select a comparison group and are subject

88

to confounding [18,19,21,22,27–29,32–34]; those that have used more rigorous designs did not

89

measure health outcomes [24–26,35,36] or enrolled small numbers of schools [17,20]. No prior

90

studies have rigorously measured the impacts of large-scale SLIV interventions on student and

91

community-wide health outcomes over multiple years.

92

Here, we report the findings of a four-year evaluation of a large-scale SLIV program in

93

over 95 public, private, and charter schools in a diverse, urban, predominantly low-income city

94

in northern California. The intervention was specifically designed to cover all public, private,

95

and charter elementary schools in a geographical area in order to evaluate the potential for

96

SLIV not only to reduce influenza among elementary schoolchildren but also to interrupt

97

community-wide influenza transmission through herd effects. We expected that the SLIV

98

intervention would reduce school absenteeism and community-wide influenza hospitalizations

99

if it succeeded in increasing influenza vaccination coverage and if the seasonal influenza vaccine

100

was at least moderately effective. Using a prospective matched cohort design and three

101

independent data sources, we measured the intervention’s impact on student influenza

102

vaccination and school absences and the incidence of community-wide laboratory-confirmed

103

influenza hospitalization.

104

Methods

105

School-located influenza vaccination intervention

106

The Shoo the Flu intervention (www.shootheflu.org) delivered free influenza

107

vaccinations at schools throughout the city of Oakland, California, including all of the public and

108

charter elementary schools in Oakland Unified School District (OUSD, the “intervention

109

district”) and offered delivery to all other charter, private, and pre-schools in Oakland prior to

110

the start of influenza season from 2014 through 2018. OUSD enrolls a diverse, urban population

111

of approximately 53,000 students, including over 26,000 elementary school students (grades K

112

through 5). Over 70% of students in this district are from low-income households, and half of

113

students speak a language other than English in their home. The intervention aimed to increase

114

influenza vaccination coverage among primarily elementary school-aged children in order to

115

reduce influenza among elementary schoolchildren and to produce indirect effects protecting

116

other age groups in the community. In its first two years, the intervention deployed a mass

117

media campaign in the Oakland area, including advertisements in the subway, bus shelters,

118

billboards, and newspapers, as well as through digital media. The intervention did not carry out

119

promotion efforts outside of the Oakland area, although it is possible that residents of areas

120

near Oakland were exposed to Shoo the Flu media. Caregivers of the students provided written

121

consent for vaccination, and this consent process was separate from consent to participate in

122

the evaluation of the intervention. Children were eligible for vaccination regardless of their

123

insurance status. From 2014-2018, between 95 and 138 elementary and pre-schools

124

participated in Shoo the Flu, and each year the intervention vaccinated between 7,502 and

125

10,106 students (22-28% of eligible students) (S1 Appendix).

126

Influenza vaccine effectiveness during the intervention

127

In 2014-15 and 2015-16, the intervention offered the live attenuated influenza vaccine

128

(LAIV) to students and the inactivated injectable influenza vaccine (IIV) to students with LAIV

129

contraindications, consistent with ACIP recommendations [37,38]. The intervention also offered

130

the IIV to school staff and teachers. In early 2016 the ACIP changed its recommendation for

131

children aged 2 to 8 years from LAIV to IIV due to concerns about the low effectiveness of LAIV

132

in the two prior seasons [39]. In 2016-17 and 2017-18 the intervention offered only the IIV. The

133

seasonal influenza vaccine delivered by the intervention had low effectiveness in 2014-15 and

134

2015-16 and moderate effectiveness in 2016-17 and 2017-18 (S2 Appendix) [40,41].

135

Study design

136

The SLIV intervention was offered to all pre-schools and elementary schools in the city

137

of Oakland with the goal of delivering SLIV to the largest number of schools possible in order to

138

interrupt influenza transmission (i.e., produce indirect effects) in the city. For this reason, it was

139

infeasible to use a cluster-randomized design because all schools in the district were offered

140

the intervention. The study used a prospective matched cohort design to evaluate the SLIV

141

intervention program [42]. We drew on multiple independent data sources to assess a full

142

range of outcomes that could have been affected by the SLIV intervention: 1) influenza

143

vaccination coverage, 2) influenza hospitalizations in the community, and 3) all-cause and

144

illness-specific school absence rates among elementary school students. We conducted a

145

survey of a sample of student caregivers to measure influenza vaccination coverage and

146

analyzed existing school absence and influenza hospitalization records. In some cases, outcome

147

assessment implied slightly different designs and estimators, as we describe below.

148

The matched design focused on the vaccination coverage survey. We first selected from

149

comparison school districts among San Francisco Bay Area districts that had at least four

150

elementary schools and had pre-intervention school-level characteristics similar to the

151

intervention district. We restricted possible comparison districts to those with boundaries

152

separated by at least five miles from the intervention district to minimize contamination.

153

Though the intervention was provided to some private and charter schools, the study

154

population was restricted to public elementary schools in the intervention city school district

155

because pre-intervention data were not readily available to identify suitable comparison private

156

or non-district charter schools.

157

We used a genetic multivariate matching algorithm [43] to pair-match schools in the

158

intervention district with schools in each candidate comparison district. The matching algorithm

159

used the following pre-intervention school-level characteristics: mean enrollment, class size,

160

parental education, academic performance index scores, California standardized test scores,

161

and the school-level percentage of English language learners and students receiving free lunch

162

at school. We excluded pre-schools from this evaluation because the availability of pre-schools

163

and enrollment criteria varied from school district to school district, complicating comparisons

164

between districts. We identified West Contra Costa Unified School District (WCCUSD) as the

165

best nearby comparison district because, on average, it had the smallest generalized

166

Mahalanobis distance between paired schools [43] and a sufficient number of elementary

167

schools (N=34 schools, grades K through 6) in the district to ensure adequate statistical power.

168

The absolute value of the standardized difference was under 50 for most variables, indicating

169

that the matching produced good quality school pair matches [44] (see S3 Appendix for further

170

details).

171

Analyses of influenza hospitalization and school absences leveraged the matched design

172

but used a slightly different approach tailored to each outcome. Because the intention was to

173

measure community-wide indirect effects of SLIV on influenza hospitalization, we included

174

hospitalizations of all residents of zip codes within the intervention and comparison district

175

school catchment areas, including zip codes that were partially within the district boundary. To

176

measure impacts on school absences we pre-specified inclusion of all public elementary schools

177

enrolling Kindergarten to grade 5 (“K-5”) (50 intervention schools, 34 comparison schools)

178

rather than the matched subset used to design the vaccine coverage survey in order to

179

maximize precision.

180

Outcomes and data sources

181

Vaccine coverage survey

182

We conducted two cross-sectional surveys of student caregivers to measure caregiver-

183

reported student influenza vaccination, including vaccine type and vaccine provider. A survey in

184

March 2017 measured vaccination from 2014-17, and a survey in March 2018 measured

185

vaccination from 2017-18. We conducted the surveys in 22 of the 34 matched school pairs (22

186

K-5 schools in the intervention district and 22 K-6 schools in the comparison district). In all

187

classrooms in each school, teachers distributed anonymous paper surveys to students to share

188

with their caregivers. The survey was conducted independently from the intervention and

189

allowed caregivers to report student influenza vaccination at any location. To estimate the

190

required sample size for the survey, we assumed a realistic response rate of 50 surveys per

191

school (approximately 16% of students), type I error = 0.05, intraclass correlation coefficient =

192

0.01, and 70% vaccine coverage in the comparison district. Enrolling 22 school pairs (44 schools

193

total) allowed us to detect a minimum difference in vaccination coverage between districts of

194

6.5% with 80% statistical power.

195

Laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization

196

We obtained counts of all laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations, intensive

197

care unit admissions, and deaths among hospitalized patients and the duration of influenza

198

hospitalization from zip codes within with the intervention and comparison school districts

199

from 2011-2018 from the CDC-sponsored California Emerging Infections Program [45].

200

School absence records

201

We obtained records of absentee data for each student on each school day from 2011-

202

2018 from all public elementary schools in each school district. Absences were classified by

203

student grade, race/ethnicity, and absence type (all-cause absences versus illness-specific

204

absences).

205

Statistical analysis

206

Unless otherwise specified, analyses were conducted in R version 3.6.1 [46]. Our pre-

207

analysis plan, selected datasets, and replication scripts are available through the Open Science

208

Framework (https://osf.io/c8xuq/). We defined total effects as the difference in outcomes

209

between elementary school-aged individuals (both those who did and did not participate in the

10

210

intervention) in the intervention versus comparison site and indirect effects as the difference in

211

outcomes between non-elementary school-aged individuals (individuals < 4 years, ³13 years) in

212

the intervention versus comparison site (Fig 1; for additional details on types of effects

213

estimated, see S4 Appendix).

214

Definitions of influenza season

215

Because influenza season timing varies from year to year, we pre-specified a data-

216

derived definition of influenza season in order to conduct our analysis during the weeks in

217

which the influenza epidemic occurred locally each year. Under this definition, influenza season

218

started when there were at least two consecutive weeks in which the percentage of medical

219

visits for influenza-like illness in California as reported by the California Department of Public

220

Health [47] exceeded a cutoff, and the season ended when there were at least two consecutive

221

weeks in which the percentage was less than or equal to a cutoff. We examined seasons

222

defined using cutoffs of 2%, 2.5%, and 3% and selected 2.5% as the primary definition because

223

it best captured seasonal variation in peak influenza-like illness (S5 Appendix). In addition, in a

224

sensitivity analysis we used the California Emerging Infection Program’s surveillance definition

225

of influenza season, which classifies influenza season as the weeks between October 1 and April

226

30 each year. This definition is widely used but is conservative in that it often includes many

227

weeks of the year with limited influenza-like illness in influenza season.

228

Influenza vaccination coverage

229

We estimated influenza vaccination coverage and 95% confidence intervals using robust

230

sandwich standard errors that accounted for clustering at the school level [48]. We estimated

231

differences in vaccination coverage between districts using a generalized linear model that

11

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19013151; this version posted December 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

232

adjusted for student race/ethnicity and caregiver’s education level and estimated standard

233

errors that accounted for clustering within matched school pairs. We restricted the analysis to

234

grades K-5 because the intervention district’s elementary schools did not include 6th grade. To

235

assess possible selection bias among the sample of caregivers who responded to the survey, we

236

also estimated vaccination coverage after standardizing the distributions of race/ethnicity and

237

education in the sample to the pre-intervention percentages using data from the California

238

Department of Education for the 44 participating schools and for the entire districts (see details

239

in S6 Appendix).

240

Laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization

241

To estimate the cumulative incidence of influenza hospitalization, we obtained age- and

242

race-specific population counts from the 2010 U.S. Census in the same set of zip codes used to

243

identify influenza cases. We also obtained more recent annual population counts from the 5-

244

year American Community Survey (ACS). Because counts were similar between both data

245

sources and the ACS did not provide population counts for race and age in years, we used the

246

U.S. Census data in our primary analyses. We fit log-linear Poisson models to estimate

247

cumulative incidence using a log population offset and adjusting for age, sex, and race [49]. To

248

control for pre-season differences between districts, we estimated the difference-in-differences

249

(DID) defined as the difference in incidence in the intervention district prior to and during the

250

intervention minus the difference in incidence in the comparison district prior to and during the

251

intervention. Examination of pre-intervention absence trends indicated that the equal trends

252

assumption was met (S7 Appendix). The DID parameter eliminates any time-invariant

253

confounding and accounts for differences in pre-intervention trends between districts [50]. We

254

also estimated the relative reduction adjusting for pre-intervention differences between

255

districts, which we defined as 1 – RR x 100%, where RR is defined as the difference in incidence

256

in the intervention district prior to and during the intervention divided by the difference in

257

incidence in the comparison district prior to and during the intervention. We obtained standard

258

errors for each quantity using the delta method. Consistent with our pre-analysis plan, we did

259

not estimate DIDs for intensive care unit admission on its own or for influenza mortality

260

because these are rare outcomes, and we were likely to be underpowered to detect an effect.

261

We performed a sensitivity analysis using the following alternative influenza season cutoffs: 1)

262

two consecutive weeks in which the percentage of medical visits for influenza-like illness

263

exceeded 2% or 3% and 2) the period between week 40 and week 20 of each year.

264

School absence rates

265

We restricted the primary analysis of school absence rates to school days when both

266

districts were in session. In addition, we restricted to school days that occurred during influenza

267

season because we did not expect the intervention to influence influenza and absenteeism

268

outside of that period. We also estimated outcomes in the peak week of influenza season,

269

defined as the week with the highest proportion of influenza-like illness visits in California when

270

school was in session. We estimated DIDs in mean absence rates using linear regression models

271

and adjusted for available time-variant covariates: student race, grade, and month of absence.

272

We did not adjust for pre-intervention school characteristics (i.e., those used in the matching of

273

school pairs) because they were time-invariant and thus would have no effect on DID estimates.

274

276

influenza season by multiplying DID estimates and confidence interval bounds by the total

277

student enrollment and the number of school days in each influenza season.

278

To detect potential differential measurement error of school absences, we conducted a

279

negative control analysis [51] using the school days in August, September, May, and June; these

280

months were prior to the delivery of vaccines at school and outside of influenza season, when

281

we did not expect to see an effect of the intervention [14]. We also performed a sensitivity

282

analysis using the following alternative influenza season cutoffs: 1) two consecutive weeks in

283

which the percentage of medical visits for influenza-like illness exceeded 2% or 3% and 2) the

284

period between week 40 and week 20 of each year. We performed pre-specified subgroup

285

analyses by student race, grade, and month.

286

As we describe in the Results, the negative control analysis indicated possible

287

differential measurement error of school absences, so we performed a post-hoc probabilistic

288

bias analysis to quantify the possible influence of outcome misclassification on our results [52].

289

We focused on outcome misclassification because exposure misclassification was highly

290

unlikely, and our DID analysis accounted for measured and time-invariant unmeasured

291

confounders. Through conversations with each school district, we defined distributions of the

292

sensitivity and specificity of absence classification (S8 Appendix).

293

To examine impact across different levels of program participation among the 50 SLIV

294

intervention schools, we predicted the mean absence rates (Y) setting each school’s value to

Ethical statement
This study was approved by the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the

307
308

University of California, Berkeley (Protocols # 2014-01-5960 and 2016-12-9406). Caregivers of

309

students in the influenza vaccine coverage survey received a letter from the school district

310

describing the purpose of the survey and providing details about the optional and anonymous

311

nature of the survey. A waiver of documented informed consent was necessary to carry out the

312

survey because in two years of pilot surveys in which we requested documented informed

313

consent, the complexity of consent forms contributed to very low response rates that

314

prevented us from collecting a sufficiently large sample to estimate vaccination coverage.

Influenza vaccine coverage

Measured pre-intervention characteristics were similar in populations residing in the

318

WCCUSD (S9 Appendix). The response rates were 28% (N=2,246 surveys) in OUSD and 38% in

321

WCCUSD (N=3,824). One school in OUSD withdrew, and we excluded its matched pair from

322

analyses comparing the two districts. In March 2018, the same schools were invited to

323

participate, and the response rates were similar. In each survey, 34-40% of respondents had a

324

higher than high school level education, approximately 22-27% of respondents’ primarily

325

language spoken at home was Spanish. The most common student race/ethnicity was Latino

326

(36-41% in intervention; 50-51% in comparison), followed by Asian (22-25% in intervention; 16-

327

17% in comparison) and Black / African American (16% in intervention; 10% in comparison).

328

Influenza vaccination coverage (from any location) among K-5 elementary students did

329

not differ statistically between the intervention and comparison districts in the first two years

330

of the SLIV intervention but was higher in the intervention district in the latter two years of the

331

intervention. In relation to the comparison district, influenza vaccination coverage in the

332

intervention district was 7% higher in 2016-17 and 11% higher in 2017-18; differences were

333

statistically significant (Table 2). Standardizing vaccination coverage by student race and parent

334

education produced similar results (S10 Appendix Fig 1). The percentage of elementary

335

students vaccinated for influenza at school was 14% in 2014-15, 23% in 2015-16, 24% in 2016-

336

17, and 26% in 2017-18 (S10 Appendix Fig 2). The majority of students not vaccinated at school

337

were vaccinated at a doctor’s office or health clinic.

338

Influenza vaccination coverage varied by student race (S10 Appendix Fig 3). In 2016-17

339

and 2017-18, the highest coverage levels were among Asian and White students and the lowest

340

were among Black / African American students and those whose race was not reported. Over

341

the four years when the program was delivered, there were statistically significant increases in

342

influenza vaccination coverage in the intervention district relative to the comparison district

343

among Black / African American, Asian, Latino, and White students. The differences in coverage

344

between districts was most striking among Latino students (12% higher in OUSD in 2016-17;

345

14% higher in 2017-18) and White students (10% higher in OUSD in 2016-17; 24% higher in

346

2017-18). The difference in student influenza vaccination coverage between districts was

347

largest among students whose primary caregiver had a high school level education or less (S10

348

Appendix, Fig 4). When adjusting for school-level characteristics, influenza vaccination coverage

349

did not vary by the percentage of students participating in SLIV in each school (S10 Appendix,

350

Fig 5).

351

Influenza hospitalization

352

In the three years before the intervention, the incidence of influenza-related

353

hospitalization was similar between the intervention and comparison districts (Fig 2). In 2014-

354

15 and 2015-16, the incidence of influenza hospitalization was not statistically different

355

between the intervention and comparison districts in any age group (Fig 3, S10 Appendix Table

356

1). In 2016-17 and 2017-18, hospitalization incidence was lower in the intervention versus

357

comparison district in all age groups. Among non-elementary aged individuals (0-4, >14 years),

358

the DID in total influenza hospitalization was -76 (95% CI -133, -20) in 2016-17 and -165 (95% CI

359

-243, -86) in 2017-18 (Fig 3, S10 Appendix Table 1) in the intervention versus comparison

360

district. Among individuals aged at least 65 years, the DID in total influenza hospitalization was

361

-327 (95% CI -659, -5) in 2016-17 and -715 (95% CI -1,195, -236) in 2017-18 (Fig 3, S10 Appendix

362

Table 1). Results were similar in analyses restricted to the peak week of influenza

363

hospitalization (S10 Appendix Fig 6). When stratifying by patient race/ethnicity, in 2016-17 and

364

2017-18 DIDs were the largest among Asian / Pacific Islanders and Whites (S10 Appendix Fig 7).

365

Among all ages and across all four years, the mean DID in length of influenza

366

hospitalization was approximately 1 to 2.5 days lower in the intervention district versus the

367

comparison district (S10 Appendix Figs 8-9). The incidence of influenza-related intensive care

368

unit admissions was lower in the intervention site than in the comparison site in 2014-17 and

369

was similar in 2017-18 (S10 Appendix, Fig 10). The influenza-related mortality rate was slightly

370

higher in the intervention site before the intervention and was lower in 2014-15, 2015-16, and

371

2017-18 influenza seasons (S10 Appendix, Fig 11). However, for all intensive care unit and

372

mortality estimates, 95% confidence intervals for district-specific estimates overlapped. Our

373

sensitivity analyses using alternative population denominators, influenza case definitions, and

374

influenza season definitions yielded similar results overall (S11 Supplement, Figs 12-13).

375

School absenteeism

376

In the three years prior to the Shoo the Flu program, during influenza season, the mean

377

absence rate per 100 days in the intervention versus comparison district was 4.85 versus 5.84

378

for all-cause absences and 2.84 versus 2.81 for illness-specific absences (S10 Appendix Table 2).

379

The DID in mean illness-specific absence rates per 100 days was -0.16 (95% CI -0.54, 0.23) in

380

2014-15 and -0.34 (95% CI -0.78, 0.10) in 2015-16 (Fig 4, S10 Appendix Table 2). In 2016-17 and

381

2017-18 the DID in illness-specific absence rates per 100 days was lower in the Intervention

382

district compared to the comparison district (2016-17 DID -0.63 (95% CI -1.14, -0.13); 2017-18

383

DID -0.80 (95% CI -1.28, -0.31)). The reduction in total illness-specific student absences during

384

influenza season was 3,538 (95% CI 709, 6,366) in 2016-17 and 8,249 (95% CI 3,213, 13,285) in

385

2017-18 in the intervention district. For all-cause absences, the DIDs during influenza season

386

were not statistically significant in any of the years of the program. During the peak week of

387

influenza, there was evidence of larger reductions in illness-specific absence rates in 2014-15,

388

2016-17, and 2017-18, and there was a significant reduction in all-cause absences in 2017-18

389

(S10 Appendix Table 2). Our sensitivity analyses using alternative influenza season definitions

390

were consistent with the primary analysis (S10 Appendix Fig 14).

391
392
When stratifying by student race/ethnicity, there were statistically significant reductions

393
394

in all-cause and illness-specific absences among Latino students in 2016-17 and 2017-18 and a

395

smaller reduction in absences for Asian students in 2016-17 (S10 Appendix, Fig 15). For

396

students of other race/ethnicities, DIDs were not statistically significant. Grade-specific patterns

397

were similar overall (S10 Appendix, Fig 16). Mean absence rates were not associated with the

398

percentage of students in each school that participated in Shoo the Flu in 2014-15 and 2015-16.

399

In 2017-18 the school-level SLIV participation rate was associated with a modest reduction in

400

the mean absence rate when adjusting for potential school-level confounders (S10 Appendix Fig

401

17).

402

We performed a negative control time period analysis, estimating DIDs outside influenza

403

season, when we did not expect the intervention to affect absence rates. Overall, we did not

404

see an effect on all-cause absences outside of influenza season. However, there were

405

statistically significant reductions in illness-specific absences outside of influenza season in

406

2015-18 (S10 Appendix, Fig 18), suggesting that differential measurement error may have

407

impacted the primary analysis. We explored the influence of outcome misclassification on our

408

findings with probabilistic bias analysis under assumed distributions of sensitivity and specificity

409

of outcome classification. We found that the majority of bias-corrected DID estimates in 2016-

410

17 and 2017-18 indicated a reduction in both types of absences in the intervention district (S8

411

Appendix Figs 2-3). These findings suggest that outcome misclassification was not strong

412

enough to alter the scientific inferences in our primary analysis of absenteeism.

413

Discussion

414

Here, we evaluated the impact of a city-wide SLIV intervention delivered to over 95

415

elementary schools in a diverse, predominantly low-income city. During the first two years of

416

SLIV, the program offered LAIV, which had low effectiveness [58,59], and on the whole, we did

417

not observe impacts of SLIV in those years. In the latter two years, when the intervention

418

delivered the IIV and the vaccine was moderately effective [41,60], we observed reductions in

419

school absences and reductions in hospitalizations among age groups not targeted by SLIV,

420

suggesting that the intervention produced herd effects. Unique strengths of our study design

421

include the use of multivariate matching and a differences-in-differences approach to minimize

422

systematic differences between the intervention and comparison sites and the pre-specification

423

of our statistical analysis plan [61]. Evaluating SLIV over multiple years enabled us to examine

424

the impact of SLIV in influenza seasons with different levels of vaccine effectiveness, vaccine

425

recommendations, and circulating strains of influenza. Furthermore, this study leveraged three

426

distinct, independent data sources that provided internally consistent results.

427
428

The SLIV intervention was associated with increases in influenza vaccination coverage of
up to 11 percentage points among elementary school students in the intervention site versus

20

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19013151; this version posted December 4, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

429

the comparison site. This increase in vaccination coverage is smaller than those reported in

430

prior SLIV studies, which ranged from 7 to 41 percentage points. However, in most prior

431

studies, coverage at baseline or in the comparison group was substantially lower than 50%

432

[17,18,20,22,24–26,34], while in our study it was 53-66%. It may be more difficult for SLIV to

433

substantially increase coverage at moderate pre-intervention coverage levels. In addition, the

434

switch from LAIV to IIV in the third year of the Shoo the Flu intervention may have inhibited

435

larger increases in coverage because many children and/or caregivers prefer the nasal spray

436

generally and in a school setting, and media coverage of poor LAIV effectiveness may have

437

increased vaccine hesitancy for all influenza vaccine formulations. Vaccination coverage in the

438

intervention district grew relative to the comparison district over time, in part because the

439

comparison district coverage did not recover from the decline associated with the switch from

440

LAIV to IIV vaccines. It is possible that coverage in the intervention district vaccine coverage will

441

continue to grow in future years as the intervention builds trust and recognition.

442

A key question is whether SLIV interventions increase vaccination coverage among

443

students who would otherwise not be vaccinated, whether they merely shift vaccination

444

location from health care providers to schools, or whether both occur. Interventions that

445

vaccinate children who would otherwise not have been vaccinated will have the largest impact

446

on influenza transmission. Our findings suggest that both phenomena occurred in this study.

447

Coverage was higher in the intervention versus comparison district in the final two years of the

448

evaluation, suggesting that some otherwise unvaccinated children were vaccinated by the SLIV

449

intervention. In addition, the proportion of students vaccinated at school in the intervention

450

district (24-26% in the latter two years (S10 Appendix, Fig 2)) exceeded the difference in

21

451

coverage between districts (7-11%), suggesting that approximately 15% of students vaccinated

452

by the SLIV intervention would otherwise have been vaccinated through other means. A

453

limitation is that pre-intervention vaccination data were not available, so we were not able to

454

conduct DID analyses to account for any pre-SLIV differences in vaccination coverage between

455

districts.

456

Influenza vaccination coverage in the Shoo the Flu intervention site was 64%, which was

457

up to 11% higher than in the comparison site and well within the 50-70% range in which herd

458

immunity is expected [10,11]. We observed 36-60% relative reductions in influenza

459

hospitalization among non-elementary school aged community-members in seasons with

460

moderate vaccine effectiveness (S10 Appendix Table 1). Indirect effects were strongest among

461

individuals aged 65 years or older – the age group most vulnerable to influenza hospitalization

462

and mortality. The magnitude of indirect effects we observed is similar to those of other SLIV

463

interventions [21,22,32–34] and of interventions vaccinating children at any location [62]. In

464

addition, our results are highly consistent with mathematical models, which project that an

465

increase from 40 to 60% coverage in children aged 6 months to 18 years would reduce

466

influenza hospitalization among adults over 19 years by 33-36% [15]. Our findings suggest that

467

even modest increases in vaccination (i.e., up to 11%) associated with SLIV can produce

468

meaningful community-wide reductions in influenza hospitalization, consistent with

469

mathematical models [63].

470

We observed greater increases in influenza vaccination coverage in the intervention site

471

versus the comparison site in students whose caregivers had up to a high school-level

472

education compared to those with at least an associate degree. No prior SLIV evaluations have

473

reported variation in the impact of SLIV on vaccination coverage by caregiver education level.

474

Our findings contrast with those of prior studies of influenza vaccination outside school

475

settings, which have generally found that higher education levels are associated with higher

476

vaccination rates [64–66]. A limitation of this work is that education level was not available at

477

the individual level for the influenza hospitalization and absenteeism outcomes.

478

Shoo the Flu’s impacts on influenza vaccination coverage, school absence rates, and

479

influenza hospitalization varied by race/ethnicity. Black / African American students had the

480

lowest influenza vaccination coverage, consistent with national CDC estimates [12], and a

481

smaller increase in coverage in the SLIV district compared to most other races. This pattern in

482

vaccination coverage may explain the more modest impacts on absenteeism and hospitalization

483

among Black / African Americans compared to Whites and Asians. For Latino / Hispanic

484

students, vaccination coverage was lower, but the increase in coverage in the intervention site

485

was larger over time compared to White students. There was a larger reduction in absenteeism

486

but a smaller reduction in hospitalizations in Latino / Hispanics compared to Whites and Asians.

487

Disparities in influenza vaccination coverage may result from barriers to health care, differing

488

knowledge and attitudes about vaccines, unconscious bias on behalf of providers promoting

489

vaccination, underinsurance, or other social determinants of health [67]. Latino / Hispanics

490

more commonly cite limited health care access and cost as barriers while Black / African

491

Americans report mistrust in influenza vaccination [68]. In principle, SLIV should reduce

492

disparities by race / ethnicity by increasing access to free influenza vaccination regardless of

493

insurance status. However, increasing access alone does not address mistrust or vaccine

494

hesitancy; to reduce disparities in vaccination, future interventions may need to couple SLIV

495

with outreach strategies to address vaccine hesitancy, mistrust, and misconceptions about the

496

influenza vaccine in particular [69]; incentives for vaccination; or policies mandating

497

vaccination.

498

This analysis is subject to several limitations. First, although the reductions in illness-

499

specific school absences we observed were of a similar magnitude to those reported in prior

500

studies [17–20,27–29], our finding of significant differences in absence rates outside of

501

influenza season suggests that our absentee results may be subject to differential

502

misclassification. It is possible that school year- and school district-specific differences

503

unrelated to the SLIV intervention could explain these findings. For example, district-specific

504

policies to decrease absences around school breaks (some of which coincide with influenza

505

season) or at the beginning or the end of the school year (which is included in our negative

506

control time period analysis) may have impacted our estimates in an unknown direction,

507

especially if they differed before and during the SLIV intervention. In addition, parents may

508

have attributed illness absences to a different reason, and such misclassification could have

509

varied by district. Our probabilistic bias correction analysis suggested that correcting for

510

misclassification would not have changed our conclusion that the SLIV intervention reduced

511

illness-specific absences in 2016-17 and 2017-18.

512

Second, given that the SLIV intervention was delivered city-wide, it was not possible to

513

conduct a randomized trial. The matched cohort design minimized differences in measured

514

confounders between the intervention and comparison site, and DID analyses controlled for

515

measured and unmeasured time-invariant confounding. Nevertheless, unmeasured time-

516

dependent confounding could still bias this observational design. For example, the first year of

24

517

the SLIV intervention coincided with the rollout of the preventive benefits of the Affordable

518

Care Act, which may have jointly affected health care utilization and vaccination patterns in the

519

study region.

520

Third, our vaccination coverage estimates relied on caregiver reporting, which is subject

521

to inaccurate recall and low response rates. Prior studies report that caregiver recall of child

522

influenza vaccination in the past season has a sensitivity of 88-92% and a specificity of 82-90%

523

compared to medical records [70–72]. Coverage estimates for 2014-15 and 2015-16 may be

524

more vulnerable to measurement error because they rely on a 2-3 year recall period. Overall,

525

our vaccination coverage estimates were consistent with caregiver-reported national and

526

California-specific estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [12,73].

527

Finally, we did not have a direct measure of laboratory-confirmed influenza incidence in

528

elementary school children or influenza vaccination coverage estimates among non-elementary

529

aged individuals; thus, it remains possible that factors other than the SLIV intervention could

530

explain our findings. We were not able to link individuals between different data sources

531

because personal identifiers were not available to us. Nevertheless, high levels of internal

532

consistency across results from three independent data sources lends credence to the validity

533

of our findings.

534

Conclusions

535

Offering school-located influenza vaccination to all elementary schools in a large, urban

536

district led to 7-11% increases in vaccination, which translated to meaningful reductions in

537

community-wide reductions in influenza hospitalization and illness-specific absences among

538

school children among those not targeted by the program, including the elderly. Our findings

suggest that even modest increases in influenza vaccination above moderate coverage levels

540

can produce broad community-wide benefits.

Weekly incidence proportion of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalizations between Week 40-52 and Week 1-20 of each year. Hospitalizations
included school district residents tested at health care facility laboratories located in zip codes overlapping with OUSD and WCCUSD (Alameda County
Public Health Department, Children’s Hospital Oakland, Contra Costa Public Health Department, Kaiser Permanente, Sutter Health). Population
denominators were obtained from the U.S. 2010 Census using the same set of zip codes.

Season
Cumulative incidence of laboratory-confirmed influenza hospitalization and intensive care unit admission
during influenza season. Difference-in-difference estimates represent the difference between intervention
and control groups in their change in incidence from the three pre-program years (2011-2013) to each
program year, which removes any time-invariant differences between groups (measured or unmeasured).
The left y-axis presents the difference-in-difference in the cumulative incidence per 100,000. The right y-axis
presents the difference-in-difference in the total hospitalizations, which was calculated as the product of the
difference-in-difference in the cumulative incidence and the population of the intervention site. Parameters
were estimated using a log-linear Poisson model with an offset for population size, and were further adjusted
for age, race, and sex. Standard errors and 95% confidence intervals were obtained using the delta method.

Program year

In Panel A, each difference-in-difference estimate compares the difference in mean absence rates in each
district in a program year compared to the three pre-program years (2011-2013); in Panel B, each differencein-difference estimate compares the difference in total absence rates, which was calculated by multiplying
difference-in-difference in mean absences by the total enrollment and total number of school days during
influenza season each season. Difference-in-difference parameters remove any time-invariant differences
between groups (measured or unmeasured). Parameters were estimated using a generalized linear model
and were adjusted for month, student race, and grade. Standard errors and 95% confidence intervals account
for clustering at the school level. Note: in 2011-12, 2016-17, and 2017-18, the peak week of the percentage
of influenza-like illness visits in California were the last week of December, which coincided with school
breaks, so for the absentee analysis we shifted the peak week definition to closest week with the next
highest percentage of influenza-like illness visits when both school districts were in session.
