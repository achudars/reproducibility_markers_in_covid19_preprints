Abstract
Gliomas are the most common primary brain cancers. In recent years, IDH mutation and
1p/19q codeletion have been suggested as biomarkers for the diagnosis, treatment and
prognosis of gliomas. However, these biomarkers are only effective for a part of glioma
patients and thus more biomarkers are still emergently needed. Recently, an electrochemical
communication between normal neurons and glioma cells by neuro-glioma synapse has been
reported. Moreover, it was discovered that breast-to-brain metastasis tumor cells have pseudo
synapses with neurons and these synapses were indicated to promote tumor progression and
metastasis. Based on the above observations, we first curated a panel of 66 SA genes and then
proposed a metric, SA score, to quantify the synapseness for each sample of 12 glioma gene
expression datasets from TCGA, CGGA, and GEO. Strikingly, SA score showed excellent
predictive ability for the prognosis, diagnosis, and grading of gliomas. Moreover, being
compared with the two established biomarkers, IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion, SA
score was demonstrated independent and better predictive performance. In conclusion, this
study revealed that SA genes contribute to glioma formation and development, and proposed
a quantitative method, SA score, as an efficient biomarker for monitoring gliomas.

Introduction
Brain and other nervous system cancers are estimated to take up 1.4% of new cancers
but 2.9% of cancer deaths in 20191. Gliomas are the most frequent cancers of these cancers,
including

astrocytoma

(including

glioblastoma),

oligodendroglioma,

ependymoma,

oligoastrocytoma (mixed glioma), malignant glioma, not otherwise specified (NOS), and a

few rare histologies2. World Health Organization (WHO) classified gliomas into grades I to IV,
and introduced biomarkers of IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion in 2016 edition3,4.
Glioblastoma (WHO grade IV) accounts for about half of gliomas, with a median survival of
less than two years2,5. Gliomas with lower grade have a diverse prognosis, either progressing
to be as poor as glioblastoma or living more than 10 years after effective treatment6.
Over the years, with the fast improvement of omics and big data technology, RNA
sequencing has been developing towards lower cost and higher throughput, producing a large
amount of biological and medical data, which provides great convenience for life science
research7,8. Impelled by advantage of big data analysis, numerous biomarkers have been
found in the diagnosis and prognosis of gliomas9,10. In addition, single-cell sequencing
showed more detailed landscapes of gliomas11-13. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
provides a facility to extract effective information from a large number of RNA expression
data14. Moreover, single sample GSEA (ssGSEA) can calculate without group information
and give every sample an enrichment score

. The Biomarkers such as IDH mutation and

1p/19q codeletion provided helps for monitoring the development and prognosis of gliomas
but are only effective for a part of patients16. Therefore, given the enormous severity of
gliomas, more biomarkers are emergently needed.
It is recently reported that neuron and glioma have electrochemical communication
through AMPA receptor-dependent synapses between presynaptic neurons and postsynaptic
glioma cells17,18. These observations suggest that the neural synaptic electrochemical
connections promote glioma progression. Simultaneously, an appearance of glutamatergic
‘pseudo-tripartite’ synapses between breast-to-brain metastasis tumor cells and neurons was

observed19. Based on these anatomical and cytological findings, we hypothesized that the
synapse assembly (SA) genes can be used as a biomarker for glioma prognosis. To confirm
this hypothesis, here we first curated a list of genes involved in SA and then performed
ssGSEA analysis for glioma gene expression datasets from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA),
the Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA), and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO).
Interestingly, the tumor synapses may be involved in immune escape and multiple molecular
pathways. Strikingly, SA was found to be an independent and effective biomarker for gliomas.

Results
The panel of synapse assembly genes serves as a novel biomarker for gliomas. In order to
investigate whether SA can be biomarker for glioma patients, we first curated a list of SA
genes. As a result, 66 genes were collected (Supplementary File 1). Then we performed
ssGSEA to TCGA and CGGA datasets for survival analysis. The results showed glioma
patients with higher SA scores have longer overall survival time (Fig 1). Cox regression
analysis also shows the same results (Table 1). Moreover, patients with higher WHO grade
have significantly lower SA scores (Fig. 2), which agrees with the survival analysis. In
addition, it is deserved to be mentioned that SA score shows an ability to distinguish between
glioma and normal brain tissue, which reveals a potential diagnostic application of SA (Fig.
2e-g, Supplementary Fig. 1; AUCs of ROC analysis for GSE4290, GSE16011, and
GSE50161 datasets are 0.91, 0.99, and 0.93, respectively).

Comparison of SA score with established biomarkers. IDH mutation and 1p/19q
codeletion are two established biomarkers for gliomas. Both biomarkers provided great helps
for monitoring glioma development but both are effective on only a part of patients. Therefore,
it is interesting to explore whether SA score is an independent biomarker and whether SA
score is better than the established biomarkers or not. For doing so, we first analyzed the
relationship of SA scores with IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion status. We found that
IDH-mut gliomas were associated with significantly higher SA scores than IDH-wt ones (Fig.
3a-d). And 1p/19q codeletion gliomas represent a higher SA scores than non-codeletion ones
(Fig. 3e-h). Moreover, after moving the effects of the two established biomarkers using
multivariate Cox regression model, we revealed that SA score is an independent biomarker
for predicting prolonged overall survival in gliomas (Table 1). In addition, the grading ability

of SA score is also independent to IDH mutation and 1p/19q codeletion (Supplementary Fig.

Discussion
Given the recently revealed roles of neuro-glioma synapse in glioma development, here
we curated a panel of 66 synapse assembly (SA) genes and proposed the SA score as a
biomarker for the prognosis, grading, and diagnosis of gliomas. The SA score was validated
by over 3000 samples of 12 datasets from TCGA, CGGA, and GEO.
To confirm whether the SA score does represent the process of synapse assembly or not,
we performed Spearman’s correlation analysis between SA score and expressions of synapse
receptor genes

17

(Supplementary Fig. 3a). The result showed that a number of genes,

especially AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid) receptor genes
(not contain in SA genes), which were focused in recent studies17,18, have a positive
correlation with SA scores. Then, we applied pathway analysis to genes with significant
correlation with SA scores (Methods). As a result, the positively correlated genes were
significantly enriched in synaptic related pathways (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c) and cell
adhesion molecules (CAMs, hsa04514) in neural system (Supplementary Fig. 4), suggesting

that the calculated SA score can represent the process of synapse assembly.
In spite of its ability as glioma biomarker for the identified SA gene panel, it should be
especially noted that the result seems opposite to existed knowledge. That is, it was reported
that neuro-glioma synapse could promote tumor progression and metastasis17-19, which thus
can infer that SA should result in a poorer prognosis, however, we revealed it is associated
with a better but not poorer prognosis. Molecular processes may play different roles in
various cells, organs and diseases. For example, as an important discovery in glioma research,
IDH mutation is identified as one of the early events of glioma, and the epigenetic changes
caused by IDH mutation are considered as a main tumor driver

20

. Nevertheless, clinical

studies have found that IDH mutation can lead to a longer survival time

21

. Similarly,

immunotherapy, which has been widely used, was criticized for producing serious side effects
22,23

. These instances suggest that the SA gene panel could also have multiple aspects.
To better understanding the molecular processes of the SA genes, we sought to pathway

analysis. Besides the proliferative effect suggested in previous studies, we revealed that
neuro-glioma synapses may also show a participation in the immune response, cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (cAMP, hsa04024) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB, hsa04064)
pathway (Supplementary Fig. 3b, c). The SA genes are related to the activation of cAMP
pathway (Supplementary Fig. 3c, 5), which has been proved to be involved in the synaptic
plasticity process, including AMPA receptor trafficking, which may be a reason why glioma
cells form synapses and produce AMPA receptors24. Moreover, cAMP can also activate
phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/protein kinase B (PKB, also known as Akt) , thus
promoting cell growth, survival and proliferation, which may be one of the explanations for

the proliferation promotion effect of the newly discovered neuro-glioma synapse 25. Since the
synaptic structure was also observed in the breast-to-brain cancer cells, we hypothesized that
it was not the cell origin but the environment that determined this morphological change in
tumor. It is worth mentioning that the cAMP pathway can be activated by neurotransmitters
and Ca2+, which is extensively distributed in synaptic cleft and easily accessible for
glioma26-28.
The NF-κB signaling pathway and CAMs of immune system were also found to be
vastly enriched with genes negatively associated with SA (Supplementary Fig 3c, 4, 6).
Previous studies on NF-κB are mainly focused on immune cells, which are involved in cell
activation and survival, as well as the production of cytokines29,30. In tumors, the stimulation
of NF-κB signal leads to up-regulation of anti-apoptotic genes that allow tumors to tolerate
inflammatory environment. Meanwhile, NF-κB induces cytokines and CAMs, which give rise
to the recruitment of immune cells to the tumor site31. As can be seen, the relationship
between NF-κB-caused inflammation and cancer is complex, which can either eliminate
cancer cells or lead to immune escape. Additionally, stimulated cAMP could suppress NF-κB
activation

32

. This finding, together with the relationship between NF-κB and CAMs, is in

good agreement with our discoveries. We also demonstrated that SA is associated with IDH
mutation status, which is a momentous survival risk factor. In a previous study, significantly
higher tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) infiltration and programmed death ligand 1
(PD-L1) expression, which are targets of immune checkpoint inhibitor, were found to be
associated with IDH-wt33. However, the others have found that IDH-mut tumors show

polymorphonuclear leukocytes, which are consistent with the decrease of chemokines in
tumors34.
As it was shown in recent studies17-19, the neuro-glioma synapses are involved in cancer
proliferation and metastasis, which are beneficial to tumor progression. But reversely, we
found that higher SA signifies lower glioma grade and longer overall survival. Analogously,
IDH-mut and 1p/19q codeletion are typically biomarkers that promote glioma progression but
benefit prognosis. Existing studies have focused on mechanisms that promote glioma, but the
reasons for better prognosis are generally reported by clinical studies, such as better
chemoradiotherapy sensitivity35. We conjectured that SA, IDH mutation and 1p/19q
codeletion shared a part of the mechanism that resulted in the observed phenomenon.
Apoptosis caused by suppression of NF-κB signaling pathway may also be a motivation. The
causations in SA, mutation, pathway and immune response are remained to be explored.
In summary, we found that SA is associated with activation of the cAMP signaling
pathway and down-regulation of NF-κB pathway and immune-related CAMs. Although the
mechanism is unclear, we revealed that SA genes are involved in glioma process and the
proposed SA score is an independent and potentially better biomarker for glioma overall
survival, and shows a predictive capacity in different grade gliomas and normal brain tissue,
which could be useful in the prognosis, grading and diagnosis of gliomas.

Histology type, WHO grade, IDH mutation status and 1p/19q codeletion status were obtained
from the study by Ceccarelli et al36. CGGA (http://www.cgga.org.cn/) provides tumor gene
expression data for thousands of glioma patients (including one microarray and two RNAseq
batches), as well as corresponding clinical data. The calculation and presentation of the results
will be conducted separately due to different platforms and batches. In addition, glioma

correlated genes were selected respectively and the results of four datasets were intersected. R
package clusterProfiler37 (v3.10.1) was used for GO and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis. P values were adjusted by Benjamini and
Hochberg methods and background genes were set as genes which exist in all four datasets.

KEGG pathway graphs were rendered by R package pathview38 (v1.22.3).
Statistical analysis. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves and Cox proportional hazards regression
were performed by R package survival (v2.44-1.1) and survminer (v0.4.6). Log rank test was
used to calculate the difference between two K-M curves. Significance of difference between
two groups of continuous variables was analyzed by two-side Wilcoxon rank sum test.
Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and area under ROC curve (AUROC) were
processed by R package pROC39 (v1.15.3). All statistical significances above were calculated
by R (v3.5.2). Spearman’s correlation analysis was applied to evaluate the correlation using
python package scipy (v1.2.1). P values < 0.05 were considered significant.
