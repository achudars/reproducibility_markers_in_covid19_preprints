ABSTRACT

59
60

Introduction: Liver disease is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in sub-Saharan Africa. However,

61

its prevalence, distribution and aetiology have not been well characterised. We examined liver function

62

tests (LFTs) and calculated liver fibrosis scores in a rural population in Uganda.

63

Methodology: A cross-sectional survey of LFTs was undertaken in 2011 in a rural population cohort in

64

South-Western Uganda. We classified abnormal LFTs based on reference ranges set in America and in

65

Africa. We derived fibrosis scores (AST to Platelet Ratio Index, fibrosis-4, GGT to platelet ratio, red cell

66

distribution width to platelet ratio, and S-index) to evaluate the potential prevalence of liver disease. We

67

collected information about alcohol intake, and infection with HIV, HBV and HCV, to determine the

68

contribution made by these factors to liver inflammation or fibrosis.

69

Results: Data were available for 8,099 participants (median age 30 years; 56% female). The prevalence

70

of HBV, HCV and HIV infection were 3%, 0.2% and 8%, respectively. The prevalence of abnormal LFTs

71

was higher based on the American reference range compared to the African reference range (e.g. for AST

72

13% vs 3%, respectively). The prevalence of AST/ALT ratio >2 was 11%, suggestive of alcoholic

73

hepatitis. The highest prevalence of fibrosis was suggested by the GPR score, with 24% of the

74

population falling above the threshold for fibrosis. By multivariate analysis, elevated LFTs and fibrosis

75

scores were most consistently associated with older age, male sex, being under-weight, infection with

76

HIV or HBV, and alcohol consumption. Based on population attributable risk, the highest proportion of

77

elevated fibrosis scores was associated with alcohol use (e.g. 64% of elevated S-index scores).

78

Conclusion: Further work is required to determine normal reference ranges for LFTs in this setting, to

79

evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of fibrosis scores, and to determine aetiology of liver disease.

INTRODUCTION

107

Liver disease causes an estimated 200,000 deaths each year in sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) as a result of

108

liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (1). More than 80% of Africa’s burden of liver disease has

109

been attributed to endemic blood borne virus (BBV) infections, such as HIV, hepatitis B (HBV) and

110

hepatitis C (HCV), alcohol, hepatotoxic medications (including traditional and herbal medicines), non-

111

alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and exposure to aflatoxins (1–3). However, the prevalence,

112

distribution and aetiology of liver disease in many parts of Africa have not been well characterised, and

113

the neglect of cirrhosis has recently been highlighted (2). In order to improve screening for liver disease,

114

and to implement appropriate investigations and intervention, we have undertaken a survey of liver

115

function tests (LFTs) together with demographic data for a large rural cohort in South-Western Uganda

116

(4).

117

118

LFTs are usually the first approach to evaluation of liver disease (reference ranges and causes of

119

derangement are summarised in Suppl Table 1). In addition, liver synthetic function can be assessed by

120

measuring prothrombin time; platelet production may be decreased in chronic liver disease due to

121

hypersplenism, decreased thrombopoietin levels and bone marrow suppression (5). Abnormal LFTs are

122

often non-specific and can arise transiently in association with many acute illnesses or usage of

123

medications. However, persistent derangement can indicate chronic liver disease, with associated

124

morbidity and mortality (6). The pattern of derangement can sometimes help to establish aetiology – for

125

example AST/ALT ratio >2 is characteristically associated with alcoholic hepatitis (7,8).

126

127

Determination of the origin of liver disease and ascertainment of treatment requirements necessitates

128

accurate characteristation of the degree of liver disease. Liver biopsy allows objective grading of fibrosis

129

and can provide information about the likely aetiology of liver disease based on specific changes to

130

cellular architecture. However, biopsy is costly, requires experts to undertake the procedure and analyse

131

samples, and exposes patients to potentially life-threatening risks. Imaging can also be employed to

132

assess fibrosis. Typically, this comprises ultrasound-based techniques, including fibroscan to derive

133

elastography scores. In most low and middle-income settings, evaluation of liver disease currently

134

depends on use of non-invasive (blood) markers, combined with ultrasound and/or fibroscan when

135

available.

136

137

Non-invasive fibrosis blood tests are relatively simple and offer a safe route to assess for liver fibrosis,

138

appealing in resource limited settings. Scores of liver fibrosis, such as AST to Platelet Ratio Index (APRI),

139

fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), GGT to platelet ratio (GPR), red cell distribution width to platelet ratio (RPR) and S-

140

index have been derived using liver enzymes (ALT, AST, GGT) in combination with platelet count.

141

However diagnostic accuracy is not well established in sSA and can be influenced by the population

142

being assessed and the nature of underlying liver disease (9–14). GPR has recently been reported as an

143

independent predictor of significant fibrosis in treatment naïve Gambian patients with chronic hepatitis B

144

(CHB) infection (12). However, further studies are needed to determine the specificity and sensitivity of

145

different scores in different settings.

146

147

Appropriate reference ranges for LFTs are crucial for optimising the detection of underlying liver disease

148

(15). Application of reference ranges defined in one setting to different populations may lead to either

149

under- or over-estimation of abnormalities (15–17). As well as being dependent on the population being

150

assessed, the distribution of LFTs in any given setting can also be influenced by the type of instrument,

151

reagents used, and the strength of quality assurance (17). Efforts have been made to establish

152

‘population-specific’ reference ranges (16,18); one example is through the application of cross-sectional

153

data from seven South-Eastern African countries (16). However, such local reference ranges for Africa

154

have been derived from cross-sectional data collected in adults without addressing the potential

155

prevalence of underlying liver disease. Thus, while American reference ranges potentially over-estimate of

156

the burden of liver disease in an African setting, it is also possible that locally derived reference ranges

157

under-estimate the burden (as they are based on thresholds that have been derived from populations in

158

which liver disease is highly prevalent).

159

160

We here set out to assess LFTs and fibrosis scores derived from a large, well defined population cohort in

161

rural South-Western Uganda (19). We applied reference ranges set in both America and in Africa (16,20),

162

in order to assess the possible burden of liver disease, highlighting the discrepancies that arise as a result

163

of the difference between thresholds. We derived fibrosis scores to further evaluate the potential

164

prevalence of liver disease in this setting and to estimate the contributions of alcohol and BBVs to the

165
166
167

burden of disease.

168

Study design and study population

169

We conducted a cross-sectional study in a rural population in Kyamulibwa, in the Kalungu district of

170

South-Western Uganda as part of the survey of the General Population Cohort (GPC). The GPC is a

171

community-based cohort established in 1989 with funding from the UK Medical Research Council (MRC)

172

in collaboration with the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) (21). Regular census and medical

173

surveys have been conducted in this population cohort. In 2011, data collection included screening for

174

viral hepatitis and LFTs among 8,145 adults (≥16 years), which we used for this analysis.

175

176

Data collection

177

Demographic and health history data were collected using questionnaires and standardised procedures

178

described elsewhere (21,22). Blood samples were drawn at home and transported for testing at the

179

Medical Research Council central laboratories in Entebbe. LFTs (serum AST, ALT, ALP, GGT and BR)

180

were measured using a Cobas Integra 400 plus machine, with Roche reagents. Screening for HIV testing

181

was done using an algorithm recommended by the Uganda Ministry of Health, based on initial screening

182

with a rapid test. If the test result was negative, the participant was considered to be HIV negative. If the

183

test result was positive, the sample was re-tested with the rapid test HIV-1 or -2 Stat-Pak. If both tests

184

resulted in a positive result, the participant was diagnosed as HIV positive. If the tests gave discordant

185

results, the sample was further evaluated with the rapid test Uni-Gold Recombinant HIV-1/2. For those

186

samples assessed by all three tests, two positive test results were interpreted as positive, and two

187

negative results were considered negative. HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) testing was conducted using

188

Cobas HBsAg II (2011-08 V10), and those who tested positive were invited for further serologic testing.

189

HCV was tested using a combination of immunoassays followed by PCR, as previously described (23).

190

Normal serum levels of liver enzymes were classified according to the American reference range (ARR,

191

MGH Clinical Laboratories) and Local Reference Ranges (LRR, (16); Suppl Table 1). We excluded

192

individuals ≤19 years from ALP analysis, since elevated ALP can be attributable to bone growth in

193

teenagers.

194

195

Data from the full blood count was used to calculate fibrosis scores (mean corpuscular volume, MCV

196

and platelet count). This was collected starting part-way through the 2011 data collection period; the

197

data are, therefore, population-based, although based on only a subset of the whole cohort (n=1,877).

198

199

Calculation of fibrosis scores and AST/ALT ratio

200

Where data were available (n=1,877), we calculated APRI, FIB-4, GPR, RPR and S-Index. The formulae

201

for calculating these scores are presented in Suppl Table 2, along with the sensitivity and specificity of

202

each, based on previous studies. We used previously established thresholds to suggest the presence of

203

liver fibrosis, as follows: APRI >0.7 (24), FIB-4 >3.25 (25), GPR >0.32 (12), RPR >0.825 (26), S-index

204

>0.3 (27). We calculated AST/ALT ratio; a score >2 has been associated with alcoholic hepatitis (8).

Statistical Analysis

207

We analysed data using standard statistical software, Stata/IC 13 (Stata Corporation, College Station,

208

USA) and GraphPad Prism v7.0. We summarised participant baseline characteristics using proportions

209

(%) and these were stratified by sex. We reported prevalence and distribution of LFTs, laboratory markers

210

of fibrosis and elastography scores using descriptive statistics. We reported p-values from chi-square

211

tests, comparing the proportions of each potential risk factor between male and female participants.

212

213

We used logistic regression in our univariate and multivariate analyses, using the threshold for

214

significance set at 0.05, to estimate the odd ratios (OR), along with its 95% confidence intervals (95% CI),

215

to identify potential factors associated with abnormal LFTs and liver fibrosis scores, using a forward

216

stepwise approach to develop our multivariate models. We added risk factors that were identified in the

217

age and sex adjusted univariate analysis to the multivariate model. The final multivariate models for each

218

LFT and liver fibrosis score were obtained by excluding variables in the final model until all remaining

219

variables were associated with abnormal LFTs and liver fibrosis scores at the p<0.05 threshold. Once the

220

final multivariate model had been established, variables that were eliminated through this forward

221

stepwise approach were added back to the model and were reported if associated at the p<0.05

222

threshold, to reduce the effects of residual confounding. Due to the low number of individuals with active

223

HCV infection at the time of the study, we did not include this sub-group in univariate or multivariate

224

analysis. These HCV RNA positive individuals have been described in more detail elsewhere (28). We

225

present results of multivariate analysis in the form of Forrest plots generated using Microsoft Excel. A

RESULTS

236

Characteristics of study population

237

We analysed complete data for 8,099 participants (Suppl Table 3). Compared to females, there were

238

more males who were HBV positive, (prevalence 3% vs 2%, respectively; p<0.001) and had consumed

239

alcohol in the past 30 days, (40% vs 33%, respectively; p<0.001). More females were HIV positive (9%

240

vs 6%, respectively; p<0.001). Males were more likely to be underweight (31% vs 16%), and females to

241

be overweight (18% vs 5%); p<0.001 in both cases.

242

243

Proportion of population defined as having abnormal LFTs varies according to the reference

244

range that is applied

245

The proportion of the population falling above the upper limit of normal (ULN) for each parameter is

246

shown in Table 1, with ALT, AST and GGT distributions in Fig 1A-C (full data for all LFTs are shown in

247

Suppl Fig 1). These results highlight the different burden of disease that can be estimated according to

248

the reference range that is applied, with a higher proportion of the population falling above the ULN

249

when the ARR was applied compared to the LRR (Fig 1A, B). Most striking, for AST, 13% of the

250

population had a value that was deemed to be elevated based on ARR, compared to only 3% based on

251

the LRR (Fig 1B). Using the ARR, ALT and BR were significantly more likely to be above the ULN in

252

males than in females, and ALP was more likely to be higher in females (p<0.001 in each case, Table 1).

253

These sex differences were not apparent when the LRR was applied. OR for deranged LFTs and fibrosis

254

scores according to age and sex is shown in Suppl. fig 2.

255

256

The highest prevalence of liver fibrosis is predicted using the GPR score

257

We calculated APRI, FIB-4, GPR, RPR and S-index scores (Table 1). The estimated prevalence of

258

fibrosis was highest when based on GPR score (23.5%; Fig 1D), compared to FIB-4 (5.3%), APRI

259

(3.2%), S-index (3.9%) and RPR (0.1%). We excluded RPR scores from further statistical analysis

260

because so few individuals were classified as having an elevated score (we therefore did not have

261

statistical power to detect any factors associated with abnormal score). Because the APRI is derived

262

using the ULN of AST, the proportion of the population classified as having a score consistent with liver

263

fibrosis changes according to whether the ARR or LRR is used (Table 1). Based on previous validation

264

among African individuals, there is evidence to suggest that GPR is the most accurate score for staging

265

liver fibrosis (12); applying this approach, there is a prevalence of almost 1 in 4 adults with liver fibrosis

266
267

in this population.

268

Evidence for the contribution of alcohol to liver disease

269

The prevalence of AST/ALT ratio >2, suggestive of alcoholic hepatitis, was 11% (888/8,099) (Fig 1E).

270

There was a significant relationship between self-reported alcohol consumption and elevated AST/ALT

271

ratio (p<0.001; Suppl Fig 3). However, 57% of participants with AST/ALT ratio >2 reported never having

272

consumed alcohol (Fig 1E), possibly reflecting either under-reporting of alcohol use and/or other factors

273

that underpin this pattern of LFTs. Self-reported alcohol consumption was associated with raised LFTs,

274

as follows: ALT (Adj. OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.09,1.63) AST (Adj. OR 1.53, 95% CI 1.30, 1.78) GGT (Adj.

275

OR 2.00 95% CI 1.69, 2.36), and with abnormal fibrosis scores, particularly GPR (Adj. OR 1.96, 95%

276

CI 1.52, 2.54). All ORs, adjusted ORs, their respective 95% confidence intervals and p-values are

277

shown in Table 2, and selected variables in Fig 2.

278

279

A raised GGT level in combination with AST/ALT ratio >2 can be used to increase the sensitivity of

280

detection of alcoholic hepatitis (8). GGT levels were significantly higher among males with AST/ALT ratio

281

≥2 (p<0.001), but there was no relationship between GGT and AST/ALT ratio in females (p=0.7); Suppl

282

Fig 4. This potentially indicates that alcohol is of more influence as a cause of an elevated AST/ALT ratio

283

in men than in women. There was no significant association between AST/ALT ratio ≥2 and the presence

284

of an elevated GPR score, predicting fibrosis (p=0.2; data not shown). We calculated population

285

attributable risk (PAR) as a way to assess the relative contribution of different risk factors to the overall

286

burden of liver disease; Table 3. Overall, the most striking contribution arose from reported alcohol

287

consumption, which accounted for 64% of abnormal S-index scores, 32% of elevated FIB-4 scores, and

288

19% of GPR abnormalities.

index

292

Females were less likely to have high fibrosis scores based on FIB-4 compared to males (Adj. OR:

293

0.6), APRI (Adj. OR: 0.42), and S-Index (Adj. OR: 0.37) compared to males. FIB-4 score increased

294

markedly with age: adults aged 40 – 49 (Adj. OR: 7.04), 50 – 59 (Adj. OR: 11.29), and adults >60

295

years (Adj. OR: 25.15) were more likely to have a higher FIB-4 than individuals < 39 years. Elevated

296

BMI was associated only with a rise in GGT (Adj. OR: 1.47). However, being underweight was

297

associated with a more pronounced pattern of liver derangement, including elevations in ALT (Adj. OR:

1.40), AST (Adj. OR: 1.44), GGT (Adj. OR: 1.37), abnormal fibrosis scores (APRI Adj. OR: 1.72,) and

Relationship between BBV infection and liver disease

302

HIV infection was associated with abnormal liver function tests, with significant OR for increased ALT,

303

AST, ALP and GGT, as well as with raised GPR and S-index (on univariate and multivariate analysis;

304

Table 2). HBV infection was significantly associated with a rise in hepatic transaminases (OR for raised

305

ALT and AST 2.6 and 2.4 respectively, on multivariate analysis), and with liver fibrosis as measured by

306

APRI and GPR (OR 3.6 and 4.2 respectively, on multivariate analysis). We investigated the prevalence

307

of BBV infection among individuals with raised fibrosis scores. There was an association between the

308

presence of HIV or HBV and raised GPR (p=0.005) and S-Index (p<0.001). Therefore, GPR and S-

309

Index may be the most sensitive markers of inflammation and/or fibrosis in the context of HBV or HIV

310

infection. HIV and HBV were associated with a lesser proportion of liver disease than alcohol based on

311

calculation of PAR (Table 3), but still contributed to elevations in both LFTs and fibrosis scores. The OR

312

for deranged LFTs/fibrosis scores in the context of HIV or HBV infection is shown in Fig 2.

313

314

Liver disease of unknown aetiology

315

Among individuals with GPR>0.32, 33.8% had either BBV infection or had AST/ALT>2 (suggesting

316

potential alcoholic hepatitis) (Fig 1D; Suppl Fig 5). However, this illustrates that 66% have raised fibrosis

317

scores in the absence of a history of alcohol use, or HIV or HBV infection, suggesting that other factors

318

unaccounted for in this study are likely to be contributing to the overall burden of liver disease. True

319

prevalence of liver disease cannot be ascertained until reference ranges have been more carefully

320

defined, correlating LFTs and fibrosis scores with the confirmed presence of underlying liver disease

321

based on imaging or biopsy.

322

323

DISCUSSION

324

Liver disease is not well characterised in many parts of sSA despite the high prevalence of HIV and HBV,

325

and potential exposure to hepatotoxins (1,3). In this study, we used cross-sectional data from a large

326

population cohort to estimate the burden of liver disease and to assess the possible impact of BBV

327

infection and alcohol consumption. The prevalence of abnormal LFTs depends on the reference range

328

that is applied. The ARR suggests a higher prevalence of liver disease, therefore including more false-

329

positives. The LRR was established based on individuals recruited from several countries across Africa

330

(Rwanda, Uganda, Kenya, Zambia) (16). While the values were derived from purportedly healthy adults, it

331

is impossible to rule out a high background prevalence of underlying liver disease; in defining higher

332

values for the ULN of all tests, the LRR is more susceptible to false-negatives if used to screen for liver

333

disease.

334

335

LFTs are a blunt tool for assessment of liver health, with many potential confounding factors. This current

336

study only accounts for a limited range of aetiological agents, and we did not include other potentially

337

relevant factors such as Schistosomiasis infection, exposure to aflatoxin and use of traditional

338

medications. Furthermore, LFTs were measured at only one point in time, potentially overcalling liver

339

disease as a result of transient abnormalities.

341

Composite fibrosis scores have been developed with the aim of improving sensitivity of detection of liver

342

disease (29), but these scores also depend on platelet count which can be influenced by diverse factors.

343

For example, in some African populations, thrombocytopenia is common due to infections such as

344

malaria, schistosomiasis, HIV or endemic parasites, as well as being influenced by inflammatory

345

conditions and certain drugs (9,10). We only had platelet counts for a sub-set of our study population,

346

limiting the number for whom we could determine APRI, FIB-4, GPR, S-Index and RPR scores. Data

347

surrounding the use of these scores in sSA is variable, but since in many low-income settings alternative

348

diagnostic equipment is unavailable, non-invasive approaches are vital to estimate liver damage and to

349

stratify clinical management decisions.

350

351

APRI and FIB-4 are currently recommended by the World Health Organisation (WHO) for assessment of

352

hepatic fibrosis in patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection (30,31). However, there is evidence

353

showing that APRI is more accurate in assessing liver fibrosis among individuals with chronic HCV

354

compared to HBV infection (11). GPR and S-Index have been validated in small studies in sSA, and have

355

been associated with improved classification of liver fibrosis in chronic HBV infection when compared to

356

APRI and FIB-4 (12–14). It is apparent that either larger studies, or indeed a meta-analysis, are required

357

to further assess the accuracy of these tests in different populations. GPR and S-index may be

358

worthwhile options to include in routine clinical practice to assess for liver fibrosis in African populations,

359

given the high burden of HBV in this continent (32,33). RPR has been used to detect fibrosis among

360

individuals with chronic HBV in China (26), however this score was excluded from our analysis due to a

361

very small number of individuals falling above the suggested threshold for fibrosis.

362

363

The prevalence of AST/ALT ratio >2 in this population is 11%, suggesting potential alcoholic hepatitis

364

(34), concordant with a previous study in Uganda in which 10% of the population was estimated to have

365

alcoholic hepatitis (35), and with data from Uganda's non-communicable diseases risk factor survey which

366

estimated that almost 10% of Ugandan adults have alcohol use disorders (36). Data from emergency

367

attendances at Mulago Hospital in Kampala recorded 47% who reported alcohol use, while 21% and

368

10% met the study definitions of alcoholic misuse and alcoholic liver disease, respectively (35). Our

369

data are based on self-reported alcohol consumption so may underestimate the true extent of alcohol use.

370

We were unable to quantify alcohol intake or the nature of the alcohol consumed: this is challenging as

371

alcohol is often home-brewed or home-distilled from locally grown grains or fruits, and the alcohol content

372

may vary widely; e.g. the alcohol content of locally produced maize-based brews and liquor in Kenya

373

ranged from 2%-7% and 18%-53%, respectively (36). The global challenge of morbidity and mortality

374

associated with alcohol use is highlighted by recent studies from the Global Burden of Disease

375

consortium, in which alcohol ranks as the seventh highest cause of DALYs and deaths and worldwide

376

(2), and together with HBV infection is a leading aetiological agent of liver cancer (37).

377

378

Abnormal LFTs are common in HIV infection for diverse reasons including direct cytopathic effects of HIV

379

on the hepatocytes, co-infection with other BBVs, opportunistic infection, malignancy, ART or other drugs,

380

or secondary to other factors such as alcoholism (38–41). Although a proportion of our study population

381

with fibrosis were infected with BBV (21.6%) and/or had a history of alcohol consumption (12.2%), there

382

was a residual proportion with scores suggestive of fibrosis and AST/ALT ratio >2 who cannot be

383

accounted for through either alcohol or BBV infection. This implies that other factors contribute towards

384

liver dysfunction in this population; a recently published article reported approximately 30% of liver

385

cirrhosis in Africa are not attributed to HBV, HCV, or alcohol misuse and could be as a result of other

386

understudied factors such as NAFLD and use of traditional medicine (35). Aflatoxin exposure is

387

associated with liver cirrhosis and is among the major causes of hepatocellular carcinoma globally, with

388

most cases reported from sSA. Within a previous study of the GPC, >90% of individuals had evidence of

389

exposure (42–44).

390

391

In our population women were significantly more likely to be overweight women than men. This may be

392

associated with a higher incidence of NAFLD in women. However, typically only mild rises in ALT are

393

seen, and 80% of those with NAFLD have normal LFTs (45–47) so may not be identified within our current

394

dataset. Diagnosis of NAFLD therefore depends on ultrasound scan (USS); previous studies have

395

consistently shown 70-80% of obese patients have NAFLD on imaging (46,48,49). These imaging

396

modalities were not available in our population, so we are unable to comment specifically on the possible

397

prevalence of NAFLD. Interestingly, in this setting low body weight was more associated with deranged

398

LFTs and with biochemical evidence of liver fibrosis, suggesting a range of pathology that may contribute

399

to liver disease, including organ-specific effects of under-nutrition or stunting (37), as well as the effect of

400

general systemic illness. Further studies are required to investigate the specific relationship between BMI

401

and liver fibrosis in African populations.

402

403

In African populations, HCV infection has frequently been often over-reported due to a reliance on HCV-

404

antibody (HCV-Ab) testing, which detects not only current infection but also previous exposure, and is

405

known to be susceptible to false positive results (28). In this cohort, 298/8145 (3.7%) individuals tested

406

HCV-Ab positive, but among these only 13 were HCV RNA positive (overall prevalence 13/8145 =

407

0.2%).

409

Appropriate reference ranges for LFTs are necessary to contribute to an understanding of the burden and

410

aetiology of liver disease. Further work is required to determine appropriate thresholds for the ULN of

411

different parameters in different settings in sSA, and to determine which fibrosis score is most specific,

412

through application of a more widespread approach to elastography and/or other imaging. At present, we

413

have identified alcohol, HIV and HBV as risk factors for deranged LFTs and liver fibrosis, with a striking

414

contribution made by alcohol, but further investigation is needed to determine other risk factors that

415

contribute to liver disease in this setting.
