Abstract

20

Despite the use of antiviral prophylaxis, the active cytomegalovirus (CMV) replication is still

21

occurred in the seropositive kidney recipients. The aim of this study was to assess the

22

incidence of CMV reactivation and potential risk factors associated with CMV disease. Data

23

of sixty kidney transplant recipients who had received CMV prophylaxis were obtained

24

between 2013 and 2017. Quantitative nucleic acid amplification testing for CMV viraemia

25

was assessed using Abbott RealTime Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Among the

seropositive recipients, cumulative incidence for reactivation was 63%. In patients with

27

quantitative viraemia, the time of active replication was significantly lower compared to

28

those with detectable viraemia (141.5 ± 96.9 vs 294.1 ± 112.6 days, P < 0.001). During

29

prophylactic treatment, 46.7% of patients with quantifiable viraemia had experienced active

30

replication and none among patients with detectable viraemia (P= 0.017). Importantly,

31

symptomatic reactivation was significantly observed in the younger patients with higher peak

32

viraemia compared to those with symptoms free (28.8 ± 5.12 vs. 38.1 ± 12.34 years, P=

33

0.007) and 3.8 ± 1.59 vs. 2.4 ± 0. 79 log10IU/ml, P = 0.003, respectively). Furthermore, the

34

median duration of viraemia (21.2, vs. 13.4 days, P= 0.028) and period of CMV therapy (24.3

35

vs 12.3 days, P <0.001) were significantly longer for this group. In addition, intercurrent

36

infections (75% vs. 23%, P = 0.028 ) and acute rejection (50 % vs 0%, P = 0.003) were

37

significantly more frequent in symptomatic reactivation group. In addition, peak viral load

38

was a potential risk factor for development of symptomatic reactivation with odds ratio 3.39,

39

95%CI=1.21-9.53, P = 0.02). In conclusion, CMV reactivation remains serious problem for

40

seropositive recipients who were expected to be on antiviral prophylaxis. Patients with high

41

level of viraemia may be at an increased risk of progression to CMV disease and adverse

42

outcomes.

Introduction

44

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is an ubiquitous herpesvirus, which causes the

45

common complication in immunocompromised individuals, including the transplant

46

recipients [1–3]. In the absence of antiviral treatment, CMV disease occurs in up to 60 % of

47

transplant recipients [4].

48

In patients receiving a kidney transplant, CMV plays a critical role in direct induction

49

of infection syndrome and severity disease [5, 6]. Moreover, it can be responsible indirectly

50

for decreased graft function with increased morbidity such intercurrent infections,

51

cardiovascular disease, malignancies or graft loss and long term mortality [7–10]. Previously,

52

seropositive donor with seronegative recipient were considered as high serologically risk

53

patients of occurrence CMV disease [11,12]. But, the risk is also observed currently in

54

seropositive recipients who are exposed to CMV reactivation or reinfection by novel strain of

55

donor [13]. The virus reactivation from latency are likely to occur in immunosuppressed

56

patients receiving intensive immunosuppressive agents and may have serious clinical effects

57

after kidney transplantation [14,15]. Therefore, antiviral prophylaxis is usually recommended

58

for a short period with three months of treatment by recent consensus guidelines [16].

59

However, the active CMV replication is still occurred in the D+/R+ population over the first

60

three months of prophylaxis [17,18], and associated with CMV viraemia or with late-onset

61

disease [19–21]. Furthermore, CMV recurrence infections can be developed after the first

62

episode of reactivation in this group [22– 24]. However, Several studies focused for

63

investigation in recipients of various solid organ transplant or in the high- risk kidney patients

64

(D+/R-) [25, 26]. In addition, a majority of the experts proposed for prevention prophylaxis ,

65

the use of oral valganciclovir or ganciclovir as antiviral medication for three months [5,14].

66

But, no recent data is known about the risk of CMV disease after reactivation or recurrence in

67

seropositive patients treated with valaciclovir up to three months post kidney-transplantation.

68

For the present study, only the recipients with specific Ig G antibodies receiving

69

allograft from CMV seropositive donors were taken into account. Furthermore,

70

immunosuppression is frequently

71

between 3 to 6 months for all recipients with oral valaciclovir (VACV) or valganciclovir

72

(VGCV). For these reasons, it is of major importance to identify the clinical outcomes of

73

CMV reactivation and to explore the potential risk factors associated with CMV disease after

74

renal transplantation especially in the recipient seropositive population. The aims of this study

75

were to assess the incidence of CMV reactivation and to determine potential risk factors

conservative and antiviral prophylaxis is performed

Immunosuppressive regimen and CMV treatment

112

For the most patients of this study, rabbit antithymocyte globulin (rATG/

113

Thymoglobuline) has been used as induction therapy and those with high risk of rejection had

114

received basiliximab induction during the first week post transplantation. The induction

115

therapy was given in association with calcineurin inhibitors (tacrolimus or ciclosporin).

116

Generally, immunosuppressive

regimen was based usually on tacrolimus (Tac),

119

Renal graft rejection was diagnosed by renal transplant biopsy and treated with high –

120

dose intravenous corticosteroids and /or switch to tacrolimus if they were initially treated with

121

cyclosporine.

122

CMV prophylaxis was administered for all patients during three to six months after

123

transplantation with following drugs: oral valaciclovir (VLC) or oral valganciclovir (VGCV)

124

with dosage according to our center practice. Valaciclovir was routinely given at dose 4.5 to 6

125

g once daily and the use of valganciclovir involved for patients with early viral replication at

126

dose 450 mg or 900 mg/ day, dose adjusted according to renal function (estimated glomerular

127

diet of renal disease calculated eGFRD by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease equation

128

MDRD).

129

Patients experiencing CMV viraemia without syndrome or disease were classified as

130

asymptomatic viraemia and monitored for CMV DNAemia by RealTime PCR methods until

131

eradication without interventions. If CMV disease was suspected or some patients had high

132

viral load in the absence of clinical signs, a i.v. ganciclovir (250 mg or 500 mg twice daily)

133

was given as main treatment (dose adjusted for renal function). CMV treatment was stopped

134

after CMV DNAemia was undetectable for two consecutive tests. Fewer patients with mild

135

infection or with low viral load had received a valaciclovir (6g/day) or valganciclovir (450-

136

1800 mg/day) as preemptive or curative treatment.

137

No antiviral treatment was given to patients with kidney function impairment but a

138

reduction of immunosuppression was adopted. Second treatment prophylaxis with

139

valaciclovir was initiated for patients with risk of recurrence.

140

Outcomes variables

141

According to the internationals consensus guidelines and clinical studies definitions

142

[16,27]; CMV infection was defined as “evidence of CMV replication regardless of

143

symptoms (differs from latent CMV), or as detection of viral proteins (antigens), or nucleic

144

acid in any body fluid or tissue specimen”. Asymptomatic viraemia was defined as “presence

145

of quantitative viral load without CMV related clinical symptoms.”

146

CMV disease was categorized as “evidence of CMV infection with attributable symptoms”.

147

CMV disease can be further categorized as “viral syndrome (ie, fever, malaise, leukopenia,

148

and/or thrombocytopenia), or as tissue invasive” [16]. CMV Reactivation was defined as an

149

active viral DNA replication in recipient who had been previously infected by CMV before

150

kidney transplantation. Recurrent cytomegalovirus infection was defined as detectable or

151

measurement of CMV viral load after the first infection episode (achieving initial clearance)

152

[22]. In addition, a detectable viraemia was defined as being the detection of CMV DNA

153

below the quantification threshold (< 1.49 log10 IU/ml) using Abbott RealTime CMV assay.

154

For each patient, Baseline data, follow-up data and data about CMV infections and

155

clinical symptoms were collected from individual patient records. Extracted Baseline data

156

were age recipient at transplant, gender, date of transplantation, previous renal replacement

157

therapy modality (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, or none of patients with preemptive

158

transplantation), primary renal disease, presence of comorbidities, HLA matching (HLA- AB

159

and DR), induction therapy and initial immunosuppressive regimen. For donor, we also

160

recorded demographic characteristics, source of donors (living, deceased), pretransplant CMV

161

serostatus, immunological and serological characteristics.

162

The follow-up data included liver function test (ALT, AST), immunological follow-up (anti-

163

HLA I and II antibodies), renal function (creatinine and clearance creatine), monitoring of

164

blood count (leukocytes, polynuclear neutrophils, lymphocytes). Data recorded with regard to

165

CMV prophylaxis treatment were the type of antiviral drug (valaciclovir, valganciclovir),

166

doses and duration of prophylaxis treatment. Viraemia data at the time of follow-up included

167

quantification of measurement viral load at diagnosis, the peak viral load, duration of

168

quantifiable viraemia, number of reactivation episodes, duration of onset of replication after

169

transplantation, at the time of prophylactic treatment, after discontinuation of treatment and

170

during posttransplant follow-up. The data of CMV infection included clinical findings as

171

clinicals syndrome with fever, malaise, vomiting, asthenia and headaches or as symptoms

172

disease (diarrhea, colitis, hepatitis, pneumonitis…), Whereas data of immunosuppression

173

treatment during infection covered the types of immunosuppressive drugs and their dosage.

174

Other assessed data included antiviral drugs curative treatment received against CMV

175

(ganciclovir, valganciclovir, and valaciclovir), the length of curative duration and treatment of

176

second prophylaxis (type of drug, length of prophylaxis duration). Occurrence of co-infection

177

as viral infections (BK virus, HBV, HCV, EBV), bacterial infection or fungal infections and

178

acute rejection has been also included.

179

CMV assessments by quantitative PCR -CMV

180

CMV viraemia was assessed every month during CMV prophylaxis, then just one at the

181

time of discontinuation prophylaxis. After the cessation of prophylaxis, patients were

182

monitored once per month during 90 days. All CMV plasma samples were tested at Central

183

Laboratory of Virology using Abbott RealTime CMV assay (Abbott Molecular System Inc.,

184

Des Plaines, IL, USA). The review was conducted from March 2013, date of introduction of

186

to the World Health Organization WHO international CMV quantitative standard (National

187

Institute for biological Standards and Control [NIBSC] code 09/162; NIBSC, Hertfordshire,

188

Great Britain) [28]. The threshold of detection was 1.49 log10 IU/ml (31.2 IU/ml) and our

189

results were reported in log10 IU/ml.

190

Statistical analysis

191

Demographic, clinical, transplant, immunosuppression treatment and antiviral features

192

were described using mean ± standard deviation and /or median for quantitative data.

193

Categorial data were expressed as frequency and proportion. For estimating the timing of

194

CMV reactivation after transplantation, we had used the Kaplan-Meir method. Comparisons

195

in variables distribution between groups were done by using t- student or Mann-Whitney U-

196

test for continuous variables and Fischer’s exact test or chi-square test for categorial variables.

197

In addition, univariate logistic regression models were applied for prediction either of CMV

198

symptomatic infection, quantitative viraemia and recurrence. We then selected the most

199

significant variables to define risk factor. The Results from the logistic regression were

200

expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI). A p- value < 0.05 was

201

considered significant and the calculations of data were performed with SPSS v.13 (SPSS,

202

Inc., Chicago, Il, USA).

Incidence of CMV reactivation

205

During the 4-years period (2013-2017), a total of 60 recipients seropositive were

206

analyzed. The mean follow-up after transplantation was 795 ± 444 days [120 - 1580] during

207

which one patient had died (1.7%) and another recipient (1.7%) returned to dialysis. The

208

cause of death was malignancy and the loss of graft was due to primary hyperoxaluria. Most

209

of transplant patients (83%) received thymoglobulin followed by tacrolimus monotherapy

first episode of reactivation/reinfection after kidney transplantation. The incidence rate of

212

CMV reactivation was 27 per 100 person -year and median time to reactivation was at 227

213

days [14- 1560 days]. Figure 2 depicts the timing of CMV reactivation after kidney

In the context of CMV viraemia, thirty out of the reactivated patients (78.9%) had at

262

least one episode of quantitative viral load (mean = 2.4 ± 1.19 log IU/ml) with [1.49 to 6.79]

263

log IU/ml. Eight (21.1%) patients had developed one episode of detectable viraemia below

264

the quantification threshold (<1.49log10IU/ml).

265

Significantly lower period of viral replication after transplantation was observed

266

among the transplant patients with CMV quantifiable viral load compared to patients with

267

only detectable viraemia (141.5 ± 96.9 vs. 294.1 ± 112.4 days, P < 0.001). Furthermore, A

268

reactivation at the time of prophylactic treatment was significantly more frequent in patients

269

who experienced a quantifiable viral load, compared to patients with only detectable viraemia

270

(14 (47%) vs. 0 (0%), P = 0.017). Nevertheless, reactivation with quantifiable viral load

271

occurred earlier after the end of prophylaxis in patients who presented an important level viral

272

load (78.1 ± 70.3 vs. 166.8 ± 118.3 days, P = 0.06). Interestingly, no differences were

273

observed in the total average of leukocyte, neutrophils polynuclear or lymphocytes counts at

274

diagnosis between patients with or without quantifiable viraemia. Additional CMV viraemia

275

related outcomes are shown in Table 2.

294

CMV disease occurred in eight (13%) of the transplanted population. Among patients

295

with quantifiable viraemia, CMV infection progressed to CMV syndrome or disease in 8/30

296

(27%) and 22/30 (73%) of reactivated patients were with asymptomatic viraemia.

297

The incidence rate of symptomatic reactivation was six patients per 100 person-year.

298

Most symptomatic recipients developed CMV syndrome or disease within the first five

299

months from solid organ transplantation (7/8, 87.5%). The CMV syndrome was diagnosed in

300

2/8 (25%) of symptomatic patients and 6/8 (75%) patients experienced CMV disease. Two

301

patients with syndrome infection presented a low-grade fever, mild lymphocytopenia and low

302

increased level of alanine aminotransferase (ALT). Among patients with CMV disease,

303

diarrhea, leucopenia, lymphopenia and low impairment in renal function were more

304

frequently observed. One patient had both diarrheas, vomiting and severe abdominal pain

305

without confirmed by tissue-invasive.

306

Interestingly for demographic characteristics, younger patients were significantly

307

associated with CMV disease reactivation (28.8 ± 5.12 vs. 38.1 ± 12.34, P = 0.007) (Table

308

3a). Despite using the dose of all immunosuppressive drugs as thymoglobuline induction,

309

mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus or cyclosporine, no effect was demonstrated on viral

310

disease reactivation.

311

Significant higher peak viral load was also observed for patients with CMV disease

312

compared with those who remained symptoms free (3.8 ± 1.59 vs. 2.4 ± 0.79, P = 0.003).

313

Furthermore, the median duration of viraemia appeared to be also statistically significant for

314

this group 21.2 [1 to 570 days] vs. 13.4 [1 to 42 days], P = 0.028.

315

Symptomatic patients were treated with either intravenous ganciclovir alone or with

316

relay by valacyclovir or valganciclovir. One patient who suffered from serious dysfunction

317

transplant did not receive curative treatment and was treated only with reduction of

318

immunosuppression (MMF). In addition, mycophenolate dose was temporally reduced for all

319

symptomatic patients. On the other hand, five patients without CMV related symptoms but

320

who showed a high viral load were also treated with intravenous ganciclovir and one patient

321

received only oral valaciclovir (Table 3a, 3b). Seventeen asymptomatic patients with low viral

322

load were monitored regularly by real- time PCR without interventions. The median duration

323

of antiviral treatment was 12 [15 to 55] days. However, the duration of CMV therapy was

324

significantly longer in the symptomatic patients than in the asymptomatic recipients (median

325

period = 24.3 days ranging 21- 55 vs. median = 12.3 days ranging 15 - 30, P < 0.001,

326

respectively). Nine cases were suspected of antiviral resistance with persistence of viraemia

327

after three weeks of treatment or increased viral load at time of curative treatment. After

328

achieving viral load clearance, a secondary prophylaxis was given to nine patients who

329

received antiviral therapy (Table 3b). Viral Infections with polyoma BK virus was more

330

observed in this group. Likewise, most patients with symptomatic CMV reactivation showed

331

significantly high proportion of intercurrent infections compared to asymptomatic patients

332

(6/8 (75%) vs. 5/22 (23%), P = 0.028). Furthermore, acute graft rejection was statistically

333

recorded in 4/8 (50% with P = 0.003, Table 3c). In the other hand, 6% of population had

334

recurrent CMV and was seen more frequently among patients who presented syndrome or

335

disease compared to patients without symptoms (62.5% vs 22.7%, P = 0.08).

The incidence of recurrence CMV was 10 (17%) of 60 patients. Recurrence of CMV

363

infection occurred an average of 288.9 ± 206.4 days after transplantation, or appeared after

364

first episode of reactivation at mean 136.2 ± 120.5 days. The duration of recurrence was at

365

median 5.5 days (range 1- 710 days). After discontinuation of antiviral therapy, recurrence

366

was observed at mean time of 158.4 ± 139.7days. Among patients with recurrence, 3/10

367

(30%) had only detectable viraemia and seven of 10 patients (70 %) developed quantifiable

368

viraemia which an average viral load at diagnosis was 2.3 ± 0.8 log10IU/ml. In addition, mean

369

peak viral load of recurrence remained higher than in no recurrent patients (2.7 ± 0.7

370

log10IU/ml). In this study, the most recurrent patients had no clinical symptoms (8/10, 80%).

371

But, two recipients (20%) with symptomatic CMV recurrence presented either with hepatitis,

372

hematuria or diarrhea. All patients with higher viral load were treated with intravenous GCV

373

and carefully monitored until viraemia subsided. Renal function (plasma creatinine and

374

estimated glomerular filtration rate eGFR) and blood white cell counts (leukocyte,

375

polynuclear neutrophils and lymphocyte) measured at 3 and 6 months of follow-up in patients

376

with recurrent infection were similar (Table 4). For baseline characteristics and outcomes of

377

recurrence, no significative differences were observed between patients with or without

378

recurrent CMV infections (Table 4).

Discussion
We found that virus replication after renal transplantation is frequent in seropositive
recipients. Despite prophylaxis, 63% of first episodes reactivation was observed in this group.
This finding was in accordance with data of recent literature, 43 to 61.9% CMV seropositive
transplant patients had experienced virus reactivation or re-infection by detection of viral
DNA [18, 29]. One study [30] demonstrated that transplanted organ of seropositive donor was
associated with 49% infection rates in the recipients with lack of prophylactic treatment. The
other study [15] has reported that if the donor was CMV seropositive, the risk of CMV
reactivation was found to be more than doubled within the first-year post-transplantation.
We postulate that this high rate could indicate the role of seropositive donor who can
play through the recipient’s exposure to new virus strains. A number of previous studies had
suggested that seropositive patients were more likely to be re-infected with new strains than to
have active replication of the latent virus [31]. Otherwise, CMV reactivation could also be
caused by contact with immunocompetent infected individuals after post transplantation
where seroprevalence of CMV reached 96.7% in our population [32].
Nevertheless, others studies reported that kidney transplant recipients were commonly
exposed to the risk of reactivation as they received a high immunosuppression treatment
during the first three months of follow-up [25, 33]. However, in our study, induction therapy
with lymphocyte-deleting agents as ATG (thymoglobulin) did not show a significant
difference compared to basiliximab. Moreover, our data demonstrated that reactivated patients
receiving triple maintenance therapy such as tacrolimus, mycophenolate and steroids did not
reach statistical results.
CMV replication has been known as dynamic process in the human host. Therefore,
the management of CMV levels relies on quantitative analysis of CMV markers. In the

current era, several tests were proposed for detecting and monitoring CMV replication after
solid organ transplantation. However, quantitative real -time PCR is now the standard assay
for measuring viral load with increased sensitivity [16, 34]. In our study, 79 % of reactivated
patients had shown quantitative viral load with a limit detection threshold of 1.49 log10 IU/ml.
The incidence of symptomatic viraemia (13%) among our transplant population was similar
with previous study that included only seropositive kidney transplants [33]. However, our
result seemed to be lower in comparison with Madi’s data which 68.5% of most kidney
recipients had symptomatic infection [35]. We postulate that the different variations observed
between our results and those of others studies could be attributed either to CMV preventions
strategies (universal prophylaxis versus preemptive treatment), or to antiviral drugs used
(valaciclovir versus valganciclovir or ganciclovir), and longer duration of prophylaxis
treatment (six versus three months) for R+ recipients. However, the use of prophylaxis
treatment for D+/R+ group did not spare a subset of patients to be exposed to CMV disease.
Additionally, among the group of symptomatic CMV infection, the mean peak viral
load was greater than in patients with asymptomatic viraemia. This finding was corroborated
by the results of systematic review and meta-analysis [36] which indicated that mean viral
load remained significantly higher in patients with CMV disease [OR 9.3 (95% CI, 4.6-19.3)].
Furthermore, these patients had substantially prolonged viraemia (average 21 versus 13 days,
P= 0.028) to reach viral clearance compared to those with symptoms free. This finding
supported previous study [37], which revealed that high initial viral load was associated with
prolonged time to CMV clearance. According to several studies, the high viral load and rapid
increase in plasma were associated with the occurrence of invasive CMV disease [1, 35, 38].
Advanced age was also considered as the main risk factor of development of
symptomatic infection [9, 39, 40]. However, in our cohort, we found that the young patients
were more likely to have symptomatic viral reactivation (28.75 ± 5.12 vs. 38.09 ± 12.34, p <

0.007). Several authors had suggested that reactivation was more frequent in elderly patients
because they had a weakened immune system exacerbated by immunosuppressive treatment
[18, 41]. Even if our population was composed mainly of young patients, the frequency of
observations related to clinical manifestations does not exclude the possibility of interference
from immunological factors. Indeed, one study (42) demonstrated through the QuantiFERONCMV test regardless of age that patients with low levels of anti-CMV immune cells were
more likely to experience intensive viraemia associated with severe clinical manifestations.
Reasonably, it was impossible for us to explain this situation for our patients due to the lack
of data on immunological parameters such as measurement of specific CMV-antibodies titers
and T- cell lymphocytes.
Regards to clinical consequences of intensity viraemia, gastrointestinal manifestations
were the most common of CMV disease reported in (4/8) 50% of symptomatic patients
associated to laboratory abnormalities such as leucopenia, lymphopenia or elevated
transaminases, and only two recipients (25%) developed CMV syndrome. These
manifestations were observed before discontinuing treatment and without confirmation by
invasive diagnosis. As opposed to previous report, fever was considered the most prevalent
manifestation in such patients [43], however, a largest cohort of kidney transplant recipients
study including 1129 patients from Germany and Finland revealed that gastrointestinal tract
infections were detected in 46% and fever in 27% of patients who exhibited symptomatic
reactivation [23]. Despite the use of prophylactic treatment was not routinely applied to
CMV- kidney seropositive patients, the findings of this cohort study were almost similar to
those of our present study which prophylaxis was extended to 6 months in our group of renal
transplants.
However, in the current study, even with a significant high viral load measured in
some cases, the clinical symptoms were not observed. This result was in accordance with

previous study [35]. The author of this report indicated that 13 patients without CMV -related
clinical consequences showed a high viral load. These discrepancies may be explained by
different factors such as the presence of re-stimulated CMV specific cellular immunity in the
host, limited dissemination of virus, source of reactivated CMV strains and possibly
concomitant reactivation of several strains. Those patients who developed high-level viral
reactivation without evidence of organ invasive disease may be exposed to indirect effects of
CMV. Therefore, it is very important to implement a rigorous viral load monitoring
throughout the post-transplant follow-up [44].
For kidney transplant recipients D+/R+, the use of pre-emptive treatment as preventive
strategies has led to the definition of optimal viral load thresholds in order to initiate treatment
or even predict the occurrence of disease or graft dysfunction. Thus, the majority of studies
have explored several tests of real-time PCR in order to determine the optimal viral thresholds
expressed in different units. In our context, we have also used quantitative PCR for detecting
CMV DNA in plasma according to recommendations of international guideline [14]. But, we
did not establish previously viral load thresholds for defining patients at high risk of CMV
disease for that reason we should performed another specific study taking in account the
baseline risk of the kidney seropositive patients for developing high viral loads. There is
another significant point which we were unable to compare our results of viral loads with
other data of different laboratory tests because there is still variability of measurement
expression in units or copies notwithstanding use of international referenced to standard units
defined by World Health of Organization like our study.
Interestingly, the time of therapeutic treatment was significantly twice longer than that
of asymptomatic patients with only quantitative viraemia 24.3 [15 to 55 ] vs. 12.3 [15 to 30]
days, p < 0.001. Otherwise, we found that the incidence of CMV disease during prophylaxis

was 7/8 (87.5%) and 50% of symptomatic patients had CMV symptoms during the first three
months of prophylactic treatment. Therefore, we also discovered very high rates of
quantifiable viraemia and disease during prophylaxis while other studies did not. Recently,
the transplantation society international CMV consensus group [16] suggested that
valaciclovir can be used as a first line prophylactic drug for both D+/R- and D±/R+. Because,
according to several randomized studies, the use of high dose valaciclovir significantly
reduced the incidence of infection and even the severity of CMV disease [45 – 47]. Recent
study [48] had demonstrated that valaciclovir was significantly effective in the prevention
with reduction of the incidence of CMV infection (9.6% in valaciclovir group vs 67.6% in
control group; p < 0.001). As result, our finding may be explained by the fact that all patients
had received lower dose of valaciclovir varied from 4.5g to 6g /daily instead of 8g/daily as
recommended dose for most of whom were given rATG induction therapy [47]. Another
explanation would be proposed in the context of patient compliance that could affect the
effectiveness of the treatment chosen. Indeed, in the absence of full coverage by the national
health insurance system, patients would be more likely to reduce the number of antiviral
treatments in order to optimize the cost of the antiviral medication despite the fact that it was
associated to lower cost used in prophylaxis treatment [46, 49]. With regard to the use of
valganciclovir as prophylactic treatment, we could not distinguish a significant difference
between the symptomatic and symptom-free groups due to the limited number of patients
receiving this type of antiviral drug. On the other hand, ganciclovir was the main antiviral
agent for curative therapy. However, according to the Transplantation Society International
Consensus group [16], nine cases were seemingly suspected to develop antiviral resistance
during assessment. This observation cannot be valited to explain this phenomenon because
the proportion of cases (9/30, 30%) observed was higher compared to other research data.

Three cases are highly suspected because they showed an extension of treatment beyond six
weeks and one of these patients had shown a viraemia with a persistent high viral load during
the first 570-days episode. The other six cases had reactivated during prophylactic treatment
with valaciclovir in low dose. Such cases are considered to be weakly suspected for
resistance. Thus, a second part of this research will be focused on the analysis of potential
genetic mutations using the sequencing method.
Regarding the indirect CMV outcomes, previous studies demonstrated that CMV
disease is an important risk factor for acute renal allograft rejection [50, 51]. In our study, we
found that the four patients who developed transplant rejection had all a CMV disease (4
(50%) vs. 0%, P = 0.003). CMV disease can cause dysregulation in immune system. This
imbalance in the immune system may increase the risk of transplant rejection. One study [52]
showed that CMV disease can increase the risk of acute kidney transplant rejection, and
factors controlling CMV infection, can reduce episode of acute rejection.
The rate was found higher than in the previously two published studies [47, 53] with
34% and 30%, respectively. Similarly, in another report, the high level of CMV viraemia was
positively associated with acute rejection [OR= 3.27,95%IC = 1.08-9.4, P= 0.039] [54]. But
in our study, the number of events was too small to assess a peak viral load effect on the
occurrence of rejection episode.
Considering other infections than CMV, the occurrence of intercurrent infection was
more frequent in those patients with symptomatic reactivation 6 (75%) vs. 5 (22.7%), P=
0.028. Our finding agreed with Blazquez-Navarro et al [54] who revealed a strong association
between the reactivation of cytomegalovirus and BK virus regardless of the level of viral load
measurement.
Another important finding was that our incidence of recurrence was (33%) in patients
with quantifiable viraemia occurring during the first year after transplantation. Recently, few

studies have reported similar results ranging from 30.5% to 36% [22 – 24]. However, the
appearance of recurrence observed is relatively late in comparison with results of these
previous studies. To further add to this, we were not able to show a clinical or virologic factor
associated with increased risk of recurrence in our small study.
There are several significant limitations to consider. First, our study was conducted
retrospectively with small sample size, which limited to performing more robust statistical
tests to explore a several variables considered as risk factors. According to the
recommendation is not available to include more than one variable per 10 events, we could
not perform multivariate regression models for all factors with P less than 0.2 on univariate
analysis. Second, we investigated in a single hospital center, which may limit a
generalizability of our results. Third, we did not perform specific tests of CMV immune
monitoring; it is possible that cases with high viral load without symptoms may have immune
dysfunction during prophylaxis. Due to the fact that most of our patients were given
valaciclovir as the basis for prophylactic treatment, it has been impossible to make a
comparison with the data from the other studies.
Nevertheless, the important strengths of our study included representative population
of typical kidney seropositive transplant recipient. All measurements of CMV DNAemia were
performed in plasma by the same QNAT technique in the same laboratory and reported in
international standards units. The same standardized protocol of immunosuppression and
different strategies of treatment were adopted for our population of kidney recipients.

Conclusion
There is increasing evidence, in the light of these results, that CMV reactivation
remains serious problem for seropositive transplant recipients who were expected to be on
antiviral prophylaxis. Patients with high level of viraemia may be at an increased risk of

progression to CMV disease and adverse events such as acute rejection. In this sense, to
support current prevention strategies, the use of immunological markers is essential associated
with intensive viral load monitoring within the first year post- transplantation as well as the
investigation of suspected antiviral resistance. Although not specifically examined in our
study, there is also need to determine viral load thresholds at which preemptive therapy must
be initiated for our patient’s populations.
