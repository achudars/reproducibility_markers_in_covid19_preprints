Abstract
Background
From 2006 to 2019, Cochrane reviews could be designated “stable” if they were not
being updated but highly likely to be current. This provides an opportunity to
observe practice in ending systematic reviewing and what is regarded as enough
evidence.
Methods
We identified Cochrane reviews designated stable in 2013 and 2019 and reasons for
this designation. For those with conclusions stated to be so firm that new evidence
is unlikely to change them, we assessed conclusions, strength of evidence ratings,
and recommendations for further research. We assessed the fate of the 2013 stable
reviews. We also estimated usage of formal analytic methods to determine when
there is enough evidence in protocols for Cochrane reviews.
Results
Cochrane reviews were rarely designated stable. In 2019, there were 507 stable
Cochrane reviews (6.6% of 7,645 non-withdrawn reviews). The most common
reasons related to no, little, or infrequent research activity expected (331 of 505;
65.5%). Only 39 reviews were stable because of firm conclusions unlikely to be
changed by new evidence (7.7%), but that declaration was mostly not supported by
judgments made in the review about strength of evidence and implications for
research. Among the 180 reviews stable in 2013, 16 reverted to normal status
(8.9%), with 2 of those changing conclusions because of new studies. Few Cochrane
protocols specified an analytic method for determining when there was enough
evidence to stop updating the review (116 of 2,415; 4.8%).
Conclusion
Cochrane reviews were more likely to end because important future primary
research activity was believed to be unlikely, than because there was enough
evidence. Judgments about the strength of evidence and need for research were
often inconsistent with the declaration that conclusions were unlikely to change.
The inconsistencies underscore the need for reliable analytic methods to support
decision-making about the conclusiveness of evidence.

Background
The question of when there is enough evidence to be certain about effects in health
is a critical one: both premature and overdue certainty can do damage. In 1992,
Antman and colleagues demonstrated that harmful clinical advice and initiation of
redundant clinical trials could continue long past the time a question has been
definitively answered. (1) They argued that keeping on top of trial results with
systematic reviews could help reduce this problem, a point of view reiterated by
Chalmers and Glasziou in a 2009 paper on avoidable research waste. (2)
Systematic reviews involve searching for studies on a question and synthesising the
findings, using explicit formal methods. (3) They can be outdated by subsequent
studies, sometimes quite quickly. (4) Systematic reviews of clinical trials therefore
need to be monitored and updated as long as a critical question about effectiveness
or safety remains. This was made feasible on a large scale by developments in
information technology and publishing, and enabled the establishment of the
Cochrane Collaboration in 1993. (5) The Cochrane Collaboration developed a
reviewer and methodologist community around the production and updating of
systematic reviews, underpinned by a clinical trials register and dissemination
through its own journal, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR). (6,7)
The Cochrane community also developed a range of technical and social
mechanisms, and played an often-pioneering role in establishing and evaluating
scientific methodology. (8)
The Collaboration had an initial goal of continual updating and at least one update a
year, moving to a default update interval of two years in 2000, (9) and dropping the
routine updating expectation by 2019. (10) Attempting to keep up with evidence in
health like this raises a variety of complex issues. (11) Methods for updating
systematic reviews became a widespread concern among systematic reviewers and
users of systematic reviews, as well as an area of study. (3,12–14) At some point,
updating a systematic review can become redundant, but there is a risk in
misjudging this.
In the wake of a mega-trial that overturned the results of a meta-analysis in 1995,
Egger and Smith argued “several medium sized trials of high quality seem necessary
to render results trustworthy”. (15) Pogue and Yusuf developed a method using
optimal information size and cumulative meta-analysis, advocating for its use for
prospective determination and monitoring of what would be enough evidence in
systematic review protocols, just as for clinical trials. (16,17) Egger et al identified
limitations in this method, and it never crossed over into practice. (18,19)
Wetterslev et al built on the Pogue/Yusuf method in 2008, incorporating
consideration of heterogeneity, with a method they called trial sequential analysis
with cumulative meta-analysis. (20–22) Cochrane’s 2019 guidance to reviewers
discourages the use of these methods for updating reviews, unless it is prospectively

included in the protocol and used as a secondary analysis only, or in a prospective
meta-analysis of a defined group of trials. (10) A 2016 consensus report shows that
there is still no well-validated methodology in routine use in systematic reviewing,
however, that can reliably show when we have reached, or passed, the point of
“enough evidence”. (14)
Up until 2006, there were two status options for Cochrane reviews: “normal” (active
reviews, ordinarily with an interval of two years until update was due), and
withdrawn (the review is retracted). In 2006, the Collaboration’s governing body
decided to add a third option, designating a review as “stable”, in the following
software release for Cochrane reviews. (23) This status was codified in the 2008
version of the organisation’s handbook for systematic reviewers, (24) defining a
stable review as one that is no longer updated but “highly likely to maintain its
current relevance for the foreseeable future (measured in years rather than
months)”. This status was to be reviewed periodically, and two uses were specified:
•

“The intervention is superseded (bearing in mind that Cochrane reviews
should be internationally relevant);

•

The conclusion is so certain that the addition of new information will not
change it, and there are no foreseeable adverse effects of the intervention”.

In 2008, the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and
Evaluation (GRADE) Group introduced a categorisation of “high quality” in assessing
the strength of evidence, defined as “Further research is very unlikely to change our
confidence in the estimate of effect”, and this was soon incorporated into Cochrane
review summary of findings tables. (24,25) However, the GRADE Group moved
away from this conceptualisation by 2017, in favour of “high certainty of evidence”.
(26) The GRADE Handbook also recommends using an optimal or required
information size calculation to assess the adequacy of precision of an estimate of
effect, and that was incorporated in the 2019 edition of the Cochrane Handbook.
(10,27)
Cochrane retired the status “stable” in 2019, and a new updating status of “no longer
being updated” adopted, with different criteria for use. (10,28) The pool of
systematic reviews that have carried the designation “stable” provides an
opportunity to study a critical stage in the life cycle of systematic reviews, and when
some systematic reviewers believe there is enough evidence. The aims of this study
were to assess the extent of usage of stable status, review the fate of reviews
designated stable in 2013, and categorise reported reasons for cessation of
systematic review updating. We also aimed to describe the reviews with conclusions
stated to be unlikely to change with results of new studies, and estimate the extent
to which Cochrane reviews were using analytic methods over and above metaanalysis to determine when there was enough evidence.

Methods
Study aim 1: assessing the extent of usage of stable status
The identification numbers of all Cochrane systematic reviews designated as stable
in the March 2012 and February 2013 issues of the CDSR had been identified from
the journal’s encoded version (XML markup language), as well as the number of
non-withdrawn published Cochrane reviews. Each review’s identification number
was recorded, as well as the year it was designated stable according to the published
“What’s New” section of the review.
In 2019, we identified the CDSR reviews designated stable up to 20 August via the
advanced search option in Archie (the internal Cochrane contributors’ database on
Cochrane reviews and other documents). (29,30) Identification number, title, and
status, were collected, as well as the Cochrane Review Group (CRG) responsible for
the review. CRGs are the editorial groups responsible for reviews in specific topic
areas. We also collected two fields related to the review’s updating status
(“rationale” and “explanation”), which had been introduced in a new Updating
Classification System in 2016. (28) Cases where a review had both stable and
retracted (“withdrawn”) status were excluded. Reviews that were stable in 2013
and still described as stable in the CDSR were included in the study, even if they
were not among the reviews declared stable downloaded from Archie.
The total number of Cochrane reviews on 20 August, excluding those that were
withdrawn, was obtained from the Cochrane Editorial Unit. A full listing of the CRGs
in 2019 was compiled from The Cochrane Library website in March 2019. (31) The
reviews of a CRG that no longer exists (HIV/AIDS) were merged with those of the
CRG now responsible for that subject area (Infectious Diseases).
Study aim 2: reviewing the fate of reviews designated stable in 2013
We compared the list of stable reviews from 2013 with those in 2019, identifying
those that were no longer designated stable. Data on the current status of those that
were no longer designated stable were collected from the CDSR, and events reported
in the “What’s New” table since 2013 were summarized by one author (HB). Each
review’s status was categorised as normal, stable, or withdrawn. These cases were
evaluated by both authors.
Study aim 3: categorising reported reasons for cessation of systematic reviewing
In 2012 and 2013, both authors had reviewed the reasons for the designation given
in the “What’s New” section, assigning categories which were developed and agreed
on iteratively. Where reasons were not given in the “What’s New” section, the
abstract, discussion, and conclusion sections were reviewed. Differences in category
assignment were resolved by discussion.

We modified and added to our categories from 2013 when reviews did not fit an
existing category. We also used the information in the unpublished fields for update
classification in Archie to supplement the information published in the reviews for
our categorisation.
We assessed the currency of our 2013 categorisations by checking them against the
unpublished “rationale”. When these matched, we retained our original category
without further review.
Where the internal “rationale” and “explanation” for a review were unambiguously
consistent, and unambiguously matched one of our categories, we assigned that
category and undertook no further analysis, unless it was a review we had
categorised as having a firm conclusion in 2013. All other cases were initially
reviewed by one author (HB), who extracted data on reasons for the designation
from the “What’s New” section of that review on the CDSR and assigned a category
to the review. A random sample of 70 of these were independently assigned a
category by the second author (LGH), and differences were resolved by discussion.
The second author also reviewed all cases assigned as reaching firm conclusions,
and differences were resolved by discussion. Of the final sample of included stable
reviews, 42% were assessed by both authors, 27% by one author (HB), and 31%
were based on Cochrane classifications alone (S5 File).
Study aim 4: describing reviews with firm conclusions unlikely to change with new
studies
To explore this category of reviews, we categorised the main conclusions of these
reviews, resolving differences by discussion. Authors’ judgments in two other parts
of Cochrane reviews are directly relevant to aspects of a firm conclusion, and could
be expected to support the review’s conclusiveness. The first is the authors’
conclusion on the implications of their findings for research, and the other is the
judgment on strength of evidence. We categorised the reviews’ section on
implications for future research, resolving differences by discussion.
In addition, one author (HB) collected the highest GRADE rating for certainty of
evidence in the summary of findings (SoF) table. Where there was no summary of
findings table, the description of evidence quality or certainty in the abstract,
results, or discussion sections of the review was collected. When the only evidence
rating was at the individual study level, the rating for the best-rated study was
collected. To determine whether these reviews reported used specific formal
analytic method in addition to meta-analysis to reach their determination of enough
evidence, the methods, results, and discussion sections were also reviewed by one
author (HB).
Study aim 5: estimating the extent of usage of formal analytic methods to determine

when there is enough evidence in protocols
To estimate the potential usage of analytic methods for analysing whether there is
enough evidence above and beyond meta-analysis, a full text search of all protocols
in CDSR was done for the phrases “trial sequential analysis”, “value of information”,
“optimal information size”, or “required information size” on 29 September 2019.
Protocols were screened by one author (HB) to identify those that included an
analytic method for determining when there would be enough evidence. The
number of protocols in the CDSR was recorded.
Data management and analysis
Data were collected in Excel and analysed using RStudio 1.1463 running R 3.5.2,
(32,33) using tidyverse and reshape2 packages. (34,35) Summary statistics were
used to describe the cohort. Data for this project, including analytic code, are also
deposited at GitHub. (36)
Results
Usage of stable status
We identified 507 reviews classified stable among 7,645 non-withdrawn reviews
(6.6%) in August 2017 (Figure 1, S3 File, S4 File). In February 2013 there had been
180 Cochrane reviews classified stable, which were 3.5% of all 5,137 nonwithdrawn Cochrane reviews.

There was an increase in the proportion of reviews designated stable between 2013
and 2019. This was in large part due to a single Cochrane Review Group (CRG).
Table 1 shows the breakdown of stable reviews across CRGs in 2019, showing that
they are not distributed evenly across the 53 groups and most are designated stable
by a few groups.

The number of stable reviews per CRG ranged from 0 to 219, with a median of 1
(IQR 7). Of the six CRGs responsible for over 20 stable reviews, three CRGs were
responsible for 59.2% of all stable reviews, with a single CRG designating 219
reviews stable (43.2% of all stable reviews).
Fate of reviews designated stable in 2013
Most of the 180 reviews with stable status in 2013 were still designated stable in
2019 (n = 159, 88.3%), but 16 reverted to normal status (8.9%) and five were
withdrawn (2.8%) (Figure 2). One was withdrawn because it was no longer a
priority for the editorial group, and the others were being replaced by one or more
new reviews or protocols.

Most stable reviews that reverted to normal status did not have new included
studies (11 of 16; 68.8%) (Table 2). Two of the reviews had been declared stable in
2013 because of firm conclusions judged unlikely to be changed by new evidence. In
one case, however, it was because new trials had been found and an update of the
review was in progress. In the other, it was because of a reader’s criticism that the
firm conclusion was unjustified.

Reasons for reviews being designated stable
We agreed on eight categories for the reasons reported for declaring reviews stable.
In Figure 3, we summarise these reasons and group them into those with an
alternative schedule for updating, those where updates have ceased, and those
where it appears that updating was never intended.

Figure 3. Categories of reasons reported for stable status of reviews.

Although each category is distinct, they are not mutually exclusive: a review could
be assigned to ongoing monitoring rather than scheduled updating because little
further research is expected, for example. Table 3 shows the proportion of reviews
assigned to each of the eight categories, in order of frequency. For two reviews, no
reasons were reported for declaring the review stable.

The three most common reasons for declaring a review stable all relate to no, little,
or infrequent research activity expected (331 of 505; 65.5%). As such a large
proportion of these reviews were from one CRG, Figure 4 illustrates the proportion
of reviews in each of the eight categories as in Table 2, with and without its reviews.
This suggests that editorial practices were variable between CRGs that applied
stable status.

Reviews with firm conclusions reported to be unlikely to change
There were 39 reviews designated stable with firm conclusions reported to be
unlikely to change with further evidence, which was 0.5% of all 7,645 nonwithdrawn Cochrane reviews in 2019. They came from 11 CRGs, including 16 from
the single CRG with the most stable reviews (41.0%, approximately the same
proportion as the group has for stable reviews overall). Two of the reviews coming
to firm conclusions reported an analytic method for this decision in their methods
(5.1%). In one, it was cumulative meta-analysis, and in the other, it was a sample
size calculation based on data from the larger included trials.
In 20 of the 39 reviews, the firm conclusion was that there was a benefit (51.3%).
The firm conclusion in the 19 others was an absence of evidence of benefit or
superiority, with five of those concluding there was evidence of adverse effect(s)
(12.8%).
The majority of the reviews concluded there were still open questions. The authors
in 20 of the 39 reviews with firm conclusions wrote that further research was
needed on the subject for which their conclusion was firm (59.0%). Of the 16
reviews where authors concluded no further research on that question was needed,
six recommended research on other questions related to the review’s subject (a
further 15.4% of the 39 reviews).
Table 4 shows the evidence rating and future research recommendation for the 14
reviews that had GRADE SoF tables, broken down by the type of firm conclusion.
In those 14 reviews with evidence rated using GRADE, we saw little consistency
between the firm conclusion/stable status, the quality of evidence, and the
recommendation about future research. Only three of the 14 reviews (21.4%) rated
the quality of the evidence as high, with no further research recommended. The
others are not universally contradictory – for example, in one review, the lack of
good evidence of effectiveness was coupled with reference to literature on the
biological implausibility of possible benefit from the intervention. (37) That is
exceptional, however, and the apparent internal contradictions in conclusions were
typically not explained. Some of the discrepancy could be related to conflating the
question of whether a strong enough study will be done, with what the impact of
one would be.

One review with an SoF table did not rate the quality of the evidence.
Defined in the review as “High: further research is very unlikely to change our
confidence in the estimate of effect”.
Defined in the review as “Moderate: further research is likely to have an important
effect on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate”.
Defined in the review as “Low: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the
true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect”.

For the group of 25 reviews without a GRADE SoF table, 12 concluded there was no
need for further research on the subject of their firm conclusion (48.0%). However,
we could not assess the consistency with the firm conclusion and the authors’
judgment of the strength of the evidence. Many reported no overall “rating” of the
quality of the included evidence (14 of 25; 56.0%), and of those that did, there was
no other consistent method for reaching that judgment.
Use of analytic methods for determining the evidence is enough in protocols for
Cochrane reviews
We identified 116 out of 2,415 review protocols that reported some planned use of
one of the formal analytic methods we searched for (Table 5).

The method proposed was mostly trial sequential analysis, and most uses of it came
from the CRG associated with the development of the method that advises its
authors to use it (79 of 107, 73.8%). (38) Each use of optimal information size was
in relation to GRADE assessment.
In all, 19 CRGs in this search had at least one protocol using one of these methods
(35.8% of all CRGs). The range of protocols per CRG was 1 to 79 (median 1, IQR 2).
Discussion
The group of reviews declared stable by Cochrane authors or editorial groups
demonstrate several ways in which a “live” systematic review can reach its end. It
was usually not because there was enough reliable evidence. There were some
relatively common reasons for declaring a Cochrane review stable. One was that the
research focus shifted or the review needed to be split or merged with another or
others. Another was that the clinical question had lapsed because the interventions
involved are no longer available or have been superseded by other forms of care.
However, the overwhelming reason for declaring reviews stable related to the
perceived likelihood of there being further eligible studies. Two-thirds of the
reviews were declared stable because of some variation of infrequent or no research
activity around the intervention(s). This is also a critical factor to others. For
example, for the National Institute for Health and Care Evidence (NICE), not
identifying any major ongoing studies is key to retiring a question. (39)
Low likely research yield is a logical criterion for the use of scarce updating
resources. However, following active research areas only could tilt the systematic
review agenda towards the agendas of those who invest in trials, rather than clinical
and consumer relevance. “Continuing importance of the review question to decision
makers” is explicitly a key consideration about updating in Cochrane guidance. (10)
That goal might be at risk from considering whether there are new studies that
could impact results before deciding to update. The latest issue of the Cochrane

Handbook also recommends considering metrics such as review clicks and citations
in deciding whether or not to update. (10) That may lead in the same direction,
perhaps channeling resources issues of less health value because they can go viral.
This situation becomes critical when the question still concerns consumers and
clinicians and an updated systematic review could have encouraged further studies,
or the judgment about the likelihood of important evidence proves to be wrong. In
our sample, authors of at least 5% of stable reviews reversed their decision between
2013 and 2019, with two of those reviews having changed conclusions because of
new evidence. Although that is reassuringly low, we do not know whether
important new evidence or other developments affected further reviews that did
not search for them.
The 2016 consensus statement on updating systematic reviews (14) argues that
decisions not to update a systematic review need to be made in a context where new
studies are under surveillance, because “… it is still important to assess new studies
that might meet the inclusion criteria. New studies can show unexpected effects (eg,
attenuation of efficacy) or provide new information about the effects seen in
different circumstances (eg, groups of patients or locations)”. The remit of
Cochrane’s review groups includes maintaining a register of trials within their
subject scope, but we do not know the extent to which they all systematically assess
incoming studies.
New studies are not the only development that could affect or compromise a
systematic review’s conclusions and estimates. Identification of major error in an
included study, for example, could reduce the effect size in a meta-analysis, (40) or
could invalidate a review’s conclusions. The 2019 Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions notes studies retracted for data fabrication should be
removed from Cochrane reviews. (10)
The designation “stable” has been replaced in 2019 by the status, “no update
planned”. Given the problems our study shows with the implementation of the
stable status, its end is justified. The replacement status has five options, none of
which cover having enough evidence: (a) the intervention or (b) review is
superseded, (c) the research area is no longer active, (d) the review is of low
priority, and (e) “other”. (28)
“No update planned” is one of three potential statuses from 2019, the others being
“up to date” and “update pending”. These categories aim to “provide readers with a
guide to the status of the Cochrane review, and the likely future plans for the
Cochrane Review with respect to updating”. (28) The usefulness of the “up to date”
categorisation to readers depends on how current and accurate that judgment is.
“Update pending” may be inherently misleading to readers, however. It could mean
an update is around the corner, but it could be a euphemism for “out of date”.

Our study’s results have only limited application to Cochrane’s new system.
Analysing these reviews was useful for charting part of the life cycle of systematic
reviews and exploring some practices, but it had had major limitations in assessing
prevalence of those practices. A substantial number of Cochrane’s editorial groups
never applied the “stable” status, and practices among those that did appears to be
highly variable. The data therefore do not reflect the proportion of Cochrane
reviews to which the status could apply. Reasons for declaring a review stable were
often poorly reported or ambiguously stated. A substantial proportion of our
category assignments were based on internal Cochrane information without
assessing the text of the review, or were made by a single author.
However, several of our findings are relevant for Cochrane reviews and for the
development of methods in systematic reviews generally. We found that judgments
about the conclusiveness of evidence and potential importance of future research to
current findings were often inconsistent within the small group of reviews coming
to firm conclusions. The potential for an error in judgment is high for Cochrane
reviews, (21,41–43) and there can be considerable differences in authors’ GRADEbased assessments in systematic reviews in general. (44) Differing interpretations
at the additional level suggested by this study underscore the value that improved
methodology could offer.
Although the Cochrane Handbook discourages the use of methods such as trial
sequential analysis, (10) value of information and related methods have been
advocated or are in use for determining future research needs based on metaanalysis, (45,46) as well as methods for determining priorities in updating them.
(14,47,48) We found that a small proportion of Cochrane protocols are
incorporating similar methods to determine when updating is no longer required.
Our search terms would not have identified all the protocols using a methodology to
prespecify when a review could be closed.
Optimal information size is now explicitly recommended in the Cochrane Handbook
for considering the imprecision of trial results, (10) and that may be more widely
used in future. The impact of that should be assessed, both for systematic reviewers
and users of reviews. The inconsistencies we identified in this study underscore the
need for reliable analytic methods to support decision-making about the
conclusiveness of evidence. Those decisions include health care choices and
recommendations, as well as conducting, funding, approving, and participating in
clinical trials. Being able to decide when there is enough evidence, with reasonable
reliability, is both a practical and ethical necessity.
