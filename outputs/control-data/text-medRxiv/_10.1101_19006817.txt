Abstract
Introduction: We aim to visualize and analyze the science map of Cochrane systematic reviews with the
high altmetric attention scores. Methods: On 10 May 2019, altmetric data of Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews obtained from Altmetric database (Altmetric LLP, London, UK). Bibliometric data of
top 5% Cochrane systematic reviews further extracted from Web of Science. keyword co-occurrence, coauthorship and co-citation network visualization were then employed using VOSviewer software. Decision
tree and random forest model were used to analyze citations pattern. Results: 12016 Cochrane systematic
reviews with Altmetric attention are found (total mentions=259,968). Twitter was the most popular
altmetric resource among these articles. Consequently, the top 5% (607 articles, mean altmetric score=
171.2, Confidence Level (CL) 95%= 14.4, mean citations= 42.1, CL 95%= 1.3) with the highest Altmetric
score are included in the study. Keyword co-occurrence network visualization showed female, adult and
child as the most accurate keywords respectively. At author level, Helen V Worthington had the greatest
impact on the network. At organization and country levels, University of Oxford and U.K had the greatest
impact on the network in turn. Co-citation network analysis showed that Lancet and Cochrane database
of systematic reviews had the most influence on the network. However, altmetric score do not correlate
with citations (r=0.15) (Figure 7), it does correlate with policy document mentions (r=0.61). Results of
decision tree and random forest model (a machine learning algorithm) confirmed importance of policy
document mentions. Discussion: Despite popularity of Cochrane systematic reviews in Twittersphere,
disappointingly, they rarely shared and discussed in newly emerging academic tools (e.g. F1000 prime,
Publons and PubPeer). Overall, Wikipedia mentions were low among Cochrane systematic reviews,
considering the established partnership between Wikipedia and Cochrane collaboration. Newly emerging
and groundbreaking concepts, e.g. genomic medicine, nanotechnology, artificial intelligence not that
admired among hot topics.
Keywords: Cochrane systematic review, Altmetrics, Science map, Twitter, Facebook, Social media,

Introduction:
Cochrane is a British charity founded in 1993 by Iain Chalmers twisting independent health care
research into data globally. This organization specifically created to manage findings in medical
research to facilitate evidence-based choices in health interventions faced by health
professionals, patients, health policy makers and even people interested in health to make the
informed decisions for improved health. Cochrane includes 53 review groups from 130
countries.1
Altmetrics is a newly emerging academic tool measuring online attention surrounding scientific
research outputs.2,3,4 It acts as a compliment, not replacement for traditional citation-based
metrics.5 Altmetric data resources are including Twitter, Facebook (mentions on public pages
only), Google+, Wikipedia, news stories, scientific blogs, policy documents, patents, postpublication peer reviews (Faculty of 1,000 Prime, PubPeer), Weibo, Reddit, Pinterest, YouTube,
online reference managers (Mendeley and CiteULike) and sites running Stack Exchange (Q&A). 6
In comparison with traditional citation-based metrics, altmetric data resources are very fast.
Bibliometric analysis showed that only 50% of articles are cited either in the first three years after
publication.7 In contrast, several altmetric data resources are updated on a real-time feed (e.g.
Twitter and Wikipedia) or daily-basis (e.g. Facebook).
Research founders and charities, such as the Wellcome Trust and John Templeton Foundation
are paying attention to altmetric analysis.8 A study on the influence of the alcohol industry on
alcohol policy would be a good example.9 This study supported by the Wellcome Trust , which
invests approximately £600 million (US$ 936 million) yearly. Three months following this
publication in PLOS medicine, it remained without citation. Yet, altmetrics allowed the Wellcome
Trust to understand that this article had been tweeted by key influencers, including members of
the European Parliament, international nongovernmental organizations, and a sector manager
for Health, Nutrition, and Population at the World Bank to reveal its global impact on the policy
sphere .8

In the context of growing petition among research community to publicize research findings on
the cyberspace, new terms appeared in scientific literature, e.g. Twitter science stars10 and
Kardashian index (a statistics measuring over/under activity of scientists in Twittersphere).11
Altmetric research however, is a growing field in medical science.12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19 Here we aimed
to visualize and analyze the knowledge structure of Cochrane systematic reviews with the high
altmetric attention scores to discover hot topics and influential researchers and institutions.

Methods:
On 10 May 2019, altmetric data of Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews obtained from
Altmetric database (Altmetric LLP, London, UK). Bibliometric data of top 5% Cochrane systematic
reviews further extracted from Web of Science. keyword co-occurrence, co-authorship and cocitation

(http://www.vosviewer.com/, Centre for Science and Technology Studies, Leiden University).
The Pearson coefficient was also used for the correlation analysis. In this step, citation counts
(according to Dimensions database) and number of Mendeley readers were involved along with
altmetric data. Decision tree and random forest (using conditional Inference Trees) model (a
machine learning algorithm) were used to analyze influential factors on citations pattern.
Generalized linear model was employed to find predictive models. Rattle (graphical user interface
for data science in R) was used for data analysis.20

(Figure 1). Tweets were mainly from U.K (18.8%), Spine (9.8%) and U.S (7.8%).
Consequently, the top 5% (607 articles, mean altmetric score= 171.2, Confidence Level (CL) 95%=
14.4, mean citations= 42.1, CL 95%= 1.3) with the highest Altmetric score are included in the
study. Bibliometric data of the found 552 articles in the Web of Science further analyzed.

“Vitamin C for preventing and treating the common cold” for instance is the Cochrane systematic
review with the highest Altmetric score. This article is in the top 5% of all research outputs scored
by altmetrics (Altmetric score: 587). It was discussed in 54 mainstream news outlets, 3 scientific
blogs, 174 tweets (with an upper bound of 5,126,827 followers, in which 89% were made by
members of the public), 91 Facebook pages, 4 Google+ pages, 1 Wikipedia article, 1 research
highlight platform, 1 video up-loader, used by 754 Mendeley readers and 2 CiteULike users
(www.altmetric.com/details/1229303) (Table 1).
@CochraneUK (4,087 total mentions from this Twitter user) was the most active altmetric
resource followed by Cochrane zdravlje (1,702 total mentions from this Facebook wall) and
@silvervalleydoc (1,662 total mentions from this Twitter user).
Keyword co-occurrence network analysis showed female, adult and child as the most accurate
keywords respectively (Figure 2). At author level, Helen V Worthington (Co-ordinating Editor of
the international Cochrane Oral Health Group) had the greatest impact on the network, as well
as Lee Hooper (Research Synthesis, Nutrition & Hydration at Norwich Medical School) with a
central connection role in the network (Figure 3). At organization and country level, University of
Oxford and U.K had the greatest impact on the network in turn (Figure 4 and 5). Co-citation
network analysis showed that Lancet and Cochrane database of systematic reviews had the most
influence on the network (Figure 6).
However, altmetric score do not correlate with citations (r=0.15) (Figure 7 and 8), it does
correlates with policy document mentions (r=0.61) (Figure 7). Results of decision tree and
random forest model confirmed importance of policy document mentions (Figure 9 and 10).
Considering variables presented in Figure 7, generalized linear regression model can be used as
a predictive model for future Twitter mentions (Pseudo R-Squared=0916) (Figure 11, Appendix
1).

Discussion:
Number of social media users will increase to 3.09 billion by 2021.21 A large-scale survey showed
Twitter plays a key role in the discovery of academic information.22 Nowadays, well-known
academic healthcare providers used social media to communicate with patients and disseminate
trusted medical information;23 @MayoClinic with 1.92 million followers and 47600 tweets for
instance.24
It is widely believed that Cochrane systematic reviews are one of the most important resources
in evidence-based clinical decision making. In this study we intended to analyze social impact of
these reliable medical evidences using altmetrics.8
Overall, analysis of top 5% Cochrane systematic reviews showed high level of Altmetric score
(mean = 171.2). Twitter was the most popular resources, in which tweets were generally from
the U.K. Although Facebook was more popular (2375 million active users) than Twitter (330
million active users) considering the whole community. 25
Popular Cochrane systematic reviews received the acceptable citation rate (mean = 42.1), while
there was no considerable correlation between citations and Altmetric score (r=0.15). Likewise,
there was no significant correlation reported for original research articles published in highimpact general medicine journals,26 Cardiovascular field,27 dentistry

28

Radiology16 and Iranian

medical journals.29 In contrast, in a large-scale survey, the significant correlation was reported
between six altmetric resources (tweets, Facebook wall posts, research highlights, blog mentions,
mainstream media mentions and forum posts) and citation counts.30 Among six PLOS specialized
journals, significant positive correlation reported between the normalized altmetric scores and
normalized citations.31 In the field of general and internal medicine, the number of Twitter
followers is significantly associated with citations and impact factor.32
Despite popularity of Cochrane systematic reviews in Twittersphere, disappointingly, they rarely
shared and discussed in newly emerging academic tools (e.g. F1000 prime, Publons and PubPeer).

Although English medical Wikipedia articles received more than 2.4 billion official visits in 2017,33
Wikipedia mentions among Cochrane systematic reviews was low, considering the stablished
partnership between Wikipedia and Cochrane collaboration 34.
Keyword co-occurrence network analysis showed the newly emerging and groundbreaking
concepts, e.g. genomic medicine, nanotechnology and artificial intelligence in which not that
admired among hot topics.
Helen V Worthington (Co-ordinating Editor of the international Cochrane Oral Health Group) had
the greatest impact on the network based on co-authorship network analysis. Results of PubMed
query Worthington, Hv [Full Author Name] OR Worthington HV [Author] showed 142 Cochrane
systematic reviews, in which Nine of these articles withdrawn. Other influential author, Lee
Hooper (Research Synthesis, Nutrition & Hydration at Norwich Medical School), had three
withdrawn articles among 26 Cochrane systematic reviews. Further examination with the
PubMed query "The Cochrane database of systematic reviews"[Journal] AND WITHDRAWN
[Title] revealed 467 withdrawn Cochrane systematic reviews. Pros and cons of this event are
unclear for authors.
A recent survey showed that journals with their own Twitter account get 34 percent more
citations and 46 percent more tweets than journals without a Twitter account.

35

Of more

interest, Cochrane organization and related groups are well active in Twittersphere, such as
@cochranecollab (83.9K followers and 11.9K Tweets), @CochraneUK (46.6K followers and 31.1K
Tweets), @CochraneLibrary (58.8K followers and 5.9K Tweets), @CochraneCanada (5K followers
and 5.2K Tweets). With respect to the limited number of Cochrane systematic reviews (total
14345 and 670 in 2018), If these several accounts, tweet the same contents regarding outcomes
of reviews? Among 12016 Cochrane systematic reviews included in this study, total citation
number was 506100. With respect to the number of tweets (≈54100) to number of citations
(506100) ratio, it could be estimated that Cochrane is not a Kardashian organization (over active
in Twittersphere).11

Another interesting finding in this study was the correlation between citations and policy
mentions (Figure 7). To our best knowledge, there was no similar report on this subject in the
literature and needs further investigations. It is well-known that "correlation does not imply
causation". Hence, we do more analysis using random forest (a machine learning algorithm) and
conditional decision tree to find influential factors on citations pattern. Results confirmed
importance of policy mentions. Of more interest, scientific blog and Mendeley mentions were
more influential factors than Twitter and Facebook mentions on citations pattern (Figure 9 and
10).
