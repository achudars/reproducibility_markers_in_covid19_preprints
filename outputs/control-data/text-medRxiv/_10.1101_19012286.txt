Abstract
Objective
To determine whether step-downs, which cut the rate of compensation paid to injured workers after

they have been on benefits for several months, incentivise return to work.

Methods
We aggregated administrative claims data from nine Australian workers’ compensation systems to

calculate weekly scheme exit rates, a proxy for return to work. Jurisdictions were further subdivided

into four injury subgroups: fractures, musculoskeletal, mental health, and other trauma. The effect

of step-downs on scheme exit was tested using a regression discontinuity design. Results were

pooled into meta-analyses to calculate combined effects and the proportion of variance attributable

to heterogeneity.

Results
The combined effect of step-downs was a 0.61 percentage point (95% CI -1.16 to -0.05) reduction in

2

the exit rate, with significant heterogeneity between jurisdictions ( I

= 73%, p = .001). Most

significant effects were observed within earliest step-downs, implemented at 13 weeks of benefit

payment. Within injury subgroups, only fractures had a significant combined effect (-0.84, 95% CI -

1.61 to -0.07), and sensitivity analysis suggested a potentially meaningful effect among mental

health claims as well.

Conclusions
The results suggest step-downs prompt an anticipatory effect, meaning some claimants leave

compensation ahead of the step-down to avoid the reduction in benefits. However, the effects were

small and, given their anticipatory nature, probably short-lived. Our findings were statistically

significant, but questions remain about practical significance. We find limited evidence that step-

downs are an effective incentive for return to work.

Key messages
1.

What is already known about this subject?

A number of workers’ compensation systems around the world reduce payments to injured workers

after they have been in the system for several months, though there is little evidence on their

efficacy as a return to work incentive. In Australia, each of the nine major workers’ compensation

systems implements step-downs, offering a unique opportunity to test the effect on scheme exit

rate, a proxy for return to work.

2.

What are the new findings?

Exit rates increased in advance of step-downs, suggesting an anticipatory effect. However, the effect

was small, increasing by less than two-thirds of a percentage point on average, and was mainly

observed where step-downs occurred earlier.

3.

How might this impact on policy or clinical practice in the foreseeable future?

The effect of step-downs on scheme exit is small and probably short-lived, suggesting they provide

little incentive to return to work. Workers’ compensation systems may need to reconsider step-

downs as a component of scheme design, or justify them as a cost-saving measure rather than an

effective incentive return to work.

Introduction
A number of workers’ compensation systems around the world “step-down” income replacement

payments to injured workers after they have been on benefits for several months. These include

several in Europe (Andorra, Croatia, Slovakia, Sweden), Africa (Ethiopia, Republic of Congo, São

Tomé and Príncipe, Zimbabwe), Asia (Indonesia, Laos, Singapore, Taiwan), Central America (Belize,

Panama), the Middle East (Kuwait, Oman, Qatar), South America (Ecuador),

contrasts with original objective of step-downs when introduced across Australia in the 1980s and

90s, which was to reign in the rising costs of employers’ insurance premiums.

Nevertheless,

evidence that more generous benefits increase time off work indicates that step-downs could

plausibly incentivise return to work.

In this study we test whether step-downs increase the rate at which injured workers exit workers’

compensation, and examine effects by type of injury.

Methods
Study questions and analyses were pre-registered with the Open Science Framework.

We

reproduce the analytical approach here and note any deviations.

Step-downs in Australia
Each of Australia’s six states, two territories, and the Commonwealth government have their own

benefits system for injured workers that cover 94% of the workforce.

11

Each scheme is cause-based,

meaning benefits are contingent on attribution of the injury to employment. However, the specific

policies vary considerably, including whether the scheme allows common law claims, whether it is

publicly or privately underwritten, and generosity of benefits.

3

All have step-downs, which also vary

in both timing and magnitude, as illustrated in Table 1.

In addition to income replacement rates, most schemes have wage replacement caps that set a

nominal maximum on what an injured worker may earn, while a few have minimums. Industrial

agreements and number of dependents may also influence the magnitude of step-downs. In

Queensland, claimants with an industrial agreement are initially compensated at the greater of 85%

their Normal Weekly Earnings (NWE, based on the injured workers’ earnings) or the industrial

instrument. At 26 weeks, they step-down to the greater of 75% NWE or 70% Queensland Ordinary

Time Earnings (QOTE, based on state mean earnings). Claimants not under an industrial instrument

are initially compensated at the greater of 85% NWE or 80% QOTE, and step-down to the greater of

75% NWE or 70% QOTE. In the Northern Territory, step-downs are the greater of 1) 75% of weekly

earnings up to a maximum nominal cap, or 2) the lesser of a flat rate plus additional income for each

dependent or 90% of NWE. Step-down rates in Tasmania and Comcare are higher if the claimant is

back at work in some form of partial capacity.

12

In these cases, the magnitude of initial and step-

down compensation rates varied, though timings remained the same.

3

There are a number of other variations

we are unable to account for. In Western Australia,

claimants with an industrial agreement are not subject to step-downs and are compensated at 100%

throughout the life of the claim.

12

In Victoria and to a lesser extent New South Wales, claimants from

unionised industries often have industrial awards and enterprise agreements that top up payments

and can make up any gaps between pre-injury earnings compensation.

calculations.

For some cases, this would mean step-downs applied earlier than specified in our

analyses.

Analysis
We calculated scheme exit rate, a proxy for return to work, by dividing the number of claims exiting

the system each week by the number of claims in the system at the start of that week. Injury

subgroups included fractures, mental health, musculoskeletal, and other trauma. Our pre-registered

categorisation separated back and neck from other musculoskeletal conditions, though we have

since decided to keep them together as a better conceptual fit. Neurological conditions and all other

conditions were excluded due to low numbers.

Data were left-censored at four weeks to exclude residual effects of employer excess, which are the

post-injury periods for which employers pay compensation. Anecdotal reports suggest claims are

less likely to persist only a day or two beyond the employer excess period, tending either to resolve

before the employer excess period ends, or to persist for a few days beyond that. In Australia, the

longest employer excess periods are 10 working days/two weeks in Victoria/South Australia.

that four weeks, while arbitrary, would be sufficient to remove any confounding

due to this effect. Exit rates were calculated up to two years, or 104 weeks.

Effects were evaluated with a regression discontinuity design, a powerful quasi-experimental

approach that compares outcomes on either side of an arbitrary cut-off.

15,16

We used a parametric

polynomial estimator to account for non-linear patterns in exit rates, testing up to 10 polynomial

and selected best-fit models

Initially, we tested only separate slopes, but in several

cases fitted lines noticeably diverged from data points near the step-down cut-off. Testing same-

slope models as well addressed these issues.

Results are reported as the percentage point change to the exit rate. Coefficients and standard

errors were combined into random effects meta-analyses to determine combined effects and the

proportion of variance attributable to heterogeneity.

Exit rates in small groups became unstable as the number of claims in the system diminished over

time. We excluded data points where the number of remaining injured workers for the week was

<500, and did not conduct analyses where there were <20 aggregated data points after the step-

down. These exclusions were an

Step-down impact on scheme exit rates
Across jurisdictions, the combined effect of step-downs on exit rates was a reduction of 0.61-

percentage points (95% CI: -1.16 to -0.05). A significant and moderate proportion of the variance in

effects was attributable to heterogeneity between jurisdictions ( I

= 73%, p = .001).

Within individual schemes, all significant effects were negative. Three of four significant effects were

observed in jurisdictions with the earliest step-downs, occurring at 13 weeks: New South Wales (-

1.65, -3.25 to -0.06), Western Australia (-1.65, -3.07 to -0.23), and South Australia (-2.24, -3.38 to -

1.10). Victoria also had a 13-week step-down, though the effect was non-significant (0.03, -0.88 to

0.95). The only significant effect outside of 13 weeks was in Comcare, where step-downs occur at 45

weeks (-1.24, -2.20 to -0.28). Results are summarised in Figure 1, and regression discontinuities are

plotted in Figure 2.

Step-down impact by injury type – sensitivity analysis
While combined effects were non-significant in mental health, musculoskeletal, and other trauma

claims, magnitudes were similar to fractures claims. There were also indications that a single

jurisdiction was responsible for attenuation to non-significance in some injuries, such as the unique

positive effect among musculoskeletal conditions in the Northern Territory (1.00, 0.04 to 1.96). We

conducted “leave one out” sensitivity analyses,

18

which tested the effect of dropping each

jurisdiction from combined results. Excluding Comcare from the mental health claims meta-analysis

resulted in a significant effect (-1.70, -3.40 to 0.00), though musculoskeletal and other trauma claims

remained non-significant. The results are presented in Supplementary Figure 5.

Discussion
Interpretations of step-down effects on scheme exit rates
The local effect of step-downs on scheme exit rates was negative. The first potential explanation is

that step-downs reduce the likelihood of return to work. This seems implausible given its lack of

theoretical coherence and evidence that greater benefit generosity is positively associated with

claim duration.

19,20

The second interpretation is that there is an anticipatory effect, where claimants

leave compensation system early avoid reductions in income. For illustration, regression

discontinuity plots indicate that where effects are significant, scheme exits increase in just the week

prior to step-down.

A third explanation posits that scheme exit actually increases after step-downs take effect, but we

mis-specified step-downs as occurring later in the process due to discrepancies in step-down

determinations between our data and the various systems. In most cases, divergent estimates would

be attributable to failed return to work attempts and graduated/partial working arrangements. We

think this third explanation is unlikely for several reasons. First, such claimants have demonstrated

positive action to return to work and financial incentives may not provide a sufficient motivation to

achieve sustained return to work. Second, claimants with graduated/partial working arrangements

are less affected by step-downs since only the compensated portion of their wages are reduced.

Tasmania and Comcare even pay higher step-down rates for claimants with partial working

arrangements. Third, we would expect such exits to be more evenly distributed in the pre-injury

period. Instead, plotted results indicate an increase in scheme exits in the week prior to step-downs

that deviates from the secular trend, which suggests these claimants are maximising payments

under the higher initial compensation rate.

Our analytical approach – the regression discontinuity design – only tests on local effects, i.e., at the

cut-off. Evidence that greater benefit generosity increases time off work

19,20

suggests step-downs

may still have longer-term effects, even where there are no local effects. Plotted exit rate patterns

generally indicate continuing logarithmic decay, particularly where local effects were non-significant.

While this does not rule out longer-term effects, it suggests that at most they are small.

Heterogeneity of effects and potential causes
A moderate proportion of the variance in effects across jurisdictions was attributable to

heterogeneity. While we lacked sufficient data to conduct a meta-regression to identify significant

moderators, there was a noticeable association between timing of step-downs and their impact. In

jurisdiction-level analysis, most significant effects were among step-downs occurring at 13 weeks,

15

the earliest timing. This aligns with employer and policymaker opinion that delaying step-downs

diminishes their effectiveness.

4,5

However, the 45-week Comcare step-down, the latest tested in this

study, had a significant effect. This suggests unmeasured factors such as the presence of organised

unions, who may advise claimants on changes to their compensation payments, modify step-down

effects, regardless of timing.

Potential confounders
One challenge to the anticipatory effect explanation is potential confounders that coincide with

step-downs, like incentives that encourage employers and insurers to keep claim durations below a

set threshold. In New South Wales, employers can get a 10% discount on insurance premiums if they

return claimants to work within 13 weeks.

the rate of claims reaching 13 weeks low.

21

22

In Victoria, claims agents receive bonuses for keeping

In both cases, the timing coincided with step-downs, and

there were significant effects: New South Wales overall and for other trauma conditions, Victoria

only for fracture and mental health conditions. We were unable to identify similar incentives in

other jurisdictions.

In presenting these findings, return to work professionals have offered addition explanations that

involve anticipatory effects but do not result in return to work. Rather, at the end of the pre step-

down period, some claimants lodge a new claim with the intention of avoiding the reduction in

payments. Unfortunately, our data to not allow us to link claims across individual claimants and we

are unable to test this explanation.

Effects by type of injury
There were significant combined effects in fractures claims, and more tenuous evidence for an effect

in mental health claims. Fractures are generally considered less responsive to benefit generosity

since they are more visible, easier to diagnose,

20

and have less variability in recovery time.

23

In other

words, there is less discretionary time off work that may be influenced by benefits. Though contrary

to expectations, the findings were not unprecedented. We previously found time off work among

fracture claims sharply increased after Victoria increased maximum wage replacement cap from 150%

to 200% of average state earnings.

19

This may be explained by the subset of fracture claims exposed

to step-downs. Regression discontinuity plots (Supplementary Figure 1) illustrate that unlike other

injuries, exit rates for fracture claims peak around two months post-claim, possibly reflecting the

natural course of recovery.

23

Claims exceeding this peak will be more complex on average, and may

be more sensitive to benefit generosity.

sensitivity to benefit generosity. To our knowledge, our previous work is the only empirical

investigation of how such claims respond to an increase in compensation, in which we found no

19

evidence of an effect.

However, the previous study examined the effect of initial rates of

compensation, while we measure the effect of a change in those rates. The psychological

vulnerability of mental health claimants may mean the act of cutting benefits has a greater effect

than variations in what they are paid from the start.

We were surprised to find the combined effect of step-downs on musculoskeletal conditions was

non-significant, as it contrasts with previous research on these less visible, harder to diagnose

20

conditions.

However, this does not mean there was no effect, only that we were unable to detect

one.

Statistical versus practical significance of findings
While the findings were statistically significant, practical significance is less clear. For one, effects

were fairly small. At the state level, the largest effect was -2.24 in South Australia. At injury level, the

biggest effect was -5.28 among mental health claims in South Australia, though this and the other

larger injury effect estimates had wide confidence intervals and were gathered from 25 subgroup

analyses, making point estimates unreliable. Nevertheless, if these are reflective of the maximum

potential impact of step-downs, they remain marginal. And if they are indeed anticipatory, the

effects may be short-lived, with scheme exit rates returning to normal shortly after step-downs

apply.

Step-downs may negative side effects. They have been linked to financial strain,

worsen outcomes or even delay scheme exit, particularly later in the process.

which could

Economically-

motivated return to work, such as that driven by compensation benefits, can increase the likelihood

of reinjury.

26

Scheme exit does not necessarily entail return to work and may result in cost-shifting to other

income replacement systems.

7,27

However, it seems unlikely that those who leave workers’

compensation in response to step-downs would go elsewhere if the causal mechanism is financial

pressure. Other government-provided incapacity benefits are less generous than workers’

compensation.

3,28

Some claimants may have retired as this option generally entails less financial

stress than other options.

29

However, these inferences assume an informed, calculated, and rational

economic response to financial incentives. The cut in benefits may induce a negative psychological

reaction in some claimants and lead to a scheme exit that is neither return to work nor an

alternative that improves financial well-being.

Meta-analyses suggested there was a moderate amount of heterogeneity between jurisdictions,

which makes it difficult to assess generalisability of results. However, the effects varied from small to

approximately null. The findings may be applicable to similarly cause-based, devolved workers’

compensation systems in developed economies like Canada and the United States. They may also

apply to other disability-based systems in developed countries, though it is unclear what the effects

may be in underdeveloped settings.

Strengths and limitations
This study has several limitations, some we have already mentioned: confounding incentives for

employers and insurers to shorten time off work, discrepancies in determination of step-downs, and

inconsistent application of step-downs for some claimants. Regression discontinuity designs assume

populations around the cut-off are unable to manipulate what condition they are exposed to.

15

Our

study inverted this assumption, since claimants were reacting to the step-down cut-off rather than

being allocated by it to separate conditions. The theoretical implications are unclear, though there

may have been some crossover bias, or mixture of both anticipatory and reactive responses that

biased the results towards null.

Nevertheless, this study had several strengths. We applied a robust quasi-experimental approach,

the regression discontinuity design, to national workers’ compensation data with population-level

coverage. There were sufficient data to investigate impact by jurisdiction and most injury subgroups,

and meta-analysis increased precision of estimates and provided evidence that effects varied by

jurisdiction.

Conclusions
Claimants leave workers’ compensation in anticipation of step-downs, though the effects are small

and probably short-lived. Step-downs may still reduce costs to the workers’ compensation, which is

a legitimate policy goal, though our findings suggest step-downs have a limited effect on return to

work.
