Abstract
There is increasing interest in the development of new, ‘universal’ influenza vaccines (UIV)
that - unlike current vaccines - are effective against a broad range of seasonal influenza
strains, as well as against novel pandemic viruses. Even where these vaccines do not block
infection, they can moderate clinical severity, reducing morbidity and mortality while
potentially also reducing opportunities for transmission. Previous modelling studies have
illustrated the potential epidemiological benefits of UIVs, including their potential to
mitigate pandemic burden. However, these new vaccines could shape population immunity
in complex ways. Here, using mathematical models of influenza transmission, we illustrate
two types of unintended consequences that could arise from their future deployment. First,
by reducing the amount of infection-induced immunity in a population without fully
replacing it, a seasonal UIV programme may permit larger pandemics than in the absence of
vaccination. Second, the more successful a future UIV programme is in reducing
transmission of seasonal influenza, the more vulnerable the population could become to the
emergence of a vaccine-escape variant. These risks could be mitigated by optimal
deployment of any future UIV vaccine: namely, the use of a combined vaccine formulation
(incorporating conventional as well as multiple universal antigenic targets), and by achieving
sufficient population coverage to compensate for reductions in infection-induced immunity.
As early candidates of UIVs approach advanced clinical trials, there is a need to monitor
their characteristics in such a way that is focused on their potential impact. This work offers
a first step in this direction.

Introduction

considerable impact in averting mortality, particularly in risk groups such as the elderly, and

5

may also have contributed towards reducing opportunities for transmission 2–4. Current

6

‘strain-matched’ vaccines raise immunity to the viral surface protein haemagglutinin (HA),

7

particularly its immunodominant ‘head’ region 5. This immunity can be effective as long as it

8

is closely matched with circulating influenza strains. Inactivated influenza vaccines typically

9

have a ‘vaccine efficacy’ (measured using the relative risk of influenza illness amongst

Vaccination has been a mainstay of influenza control since the 1940s 1. It has had

10

vaccinated vs non-vaccinated individuals) of around 60% 6. Recent years have also seen the

11

deployment of live attenuated influenza vaccines 7, which – along with the

12

immunodominant HA – may also raise immunity to additional viral antigens, by permitting

13

limited rounds of replication within immunised hosts. However, there have been recent

14

drops in live vaccine efficacy in the USA 8. Such changes may have arisen from poor HA

15

matching between circulating and immunising strains, from a failure of the attenuated virus

16

to replicate at the site of immunisation, or from a build-up of vaccine-derived immunity in

17

target age groups 9.

18
19

The HA head is the most variable viral component, showing ongoing change in the human

20

population over time as a result of population immunity 10. As a result current influenza

21

vaccines have to be updated regularly, to remain effective in the face of viral evolution 11.

22

Moreover, they are of limited use in the event of a pandemic (the emergence of a

23

transmissible, antigenically novel, influenza virus in the human population). Pandemics are

24

notoriously unpredictable in their timing, as well as in the HA subtype involved. Because of

25

their long development time, current, strain-matched vaccines are of limited use in

26

mitigating against these risks 12.

27
28

In light of these challenges, there has been increasing interest in new vaccines that can

29

focus ‘cross-protective’ immunity against alternative viral components, that may be more

30

conserved across HA strains and subtypes, and more constrained than HA, in their capacity

31

for antigenic evolution 11,12. Some potential vaccine targets are listed in table 1. Candidates

32

include the ‘stem’ region of the HA protein 13, which is more conserved than the variable

33

‘head’ region, as well as proteins inducing T-cell immunity 14, including matrix structural

34

proteins (M1, M2) and viral nucleoprotein (NP). Recombinant and viral vector technology

35

allows the formulation of vaccines that focus immunity on conserved antigenic targets,

36

bypassing the immunodominant HA head region altogether. Several such ‘universal’

37

influenza vaccines (UIVs) are currently in development 15; they may offer qualitatively new

opportunities for influenza control, raising the prospect of routine vaccine programmes that

2

do not need to be updated as often, while also promoting immunity in the population that

3

would protect against a novel pandemic virus.

4
5

Different vaccine formulations also offer different types of immune protection, for example

6

with HA-based vaccines providing ‘sterilising’ protection, that can halt infection in its early

7

stages 16. By contrast, vaccines based on T-cell antigens require some viral replication to

8

occur, in order for these antigens to be processed and made available for immune

9

recognition 17. Such vaccines thus do not offer sterilising immunity, but instead can

10

moderate the clinical course of infection, potentially also reducing onward transmission 18.

11

Table 1 summarises some examples of antigenic targets against influenza, and their

12

potential use in vaccine formulations.

13
14

Previous evidence from disease-dynamic models illustrated the possible population benefits

15

of mass deployment of UIVs, for example that such vaccines could mitigate the impact of

16

novel pandemic viruses. Moreover, over several years, modelling illustrated how sustained

17

vaccination with UIVs could slow the HA evolution of seasonal influenza, by simultaneously

18

suppressing the generation of, and selection pressure for, new antigenic variants 19.

19

Nonetheless, these studies had two main limitations: first, they were not specific to a

20

particular epidemiological setting, aiming instead to illustrate underlying dynamics in a

21

parsimonious but generalisable way. Second, they did not aim to capture immune

22

complexities in the population, nor how these might be shaped by a UIV.

23
24

However, population immunity to influenza is complex and incompletely understood, raising

25

the possibility of unintended consequences from mass vaccination with UIVs. For example,

26

despite the antigenic novelty associated with pandemic viruses, recent work showed that

27

pre-existing T-cells to CD8 epitopes could nonetheless moderate the clinical severity of

28

disease 7. In the present work we aim to examine the epidemiological implications of these

29

dynamics. We address the questions: could a UIV programme affect influenza transmission

30

in adverse ways? How might these risks be mitigated, and what are the critical vaccine

31

characteristics that would need to be monitored to do so?

32
33

We use simple mathematical models of influenza immunity and transmission, focusing on

34

the USA, which currently has the world’s largest coverage of seasonal influenza vaccination

35

captured vaccine efficacy and epidemiological impact of existing influenza vaccination

. A key advantage of this setting is that we are able to build on previous work 21, that

efforts in the USA, over the last decade: we adopt these calibrated models to project the

2

potential impact of UIVs in this setting. We note that the aim of the present study is to

3

identify potential scenarios rather than to make accurate quantitative predictions. We use

4

simple models to draw attention to: (i) examples of immunological and epidemiological

5

dynamics that could result in adverse effects of UIV programmes, and (ii) how these effects

6

might be overcome. In setting out these hypothetical scenarios, this work is also a first step

7

in identifying the key uncertainties that need to be addressed in the course of vaccine

8

development, in order to mitigate the potential for unintended consequences.

Results

11
12

We build on a model previously developed to capture the impact of seasonal influenza

13

vaccination in the USA 21 (see Methods and materials). The model incorporates two types of

14

immunity: (i) HA-specific immunity, which reduces susceptibility to infection. Acquired

15

either through past exposure to infection or through effective strain-matched vaccination.

16

(ii) Cross-protective immunity, assumed to be independent of HA-specific immunity, and

17

likewise acquired either through past infection or through a UIV. We assume that this

18

immunity is heterosubtypic: that is, offering protection across different subtypes. Moreover,

19

we assume that cross-protective immunity does not affect susceptibility to infection, but

20

rather limits viral load during the course of infection, thus reducing infectiousness. This

21

would be consistent, for example, with a UIV targeting T-cell antigens 22; however, we note

22

that HA-stem antibodies would be expected to offer some protection against infection 23,24

23

(Table 1).

24
25

Wide deployment of an effective UIV could allow sustained control of epidemic influenza

26

without need for being updated as frequently as current vaccines. Figure 1 shows the series

27

of influenza seasons in the USA initially modelled in ref. 21, illustrating the epidemic sizes

28

that would have occurred if each dose of strain-matched vaccine had been replaced by a

29

dose of UIV (i.e. with identical vaccination coverage). Dots show the minimum levels of

30

vaccine efficacy that are needed, for a UIV to achieve smaller epidemic sizes than those that

31

resulted from the strain-matched vaccination programme (for UIVs, we denote ‘efficacy’ as

32

the percentage drop in transmission potential arising from vaccination). These minimum

33

levels of UIV efficacy are consistent with levels of VE that are reported in practice, for strain-

34

matched vaccines. Importantly for influenza, the basic reproduction number (R0) is typically

35

only 1 – 2 25. It is therefore possible, even for a vaccine with only modest effectiveness, to

36

have a substantial impact on influenza transmission at sufficiently high coverage 19.

1

Moreover, notably in the case of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it was not possible to deploy

2

appropriate conventional vaccines sufficiently early to mitigate the pandemic. In this case

3

the timely deployment of even a modestly effective cross-protective vaccine could avert

4

millions of cases.

5
6

Having illustrated these potential benefits of a UIV, we now explore their potential adverse

7

effects. We focus on the implications of routine seasonal vaccination with a UIV. In

8

particular, we perform the analysis illustrated schematically in Figure 2: we simulate a

9

population that is subject to seasonal UIV vaccination, and subsequently exposed to a

10

2012/13-like season. Tracking population immunity following these combined immunisation

11

events (the routine UIV programme and the seasonal epidemic), we then assess the

12

vulnerability of the population to different types of subsequent immune escape.

13
14

We begin by examining pandemic emergence. First, we focus on how the routine seasonal

15

UIV programme illustrated in Figure 2 may affect pandemic emergence: we assume there is

16

no supplementary UIV programme mounted in direct response to the pandemic. Figure 3

17

shows one illustrative scenario, where a pandemic virus emerges soon after the 2012/13-

18

like season. The figure suggests that, at low levels of coverage, a seasonal UIV programme

19

may in fact increase the pandemic size. Figure 3B illustrates why: by bringing down seasonal

20

incidence, the UIV programme reduces opportunities for individuals to acquire infection-

21

induced immunity. As a result, there is an expanded pool of individuals who have neither

22

been vaccinated nor infected, and who are thus vulnerable to the emergence of a pandemic

23

virus. As discussed below, this result is analogous to previous work 26, that showed how

24

vaccination in individuals could reduce opportunities for those individuals to acquire broadly

25

protective immunity; Figure 3A illustrates how such a phenomenon could arise at the

26

population level. However, the figure also illustrates that it is possible to overcome this

27

population effect if a seasonal UIV programme has sufficient coverage. In particular, a UIV

28

having 80% efficacy and at 75% coverage would not only interrupt transmission for the

29

2012/13-like season, but would also result in a mitigated pandemic, relative to the absence

30

of vaccination.

31
32

In Figure 3C we relax the assumption of no pre-pandemic vaccination. Taking as an example

33

the case of UIV efficacy of 80% (that is, corresponding to the ‘leading edge’ of the surface in

34

Figure 3A), Figure 3C illustrates pandemic outcomes under different scenarios for pre-

35

pandemic UIV coverage. Overall, if seasonal UIV programmes can increase a population’s

36

vulnerability to new pandemic viruses, panels B, C illustrate two ways in which it is possible

1

to counteract this effect: either with sufficiently high vaccination coverage in seasonal UIV

2

programmes, as noted above (point B), or in pre-pandemic UIV programmes (panel C).

3
4

We next examine the emergence of a seasonal virus that is a UIV escape variant: that is, a

5

virus showing vaccine escape to all UIV antigenic targets, but not against strain-defining

6

epitopes in the HA head. Owing to the plasticity of HA, such a scenario may be applicable to

7

anti-HA1 and anti-HA2 antibodies (see Table 1). Overall, although conserved antigens

8

typically face functional constraints that are thought to limit their diversity 27, the new

9

selection pressures raised by UIVs could, in principle, promote the emergence of immune

10

escape amongst UIV targets. Figure 4 shows the scenario where a 2012/13-like epidemic is

11

followed by a season caused by a UIV escape variant. The figure shows two scenarios: where

12

routine vaccination is conducted using strain-matched vaccines (panel A), and where it is

13

instead conducted using a UIV (panel B). Under the first scenario, the two epidemics are of

14

comparable size. Under the second scenario, although the UIV succeeds in controlling the

15

initial epidemic, it does so at the expense of strain-specific immunity. As a result the

16

subsequent season, associated with a UIV-escape mutant, is considerably larger than it

17

otherwise would have been (the latter indicated by the dashed, horizontal lines for

18

comparison). As discussed below, such risks could be mitigated by a combined vaccination

19

strategy.

20
21

Discussion

22
23

Population immunity makes for a complex and dynamic immune landscape. These

24

intricacies are only increased by the different types of immunity in effect: on the one hand,

25

transmission-blocking immunity that is focused against specific antibody targets, and on the

26

other, more broadly acting immunity that may only be partially transmission-blocking,

27

allowing complex immune dynamics. By focusing on specific types of immunity over others,

28

a vaccination programme may shift the landscape of population immunity in unexpected

29

ways, particularly in settings such as the USA, where routine coverage already exceeds 40%

30

of the population 20. With the prospect of new vaccination programmes that could induce

31

strong indirect protection (i.e. through reducing opportunities for transmission), it is

32

important to anticipate potential adverse effects, and how to overcome them. Here we

33

have illustrated two potential risks, corresponding respectively to the effects of

34

compromising cross-protective immunity (Figure 3) and of compromising strain-specific

35

immunity (Figure 4).

1

First, owing to the nonlinear dynamics of influenza transmission, at low coverages in routine

2

seasonal vaccination, a UIV could in principle control seasonal epidemics, without fully

3

compensating (at the population level) for the reduced opportunities for individuals to gain

4

infection-induced immunity (Figure 3). Doing so would leave the population more

5

vulnerable to a pandemic. Indeed, a similar effect has been proposed in the context of

6

conventional vaccines: namely, that such vaccines could – by neutralising, strain-matched

7

immunity – reduce opportunities for individuals to acquire cross-protective immunity

8

through infection 26. Such effects also arise through the direct protection afforded by strain-

9

matched vaccines; here we demonstrate ways in they could even arise indirectly (i.e.

10

through reducing transmission) at the population level. They could, therefore, adversely

11

affect those who have not received the vaccine.

12
13

Second, by controlling seasonal epidemics, seasonal UIV programmes may also compromise

14

strain-specific immunity in the population: this becomes a concern in the context of viable,

15

transmissible escape mutants to cross-protective immunity. Despite strong arguments for

16

why certain immune targets may face functional constraints preventing them from

17

expressing significant variation 27,28, the possibility of escape cannot be fully discounted 29.

18

Nonetheless, a vaccine formulation combining several different antigens may well greatly

19

reduce the risk of vaccine escape.

20
21

We also note that these risks could be mitigated to some extent, by adequate planning of a

22

future vaccination programme: for example, Figure 3A suggests that a routine UIV

23

programme could indeed protect against pandemics (i.e. reduce the pandemic size) if it has

24

a sufficiently high coverage, to overcome the loss of infection-induced immunity. Figure 3A

25

suggests a minimum coverage of 75%. This threshold is substantially greater than the

26

standard ‘critical vaccination threshold’ required to interrupt transmission of seasonal

27

influenza (points A and B in Figure 3) although, in practice, will depend on several factors

28

including the relative strength and duration of immunity imparted by vaccination versus

29

infection. Likewise in the case of compromising strain-specific immunity, the risks arising

30

from a seasonal UIV programme would be limited by an approach that deploys

31

conventional, strain-matched vaccines in parallel with UIVs. Overall, such an approach – for

32

example, through a combined formulation – could mitigate strongly against the risk of

33

vaccine escape, to either type of vaccine.

34
35

As with any modelling study, our framework has some limitations to note: first, we adopted

36

a highly simplified representation of influenza immunity. We ignored any potential

1

interactions between strain-specific and cross-protective immunity, for example the fact

2

that B-cells can promote the cellular immune response, and vice versa 30,31. With improved

3

data on the implications of these mechanisms for transmission, future work should explore

4

these interactions more closely, to examine their implications for vaccine development.

5

Additionally, for simplicity we assumed that cross-protective immunity is short-lived, and

6

does not persist between seasons. To some extent this was necessitated by the data

7

available, which does not allow us to estimate separately the roles of these two different

8

arms of immunity. However, the duration of cross-protective immunity elicited by

9

immunisation will be an important characteristic of future UIVs 32. There is a need for

10

systematic studies to quantify this duration by monitoring cross-protective immunity over

11

several years. For simplicity we assumed vaccine- and infection-induced immunity to be

12

identical. An important question for future work is the implication of vaccine-induced

13

immunity that is inferior to infection-induced immunity: how should future vaccination

14

programmes compensate for any such shortfalls? What aspects of immune protection

15

(strength, breadth, duration, etc) are most important to address? To inform such analysis,

16

cohort studies of individuals with different exposure and vaccination history would be

17

invaluable.

18
19

We also ignored long-term immune dynamics that could shape protection decades after

20

exposure: two important examples are antigenic ‘imprinting’, where childhood exposure

21

offers heterosubtypic protection against zoonotic viruses later in life 33, and ‘antigenic

22

seniority’, where HA immune responses during a host’s lifetime tend to be biased towards

23

those strains encountered early in life 34. Other immune complexities that we have ignored

24

include short-lived, ‘strain-transcending’ immunity that has been proposed to explain

25

influenza evolutionary patterns 35; the complex relationship between immunodominance

26

and transmission-blocking 36; and the potential impact of UIVs on seasonal influenza

27

evolution 19. Nonetheless, as noted above, the aim of the current work is not to provide

28

definitive projections, but rather to illustrate the potential for population immune dynamics

29

to give rise to unintended consequences. Addressing the limitations described above,

30

through improved understanding of influenza immunity, would enable more robust

31

estimates of important parameters emerging from our analysis: for example, the minimum

32

vaccination coverage in order for a population to be protected against a pandemic (Fig.4).

33
34

In conclusion, although vaccination has offered great benefits in the control of influenza for

35

several decades, new technologies may offer qualitatively new opportunities for influenza

36

control; whether allowing routine seasonal vaccination programmes to adopt a stable

vaccine formulation over several years, or enabling programmes that can mitigate pandemic

2

risk on a population level. Previously we used simple models to illustrate these potential

3

benefits (15, 28). In the current work we build on these studies, incorporating additional

4

detail on immune dynamics to reveal some potential adverse effects of UIV programmes.

5

However, our results also show how these effects could be effectively mitigated, through

6

appropriate vaccine deployment. In view of the complex effects that UIVs could have on

7

population immunity, the design of their ‘target product profiles’ would benefit significantly

from population dynamics and evolutionary considerations.

vaccination in the USA. The model framework is described in detail in ref 21. In brief, the

5

model is a deterministic, compartmental, age-structured framework, capturing the influenza

6

epidemic in the USA at the national level, and allowing for different levels of prior immunity

7

in each of the age groups.

We built on a model previously developed to capture the impact of seasonal influenza

8

Modelling immunity

10

As described in the main text, the model incorporates two types of immunity: (i) HA-specific

11

immunity, which reduces susceptibility to infection, and (ii) Independently acting cross-

12

protective immunity, assumed not to affect susceptibility to infection, but rather to reduce

13

infectiousness (Table 1). For illustration we assumed vaccine-derived immunity to elicit

14

identical protection as infection-induced immunity (in strength and duration), but focusing

15

solely on specific antigens, whether HA-specific (as for conventional, strain-matched

16

vaccines) or broadly protective (as for universal vaccines). For simplicity, we focus on

17

inactivated vaccines and not live attenuated vaccines, the former of which account for the

18

majority of influenza vaccination in the USA. Moreover we did not aim to model the

19

dynamics of immunity across different influenza seasons, instead treating each epidemic

20

independently. In the absence of serology or other immunological data, it is not possible to

21

estimate separately the roles of HA-specific or cross-protective immunity, for a given

22

epidemic; instead we took the extreme (but simplifying) assumption that any cross-

23

protective immunity is short-lived, and does not persist between epidemic seasons. Thus, all

24

immunity at the beginning of the season is HA-specific: we estimated the age-specific

25

proportions having this immunity using the data described above.

viruses 33. We also ignored the potential impact of universal vaccination on influenza
evolution; this is consistent with genomic analysis suggesting that the principal source of
antigenic novelty for influenza is not the USA, but in South-East Asia and in the tropics 46,47.
Governing equations and calibration
For a single season, we neglected births and deaths in the host population. In the following
equations, we denote age groups with subscript i, where i = [1, 2, 3, 4] denote respectively 6
mo – 4 yrs, 5 – 19 yrs, 20 – 64 yrs, and >65 yrs. We denote vaccination status with the
conventional (HA-based) vaccine as j, where j = [0, 1] denotes respectively unvaccinated and
vaccinated individuals. Similarly we denote as 𝑘 the vaccination status with the cross10

where 𝛾 is the per-capita rate of recovery, and (for convenience of notation) the vaccine
status indices j, c are being used as indicator functions (i.e. their values 0, 1 being treated
not only as categorical, but also as multiplying terms in these equations).
Free model parameters, to be calibrated, included: the initial susceptibility in each age
group (as a result of past, strain-specific exposure); the overall rate of transmission per day;
and the age-specific effect of vaccination in reducing susceptibility. Treating each influenza
season independently, these parameters were estimated using the following data sources:
virologically confirmed influenza hospitalisations in each month; age-specific estimates of
vaccine efficacy (VE) for each season; and estimates of monthly, age-specific vaccine
coverage in each season. Additionally, the model is informed by ‘multipliers’ estimated by
the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which relate hospitalisations to
the incidence of symptomatic illness. In ref 21 we describe in detail how the model was fitted
to this data using Bayesian methods. In the present work, uncertainty estimates are less
critical than in ref. 21. For the simulations we therefore selected the best fitting parameter
set for the 2012/13 season, i.e. that maximising the posterior density constructed as in ref

UIV efficacy (reduction in transmission)
Figure 1. The potential impact of universal vaccination on past seasonal epidemics in the
US. Using a model calibrated to historical seasonal epidemics in the US, the figure shows the
epidemic sizes that would have occurred if each dose of the conventional vaccine were
replaced by a UIV (universal influenza vaccine), one that offers no reduction in susceptibility,
but that lowers transmission potential by a factor c (x-axis). Dots on lines mark the actual
epidemic sizes that occurred, under conventional vaccination, for each season: a UIV with
efficacy greater than indicated by these points would therefore outperform the
conventional vaccines used at the time.

Figure 2. Schematic of the overall modelling approach. We focus on the use of UIVs in
routine seasonal influenza vaccination. At stage (B) in the figure, population immunity
depends on both the vaccination programme at stage (A), and the ensuing seasonal
epidemic. However, the latter can be heavily influenced by the former; we use a dynamical
transmission model to capture these relationships. We then explore the implications of
immunity at stage (B) under two scenarios, illustrated on the right-hand side of the figure:
(i) where a pandemic virus emerges soon after the epidemic season (upper right-hand plot),
and (ii) alternatively, where a second epidemic season is caused by a variant capable of
escape from cross-protective immunity (lower right-hand plot). In each scenario, we assess
how final epidemic sizes at stage (C) are shaped by the choice of vaccination programme at
stage (A).

Figure 3. Implications of routine seasonal UIV for a population’s vulnerability to pandemic
influenza. As illustrated in figure 2 we model a 2012/13-like season in the USA, simulating a
scenario where conventional vaccines prior to this season were replaced by a UIV vaccine.
We then simulate the emergence of a novel pandemic strain, first assuming no vaccination
programme against this pandemic. Here and throughout, we define ‘efficacy’ of a UIV as the
percentage drop in transmission potential arising from vaccination. (A) Pandemic size under
a range of values for seasonal UIV coverage, and for UIV efficacy. Low seasonal UIV
coverage, especially for an efficacious vaccine, can yield a greater pandemic than in the
absence of vaccination. (B) An explanation of the behaviour in panel A, by showing
separately the total amount of vaccine-derived and infection-derived immunity in the
population, at a cross-section where UIV efficacy is assumed to be 80% (i.e. the ‘leading
edge’ of panel A). By bringing down seasonal epidemic sizes, seasonal universal vaccination
also brings down the total amount of infection-acquired immunity in the population (blue
curve). At low coverage, the vaccination programme fails to compensate for this loss of
immunity (yellow curve, initial decline). The dashed grey line indicates the level of crossprotective immunity in the absence of the UIV programme. The UIV programme succeeds in
increasing population immunity beyond this point at a threshold coverage of approximately
75%. (C) Relaxing the assumption of no pre-pandemic vaccination, again taking the crosssection corresponding to a UIV efficacy of 80%. As in panel B, the horizontal grey line
indicates the pandemic size in the absence of vaccination.

Efficacy, universal vaccine (pct)

Figure 4. Potential impact of vaccine failure. Figures show dynamics arising from a
2012/13-like epidemic (epidemic 1), followed by a seasonal virus capable of escape from
cross-protective immunity (epidemic 2). (A) With routine seasonal vaccination using a
conventional (strain-matched) vaccine, epidemic sizes are unchanged by this type of
immune escape. (B) With routine seasonal vaccination using a UIV, successful control of
epidemic 1 can have the unintended effect of permitting a larger epidemic 2. Dashed lines
show the epidemic peaks reached under a conventional vaccine (panel A), for comparison.
(C) How epidemic sizes in panel B change with UIV efficacy in epidemic 1 (we assume
throughout that this efficacy declines to 25% for epidemic 2, as a result of vaccine escape).
The figure illustrates how improving control of seasonal influenza (blue curve) could in fact
leave a population more vulnerable to an immune escape variant (red curve).
