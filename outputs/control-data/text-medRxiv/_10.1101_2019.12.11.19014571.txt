Abstract

12

Background: Electroencephalography-based brain-computer interfaces (BCI) that allow the

13

control of robotic devices to support stroke patients during upper limb rehabilitation are

14

increasingly popular. Hand rehabilitation is focused on improving dexterity and fine motor

15

control and is a core approach for helping stroke survivors regain activities of daily living.

16

This systematic review examines recent developments in BCI-robotic systems for hand

17

rehabilitation and identifies evidence-based clinical studies on stroke patients.

18

Methods: A search for January 2010-October 2019 articles using Ovid MEDLINE, Embase,

19

PEDro, PsycINFO, IEEE Xplore and Cochrane Library databases was performed. The

20

selection criteria included BCI-hand robotic systems for rehabilitation in various

21

development stages involving tests on healthy human subjects or stroke survivors. Data fields

22

include those related to study design, participant characteristics, technical specifications of

23

the system, and clinical outcome measures.

24

Results: 30 studies were identified as eligible for qualitative review and among these, 11

25

studies involved testing a BCI-hand robot on chronic and subacute stroke patients.

26

Statistically significant improvements in motor assessment scores relative to controls were

27

observed for two BCI-hand robot interventions. The degree of robot control for the majority

28

of studies was limited to triggering the device to perform grasping or pinching movements

29

using motor imagery. Most employed a combination of kinaesthetic and visual response via

30

the robotic device and display screen, respectively, to match feedback to motor imagery.

31

Conclusion: Most studies on BCI-robotic systems for hand rehabilitation report systems at

32

prototype or pre-clinical stages of development. Some studies report statistically significant

33

improvements in functional recovery after stroke, but there is a need to develop a standard

34

protocol for assessing technical and clinical outcomes so that the necessary evidence base on

35

efficiency and efficacy can be developed.

Background

41

There is growing interest in the use of robotics within the field of rehabilitation. This interest

42

is driven by the increasing number of people requiring rehabilitation following problems such

43

as stroke (with an ageing population), and the global phenomenon of insufficient numbers of

44

therapists able to deliver rehabilitation exercises to patients [1,2]. Robotic systems allow a

45

therapist to prescribe exercises that can then be guided by the robot rather than the therapist.

46

An important principle within the use of such systems is that the robots assist the patient to

47

actively undertake a prescribed movement rather than the patient’s limb being moved

48

passively. This means that it is necessary for the system to sense when the patient is trying to

49

generate the required movement (given that, by definition, the patient normally struggles with

50

the action). One potential solution to this issue is to use force sensors that can detect when the

51

patient is starting to generate the movement (at which point the robot’s motors can provide

52

assistive forces). It is also possible to use measures of muscle activation (EMGs) to detect the

53

intent to move [3]. There is, however, growing interest in the potential of using measures of

54

brain activity to identify when a patient is trying to generate a movement- referred to as Brain

55

Computer Interfaces, or BCIs. This interest in BCIs is motivated by idea that the

56

rehabilitation process can be enhanced by particular types of brain activity related to

57

imagining the movement [4]. There is a long history of using robotic devices for stroke

58

rehabilitation [5,6] and in the last decade, there has been a concerted effort by groups of

59

clinicians, neuroscientists and engineers to integrate these systems with incoming brain

60

signals to enhance the efficacy and effectiveness of stroke rehabilitation. The purpose of this

61

manuscript is to review the current state-of-the-art of existing brain-computer ‘closed loop’

62

interfaces in terms of the technological readiness of existing systems, and the evidence for

63

their clinical effectiveness.

64
65

BCIs allow brain state-dependent control of robotic devices to aid stroke patients during

66

upper limb therapy and have been gaining research attention since their first implementation

67

more than a decade ago [7,8]. Graimann et al. [4] defined a BCI as an artificial system that

68

provides direct communication between the brain and a device based on the user’s intent;

69

bypassing the normal efferent pathways of the body’s peripheral nervous system. A BCI

70

recognises user intent by measuring brain activity and translating it into executable

71

commands usually performed by a computer, hence the term “brain-computer interface”.

72
73

Most robotic devices used in upper limb rehabilitation exist in the form of exoskeletons or

74

end-effectors. Robotic exoskeletons (i.e., powered orthoses, braces) are wearable devices

75

where the actuators are biomechanically aligned with the wearer’s joints and linkages;

76

allowing the additional torque to provide assistance, augmentation and even resistance during

77

training [9]. In comparison, end-effector systems generate movement through applying forces

78

to the most distal segment of the extremity via handles and attachments [9]. Rehabilitation

79

robots are classified as Class II-B medical devices (i.e., a therapeutic device that administers

80

the exchange of energy, mechanically, to a patient) and safety considerations are important

81

during development [10,11]. Most commercial robots are focused on arms and legs, each

82

offering a unique therapy methodology. There is also a category of device that target the hand

83

and finger. Hand and finger rehabilitation are core component in regaining activities of daily

84

living (ADL) as many ADLs require dexterous and fine motor movements (e.g. grasping and

85

pinching). Thus, the current review is focused on devices that have been designed specifically

86

for wrist, hand and finger rehabilitation.

87
88

The potential of BCIs has gained considerable attraction because the neural activity involved

89

in the control of the robotic device may be a key component in the rehabilitation itself. For

90

example, mental rehearsal of movement is thought to activate some of the neural networks

91

involved in movement execution (ME) [12–15]. The resulting rationale is that encouraging

92

the use of motor imagery (MI) (i.e., the imagination of movement without execution) could

93

increase the capacity of the motor cortex to control major muscle movements and decrease

94

the necessity to use neural circuits damaged post-stroke. The scientific justification for this

95

approach was first provided by Jeannerod [15] who suggested that the neural substrates of MI

96

are part of a shared network that is also activated during the simulation of action by the

97

observation of action (AO) [15]. These ‘mirror neuron’ systems are thought to be an

98

important component of motor control and learning [15] - hence the belief that stimulating

99

these systems could aid rehabilitation.

100
101

A recent meta-analysis of the neural correlates of action (MI, AO and ME) quantified

102

‘conjunct’ and ‘contrast’ networks in the cortical and subcortical regions [12]. This analysis,

103

which took advantage of open-source historical data from fMRI studies, reported consistent

104

activation in the premotor, parietal and somatosensory areas for MI, AO and ME. Predicated

105

on such data, researchers have reasoned that stimulating MI should cause activation of the

106

neural substrates that are also involved in controlling movement and there have been a

107

number of research projects that have used AO in combination with MI in neurorehabilitation

108

[16–18] and motor learning studies [19,20] over the last decade.

110

The strategy of BCI-robot systems in rehabilitation is to recognise the patient's intention to

111

move or perform a task via an electroencephalography acquisition system [21], and then use

112

the robotic device to provide assistive forces in a manner that mimics the actions of a

113

therapist during standard therapy sessions [22]. The resulting feedback is patient-driven and

114

is designed to aid in closing the neural loop from intention to execution. This process is said

115

to promote use-dependent neuroplasticity within intact brain regions and relies on the

116

repeated experience of initiating and achieving a specified target [23,24]; making the active

117

participation of the patient in performing the therapy exercises an integral part of the motor

118

re-learning process [25,26]. It is important to note that whilst the rationale underpinning the

119

conjecture that BCI-robot systems could be useful in hand rehabilitation is reasonable, it is

120

just a conjecture that requires empirical support.

121
122

Electroencephalography (EEG) is currently the instrument of choice for data acquisition in

123

BCI systems because it is non-invasive, easy to use and can detect relevant brain activity with

124

high temporal resolution [27,28]. In principle, the recognition of MI activity via EEG can

125

allow the control of a device independent of muscle activity [4]. It has been shown that MI-

126

based BCI can discriminate motor intent by detecting event-related spectral perturbations

127

(ERSP) [21,29] and/or event-related desynchronisation/synchronisation (ERD/ERS) patterns

128

in the µ (9-11 Hz) and β (14-30 Hz) sensorimotor rhythm of EEG signals [29]. However,

129

EEG also brings with it some challenges- these neural markers are often concealed by various

130

artefacts and may be difficult to recognise through the raw EEG signal alone. Thus, signal

131

processing (via feature extraction and classification) is a vital part of obtaining a good MI

132

signal for robotic control.

134

One implication of using MI and AO to justify the use of BCI approaches is that great care

135

must be taken with regard to the quality of the environment in which the rehabilitation takes

136

place. An important feature of MI is that, by definition, the patient must be able to imagine

137

the movement. Likewise, AO requires the patients to clearly see the action. This suggests that

138

the richness and vividness of the visual cues provided is an essential part of an effective BCI

139

system. It is also reasonable to assume that feedback is important within these processes and

140

thus the quality of feedback should be considered as essential. Finally, motivation is known

141

to play an important role in promoting active participation during therapy [26,30]. Thus, a

142

good BCI system should incorporate an approach (such as gaming and positive reward) that

143

increases motivation. Recent advances in technology make it far easier to create a

144

rehabilitation environment that provides rich vivid cues, gives salient feedback and is

145

motivating. For example, the rise of immersive technologies, including virtual reality (VR)

146

and augmented reality (AR) platforms [31,30,32], allows for the creation of engaging visual

147

experiences that have the potential to improve a patient’s self-efficacy [33] and thereby

148

encourage the patient to maintain the rehabilitation regime. One specific example of this is

149

visually amplifying the movement made by a patient when the movement is of limited extent

150

so that the patient can see their efforts are producing results [34].

151
152

In this article, we review the development of BCI-robotic systems for hand rehabilitation and

153

capture clinical studies involving stroke patients. Our goal was to address three critical

154

questions for understanding the current value and potential of BCI-based robotic therapy:

155
156

(1) Identify how BCI technologies are being utilised in controlling robotic devices for

157

hand rehabilitation. Our focus was on the study design and the tasks that are

158

employed in setting up a BCI-hand robot therapy protocol.

159

(2) Document the state-of-art of BCI systems. Because BCI for rehabilitation is still an

160

emerging field of research, we expected that most studies would be in their proof-of-

161

concept or clinical testing stages of development. Our purpose was to determine the

162

limits of this technology in terms of: (a) resolution of hand MI detection and (b) the

163

degree of which we can have robotic control.

164

(3) Evaluate the clinical significance of BCI-hand robot systems by looking at the

165

outcome measures in motor recovery and determine if a standard protocol exists for

166

these interventions.

167
168

It is important to note that there have been several recent reviews exploring BCI for stroke

169

rehabilitation. For example, Monge-Pereira et al. [35] compiled EEG-based BCI studies for

170

upper limb stroke rehabilitation. Their systematic review (involving 13 clinical studies on

171

stroke and hemiplegic patients) reported on research methodological quality and

172

improvements in the motor abilities of stroke patients. Cervera et al. [36] performed a meta-

173

analysis on the clinical effectiveness of BCI-based stroke therapy among 9 randomised

174

clinical trials (RCT). McConnell et al. [37] reviewed and provided insights from a total of

175

110 robotic devices with brain-machine interfaces for hand rehabilitation post-stroke. These

176

reviews, in general, have reported that such systems provide improvements in both functional

177

and clinical outcomes in pilot studies or trials involving small sample sizes. Thus, the

178

literature indicates that EEG-based BCI are a promising general approach for rehabilitation

179

post-stroke.

180
181

The current work complements these previous reports by focusing on a systematic review of

182

the rehabilitation of the fine motor skills associated with hand movement, and profiling BCI-

183

robot systems for the hands with their corresponding technical and clinical implementations.

207

Two authors performed independent screenings of titles and abstracts based on the inclusion

208

and exclusion criteria. The use of a third reviewer was planned a priori in cases where a lack

209

of consensus existed around eligibility. However, consensus was achieved from the first two

210

authors during this stage. Full-text articles were then obtained, and a second screening was

211

performed until a final list of studies was agreed to be included for data extraction.

The general characteristics of the study and their corresponding results were extracted from

215

the full-text articles by the reviewers following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic

216

Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. Data fields included those related to study

217

design, participant characteristics, technical specifications of the system, and technical and

218

experimental results. For studies involving stroke patients, clinical outcomes were obtained

219

based on muscle improvement measures such as Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment (FMMA)

220

scores [38], Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) scores [39], United Kingdom Medical

221

Research Council (UK-MRC) muscle grade [40], Grip Strength (GS) Test and Pinch Strength

222

(PS) Test scores (i.e., kilogram force collected using an electronic hand dynamometer)

223

among others.

224

Quality Assessment

225

Technological Readiness

226

We first assessed the development stages of the systems used in the studies extracted. By

227

performing a Technological Readiness Assessment (TRA), we were able to determine the

228

maturity of the systems via a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) scale of 1-9 and quantify its

229

implementation in a research or clinical setting. Since a BCI-robot for rehabilitation can be

230

categorised as a Class II-B medical device we have adapted a customised TRL scale to

231

account for these requirements [41].

232
233

Clinical Use

234

A methodological quality assessment was also performed for clinical studies based on the

235

Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) Scale [42]. This scale evaluates studies with a

236

checklist of 11 items based on experts’ consensus criteria in physiotherapy practice. The

237

complete details of the criteria can be found online [43]. A higher score in the PEDro scale (6

238

and above) implied better methodological quality but are not used as a measure of validity in

239

terms of clinical outcomes. Pre-defined scores from this scale were already present in studies

240

appearing in the PEDro search. However, studies without PEDro scores or are not present in

241

the PEDro database at all had to be manually evaluated by the authors against the 11-item

242

checklist (five of seven studies).

A total of 590 studies were initially identified. After deduplication, 330 studies underwent

251

title and abstract screening. Forty six studies passed this stage and among these, 16 were

252

removed after full-text screening due to the following reasons: insufficient EEG and robotic

data [44–50], the study was out of scope [51–53], the study design was not for hand/finger

254

movement [54–57], no robot or mechatronic device was involved in the study [58,59]. A final

[60–70] were involved in testing the BCI-hand robot system on chronic and subacute stroke

Technology Evaluation

263

EEG Acquisition

264

The choice of EEG system as well as the type of electrodes provides a technical trade-off and

265

affects the session both in terms of subjective experiences (i.e., ease-of-use, preparation time,

266

cleaning, comfortability) and data performance. Due to the presence of a conducting

267

gel/solution, standard “wet” electrodes provide a degree of confidence in preventing signal

268

disruption within a short duration usually enough for a standard stroke therapy session.

269

However, this also makes the setup, use and cleaning in the experiment more challenging, non-

270

ambulatory and reliant on a specialised laboratory setup [4]. Conversely, dry electrodes offer

271

an accessible, user-friendly and portable alternative by using dry metal pins or coatings that

272

comb through hair and come in contact directly with the scalp. The signal fidelity of dry

273

electrodes is still a matter of debate in the BCI community. A systematic comparison between

274

dry passively-amplified and wet actively-amplified electrodes reported similar performance in

275

the detection of event-related potentials (ERP) [90]. However, for a study involving dry active

276

electrodes [91], high inter-electrode impedance resulted in increased single-trial and average

277

noise levels as compared to both active and passive wet electrodes. In classifying MI,

278

movement-related artefacts adversely affect active dry electrodes, but these can be addressed

279

through a hybrid system of other physiological sensors to separate sources [92].

The EEG acquisition systems involved in the studies ranged from low-cost devices having few

electrode channels (2-15 gel or saline-soaked silver/silver chloride [Ag/AgCl] electrodes) to

283

standard EEG caps that had higher spatial resolution (16-256 gel or saline-soaked Ag/AgCl

284

electrodes). The placement of EEG channels was accounted for by studies involving MI

285

(N=21). This allowed us to determine the usage frequency among electrodes and is presented

286

in Figure 2 as a heat map generated in R Studio (using the packages: “akima”, “ggplot2” and

287

“reshape2”) against the 10-20 international electrode placement system.

292

It can be seen that the EEG channels used for MI studies are concentrated towards electrodes

293

along the central sulcus (C) region and the frontal lobe (F) region of the placement system

294

where the motor cortex strip lies. Among these, C3 (N=17) and F3 (N=14) were mostly used,

295

presumably because a majority of the participants were right-handed. The next most frequent

296

were C4 (N=13) and the electrodes F4, Cz and CP3 (N=10).

Signal Processing: Feature Extraction and Classification

299

It is necessary to process EEG data if they are to be used as a control signal. First, the data

300

need to undergo a series of pre-processing routines (e.g., filtering and artefact removal)

301

before feature extraction and classification for use as a control signal for the robotic hand.

302

Feature extraction involves recognising useful information (e.g., spectral power, time epochs,

303

spatial filtering) for better discriminability among mental states. For example, the common

304

spatial patterns (CSP) algorithm is a type of spatial filter that learns and maximises the

305

variance of band pass-filtered EEG from one class to discriminate it to the other [93].

306
307

In the EEG-based BCI studies examined, it was found that the feature extraction and

308

classification techniques were variable between systems. Table 3 provides a summary of pre-

309

processing, feature extraction and classification techniques across the studies. There was a

310

wide variation in the implemented signal processing strategies, but a unifying theme across

311

studies was the attempt to: (i) discriminate mental states recorded in EEG across different

312

manual tasks; (ii) classify the different states to produce a viable signal.

Robot-Assisted Rehabilitation

319

Robotic hand rehabilitation systems provide kinaesthetic feedback to the user during BCI trials.

320

Most of these devices are powered by either DC motors, servomotors or pneumatic actuators

321

that transmit energy via rigid links or Bowden cables in a tendon-like fashion. The studies in

322

this review included single-finger [69–71], multi-finger [67] (including EMOHEX [63,64,72]),

323

full hand gloves [73,74] (including mano: Hand Exoskeleton [75] and Gloreha [76]) and full

324

arm exoskeletons with isolated finger actuation (BRAVO-Hand [61]). Nine of the studies

325

[62,72,73,75,77–81] presented their novel design of a hand rehabilitation device within the

326

article while some reported on devices reported elsewhere (i.e., in a previous study of the group

327

or a research collaborator). Two commercially-available devices were also used: AMADEO

328

(Tyromotion, Austria) is an end-effector device used in 3 studies [82–84], and Gloreha

329

(Idrogenet, Italy) is a full robotic hand glove used by Tacchino et al. [76]. AMADEO and

330

Gloreha are both rehabilitation devices that have passed regulatory standards in their respective

331

regions. AMADEO remains the gold standard for hand rehabilitation devices as it has passed

332

safety and risk assessments and provided favourable rehabilitation outcomes. The International

333

Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) provides three specific domains that

334

can be used to assess an intervention of this kind: improving impairments, supporting

335

performance of activities and promoting participation [96,97]. In this case, a gold standard

336

device not only prioritises user safety (established early in the development process) but also

337

delivers favourable outcomes in scales against these domains. Figure 3 shows the main types

338

of robotic hand rehabilitation devices.

Quality Assessment

345

A Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) was performed for each study and the

346

Technology Readiness Levels (TRL) are presented in Table 4. While some of the system

347

components (especially among robotic devices) were commercially available (having TRL

348

9+), we performed a TRA on the whole system (the interaction between BCI and robotics) to

349

provide an evaluation of its maturity and state-of-the-art development with regard to

350

rehabilitation medicine. We further assessed the TRL of each system at the time of the

351

publication and its subsequent development.

Clinical Evaluation

358

Studies with Stroke Patients (Clinical Group)

359

A total of 208 stroke patients (with sample size varying 3-74) were involved in the 11 clinical

360

studies. One study [60] reported a 3-armed RCT with control groups as device-only and SAT

361

while another study [65] was a multi-centre RCT with sham as the control group. Five studies

362

were uncontrolled – where the aims were either to study classification accuracies during

363

sessions [61], to monitor clinical outcomes improvement from Day 0 until the end of the

364

programme [62,70] or both [64,67]. Two studies [68,69] compared effects of the intervention

365

against SHAM feedback. Another study [63] compared the classification accuracies of

366

healthy and hemiplegic stroke patients against two BCI classifiers while the remaining study

367

[66] compared classification accuracies from stroke patients who receive congruent or

368

incongruent visual and kinaesthetic feedback.

369
370

Most of the studies adopted FMMA, ARAT and GS measurements to assess clinical

371

outcomes. Six studies [60,62,64,65,68,70] reported patient improvement in these measures

372

when subjected to BCI-hand robot interventions; in contrast with their respective controls or

373

as recorded through time in the programme. For Ang et al. [60], FMMA Distal scores were

374

reported in weeks 3, 6, 12 and 24 and the BCI-device group (N=6) yielded the highest

375

improvement in scores across all time points as compared to the device only (N=8) and SAT

376

(N=7) groups. Bundy et al. [62] reported an average of 6.20±3.81 improvement in the ARAT

377

scores of its participants (N=10) in the span of 12 weeks while Chowdhury et al. [64]

378

reported a group mean difference of +6.38 kg (p=0.06) and +5.66 (p<0.05) in GS and ARAT

379

scores, respectively (N=4). Frolov et al.’s [65] multi-centre RCT reported a higher

380

improvement in the FMMA Distal, ARAT Grasp and ARAT Pinch scores of the BCI-device

381

group (N=55) when compared to the control/SHAM group (N=19), but not in the ARAT Grip

383

p=0.045 for the control.

384
385

Studies with Healthy Participants (Prototype Group)

386

The studies which involved pilot testing on healthy human participants had a combined total

387

of individuals (sample size ranging from 1-32) who had no history of stroke or other

388

neurological diseases. Right-handed individuals made up 44.24% of the combined population

389

while the other 55.76% were unreported. These studies aimed to report the successful

390

implementation of a BCI-robot system for hand rehabilitation and were more heterogeneous

391

in terms of study and task designs than those studies that involved clinical testing. The most

392

common approach was to design and implement a hand orthosis controlled by MI which

393

accounted for 9 out of the 19 studies and were measured based on classification accuracy

394

during the calibration/training period and online testing. Li et al. [73] and Stan et al. [79] also

395

aimed to trigger a hand orthosis but instead of MI, the triggers used by Li et al. is based on an

396

attention threshold while Stan et al. used a vision-based P300 speller BCI. Bauer et al. [82]

397

compared MI against ME using a BCI-device while Ono et al. [85] studied the

398

implementation of an action observation strategy with a combined visual and kinaesthetic

399

feedback or auditory feedback. Five more studies [76,80,81,83,84] focused on varying the

400

feedback while two more [74,86] assessed the performance and safety of a hybrid BCI with

401

EMG, EOG or both.

402
403

For the studies that had a clinical testing component, a methodological quality assessment by

404

the PEDro Scale was performed. Two studies which appeared on the PEDro search [60,65]

405

had predetermined scores in the scale and were extracted for this part while the rest were

406

manually evaluated by the authors. Table 5 shows the results of the methodological quality

413

Discussion

414

To the best of our knowledge, this article was the first to compile BCI-driven robotic systems

415

specific for hand rehabilitation. During this review, we found several limitations present

416

among the studies collected and we examine these in more detail here and provide

417

recommendations for future work in this area.

418
419

To provide clarity on the state-of-the-art and development of BCI-hand robot systems, we

420

looked into the maturity of technology used in each study and determined by its readiness

421

level (TRL). All but one in the prototype group was rated as having TRL 3 while the clinical

422

group was more varied in their TRL (ranging from 5-7). The system used by Witkowski et al.

423

[86], a prototype study, was rated TRL 4 due to the study being performed on the basis of

424

improving and assessing its safety features. It is also worth noting that while a formal safety

425

assessment was not performed for the TRL 3 prototypes of Stan et al. [79], Randazzo et al.

426

[75] and Tacchino et al. [76], safety considerations and/or implementations were made; a

427

criterion to be satisfied before proceeding to TRL 4. The system used by Chowdhury et al. is

428

a good example of improving a TRL from 5 to 6 with a pilot clinical study published within

429

the same year [63,64]. The two systems used in the RCT studies by Ang et al. [60] and

430

Frolov et al. [65] achieved the highest score (TRL 7) among all of the studies which also

431

meant that no BCI-hand robot system for stroke rehabilitation has ever been registered and

432

commercially-released to date. This suggests that such systems lack the strong evidence that

433

would propel commercialisation and technology adoption.

434
435

Heterogeneity in the study designs was apparent in both the clinical and prototype groups.

436

The lack of control groups and random allocation in clinical studies (e.g., only 2 out of 7

437

studies are in the huge sample size RCT stage) made us unable to perform a meta-analysis of

438

effects and continue the study by Cervera et al [36] with a focus on BCI-hand robot

439

interventions. Results from the methodological quality assessment showed that only two

440

studies [68,69] had a score of 7 in the PEDro scale. Although non-conclusive, these results

441

support the notion that most of the studies are not aligned with the criteria of high-quality

442

evidence-based interventions. These factors also raise the need to develop clearly defined

443

protocols when conducting BCI-hand robot studies on stroke patients. Until new systems

444

have been assessed on this standard, it will be difficult to generate strong evidence supporting

445

the effectiveness of BCI-robotic devices for hand rehabilitation.

446
447

In the development of any BCI-robotic device there are several design and feature

448

considerations that need to be made to ensure that the systems are both fit for purpose and

449

acceptable to the end-user. These design considerations must go beyond the scope of

450

understanding the anatomy of the hand and the physiology of motor recovery in response to

451

therapy. Feedback from stroke patients should be an essential part of this design process. the

452

extracted studies, we surveyed the extent of end-user involvement in the initial stages of

453

development (i.e., through consultations, interviews and therapy observations) and we found

454

that there were no explicit statements about these in the reports. We recommend, as good

455

practice, for future work in this area to report the type and degree of patient and/or physician

456

involvement in device development to allow reviewers and readers to more readily gauge the

457

potential usability of the system.

458
459

We were able to profile the BCI-hand robot systems regarding their technical specifications

460

and design features. In hardware terms, a BCI-hand robot system involves three major

461

components: (1) An EEG data acquisition system with several electrodes connected to a

462

signal amplifier; (2) A computer where raw EEG data is received then processed by filters

463

and classifiers and where most of the cues and feedback during training is presented via a

464

visual display; (3) a robotic hand rehabilitation system for providing the physical therapy

465

back to the user.

466
467

The majority of the studies (N=19) used a BCI solely based on EEG while the rest were

468

combined with other sensors: EEG with EMG [60,63,72,76,80–83], EEG with force sensors

469

[64] and an EEG-EMG-EOG hybrid system [74,86]. The purpose of this integration is mainly

470

to improve signal quality by accounting for artefacts or to provide added modalities. Action

471

potentials such as those caused by ocular and facial movements interfere with nearby

472

electrodes and the presence of an added electrophysiological sensor accounting for these

473

would enable the technician to perform noise cancellation techniques as a first step in signal

474

processing. Almost all of the studies included used a standard EEG system with “wet”

475

electrodes (e.g., g.USBamp by g.tec and BrainAmp by Brain Products) while three used

476

Emotiv EPOC+, a semi-dry EEG system that uses sponge conductors infused with saline

solution. While the use of dry electrodes has been observed in pilot and prototype studies of

478

BCI-hand robot systems [52,49,78,87] and other motor imagery experiments [99–102], no

479

dry EEG system was used in the final 30 studies that tested healthy or stroke participants. It is

480

expected that as dry EEG systems continue to improve, their use in clinical studies of BCI

481

will also become increasingly prominent.

482
483

The degree of BCI-robotic control for the majority of the studies (N=26) was limited to

484

triggering the device to perform grasping (opening and closing of hand) and pinching (a

485

thumb-index finger pinch or a 3-point thumb-index-middle finger pinch) movements using

486

MI and other techniques. This means that no robotic control setup among the screened studies

487

were able to perform digit-specific MI. This is a limitation caused by the non-invasive setup

488

of EEG and is due to the low spatial resolution brought by the distances between electrodes

489

[103]. The homunculus model, a representation of the human body in the motor strip, maps

490

the areas of the brain where activations have been reported to occur for motor processes. The

491

challenge of decoding each finger digit MI in one hand is that they only tend to occupy a

492

small area in this strip. Hence even the highest resolution electrode placement system (i.e.,

493

the five percent or 10-5 system – up to 345 electrodes) would have difficulties accounting for

494

digit-specific MI for BCI. In contrast to EEG, electrocorticography (ECoG) have been used

495

to detect digit-specific MI. The electrodes of ECoG come in contact directly with the motor

496

cortex and is an invasive procedure; making it non-ideal for use in BCI therapy [104]. It is

497

worth noting however that some studies were successful in implementing continuous control

498

based on ERD/ERS patterns: Bundy et al. [62] and Norman et al. [67] were able to apply

499

continuous control of a 3-DOF pinch-grip exoskeleton based on spectral power while Bauer

500

et al. [82] provided ERD-dependent control of finger extension for an end-effector robot.

501

These continuous control strategies have been shown to be very useful in BCI-hand robots for

502

assistive applications (i.e., partial or full device dependence for performing ADL tasks [105]).

503

Whether this type of control can significantly improve stroke recovery is still in question as

504

the strategy of robots for stroke rehabilitation can be more classified as a therapeutic

505

“exercise” device.

506
507

Signal processing and machine learning play a vital role in the development of any EEG-

508

based BCI. The pre-processing techniques (e.g., filtering, artefact removal), types of features

509

computed from EEG, and the classifier used in machine learning can significantly affect the

510

performance of the robotic system in classifying the user’s intent via MI [106]. This

511

systematic review has revealed that approaches to develop MI EEG-based BCI are highly

512

diverse in nature, which makes it difficult to compare across the systems and hinders the

513

development of new BCI systems informed by the strengths and weaknesses of existing state-

514

of-the-art systems. The diversity in the design process can be beneficial to develop complex

515

MI EEG-based BCI systems to achieve high efficiency and efficacy. However, such newly

516

developed systems should be open sourced and easily reproducible by the research

517

community to provide valid performance comparisons and drive forward the domain of

518

robotic-assisted rehabilitation.

519
520

In addition to MI, other strategies for robotic control were reported. Diab et al. [88] and King

521

et al. [89] both facilitated the movements of their respective orthoses by physical practice

522

while Stan et al. [79] utilised a P-300 evoked potential speller BCI, where the user visually

523

focused on a single alphanumerical character situated in a grid. The chosen character then

524

corresponded to a command for the hand orthosis thereby producing the desired stimulus for

525

the patient. While the latter study reported 100% accuracy rate in terms of intention and

526

execution, the EEG channels were situated in the visual cortex rather than the motor strip

527

which deviates from the goal of stimulating the desired brain region for plasticity.

528
529

In order to facilitate hand MI and account for significant time-points in the EEG data, all the

530

studies employed a cue-feedback strategy during their trials. 19 of the studies presented a

531

form of visual cue while the rest, except for two unspecified [69,87], involved cues in

532

auditory (“bleep”) [76,80–83], textual [78,79,89] or verbal [88] forms. As for the provision of

533

a matching sensory feedback, 16 studies presented a combination of kinaesthetic and visual

534

feedback with some also providing auditory feedback during successful movement attempts.

535

All the studies provided kinaesthetic feedback through their robotic devices. Some systems

536

with visual feedback, such as Wang et al. [68], Li et al. [73], Chowdhury et al. in both of their

537

clinical studies [63,64] and Ono et al. in their clinical [66] and pilot testing experiments [85],

538

used a video of an actual hand performing the desired action. Ang et al. [60] and Stan et al.

539

[79], in a different strategy, provided visual feedback through photo manipulation and textual

540

display, respectively. While the latter two studies reported promising results (with Ang et al.

541

in RCT stage and Stan et al. having 100% classification accuracy), it should also be

542

considered that such cue and feedback types (including Graz visualisations and auditory

543

forms) are non-representative of hand movement and may not provide the same stimulation

544

as a geometrical representation of a hand moving its desired course. This may be essential

545

when we base principles of stroke recovery in alignment with how MI correlates with AO –

546

an underlying theme of the motor simulation theory proposed by Jeannerod [15]. Figure 4

547

shows how different kinds of visual cue and feedback can be presented to participants to help

548

facilitate MI.

Future Directions

555

There is clearly great potential for the use of BCI-hand robots in the rehabilitation of an

556

affected hand following stroke. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasise that there is

557

currently no solid evidence to support the use of such systems within clinical settings.

558

Moreover, the purported benefits of these systems rest on conjectures that require empirical

559

evidence. In other words, there are grounds for supposing that MI could be useful within

560

these rehabilitation settings but no supporting evidence. This systematic review has also

561

revealed that there are a number of technological limitations to existing BCI-hand robotic

562

systems. We stress an urgent need to address these limitations to ensure that the systems meet

563

the minimum required levels of product specification (in measuring brain activity, processing

564

signals, delivering forces to the hand and providing rich feedback and motivating settings).

565

We question the ethics or usefulness of conducting clinical trials with such systems until they

566

can demonstrate minimum levels of technological capability. We consider below what

567

standards these systems should obtain before subjecting them to a clinical trial and discuss

568

might constitute an acceptable standard for a clinical trial.

569
570

Ideal Setup for a BCI-hand Robot

571

We summarise the information revealed via the systematic review about what constitutes an

572

acceptable setup for a BCI-hand robot for stroke rehabilitation. We focus on improving

573

individual components in data acquisition, data processing, the hand rehabilitation robot, and

574

the visual cue and feedback environment. Table 6 presents the features and specifications of a

575

fully integrated acceptable system.

Table 6. Exemplary Features and Specifications of Future BCI-Hand Robot Systems

577
Component

Features and Specifications

Data Acquisition

• Dry EEG system with 8-16 channels, comfortable and easy to use

System and Software

• Inclusion of other bio-signal sensors such as EMG, EOG, force,
accelerometers to remove artefacts and improve classification
• Robust and reliable signal processing software: machine learningbased algorithms that discriminate brain states such as MI or
evoked potentials and have lower calibration times

Hand Robot

• Safe, comfortable and aligned with the hand’s range of motion
• Effective in providing kinaesthetic feedback
• Use of back-drivable or soft actuators that effectively assist
movement without additional injury
• Multiple levels of safety and emergency features (mechanical,
electronic, software), clear and obvious operation

Visual Cue and
Feedback

• Provide rich visual cue and feedback to intended tasks, geometric
representation of the hand (video or simulated environment), can
be in multiple platforms such as display monitors or VR/AR
headsets
• Gamification of therapy exercises to provide an engaging regime to
stroke patients

578
579
580

The implementation of these features in an ideal BCI-robot setup needs to be weighed against

581

socioeconomic factors in healthcare delivery for it to be considered market ready. An ideal

582

BCI system should provide above chance-level classification (>60%) after the first session on

583

the first day of therapy. Ideally, the classification algorithm should also translate to following

584

sessions or days; reducing the number of training sessions and focusing on the main therapy

585

tasks. An alternative approach is to focus on making the setup an engaging experience. In

586

other words, the delivery of intervention can be started immediately the patient wears the

587

EEG cap and runs the BCI system. For the hand robot system, more straightforward criteria

588

can be followed with the existence of the numerous design protocols, regulation standards

589

and assessment matrices mentioned in this review. Nevertheless, end-user involvement in the

590

design with the prioritisation of safety while allowing the most natural hand movement and

591

ROM as possible is the recommended goal.

592
593

Ideal Setup for Clinical Trials

594

We also propose a set of specialised criteria for BCI-hand robot systems in addition to the

595

standard motor improvement scores (e.g. ARAT, FMMA) evaluated during clinical trials.

596

Firstly, classification accuracies between intended and interpreted actions from the data

597

acquisition and software component should always be accounted to track the effectiveness of

598

BCI in executing the clinical task. In addition to this, system calibration and training

599

procedures, especially its duration, should be detailed in the protocol to document the

600

reliability of the classification algorithm. There is not much to consider in the use of robotic

601

devices as they are most likely to be mature (if not yet commercially available) before being

602

used as the hardware component in the study. However, the devices’ functionality (i.e., task

603

to be performed, degree of control and motion, actuation and power transmission etc.) should

604

always be stated as they contribute to the evaluation of interactions between other

605

components in the system. Lastly, controls for the clinical study must always be included,

606

even with small-scale patient studies. As discussed in this article, these controls may be in the

607

form of sham, standard arm therapy (SAT), standard robotic therapy, congruency feedback

608

and quality of stimuli among others. Having regarded and implemented these criteria would

609

help homogenise the clinical data for future meta-analyses, strengthen evidence-based results

610

and provide a reliable way of documentation for individual and/or interacting components.

611

Proposed roadmap

612

We suggest that the immediate focus for BCI-controlled robotic device research should be

613

around the engineering challenges. It is only when these challenges have been met that it is

614

useful and ethical to subject the systems to clinical trials. We recommend that the challenges

615

be broken down into the following elements: (1) data acquisition; (2) signal processing and

616

classification; (3) robotic device; (4) priming and feedback environment; (5) integration of

617

these four elements. The nature of these challenges means that a multidisciplinary approach is

618

required (e.g. the inclusion of psychologists, cognitive neuroscientists and physiologists to

619

drive the adoption of reliable neural data acquisition). It seems probable that progress will be

620

made by different laboratories tackling some or all of these elements and coordinating

621

information sharing and technology improvements. Once the challenges have been met (i.e.

622

there is a system that is able to take neural signals and use these to help drive a robotic

623

system capable of providing appropriate forces to the hand within a motivating environment)

624

then robust clinical trials can be conducted to ensure that the promise of this approach does

625

translate into solid empirical evidence supporting the use of these systems within clinical

626

settings.

Conclusions

628

Research on BCI-controlled robotic devices for hand rehabilitation after stroke is a rapidly

629

growing field and is gaining traction in the academic and medical research communities. The

630

three main objectives of this systematic review were: (1) to survey how BCI technologies are

631

utilised in controlling robotic devices for hand rehabilitation, (2) to determine the state-of-

632

the-art developments in BCI systems in terms of hand MI resolution and degree of robotic

633

control, and (3) to assess the clinical significance of BCI-hand robot systems by accounting

634

clinical studies with outcome measures relating to motor recovery. Here, we were able to

635

address these three and provide insight on the future of BCI-controlled robotics for stroke

636

therapy.

637
638

We surveyed 30 EEG-based BCI-hand robot systems designed for stroke with majority of the

639

studies (N=19) in their prototype development and pilot testing stages having TRL scores of

640

3-4. The rest of the studies (N=11) involved a clinical component into it, having tested on

641

stroke patients. The systems used in the clinical group were rated with the highest

642

technological readiness: TRL 7 for two studies undergoing RCT. Profiling the EEG

643

acquisition systems confirmed the still dominance of standard EEG systems that uses “wet”

644

electrodes over the recent dry electrode systems. However, as the latter’s technology

645

continues to improve in the next years, we may see a positive shift towards these techniques

646

in terms of usage and preference. The common goal among these studies is to successfully

647

discriminate and with high accuracy a user’s intent via motor imagery. While most have

648

reported reliable, above chance-level accuracy rates, we observe the limitations evident in

649

hand motor imagery resolution (e.g., intention to grasp or pinch as opposed to rest,

650

discriminating from left and right movement, signal processing techniques) and the degree of

651

robotic control (i.e., triggering and continuous control). The task designs, cues and matching

652

sensory feedback modes play an important role in motor imagery ability. We give attention to

653

the inferior visual stimuli presented in most of the trials and suggest the use of a rich and

654

engaging one through the different immersive platforms such as Virtual Reality and

655

Augmented Reality. We also report that the clinical adoption of BCI-hand robots is still in its

656

infancy due to few studies reporting significant improvements in the functional recovery of

657

stroke patients. We suggest the development of a standard protocol in assessing clinical

658

outcomes as an effort to strengthen the argument that these systems are not only

659

economically feasible but also viable and robust for the therapy of motor impairment post-

660

stroke.

661
662

Finally, we recommend that future developers focus on end-user involvement in the early

663

design stages, achieving the successful integration of the individual components and making

664

the system as safe and cost-effective as possible without compromising on reliability and

665

robustness. These steps should allow this promising technology to advance, be adopted by the

666

stakeholders and improve the quality of life for stroke survivors.

Main Outcomes

Study on MI as
compared to motor
execution (ME) using
BCI-device

Opening of left hand

EEG: 31 channels to
detect ERD, with EMG
to classify MI from
execution and account
for tonic contraction

Principal component analyses (between
MI and execution) generated coefficients
for the visual (VIS) and kinaesthetic
(KIS) imagery scale, BCI-robot
performance (BRI), tonic contraction
task (MOC) and visuomotor integration
task (VMI). VIS and KIS yielded high
coefficients on MI while MOC and VMI
yield high coefficients on ME. BRI show
high coefficient yields on both MI and
ME.

Cue: visual (coloured
cursor ball)

EEG: 128 channels to
detect ERD/ERS
during MI (F3, CP3,
C3 used)

MI + kinaesthetic feedback group
resulted in higher beta ERS (p=0.02)
during rest and higher beta ERD
(p=0.04) during MI

Feedback: visual and
kinaesthetic (separated
by experimental groups)

Device: Amadeo,
Tyromotion, Austria

Kinaesthetic feedback provides higher
stability and sustained beta ERD activity
than visual feedback

Control: trigger
