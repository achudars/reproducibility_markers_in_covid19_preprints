ABSTRACT

32

Objective

33

To investigate the relationship between post-diagnosis physical activity and mortality in

34

patients with selected noncommunicable diseases, including breast cancer, lung cancer, type 2

35

diabetes (T2D), ischemic heart disease (IHD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

36

(COPD), stroke, osteoarthritis, low back pain and major depressive disorders.

37

Design

38

Systematic review and dose–response meta-analysis.

39

Data sources

40

PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science were searched systematically for English

41

publications from the inception of the platforms until August 2018. Additionally, the search

42

was updated in August 2019.

43

Eligibility criteria

44

Prospective observational studies examining the relationship between at least three physical

45

activity categories and all-cause mortality or disease-specific mortality as the primary

46

outcome.

47
48

Results
In total, 28 studies were included: 12 for breast cancer, 6 for T2D, 8 for IHD and 2 for COPD.

49

The linear meta-analysis revealed that each 10 metabolic equivalent tasks (MET) h increase of

50

physical activity per week was associated with a 22% lower mortality rate in breast cancer

51

patients (Hazard Ratio [HR], 0.78; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.86), 12% in IHD patients (HR, 0.88; 95%

52

CI: 0.83, 0.93), 30% in COPD patients (HR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.45, 1.09) and 4% in T2D

53

patients (HR, 0.96; 95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). The non-linear meta-analysis showed a regressive

54

association with no threshold for the beneficial effect of physical activity on mortality.

55
56

Conclusion
Higher levels of post-diagnosis physical activity are associated with lower mortality rates in

57

breast cancer, T2D, IHD and COPD patients, with evidence of a no-threshold and non-linear

58

dose–response pattern.

75

INTRODUCTION
Physical activity has been proposed as a form of treatment for people with noncommunicable

76

diseases (NCDs).[1] There is evidence for the central role that physical activity plays in the

77

health status of people with NCDs. Regular physical activity positively influences symptoms

78

and comorbidities, physical fitness and health-related quality of life in more than 25 NCDs,

79

including osteoarthritis, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), stroke and clinical depression.[1]

80

However, it is less clear whether higher levels of physical activity in adults with NCDs also

81

reduce mortality rates and thus lead to longer life expectancies.

82

The current evidence for the general population regarding physical activity and mortality is

83

comprehensive and unambiguous. Numerous large cohort studies have consistently

84

demonstrated an inverse relationship between physical activity levels and mortality.[2] Meta-

85

analyses with pooled data from these studies produce similar findings.[3, 4] Compared with

86

the lower physical activity groups, the risk of premature death was remarkably reduced in the

87

higher physical activity groups. The meta-analysis conducted by Samitz et al.[4] included 80

88

primary studies with a total of 1,338,143 participants and revealed that per one hour

89

increment of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, the relative risk of mortality was

90

reduced by 4%. In the updated physical activity guidelines for healthy adults from the U.S.

91

Department of Health and Human Services,[5] a clear dose–response association between the

92

volume of physical activity and mortality rates has been shown. The shape of the dose–

93

response curve is characterized by a regressive, non-linear effect, where the greatest

94

difference in mortality rates occurs among inactive and minimally active individuals. For

95

higher physical activity levels, the dose–response curve flattens out. This means that the

96

relative risk of mortality continues to decline with higher volumes of physical activity with no

97

adverse effects on mortality, even at very high levels of physical activity.[5]

98

In adults with NCDs, the current evidence on dose–response relations between physical

99

activity and mortality is considerably weaker and inconsistent. For T2D, the meta-analysis

100

conducted by Kodama et al.[6] found that an increment of one MET (metabolic equivalent

101

tasks) h/day of physical activity was associated with a 9.5% relative risk reduction in all-

102

cause mortality, thereby suggesting that post-diagnosis physical activity levels may result in

103

similar mortality risk reductions compared to the general population. In a meta-analysis for

104

patients with cancer, comparably beneficial associations between physical activity and

105

mortality rates were reported by Li et al.[7]. Moore et al.[8] pooled data from six cohort

106

studies of 654,827 individuals and adjusted their analysis for several confounders, including

107

preexisting NCDs. In contrast, they concluded that the longevity effects of physical activity

108

vary according to the preexisting NCDs, with higher benefits of regular physical activity in

109

terms of life expectancy for those with a history of cancer (7.0 y) and heart disease (6.2 y)

110

compared to those without these diseases (3.7 y).[8] Current evidence from the US Physical

111

Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee[9] reported a general relationship between higher

112

post-diagnosis physical activity and lower mortality rates in five NCDs (breast or colorectal

113

or prostate cancer, the cardiovascular condition of hypertension and T2D). However, the

114

committee found few studies that have systematically quantified the dose–response relations

115

between physical activity levels and mortality end-points in people with preexisting NCDs.

116

Accordingly, their report concludes that dose–response relationships cannot yet be defined for

117

adults with NCDs as a result of the limited information available.[9] Overall, it is unclear

118

whether mortality rates in individuals with NCDs are affected by physical activity in the same

119

way as mortality rates in the general population.

120

Thus, the objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review and dose–response meta-

121

analysis of physical activity and mortality in people with selected NCDs. We aimed to define

122

the dose–response relationship between post-diagnosis physical activity and mortality rates

123

for nine NCDs with a high global burden of disease,[10] including low back pain, T2D,

124

osteoarthritis, depressive disorder, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), breast

125

cancer, lung cancer, stroke and ischemic heart disease (IHD).

126
127

METHODS

128

The method for this systematic review and meta-analysis was predefined in a published study

129

protocol,[11] and registered at PROSPERO – the International Prospective Register of

130

Systematic Reviews (registration number: CRD42018103357; available online at

131

https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=103357 ). This

132

systematic review and meta-analysis is reported in compliance with the Preferred Reporting

133

Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Statement for Reporting

134

Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (see Supplementary File 1).[12]

135
136

Search and data sources

137

A systematic search was conducted of PubMed, Scopus and the Web of Science from their

138

inception to August 2018. This search was followed by a hand-search of the citations in the

139

detected articles. The search was updated in August 2019 by using the forward citation search

140

in Google Scholar for the articles that qualified for inclusion (see Supplementary File 2).

142

Study selection

143

The eligibility criteria required the population to consist of adults with a physician-confirmed

144

or self-reported diagnosis of one of the nine NCDs (osteoarthritis, low back pain, depressive

145

disorder, IHD, T2D, stroke, COPD, lung cancer or breast cancer). Studies that investigated

146

the association between physical activity and all-cause mortality as the primary outcome or

147

any other indication-specific mortality as a primary or secondary outcome were included. For

148

the dose–response meta-analysis, at least three categories of the exposure (i.e. physical

149

activity) had to be reported in the original study. The eligible study design was that of a

150

prospective observational nature. Non-English-language records, studies conducted on non-

151

human subjects and duplicate data sets were not considered. No limit on publication year was

152

imposed.

153

First, the literature identified through the electronic search was primarily assessed for

154

eligibility by inspecting the titles and abstracts. We decided to divide the literature between

155

three reviewers because of the large number of hits. Two additional reviewers were appointed

156

to ensure the quality of the first screening process. In the second step, the full texts of the

157

qualified studies were retrieved and critically evaluated for their final inclusion in the data

158

collection process. The three reviewers independently assessed the articles for eligibility, and

159

any discrepancies were resolved by discussions and when necessary, by adjudication from

160

another reviewer.

161
162

Data collection and items

163

The following details were extracted from the included publications: first author, year of

164

publication, study name, design, country, mean follow-up time, total sample size, age, sex,

165

mortality cases in total and per physical activity category, exposure categories, diagnosis and

166

mortality ascertainment, relative risks and corresponding 95% CIs of the multivariate-

167

adjusted models. Thirteen authors of the selected studies were contacted for additional data on

168

physical activity. However the original data from two authors did not allow for an estimation

169

of physical activity levels in MET-h/week (meaning that these studies were excluded), and

170

two authors provided information on physical activity dosage.[13, 14]

171
172

Risk of bias in individual studies

173

The Cochrane tool for assessing the “Risk Of Bias In Non-randomised Studies - of

174

Interventions” (ROBINS-I) was used to estimate the risk of bias and endorse conclusions

175

closer to the truth.[15] The tool includes seven domains that lead to the risk of bias. These

176

domains are due to 1) confounding, 2) selection of participants, 3) exposure assessment, 4)

177

misclassification during follow-up, 5) missing data, 6) measurement of the outcome, and 7)

178

selective reporting of results. The included studies were independently evaluated by two

179

assessors (EM, LM). Any inconsistencies in the evaluations were documented and then

180

discussed with a third member of the research team (WG) and resolved by mutual agreement.

181
182

Statistical analysis

183

The meta-analysis was performed using Stata statistical software (Version 15, StataCorp,

184

College Station, TX, US). We pooled aggregated data using the random effects meta-

185

regression model, as suggested by DerSimonian and Laird,[16] assuming random variance of

186

the true effect of physical activity among studies, especially due to diversity in assessment

187

methods. For studies that reported results from one cohort in stratified estimates (e.g.

188

separately for men and women), a fixed effect model was used to combine the effects for the

189

whole cohort and include it in the meta-analysis. We conducted the linear dose–response

190

association between physical activity per 10 MET-h/week and all-cause mortality via the

191

method used by Greenland and Longnecker and presented via forest plots.[17, 18] For this

192

analysis, the number of cases and person-years, the quantification of the exposure and RRs

193

with the corresponding 95% CIs of at least three categories were needed. If information was

194

missing, the distributions of cases and person-years were estimated using the total number of

195

cases and the total number of participants plus the follow-up period, as previously

196

described.[19] If the lowest category was not used as a reference, the reported risk estimates

197

were recalculated using Orsini et al.’s[20] method to ensure comparability. The data on the

198

volume of physical activity were converted into a unit of MET-h/week. If a study reported the

199

exposure categories as ranges, then for each category, the midpoint between the lower and

200

upper limit was calculated. For open categories, we assumed that the width was the same as

201

the adjacent category. A potential non-linear association was evaluated using a restricted

202

cubic spline model with three knots at the 10th, 50th and 90th percentile of frequency of the

203

exposure.[18] The indication of nonlinearity was tested using a likelihood ratio test.

204

The heterogeneity was described using the measure of inconsistency (I2), and tau2 was used to

205

measure the variance between the included studies.[21] A subgroup analysis and meta-

206

regression were performed to explore the heterogeneity across studies. The analyses were

207

stratified by demographic variables (age, geographic area), follow-up duration (< 10 and ≥10

208

years), death cases (<100, 100–500 and ≥ 500), method of physical activity assessment

209

(questionnaire and interview), risk of bias (moderate and serious) and additional disease7

210

specific relevant factors (e.g. menopausal status in breast cancer). Publication bias was

211

investigated through various visual and statistical tools, including funnel plots and Egger’s

212

test for small-study effects, where asymmetry with a significance level of p < 0.1 suggests

213

publication bias.[22, 23]

214
215

RESULTS

216

The systematic database search yielded 44,518 publications in total. Three additional studies

217

were identified from the reference lists. Full texts were retrieved and screened for 183 articles

218

with the potential for inclusion. Twenty-eight studies satisfied the inclusion criteria for only

219

four out of the nine NCDs; breast cancer (n = 12), T2D (n = 6), IHD (n = 8) and COPD (n =

220

2) (see Figure 1 for a detailed flow diagram).

221
222

Study characteristics

223

The 28 included studies were all published during the past two decades and based in

224

numerous countries throughout the world. All the included studies had a prospective

225

observational design. More specifically, there were 25 cohort studies that included two

226

prospective cohort follow-ups to case-control studies as well as three follow-up studies of

227

RCTs.[13, 24, 25] The sample sizes varied considerably from 435[26] to 15,645[27], with a

228

total of 27,248 participants diagnosed with breast cancer, 32,221 with T2D, 4,784 with COPD

229

and 42,027 with IHD.

230

<< Figure 1 >>

231

The follow-up duration ranged from 3.3[28] years to 18.4 years.[29] A summary of the main

232

characteristics of the cohorts is displayed in Table 1. All-cause mortality was reported as the

233

primary outcome in all included studies. Other reported outcomes were breast cancer

234

mortality, recurrence and new primary events, cardiovascular disease mortality, IHD mortality

235

and respiratory mortality. All exposure assessments of physical activity were based on self- or

236

interviewer-administered questionnaires. The time from diagnosis to physical activity

237

measurement varied from three to six months post-diagnosis[30]. The longest follow-up was

238

14 years.[31] Detailed information on the measurement instruments for physical activity

239

assessment can be found in Supplementary File 3. Exposure categories were presented as the

240

volume of physical activity in MET-h/week[14, 24–28, 32–44] calorie expenditure,[45]

241

duration of physical activity,[46] frequency of physical activity[47] and nominal

242

categories.[13, 29–31, 48, 49]

Risk of bias in included studies

263

In terms of the seven domains of ROBINS-I, no study had a low risk of bias. From the 28

264

publications assessed, 11 were evaluated to have a moderate risk of bias,[13, 24, 26, 28, 30,

265

31, 34, 35, 38, 45, 48] and the remaining studies had a serious risk of bias. The main domains

266

that introduced bias were the confounding domain and the domain of deviations from

267

intended interventions. It is important to note that due to the assessment of physical activity

268

based on self-reports, a potential misclassification of physical activity could not be excluded.

269

Therefore, 82% of the studies were rated with an unknown risk of bias in the domain of the

270

classification of physical activity. The risk of bias for each domain in the 28 studies is shown

271

in Figure 2. In addition, Table 1 contains the final risk of bias evaluation across the studies,

272

and Supplementary File 4 includes the detailed results of the risk of bias assessment.

Post-diagnosis physical activity and all-cause mortality

277

We examined the relationship between post-diagnosis physical activity and all-cause

278

mortality in breast cancer, T2D, IHD and COPD populations. The results of the linear dose–

279

response meta-analyses are presented in Figure 3. Physical activity was associated with lower

280

mortality rates in persons with breast cancer, T2D, COPD and IHD. For every 10 MET-h

281

increase of physical activity per week, the summary hazard ratio (SHR) decreased by 22% in

282

people with breast cancer (HR, 0.78; 95% CI: 0.71, 0.86), by 12 % in people with IHD (HR,

283

0.88; 95% CI: 0.83, 0.93) and by 30% in people with COPD (HR, 0.70; 95% CI: 0.45, 1.09).

284

The mortality rates in people with T2D reduced by 4% for every 10 MET-h/week (HR, 0.96;

285

95% CI: 0.93, 0.99). Ten MET-hours/week is equivalent to 180 minutes of walking or 86

286

minutes of running.[50]

287

There was evidence of high heterogeneity between the included studies for all the target

288

groups, specifically breast cancer (I2 = 90.1%), T2D (I2 = 72.7 %), IHD (I2 = 86.5%) and

289

COPD (I2 = 94.0%). The subgroup analysis for breast cancer (Supplementary File 6, Table

290

S6.1) highlighted that the subgroup difference is statistically significant (p = 0.018) for the

291

follow-up variable only, meaning that the length of follow up can modify the observed

292

associations between physical activity and mortality. None of the other included variables

293

(age, geographic area, death cases, method of physical activity assessment, risk of bias,

294

menopausal status in breast cancer) explained the amount of between-study variance (p >

295

0.05).

296

The funnel plot for breast cancer as well as T2D did not suggest the presence of publication

297

bias, and Egger’s test confirmed that there was no apparent evidence of bias. However, the

298

funnel plot for IHD studies was asymmetrical, and the test for small-study effects evidenced

299

that publication bias could be present (p < 0.001) (Supplementary File 5). This should be

300

interpreted with caution, however, as only eight studies were included in the funnel plot, and

301

the statistical tests for publication bias are criticised for having low power.[51, 52]

302

Furthermore, it should be noted that studies with smaller sample sizes[13, 30, 31, 47] have

303

reported higher beneficial effects of physical activity. Thus, the detected asymmetry could be

304

related to high heterogeneity.

Figure 4 presents the non-linear dose–response meta-analysis among the four NCD

309

populations. The results for breast cancer (n = 12), T2D (n = 6), IHD (n = 8) as well as COPD

310

(n = 2) indicated a non-linear dose–response relationship between post-diagnosis physical

311

activity presented in MET-h/week and all-cause mortality (p for non-linearity < 0.001).

312

The curves for breast cancer, T2D and IHD show the steepest drop between 0 MET-h/week

313

and 20 MET-h/week; the COPD curve drops more markedly between 0 and 10 MET-h/week.

314

After this, the curves flatten out. For diabetes and COPD, significantly higher physical

315

activity levels (up to around 90 MET-h/week) are also associated with further positive effects

316

on mortality rates. For breast cancer, there appears a plateau with no additional effects on

317

mortality with more than 45 MET-h/week. For COPD, the curve can only be calculated up to

318

30 MET-h/week.

DISCUSSION

323

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, higher levels of post-diagnosis physical activity

324

were associated with a reduction in all-cause mortality in adults with breast cancer, T2D, IHD

325

and COPD. Our dose–response meta-analysis highlights a non-linear association between

326

physical activity levels and mortality characterized by (1) no threshold for the beneficial

327

effect of physical activity on mortality (i.e. even low levels of physical activity are beneficial

328

for mortality rates compared to being physically inactive), (2) a non-linear curve, where the

329

greatest difference in mortality rates occurs among inactive compared to minimally active

330

individuals and (3) for higher physical activity levels, the dose–response curves flatten out.

331

The subgroup meta-analysis showed that longer follow-ups (≥10 years) lead to higher

332

reductions of SHR. Although the effect size is higher for follow-ups that are 10 years or

333

longer, there is an unexplained heterogeneity between the effects of physical activity within

334

each subgroup. However, the unbalanced distribution of studies and the low overall number

335

of studies for some subgroups make the interpretation difficult. Hence, it is uncertain whether

336

the length of follow-up can explain the heterogeneity in the effect size. The reduction in

337

mortality rates from physical activity were consistent and much the same after controlling for

338

geographic areas (Asia, Europe, US, other), age (<60 years; ≥60 years), number of cases

339

(<100, 100–500) and the risk of bias (moderate; serious). Due to a lack of studies, we were

340

not able to determine dose–response relationships for physical activity and mortality in adults

341

with low back pain, osteoarthritis, depressive disorder, lung cancer or stroke.

342
343

Comparison with other studies

344

Our findings confirm previous linear meta-analyses, which showed a general correlation

345

between higher physical activity levels and lower mortality rates in adults with T2D[6] and

346

breast cancer.[7] Our linear meta-analysis reveals reductions of SHR per 10 MET-h/week that

347

vary between the four NCDs. The lowest SHR reduction in our results was found in T2D

348

(4%) – a somewhat lower effect than the 9.5% reduction per one MET-h/day reported by

349

Kodama et al.[6] We found medium reductions in IHD (12%) and breast cancer (22%) and

350

the highest SHR reductions in COPD (30%). Our applied non-linear dose–response-analysis

351

extends and refines these previous linear analyses. The associations between different post-

352

diagnosis physical activity levels and mortality for adults with NCDs are very similar to those

353

recently developed for the general population.[9, 53, 54] Therefore, our results confirm the

354

following main characteristics of the dose–response curves in the general population for

355

adults with selected NCDs: (1) no threshold for the positive effect, (2) the most pronounced

356

SHR reductions occurs between adults with little physical activity compared to those being

357

physically inactive and (3) no negative effects on mortality at higher volumes of physical

358

activity.

359

For higher volumes of physical activity equivalent to an energy expenditure of more than five

360

times the weekly recommended moderate-intensity physical activity of 150 minutes and more,

361

the dose–response curve is less clearly defined. The dose–response curves of the US Physical

362

Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee[9] does not include physical activity levels of more

363

than 30 MET-hours/week. Ekelund et al.[54] include higher volumes of physical activity,

364

stating that the maximal reductions in SHR were seen at about 24 min/day of moderate to

365

vigorous physical activity or 375 min/day of light intensity; higher volumes of physical

366

activity are associated with a slight reduction in their benefit on mortality rates. In our study,

367

higher physical activity levels were associated with continuously small declines in mortality

368

rates for IHD and T2D. For breast cancer, there is a point of maximum reduction of SHR at

369

55 MET h/week with no additional benefits for higher physical activity levels. No data is

370

available on higher physical activity levels for COPD.

371

In the total population, 70% of the maximum effect on mortality risk reduction is achieved at

372

an energy consumption of 8.25 MET-h/week (equivalent to meeting the physical activity

373

recommendations of 150 weekly minutes).[9] Our results indicate that in adults with NCDs,

374

this energy consumption is associated with about 40% of the maximum achievable reduction

375

in mortality rates. Physical activity and both overall and cardiovascular mortality after stroke

376

were connected through a dose–response relationship where 10 MET-h/day of physical

377

activity produced 35–46% reductions in SHR.[39] Although one study reported data on stroke

378

patients,[39] it was not sufficient to be included in the meta-analysis. For 4 NCDs (low back

379

pain, osteoarthritis, depressive disorder, lung cancer), we were not able to find appropriate

380

studies for our analysis. Thus, our findings confirm the research gap in the clinical

381

populations already identified before.[9]

382
383

Strengths and limitations

384

Our study has several strengths. Its main strength is the broad and comprehensive systematic

385

literature search for 9 NCDs that has a high relevance for public health. For the first time, our

386

work generates a broad overview of post-diagnosis physical activity and mortality for adults

387

with NCDs. Another strength is the applied non-linear dose–response meta-analysis that

388

enables precise statements regarding the effective dose of physical activity for reduced

389

mortality rates. This information helps with the adaption or development of exercise

390

recommendations for adults with NCDs. In addition, the use of the new Robins-I tool is a

391

methodological strength that allows for a precise estimation of the risk of bias in different

392

domains (e.g. bias in the measurement outcome, due to missing outcome data or due to

393

deviation from intended interventions).

394

Despite its strengths, this systematic review and meta-analysis has limitations that should be

395

acknowledged. First, at the outcome level of the study, the risk of bias in the measurement of

396

physical activity in the original studies is unknown. All studies measured physical activity

397

398

prone to over-reporting of one’s physical activity levels.[55] Most of the studies have

399

measured the level of physical activity only at one point in time, thus meaning that no

400

information on changes over time is available. Moreover, different cut-off points were used

401

by the single studies to classify the participants’ levels of physical activity. This might lower

402

the accuracy of the dose–response curves. If the over-reporting of physical activity already

403

plays a role at low physical activity levels, the actual high relative reduction in mortality rates

404

of somewhat physically active persons compared to inactive persons could be underestimated.

405

Second, at the study level, our findings are susceptible to bias derived from studies of an

406

observational nature. Prospective observational cohort studies fail to provide conclusive

407

evidence of a causal relationship between physical activity and mortality.[56, 57] Our results

408

might be affected by reverse causality, as patients may tend to adjust their physical activity

409

level according to the disease severity and prognosis. Consequently, our analysis of cohort

410

studies does not provide a conclusive answer as to whether the reported dose–response

411

relationships between physical activity and mortality are actually causal or only correlative.

412

According to Hill,[58] however, our results increase the sense of confidence in a causal

413

relationship because they display (1) a clear dose–response curve, (2) a strong association or

414

high effect size and (3) consistent results in different studies. Third, at the review level and as

415

reported in the study protocol,[11] we did not consider the potential differences between

416

different physical activity intensities (i.e. light vs moderate vs vigorous), between physical

417

activity in different contexts (e.g. leisure time physical activity vs occupational physical

418

activity) or the interaction between physical activity and sedentary behaviour. Furthermore,

419

our analysis is likely to be affected by small-study effects and the small number of original

420

studies available for the sensitivity analysis.

421
422

Implications and future research

423

Assuming causality, our findings have implications for adults with NCDs, physicians and

424

other health professionals involved in physical activity promotion and exercise therapy, as

425

well as healthcare decisionmakers and policymakers. First, our results bear importance for

426

policymakers and those involved in public health issues. The results highlight the importance

427

of a physically active lifestyle and support strategies to promote physical activity (e.g. the

428

World Health Organization’s Global Action Plan on Physical Activity).[59] Second, for those

429

creating physical activity guidelines, our findings may inform developments or updates on

430

physical activity recommendations for adults with NCDs. Our findings reinforce low-dose

431

physical activity recommendations that clearly demonstrate there is no minimum dose of

432

physical activity and that effects on longevity occur at a volume of physical activity

433

significantly below the recommended minimum dose of 150 minutes per week.[60] The “+10

434

minutes of physical activity per day” from Japan[61] or the “Every Step Counts” message

435

from Germany[62] might be more feasible and efficient physical activity recommendations.

436

Third, for physicians, our results illustrate the medical potential of exercise as medicine and

437

encourage initiatives to anchor assess to and promotion of physical activity in routine medical

438

care.[63] Fourth, for health professionals in the field of physical activity promotion, our

439

results could lead to new targets for health-enhancing physical activity. Adults with NCDs are

440

often rather physically inactive[64] and experience various barriers to physical activity,

441

including time constraints and personal doubts about being able to participate in regular

442

physical activity.[65–67] Completing at least 150 minutes of physical activity per week is

443

considered by many to be overwhelming and unachievable. For adults with NCDs, non-

444

threshold-based, low-dose physical activity recommendations could be effective while also

445

being encouraging and easier to implement. Thus, low-dose physical activity

446

recommendations would destroy many barriers in relation to an active lifestyle and increase

447

the probability of success of interventions that promote physical activity.

448

The results also bear implications for future research. We identified a research gap: For 4 out

449

of 9 NCDs (lung cancer, depressive disorder, lung cancer, low back pain), there were no

450

eligible studies available. Since the associations for post-diagnosis physical activity and

451

mortality in adults with NCDs and the total population are different,[68] future research

452

should either conduct cohort studies on adults with NCDs or make a differentiation in the

453

analysis of the total population between healthy people and those with an existing NCD.

454

Furthermore, based on the considerable analyses of Ekelund et al.[54] in the overall

455

population, future analyses for adults with NCDs should also consider different intensities and

456

types of physical activity as well as the interaction between sedentary behaviour and physical

457

activity. Finally, future studies should apply more reliable device-based assessments of

458

physical activity instead of questionnaires that are prone to over-reporting.

459
460

CONCLUSION

461

In conclusion, our systematic review and meta-analysis provides evidence that higher levels

462

of physical activity are associated with lower mortality rates in adults with T2D, IHD, breast

463

cancer, or COPD. The shape of the dose-response curves are characterized by no threshold for

464

the beneficial effect of physical activity on mortality, and a regressive, non-linear dose-

465

response pattern where the greatest difference in mortality rates occurs among inactive

compared to minimally active individuals. There is no minimum dose of physical activity for

467

life prolongation. Less physical activity than the recommended 150 min a week has life

468

expectancy benefits for adults with a NCD. Our results encourage the development of low-

469

dose physical activity recommendations for adults with NCDs.
