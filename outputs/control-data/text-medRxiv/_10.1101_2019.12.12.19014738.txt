Temporal trends in public mass shootings: high-capacity magazines
significantly increase fatality counts, and are becoming more prevalent
Abstract
Background: There has been disagreement in the literature regarding whether public mass
shootings are becoming more frequent, or more deadly, and whether high-capacity magazine
(HCM) weaponry is associated with increased fatalities.
Objective: We examined the 85 non-felony- and non-gang-related mass shootings with at least
four people shot and killed that occurred in public places between 1995 to 2018 to examine the
frequency and deadliness of public mass shootings, as well as the role of HCM weaponry in
fatalities.
Findings: The per-capita rate of public mass shootings with at least four people killed has not
significantly increased since 1995 (Negative Binomial linear regression p=0.20), but public mass
shootings with at least six people killed have been increasing by 6.9% per year (p=0.01). Public
mass shootings are becoming significantly more deadly, with fatalities per incident increasing
by 4.5% per year (truncated Negative Binomial log-linear regression p<0.001).
Use of HCM weaponry banned during the 1994 to 2004 Federal Assault Weapons Ban (FAWB)
increased fatality counts on average by 1.9 times, and total number shot by 3.3 times (nonparametric bootstrap comparison of means (NPBCM), p < 0.001 in both cases). In these
incidents, HCM pistols were as deadly as assault rifles. The fraction of firearms involving HCMs

used by perpetrators more than doubled after the lapse of the federal ban, from 25% during
the ban to 59% after (Binomial factor regression, p<0.001).
Our online visual analytics application, https://mass-shootinganalytics.shinyapps.io/mass_shootings/, allows interested parties to examine and download
our data, replicate our analysis results and explore the analysis with alternate selections.
Policy recommendations: A re-instatement of the federal ban on high-capacity magazines in
pistols and rifles, or special taxes on such weaponry, may reduce public mass shooting fatalities.

Introduction
High-fatality public mass shootings are a rare form of firearm violence, but occur more often in
the US than in any other developed country (Lankford, 2016, 2019) . Previous analyses have
noted that mass shootings are more likely than other types of firearm violence to receive
national media attention (Duwe, 2000; Silva & Capellan, 2019). Massacres that occur in public
places, particularly those that are seemingly random events perpetrated by a stranger to the
victims, tend to capture the attention of the public, often provoking feelings within the public
audience of “that could have been me” (Petee, Padgett, & York, 1997; Wayment, 2004). Such
events often trigger vigorous public debate about policies that address all of the problems of
firearm violence (Barry, McGinty, Vernick, & Webster, 2013; Bowers, Holmes, & Rhom, 2010;
Krouse & Richardson, 2015). Unfortunately, such debate is often based on partisan rhetoric
instead of evidence-based research (Cook & Goss, 2014).
While much has been written on the subject of mass shootings [e.g. (Duwe, 2007; Fox,
Levin, & Fridel, 2018; Klarevas, 2016)], there has been a remarkable dearth of peer-reviewed,
non-partisan statistical analyses of the dynamics that underlie the frequency and casualtycounts of such events, perhaps due to what has amounted to an effective Congressional
moratorium on funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for studies of
firearm violence, in place since 1996 (Kellermann & Rivara, 2013; Winker, Abbasi, & Rivara,
2016). The few analyses that have been performed often disagree on various aspects of mass
shootings (Cohen, Azrael, & Miller, 2014; Klarevas, Conner, & Hemenway, 2019; Lankford &
Tomek, 2018; Towers, Gomez-Lievano, Khan, Mubayi, & Castillo-Chavez, 2015; Towers, Mubayi,

& Castillo-Chavez, 2018), including whether the frequency of such events has been increasing
(Cohen et al., 2014; Lott, 2015), and/or whether certain types of weaponry, like assault rifles,
play a significant role in casualty counts (Kleck, 2016; Lemieux, 2014). Poorly executed
statistical analyses and non-transparency in data selection have appeared to play a role in some
of the disagreements (Towers et al., 2018); indeed, a recent study by RAND researchers has
noted a lack of statistical rigor in many analyses of firearm violence (Schell, Griffin, & Morral,
2018).
To examine the frequency and deadliness of public mass shootings, as well as the role of
HCM weaponry in fatalities, we focused on mass shooting incidents with at least four people
shot and killed (not including the perpetrator) that occurred in public places; victims shot and
killed in private homes or on private land were not included in the tally of fatalities.
Additionally, the Federal Assault Weapons Ban (FAWB) that was in effect from September 13,
1994 to September 13, 2004, and its subsequent lapse, might plausibly have had an effect on
the types of weapons used in mass shootings (Koper & Roth, 2001; Koper, Woods, & Roth,
2004), which may also have impacted the number of fatalities per incident. We thus examined
public mass shooting events from the beginning of the FAWB to the end of 2018, and examined
whether the fraction of events that involved weaponry that had been banned during the FAWB
differed significantly during versus after the ban and whether the number killed in each event
was related to whether or not such weaponry was used.

2 Methods and Materials
2.1 Data

No complete and comprehensive official database of US public mass shootings currently exists.
Previous researchers have often relied on incomplete government databases, or databases
compiled by unofficial sources such as USA Today and Mother Jones (Fox & Fridel, 2016). Like
other researchers, we have found various compilations of public mass shootings often to be
incomplete or have errors in the event details, and/or have apparent inconsistencies in criteria
for inclusion (Fox & Levin, 2015; Huff-Corzine et al., 2014; Klarevas, 2016; Towers et al., 2015).
In our analysis we have attempted to rectify this problem by compiling a comprehensive list of
all high-fatality public mass shootings in the United States from 1995 onward that satisfy a welldefined set of criteria.
To begin, we define “mass murder” according to the 2010 Federal Bureau of
Investigation (FBI) criteria of four or more killed (Huff-Corzine et al., 2014), since it is these highfatality count events which are most likely to receive widespread media attention, and foment
debate on potential changes to state and federal policies to address the overall problem of
firearm violence in the US (Duwe, 2000; Silva & Capellan, 2019).
Events included in our analysis may have had multiple perpetrators, and may have
occurred in multiple public locations, but must have occurred within a 24-hour period to be
included. Shootings related to gang violence or other criminal activity were excluded, as were
shootings that could plausibly have been incited for reasons of self-defense, and shootings that
began with a police encounter during a traffic stop precipitated by suspicion of illegal activity.
Only events with at least four people shot and killed in public places (the four fatalities did not
include the perpetrator) were included; victims killed during the incident on private property

were not included in the fatality counts. We also only counted as fatalities victims who died
within one month of the incident, because it is the initial fatality count that primarily captures
the public attention.
As detailed in Appendix A, sources of information used in this analysis included the FBI
Supplementary Homicide Reports, along with many past print and online compilations of mass
shootings collected by researchers and various public and private organizations. From these
sources of data, events were selected that fit our definition of high-fatality public mass
shootings. While there was significant overlap in many of the past compilations of mass
shootings, events were often included in some compilations that were not included in others, in
part due to differing inclusion criteria in the compilations (Klarevas, 2016). However, we also
found several instances where events should have likely been included in some compilations
(according to the stated event inclusion criteria) but were excluded without explanation as to
why, and it is unclear whether the exclusion was deliberate, or instead due to ignorance of the
incident on the part of the researchers compiling the list.
To avoid this confusion with our database, we created a secondary database of events
that have been listed as “public mass shootings” in some past compilations, but did not meet
the criteria for inclusion in our primary database (because, for example, all or most of the
people killed were killed in private homes rather than public places, or only some of the victims
were killed by firearms). An example of an event typically tallied as a “public mass shooting” by
several past compilations, but was excluded in ours, is the September 2, 2008 incident in Alger,
WA, where the perpetrator killed five people in private homes, then shot and killed one other

person during a subsequent public shooting spree. We included such events in our secondary
database, with explanation as to the specific criteria each event did not meet for inclusion in
the primary data. In our online visual analytics application, available at https://mass-shootinganalytics.shinyapps.io/mass_shootings/, we allow the user to repeat our analyses with the
option to specifically include or exclude certain events. The visual analytics application also
contains an extensive set of links to online material that were used as sources of information
related to each event.
We selected incidents from the beginning of the FAWB on September 13, 1994 to the
end of December 2018. However, because no incidents meeting our criteria occurred from
September 13, 1994 to the end of 1994, the data selection effectively is for events between
1995 to 2018. We found 85 public mass shootings.
For each incident, we examined media reports, court documents, and other
documentation to determine the number and types of weapons used, including whether
weaponry banned during the FAWB was among the weaponry used, such as high-capacity
magazines carrying more than ten rounds of ammunition (used in either a rifle or pistol), or an
“assault rifle”. We use the definition of assault rifle specified in the FAWB legislation, which are
semi-automatic rifles with a detachable magazine that possess two or more of the following
features; folding or telescoping stock, pistol grip, bayonet mount, flash suppressor or threaded
barrel, or grenade launcher (see https://bit.ly/2U6dvOS, accessed November, 2019). For 77
(90.6%) incidents we were able to determine whether or not such weaponry was used.

2.2 Statistical methods
2.2.1 Temporal trends in frequency of incidents
Mass shooting events, per-capita, are rare, and thus Ordinary or Generalized Least
Squares methods are inappropriate for analyses of the trends in the frequency of such events
(Gardner, Mulvey, & Shaw, 1995). Also, when analyzing the temporal trends in the frequency of
mass shootings over a long time period, the effect of population change must be taken into
account (for example, everything else being equal, doubling the population size will double the
frequency of mass shootings). In addition, binning of data into a relatively long time period, like
a year, necessitates loss of information and reduces sensitivity of the analysis (Towers et al.,
2018). In this analysis, we thus performed an un-binned likelihood fit to the data (beyond the
necessary binning of data into integer days), and examined the temporal change in the percapita number of mass shootings per day, 𝜆⁄𝑁, where 𝑁 is the population size, and 𝜆 is the
average number per day. We employed a population-standardized log-linear model (Osgood,
2000), with the predicted number per day, λ, described as log 𝜆 = log 𝑁 + 𝛽/ + 𝛽0 𝑡,
where 𝑡 is the date. To account for potential over-dispersion in the count data involved in our
analyses, we used a Negative Binomial likelihood fit (Lloyd-Smith, 2007).
2.2.2 Temporal trends in fatalities per incident
The number of fatalities per incident is integer count data, and Least Squares methods
are again not appropriate for statistical analyses of such data because they are often highly
non-Normal and skewed (Osgood, 2000). While some previous analyses have used Poisson

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014738; this version posted December 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this

regression methods to analyze mass shooting fatalities (e.g. Gius, 2015, 2018), this does not
take into account the gross over-dispersion in the distribution of fatalities, and can thus lead to
over-estimation of the statistical power of the analysis. Negative Binomial likelihood methods
are more appropriate for over-dispersed count data (Lloyd-Smith, 2007), but in an analysis like
ours the model must also account for the fact that the data are truncated by the selection of
the minimum number killed in order to enter the sample (in the case of this analysis, four). As
described in Appendix A in the supplementary material, we employed a Negative Binomial
likelihood fit with the number killed, k, left-truncated at k ≥ 4.
2.2.3 Comparison of the number of fatalities per incident for events that do, and do not,
involve weaponry banned during the FAWB
Because mass shootings are rare, and the number of fatalities per incident are integer data
truncated at k ≥ 4 fatalities, hypothesis tests based on assumptions of Normality, such as the
Student’s t-test are not appropriate for comparing the means of the distributions (Nair, 1941).
The sample sizes are also generally not large enough such that the Central Limit Theorem
applies, such that the means can be compared using the Z test. In addition, non-parametric
tests that compare distributions, such as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, are not appropriate in
the presence of ties (i.e., many overlapping identical values in the data sets) (Corder &
Foreman, 2014).
Here we relied on non-parametric bootstrapping methods to compare the means of
distributions of fatalities (Barber & Thompson, 2000; Mooney, Duval, & Duvall, 1993). For
events that do, and do not, involve weaponry banned during the FAWB, we drew 10,000

bootstrapped distributions, sampled with replacement from the original distributions. For each
sampled distribution we calculated the mean, and determined how often the mean of the
distribution of events that did not involve such weaponry was greater than the mean of the
distribution of events that did. This fraction forms the p-value for the one-sided comparison
test (Barber & Thompson, 2000; Mooney et al., 1993).

3 Results
3.1 Temporal trends in frequency of incidents
In Figure 1 we show the temporal trends in the per-capita rate of all public mass shootings for
selections of at least four, six, and eight killed, respectively. For the sample with ≥4 killed, there
is no significant linear trend in per-capita rate, but both the ≥6 and ≥8 killed samples show
significant increases in time in the per-capita rates of 6.9% and 13.6% per year, respectively
(population standardized Negative Binomial log-linear regression p-values p=0.01 and p=0.001,
respectively).
3.2 Temporal trends in fatalities per incident
During the FAWB there was an average of 5.2 fatalities per incident, compared to 9.3 after the
lapse of the FAWB (1.8 times higher, non-parametric bootstrap p<0.001) (Figure 1). There has
been a significant relative increase in the number of fatalities per incident of 4.5% per year
since 1995 (truncated Negative Binomial log-linear regression p-value p < 0.001).
There is no significant temporal trend in the number of fatalities in incidents that do not involve
HCM weaponry (truncated Negative Binomial log-linear regression p-value p=0.11).

3.3 Effect of weaponry types on the number of fatalities per incident
For the 77 out of 85 events for which the type of weaponry was known, the average
number of fatalities in the 23 events that did not involve HCM weaponry banned during the
FAWB (including high-capacity semiautomatic pistols) was 5.0. The 54 events that involved
HCM weaponry had on average 9.8 fatalities (1.9 times higher, non-parametric bootstrap
comparison of means p < 0.001) (Figure 2).
The difference in the means is not solely due to ultra-high fatality count events such as
the October 1, 2017 Las Vegas, NV massacre (58 fatalities) and the June 12, 2016 Orlando, FL
Pulse nightclub shooting (49 fatalities); excluding those two events from the incidents involving
HCM weaponry yielded an average of 8.1 fatalities (1.6 times higher, non-parametric bootstrap
comparison of means p < 0.001).
The difference in the total number shot (some of whom survived) is also significant. The
average number of people shot in the 23 events that did not involve HCM weaponry was 7.5,
compared to an average of 25.0 shot in events that involved HCM weaponry (3.3 times higher,
p < 0.001). Excluding the October 1, 2017 Las Vegas, NV massacre and the June 12, 2016
Orlando FL Pulse nightclub shootings yields an average of 14.8 people shot (2.0 times higher
compared to incidents perpetrated without HCM weaponry, p < 0.001).
Even just the use of high-capacity magazine pistols (and not an assault rifle) resulted in
significantly more fatalities on average compared to that involved no banned weaponry (1.6
times higher, non-parametric bootstrap comparison of means p<0.001) (Figure 2). Indeed,

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014738; this version posted December 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this

there was no significant difference in the number of fatalities between events for which the
banned weaponry only involved an assault rifle compared to events for which the banned
weaponry only involved a high-capacity semi-automatic pistol; 11.6 versus 8.0 killed on
average, respectively (non-parametric bootstrap comparison of means p=0.79).
The number of fatal victims was significantly associated with the number of HCM
firearms used in the incident (Negative Binomial linear regression p<0.001) [and was almost
significant with the number of non-HCM firearms (p=0.06)]. This conclusion held even when the
October 1, 2017 Las Vegas NV massacre was excluded. For incidents where only one firearm
was involved, the average number of fatalities in incidents with a non-HCM firearm was 4.6,
compared to 7.3 when an HCM firearm was used (non-parametric bootstrap comparison of
means p<0.001).
3.4 Trends in the use of weaponry banned during the FAWB
During the FAWB, 48% of the public mass shooting events involved weaponry banned
during the FAWB. After the lapse of the ban, 71% of such events involved weaponry that would
have been banned during the FAWB (p=0.05, Binomial factor regression).
The average number of weapons per incident was not significantly different during and
after the ban (2.2 versus 2.3 weapons per incident, non-parametric bootstrap comparison of
means p=0.46). However, the average number of weapons involving HCMs per incident rose
over two-fold, from an average of 0.6 during the ban, to 1.4 after the ban (non-parametric
bootstrap comparison of means p=0.002). The fraction of firearms involving HCMs used by

perpetrators also more than doubled after the lapse of the ban, from 25% during the ban to
59% after (Binomial factor regression, p<0.001). The significant differences remained even
when the October 1, 2017 Las Vegas, NV massacre was excluded from the data set.
The differences during- and post-ban appear to have been partly driven by a rising
popularity in use of high-capacity semiautomatic pistols by perpetrators. The average number
of assault rifles per incident was 0.2 during the ban, compared to 0.7 after (0.3, excluding the
October 1, 2017 Las Vegas NV massacre), non-parametric bootstrap comparison of means
p=0.09 (p=0.24). In contrast, the average number of high-capacity semi-automatic pistols per
incident during the ban was 0.3, compared to 0.6 post-ban (p=0.009). During the FAWB 13% of
firearms used where HCM pistols, compared to 28% after the lapse (p=0.031, Binomial factor
regression).

4 Discussion
In this analysis we employed rigorous statistical methodologies and well-defined
selection criteria to examine high-fatality public mass shootings in the US. We have made
efforts to ensure full transparency in our data selection criteria, and to make our data,
referenced sources of information, and analysis methodologies publicly available (see
https://mass-shooting-analytics.shinyapps.io/mass_shootings/). Our online interface to the
database of public mass shootings used in this analysis is extensively annotated with links to
external sources of information we used to determine event details, including whether
weaponry banned during the FAWB was used by the perpetrator(s).

In our data collection, we found that several sources of mass shooting data commonly
used by other researchers appeared to have errors, omissions, and inconsistencies—
highlighting the importance of cross-checking and validating information when using data
compiled by other investigators—on any issue.
In our analysis we focused on events with four or more people killed, since high-fatality
incidents are most likely to receive significant amounts of national media attention (Duwe,
2000; Silva & Capellan, 2019), and are most likely to foment changes to public policy (Fox &
DeLateur, 2014; Schildkraut & Elsass, 2016). Selecting events based on an arbitrary number of
fatalities has been criticized, since people who were wounded in an attack were clearly meant
to be killed by the perpetrator but instead managed to survive the attack (Capellan & Gomez,
2018; Lott & Landes, 2000). In addition, “thwarted” attacks, where the perpetrator apparently
meant to shoot many people but was prevented from doing so by some means (such as
bystander interference, for example) may provide information on whether or not various
potential intervention measures are actually efficacious. While it might be well motivated to
examine all shootings or attempted shootings, there may be biases in data selection and a lack
of details related to the events. Even the FBI Supplementary Homicide Reports are incomplete
in their details and in their tally of multiple-victim shootings (Huff-Corzine et al., 2014; Towers
et al., 2015). Researchers currently must rely on media reports and online documents to
attempt to fill in the gaps of the official record (Capellan & Gomez, 2018; Parkin & Gruenewald,
2017), and under-reporting by the media of low-fatality events can bias the detection efficiency
for such events (Duwe, Kovandzic, & Moody, 2002; Schildkraut, Elsass, & Meredith, 2018; Silva

& Capellan, 2019). In addition, the further back in time one goes, the more likely low-fatality
events will escape notice.
Indeed, in our analysis, after an exhaustive search of public mass shootings from 1995 to
2018, we found events in our data set with four people killed that had not been included in
tallies compiled by other researchers, indicating that lower-fatality incidents are likely easily
over-looked in data collection efforts.
Various definitions of ‘high-fatality’ mass shootings have been used in the literature,
with some researchers favoring a cutoff of even higher than four killed [e.g., (Klarevas, 2016;
Kleck, 2016)]. For transparency, our online visual analytics application allows everyone to
explore the trends in our data with more restrictive selections on the minimum number killed,
and/or excluding or including specific events (see https://mass-shootinganalytics.shinyapps.io/mass_shootings/).

regressing on time, we found that the per-capita rate of all public mass shootings with at least
four killed has not significantly increased since 1995 (2% average relative increase per year,
p=0.20), but the rate with six or more killed has (6.9% average relative increase per year,
p=0.011).
Our finding that per-capita rates of public mass shootings have not increased
significantly is in conflict with the results of a report (Cohen et al., 2014) using data from

Mother Jones. However, we find 64 public mass shootings satisfy our selection criteria from
1995 to the end of 2014, while Mother Jones counted only 50 incidents over the same time
period. Our findings are also different than (Krouse & Richardson, 2015), who examined public
mass shootings with four or more individuals killed between the years 1970 to 2014. However,
that analysis did not assess per-capita annual rates because it did not take into account the
change in the US population over that time period and did not test the null hypothesis of no
temporal trend in per-capita rates.
By contrast, our findings that the per-capita rates of very high-fatality incidents are
increasing is in qualitative agreement with the results of (Klarevas, 2016; Klarevas et al., 2019)
that examined mass shootings (not just public mass shootings) with six or more killed, and
found that in the ten year period after the lapse of the FAWB there was a 183% increase in the
rate of such massacres.
4.2 Temporal trends in fatalities per incident
We found that the number of fatalities per incident has significantly increased by 4.5%
per year (truncated Negative Binomial log-linear regression p-value p < 0.001), and that the
number of fatalities per incident was 1.8 times higher after the lapse of the FAWB than it was
during it (non-parametric bootstrap p<0.001). This is in qualitative agreement with the results
of both (DiMaggio et al., 2019) and (Klarevas, 2016).
4.3 Effect of weaponry types on the number of fatalities per incident

We found that the use of weaponry that had been banned during the FAWB significantly
increased fatality counts in public mass shootings; the average number of fatalities in the 31
events that did not involve such weaponry (or for which it was unknown whether such
weaponry was involved) was 4.8 while the 54 events that involved weaponry banned during the
FAWB (including high-capacity semiautomatic pistols) had on average 9.8 fatalities (2.0 times
higher, non-parametric bootstrap comparison of means p<0.001). The total number shot was
over 3 times higher in incidents that involved HCM weaponry (non-parametric bootstrap
comparison of means p<0.001).
This finding is in disagreement with the arm-chair reasoning of (Kleck, 2016) and (Fox &
Fridel, 2016) who pointed out that many mass shooters are armed with multiple weapons, so
high-capacity magazines would thus not likely make a difference since the shooter would not
have to stop to reload. We found that fatality counts were significantly associated with the
number of HCM weapons used, but were not significantly associated with the number of nonHCM weapons used. We also found that in incidents where only one firearm was used, the use
of a HCM firearm significantly increased fatality counts, by a factor of 1.6 times. Similiar to
(Klarevas et al., 2019), our findings highlight the importance of high capacity magazines as a
likely factor in increasing the number of deaths.
4.4 Trends in the use of weaponry banned during the FAWB
During the FAWB, 48% of all public mass shooting events involved HCM weaponry. After
the lapse of the ban, 71% of events involved such weaponry (p=0.047, Binomial factor
regression). These results are in contrast to the claim made by (Krouse & Richardson, 2015) that

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2019.12.12.19014738; this version posted December 15, 2019. The copyright holder for this

only 27% of assailants in public mass shootings between 1999 and 2013 used weaponry that
had been banned during the FAWB. Because (Krouse & Richardson, 2015) did not provide
incident-level details of the 66 events in their analysis. We thus could not determine where the
differences lie between their analysis and ours. We counted 51 public mass shooting events
over the same time period, and we were able to determine the types of weaponry used for 45
cases, 31 of which (69%) involved weaponry that had been banned during the FAWB.
Our results also lie in sharp contrast with the claim by (Kleck, 2016) that “less than one
third of 1%” of assailants in mass shootings used HCMs—a claim that was not substantiated by
any cited sources of data. Our results also contrast with the claim by (Duwe, 2007) that “only
2%” of mass murders are committed with an assault weapon. It is unclear how Duwe arrived at
this number, what time period was examined, how “mass murder” was defined in the analysis,
and how it was determined whether or not an assault weapon was used. Their definitions of
mass shootings are clearly very different from the one used in this paper; this again emphasizes
the need for researchers of mass killings to be more transparent in specifying their data
selection criteria.
The temporal trends we noted in the types of weaponry used in public mass shootings
mirror the trends noted by (Koper, Johnson, Nichols, Ayers, & Mullins, 2017) who found that
since the lapse of the FAWB high-capacity pistols and rifles are increasingly used in mass
murders and other types of crime.
Our finding that the increasing use of formerly banned weaponry is largely driven by a
increase in the popularity of high-capacity semi-automatic pistols among perpetrators, rather

than assault rifles, is in agreement with the findings of (Klarevas, 2016; Klarevas et al., 2019),
who found that the fraction of mass shootings involving six or more victims committed with an
assault rifle did not significantly change post-ban, but the use of pistols involving HCMs did.
5 Summary
In this analysis, we examined factors related to the fatality-counts in the 85 public mass
shooting incidents (4+ victims killed in a public place) that occurred in the United States
between 1995 to 2018. Our visual analytics application related to this analysis, https://massshooting-analytics.shinyapps.io/mass_shootings/ allows the public, policy stakeholders, and
other researchers to examine and download our data, and replicate our analysis results and
explore the analysis with alternate selections.
We found that the per capita rate of public mass shootings with at least four people
killed has not been significantly increasing since 1995, but that the incidents became
significantly more deadly. Like (Klarevas et al., 2019), we found that very high fatality incidents
are becoming more frequent; for example, incidents with more than 6 fatalities per event have
been increasing at close to 7% per year.
We also found that public mass shootings involving high capacity magazines are
becoming more common, that such shootings have higher fatality counts, and that an increase
in the use of HCM firearms followed the elimination of the federal assault weapons ban. Finally,
we found that HCM pistols have increased the fatality counts as much as HCM rifles, and that
prevalence of the use of high-capacity semi-automatic pistols in public mass shootings has

more than doubled since the lapse of the ban, while the prevalence of the use of assault rifles
has not significantly changed.
Our finding that the use of HCMs doubles the number of fatalities and more than triples
the total number of people shot in public mass shootings indicates that a re-instatement of the
federal ban on high-capacity magazines in pistols and rifles may reduce the fatalities in public
mass shootings. Alternatively, a high tax on the sales of such magazines may also be well
motivated.
