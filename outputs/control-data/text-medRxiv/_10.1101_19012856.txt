Abstract
Background: Information on influenza-associated mortality in Russia is limited and largely
related to deaths with influenza in the diagnosis that represent a small fraction of all
influenza-associated deaths.
Methods: Using previously developed methodology (Goldstein et al., Epidemiology 2012),
we regressed the monthly rates of mortality for respiratory causes, as well as circulatory
causes (available from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat)) during the
2013/14 through the 2018/19 influenza seasons linearly against the monthly proxies for
the incidence of influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B (obtained using data from the
Smorodintsev Research Institute of Influenza (RII) on influenza/ARI consultations, testing
of respiratory specimens and genetic/antigenic characterization of influenza viruses),
adjusting for the baseline rates of mortality not associated with influenza circulation and
temporal trends.
Results: For the 2013/14 through the 2018/19 seasons, influenza circulation was
associated with an average annual 17636 (95% CI (9482,25790)) deaths for circulatory
causes and 4179 (3250,5109) deaths for respiratory causes, with the largest number of
deaths (32298 (18071,46525) for circulatory causes and 6689 (5019,8359) for respiratory
causes) estimated during the 2014/15 influenza season. Influenza A/H3N2 was

responsible for 51.8% of all circulatory influenza-associated deaths and 37.2% of all
respiratory influenza-associated deaths. Influenza A/H1N1 was responsible for 23.4% of all
circulatory influenza-associated deaths and 29.5% of all respiratory influenza-associated
deaths. Influenza B was responsible for 24.9% of all circulatory influenza-associated deaths
and 33.3% of all respiratory influenza-associated deaths, with the overwhelming majority
of those deaths being caused by the B/Yamagata viruses. Compared to the 2013/14
through the 2015/16 seasons, during the 2016/17 through the 2018/19 seasons (when
levels of influenza vaccination were significantly higher), the volume of influenzaassociated mortality declined by about 16.1%, or 3809 annual respiratory and circulatory
deaths.
Conclusions: Influenza circulation is associated with a substantial mortality burden in
Russia, particularly for circulatory deaths, with some reduction in mortality rates observed
following the major increase in influenza vaccination coverage. Those results support the
potential utility of further extending the levels of influenza vaccination, the use of
quadrivalent influenza vaccines, and extra efforts for protecting individuals with
circulatory disease in Russia, including vaccination and the use of antiviral medications.

Introduction
Annual epidemics associated with the circulation of influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B take
place in Russia [1,2]. Such epidemics are known to result in a substantial toll of mortality in
other countries in the Northern Hemisphere, e.g. [3-9], including mortality for circulatory
causes [3,4], with influenza additionally known to be associated with a variety of
cardiovascular manifestations [10,11]. At the same time, there is limited information on the
burden of influenza-associated mortality in Russia. Such information is largely related to
deaths with influenza in the diagnosis, e.g. [2,12-15]. However, cases with influenza in the
diagnosis are known to represent only a small fraction of all influenza-associated deaths.
Additionally, cases with influenza in the diagnosis may not be representative of the relative
contribution of the major influenza (sub)types (A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and B) to mortality.

Indeed, the age distribution of diagnosed deaths with influenza A/H1N1 is significantly
younger compared to diagnosed deaths with influenza A/H3N2 and B in Russia, e.g. [13].
This suggests that deaths associated with A/H1N1 infections are much more likely to be
diagnosed compared to deaths associated with A/H3N2 and influenza B infections. Indeed,
even during the 2014/15 season when influenza A/H1N1 circulation was minimal,
influenza A/H1N1 was found to represent the largest contribution to diagnosed influenzarelated deaths in Russia [14,15]. All of this suggests that better understanding is needed of
the overall volume of influenza-related deaths in Russia, as well as of the relative
contribution of each of the major influenza (sub)types to mortality, including changes in
the above following the significant increase in influenza vaccination coverage starting the
2015/16 season.
In our earlier work [3,4,16], we introduced a new method for estimating the burden of
severe outcomes associated with influenza and the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV),
designed to address several limitations of some of the previously employed inference
models. An important feature of that approach is the use of RSV and influenza A/H3N2,
A/H1N1, and B incidence proxies that are expected to be linearly related to the population
incidence of those viruses; such proxies for influenza (sub)types combine data on medical
consultations for influenza-like illness (ILI) with data on the testing of respiratory
specimens from symptomatic individuals [3,4,16]. We’ve applied those incidence proxies to
estimate the rates of influenza-associated mortality stratified by age/cause of death in the
US [3,4], with the corresponding method being later adopted for the estimation of
influenza-associated mortality in other countries as well, e.g. [6-9]. In this paper, we derive
the analogous proxies for the weekly/monthly incidence of influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1,
and B in Russia based on the surveillance data from the Smorodintsev Research Institute of
Influenza (RII) [17,18] that includes information on medical consultations for
influenza/ARI symptoms, data on testing of respiratory specimensfor the different
influenza (sub)types, as well as data on the antigenic characterization of the circulating
influenza strains. We then apply the inference model from [3,4,16] to relate those incidence
proxies to the monthly data from the Russian Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat)
[19,20] on the rates of death for respiratory causes and circulatory causes to estimate the

corresponding mortality rates associated with the circulation of the major influenza
(sub)types during the 2013/14 through the 2018/19 influenza seasons in Russia.

Methods
Data
Monthly data on mortality for respiratory and circulatory causes of in Russia were
obtained from [19]. Monthly mortality counts for respiratory and circulatory deaths were
then converted to monthly rates of mortality for those causes per 100,000 individuals
using population data from Rosstat [20]. Influenza is known to be associated with mortality
for other causes as well, including neoplasms and metabolic diseases [3,4]; however finer
(e.g. weekly) mortality data are needed to ascertain the signals from influenza circulation
in the corresponding time series.
Weekly data on the rates of ILI/ARI consultation per 10,000 individuals in Russia are
available from [17] (where they are called the influenza/ARI rates). Data on the weekly
percent of respiratory specimens from symptomatic individuals that were RT-PCR positive
for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and influenza B are available from [18].
Incidence proxies
Only a fraction of individuals presenting with influenza/ARI symptoms are infected with
influenza. We multiplied the weekly rates of influenza/ARI consultation per 10,000
individuals [17] by the weekly percentages of respiratory specimens from symptomatic
individuals that were RT-PCR positive for each of influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B [18] to
estimate the weekly incidence proxies for each of the corresponding influenza (sub)types:

As noted in [3], those proxies are expected to be proportional to the weekly population
incidence for the each of the major influenza (sub)types (hence the name “proxy”). Monthly
incidence proxies for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B were obtained as the weighted
average of the weekly incidence proxies for those weeks that overlapped with a given
month; specifically, for each influenza (sub)type and month, the incidence proxy for each
week was multiplied by the number of days in that week that were part of the
corresponding month (e.g. 7 if the week was entirely within that month), then the results
were summed over the different weeks and divided by the number of days in the
corresponding month. To relate the incidence proxies for the major influenza (sub)types to
monthly mortality rates we first shift the incidence proxies by one week forward to
accommodate for the delay between infection and death [3,4], then use the shifted weekly
incidence proxies to obtain the corresponding monthly incidence proxies as above.
The relation between an incidence proxy and the associated mortality may change over
time. In particular, influenza B is characterized by the circulation of B/Yamagata and
B/Victoris viruses. It is known that the age distribution for the B/Yamagata infections is
notably older than for the B/Victoria infections [21,22]. Correspondingly, the relation
between the incidence proxy (which reflects influenza incidence in the general population)
and influenza-related mortality (which for influenza B largely reflects mortality in older
individuals) may be quite different for influenza B/Yamagata compared to influenza
B/Victoria. Influenza B/Yamagata dominated the influenza B circulation in Russia during
the 2013/14, 2014/15, 2017/18 and the 2018/19 seasons, while influenza B/Victoria was
dominant during the 2015/16 and the 2016/17 seasons [18]. Correspondingly, we split the
incidence proxy for influenza B into two: one for the 2013/14, 2014/15, 2017/18 and the
2018/19 seasons (called the B/Yamagata proxy), and one for the 2015/16 and the
2016/17 seasons (called the B/Victoria proxy). During the 2014/15 and the 2015/16
influenza seasons, a drift variant of influenza A/H3N2 with reduced titers to the vaccinetype strains circulated in Russia [18]; moreover this variant was known to cause high levels
of mortality in other countries [7]. During the other four seasons in our study, the
circulating A/H3N2 strains were similar to the vaccine-type strains. Correspondingly, we

split the A/H3N2 incidence proxy into two: one for the 2014/15 and the 2015/16 seasons
(called the drift A/H3N2 proxy), and one for the 2013/14, 2106/17, 2017/18 and the
2018/19 season (called the matching A/H3N2 proxy). Finally, we know that for all six
influenza seasons in the data, the majority of circulating influenza A/H1N1 viruses were
similar to the vaccine-type viruses during the corresponding seasons. Figure 1 plots the
monthly incidence proxies for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 and B in Russia between
07/2013 and 07/2019 (73 months), with the proxies for influenza A/H3N2 and B further
split into two as described in this paragraph.
Inference method
If 𝑀(𝑡) is the mortality rate for a given cause on month 𝑡 (with 𝑡 = 1 for 07/2013), and
𝐴/𝐻3𝑁2!"#$! (𝑡), 𝐴/𝐻3𝑁2!"#$% (𝑡), 𝐴/𝐻1𝑁1(𝑡), 𝐵/𝑉𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑎(𝑡), 𝐵/𝑌𝑎𝑚𝑎𝑔𝑎𝑡𝑎(𝑡) are the
incidence proxies for the different influenza (sub)types on month 𝑡 as described in the
previous subsection, then the inference model in [3,4] suggests that
𝑀 𝑡 = 𝛽! + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐴/𝐻3𝑁2!"#$! (𝑡) + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐴/𝐻3𝑁2!"#$% (𝑡) + 𝛽! ∙ 𝐴/𝐻1𝑁1(𝑡) + 𝛽! ∙

Here 𝐵𝑎𝑠𝑒𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑒 is the baseline rate of mortality not associated with influenza circulation
that is periodic with yearly periodicity. We will model it as

Here 𝐽𝑎𝑛 is a variable equaling 1 for the month of January, 0 otherwise. The reason for
including this variable is that the monthly (rather than annual) mortality data in [19] is
operational, with some of the mortality not registered during a given calendar year being
added to January on the next year [23]. Furthermore, the January effect (likely weatherrelated) on circulatory mortality in Russia was established in [24]. The (temporal) trend is
modeled as a cubic polynomial in time (month). Finally, the sensitivity of the estimates of

the contribution of influenza to mortality with regard to the model for the baseline is
discussed in the Supporting Information for [3] (where limited sensitivity was found).
The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is adopted to select the variables (covariates) in the
model in eq. 2 for each mortality cause, with the variable whose omission results in the
largest decline in the AIC score being dropped at each step until no omissions of a variable
decrease the AIC score. The model equations for respiratory mortality and circulatory
mortality selected by the stepwise AIC criterion are as follows:

We note that the 𝐵/𝑉𝑖𝑐𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑎 incidence proxy is not selected by the AIC for either model,
whereas the other four incidence proxies are all present in each model.

Results
Figure 1 plots the monthly incidence proxies for influenza A/H1N1, A/H3N2 (both
matching and drifted) and B (both Victoria and Yamagata) in Russia between 07/2013 and
07/2019. Figure 2 plots the daily rates of respiratory deaths and circulatory deaths by
month between 07/2013 and 07/2019. We note that there is a good temporal
correspondence between the “bumps” in mortality rates and peaks of influenza circulation.

drift variants of both influenza A/H3N2 and influenza B/Yamagata circulated in Russia
[18]. We note that this season was also associated with high rates of mortality in certain
other countries, e.g. [7]. We also note that the levels of influenza vaccination in Russia rose
significantly starting the 2016/17 season. Compared to the 2013/14 through the 2015/16
seasons (first 3 seasons), during the 2016/17 through the 2018/19 seasons, the volume of
influenza-associated mortality declined by about 16.1%, or 3809 annual deaths. Finally, we
note that the estimated ratio of circulatory to respiratory influenza-associated deaths in
Russia (about 4.22-to-1, Table 1) is quite higher that the corresponding estimate (about
1.35-to-1, [3]) for the US. At the same time, the overall ratio of circulatory-to-respiratory
deaths in Russia (about 14-to-1 in 2018, [20]) is much higher than the corresponding ratio
in the US (about 3.08-to-1 in 2017, [25]).

Discussion
Influenza circulation is known to be associated with a substantial mortality burden in the
Northern Hemisphere, e.g. [3-9]. At the same time, there is limited information on the
volume of influenza-related mortality in Russia, with estimates based on deaths with
influenza in the diagnosis [2,12-15] representing only a small fraction of all influenzaassociated deaths and not allowing for the evaluation of the relative contribution of
different influenza subtypes to the full volume of influenza-associated mortality
(Introduction). In this paper, we applied the previously developed methodology that was
used to evaluate the rates of influenza-associated mortality in several countries, e.g. [3,4,69] to estimate the rates of influenza-associated mortality for circulatory causes and
respiratory causes in Russia during the 2013/14 through the 2018/19 influenza seasons.
We estimate an average annual 17636 (95% CI (9482,25790)) circulatory death and 4179
(3250,5109) respiratory deaths during our study period, with influenza A/H3N2 being the
largest contributor to each cause of death, and influenza A/H1N1 and B (mostly

B/Yamagata, which is consistent with some evidence from other countries [26,21,22]) also
making a sizeable contribution to the volume of influenza-associated mortality. Moreover,
the significant increase in the influenza vaccination levels in Russia starting the 2016/17
season was associated with some reduction (16.1% on average) in the annual volume of
influenza-associated mortality. The prominence of circulatory deaths among influenzaassociated mortality may be related to the overall high rates of circulatory mortality in
Russia [20]. We hope that this work may help inform mitigation efforts. In particular, our
findings support further increases in vaccination coverage, particularly for individuals with
circulatory disease, with the contribution of influenza B/Yamagata to mortality
(particularly during seasons for which there was a mismatch between the circulating
influenza B viruses and the virus recommended for the trivalent vaccine [18]) also
supporting the use of quadrivalent vaccines. We also note in that regard that the 2018/19
influenza season saw minimal circulation of influenza B in Russia [17], raising the
possibility of a major influenza B epidemic during the 2019/20 season; as influenza
B/Yamagata strains are not present in the trivalent vaccine recommended for the 2019/20
season [27], this further supports the need for a quadrivalent influenza vaccine,
particularly for individuals with cardiac disease. Additionally, administration of antiviral
medications for certain population subgroups defined by age and presence of underlying
health conditions (particularly circulatory diseases) may help mitigate the burden of
severe outcomes during influenza epidemics in Russia.
Our paper has some limitations. We only had access to monthly mortality data; moreover,
those data are operational, with some delays in reporting, and some unreported deaths
during a given calendar year being reported for January of the next year [23]. Finer
mortality data stratified by week/age group are needed to get a more comprehensive
understanding of the contribution of influenza to mortality for different causes of death in
Russia. Additionally, due to the relatively small number of data points in the regression
framework adopted in this paper, we used a simple trigonometric model for the baseline
rates of mortality not associated with influenza circulation. Previous work (e.g. Supporting
Information for [3]) suggests limited sensitivity of the estimates of the rates of influenzaassociated mortality on the model for the baseline rates of non-influenza mortality.

We believe that despite those limitations, this work provides a national study of influenzarelated mortality in Russia, giving evidence for the substantial burden of influenzaassociated mortality, particularly for circulatory causes, delineating the contribution of
different influenza (sub)types to mortality and suggesting likely effects of the recent
increases in vaccination coverage on the volume of influenza-associated mortality. In
particular, our work supports further increases in vaccination coverage levels, particularly
for individuals with circulatory disease, as well as the use of quadrivalent influenza
vaccines and of antiviral medications for certain population groups. We hope that this work
would stimulate further efforts involving more granular data (in particular, weekly
mortality data, as well as data stratified by age) to better understand the effect of influenza
epidemics in Russia on mortality and help inform mitigation efforts for different population
subgroups.
