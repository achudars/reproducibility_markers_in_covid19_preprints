Abstract

100

Background: Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) and Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection

101

(SCAD) are related, non-atherosclerotic arterial diseases mainly affecting middle-aged

102

women. Little is known about their physiopathological mechanisms.

103

Objectives: We aimed to identify rare genetic causes to elucidate molecular mechanisms

104

implicated in FMD and SCAD.

105

Methods: We analyzed 29 exomes that included familial and sporadic FMD. Follow-up was

106

conducted by targeted or Sanger sequencing (1,071 FMD and 365 SCAD patients) or lookups

107

in exome (264 FMD) or genome sequences (488 SCAD), all independent and unrelated. We

108

used TRAPD burden test to test for enrichment in patients compared to gnomAD controls.

109

The biological effects of variants on receptor signaling and protein expression were

110

characterized using transient overexpression in human cells.

111

Results: We identified one rare loss-of-function variant (LoF) (MAFgnomAD=0.000075) shared

112

by two FMD sisters in the prostaglandin I2 receptor (hIP) gene (PTGIR), a key player in

113

vascular remodeling. Follow-up in >1,300 FMD patients revealed four additional LoF allele

114

carriers and a putative enrichment in FMD (PTRAPD=8×10-4), in addition to several rare

115

missense variants. We confirmed the LoFs (Q163X and P17RfsX6) and one missense (L67P)

116

to severely impair hIP function in vitro. Genetic analyses of PTGIR in SCAD revealed one

117

patient who carries Q163X, one with L67P and one carrying a rare splicing mutation

118

(c.768+1C>G), but not a significant enrichment (PTRAPD=0.12) in SCAD.

119

Conclusions: Our study shows that rare genetic mutations in PTGIR are enriched among

120

FMD patients and found in SCAD patients, suggesting a role for prostacyclin signaling in

121

non-atherosclerotic stenosis and dissection.

127

Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) and Spontaneous Coronary Artery Dissection

128

(SCAD) are non-atherosclerotic arterial diseases predominantly affecting women. Their

129

mechanisms and genetic causes are poorly understood. We identified rare loss-of-function

130

mutations of the prostacyclin receptor gene (PTGIR) in several FMD and SCAD patients,

131

including two affected sisters, and several unrelated patients. We also showed that a rare

132

missense mutation of PTGIR severely impairs prostacyclin receptor function in vitro. Our

data provide evidence for a role for prostacyclin signaling in the etiology of FMD and SCAD

Introduction

146

Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD) is an atypical and challenging vascular disease. FMD causes

147

non-atheromatous stenosis, dissection, tortuosity and aneurysms in medium-sized arteries,

148

mainly renal and carotid, but virtually all arteries can be affected (1). Although frequently

149

asymptomatic, FMD is often associated with debilitating conditions such as hypertension and

150

stroke and presents primarily in middle-aged women (80-90%), without hyperlipidemia or

151

obesity (2).

152

The pathology and molecular mechanisms of FMD are poorly elucidated, with data coming

153

mainly from observational studies using imaging and histology. Two main types of FMD

154

lesions are defined using angiographic classification (1). The most common is multifocal

155

FMD, which results in a “string-of-beads” appearance of the affected artery and represents

156

more than 80% of cases. Focal FMD accounts for the rest of cases and is characterized by

157

isolated stenosis. From the histology, the most commonly described lesions are medial

158

fibroplasia, corresponding to the multifocal angiographic appearance, with an observed excess

159

in fibrous connective tissue in the media of diseased arteries (1). An overall disorganization of

160

the medial layer is also observed, with clear cellular loss of smooth muscle cells (SMCs)

161

(3,4). The high proportion of early-middle age women among patients suggests a role for

162

female hormones and hormone-associated vascular remodeling in the disease, although clear

163

and direct mechanisms are still missing (5). Excessive pulsatility of arteries that results in the

164

accumulation of micro-traumas was also proposed as a potential cause (6). Another suggested

165

hypothesis is the occlusion of vasa vasorum that would result in intramural ischemia and

166

myofibroblast transformation of SMCs (7).

167

Observational studies report a substantial clinical association between FMD and Spontaneous

168

Coronary Artery Dissection (SCAD), an increasingly recognized cause of acute myocardial

169

infarction in young to middle-aged women (8,9), with 25 to 86% of SCAD patients presenting

170

FMD lesions in an additional arterial bed outside of the coronary circulation (8). FMD and

171

SCAD share several clinical features; in particular, they both primarily affect middle-aged

172

women and have a notable lack of classical atherosclerotic risk factors. SCAD is

173

characterized by the obstruction of a coronary artery due to the presence of an intramural

174

hematoma and/or a dissected intimal layer. As in the case of FMD, the pathological origin of

175

SCAD lesions is unclear (8). An important additional aspect of the overlap between these

176

diseases is that non-coronary arterial dissection (i.e. of the carotid arteries) is a common

177

feature in FMD.

178

The absence of prospective epidemiological studies and animal models restricts our

179

understanding of the natural history of or FMD and SCAD. A recent systems biology study

180

suggested an association between CD2AP encoding CD2-associated protein and its plasma

181

protein levels with FMD (10). The investigation of the genetic causes offers alternative angles

182

to understand the molecular pathology and mechanisms behind arterial lesions. In a recent

183

study, we identified the first genetic risk locus for FMD, a common variant located in the

184

phosphatase and actin regulator 1 gene (PHACTR1) (11). We also found that the same risk

185

allele for FMD was also at increased risk of SCAD, independently from the presence of FMD

186

lesions among SCAD patients (12). This genetic link between FMD and SCAD supported a

187

complex genetic pattern of inheritance for both diseases. Thus, a combination of genetic and

188

environmental factors (local micro-trauma, hormonal fluctuation) could trigger diverse

189

biological mechanisms that result in arterial remodeling and/or coronary artery dissection.

190

In a complex genetic model, rare pathogenic mutations may also represent causal factors with

191

incomplete penetrance in some patients (13), as is the case for several cardiovascular diseases

192

(e.g hypercholesteremia, coronary artery disease). To test this hypothesis, we applied exome

193

sequencing to 29 individuals including FMD siblings and sporadic early onset cases to search

for mutated genes with potential relevance to non-atherosclerotic arterial stenosis.

We

195

followed up one candidate gene in 1,335 FMD and 852 SCAD patients from four countries.

196

We provide evidence for the prostacyclin receptor to harbor recurrent rare mutations in FMD

197

and SCAD which result in loss of function of receptor signaling in vitro.

Clinical origin of patients and diagnosis criteria

203

FMD patients

204

Familial FMD cases were ascertained as patients with at least one first-degree relative with

205

confirmed FMD and were followed at the RVDRC. Sporadic FMD cases were recruited from

206

the Rare Vascular Diseases Reference Center (RVDRC) of the European Hospital Georges

207

Pompidou in Paris, France (HEGP), French ARCADIA (Assessment of Renal and Cervical

208

Artery DysplasIA) registry, Polish ARCADIA-POL registry, US DEFINE-FMD study,

209

University of Michigan Genetic Study of Arterial Dysplasia, Cleveland Clinic FMD

210

Biorepository, as described previously (10-12,14). In all studies, an FMD diagnosis was

211

established by clinical experts based on the observation of typical FMD-related lesions of

212

middle-size arteries on imaging (computed tomographic angiography, magnetic resonance

213

angiography, catheter-based angiography or duplex ultrasound in specialized centers) in

214

absence of features of other causes of arterial stenosis such as atherosclerosis or vasculitis,

215

biochemical evidence of inflammation, or syndromic arteriopathy. FMD experts reviewed

216

imaging to independently confirm the diagnosis. Except for the exome-sequencing analysis,

217

only unrelated cases were analyzed, as confirmed by the examination of medical records and

218

array-based genotyping data, when available.

219

SCAD patients

220

SCAD patients were recruited from the French DISCO French register study, the UK SCAD

221

Study, and the Victor Chang Cardiovascular Center (Australia). The diagnosis of SCAD was

222

confirmed by review of the index coronary angiogram by an experienced interventional

223

cardiologist with expertise in the recognition of SCAD, along with contemporaneous medical

224

records. Individuals without a diagnostic angiogram were excluded from all genetic analyses.

225

The majority of patients were of European origin. We obtained individual written informed

226

consent from all participants included. Clinical characteristics of patients are presented in

227

Table 1.

228

Immunohistochemistry

229

For immunohistochemistry, paraffin blocks of arterial tissues (3 renal arteries) were obtained

230

from surgical pathology archives of the European Hospital Georges Pompidou and belonged

231

to patients who agreed to donate remaining tissue for research purposes. We used two normal

232

renal arteries and one FMD artery where incident diagnosis was made from the histology.

Exome sequencing patients

236

We studied 21 FMD familial cases formed by 4 FMD sib-pairs, 2 sib-trios, 1 cousins-pair and

237

1 family with 5 affected sibs (Supplementary Figure S1 and (15)). We also studied 4 sporadic

238

FMD cases and had access to DNAs from unaffected parents of two of these cases, who were

239

analyzed as family trios and had an early onset FMD (12 and 16 years old at diagnosis). In

240

total, we analyzed 29 exome sequences. Exome and targeted re-sequencing were performed

241

by Integragen® Genomics (Evry, France), as previously described (15).

242

We also interrogated whole exome sequences for mutations in PTGIR from 264 FMD patients

243

(University Michigan), and whole genome sequences of 391 British (Leicester University)

244

and 96 Australian (Victor Chang Cardiovascular Center) SCAD patients. Sanger sequencing

245

was used to validate genotypes presenting low coverage (<10 reads) in the exome sequencing

246

data.

247

Direct re-sequencing patients

248

Direct sequencing of PTGIR was performed in a total of 1,071 FMD patients. Seven hundred

249

ninety were French patients from ARCADIA or the RVDRC, including the 374 analyzed by

250

target resequencing, 150 were US patients from the DEFINE-FMD study and 131 were Polish

251

from the ARCADIA-POL registry. We also screened 365 SCAD patients from the DISCO

252

registry (12). Sanger sequencing was performed on a 3730xl DNA Analyzer system (Applied

253

Biosystems).

254

Molecular characterization of mutants

255

Wild-type or mutant hIP protein were overexpressed in human embryonic kidney cells

256

(HEK293) for 48h. Cyclic adenosine mono-phosphate (cAMP) quantification was performed

257

using cAMP-Glo assay (Promega, WI, USA), according to manufacturer’s description.

258

Western Blot and immunofluorescence assays were performed as previously described (11).

259

Mouse anti-hIP (sc-365268, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, TX, USA) was used to detect

260

prostacyclin receptor.

262

Statistical analyses

263

Associations between PTGIR (LoF variants), FMD and SCAD were tested using a gene-based

264

burden test implemented in TRAPD (Testing Rare vAriants using Public Data) package. We

265

took advantage of the availability of latest version of gnomAD (v3) to evaluate the

266

enrichment of rare PTGIR alleles in patients (16). GnomAD v3 uses only whole genome

267

sequencing from >70000 individuals, which provides a homogeneous and large dataset with

268

high read depth (>99.9% of samples with >15X coverage at PTG1R locus) allowing robust

269

variant calling and estimation of the frequencies of these rare alleles. We used two-sided

270

Fisher’s exact test to estimate the enrichment p-values, as recommended by the authors (16).

271

Unless otherwise noted, p-values were evaluated from a Student’s t-test in functional

272

characterization experiments.

Results

276

Gene prioritization from exome sequencing data

277

We re-analyzed our previous exome sequences that included four affected sib pairs, two

278

affected sib trios, and one cousin pair (15) in combination with a new sample of one sib

279

quintet, two sporadic cases analyzed with both parents (two trios) and two unrelated sporadic

280

cases (Figure 1, Figure S1). Relevant variants were defined as non-synonymous predicted

281

deleterious or LoF unobserved or with low frequency in gnomAD (MAF<0.001). The inter-

282

family analysis and trio filtrations were inconclusive with no gene containing relevant

283

variants shared in at least two families, or recessive transmitted from parents to cases or de

284

novo in the trios.

285

We then restricted the analyses to genes with LoF variants following the potential

286

transmission pattern of each family, including dominant, recessive and compound

287

heterozygotes. A short-list of 27 genes was identified to which we applied three prioritization

288

tools (17-19). Using DAVID and STRING algorithms for functional annotations, we found

289

that 10 genes had potential roles in blood vessel biology and signaling. We then provided a

290

training list of genes involved directly or as regulators / effectors in stenosis and aneurysm

291

related phenotypes in human diseases and mouse knockout models to the ENDEAVOUR tool.

292

Using basic machine learning techniques to model the arterial dysfunctions observed in FMD,

293

ENDEAVOUR ranked the prostaglandin receptor gene (PTGIR) as the best candidate. PTGIR

contained one rare LoF (rs199560500 / Q163X, MAF = 0.00075 in gnomAD) that was shared

295

by two affected sisters from Family 2. PTGIR encodes prostaglandin I2 (prostacyclin)

296

receptor (hIP), a G protein-coupled receptor well known for its cardioprotective, anti-

297

atherosclerotic and anti-thrombotic functions (20). For follow-up, we selected a short list of

298

candidate genes based on prioritization tools, literature link with arterial stenosis, smooth

299

muscle contraction or extracellular matrix organization, in addition to PTGIR (Table S1).

300
301

Direct sequencing identifies recurrent LoF variants in PTGIR among FMD patients

302

We analyzed 20 genes using targeted amplicon sequencing in 374 patients (Table 1). A full

303

list of identified LoF variants is shown in Table S1. We found truncating variants in five

304

genes (P2RX6, P2RY4, P2RY11 P2RX4, and PTGIR). The variants identified in P2RX6,

305

P2RY4, P2RY11 and P2RX4 were either as common in FMD patients as in gnomAD or direct

306

sequencing did not confirm their presence. However, we found an additional patient carrying

307

Q163X, the same LoF variant identified by exome sequencing in one FMD sib pair, which

308

supported further the investigation of PTGIR coding sequences in more patients.

309

Overall, we analyzed 1,071 unrelated FMD patients by direct sequencing (Figure S2). First,

310

we confirmed Q163X carriers among the 374 patients and screened both PTGIR coding exons

311

in this sample, especially exon 2, which is incompletely covered by targeted amplicon

312

sequencing. Then, we sanger sequenced 632 additional FMD patients from France (N=416),

313

Poland (N=131) and US (N=150). We identified Q163X in one additional FMD patient and

314

one rare frameshift variant in two FMD patients (rs754755149 / P17RfsX6, MAF=9×10-5 in

315

gnomAD) (Table 2). We also looked up exome sequencing results in 264 FMD patients from

316

the University of Michigan/Cleveland Clinic biorepository and found one additional carrier of

317

Q163X at the heterozygote state. As the region coverage by exome sequencing at this locus

318

was low in this cohort (3X depth), we confirmed the presence of the variant using Sanger

319

sequencing (Figure S2).

320

Using TRAPD burden test, we found that the FMD cohort of patients (N=1,335) was

321

significantly enriched for LoF alleles in PTGIR compared to a control population from

322

gnomAD v3 (N=71,702, P=4×10-4, TRAPD burden test, Table S2). All LoF carriers are of

323

European ancestry. Similar enrichment was observed when we restricted the comparison to

324

Non-Finnish European controls (N=32,399, P=8×10-4, Table S2).

325
326

Functional characterization of rare LoF and missense variants in PTGIR

327

In addition to the two bonafide LoFs, we identified four rare missense variants in FMD

328

patients (MAFgnomAD<0.001, Table 2) for which functional characterization is not reported.

329

rs201261904 affects the N-terminal cytoplasmic extension of hIP (A2T), whereas the three

330

other variants are located in the transmembrane helices (L67P, M107V, R137C, Figure S3a).

331

Among these, rs1397542892 (L67P) affects a strictly conserved residue among vertebrate

332

orthologs of PTGIR and is predicted to be deleterious (SIFT score of 0, Polyphen score of 1,

333

Table 2, Figure S3b).

334

As mentioned, PTGIR encodes for the prostacyclin receptor. Therefore, to assess the potential

335

impact of PTGIR rare variants on cellular functions, we overexpressed wild type and mutant

336

hIP in the human embryonic kidney cell line HEK293 and measured production of cAMP in

337

response to Iloprost, a synthetic analogue of prostacyclin. We measured a 50% maximal

338

effective concentration of Iloprost (EC50Ilo) of 0.05nM for wild-type hIP (Figure 2). As

339

expected, transfection with plasmids encoding any of the two nonsense mutants Q163X and

340

P17RfsX6 resulted in a total loss of cell sensitivity to Iloprost (Figure 2a). All four missense

341

mutant proteins were at least partially functional in overexpressing cells (Figure 2b).

342

However, L67P hIP had a 100-fold decrease in Iloprost sensitivity (EC50Ilo = 14.1nM, p=1.1

343

× 10-4, Figure 2c) whereas other mutants were not significantly different from wild-type hIP.

344

Western Blot using anti-hIP antibody could detect all tested missense mutants, and the band

345

pattern was similar between wild-type and mutant proteins (Figure 3a, Figure S4a), showing

346

that no gross changes of post-translational modifications were caused by the mutations. L67P

347

mutant expression was strongly affected, sometimes undetectable (Figure 3a), with an average

348

signal reduction by 70 to 90% (N=4, p=0.03), whereas other mutants did not cause a

349

significant reduction of hIP expression. Using immunofluorescence in HEK293 cells, we

350

observed that wild-type hIP was mostly visible in the cytoplasm and at the plasma membrane

351

(Figure 3b, Figure S4b). Conversely, we observed a clear colocalization of L67P hIP protein

352

with intracellular organelles bound by Wheat Germ Agglutinin (WGA), a widely used lectin

353

that binds to sialic acid and N-acetylglucosaminyl modified proteins, thus suggesting L67P

354

mutation partly impairs hIP maturation (Figure 3b, Figure S5b). Finally, co-expression of

355

wild-type hIP (fused with mCherry) with wild type or mutant versions of hIP did not affect

356

cellular response to Iloprost (Figure S5a), which excludes the existence of a full dominant

357

negative effect of hIP mutants. However, co-expressing hIP-mCherry protein with mutant

358

hIP, we found that mature forms of hIP-mCherry were almost undetectable in presence of

359

Q163X and L67P hIP, whereas the other mutants had no effect on hIP (Figure S5b). This

360

suggests a potential dominant effect of these two mutants, providing a potential mechanism

361

for the pathogenesis of heterozygous PTGIR mutations.

362
363

Clinical features of FMD patients carrying PTGIR non-functional alleles

364

The patients harboring PTGIR non-functional alleles were all women, with ages at FMD

365

diagnosis ranging from 26 to 61 years (Table 3). Six of the seven patients had multifocal

366

FMD, and one patient had only a focal lesion. Lesions were first identified in the renal artery

367

for four patients and in the carotid artery for the other three patients. Five patients were

368

screened for multivessel FMD, and two of them had FMD lesions in other vascular beds. Five

369

patients had hypertension, with onset 1 to 10 years prior to FMD diagnosis, all of them having

370

renal FMD. No dissection or aneurysm was detected in any of the seven patients. Patient 5,

371

carrying the rs754755149 frameshift variant, was a 26-year-old woman with focal FMD

372

affecting one renal artery. She underwent angioplasty, which was initially successful, but

373

restenosis was seen during follow-up. All other patients had multifocal lesions. Patient 7,

374

carrying L67P missense, underwent angioplasty of both renal arteries, restoring normal blood

375

flow with a moderate benefit on the management of hypertension. Upon follow-up for >5

376

years, no restenosis was detected. The other patients had no angioplasty.

380

Histological localization of the prostacyclin receptor

381

Immunochemistry staining of three renal arteries from pathology archives (two normal, one

382

FMD) with human prostacyclin receptor (hIP) antibody showed protein presence in all arterial

383

layers, with a stronger expression in SMCs of the medial layer, both in normal and FMD

384

tissues (Figure S6). Of note, none of the patients carrying PTGIR mutations had vascular

385

surgery, which limited access to their arteries to evaluate the mutant proteins expressions.

386
387

Rare LoF mutations also identified in SCAD patients

388

Given the established clinical and genetic overlap between FMD and SCAD, we also screened

389

365 French SCAD patients from the DISCO registry for rare variants in PTGIR by direct

390

sequencing. We found one patient with a splicing variant not reported in gnomAD

391

(rs1302581755). The variant is a G to C substitution in position +1 of the 3’ end of exon 2,

392

disrupting the donor splicing site, resulting in a predicted LoF (Table S3). We also found one

393

more patient with L67P mutation. A look up for variants in genome sequences of 391 British

394

and 96 Australian SCAD patients identified one additional patient carrying the Q163X,

395

rs199560500 variant allele (Table S3). We also identified additional rare missense variations

396

of PTGIR in SCAD patients, for which functional effects are not known (Table S3). Although

397

PTGIR LoF alleles were relatively more frequent in SCAD patients than in gnomAD control

398

populations, we did not find a significant enrichment for LoFs in PTGIR among SCAD

399

patients compared to gnomAD controls using TRAPD burden test (P = 0.12).

402

Clinical features of SCAD patients carrying PTGIR LoF alleles

403

The SCAD patients were all women, aged 38 to 66 years at first SCAD event (Table 4).

404

SCAD patient 1, bearing rs199560500 variant, presented with non-ST elevation myocardial

405

infarction, hypertension on treatment with a history of gestational hypertension. Upon

406

coronary angiography, a very extensive dissection of the left mainstem coronary could be

407

identified, with no signs of atherosclerosis. The two other patients were older at the time of

408

their SCAD event (58 and 66 years), and SCAD lesions presented as a diffuse stenosis leading

409

to a partial or complete occlusion of the coronary artery, with a visible hematoma in the

410

arterial wall. Upon full screening of other arterial beds, these three SCAD patients did not

411

exhibit detectable FMD lesions.

414

Discussion

415

Here we describe rare loss-of-function and missense mutations in the prostacyclin receptor

416

gene (PTGIR) in FMD and SCAD patients (Central Illustration). We found that these

417

mutations severely impair prostacyclin receptor signaling in vitro and are prevalent at a rate

418

significantly higher in a cohort of ~1,300 FMD patients, compared to large unselected

419

publicly available cohorts. We also describe some of these rare mutations in SCAD patients,

420

without an overt significant enrichment. Our study describes an unprecedented genetic

421

impairment in the prostacyclin signaling in non-atheromatous arterial stenosis and dissection.

422

Further support for a shared genetic basis between FMD and SCAD

423

Understanding the accurate genetic model has been a challenging endeavor for FMD and

424

SCAD. We have recently established their complex genetic mode of inheritance through the
18

425

association between the common variant rs9349379 in PHACTR1 and an increased risk for

426

both diseases (11,12). After a first negative exome sequencing study in FMD (15), we

427

increased the sample numbers and applied a prioritization strategy that allows the

428

identification of PTGIR as a novel gene mutated in FMD. A recent exome study conducted on

429

SCAD families described rare mutations in TLN1 (21). The identification of PTGIR as an

430

additional gene involved in FMD and potentially SCAD further supports their complex

431

genetic basis involving both common and rare mutations. We suspect incomplete penetrance

432

for the mutations described in PTGIR. Several LoF variants are reported in gnomAD, which

433

include population-based and diseased cohorts, but in lower frequency compared to FMD

434

patients. On the other hand, the high estimated prevalence of asymptomatic FMD in

435

unselected populations (1-6%) (1) is compatible with a substantial number of undiagnosed

436

FMD patients carrying PTGIR mutations among these large public cohorts. Here we estimate

437

in our cohorts that at least 0.5% of FMD patients carry a non-functional PTGIR allele. Of

438

note, this rate of PTGIR mutation carriers is comparable to the percentage reported for PSCK9

439

mutation carriers (0.6%) among cohorts of hypercholesterolemia (22).

440

Rare non-functional LoFs in PTGIR among FMD and SCAD patients

441

We provide evidence for complete loss of protein function in vitro caused by the two LoFs

442

and showed that missense mutations are functional, especially the L67P that strongly impairs

443

the receptor signaling and protein function. Previous studies have implicated PTGIR missense

444

variants, in particular rs4987262 (R212C), in atherosclerosis and thrombosis (23). It should be

445

noted that this variant is relatively frequent (1% in Non-Finnish European populations in

446

gnomAD) and was identified in 22 FMD patients and 12 SCAD patients in our cohorts,

447

including one SCAD patient with homozygous mutation (Table S3). Apart from L67P

448

mutation, all missense mutations studied here show a 2 to 5-fold decrease in sensitivity to

449

Iloprost, similar to previous observations for R212C mutation (24). We note that several rare

450

missense variants identified in SCAD patients only were not functionally characterized. It is

451

therefore possible that we underestimate the pathogenicity of PTGIR missense mutations.

452

The prostacyclin signaling and physiopathology of arterial stenosis and dissection

453

The loss or decrease in prostacyclin signaling has a wide range of biological consequences, all

454

compatible with arterial remodeling and dissection observed in FMD and SCAD patients.

455

Prostacyclin is a well-established vasodilator, with anti-thrombotic and anti-atherosclerotic

456

properties. Prostacyclin is also a potent repressor of the proliferation and migration of SMCs

457

from the vascular wall and promotes their contractile phenotype (20), which is compatible

458

with the lesions observed in FMD. A high level of fibrotic tissue characterizes FMD lesions.

459

Interestingly, prostacyclin signaling is known to repress fibrosis in several tissues (20). The

460

cAMP signaling downstream hIP is a well-known regulator of fibroblast function and a

461

repressor of fibrosis through the direct inhibition of ECM synthesis, myofibroblast

462

differentiation and fibroblast proliferation (25). Prostacyclin effects are often seen as opposite

463

to the effects of Thromboxane A2, a closely related prostaglandin, which favors thrombosis

464

and vasoconstriction, and their balance is a key to several pathologies (20). Aspirin, widely

465

prescribed for its anti-thrombotic properties, inhibits the production of both prostacyclin and

466

thromboxane and may compensate the effect of unbalanced prostacyclin/thromboxane

467

signaling in FMD patients. However, anti-thrombotic medication may represent an additional

468

risk in patients developing aneurysms in middle-size arteries, and the screening for PTGIR

469

mutations may help identify patients that could benefit of such medication. On the other hand,

470

Iloprost is used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, scleroderma, Raynaud's phenomenon

471

and other diseases with prominent vasoconstriction, and may have unpredictable effects in

472

patients bearing hIP mutations (20). Whether FMD and SCAD patients with PTGIR mutations

473

may exhibit increased platelet aggregation and an increased risk of developing pulmonary

474

arterial hypertension or thrombosis would be an interesting investigation to conduct in the

475

future. Given the high relevance of the prostacyclin to thromboxane balance to vascular

476

function, the genetic investigation of more genes linked to these pathways could provide

477

additional clues about the role of this mechanism in FMD and SCAD.

478

Study limitations

479

The prevalence of the identified PTGIR LoFs is low and affects a small fraction of FMD and

480

SCAD patients. On the other hand, the study samples are relatively limited, compared to other

481

complex cardiovascular diseases and may result in inaccurate estimation in mutation rate

482

among patients. We lack large pedigrees with clinical and genetic information in affected and

483

unaffected members to assess the extent of the penetrance of PTGIR mutations. We do not

484

provide significant support for enrichment in SCAD, compared to FMD, potentially due to

485

differences in samples sizes. We identified heterozygous LoFs, with biological consequences

486

that are hard to predict considering the multiple biological functions of hIP, and its possible

487

interactions/compensations with related prostaglandin receptors in a more complex

488

physiological system.

489

490

Conclusions

491

We identified genetic defaults in PTGIR that impair its cellular function and are likely to be

492

rare genetic causes for FMD and SCAD. According to our genetic screen of FMD and SCAD

493

cohorts, we estimate PTGIR mutations to be present in ~0.5% of FMD patients and ~0.3% of

494

SCAD patients. Larger studies are needed to refine these estimations, which should include a

495

greater number of patients. This finding, and the availability of multiple drugs targeting this

496

pathway, may help clinicians to design specific therapeutic approaches for FMD and SCAD

497

patients. Further genetic analyses involving functionally related genes are required to fully

498

evaluate the influence of this pathway on the pathogenesis of non-inflammatory stenosis and

499

dissection observed in FMD and SCAD arteries.

500

501

Clinical perspectives

502

This study adds evidence to the possibility of FMD and SCAD share a common genetic basis.

503

We show that rare loss of function variants in the gene encoding the prostacyclin receptor

504

(PTGIR) are enriched in FMD patients and present in SCAD patients. This pathway is a target

505

of widely used drugs such as aspirin or iloprost. If this mechanism is confirmed by further

506

larger genetic and clinical studies, these findings may help the clinicians identify the best

507

therapeutic strategy to treat FMD and SCAD patients in the future.

Methods
Familial cases
FMD cases were recruited from the French database of the Rare Vascular Diseases Referral
Centre of the European Hospital Georges Pompidou (HEGP), Paris, France. An expert panel
using clinical information from the medical history, the examination and the interview of the
patient, the interpretation of angiography and/or computed tomography scan defined the FMD
diagnosis after the exclusion of other causes of arterial stenosis (mainly atherosclerosis,
Takaysu disease and Elhers Danlos syndrome). Familial FMD cases were ascertained as
patients with at least one first-degree relative with confirmed FMD. We identified eight
pedigrees from which we selected at least two patients per pedigree with DNA quality and
quantity compatible with exome sequencing experiments. Selected patients are sibs in all
families, except in Family 7 wherein they are first cousins (Figure S1). Intrafamily controls
could not be identified, as angiography explorations in healthy members of these families
were not available. We also selected 2 early onset cases (<20 years at diagnosis) for whom
both unaffected parents could be contacted and were willing to participate in the study, and 2
severe sporadic cases for whom parents could not be contacted. The study was approved by
local institutional ethics committee (Approval CCPPRB Paris-Cochin #RBM 00-028) and all
individuals gave written informed consent.
ARCADIA-RVDRC
We analyzed unrelated FMD followed-up at the Rare Vascular Diseases Reference Center
(RVDRC) of the European Hospital Georges Pompidou (HEGP), Paris, France. We
ascertained patients from the ARCADIA (Assessment of Renal and Cervical Artery
DysplasIA) register, an ongoing national FMD registry at the HEGP, Paris. The diagnosis of
FMD in RVDRC and ARCADIA patients was established using clinical information from the
medical history, the interpretation of angiography and/or computed tomography scan of

1

arterial beds after the exclusion of other causes of arterial stenosis such as atherosclerosis,
Takayasu disease and Elhers Danlos syndrome and neurofibromatosis type 1. Given the
complexity of the interpretation of imaging of vascular diseases, a local panel of experts
including clinicians from the departments of hypertension, radiology, vascular medicine and
medical genetics validated the diagnosis of FMD. French FMD study protocol was approved
by the Ile-De- France research ethics committee (Comité de Protection des Personnes: CPP
d’île de France) on 03/04/2009 (ID: 2009-A00288-49). In the context of ARCADIA registry,
women and men aged ≥18 years, diagnosed with RA or eCVA FMD, were prospectively
recruited at 16 university hospitals in France and Belgium. Most participating centers were
approved by the European Society of Hypertension as Hypertension Excellence Centers or by
the French Ministry of Health as FMD Competence Centers. Specialists in hypertension,
vascular medicine, vascular neurology, and vascular radiology were available in all centers.
The protocol was approved by the Comité de Protection des Personnes Ile-de France II. All
participants provided written informed consent. The procedures followed were in accordance
with the institutional guidelines.
ARCADIA-POL
All patients were women and men aged over 18 years entering a Polish multicenter registry
involving 32 centers in Poland with coordination of Department of Hypertension Institute of
Cardiology. Each of these centers followed referral pattern and identified patients with newly
diagnosed or established or suspected renal FMD, FMD in any vascular bed, or spontaneous
artery dissection (particularly in carotid, vertebral, or coronary arteries). Only FMD patients
were screened in this study.
All patients underwent detailed clinical evaluation including ambulatory BP measurements
(ABPM), biochemical evaluation, biobanking, duplex Doppler of carotid and abdominal
arteries. In all patients, a computed tomography angiography of intracranial and cervical
arteries as well as a computed tomography angiography of abdominal aorta and its branches
including coeliac trunk, mesenteric arteries, common hepatic artery, splenic artery, renal
arteries and iliac arteries were performed during one hospital stay. FMD was diagnosed as
nonatherosclerotic arterial encroachment or stenosis affecting the trunk or branches of
medium size arteries, in the absence of aortic wall thickening, biochemical evidence of
inflammation and known syndrome arterial disease. Renal FMD was divided into multifocal
and unifocal types are preciously defined. Unifocal FMD corresponded to a single stenosis on

2

a given vessel, regardless of its length, and multifocal FMD to at least two stenoses on a given
vessel segment. Patients with FMD lesions affecting at least two of the four predefined
vascular beds (renal artery, extracranial carotid and vertebral arteries, intracranial arteries,
mesenteric/splenic arteries and iliac arteries) were classified as having multisite FMD, and the
others (irrespective of the presence of unilateral or bilateral FMD lesions of the paired
arteries) were classified as single-site FMD. The diagnosis of FMD and its types was made by
two independent investigators. The ARCADIA-Pol protocol was approved by local
authorities (authorization number : IK-NP-0021-101/1482/16).

The DEFINE-FMD Study
DEFINE-FMD is a systems biology study aiming to DEFINE key disease drivers and
mediators of FMD. Its forerunner pilot study, the CAUSE study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT01808729), enrolled its first ‘run-in’ control subject on 31 October 2012, and first FMD
patient on 22 February 2013. As the CAUSE study approached target enrolment it was closed
(at n = 34 subjects) and we initiated DEFINE-FMD (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier:
NCT01967511). Both the CAUSE and DEFINE-FMD studies were approved by the
institutional review board of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and all subjects
gave written informed consent. The investigation conformed to the principles outlined in the
Declaration of Helsinki.
All FMD cases were seen and assessed in the Mount Sinai Vascular Medicine Clinic.
Inclusion criteria for entry into DEFINE-FMD include ≥18 years of age, being freely willing
to participate, and fluency in English. FMD cases are required to have a clinical diagnosis of
multifocal FMD that is confirmed by imaging [computed tomographic angiography (CTA),
magnetic resonance angiography, or catheter-based angiography]. While DEFINE-FMD was
recently expanded and is now also enrolling subjects with spontaneous coronary artery
dissection (SCAD) or cervical artery dissection (CvAD) in the absence of typical multifocal
FMD, these subjects with isolated SCAD or CvAD were not included in this analysis.
However, for this analysis confirmed multifocal FMD cases were permitted to have SCAD
and/or CvAD. Exclusion criteria (for cases and controls) include: co-morbidities which reduce
life expectancy to 1 year; any solid organ or hematological transplantation, or those in whom

3

transplantation is considered; active autoimmune disease; illicit drug use; HIV positive; prior
malignancy.

University of Michigan Genetic Study of Arterial Dysplasia and Cleveland Clinic FMD
biorepository
Patients were recruited at the University of Michigan (UM) and/or the Cleveland Clinic. UM
FMD cases were recruited into an IRB approved study through a referral clinic at the
University of Michigan and through self-referral to the study (University of Michigan IRB
number HUM00044507 and Cleveland Clinic FMD biorepository IRB number 10–318). The
Cleveland Clinic cases were enrolled among consecutive patients seen at a dedicated FMD
referral clinic. A vascular medicine specialist ascertained clinical diagnosis of FMD after
review of diagnostic imaging and prior to blood sample collection. DNAs from healthy
controls without vascular disease were obtained from the Cleveland Clinic Gene Bank, which
was approved by the Cleveland Clinic IRB. Genomic DNA was isolated from a peripheral
blood sample and analyzed as described (3).
The DISCO Study
French patients were recruited through the DISCO protocol, a nation-wide study aiming to
assess the presence of FMD and its genetic determinants in a SCAD cohort using the clinical
criteria defined in (1,2). Patients were included prospectively and retrospectively following
inclusion criteria of age > 18 years, provided consent for genetic studies, and a confirmed
diagnosis of SCAD by clinical presentation, angiography analyses confirmed by optical
coherence tomography or intravascular ultrasound. (Clinical Trials ID: NCT02799186,
approved by regional committee CPP Sud-Est 6 2016 AU-1258). DNAs from patients were
genotyped by direct sequencing and were mostly Europeans.

The UK SCAD study
The UK SCAD study is ethically approved by the NHS Health Research Authority
(14/EM/0056) subjects were recruited from the UK mainland. All participants were
Europeans defined as such using genome-wide genotypes and/or clinical records.

4

Australia SCAD study
Patients from Australia were identified largely through a social media platform. The study
was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of St. Vincent’s Hospital, Sydney.
Genotyping was performed by Sanger sequencing (Garvan Molecular Genetics, Australia,
NATA ISO17025 and ISO15189 certified). Controls were healthy subjects all >70 years old,
available through the Medical Genome Reference Bank (MGRB) that involves genomic data
performed by the Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics, Australia. All participants were
Europeans defined using genome-wide genotypes and/or clinical records.

Sequencing
Exome-sequencing and gene filtration strategy
Exome and targeted re-sequencing were performed by Integragen® Genomics (Evry, France),
as previously described (15). Briefly, 3µg genomic DNA was sonicated to 150-200bp, and
paired-end Illumina were ligated on repaired, A-tailed fragments. Purified, and PCRamplified material was hybridized to Sureselect oligo probe library for 24h and affinitycaptured. Eluted fragments were further amplified and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000
instrument (paired-end 75bp run). Sequences were mapped to hg19 genome using ELANDv2
algorithm and variant calling were performed using Illumina pipeline (CASAVA1.8).
Analysis of variations identified by exome sequencing was made using PolyWeb, an in house
software (Paris Descartes Platform) that allows filtering-out of irrelevant variants (common,
synonymous, low coverage, and predicted by Polyphen2 or SIFT as benign). This tool allows
the comparison of results of patients and their relatives and takes in account the dominant,
recessive and de novo modes of inheritance. Family structures of individuals were indicated
when available, the three isolated cases were considered as independent families. In silico
characterization and prioritization of genes with LoFs shared by members of the same family
was performed using DAVID, a web-based tool for functional annotation and clustering of list
of genes, STRING, to find functional protein association networks and ENDEAVOUR, a
method that allows prioritization of genes using basic machine learning techniques to model
the biological process under study and then to score and rank the candidate genes using that
model (4-6).

Targeted amplicon/Next-Generation Sequencing
Targeted enrichment was performed with a PCR method on the Access Array microfluidic
support from Fluidigm. 320 primer pairs were designed with Primer3, for an average product
size of 261pb. Library preparation followed the description of the Access Array User Guide
with Integragen optimizations (AmplIG) with increased level of multiplexing. Forty eight
pools of 332 PCR obtained from one Access Array were subjected to a second round of PCR
for 10 cycles in a standard microplate format in order to add specific barcodes for sample
identification and P5/P7 Illumina adapters for Illumina sequencing. The 48 pools were then
controlled and quantified on Fragment Analyzer to perform 1 equimolar pool of 64 samples.
Finally one run of one lane of MiSeq V2, 2x150b was launched for 64 samples.
Base calling was performed using the Real-Time Analysis software sequence pipeline (2.7.6)
with default parameters. Sequence reads were mapped to the human genome build ( hg19 /
GRCh37 ) for 2X analysis and a fasta file with amplicons sequences for 1X analysis using

insertions/deletions (max. size is 300nt), taking into account all reads per position. SNVs and
indels with Q(SNPs) < 10 and Q(Indel) < 20, or regions with low mappability (QVCutoff <
90) were filtered out. Variants annotation was based on dbSNP (dbSNP144), the 1000
Genomes Project (phase1_release_v3.20101123), the Exome Variant Server (ESP6500SI-V2SSA137), and the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC r3.0) and an in-house databases.
Functional consequences of variants on genes were predicted by Variant Effect Predictor
(VEP release 83), using SIFT (sift5.2.2) and PolyPhen (2.2.2) scores in the case of missense
mutations.
Sanger sequencing
PTGIR fragments (four amplicons) were amplified using primers containing identical
Illumina tails (0.5µM each) with JpStart Taq ReadyMix (Sigma Aldrich) with the following
program: initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 minutes, then 35 cycles of 20s at 95°C, 20s at
60°C, 20s at 72°C, and a final 7 minutes extension step at 72°C. Twenty ng genomic DNA
were used per reaction. 10µL of the reaction were cleaned of remaining dNTPs and primers
by incubating with 0.4 unit FastAP Thermosensitive Alkaline Phosphatase (Thermo Fisher
Scientific) and phosphatase and 2 units Exonuclease I (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 30
6

minutes at 37°C, and enzymes were deactivated at 86°C for 10 minutes. 2µL of the reaction
mix (from 16 µL) was used for sequencing reaction using BigDye™ Terminator v3.1 Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Illumina tail
F primer was used for all sequencing reactions. Sequencing was performed on a 3730xl DNA
Analyzer system (Applied Biosystems).
For Sanger sequencing performed on University of Michigan samples, sequencing was
performed as follow. Primers were designed around rs199560500 location. 10ng of genomic
DNA of case and control was amplified using Phusion HF taq (NEB, Ipswich MA) and the
following

primers:

(Takara Bio, Moutain View, CA) and sent for Sanger sequencing (University of Michigan,
Advanced Genomics Core).
Whole exome sequencing of FMD cases from the University of Michigan cohort
From each research participant, either blood or saliva samples were obtained using standard
K+ EDTA tubes or commercial collection kits (Oragene, DNAGenotek). DNA was isolated
according to the protocol of commercial kits (Nucleospin Tissue (TakaraBio), prepIT-L2P
(DNAGenotek) and quantified using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA kit (ThermoFisher).
Samples were randomized onto 96-well barcoded plates for exome sequencing at the
Northwest Genomics Center (NWGC, University of Washington, Seattle WA) and shipped to
the NWGC sequencing center. Quality control and sample tracking throughout the WES
pipeline was conducted via sex-typing and sample fingerprinting, conducted through high
frequency genotyping of cosmopolitan single nucleotide variants informative for individual
identity. Samples with adequate DNA concentration and integrity, accurate sex-typing, and
high quality fingerprint assay were sequenced.
Library Production, Exome Capture, Sequencing: Library construction and exome capture
were performed using an automated (Perkin-Elmer Janus II) 96-well plate format. 1 ug of
genomic DNA was subjected to a series of shotgun library construction steps, including
fragmentation through acoustic sonication (Covaris), end-polishing, A-tailing and ligation of
sequencing adaptors with dual 8 bp barcodes for multiplexing, followed by PCR
amplification. Libraries underwent exome capture using SeqCap EZ Exome v2.0 Target
Enrichment Probes (~36.5 MB target) (Roche/Nimblegen, Pleasanton, CA). Prior to

7

sequencing, the library concentration was determined by fluorometric assay and molecular
weight distributions verified on the Agilent Bioanalyzer (consistently 150 ± 15 bp).
Sequencing: Barcoded exome libraries were pooled using liquid handling robotics prior to
clustering (Illumina cBot) and loading. Massively parallel sequencing-by-synthesis with
fluorescently labeled, reversibly terminating nucleotides was carried out on the HiSeq
sequencer, with 8 exomes multiplexed per lane.
Read Processing: NWGC’s sequencing pipeline is a combined suite of Illumina software and
other industry standard software packages (i.e., Genome Analysis ToolKit [GATK], Picard,
BWA-MEM, SAMTools, and in-house custom scripts). The pipeline includes base calling,
alignment, local realignment, duplicate removal, quality recalibration, data merging, variant
detection, genotyping and annotation. Variants in the PTGIR gene were extracted for review.
Variant analysis
Frequencies were retrieved from gnomAD v3 considering the Non-Finnish European (NFE)
and general population (all) as potential references. Combined Annotation Dependent
Depletion (CADD) score aggregates many different indicators including conservation scores,
ENCODE data and protein level scores to predict potential deleterious effect of SNVs by
evaluating the likelihood of these annotations. In the scaled metric shown here, a CADD score
>30 means that the variant belongs to the 0.1% of variants for which annotations are the less
likely to appear by chance, indicating possible deleterious effect of the variation. Sorting
Intolerant from Tolerant (SIFT) and Polymorphism Phenotyping (PolyPhen) scores predict
whether a given amino acid substitution may affect protein function based on sequence
homology and physical properties of amino acids. A SIFT score close to 0 or a PolyPhen
score close to 1 indicate a possible deleterious alteration. CADD, SIFT and PolyPhen scores
were recovered from ENSEMBL variant webpage (www.ensembl.org).
Statistical analyses
To test association between PTGIR gene (LoF variants) FMD we applied a gene-based
burden test, which compares the overall burden of rare protein-modifying variants in a given
gene in case and control subjects, using large-scale public sequencing databases such as
Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) as control subjects. This approach is implemented
in TRAPD package (7). Assuming a dominant model for PTGIR gene, we tabulate the number

8

of individuals who carry at least one qualifying variant in our case cohort (n=1335) For the
gnomAD control dataset (n= 71702 for all samples, n= 32299 for Non-Finnish Europeans
only), the number of control subjects carrying at least one qualifying variant in PTGIR was
approximated by the sum of all the qualifying variants allele counts in that gene. Finally, a
two by two contingency table was constructed from tabulation of case and control counts.
Table S2 represents the distribution of FMD/SCAD cases and control subjects according to
the presence of qualifying variant in PTGIR. We used a two-sided Fisher’s exact test to
estimate the association p-values.
Cell culture and transfection
HEK293 cells were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) containing
4.5g/L Glucose, GlutamaxTM and sodium pyruvate (Gibco), supplemented with 10% Fetal
Bovine Serum (Corning) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco). For transfection, cells were
seeded at 40% confluence and transfected using Fugene HD (Promega), according to
manufacturer’s instructions. To prepare precipitates, Fugene and DNA were mixed in a 2.5
µLFugene/µgDNA ratio in culture medium and incubated for 5 minutes, before adding to the
cells.

Plasmids preparation
A full list of primers and plasmids used in this study can be found in Tables S4 and S5. All
PCR steps were performed using Phusion Flash High-Fidelity PCR Master Mix (Fisher
Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions. The complete
sequence of human PTGIR was amplified from human genomic DNA with primers containing
restriction enzyme sites and subcloned between NheI and HindIII sites of pcDNA-FLAG-HA
plasmid (addgene #52535, (8)). To generate PTGIR expression plasmids, coding regions from
exon2 and exon3 were amplified separately with an overlapping primer. The two products
were mixed with DNA Polymerase, and missing ends were elongated. Primers containing
restriction enzyme sites were then added to amplify the complete coding sequence of PTGIR,
and the digested product was integrated between XhoI/BamHI sites of pcDNA-FLAG-HA. To
generate point mutants, two fragments on each side of the mutation were amplified, using a
common primer containing the mutated sequence. The two products were mixed with DNA
Polymerase, missing ends were elongated, and the complete product, containing the mutation,
9

was then amplified using external primers containing restriction enzyme sites and integrated
into pcDNA-FLAG-HA as before. To generate a PTGIR-mCherry expression plasmid, the
sequence of mCherry was amplified and inserted between NotI and BamHI sites of pcDNAFLAG-HA. Then PTGIR sequence (without stop codon) was amplified and inserted between
NheI and NotI sites, removing FLAG-HA tag at the same time. mCherry control expression
plasmid was created by inserting mCherry between NheI and XhoI sites of pcDNA-FLAGHA, also removing FLAG-HA tag.
Cyclic Adenosine mono-Phosphate (cAMP) quantification
HEK293 cells were seeded at 40% confluence in two wells of 6-wells plates, and
transfected on the next day with PTGIR expression plasmids. 48h after transfection, cells
were trypsinized and counted. Cells were seeded in white opaque 96-wells plates (Corning,
NY, USA) at a density of 20000 cells/well. After 24h, cells were washed once with PBS and
treated with 20µL induction buffer (Dulbecco’s PBS (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA)
containing 500µM isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (Sigma Aldrich, MS, USA) and 100µM 4-(3butoxy-4-methoxybenzyl) imidazolidone (Sigma Aldrich, MS, USA), alone or containing 1013

to 10-6 M Iloprost (Sigma Aldrich, MS, USA). After 25 minutes incubation, cell lysis and

measure of cAMP concentration were performed using cAMP-Glo assay (Promega, WI,
USA), according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Western Blot
HEK293 cells were seeded at 40% confluence in 12-wells plates, and transfected on the next
day with PTGIR expression plasmids and/or mCherry expression plasmids. 48h after
transfection, cells were washed once with PBS and 100µL 2X Laemmli Sample buffer
(Biorad, CA, USA) was added to each well. Cells were scrapped and collected into 1.5mL
tubes, then incubated at 95°C for 10 minutes, with 900rpm agitation. Lysates were then
centrifuged for 5 minutes at 12000g, and supernatants were frozen at -20°C.
Frozen samples were then thawed, supplemented with 5µL β-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma
Aldrich, MS, USA) and incubated at 95°C for 5 minutes. 15µL of lysates were loaded and
separated onto Mini-PROTEAN 12% TGX precast gels (Biorad, CA, USA). Proteins were
transfered to a Protran Nitrocellulose membrane (Whatman, Maidstone, UK). Membranes
were incubated 1h in Tris-buffered Saline supplemented with 0.05% Tween (Sigma Aldrich,
MS, USA) (TBST) and 5% non-fat milk. Membranes were then incubated with the following
10

primary antibodies in TBST supplemented with 2% non-fat milk : mouse anti-hIP 1/500 (sc365268, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, TX, USA), mouse anti-β-Actin 1/1000 (sc-47778, Santa
Cruz Biotechnologies, TX, USA), rabbit anti-mCherry 1/1000 (ab167453, Abcam,
Cambridge, UK), mouse anti-FLAG M2 1/1000 (F1804, Sigma Aldrich, MS, USA). After
three 10min washes, membranes were then incubated with 1/20000 HRP-anti-mouse-IgG or
HRP-anti-rabbit-IgG for 1h. After three 10min washes, revelation was performed using
SuperSignal West Pico or Femto Fast Western Blot Kit (Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH,
USA), and images taken using a LAS4000mini system (GE Healthcare, IL, USA). Image
processing and quantification were performed using Fiji ImageJ software (fiji.sc).
Immunofluorescence staining
HEK293 cells were seeded at 30% confluence on 10mm glass coverslips in 24 wells plates,
and transfected on the next day with PTGIR expression plasmids. 48h after transfection, cells
were washed once with DPBS and fixed for 15 minutes with 4% Formaldehyde (Fisher
Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA) in DPBS. Cells were then washed three times with DPBS and
incubated 10 minutes with 5µg/mL Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated Wheat Germ Agglutinin
(W11261, Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA). Cells were washed again 3 times in DPBS
and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 in DPBS for 15 minutes. Cells were then blocked
with DPBS+5% non-fat milk for 1h, then incubated for 2h with primary antibody (mouse
anti-PTGIR (sc-365268, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, TX, USA)) diluted to 1/100 in the same
buffer. After 3 DPBS washed, cells were incubated for 1h with secondary antibody (Goat
anti-Mouse-IgG Alexa 647 (A28181 Fisher Scientific, Hampton, NH, USA)) at a 1/500 in
DPBS/5% milk. Cells were washed 3 times in DPBS, then incubated with 1µg/mL DAPI for
15 minutes, washed again 3 times in DPBS, and twice in ddH2O. Coverslips were mounted
on microscope slides using Aqueous Mounting Medium (CTS011, R&D Biosystems, MN,
USA), and imaged using a Zeiss Axioimager Z2 Apotome system (Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany), with a 100x objective. Raw images were processed using Fiji ImageJ software
(fiji.sc).
Immunohistochemistry staining
Protein staining were performed on paraffin embedded artery samples using anti-hIP (1/100,
sc-365268, Santa Cruz Biotechnologies, TX, USA), anti-MYH11 (1/100, sc-6956, Santa Cruz
Biotechnologies, TX, USA) and anti-α-Actin (1/100, α-Actin smooth muscle antibody (1/100,

11

α-ASM, Clone1A4, Dako, Trappes, France) primary mouse antibodies and revealed using an
ABC peroxidase kit with diaminobenzidine (Vector laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA). The
arterial tissues were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin. Antigen retrieval were
performed by incubating tissue sections in alkaline solution (Dako, Trappes, France) for 40
minutes at 94°C in a hot water bath.

Figure S1: Families trees of FMD families.
* indicates the subjects for which exome-sequencing was performed. Black color indicates a
confirmed FMD diagnosis. Hatching indicates subjects diagnosed with hypertension.
Figure S2: Chromatograms showing the nonsense and uncharacterized missense
variants identified in FMD patients
Figure S3: Position and conservation of newly characterized IP mutants
a) Representation of IP protein secondary structure, with its 7 transmembrane domains and Nand C-terminal domains. Colored residues indicate possible deleterious mutations due to rare
or common variants, based on SIFT/PolyPhen scores (red/purple = deleterious, green =
tolerated). Black arrows indicate the four previously uncharacterized mutants identified in this
study. b) Alignment of human IP with orthologs in vertebrates. Prostacyclin receptor
sequences were recovered from Uniprot, keeping only full-length IP proteins in vertebrates.

Figure S4: Evaluation of mutant IP protein expression and localization
a) SDS-PAGE/Western Blot assay on whole cells extracts of HEK293 cells overexpressing
wild-type or mutant IP (with FLAG-HA N-terminal tag) and mCherry. mCherry was used as a
transfection control to evaluate the success and homogeneity of transfection in each sample.
hIP, mCherry and β-Actin were detected using specific primary antibodies. hIP is detected as
a mix of bands and higher molecular weight smear due to its extensive post-translational
modification. This independent experiment (compared to Figure 3) shows the expression of
L67 hIP mutant with a similar appearance compared to WT hIP, although at a lower level. b)
Immunofluorescence visualization of HEK293 cells overexpressing wild-type or L67P hIP.
hIP localization was assayed using hIP specific antibody and Alexa647-conjugated secondary
antibody (purple signal). Fixed cells were incubated with Alexa488-conjugated Wheat Germ
Agglutinin (WGA, green signal), recognizing phosphoproteins, and with DAPI to stain DNA
(blue signal). Images were taken with 100x objective on a Zeiss ApoTome system. White
arrows show the position of intracellular aggregates stained by WGA, corresponding to the
18

endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus, where hIP staining is clearly visible on L67P mutant,
but not on WT protein.
Figure S5: Evaluation of mutant IP effect on co-expressed wild-type IP
a) Concentration of cAMP in HEK293 cells overexpressing wild-type hIP-mCherry and wildtype or mutant FLAG-HA-hIP or pcDNA-FLAG-HA (pcDNA). HEK293 cells were treated
with various doses of Iloprost for 25 minutes, before cAMP concentration was measured
using cAMP-Glo assay. Error bars represent the standard deviation of three biological
replicates. b) SDS-PAGE/Western Blot assay on whole cells extracts of HEK293 cells
overexpressing wild-type or mutant hIP (with FLAG-HA N-terminal tag) and wild-type IPmCherry. mCherry antibody was used to detect crude IP-mCherry, FLAG antibody to detect
FLAG-HA-IP, and hIP antibody to detect both hIP and its more modified forms (including Nterminally cleaved, isoprenylated and palmitoylated forms).
Figure S6: Immunohistochemical visualization of IP and smooth muscle cells markers in
normal arteries or in an FMD lesion.
Specific antibodies targeting human prostacyclin receptor (hIP), smooth muscle Actin (αSMA) and smooth muscle Myosin heavy chain (smMHC) were used to detect these proteins
in 2 normal renal arteries (a) and one renal artery with FMD lesion close to an aneurysm (b).
Positive labeling is indicated by orange/brown color.
