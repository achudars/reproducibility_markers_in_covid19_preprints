Long-term oxytocin effects in ASD – Bernaerts et al.
1

ABSTRACT

2

Background

3

Intranasal administration of the ‘prosocial’ neuropeptide oxytocin is increasingly explored as a

4

potential treatment for targeting the core characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

5

However, long-term follow-up studies, evaluating the possibility of long-lasting retention effects

6

are currently lacking.

7

Methods

8

Using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial

9

explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of four weeks of intranasal oxytocin

10

treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do

11

so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and

12

characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after four weeks

13

of treatment (approximately 24 hours after the last nasal spray administration), and at two

14

follow-up sessions, four weeks and one year post-treatment.

15

Results

16

No treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social

17

symptoms (Social responsiveness scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect

18

to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in

19

the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (p= .37). Also informant-

20

rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin,

21

compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: p= .19).

22

Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in

23

the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in

24

self-reported repetitive behaviours (p= .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance towards others

25

(p= .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to one month and even one

26

year post-treatment. Treatment-specific effects were also revealed in screenings of mood

states (Profile of Mood States), indicating higher reports of ‘vigor’ (feeling energetic, active,

2

lively) in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (p= .03).

Conclusions

4

While no treatment-specific improvements were evident in terms of core social symptoms, the

5

current observations of long-term beneficial effects on repetitive behaviors and feelings of

6

avoidance are promising and suggestive of a therapeutic potential of oxytocin treatment for

7

ASD. However, given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, future studies are warranted to

8

evaluate the long-term effects of OT administration further.

Long-term oxytocin effects in ASD – Bernaerts et al.
1

1. Background

2

Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is characterized by lifelong impairments in social and

3

communicative functioning, and the presence of stereotyped behaviors and interests (1). In

4

the past decade, intranasal administration of the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) has increasingly

5

been explored as a potential pharmacological treatment for targeting the core characteristics

6

of ASD. Endogenous OT is synthesized in the hypothalamus where neurons of the

7

paraventricular nuclei project to various areas of the central nervous system involved in

8

complex (social) behaviors (e.g. amygdala). In typically developing individuals, OT has been

9

linked to interpersonal bonding, parental care, and the ability to establish trust and form social

10

attachments (2,3).

11

With respect to ASD, initial clinical trials have demonstrated that a single dose of OT can

12

induce behavioral enhancements on tasks assessing repetitive behavior (4), affective speech

13

comprehension (emotional intonations) (5), facial emotion recognition (6) and social decision

14

making (cyberball computer game) (7). Multiple-dose trials assessing the effects of OT

15

treatment in adults with ASD have also shown beneficial effects. Anagnostou et al. (8)

16

assessed the safety and efficacy of six weeks of intranasal OT treatment on core autism

17

symptom domains (social cognition/function and repetitive behaviors) in 19 adults with ASD

18

(16 men, 3 women), and showed improved emotion recognition, quality of life and tentative

19

improvements in repetitive behaviors after OT treatment. In another study with 20 adult men

20

with ASD, Watanabe et al. (9) studied the effects of six weeks of intranasal OT administration

21

on core autism characteristics and showed significant improvements in social reciprocity and

22

social functioning (social-judgement task). In a more recent large-scale trial, Yamasue et al.

23

(10) also assessed the effects of six weeks of intranasal OT treatment on core autism symptom

24

domains in 106 adult men with ASD and showed significant improvements in repetitive

25

behaviors.

26

However, a more mixed pattern of results emerged from studies assessing the effects of

27

multiple-dose OT treatment in children with ASD. For example, Dadds et al. (11) assessed

Long-term oxytocin effects in ASD – Bernaerts et al.
1

behavioral effects of a four-day intranasal OT treatment in 38 boys with ASD (7 to 16 years

2

old) during parent-child interaction training, but found no OT-specific improvements in

3

repetitive behaviors or social responsiveness. Later, also Guastella et al. (12) failed to show

4

beneficial effects after an eight-week OT treatment on core ASD characteristics in slightly older

5

boys (12 to 18 years old). On the other hand, a more recent trial assessing the effects of five

6

weeks of intranasal OT treatment on core ASD characteristics in 31 children with ASD (27

7

boys, 4 girls) was able to demonstrate improved social responsiveness as reported by the

8

parents (13). Similarly, Parker et al. (14) investigated whether a four-week intranasal OT

9

treatment could improve core autism characteristics in 32 children (6-12 years old) with ASD

10

and showed an increase in parent-reported social responsiveness. Taken together, findings of

11

these initial multiple-dose trials provided indications for a more consistent (positive) pattern of

12

results for OT trials with adults with ASD (8–10), compared to trials with children with ASD (11–

13

14).

14

To date, however, potential long-term effects of OT treatment that outlast the period of actual

15

administration have not yet been addressed in adults with ASD. These assessments, however,

16

would be of high relevance since repeated administrations over an extended period might

17

induce long-lasting, experience-dependent adaptations within neural circuits. With respect to

18

ASD, it has been postulated that early-life impairments in social attention/orienting may deprive

19

patients of adequate social learning experiences that normally drive the typical development

20

of social brain networks (15). Considering that OT is hypothesized to increase the saliency of

21

social cues (16) OT therapy might induce an enrichment of social experiences that stimulates

22

long-term adaptations in social behaviors.

23

In this pilot study, we assessed - for the first time - the possibility of long-term retention effects

24

of four weeks of intranasal OT administration on core autism symptom domains (including

25

social responsiveness and restricted and repetitive behaviors), attachment characteristics and

26

general aspects of quality of life in adult men with ASD. While prior multiple-dose trials mainly

27

explored the effects of treatment on these core autism symptom domains, a recent study from

Long-term oxytocin effects in ASD – Bernaerts et al.

our lab (17), showed that two weeks of OT treatment in typically developing young-adult men

2

reduced self-reported feelings of attachment avoidance and increased self-reported feelings

3

of secure attachment toward peers. Against this background and given the growing body of

4

research demonstrating an important role of the oxytocinergic system in interpersonal trust and

5

attachment (18–20), the current study also included an initial assessment of attachment

6

measures to evaluate the long-term effects of OT treatment in adults with ASD. With respect

7

to ASD, Rutgers et al. (21) suggested that most children with ASD (53%) are able to form a

8

secure attachment to caregivers, but that they are significantly less likely to do so compared

9

to typically developing children. In addition, a recent meta-analysis concluded that more severe

10

autism characteristics are associated with less secure attachment in children with ASD (22).

11

The effects of treatment on core autism characteristics and attachment were assessed

12

immediately after the four-week treatment period, and at follow-up sessions, four weeks and

13

one year post-treatment, to assess the possibility of retention effects that outlast the period of

14

actual administration. In line with prior multiple-dose studies (8,9,17), we hypothesized that

15

multiple doses of OT would improve self-report and informant-based ratings of social

16

responsiveness and repetitive behaviors, and ameliorate self-ratings of attachment

17

characteristics and quality of life. A key question was to evaluate whether any beneficial effects

18

of multiple-dose OT treatment would outlast the period of actual administration until one month

19

(four weeks) and/or one year post-treatment.

This two-arm, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled parallel study was performed at

24

the Leuven University Hospital (Leuven, Belgium) to assess multiple-dose effects of intranasal

treatment-induced effects would outlast the period of actual administration. To do so, changes-

2

from-baseline (T0) in self-report and informant-based questionnaire scores were assessed

3

immediately after four weeks of OT treatment (T1), and at two follow-up sessions, four weeks

4

(T2) and one year post-treatment (T3) (See Figure 1, CONSORT Flow diagram for number of

5

participants randomized and analysed). Written informed consent was obtained from all

6

participants prior to the study. Consent forms and study design were approved by the local

7

Ethics Committee for Biomedical Research at the University of Leuven, KU Leuven (S56327)

8

in accordance to The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki).

9

The trial was registered with the European Clinical Trial Registry (Eudract 2014-000586-45)

10

and the Belgian Federal Agency for Medicines and Health products. Note that the data

11

presented in the current report are part of a larger clinical trial in which neural measures (i.e.

12

task-based and resting-state magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)) were assessed in addition

13

to the presented questionnaire data. These MRI modalities are however not part of the current

14

report and will be reported elsewhere (manuscripts in preparation).

Participants

16

Forty high-functioning adult men with a formal diagnosis of ASD were recruited between April

17

2015 and December 2016 from the Autism Expertise Centre at the Leuven University Hospital.

18

The diagnosis was established by a multidisciplinary team (child psychiatrist and/or expert

19

neuropediatrician, psychologist, speech/language pathologist and/or physiotherapist) based

20

on the strict criteria of the DSM-IV-TR (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental

21

Disorders(1). Prior to the intervention, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS or

22

ADOS-2) (23,24) and estimates of intelligence (6-subtest short version of the Wechsler Adult

23

Intelligence Scale-IV Dutch version: Block design, Digit span, Similarities, Vocabulary, Symbol

24

search and Visual puzzles (25) were acquired from all participants (Table 1). Inclusion criteria

25

comprised a clinical diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder; gender (male); and age (18-35

26

years old). Exclusion criteria for participation comprised any neurological disorder (e.g., stroke,

27

epilepsy, concussion); demonstrated genetic disorder; or any contraindication for MRI (note

use and the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders were screened (Supplementary

3

Table S1). Forty participants were randomly allocated to either the OT (n=22) or the PL group

4

(n=18) (see Figure 1, CONSORT Flow diagram). The initial sample size (n=40) was set to be

5

comparable to three prior studies showing significant effects of multiple-dose OT treatment on

6

similar outcome measures (8,9,17).

Intervention

8

Participants were assigned to receive the OT or placebo (PL) treatment based on a computer-

9

generated randomized order. Except for the manager of randomization, all research staff

10

conducting the trial, participants and their parents and/or partners were blinded to treatment

11

allocation. OT (Syntocinon®, Sigma-tau) and PL (saline natrium-chloride solution) were

12

administered in amber 15 ml glass bottles with metered pump (ACA Pharma). Each puff per

13

nostril contained 4 international units (IU) of OT. Participants self-administered a daily dose of

14

24 IU (3 puffs/nostril) over four consecutive weeks (28 doses in total). This dose is in

15

accordance with prior OT administration studies in neurotypical (young) adults (26,27) and

16

adults and adolescents with ASD (6,28,29). At this dosage, no side effects or contraindications

17

of OT have been described (29). All participants received clear instructions about the use of

18

the nasal spray (17,30) and were monitored onsite until approximately two hours after first

19

nasal spray administration. During the course of the treatment, participants were asked to

20

administer the nasal spray in the morning, to keep a daily record of the time point of nasal

21

spray administration, and whether or not they were alone or in company of others the first two

22

hours after administration. Percentage of days at which the spray was administered in the

23

presence of others was not significantly different between treatment groups (OT: 36.8 % (SD

24

29.9); PL: 36.0 % (SD 25.1); t(37)= .09; p= .93). Participants administered the nasal spray (OT

25

or PL) daily during four consecutive weeks and at the end of each week participants were

26

screened for potential adverse events, side effects (Supplementary Table S2) or changes in

27

mood with the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire (Table 2 and Supplementary

Figure S1). Finally, at the end of the trial, participants were asked if they thought they had

2

received OT or PL. The majority of participants thought they had received the PL treatment

3

(79.5%). The proportion of participants that believed they had received the OT treatment was

4

not significantly larger in the actual OT group (28.57%), compared to the PL group (11.11%)

5

(p=.18). Nonetheless, secondary analyses were performed to explore whether treatment

6

effects were modulated by the participants’ own belief about the received treatment

7

(Supplementary Results).

Outcome Measures

9

The Social Responsiveness Scale (for adults) (SRS-A) total score was used as the primary

10

outcome measure (self-report and informant-based versions). The other behavioral

11

questionnaires were considered secondary: Repetitive Behavior Scale - Revised (RBS-R);

12

State Adult Attachment Measure (SAAM); Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment (IPPA);

13

Quality of Life questionnaire of the World Health Organization (WHO-QOL) (all self-report).

14

More detailed information on each of the adopted questionnaires is provided in

15

Supplementary Methods.

16

In short, the SRS-A (64 items) (31) comprises four subscales examining social communication,

17

social awareness, social motivation and rigidity/repetitiveness, using a four-point Likert-scale.

18

SRS-A raw total scores were adopted.

19

The RBS-R (43 items) (32) examines a heterogeneous set of repetitive behaviors including

20

stereotypic behavior, self-injurious behavior, compulsive behavior, ritualistic behavior,

21

sameness behavior and restricted interests behavior, using a four-point Likert-scale. RBS-R

22

raw total scores were adopted.

23

The SAAM (33) comprises three subscales examining attachment security (e.g., “I feel like I

24

have someone to rely on”) (7 items); attachment anxiety (e.g., “I feel a strong need to be

25

unconditionally loved right now”) (7 items); and attachment avoidance (e.g., “If someone tried

26

to get close to me, I would try to keep my distance”) (7 items) using a seven-point Likert-scale.

27

SAAM raw subscale scores were adopted.

The IPPA (34) examines trait attachment to (i) mother (12 items); (ii) father (12 items); (iii)

2

peers (12 items), using a four-point Likert-scale. The IPPA assesses attachment security along

3

three dimensions: degree of mutual trust, quality of communication and extent of anger and

4

alienation. IPPA raw subscale scores were adopted.

5

Finally, the abbreviated version of the WHO-QOL (35) assesses general quality of life related

6

to physical health, psychological health, social relationships, and environment using a five-

7

point Likert scale. WHO-QOL raw total scores were adopted.

8

All questionnaires were assessed at baseline (T0), immediately after four consecutive weeks

9

of nasal spray administration (approximately 24 hours after the last nasal spray administration)

10

(T1), and at follow-up sessions, four weeks (T2) and one year post-treatment (T3). Given that

11

this is an exploratory pilot study evaluating the possibility of long-term retention effects of OT

12

treatment, no primary time point was pre-specified.

13

2.5.

Data Analysis

15

For each questionnaire, baseline differences between groups were assessed using two-

16

sample t-tests. To assess between-group differences, pre-to-post difference scores were

17

calculated for each assessment session (T1, T2, T3) and difference scores were subjected to

18

a linear mixed-effects model (one-tailed) with the random factor ‘subject’, and the fixed factors

19

‘treatment’ (OT, PL), ‘session’ (T1, T2, T3) and ‘treatment x session’ interaction. An intention-

20

to-treat format and last-observations-carried-forward to replace missing data was adopted. For

21

participants with missing baseline data, analysis for that measure was excluded list-wise

22

(Figure 1 CONSORT Flow diagram). Cohen’s d effect sizes of between-group differences

23

(change from baselineOT–change from baselinePL)/pooled standard deviation) are reported in

24

Table 2, separately for each outcome measure and assessment session, where 0.2 is

25

indicative of a small effect, 0.5 a medium effect and 0.8 a large effect (36). Additionally, pre-

26

to-post difference scores were subjected to single-sample t-tests to assess within-group

27

changes (compared to baseline) in the OT group and PL group separately (Table 2). All

Primary outcome - Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS-A)

10

Self-rated SRS-A. Between-group analyses revealed no significant main effect of treatment

11

(F(1,76)= .12, p= .37, ŋ2= .00), nor a treatment x session interaction effect (F(2,76)= 1.17, p=

12

.16, ŋ2= .03), indicating that pre-to-post changes in self-reported social responsiveness were

13

not significantly larger in the OT compared to the PL group (see Figure 2 and Table 2 for the

14

effect sizes of between-group differences separately for each session). Within-group analyses

15

showed that SRS-A scores were significantly reduced (compared to baseline) in the OT group

16

at session T1 (immediately after treatment: p= .033), T2 (one month post-treatment; p= .048)

17

and at trend-level at session T3 (one year post-treatment: p= .07). However, a similar reduction

18

(compared to baseline) was evident in the PL group at session T2 (p= .015), indicating no

19

specific benefit of OT over the PL treatment (see Table 2 reporting single-sample t-tests

20

assessing within-group changes from baseline).

21

Informant-rated SRS-A. Between-group analyses of the informant-rated SRS-A scores

22

revealed no significant main effect of treatment (F(1, 60)= .78, p= .19, ŋ2= .03), nor a treatment

23

x session interaction effect (F(2, 60)= .83, p= .22, ŋ2= .03), indicating that pre-to-post changes

24

in informant-rated social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the OT compared to

25

the PL group (see Figure 2 and Table 2 for the effect sizes of between-group differences

26

separately for each session). Note however that at session T2 (one month post-treatment),

In terms of repetitive behaviors, between-group analyses identified a significant main effect of

treatment (F(1, 74)= 3.20, p= .04, ŋ2= .08) (but no treatment x session interaction: F(2, 74)=

9

in repetitive behaviors were significantly larger in the OT compared to the PL group (see Figure

10

2 and Table 2 for the effect sizes of between-group differences separately for each session).

11

Within-group analyses confirmed that RBS-R scores were significantly reduced (compared to

12

baseline) in the OT group at session T1 (immediately after treatment: p= .002), T2 (one month

13

post-treatment; p= .002) and session T3 (one year post-treatment: p= .02), but not consistently

pre-to-post improvements in attachment avoidance were significantly larger in the OT

compared to the PL group (see Figure 2 and Table 2 and for the effect sizes of between-group

Between-group analyses showed that pre-to-post changes in self-reported secure attachment

Screening of changes in mood and side effects

6

As listed in detail in Supplementary Table S2, only minimal, non-treatment specific side

7

effects were reported.

8

In terms of changes in mood as assessed with the Profile of Mood states (POMS), between-

9

group analyses identified a significant main effect of treatment for the mood state ‘vigor’

10

(F(1,76)= 4.09, p= .03, ŋ2= .10) (but no treatment x session interaction: F(2,76)= .04, p= .96,

11

ŋ2= .001), indicating that across assessment sessions, self-reports of ‘vigor’ (feeling

12

‘energetic’, ‘active’, ‘lively’) were significantly higher in the OT group compared to the PL group

13

(see Table 2 for the effect sizes of between-group differences separately for each session).

14

While no significant pre-to-post changes were evident within the OT group, the PL group

15

showed a significant reduction (compared to baseline) in self-reported vigor at session T1 (p=

16

.002) (see Table 2 reporting single-sample t-tests assessing within-group changes from

17

baseline).

18

No treatment-specific changes were identified for the other mood states (tension, anger,

19

depression, fatigue) (see Table 2 and Supplementary Figure S1), although note that

20

significant reductions (compared to baseline) in feelings of tension and fatigue were reported

21

both in the OT group and in the PL group (see Table 2 reporting single-sample t-tests

22

assessing within-group changes from baseline).

Associations between ASD characteristics and attachment characteristics

25

Taken together, treatment-specific effects of a four-week OT treatment were most pronounced

26

in terms of improvements in repetitive behaviors (RBS-R) and perceived attachment avoidance

(SAAM). Here, we specifically explored whether and how the quantitative autism

attachment characteristics (SAAM and IPPA). We additionally explored whether individuals

2

with ASD displayed more impairments in attachment, when their baseline behavioral

3

characterizations were compared to those previously obtained from a sample of neurotypical

4

individuals (n=40, mean age = 21.1, S.D. = 2.6) (data adopted from (17)).

5

Higher self-reported SRS-A scores (at baseline) (more impairment in social responsiveness)

6

were significantly associated with lower perceived secure attachment (IPPA) towards peers

7

(r= -.55, p< .001), mother (r= -.51, p= .001) and father (r= -.34, p= .034) and with higher

8

perceived attachment avoidance (SAAM) (r= .38, p= .018), but not with other reports of

9

attachment characteristics (security: r= -.26, p= .12; anxiety: r= .08, p= .63). Further, higher

10

scores on the RBS-R (more frequent and/or severe repetitive and restricted behaviors) were

11

significantly associated with lower perceived secure attachment (IPPA) towards the mother (r=

12

-.56, p< .001), but not the father (r= -.31; p= .056) or peers (r= -.22, p= .19). Finally, higher

13

scores on the RBS-R were also significantly associated with higher perceived attachment

14

avoidance (r= .50, p= .002), but not with other reports of attachment characteristics (security:

15

r= -.11, p= .50; anxiety: r= -.02, p= .89).

16

Notably, exploratory analyses also showed that as a group, the individuals with ASD reported

17

significantly higher perceived attachment avoidance (t(76)=-2.51, p=.014), lower attachment

18

security (t(76)=2.48, p=.015), and a trend towards lower perceived secure attachment towards

19

peers (IPPA) (t(76)=1.74, p=.085), when compared to a neurotypical sample of adult men (data

20

obtained from (17)) (Supplementary Table S4).

Long-term oxytocin effects in ASD – Bernaerts et al.
1

4. Discussion

2

The current trial demonstrated no treatment-specific effects in the primary outcome assessing

3

social symptoms (SRS-A, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reports

4

of social responsiveness, pre-to-post improvements were evident both in the OT (at session

5

T1 and T2) and in the PL group (at session T2), but with no specific benefit of OT over the PL

6

treatment (no significant between-group difference). Correspondingly, in three previous long-

7

term administration trials, improvements in social symptoms (SRS-A: 9, 12) (ADOS subscale

8

assessing social reciprocity: 10) were identified both in participants receiving the OT treatment

9

and in those receiving the placebo treatment, but with no significant difference between the

10

two groups. As suggested by Yatawara et al. (2016), one explanation for these unspecific

11

effects may be the presence of a placebo response which has been shown to occur frequently

12

in paediatric autism pharmacological and dietary placebo-controlled trials (40). In the context

13

of OT trials, increased public attention over the last decade may have influenced the

14

expectations of patients or parents especially with respect to the anticipated effects of OT

15

treatment on social functioning (hence the observed unspecific improvements in self-rated

16

SRS-A scores directly assessing the social domain).

17

Also with respect to the effect of multiple-dose OT treatment on informant-based reports of

18

social responsiveness (SRS-A), no overall treatment-specific improvements were observed

19

(despite the identification of a reduction in informant-rated symptom severity in the OT group,

20

but not in the PL group at session T2) (see Table 2 reporting within-group changes). In prior

21

studies with young children with ASD, significant treatment-specific improvements in caregiver-

22

rated social responsiveness have been identified immediately after 4 or 5 weeks of OT

23

treatment (13,14). The lack of a treatment-specific effect in our trial versus previous trials in

24

children might relate to the frequency of contact of children versus adult populations with their

25

respective informants (i.e., more frequent, sustained child-informant contact), potentially

26

rendering more subtle improvements in social functioning in the adult population to remain

27

undetected by informants.

Long-term oxytocin effects in ASD – Bernaerts et al.
1

While no significant treatment-specific effects were identified in social symptoms,

2

exploratory analyses identified long-lasting OT-specific improvements in a secondary outcome

3

assessing attachment characteristics (SAAM), indicating a reduction in feelings of avoidance

4

in the OT, compared to the PL group. While the exact neuromodulatory mechanisms of OT

5

treatment are unknown, OT has been implicated in enhancing the salience of socially-relevant

6

cues, inducing reductions in (social) stress and anxiety, and modulating approach/avoidance

7

motivational tendencies, presumably by impacting on limbic circuits (e.g. amygdala) and the

8

central reward system (e.g. nucleus accumbens). As such, by enhancing social salience and

9

reducing social stress/anxiety, the daily OT administrations over a course of four weeks, may

10

have induced increased feelings of approachability (reduced avoidance) during social

11

interactions. Furthermore, the observation that these beneficial effects of multiple-dose OT

12

treatment on perceived attachment avoidance outlasted the period of actual administration

13

until one month and one year post-treatment, provides support to the notion that repeated

14

administrations over an extended period of time might induce long-lasting adaptations in social

15

brain circuits, presumably in an experience-dependent manner. Indeed, through positive re-

16

enforcement, the recursive experience of the social environment as more ‘secure’ or

17

‘approachable’ (during the period of actual OT administrations) can be anticipated to have

18

contributed to the observed long-lasting adaptations in one’s motivational tendencies (i.e.

19

increased feelings of social approachability). Considering that attachment avoidance reflects

20

a reluctance to trust others and an emphasis on autonomy, whereas attachment anxiety

21

reflects insecurity about oneself (low trust in oneself) and fear of being rejected (33), our results

22

suggest that the four-week OT treatment predominantly improved a person’s reluctance

23

towards closeness or trust in others (i.e., attachment avoidance), but that it could not induce

24

significant long-term alterations in a person’s feelings of insecurity about one’s own abilities

25

(i.e., attachment anxiety). The notion that OT may thus predominantly influence one’s

26

reluctance to engage in closeness or intimacy with others (rather than one’s fear of being

27

rejected) may be interpreted within the framework of the recently proposed affiliative-

28

motivation hypothesis (37) suggesting that OT specifically acts by increasing affiliative strivings

Long-term oxytocin effects in ASD – Bernaerts et al.
1

and that individuals with a decreased tendency to affiliate (e.g. avoidantly attached individuals

2

rather than anxiously attached individuals) may be most likely to benefit from OT treatment.

3

Overall, the observation of a beneficial effect of OT on feelings of approachability is in line with

4

findings from a previous study from our lab (17), in which we demonstrated similar treatment-

5

specific reductions in perceived avoidant attachment (as well as improvements in perceived

6

secure attachment to peers) after a two-week course of OT treatment in neurotypical men. Our

7

findings also extend previous studies showing beneficial effects of a single dose of OT on

8

attachment security (20), development of trust and cooperation (18) and improved communal

9

traits and altered agency (19).

10

In addition to the treatment-specific effect on attachment avoidance, long-lasting

11

treatment-specific improvements were also identified in terms of repetitive behaviors (RBS-R),

12

indicating an overall reduction in repetitive behaviors in the OT group, compared to the PL

13

group. While the exact link between expressions of repetitive behaviors and difficulties in the

14

social domain is unclear, it has been suggested that at least in a subset of individuals with

15

ASD, the experience of the external (social) milieu as ‘unapproachable’ or even ‘threatening’

16

may result in an increased ‘need for sameness’ in order to sustain a level of control over the

17

external surroundings (38,39). The current study provides preliminary evidence that multiple-

18

dose OT treatment may relieve an individual from this increased ‘need for sameness’ and the

19

resulting need for engaging in repetitive and restricted behaviors. Overall, these observed

20

effects on repetitive behaviors are in line with previous trials with adult men with ASD showing

21

beneficial effects of OT on repetitive behaviors after 4 hours of intravenous OT administration

22

(4) and after 6 weeks of daily administrations (8,10). Note however that one six-week trial with

23

adult men with ASD did not show OT-specific improvements on informant-based reports of

24

repetitive behaviors (9). Also, in previous trials with children and adolescents with ASD, no

25

improvements on repetitive behaviors were observed after 4 days or 4, 5, or 8 weeks of daily

26

OT administration (11–14). In this view, it appears that beneficial effects of OT treatment on

27

repetitive behaviors were mostly demonstrated in studies that adopted assessments based on

28

self-reports (current study, (4,8)), whereas no beneficial effects were evident in studies

1

adopting informant-based reports of repetitive behavior (9–14, with the exception of 10).

2

Together, these findings may therefore indicate that self-reports, as opposed to informant-

3

based reports, may be more sensitive for capturing subtle, self-experienced changes in

4

repetitive behaviors.

5

While not included as an explicit outcome measure, screenings of changes in mood

6

states (Profile of Mood States questionnaire (POMS)) showed a treatment-specific effect for

7

the mood state ‘vigor’, indicating higher reports of feelings of vigor (e.g., feeling ‘energetic’,

8

‘active’, ‘lively’) in the OT group, compared to the PL group. To our knowledge, this is the first

9

study adopting screenings of mood states in an OT trial with ASD patients. In a previous study

10

from our lab (17), the POMS was also adopted to evaluate the effects of a two-week OT

11

treatment in neurotypical men, and while here, no treatment-specific changes in vigor were

12

detected, the POMS revealed OT-specific reductions in feelings of tension and anger. In the

13

current study, reductions in feelings of tension were also reported, but irrespective of received

14

treatment, indicating no specific benefit of OT over the PL treatment. While speculative, the

15

stabilizing effect of OT administration on reports of vigor might be related to the (highly

16

understudied, but in the ASD community heavily discussed) phenomenon of ‘autistic burnout’.

17

Individuals with ASD describe ‘autistic burnout’ as an extreme fatigue and inability to meet the

18

demands of everyday life caused by a continuous attempt to mask and/or deal with their ASD

19

symptoms (i.e. sensory disorders, repetitive behaviors (1)). The overall mitigation of repetitive

20

behavior symptoms and increased feelings of social approachability by the OT treatment may

21

therefore have been accompanied with overall higher reports of feeling ‘energetic’, ‘active’,

22

‘lively’ in the OT group, compared to the PL group. However, considering the exploratory nature

23

of the identified effects, more research is needed to further elucidate the impact of OT

24

treatment on mood states in ASD.

25

Finally, with respect to the effect of OT on general aspects of quality of life, the current

26

study identified no treatment-specific improvements. To date, evidence on the effects of OT

27

on quality of life is relatively scarce since only two prior studies have addressed this topic.

28

Contrary to our findings, Anagnostou et al. (8) reported an OT-specific improvement in quality

of life (socio-emotional section) after a 6-week treatment in adult men with ASD. Watanabe et

2

al. (9) on the other hand, only observed a trend towards improvement in quality of life

3

immediately after a 6-week trial in adult men with ASD. Importantly, recent reviews stated that

4

most individuals with ASD have poor quality of life (note that most studies included children

5

with ASD) (41) or lower quality of life than typically developing adults (42). Note, however, that

6

to date there is no comprehensive ASD-specific quality of life assessment tool validated and

7

consequently, the tools used in the general population (i.e. WHO-QOL) might not be the most

8

adequate to assess quality of life in ASD (and thus changes in quality of life after intervention)

9

(42).

10

In terms of associations between core autism characteristics and attachment

11

characteristics, our study showed that impairments in social responsiveness and more

12

frequent and/or severe repetitive behaviors were associated with a more avoidant attachment

13

style and with less secure attachment towards significant others (especially the mother). Albeit

14

exploratory, we also showed that, as a group, the individuals with ASD scored higher on

15

avoidant attachment and lower on secure attachment, when compared to a sample of

16

neurotypical individuals. Together, these findings provide indications that - at least to some

17

extent - associations are evident between core autism characteristics and attachment

18

characteristics, a notion that is generally supported by a recent meta-analysis showing an

19

association between the severity of autism characteristics and less secure attachment in

20

children with ASD (22), as well as by other studies showing more insecure attachment towards

21

parents or romantic partners in unmarried (43) or married adults with ASD (44), respectively.

22

However, since research on this topic to date is limited, it currently remains speculative

23

whether the reported feelings of insecure attachment are a result of the social difficulties

24

experienced by individuals with ASD, or conversely, whether difficulties in the social domain

25

are – in part or within a subset of individuals with ASD - a result of a decreased tendency or

26

inability to form secure attachments. Nevertheless, elucidating the interaction between autism

27

symptomology and attachment style may be of particular relevance in the context of OT

28

treatment, since – according to the aforementioned affiliative-motivation hypothesis –

Long-term oxytocin effects in ASD – Bernaerts et al.
1

especially individuals with a decreased tendency to affiliate (i.e., avoidantly attached

2

individuals) have been proposed to benefit the most from receiving OT treatment (37). The

3

current findings of significant ameliorations in attachment avoidance, but no treatment-specific

4

effects on social responsiveness, are in line with this notion and together suggest that

5

attachment characteristics may be more sensitive for evaluating treatment responses, as

6

compared to evaluations based on core autism characteristics alone. Considering the mixed

7

pattern of effects of OT treatment on core autism symptomatology (e.g. SRS-A, RBS-R,

8

ADOS), it seems of great relevance for future multiple-dose clinical trials with individuals with

9

ASD to additionally include more in-depth characterizations of attachment-related constructs

10

both dimensionally and longitudinally (pre-post treatment). In view of the current observations,

11

these explorations are anticipated to be informative for evaluating and predicting treatment

12

responses, and potentially for delineating patient populations that will benefit the most from a

13

course of OT treatment.

14

Limitations. Although the current study provides new insights regarding long-lasting effects of

15

multiple-dose OT treatment in ASD and the relation between autism characteristics and

16

attachment characteristics, several limitations need to be considered. First, although our

17

sample size was comparable to that of prior similar clinical trials, studies with larger samples

18

are warranted. Indeed, considering this is an initial pilot study exploring long-term effects of

19

OT treatment (without correction for multiple comparisons), the findings of long-term

20

improvements in repetitive behaviours; attachment avoidance and vigor mood state should be

21

interpreted with caution. Second, in the current study, participants administered the OT nasal

22

spray once a day (in the morning) while the majority of prior multiple-dose OT studies

23

administered two doses/day (one in the morning and one in the afternoon) (8–10, 12-14, but

24

see 11). While elevated levels of OT have been demonstrated up to 7 hours after a single-

25

dose administration (45), future studies are needed to identify at what point in time the effects

26

of intranasal administration of OT fade out and when OT levels return back to baseline. Also

27

potential interactions with diurnal patterns of endogenous OT levels need to be explored to

Long-term oxytocin effects in ASD – Bernaerts et al.
1

identify the most optimal dosing and timing of intranasal OT administrations. Third, considering

2

the adopted evaluations were predominantly based on self-report questionnaires, the

3

possibility of subjective bias cannot be ruled out. Participants’ own beliefs about the received

4

treatment, however, were assessed and inclusion of this factor did not modulate the identified

5

treatment effects. Finally, since only adult men with ASD were included, the current

6

observations of beneficial effects of OT treatment cannot be extended to women or children

7

with ASD.

8

5. Conclusions

9

To conclude, while the four-week, once-daily treatment with OT induced no treatment-specific

10

changes in primary outcome measures of social symptoms in ASD; exploratory analyses of

11

secondary outcomes showed long-lasting, medium to large-sized improvements in repetitive

12

behaviors and a reduction in perceived attachment avoidance, that outlasted the period of

13

actual administration until one month and even one-year post-treatment. Overall, the

14

observation that the OT treatment primarily targeted long-term adaptations in repetitive

15

behaviors and perceived attachment characteristics indicates that these constructs are

16

sensitive for capturing OT treatment effects in adult men with ASD. In line with the central role

17

of the human oxytocinergic system in interpersonal bonding, trust and attachment, the current

18

observations may therefore urge future multiple-dose clinical trials to continue to include

19

characterizations of attachment-related constructs when evaluating the potential of OT

20

treatment for ASD. While the exploratory observations of long-term beneficial effects of OT

21

treatment on repetitive behaviors and perceived attachment avoidance are promising, future

22

studies are warranted to further elucidate the long-term impact of OT treatment.

Data are shown as mean ± standard deviation. IQ = Intelligence Quotient, VIQ = Verbal IQ, PIQ = Performance
IQ, ADOS(-2) = Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule(-2). Detailed information on medication use and
comorbidities is provided in Additional file 3a: Table S1. Note that for one participant of the OT group only total
IQ information was available, but not VIQ or PIQ, so that the mean (± standard deviation) information of the VIQ
and PIQ of the OT group are based on data from 21 participants.

Table 2. Outcome measures and effects of oxytocin treatment. Mean pre-to-post change scores are listed separately for each treatment
group (oxytocin, placebo) and assessment session (T1, T2, T3). Cohen’s d effect sizes of between-group differences are reported separately for
each outcome measure and assessment session. T- and p-values correspond to single-sample t-tests assessing within-group changes from
baseline separately for the oxytocin and placebo group.

Profile of mood states

SRS-A = Social Responsiveness Scale adult version, RBS-R = Repetitive Behavior Scale – Revised, SAAM = State Adult Attachment Measure, IPPA =
Inventory of Parent and Peer Attachment, WHO-QOL = World Health Organization Quality of Life questionnaire. Screening for mood changes are based
on the Profile of Mood States (POMS) questionnaire. For SRS-A, RBS-R, SAAM avoidance, SAAM anxiety, and POMS tension, anger, depression and
fatigue; negative scores indicate pre-to-post improvement. Cohen’s d effect sizes (change from baselineOT–change from baselinePL)/pooled SD) are
reported where 0.2 is indicative of a small effect, 0.5 a medium effect and 0.8 a large effect. Data printed in bold show Cohen’s d effect sizes equal to or
larger than .50 (medium-sized effect).
