Abstract
Background: Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), a neurodegenerative conditions
may be difficult to discriminate clinically from idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (PD). It
is critical that we are able to do this accurately and as early as possible in order that
future disease modifying therapies for PSP may be deployed at a stage when they
are likely to have maximal benefit. Analysis of gait and related tasks is one possible
means of discrimination.
Research Question: Here we investigate a wearable sensor array coupled with
machine learning approaches as a means of disease classification.
Methods: 21 participants with PSP, 20 with PD, and 39 healthy control (HC) subjects
performed a two minute walk, static sway test, and timed up-and-go task, while
wearing an array of six inertial measurement units. The data were analysed to
determine what features discriminated PSP from PD and PSP from HC. Two machine
learning algorithms were applied, Logistic Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF).
Results: 17 features were identified in the combined dataset that contained
independent information. The RF classifier outperformed the LR classifier, and
allowed discrimination of PSP from PD with 86% sensitivity and 90% specificity, and
PSP from HC with 90% sensitivity and 97% specificity. Using data from the single
lumbar sensor only resulted in only a modest reduction in classification accuracy,
which could be restored using 3 sensors (lumbar, right arm and foot). However for
maximum specificity the full six sensor array was needed.
Significance: A wearable sensor array coupled with machine learning methods can
accurately discriminate PSP from PD. Choice of array complexity depends on
context; for diagnostic purposes a high specificity is needed suggesting the more
complete array is advantageous, while for subsequent disease tracking a simpler
system may suffice.

Introduction

Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) (1, 2) is an atypical parkinsonian disorder that
can sometimes be difficult to discriminate clinically from the much commoner
Parkinson’s disease (3). It is characterized by vertical supranuclear gaze palsy,
postural instability and axial rigidity as well as mild cognitive impairment (1) (4-6).
Recently, the Movement Disorders Society (MDS) study group has proposed a set of
diagnostic criteria for PSP, with the aim of improving the detection of the disease in
clinical practice and research (7).

Comparative studies using accelerometers (8) have shown many shared gait
abnormalities (9) (10-12) including decreases in velocity, step length, cadence, and
mean acceleration. Some differences have also been found, including lower vertical
displacement and higher acceleration in PSP. In this paper we examine the ability of
a wearable array of inertial measurement units (IMUs), coupled with machine
learning algorithms, to distinguish PSP patients from PD patients and from healthy
controls.
There are a large and growing number of wearable technologies (13, 14) available
for characterizing and measuring the motor features of neurodegenerative
diseases(15-17).
When deciding what measurement technology to use there are two major issues
that must be considered. One is the setting for the measurement, which can be
broadly divided into laboratory measurements or ambulatory measurements outside

the laboratory (e.g. at home).

The former will permit closely controlled and

supervised conditions giving the best chance of obtaining a high quality standardized
dataset, and is well suited to tasks like detailed measurement of individual
components of the gait cycle. However there is growing interest in longer term
ambulatory measurement because snapshot laboratory recordings may not give an
accurate overall picture, due to many factors such as variability of symptoms by time
of day, inconsistent timing of medication, or the stress of being tested in a hospital
environment. Laboratory measurements are also unlikely to capture infrequent but
important features such as falls or near-falls, and a ‘real world’ environment may
possibly better elicit features that are of direct clinical relevance to the patient.
The second issue is the choice of device. In particular, there is a conflict between
maximising data and minimising the effort involved in obtaining it. At one end of the
spectrum, it is possible to have body worn arrays comprising numerous inertial
measurement units attached to all four limbs and the trunk, streaming tens of
megabytes per minute. At the opposite extreme, some investigators are trying to
develop systems based on single sensors, even those built into consumer
smartphones, so that all that is required is an app running in the background. There
is no doubt that the complex systems will generate much more complete
information; the question is can the simpler systems answer the same diagnostic and
measurement questions acceptably well, despite having a comparatively meagre
dataset?
The two issues are clearly linked. Applying a complex system in a laboratory setting
is straightforward and is logical given the intent of obtaining detailed data in a
concentrated period of time. Using a complex system at home is another matter:

donning and doffing may not be easy, and the multiple sensors may get in the way of
everyday activities. There is a premium on using as simple a system as is compatible
with obtaining sufficient data to be useful.
Our aim in this study is to answer two questions. Firstly, we will use a complex
laboratory system with sensors on each limb and the trunk, to record data during
commonly applied gait-related tasks.

We will explore how well the data can

distinguish PSP patients from PD patients and from healthy control (HC) participants,
and what the most essential distinguishing features within the dataset are.
Secondly, we will analyse which sensors/body locations are necessary to acquire this
data. The aim is to determine how far the sensor array can be simplified while still
yielding satisfactory results. It is hoped that this will help maximise compliance with
future study protocols while avoiding collecting an inadequate dataset due to
oversimplification.

Materials & Methods
Participants
The participants in this study were recruited as part of the Oxford study of
Quantification in Parkinsonism (OxQUIP); a large clinical observational study being
conducted at the John Radcliffe Hospital, Oxford. We recruited 20 participants with
PD, 21 participants with PSP, and 39 healthy control participants. All healthy control
participants were spouses of the PD or PSP participants. The demographics of the
participants are summarised in Table 1.

Sensor array and software
Participants wore a system consisting of six synchronized inertial measurement units
(IMUs) (OpalTM, APDM, Portland, USA) that wirelessly transmitted data to software
(Mobility LabTM, APDM) running on a nearby laptop. The IMUs were positioned over
the lumbar spine, sternum, left and right wrists, and left and right feet. All sensors
provided tri-axial accelerometer, tri-axial gyroscope, and tri-axial magnetometer
signals at a frequency of 100Hz. Participants performed three tasks: two minute
walk, sway test, and timed up-and-go (TUG). Using the waveforms from all sensors,
the Mobility Lab software automatically extracts a range of clinical features specific
to the three tasks. A full list of the task features are provided in figure 2. The full
feature set included 109 parameters from analysis of the gait task, 33 from the sway
test, and 14 from the TUG.
Any participants taking medication were recorded in the ‘ON medication’ state.
Tasks
All participants completed a two minute walk on the same straight and level surface
to record their gait. Next, to measure sway, participants were asked to stand upright
and as still as possible for thirty seconds with their eyes closed on a firm surface. A
wooden template was placed on the floor so as to ensure all participants’ feet were
the same distance apart for the test. The TUG was then repeated three times. Each
repetition entailed the participant starting in a sitting position for three seconds,
followed by standing up when instructed, walking forward 3 metres, performing a
180 degree turn, walking back to the chair and sitting back down.

Hypothesis Testing
The first aspect of this analysis aims to identify features that demonstrate
statistically significant differences between the disease groups. Specifically, we aim
to determine whether the PSP group shows a difference to HC and PD participants in
a feature. Each participant contributes one instance in each of the three tasks. For
each task type (gait, sway, and TUG), independent t-tests are used to inspect for
statistical significance between the three disease groups for all features using a
significance level of 0.05.
Disease Classification
In order to assess to what extent PSP can be automatically discriminated from PD
and HC subjects based on the measured features, we performed automated
classification with a machine-learning algorithm. For each test, repeated 10-fold
cross validation is performed based on the full feature set from each test separately.
This means that the full dataset is split in randomly into 10 subsets, where 9 subsets
are used for training the machine learning model and the remaining subset is used as
an independent validation set. This training and validation is repeated 10 times
where each time a different independent validation set is used. Within each repeat
of cross validation, the cross sectional baseline subset undergoes minority class
balancing prior to being assigned to a fold. Within each fold, the training and
validation sets undergo zero-mean unit-variance normalisation with respect to the
mean and standard deviation of the training set. Due to the likelihood that many of
the features within each test are correlated (e.g. Gait Speed Left and Gait Speed
Right), feature selection (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, LASSO) is
performed on each training set, with the selected features subsequently being

extracted from the validation set. Two classifiers were used. A Logistic Regression
(LR) classifier was used due to its popularity in the clinical field. A Random Forest
(RF) classifier was also used, without feature reduction as Random Forest classifiers
are known to deal well with a high dimensional feature set. We report the accuracy,
sensitivity, and specificity for each task separately and all tasks combined.
Reduced sensor set
In order to assess the necessity or not of using a large sensor set, we took the
features selected by LASSO for all tasks combined and assessed from which sensor
those features are computed. We then repeated the classification procedure using
only those features extracted from the lumbar sensor, because this sensor alone
accounted for a majority of the features identified by LASSO. We further repeated
the classification using data obtainable from the lumbar sensor plus the right arm
and right leg sensors, and reported the same performance metrics.

Results
Participants
The demographics, clinical characteristics, and rating scale scores of the participants
for each group are shown in table 1.
Figure 1 shows the distributions of some of the feature values extracted from the
three tasks that were found to differ significantly between PSP and the two other
groups. The box plots show the range of values for each of these features in each
participant group, with individual data points overlaid in grey. Note that there is
considerable redundancy amongst the large number of features, and not all
measurements that were found to be significant individually emerged from the
LASSO as independent predictors. For example in the sway test, mean coronal sway
velocity was individually significant, but this did not feature in the LASSO result.
Table 2 shows the disease classification accuracy under a number of conditions. The
upper three rows of the table show the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of
discrimination between PSP and PD and between PSP and HC, for each of the three
tasks separately as indicated in the left column. It can be seen that of the three
tasks, sway is much less effective than the other two at discriminating between PSP
and PD. The fourth row of table 2 gives the results of analysing the combined feature
set from all three tasks; this performs better than any of the 3 tasks individually.
It is clear that the RF classifier performs better than the LR classifier overall. When
distinguishing PSP from PD the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of RF was as good
as or better than LR in every condition in the table. The greatest difference was 15

percentage points in specificity using the combined tasks and full sensor set (75%
with LR versus 90% with RF).
Table 3 lists the features that emerged from the LASSO analysis of the combined
tasks as the most important discriminators between the groups, with their
weightings and which sensor in the array the data are obtained from in each case.
Notably, the lumbar sensor provides the data for ten of the seventeen features in
this list, compared to just one feature that is dependent on the sternal sensor. This
prompts one to ask what the results would be if the lumbar sensor were used alone.
The answer (table 2 row 5) is that using only one sensor in the lumbar position
reduces the accuracy of both classifiers modestly, from 80% to 78% with LR and from
88% to 85% with RF.
We then explored the effect of adding one arm and one leg sensor to the lumbar
sensor, making a three sensor array including lumbar, right arm and right foot.
Where LASSO had identified left sided parameter we substituted the equivalent
parameter from the opposite side, making the assumption that, for example,
cadence measured from either leg would report a similar value. Using this
intermediate size network, the accuracy with both classifiers was the same as for the
full six sensor network (table 2 row 6). Notably however, the high specificity (90%)
observed with the 6 sensor network was reduced to 85% with the lumbar sensor
alone, and this was not recovered using 3 sensors.

Discussion
We have shown that it is possible with a body-worn IMU array and machine learning
methods to differentiate PSP from PD and PSP from control, with a high degree of
accuracy. In order to ensure the robustness of these findings we used separate
training and validation datasets for the analysis, and to provide validation we used
two different classification algorithms. Overall, the Random Forest classifier
performed better than the Logistic Regression classifier. LR is probably the most
commonly used classifier in biomedical research and therefore the apparent
superiority of RF is an important finding.
A recent review found 78 published studies of IMU based gait analysis, but only 16%
of these used more than one sensor (18). We found just two previous studies looking
at gait in PSP. One of these used a single IMU in the lumbar region (8), and detected
only a difference in vertical displacement during gait between PSP and PD. The
other used two sensors, one attached to each foot (19), and identified significant
differences in gait speed and cadence. In both cases the information obtained is far
less detailed than that obtained from multiple sensors in the present study.
As expected there is a high degree of redundancy in the measured features within
and across the three tasks used. This is well illustrated by the fact that, for example,
the mean velocity of postural sway in the coronal plane was significantly and
substantially different between PSP and the other groups, yet did not occur as an
independent predictor in the feature set selected by the LASSO analysis. Indeed only
one sway variable was found to contain independent information.

From the point of view of overall classification accuracy, it may be possible to
simplify the sensor array. Of the 17 key parameters identified by the LASSO analysis,
10 could be obtained from just the lumbar sensor. In distinguishing PSP from HC,
the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity using just this sensor was virtually identical
to that obtained using the full sensor array. Using just the lumbar sensor did degrade
performance in terms of test accuracy when differentiating PSP from PD, but only
modestly (for the RF classifier there was a test accuracy of 88% with six sensors
versus 85% with the lumbar sensor only). Using an intermediate 3 sensor array
(lumbar, right arm, right foot) gave a test accuracy as good as the full six sensor
array.
In some respects however the most important parameter is specificity, because a
higher specificity increases positive predictive value (PPV), which is critical if PSP
specific treatments are to be initiated based on the result. The specificity of 90%
using the 6 sensor array and the RF classifier is remarkably good. Previous biomarker
studies using diverse approaches have not yielded specificities as high as this. For
example, MRI morphometry of the brainstem gave a specificity of 85%(20), while a
meta-analysis of studies of probably the most promising CSF biomarker,
neurofilament light chain, gave a specificity of 81%(21).

Because of the low

prevalence of PSP amongst patients presenting with parkinsonism, even the higher
85% figure translated into a PPV of just 57% (20). The improvement in PPV between
a test with 85% and 90% specificity is substantial. In moving from the full 6 sensors
to just the lumbar sensor, the 90% specificity of our RF classifier fell to 85%, an
important reduction in efficacy. Performance was not restored by adding in two
more sensors.

It should be noted that the job that the classifiers were asked to do in this study is
considerably easier than the applications to which we hope the approach will
ultimately extend. It is no surprise to see classification accuracies in excess of 90%
when discriminating PSP patients from controls. The fact that the classification
accuracy between PSP and PD was not far behind (88% with RF) may seem
impressive, but we began with groups of clear-cut PSP and PD, who would be readily
distinguishable clinically by an experienced movement disorders neurologist. For the
technique to be most useful, it must do something that such a person finds
challenging. The performance differential between more complete and simpler
sensor sets may well widen with more difficult questions and will need to be
carefully evaluated in each situation.
The most obvious next step in testing this approach would be to evaluate its
effectiveness in the differential diagnosis of these conditions at an earlier stage,
when there is still substantial clinical diagnostic uncertainty. This will require the
capture of a large incident cohort of parkinsonian patients, in order that it turns out
eventually to contain sufficient numbers of cases that manifest as PSP, rather than
the far commoner PD. The other task that could benefit from the machine learning
approach is the related one of disease severity quantification and progression
tracking. This is an area of great interest because objective numerical biomarkers
capable of doing this in PSP (and PD) are lacking, yet very much needed for trials of
potential disease modifying drugs.
In conclusion, the answer to the question of whether the sensor network can be
simplified depends on context and the exact parameters we are interested in. It may
be that the more complex sensor array is better suited to the diagnostic setting,

quantification and tracking once the diagnosis is secure.

Table 2. Classification results when automatically classifying different patients based on their gait,
sway, and TUG signatures using the entire six-sensor array (first three rows of table). Sway is the least
informative test. Classification accuracy is improved when the feature sets from all three tasks are
merged (fourth row). The Random Forest (RF) classifier performs better than the logistic regression
(LR) classifier. Using data from the lumbar sensor alone (row 5) reduces accuracy modestly, but this can
be recovered by adding back in arm and foot sensors from one side of the body (last row of table). The
high specificity of PSP versus PD classification obtained with RF (90%) is only seen when using the 6
sensor array.

Table 3. Key parameters emerging from LASSO analysis discriminating PSP from PD and HC subjects,
together with their relative importance (as reflected by the weights). The ‘sensor’ column explains which
of the sensors in the array is responsible for collecting the data described, and the activity column on the
left shows during which test the feature has been collected. The three columns on the right show how
much of the feature set is available depending on the extent of sensor array used.
