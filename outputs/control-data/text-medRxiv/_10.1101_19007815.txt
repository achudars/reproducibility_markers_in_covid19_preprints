Abstract

28

Purpose: An association between antibody deficiency and clozapine use in individuals with

29

Schizophrenia has recently been reported. We hypothesized that if clozapine-associated

30

hypogammaglobulinaemia was clinically relevant this would manifest in referral patterns.

31

Methods: Retrospective case note review of patients referred and assessed by Immunology

32

Centre for Wales (ICW) between January 2005 and July 2018 with extraction of clinical and

33

immunologic features for individuals with diagnosis of schizophrenia-like illness.

34

Results: 1791 adult patients were assessed at ICW during this period; 23 patients had a

35

psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorder. Principal indications for

36

referral were findings of low calculated globulin and immunoglobulins. Clozapine was the

37

single most commonly prescribed antipsychotic (17/23), disproportionately increased

38

relative to reported use in the general schizophrenia population (OR 6.48, 95% CI: 1.79 to

39

23.5). Clozapine therapy was noted in 6/7 (86%) of patients subsequently requiring

40

immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT). Marked reduction of class-switched memory

41

B-cells (CSMB) and plasmablasts were observed in clozapine-treated individuals relative to

42

healthy age-matched controls. Clozapine duration is associated with CSMB decline. One

43

patient discontinued clozapine, with gradual recovery of IgG levels without use of IgRT.

44

Conclusion: Our findings are consistent with enrichment of clozapine-treatment within

45

schizophrenic individuals referred for ICW assessment over the last 13 years. These

46

individuals displayed clinical patterns closely resembling the primary immunodeficiency

47

CVID, however appears reversible upon drug cessation. This has diagnostic, monitoring and

48

treatment implications for psychiatry and immunology teams and directs prospective

49

studies to address causality and the wider implications for this patient group.

Introduction:

61

Schizophrenia is an enduring major psychiatric disorder affecting around 1% of the

62

population (1). In addition to the

63

psychosocial consequences with an unemployment rate of 80-90% and a life expectancy

64

reduced by 10-20 years (1) including suicide rates of approximately 5% (2). Societal costs in

65

England alone are estimated to be £11·8 billion per year (3). Clozapine is a dibenzo-

66

diazepine atypical antipsychotic and the only licensed medication, for approximately 30% of

67

patients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia (TRS) (1, 4). There is increasing evidence

68

linking clozapine with pneumonia-related admissions (5-7) and mortality (8-11). Postulated

69

mechanisms include sialorrhoea, sedation, agranulocytosis, and aspiration. We recently

70

reported

71

hypogammaglobulinemia (12, 13), greater than that reported following rituximab and

72

methotrexate therapy in rheumatoid arthritis (14). To better define the clinical and

73

immunologic abnormalities associated with clozapine use we performed a retrospective

74

case review of patients assessed at the Immunology Centre for Wales (ICW).

75

Methods

76

Electronic case records for patients assessed at ICW between January 2005 and July 2018 to

77

identify all individuals with a concomitant psychiatric diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizo-

78

affective disorder. Indication for referral, medication, and co-morbidities, and

79

immunological testing at initial assessment and treatments were extracted using a

80

standardised proforma. Recurrent infection history was defined as ≥3 distinct antibiotic

81

courses per year or serious infection requiring admission, as in the wider literature (15).

111

Enrichment of clozapine-treated patients within schizophrenia cases referred for immunology
assessment and requiring immunoglobulin replacement therapy.

112

During the evaluation period 1791 adults were assessed at ICW; 23 had a diagnosis of

113

schizophrenia or schizo-affective disorders. We hypothesized that if clozapine-associated

114

hypogammaglobulinaemia was clinically relevant this would manifest in referral patterns.

115

The mean clozapine prescription rate reported by the 2014 UK National Audit of

116

Schizophrenia was 30% (17). We therefore expected a ratio of 7 Clozapine: 16 non-clozapine

117

users. In contrast, we observed 17 patients with a history of clozapine use, corresponding to

118

an odds ratio (OR) of 6.48 (95% CI: 1.79 to 23.5), p = 0.0072. This remained significant for

119

prevalence estimates of clozapine use among the Welsh schizophrenia population up to 43%

120

(Supplementary, S2). Patients receiving clozapine accounted for 6/7 (86%) of schizophrenia

121

cases requiring IgRT, approximately 3% of our adult IgRT cohort. This compares to the

122

international schizophrenia prevalence of 0.4-1% (18, 19). This suggests enrichment of

123

clozapine-treated patients within our immunodeficiency cohort relative to the general

124

population.

125

We next explored indication for referral and immunological finding at first assessment

126

(individual patient details summarised- Supplementary, S1). Two clozapine-treatment

127

patient with hypogammaglobulinaemia have been previously identified and reported (12).

128

Recurrent infection was documented in 10/17 subjects (59%), predominately reflecting

129

sinopulmonary infections. Four patients (24%) were referred with serum antibody levels

below the 5th percentile without any antibiotic use in the preceding 12 months

131

(summarised- Table 1). A low calculated globulin (CG) (<23g/L) was present in 15/17 (88%)

132

of subjects receiving clozapine and was associated with reductions in IgG, IgA, and IgM

133

below the 5th percentiles in 14/17 subjects. We also found referral rates increased

134

following the national introduction of CG screening to Wales during 2014, and prior to

135

release of our initial report (12) (Supplementary, S3). Consistent with CG reduction, serum

136

immunoglobulin levels were also reduced – summarised in Figure 1. Taken together, this is

137

consistent with a clozapine-specific association with dysgammaglobulinaemia, and the

138

utility of calculated globulin screening to stratify patients for specialist immunology

139

assessment.

153

underlying clozapine-associated hypogammaglobulinaemia remain unknown, we focused on

B-cell clinical immunophenotyping data performed in isolation or as part of a full EUROClass

156

individuals with CVID (n=26) and healthy controls (n=16) to clozapine-treated patients

157

(following exclusion of cases with haematological malignancy, n=15). Clozapine-treated

158

individuals showed normal total B-cell counts but reduction of class-switched memory B-

159

cells (CSMB) relative to healthy individuals (Mann-Whitney p< 0.0001), with the exception of

160

a single patient who had discontinued clozapine after a 2-month trial and had normal

161

immunoglobulin levels (Figure 2; Supplementary S2). We observed a general decline in

162

CSMB with increasing duration of clozapine therapy. Immunophenotyping of plasmablasts

163

was available for 6 individuals receiving clozapine and was comparable to CVID but

164

significantly reduced compared to age-matched healthy controls (Mann-Whitney, p=0.004).

177

Reduction in infection burden following immunoglobulin replacement therapy

178

Our approach to antibody deficiency follows that previously reported (15, 20). Cumulative

179

follow-up for clozapine-associated hypogammaglobulinaemia now exceeds 61 patient-years

180

(range 0.5-11 years), during which time 6/16 (38%) of clozapine-treated patients were

181

commenced on IgRT. Over a 12-month period prior to replacement, these patients received

182

a mean of 6.5 acute antibiotic courses (range 3-12, including 1 inpatient admission requiring

183

parenteral therapy). Following IgRT, this fell to a median of 1.5 oral antibiotics courses per

184

year (range 0-2 courses), with no infection-triggered hospital admissions. Replacement

185

trough IgG levels ranged from 5.5 to 9.6g/L (mean 8.0g/L).

186

Partial recovery of immunoglobulin following clozapine discontinuation

187

One patient (supplementary table S1: IDs#7) discontinued clozapine due to the known side-

188

effect of neutropenia, detected by the clozapine monitoring program, providing a unique

189

opportunity to examine reversibility of humoral dysregulation. In the absence of IgRT

190

Patient #7 has demonstrated a gradual recovery in terms of serum IgG level from 3.5g/L to

191

5.95g/L over 3 years, however IgA and IgM levels have remained depressed (Figure 3).

192

Patient #2 discontinued clozapine 2 years ago, having already commenced IgRT, with

193

subsequent recovery of IgM from 0.22 to 0.86. IgA levels have remained below 0.24g/L.

194

Together this provides support for reversibility in humoral function following clozapine-

195

withdrawal, but suggests this process is gradual and limited. In contrast, clozapine cessation

196

in patient #2 was associated with profound and acute relapse of psychiatric symptoms,

197

requiring prolonged inpatient admission to a specialist mental health unit.

Discussion

203

In this retrospective review of referrals to a national immunology centre, we found that

204

individuals with schizophrenia receiving clozapine displayed clinically

205

panhypogammaglobulinemia, impaired vaccine responses and disturbed B cell maturation

206

with a proportion benefitting from IgRT. Consistent with a specific relationship to clozapine-

207

use, we observed enrichment of clozapine-use amongst schizophrenia patients undergoing

208

immunology assessment or requiring IgRT relative to that reported in the wider population

209

by a number of recent studies (4, 17, 24). The most common feature at referral was a low

210

calculated globulin (25). Importantly, both clozapine and non-clozapine antipsychotic

211

medications require routine liver function monitoring (26), arguing against a referral-bias

212

due to differential testing. While the use of calculated globulin screening is being developed

213

in a number of countries, a lack of wider availability may limit the identification of antibody

214

deficient patients taking clozapine in other settings (25, 27, 28).

215

Our finding of a temporal association between clozapine use and reduction in CSMB is

216

consistent with our previous analysis of a separate cohort that hypogammaglobulinaemia

217

appears a late manifestation of clozapine therapy (12). Our immunological findings

218

associated with clozapine-associated hypogammaglobulinaemia is independently supported

219

by a recently reported peripheral blood immune signature for TRS patients revealing

220

reduced plasmablasts and CSMB relative to disease and healthy controls (29). Whilst this

221

study focused on psychiatric status, the majority of such patients were clozapine-treated;

222

immunoglobulin levels were not determined by this group (29). These findings also suggest

223

that many clozapine-treated patients in our cohort and beyond may have received a

11

significant

224

diagnosis of CVID, according to internationally-accepted criteria (30). We are conducting a

225

wider survey of UK Immunology centres to examine this observation.

226

This study has several limitations, including its sample size and single-centre retrospective

227

design. Prospective studies are required, for instance to validate the association between

228

therapy duration and effect on B-cell phenotypes, and to address causality. We speculate an

229

effect targeting late stage B-cell differentiation or survival may underlie the observed

230

findings (31). However, at present, we cannot exclude a link to the underlying

231

pathophysiology of schizophrenia- which like CVID remains largely unknown. Intriguingly,

232

pathway analysis of schizophrenia associations have demonstrated marked enrichment at

233

enhancers active in immune tissues, particularly B-lymphocyte lineages (32). Polypharmacy,

234

multi-morbidity, and socio-economic status are common and important factors complicating

235

healthcare delivery in schizophrenia (33, 34) and might also contribute to the observed

236

findings. Smoking is common in both clozapine-treated and clozapine-naïve schizophrenia

237

patients (35), predisposes to pneumonia (36), and may lead to systemic steroid therapy for

238

chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder. However, the reduced CSMB and pan-

239

hypogammaglobulinaemia profiles we observed clearly differ from the patterns previously

240

reported with both steroids or smoking (37, 38). Other medication including metformin and

241

anti-epileptics have been described to have immunomodulatory effects in murine studies

242

(39) or case series (40) however do not fully explain the observed hypogammaglobulinaemia

243

- in line with the rigorous exclusion criteria applied during our initial case-control study (12).

244

The immunomodulatory effects of the dibenzodiazepine clozapine are increasingly

245

recognised beyond agranulocytosis and neutropenia (41-43). Here, we present evidence of

246

gradual recovery of humoral immune function following clozapine withdrawal in the

247

absence of IgRT.

248

From a practical standpoint, recovery of immunoglobulin levels appeared gradual and

249

variable. Weighed against the florid relapse in psychiatric symptoms observed following

250

clozapine discontinuation in one, we do not currently suggest discontinuation of clozapine in

251

patients. This is in line with the unique efficacy of clozapine in TRS (44), and availability of

252

treatment options to mitigate the risks associated with antibody deficiency. Finally, given

253

evidence of increased risk of pneumonia within individuals with schizophrenia (7, 45, 46) our

254

finding of low levels of baseline immunity to common vaccinations within this patient group

255

highlights a simple strategy for risk mitigation.

256

Summary

257

We report the clinical features of clozapine-associated immunodeficiency identified

258

following the introduction of calculated globulin screening in Wales and highlight clinically

259

significant panhypogammaglobulinemia, impaired vaccine responses, and new findings of

260

disturbed B-cell maturation. In support of a drug-related effect we show a temporal

261

association between clozapine exposure and reduction in CSMB levels, and evidence of

262

gradual reversibility following discontinuation. Clinicians should be alert for this diagnostic

263

overlap with CVID. Patients may benefit from monitoring or clinical intervention in the form

264

of vaccination, antibiotic prophylaxis, or immunoglobulin replacement therapy (IgRT).

265

Clozapine’s immunomodulatory effects are poorly understood, and further studies are

266

required to delineate mechanism.

What does this article add to our knowledge?

276

-

Hypogammaglobulinaemia associated with TRS-patients receiving clozapine can

277

result in a serious and significant infection burden which in Immunodeficiency Clinic

278

assessment was associated with impaired vaccine responses, low class-switched

279

memory B-cells and plasmablasts resembling primary immunodeficiency. Patients

280

often required intervention in the form of antibiotic prophylaxis and/or

281

immunoglobulin replacement (IgRT).

282

-

How does this study impact current management guidelines?

283

-

Clinicians need to be aware of the association between clozapine and antibody

284

deficiency. Such patients may currently be diagnosed with CVID.

285

-

286

Current clozapine monitoring does not include antibody testing however calculated
globulin may be a helpful screening tool.

287

-

288

A number of potential interventions may help risk mitigate clozapine-associated
antibody deficiency.

Kudos Plain Language Summary:

493

The introduction of clozapine in the 1950s was a major therapeutic advance in the

494

treatment of schizophrenia. It remains the gold standard therapy for approximately 3/10

495

individuals who fail to respond to initial management. Overall clozapine improves symptoms

496

and saves lives. Recent studies (2018) have suggested that clozapine therapy may be

497

associated with a block in antibody production (causing antibody-deficiency). This would

498

predict patients receiving this therapy to be more likely to experience infections (such as

499

pneumonia). This work examines patients referred to a major immunology centre since

500

2005, with focus on those receiving antipsychotic medicines (including clozapine). As

501

predicted by the authors (but against the normal pattern of prescribing), clozapine was the

502

most common antipsychotic used by patients referred with antibody deficiency. The authors

503

go on to define the clinical and immunological features of this group, highlighting a close

similarity to individuals without a known cause of antibody deficiency. Several clozapine-

505

treated patients went on to receive antibody replacement therapy, successfully reducing

506

their infection rate. By following these patients over time, they also saw that in one patient

507

who stopped clozapine treatment that this was associated with a gradual return in their

508

major antibody (IgG). This adds support to the argument that clozapine therapy is

509

associated with a drug-related (secondary) antibody deficiency. This is an important finding

510

for immunologists around the work, who could easily confuse a drug-related cause of

511

antibody deficiency with an inherited (primary) case. The authors remain cautious and

512

suggest further studies are needed with greater size and following patients before and after

513

they start/stop clozapine. This is because the disease processes underlying both

514

schizophrenia and primary antibody deficiency remain largely unknown: meaning there

515

could be important shared mechanisms linking both conditions.
