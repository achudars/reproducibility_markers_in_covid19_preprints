Abstract

Dyslipidemia is a potential complication of long-term usage of antiretroviral therapy (ART)
and also known to be associated with genetic factors. The host genetic variants associated
with dyslipidemia in HIV patients on ART in Ghana have not been fully explored. The study
constituted a total of 289 HIV-infected patients on stable ART for at least a year and 85

aged matched apparently healthy control subjects with no history of HIV and dyslipidemia.
Fasting blood was collected into EDTA tube for lipids measurements. Lipid profiles were
determined as a measure of dyslipidemia. HIV-infected patients were categorized into two
groups; those with dyslipidemia(HIV-Dys+) (n=90; 31.1%) and without dyslipidemia
(n=199; 68.9%) based on the NCEP-ATP III criteria. Four candidate single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) genes (ABCA1-rs2066714, LDLR-rs6511720, APOA5-rs662799 and
DSCAML1-rs10892151) were determined. Genotyping was performed on isolated genomic
DNA of study participants using PCR followed by a multiplex Ligation Detection Reaction
(LDR). The percentage of the population who had the rare homozygote alleles for
rs6511720 (T/T), rs2066714 (G/G), and rs10892151 (T/T) and rs662799 (G/G) among
HIV+Dys+ subjects were 5.5%, 14.4%, 6.6% and 10.0%; 2.0% 9.1%, 6.5% and 4.0% among
HIV+Dys- subjects while 3.5%, 4.7%, 4.7% and 2.4% were observed in HIV-Dys- subjects.
Statistically significant difference in genotypic prevalence of APOA5 polymorphisms was
observed among different groups (p=0.0196). Compared to the AA genotype of the APOA5
polymorphisms, individuals with the rare homozygote genotype [aOR =4.01, 95%CI(1.5722.39), p=0.004] were significantly more likely to develop dyslipidemia after controlling
for age, gender, treatment duration and CD4 counts among the HIV+Dys+ subjects. There
was also a significant associated between GG genotype of ABCA1 and dyslipidemia [aOR
=3.29, 95% (1.08 -12.43); p=0.042] . Individuals with the rare homozygote variant (GG) of
APOA5 (rs662799) were significantly associated with increased likelihood of developing
dyslipidemia [OR =2.24, 95% CI (1.20 -6.83); p=0.0370] holding other variables constant
in the HIV+Dys- subjects. Our data accentuate the presence of SNPs in four candidate genes
and its association with dyslipidemia among HIV patients exposed to ART in the Ghanaian
population especially variants in APOA5-rs662799 ABCA1-rs2066714 respectively. These
findings provide baseline information that necessitates a pre-symptomatic strategy for
monitoring dyslipidemia in ART-treated HIV patients. There is a need for longitudinal
studies to validate a comprehensive number of SNPs and its association with dyslipidemia.

Introduction

Global estimates report 37 million people living with Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV), out of which about 26 million reside in Sub-Saharan (SSA) [1]. In Ghana, HIV
prevalence among adults aged 15-49 years has declined from about 2.4% in 2013 to 1.6%
in 2015 according to the World Bank report [2]. The life expectancy of HIV-infected
patients has increased remarkably due to the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) as a
standard of care [3-5]. Unfortunately, long term ART use is associated with a wide

spectrum of metabolic disturbances such as lipodystrophy, insulin resistance, and
dyslipidemia [6-8]. Dyslipidemia is defined by elevations in total cholesterol, low-density
lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides and decreased high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (HDL-C).
The prevalence of dyslipidemia is reportedly higher in people living with HIV due to the
effect of ART in Ghana [9-11]. The severity of dyslipidemia and the typical pattern of the
lipid profile differ between and within the classes of antiretroviral (ARV) agents [12]. Lipid
abnormalities have been reported to be frequently associated with HIV-infected individuals
receiving protease inhibitors (PIs) and treatment-na√Øve HIV-infected patients, suggesting
that HIV infection itself has a metabolic deleterious effect. Such reported side effects are
not universal to all individuals on ART and may even vary in individuals with comparable
ART, demographic, immunologic and virological characteristics [12-14]. This variability
suggests that genetic factors and inherited predispositions may have a significant influence
on the incidence of metabolic dysfunction [14, 15]. However, high HDL cholesterol and
apolipoprotein A-I (APOA-I) have been directly associated with a better immunological
outcome [16].
Low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR), positioned on chromosome 19p13.2 plays a
significant role lipoprotein metabolism by mediating the uptake of cholesterol through the
binding and subsequent cellular uptake of apolipoprotein-E and B- constituting
lipoproteins. Mutations have been detected in different domains of the LDLR which have
distinct effect on LDLR structure and function [17, 18]. ATP-binding cassette A1(ABCA1)
plays critical role in reverse cholesterol transport system. Mutation in ABCA1, that encodes
this protein, along with genes responsible for their transcription regulation, can lead to
abnormality in the metabolism of lipids [19, 20]. Apolipoprotein A5 (APOA5) has been
shown to be a key regulator of plasma triglycerides and there are several SNPs associated
with the APOA5 gene [21, 22]. Moreover, HIV-infected patients who harbour
polymorphisms of the DSCAML1 (Down syndrome cell adhesion molecule like-1) gene
exhibit a less favourable lipids profile [23, 24]. Current studies have suggested the
relationship between the level of lipids and LDLR, ABCA1 APOA5, and DSCAML1
polymorphisms [15, 25].
Nevertheless, the exact mechanism of dyslipidemia is not fully understood but is most
likely multifactorial with the genetic variation being shown to account for about 43-83% of
the variability of plasma lipoprotein levels in a normal healthy population [16, 26].
Therefore, from the genetic perspective, HAART-associated hyperlipidemia could be under
the influence of various forms of genetic polymorphisms, similar to that in non-HIV adults
[27, 28]. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that could account for a
significant portion of the variation of blood lipoprotein concentrations have been identified
through recent candidate gene studies and genome-wide association studies (GWAS)[15,
29].
The association between gene polymorphisms that may signal a predisposition to lipid
abnormalities and clinical progression of HIV infection has not been thoroughly studied in
Africa where the prevalence of HIV is on the increase. SNP prevalence differs by population

and at present, the majority of the SNP-associated dyslipidemic studies among HIV patients
have come from non-African countries with only a few of these studies emanating from
Africa [15, 24, 30]. To the best of our knowledge, no published study has explored the
genetic variants and markers associated with dyslipidemia in HIV-infected individuals on
HAART in a Ghanaian population. This study, therefore, investigated the distribution of
SNPs in four candidate genes that have had significant published lipid associations and
their resultant associations with plasma lipid levels in Ghanaian HIV-infected patients on
HAART. An understanding of the impact of host genetic factors on the prevalence of
dyslipidemia in a cohort of HIV-infected individuals on HAART would promote
interventions in the scaling up of treatment regimen.

Material and Methods
Study design and subjects

This study comprised HIV-1 infected patients who were on ART regimen for at least one
year, with either a protease inhibitor (PI) or non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase
inhibitor (NNRTI) backbone and age-matched HIV seronegative subjects with no history
of HIV, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes The HIV seronegative subjects were
referred to as ‚Äúapparent healthy control‚Äù since their nutritional status, diet and quality of
life were not assessed in this study. The adjuvant antiretroviral drugs were stavudine,
lamivudine, and zidovudine with priorities for inclusion being given to participants who
consented to undergo biochemical and genetic testing. Pregnant women, patients being
treated with lipid-lowering drugs and those with neurological conditions that prevented
them from understanding the concept of the research were excluded from the study.
Sample size determination

Based on previous report from a study conducted on the burden of dyslipidemia among
adults in Ghanaian a population [31] and the lack of knowledge of the frequency of
polymorphisms in the population, we assumed an expected proportion of 0.1 for exposure
in HIV seronegative subjects, an assumed odds ratio of 2, a confidence interval of 95%, a
power of identifying a significant difference between two groups, and 1:3 ratio, a total of
396 subjects were recruited. This comprised of 289 cases HIV seropositive (HIV+) subjects
and 104 HIV seronegative (HIV-) subjects.
Data collection and biochemical analysis

A structured questionnaire was administered to each patient to obtain demographic
information. Details on ARVs, time of diagnosis, duration on ARVs, CD4 counts were
obtained from the medical folders of the patients. Fasting blood samples were collected for
the analysis of lipid parameters and genomic DNA.
Blood samples were taken after an overnight (12-14 hours) fast into EDTA tubes for
biochemical analysis. Fasting lipid panel including total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol

and triglycerides (TG) were measured using Flexor junior (Vital Scientific, Dieren,
Netherlands) chemistry autoanalyzer. LDL-C was calculated from the Friedewald‚Äôs formula,
LDL-C= TC- (HDL-C- TG/2.2). Patient with triglycerides above 4.52 mmol/L was not
included in the study since LDL-C was not directly measured and due to the deficit of the
Friedewald‚Äôs equation, which overestimates LDL-C levels when triglycerides are high. This
is to reduce any bias that might affect the relationship found between LDL-C and
dyslipidemia. The NCEP-ATP III criteria were used to define dyslipidemia as reduced HDL
(<1.03 mmol/L in males; <1.29 mmol/L in females), raised TG ‚â•1.7 mmol/L, TC >6.2
mmol/L and LDL-C >3.37 mmol/L or specific treatment for such lipid abnormalities [32].
Anthropometric and hemodynamic measures

Anthropometric measures such as weight and height were performed using an automated
weighing scale. Portable height rod stadiometers were used for height measurements to
the nearest centimeter. Body mass index (BMI) was defined as weight (kg)/height (m)2.
Blood pressure was measured using an automated sphygmomanometer (Omron M7 Intelli
IT). Three consecutive readings of blood pressure measurements were taken from the
patients‚Äô right arm and the mean of two closest values was recorded.
Single nucleotide polymorphisms selection and Genotyping

The four candidate SNPs (rs2066714, rs6511720, rs662799, and rs10892151) selected for
this study have been shown in previous studies to be significantly associated with lipid
serum abnormalities following a review of GWAS and PubMed reports of SNPs associated
with dyslipidemia among HIV-infected individuals [24, 33-35]. Genomic DNA was isolated
from EDTA-collected whole blood samples of study participants using the Qiagen midi kit
prep as per manufacturer‚Äôs protocol. Genotyping was carried out on isolated genomic DNA
of study participants using a multiplex ligation detection reaction (LDR), a sequencespecific genotyping method that has been used efficiently in polymorphism typing and
detection of mutations in disease genes [36]. Triplex multiplex reaction assays were setup
with products being run on 10% polyacrylamide gel for LDR genotype observation (58 to
90 base pairs). The LDR products differed in sizes of about 8 base pairs for each triplex (Fig.
1). The runs were controlled with Amelogenin XY (AME XY) to determine a successful
reaction and gender-confirming for study participants.
As shown in Fig. 1, allele specific LDR products are assigned by color and size following 10%
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each band as shown in the image represents a specific
genotype of each allele. At the bottom of the gel are leftover LDR probes from the reaction
mix as represented by shared common bands

Technology, Kumasi, Ghana. All participants gave written informed consent and were
assured that the information gathered was to be used strictly for research and academic
purpose only. In addition, respondents were given the freedom to opt-out at any time they
thought they could not continue with the study.
Data management and statistical Analysis

The NCEP-ATP III criteria were used to defined dyslipidemia among the HIV seropositive
and seronegative subjects respectively [32]. The HIV seropositive subjects were
categorized into two groups; those with dyslipidemia (HIV+Dys+) and without
dyslipidemia (HIV+Dys-). Similar categorization was done among the HIV seronegative
subjects thus HIV seronegative with dyslipidemia (HIV-Dys+) and without dyslipidemia
(HIV-Dys-). However, HIV-Dys+ subjects were excluded from the study since individuals
with no history of HIV, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and diabetes were recruited as
apparent healthy control. Therefore, nineteen HIV seronegative with dyslipidemia were
excluded from the database, allowing for analysis to be performed in 85 apparently healthy
control subjects. This was to strengthen the conclusion of the findings reported in this
study.
Microsoft Excel software was used to set up a database, and to avoid entry error, the
double-entry method was used, and data were analyzed using SPSS version 25 and R
program where appropriately. Parametric continuous were analyzed with t-test and
expressed as mean ¬± standard deviation (SD) after checking for normality with
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. ANOVA was used to compare continuous variables from more
than two groups with Yates post-test, the chi-square test was to compare differences
between more than three groups for categorical variables while Fisher exact was used to
assess differences between two groups for categorical variables Allele frequencies were
estimated by gene counting. Deviations in the genotype frequencies from the HardyWeinberg equilibrium (HWE) were tested using the chi-square (œá2) analysis. Initial
univariate binary logistic models were performed to determine the association between
SNPs and dyslipidemia, followed by adjusted multivariate binary logistic models
controlling for age, gender, BMI, CD4 counts and duration of HIV infection. Adjusted
multivariate binary logistic models were used also to identify SNPs independently
associated with lipid abnormalities holding confounding variables constant. A p-value of
less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results

Long term usage of ART has been implicated in several metabolic effects including
dyslipidemia. However, this side effect varies among individuals on ART with comparable
clinical and demographic characteristics. As such, inherited predispositions and genetic
factors have been implicated in the cause of this metabolic alteration. The present study,
therefore, assessed the prevalence of SNPs and its association with dyslipidemia in HIV
patients on ART in Ghana. Four candidate SNPs (rs2066714, rs6511720, rs662799, and
rs10892151) reviewed from PubMed were analyzed for associations with dyslipidemia
among HIV-infected individuals.
Several studies have shown an association between dyslipidemia and HIV patients on ART
[37, 38]. In the present study, the prevalence rate of dyslipidemia among HIV patients on
ART was 31.1% with low HDL-C

and high TC levels being the commonest lipid

abnormalities. The observed prevalence of dyslipidemia is comparable to the range of
reports from previous studies by Obirikorang et al.[9] and Ngala et al. [10] in Ghana and
Kodogo et al. [10] in Zimbabwe. However, it is lower compared to 78.9% prevalence rate
reported by Limas et al. [39] in a cross-sectional study among Brazilian HIV individuals on
ART. Furthermore, our findings of low HDL-C and high total cholesterol and LDL-C among
HIV patients on ART are consistent with other studies [40, 41]. Results from the present
study revealed that subjects who received PI-based treatment had significantly increased
levels of total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides compared to non-PI-based
subjects. This is consistent with several case reports [42, 43] and cross-sectional studies
[44, 45] which have reported that PI exposures are associated with hypercholesterolemia
and hypertriglyceridemia.
Our study demonstrated that the presence of the homozygous recessive/mutant genes for

LDLR, ABCA1, DSCAML1 and APOA5 genotypes among our study participants were very
low [Table 2]. Similar low frequencies in APOA5
were reported by Lazzaretti et al.

and LDLR homozygotes mutant genes

[15] in a cross-sectional study among

HIV-infected

patients on ART in the Brazilians population. Genome-wide associations studies have
identified LDL-R SNP rs6511720 (G>T), which is located in intron-1 of the gene, to be
associated with lower plasma levels of LDL-C and a lower risk of CHD [35]. Data from the
GLGC consortium suggested that

LDLR rs6511720 minor allele is prevalent in about 10% of

the population and have established that the allele is protective, being associated with
lower levels of LDL-C [46].
Notwithstanding that, the frequency of recessive genes was low in this study population,
the prevalence of the homozygous genotypes for the minor alleles of LDLR, DSCAML1,
ABACA1, and APOA5 SNPs was higher in the

HIV+Dys+/- subjects compared to the HIV-Dys-

subjects. All but APOA5A SNPs did not record any significant genotypic prevalence. These
findings are consistent with previous reports by Wang et al., [19] and Aragones et al. [24]
who did not find any significant differences in their studies with respect to prevalence of
the DSCAML1 and ABCA1 genotypes between cases and control subjects. Our findings
demonstrated that the allelic frequencies were in equilibrium with the Hardy-Weinberg

nonetheless,

genotypic frequencies of ABCA1 and APOA5 polymorphisms were not consistent with
Hardy-Weinberg equation among the
polymorphisms among the

HIV+Dys-

HIV+Dys+ subjects, as well as

ABCA1 and DSCAML1

subjects. The low frequencies of the homozygotes of

the rare alleles of theses SNPS contributed to the observed deviations.
A longitudinal study conducted by Rotgar et al. [47] validated the contribution of 42 SNPs
to dyslipidemia among HIV-infected population treated with ART. The authors reported
that the degree of the contribution of SNPs and ART to dyslipidemia are similar and
therefore genetic information should be considered in addition to the dyslipidemic effect of
ART agents[47]. Results from the present study revealed that individuals with rs6511720
T/T genotype recorded increased levels of TC, TG, and LDL-C compared to non-carriers and
heterozygous combined rs6511720 GG/GT [Table 3]. Further multivariate logistic model
analysis showed a strong association of LDLR polymorphisms with high total cholesterol
holding all other confounding variables constants. A study by Lazzaretti et al. [15] reported
that

LDLR intron 19G>T (rs6511720) did not contribute to the plasma lipid levels in their

dataset, and hence may reflect a limited effect of this SNPs in HIV-infected patients. The
inconsistency could be due to different geographical settings and thereby calls for more
research in these SNPs among African descendants.
In this study, ABCA1 (rs2066714) G/G genotype was significantly associated a higher
probability of developing dyslipidemia. Furthermore, subjects with the homozygotes of the
rare alleles of ABCA1 have increased levels of TC compared to the common allele (AA/AG)
genotypes. As a further matter, subjects carrying the minor allelic variant of APOA5 were 2
times more likely to have low levels of HDL cholesterol among the HIV population in the
present study though no statistical significance was observed. These observations are in
congruent with previous reports demonstrated in literature demon ABCA1 is associated
with familial HDL deficiency.

We should mention here that low HDL-C was one of the

commonest lipid abnormalities observed in this study. Moreover, ABCA1 mediates the
efflux of cellular cholesterol and phospholipids unto ApoA-I and thereby plays a central
role in regulating cellular cholesterol homeostasis, and forming HDL[48, 49].

DSCAML1 (rs10892151) SNP in this study had increased levels of TC, TG, and LDL-c in T/T
genotype individuals compared with the other genotypes. Further analysis indicated that
individuals with the homozygous minor recessive gene (carriers) (T/T) were more likely
to have increased levels of TC and LDL-C. These observed findings are in parallel with
previous reports by Aragones et al. [24] who reported a strong association between the

null mutation have low circulating apolipoprotein (Apo) C-III levels and reduced fasting
and post-prandial triglyceride concentrations [23], which is likely due to the wellestablished function of Apo C-III as an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase[50].
This current study showed that carriers of the minor allelic variant of the

APOA5

(rs662799) A>G SNP gene, were 4 times more likely to developed dyslipidemia . Moreover,
individuals with homozygotes (G/G) have significantly increased levels of TC and LDL
cholesterol compared to wild type and heterozygote combined (AA/AG). Previous studies
have found rs662799 to be associated with elevated plasma triglyceride levels as well as
HDL-C and total cholesterol [21]. Two polymorphisms in the

APOA5 gene, ‚àí1131T>C and

S19W (56C>G), have already been shown to be associated with elevated triglyceride levels
in different populations[51, 52]. This study, however, considered the

APOA5 (rs662799)

A>G variant and found that HIV individuals with at least one G allele had higher TC and
LDL cholesterol levels.
Lazzaretti et al. [15] reported that

APOA5 ‚àí1131T>C

(rs662799) was associated with

plasma triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels (LDL-C) as well as
high-density-lipoprotein cholesterol levels. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the
first to investigate the

APOA5

(rs662799) A>G variant in HIV patients in a Ghanaian

population. Another study by Echeverria et al. [53] reported that polymorphisms in genes
associated with the development of atherogenic dyslipidemia, especially variants in the

APOA5

gene, can influence the circulating CD4 T-cell levels in chronically HIV-infected

patients. Although a previous study has reported the effect of APOA5 on CD4 levels ,
individuals with the minor allelic variant of

APOA5 (rs662799) A>G

have a significant

likelihood of developing dyslipidemia in HIV subjects on ART after controlling for CD4
counts as well as age, gender, duration of treatment and BMI .
This study has strength in it possibly being the first study to assess the prevalence of SNPs
and its association with dyslipidemia in the Ghanaian population as a proof of concept.
Although previous reports have shown an uneven continuous rate of the incidence of HIV
in the Ghanaian population with more than 60% of people living with HIV are females [54],
the proportion of female in the HIV study population was much higher than males which
could affect the generalizations of our findings to the HIV population in Ghana. In addition,
our study is limit by the fact that the number of investigated polymorphisms is not
comprehensive, notwithstanding, this is a baseline study for future exploratory analysis of
SNPs and its association with dyslipidemia among HIV patients on ART in Ghana.

This study has highlighted the evidence that SNPs in four candidate genes are present in
HIV patients exposed to ART in the Ghanaian population. Dyslipidemia remains prevalent
among HIV patients. SNPs were found to associate with dyslipidemia especially variants in
APOA5-rs662799

ABCA1-rs2066714

respectively.

This

finding

provides

baseline

information that necessitates a pre-symptomatic strategy for monitoring dyslipidemia in
ART-treated HIV patients Findings from this study should be validated in a longitudinal
case-control study considering the disease and its therapeutic implications. The candidate
SNP if validated will help in serving as potential biomarkers to detect individuals at risk for
dyslipidemia.
