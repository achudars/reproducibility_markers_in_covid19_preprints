Abstract

Background: HIV remains a major burden to the health care system and neuropathic pain is the most
common neurological complication of HIV-infection. Since current treatment strategies often lack
satisfying pain relief, cannabinoids are discussed as a new option. We investigated Cannabidivarin as
treatment for HIV-associated neuropathic pain.
Methods: We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. Patients
underwent two successive treatment phases (4 weeks each) and were treated with Cannabidivarin
(400mg/d) or placebo in a randomized order. A 3-week wash-out phase was designed to eliminate
potential carry-overeffects and patients were followed up for 3 weeks after the end of the second
treatment phase. The primary endpoint was pain intensity on an 11-point numeric rating scale and
was recorded in a diary. Secondary endpoints were additional pain medication, pain characteristics
and quality of life.
Results: We included 32 (31 male) patients. The mean pain intensity under Cannabidivarin was by
0.62 points higher compared to placebo (p=0.16; 95% CI -0.27 to 1.51). Cannabidivarin did not
influence the amount of additional pain medication, pain characteristics or quality of life. No
suspected unexpected adverse reactions occurred during the trial.
Discussion: Cannabidivarin was safe but failed to reduce neuropathic pain intensity in HIV-patients.
This may be explained by a lack of cannabinoid receptor activation, as indicated by preclinical
experiments. Further studies on larger sample sizes are needed.

Introduction

Approximately 7-8% of the general population suffer from neuropathic pain, defined as ´pain that
arises as a direct consequence of lesions or diseases affecting the somatosensory system´(1,2). Chronic
neuropathic pain impairs quality of life and negatively affects the patients’ social relationships (3).
Among various diseases that can underlie neuropathic pain, HIV-infection belongs to the most
prevalent (4) and despite the development of highly effective antiretroviral therapy, HIV remains a
major burden to the health system (5).
HIV-associated neuropathic pain usually occurs together with distal sensory neuropathy with
symptoms of burning or dysesthesia in combination with numbness in stocking- or glove-like
distribution (6), and may be caused by the inflammatory effects of HIV-infected macrophages and
other neurodegenerative mechanisms (6,7). Furthermore, antiretroviral drugs, mainly
dideoxynucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, can cause mitochondrial and nerve damage (7,8)
so that they are no longer recommended (9). Despite novel, more effective and less neurotoxic
antiretroviral drugs, the prevalence of neuropathic pain in HIV-infected patients is still high and causal
treatment is not available (6). Although treatment of chronic neuropathic pain should be based on
both pharmacological and interdisciplinary non-pharmacological approaches (e.g. behavioral, physical
and/or occupational therapy) (4), pharmacological therapy often predominates. Antidepressants,
anticonvulsants and opioid analgesics are medications of choice (10). However, they often lack efficacy
(4) and are limited by side effects such as respiratory depression, addiction and sedative effects (11),
resulting in extensive additional costs and reduced quality of life (3,12).
Endocannabinoids, e.g. 2-arachidonylglycerol and anandamide, influence the transmission of pain
signals by acting on cannabinoid (CB)-receptors 1 and 2 (13,14). Some exogenous cannabinoids have
shown promising results in the treatment of neuropathic pain but they were limited by complicated
dosing of smoked cannabis and side effects like nausea or drowsiness (15,16). Therefore, improved
cannabinoid and opioid analgesics are being developed (10,13,14,17).
In this study, we investigated Cannabidivarin (CBDV) a novel phytocannabinoid derived from the
Cannabis sativa L. plant, in patients with HIV-associated neuropathic pain. Using a double-blind crossover trial design, we assessed pain, side effects and quality of life, and sought to correlate treatment
responses to the patients’ genotype.

Results

Patient population

From January 2015 to September 2018 a total of 194 patients were contacted by email or phone, of
which 55 were screened in the study center. 34 patients were initially enrolled and assigned a patient
ID. The data of two patients could not be used for final efficacy analysis due to missing data or
screening failure but were included in the safety population (Figure 1). Characteristics of the remaining
32 patients are shown in Table 1. All patients met the inclusion criterion of a positive Douleur
Neuropathique 4 interview (DN4i) (≥3). Of the remaining 32 patients, 4 dropped-out during the study
but were not excluded from analysis. The data of 28 patients (27 male, 1 female) were used for full
efficacy analysis. Patients were randomized to receive CBDV in treatment phase A followed by placebo
in treatment phase B (C-P), or placebo in phase A followed by CBDV in phase B (P-C).

Primary endpoint

Overall, mean pain intensity (NRS; numeric rating scale) at the end of CBDV treatment was 0.62 points
higher compared to placebo; this difference was not significant (p=0.16; 95% CI -0.27 to 1.51) (Figure
2, Figure 3 and Table S 1) The mean NRS value at the end of follow-up (3 weeks after end of treatment
phase B) was 2.74 (SD: 1.47) in the C-P group and 3.67 (SD: 2.62) in the P-C group. During CBDV
treatment, 9 patients experienced a mean pain reduction of at least 20 % and were therefore classified
as CBDV responders. By the same criteria, 19 patients were classified as placebo responders.

Secondary endpoints

No statistical differences between CBDV and placebo were detectable by any of the questionnaires
analysing pain characteristics, sleep quality, subjective impression of change or quality of life (Table 2
and Figure 4). No significant changes in specific pain parameters in the painDETECT questionnaire
were detectable. Overall, the Medication Quantification Scale (MQS) values were not significantly
different between CBDV and placebo (median treatment effect of CBDV compared to placebo = 0,
p=0.52, 95% CI -0.05 to 2.85; non-parametric rank sum test) (Figure 5). After CBDV treatment, the
differences in MQS-values between baseline and end of treatment were +1.13 (SD=7.13) in the C-P
groupand -0.16 (SD=0.61) in the P-C group. After placebo treatment, these differences were +0.11
(SD=3.79) and -1.87 (SD=5.26) in the C-P group and P-C group, respectively.

Adverse events

31 patients (91.2%) experienced at least one adverse event (AE) during CBDV treatment, whereas 27
patients (79.4%) had at least one AE during placebo. During each treatment (CBDV or placebo), 9
patients (26.5 %) experienced an AE that was considered to be related to study medication (Table S 2).
One serious AE (acute myocardial infarction) was recorded during CBDV treatment but was judged as
not related to study medication. The most common AEs were diarrhea and dry mouth (3 cases during
each treatment). The incidence of AEs was similar in both treatment phases. All AEs were of low or
moderate severity and only one patient withdrew study participation due to an AE (cough) during
CBDV. Changes of laboratory values were considered to be not related to study medication and were
not clinically relevant.

Genetic analysis

Samples from the 28 patients who completed the entire study were genotyped using the Infinium
Global Screening array (GSA24, Illumina), and whole genome sequencing was performed on this subset
of patients. The small sample size did not allow a meaningful genome-wide association analysis of
response, but these data will have utility in future meta-analysis efforts, and can be queried for the
role of individual markers identified in other studies.

Discussion

In this study, CBDV failed to reduce neuropathic pain intensity in HIV-patients. Additionally, we could
not observe any statistically or clinically significant effects on use of supplementary pain medication,
specific pain characteristics or quality of life. CBDV and placebo produced similar rates of adverse
events which were of mild to moderate severity.
According to data on CB receptor knock-out mice and pharmacological studies, the mechanisms
underlying analgesic effects of cannabinoids are thought to be based on the activation of CB1 and/or
CB2 receptors, leading to an inhibition of pain signal transmission and/or anti-inflammatory effects
(14,18,19). This may either be achieved by exogenous cannabinoids or by inhibiting enzymes degrading
endocannabinoids (fatty acid amide hydrolase and monoacylglycerol lipase). Costa et al. also showed
that antinociception can be produced by a cannabinoid re-uptake inhibitor in rats (20). In addition,
effects of phytocannabinoids not primarily activating CB receptors have been described (21) .
CBDV is mainly known for its anticonvulsant effects (22,23). Limited unpublished preclinical data
indicated the occurrence of antinociceptive effects without binding to CB receptors (24).
Antinociceptive effects of cannabinoids not activating CB receptors were observed in previous animal
studies (25–28) but not in humans so far. Different mechanisms of action were hypothesized, such as
inhibition of Diacylglycerol Lipase-α (29), another enzyme influencing endocannabinoids. Some groups
observed an activation of transient receptor potentials (TRP) (29,30) and postulated that this activation
could lead to desensitization of sensory neurons (31).
To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of treatments, we assessed both pain intensity and the amount
of supplemental pain medication. A dose reduction of additional pain medication can minimize
detrimental side effects and can therefore be useful. CBDV however, did not significantly change pain
intensity or the use of additional pain medication as compared to placebo. We also examined whether
CBDV can influence pain characteristics such as burning sensation, numbness or heat hyperalgesia.
Due to the possible involvement of TRPV1 (29,30), a receptor which is responsible for heat sensation
(37), one might assume that CBDV can alleviate burning sensations in neuropathic pain patients. In the
painDETECT questionnaire however, CBDV did not influence any specific pain characteristics. To our
knowledge, this is the first study investigating the influence of CBDV on such parameters.
Overall, CBDV was ineffective in our trial. The most notable (but nonsignificant) pain relief was
observed in patients receiving placebo during the first phase (P-C). Since patients were randomized,
this was due to chance. It is conceivable that patients who were not treated sufficiently for pain before
entering our study benefitted from both treatments due to the enhanced attention in the setting of a
clinical trial.
Chronic pain negatively influences many other facets of the patient´s life according to the
biopsychosocial model of pain (3,32–35). Cannabinoids are known to influence emotional processes.
For example, the CB receptor agonist Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) may reduce the unpleasantness
but not the intensity of pain (36). However, CBDV failed to improve any of these features in the current
study.
CBDV does not bind to CB-receptors (38) and therefore should not show typical CB receptor-mediated
(27) psychotropic side effects such as euphoria, reduced anxiety or feeling ´high´ (40), consistent with
our findings. Since the most common side effects (diarrhea and dry mouth) did not differ between
CBDV and placebo, we do not consider these AEs related to CBDV treatment. However, they could be
associated with the sesame oil solution. We only observed side effects of low to moderate severity and
only one patient withdrew due to such effects. For a more reliable analysis, a larger number of patients
is needed.
Although we were able to obtain blood samples from most patients, this sample size was not sufficient
for a meaningful genome-wide association study regarding treatment responses. However, these data
are available upon request and will have utility in future meta-analysis efforts.
Due to recruitment difficulties, we could only enroll 16 patients per treatment sequence group instead
of a planned sample size of 21. A larger patient population would have increased the reliability of the

data. Nevertheless, we would not expect a marked change in the primary outcome since the present
results are far from statistical significance. Even the lower border of the 95% CI does not promise any
clinical relevance.
To conclude, this study showed that CBDV did not elicit more adverse side effects than placebo but
failed to alleviate neuropathic pain or any associated condition in HIV patients. We presume that
activation of CB receptors is necessary for significant analgesia. This was the first study investigating
CBDV for neuropathic pain and further research with larger numbers of patients is needed.

Methods

Study approval, funding and registration

Trial protocol, patient information and informed consent sheets were approved by the ethics
committee of the State regulatory authority Berlin (“LaGeSo”) and the German Federal Institute for
Drugs and Medical Devices (“BfArM”). All patients signed written informed consent. The CONSORT
guidelines, Good clinical practice (GCP) principles and the Declaration of Helsinki were strictly followed.
The study was funded by the European Union as part of the consortium ´NeuroPain—Neuropathic
pain: biomarkers and druggable targets within the endogenous analgesia system´ and was registered
in the EudraCT-register (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/) under number 2014-005344-17.

Study design

Data were collected from 1st January 2017 to 8th January 2019. We conducted a randomized, placebocontrolled, double-blind cross-over phase II trial in a single-center outpatient setting. All patients
received both treatments (CBDV and placebo) in two successive phases. The order of treatments
(CBDV-placebo [C-P] or placebo-CBDV [P-C]) was allocated by chance (randomized). Each patient was
monitored for 13 weeks. After the screening phase, baseline values on pain scales, questionnaires and
medication were recorded during a one-week phase (Figure 6). This was followed by a 4-week
treatment phase A with either placebo or CBDV, depending on the randomization. A subsequent 3week washout phase was included to eliminate potential carry-over effects. The duration of the washout phase was based on data showing an accumulation of cannabinoids in fatty tissue resulting in a
half-life of about 5 days after long-term oral administration (38,41). Thereafter, another 1-week
baseline phase ensued, followed by treatment phase B. Patients were then followed up for another 3
weeks. Throughout the study, the patients documented data in diaries.

Study participants

Participants were recruited through personal contacts to physicians and patient-advocacy groups in
the greater Berlin area, as well as by advertisement in the Berlin public transportation system. For
inclusion, subjects were screened for age (18-65 years), vital signs and pain intensity (≥ 4 on an 11point numeric rating scale). The diagnosis of HIV-associated sensory neuropathy was confirmed by a
clinician based on patient history, the DN4i and the Clinical HIV-associated Neuropathy Tool (CHANT).
Exclusion criteria were pregnancy and lactation, major psychiatric conditions, severe diseases of the
central nervous system, hepatic, renal or cardiovascular diseases or use of conventional cannabinoids,
examined by blood test. Electrocardiograms were recorded at day of screening and analysed for
abnormalities by an experienced cardiologist (AM). Infection with hepatitis virus B or C and AIDSdefining diseases were debarred by consulting HIV-specialists. The use of concomitant analgesics as
needed was permitted throughout the study. Standard laboratory values (full blood count, liver
function tests, electrolytes, glucose, urea, cholesterol, creatinine, creatinine kinase, protein and
international normalized ratio) were recorded at day of screening and during the trial.

Outcome measurements

The primary outcome was pain intensity measured thrice a day (8:30 AM, 1:00 PM and 7:00 PM) by an
11-point Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) (0 = no pain, 10 = worst pain imaginable), as documented in the
patient diary. For each day, the arithmetic mean of the three NRS scores was determined. A decrease
of mean NRS values by at least 20% between the last day of baseline measurement and the last day of
treatment was defined as a clinically relevant effect (responder). The number of responders and nonresponders to each treatment was determined. Secondary endpoints were pain characteristics, quality
of life and sleep, measured by questionnaires. We used painDETECT (42), the BPI (43) and the DN4i for
evaluation of pain intensity and pain characteristics (44), the HADS (45) to evaluate anxiety and
depression, and the SF-36 (46), the PGIC (47) and the ISI for quality of life and sleep (48), respectively.
All questionnaires were applied on the last day of each baseline phase and on the last day of each
treatment phase, except PGIC, which was only used at the end of each treatment phase. Concomitant
medication and side effects were recorded in the patient diary. For the analysis of concomitant pain
medication we used the MQS in its 3rd version, which assigns a score (on an unlimited scale) based on
the detrimental effects and dose of each pain medication (49). For analysis of side effects, patients
were asked to document any adverse or unusual events. These were discussed with a study physician
at each visit. For standardized documentation, we used paper-based tables and classified the events
with the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), Version 4.03.

Randomization, allocation concealment and blinding

Randomization to the sequence of treatments occurred in blocks of four by use of paper-based,
computer-generated random lists, which were stored in a locked cabinet. Patients included were
pseudonymised by generating a serial number. Allocation to the treatment sequence was documented
and kept in sealed envelopes. All patients and staff involved in patient contacts and assessment of
outcomes were blinded until the end of the study.

Monitoring

Two independent monitors conducted unblinded monitoring of patient safety and adherence to GCP
principles throughout the trial.

Investigational Medicinal Products (IMP)

The active agent and placebo, both dissolved in sesame oil, were identically appearing and tasting
solutions. The IMP was packaged in amber-glass bottles by GW Pharmaceuticals. All bottles were
subject-specific and marked with the patient-ID. The bottles with active agent contained 50 mg
CBDV/ml. Patients were instructed to use 8 ml of the solution orally every morning at 9 AM,
corresponding to 400 mg CBDV in the verum treatment phase (Table 3). The dose was chosen based
on non-published preclinical and clinical phase-1-studies, carried out by GW Pharmaceuticals (38).

Inactivation of HIV in blood samples, DNA isolation and Genetic analysis

Blood samples were obtained during the last visit from the 28 patients who gave consent for genetic
analysis. 5 ml of peripheral venous blood was mixed with 15 ml of Red Cell Lysis Solution (Epicentre R)
and incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. After centrifugation, supernatant was discarded,
and the pellet was dissolved in 7.5 ml Tissue and Cell Lysis Solution (Epicentre R). The solution was kept
at 65oC for one hour for inactivation of HIV and cell lysis. Samples were then stored and transported
at -20oC until genotyping by deCODE Genetics (Reykjavik, Iceland). Whole genome sequencing was
performed by the Infinium Global Screening array (GSA24, Illumina).

Statistical analysis

Sample size was calculated by nQuery Advisor® 7.0 based on the primary endpoint (NRS scale) and the
cross-over study-design. According to previous literature, a pain reduction by 20% upon verum
compared to placebo and a common standard deviation for the period differences of 2.5 seemed to
be achievable and would have been clinical meaningful (50–52). We calculated that 21 patients per
sequence group were sufficient to show this effect (e.g. a reduction of 20% from 6 points to 4.8 points)
with a power of 85% and a two-sided type-I-error of 0.05 using a paired t-test for 2x2 crossover designs.
To account for an estimated 15% dropouts, we aimed at a total of 50 patients.
Statistical analysis was based on the intent-to-treat principle. Every patient who started treatment and
had at least one post-baseline measurement of the primary endpoint was included in the efficacy
analysis. Continuous variables are shown as mean, standard deviation and range, while categorical
parameters are given as absolute and relative frequency. For the continuous endpoints, first, the
difference between sequence-specific baseline and the value after treatment was calculated. Then, for
each individual the difference between the two treatment effects (CBDV - placebo) was determined.
A paired t-test taking period effects into account was used for comparing the two treatments. In case
of non-normality of data distribution, a non-parametric version was applied instead. 95%-confidence
intervals (CI) were calculated for the treatment effects. All p values resulting from the analyses have
