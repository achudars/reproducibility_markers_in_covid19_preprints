Abstract

30

Objective: To detect potential hotspots of transmission of dengue and chikungunya in Barbados,

31

and assess impact of input surveillance data and methodology on observed patterns of risk.

32

Methods: Using two methods of cluster detection, Moran’s I and spatial scan statistics, we

33

analyzed the geospatial and temporal distribution of disease cases and rates across Barbados for

34

dengue fever in 2013–2016, and a 2014 chikungunya outbreak.

35

Results: During years with high numbers of dengue cases, hotspots for cases were found with

36

Moran’s I in south and central regions in 2013 and 2016, respectively. Using smoothed disease

37

rates, clustering was detected every year for dengue. Hotspots were not detected via spatial scan

38

statistics, but coldspots suggesting lower rates of disease activity were found in southwestern

39

Barbados during high case years of dengue.

40

Conclusions: Spatial analysis of surveillance data is useful in identifying outbreak hotspots,

41

complementing existing early warning systems. We caution that these methods should be used in

42

a manner appropriate to available data, and reflecting explicit public health goals – managing for

43

overall case numbers, or targeting anomalous rates for further investigation.

Introduction
Dengue fever threatens the health of communities throughout Latin America and the

47

Caribbean, where all four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV 1–4) are in circulation following a

48

regional resurgence of the pathogen in the 1980s 1,2. The Caribbean island of Barbados is

49

challenged with managing endemic dengue fever, and other febrile mosquito-borne diseases

50

including emerging chikungunya and Zika viral diseases 3,4. In small island nations like

51

Barbados, outbreaks translate into increased morbidity and mortality, high costs to healthcare

52

systems, and lost economic productivity 5–7. With approximately 40% of employment and gross

53

domestic product linked to the tourism industry, Barbados is particularly vulnerable to the

54

economic impacts of arbovirus outbreaks 8. In addition to lost domestic productivity, travel-

55

related cases and negative health perceptions associated with outbreaks deter potential visitors,

56

further impacting the livelihoods of island residents 9,10. The emergence and subsequent

57

establishment of novel arboviruses in the Caribbean exacerbates matters by complicating disease

58

management while further impacting sources of income 3. In response to these social and

59

economic burdens, the Ministry of Health and Wellness of Barbados (MoH) has a long history of

60

engaging in public mosquito control and active disease surveillance, where suspected human

61

cases are laboratory confirmed, and vector control interventions are conducted in response to

62

both lab results and mosquito surveillance. Interagency collaborations are part of a

63

comprehensive effort to mitigate the toll of endemic dengue11. Previous studies performed in

64

Barbados have described climatological and seasonal drivers of dengue transmission, vital

65

components of early warning systems and forecasting models 12. While large-scale

66

climatological factors undoubtedly play a dominant role in driving outbreaks of mosquito-borne

67

illness, this plays out at the local scale as a function of the human landscape 13,14. Therefore

68

understanding the local distribution of human cases is also necessary for understanding patterns

69

of exposure risk and guiding vector abatement strategies.

70

Aedes aegypti is the primary mosquito vector of medical concern throughout the

71

Caribbean. Public health vector control programs are widely acknowledged as cost effective in

72

controlling arboviruses transmitted by Ae. aegypti, relative to costs associated with the delivery

73

of health services and supportive care 15. Nevertheless, public health resources are finite, calling

74

for efficient intervention strategies to target mosquito populations and suppress transmission

75

pathways. Aedes aegypti is a container-breeding mosquito, and successfully exploits

76

anthropogenic environments for oviposition and larval rearing. The role of household-level

77

characteristics, such as housing condition and water storage habits, in promoting mosquito

78

production has been repeatedly demonstrated13,14. In some instances, favorable microhabitats

79

enable mosquitoes, and subsequently disease transmission, to persist in spite of generally

80

unfavorable environmental conditions 16. Thus, identifying spatial clusters of high disease

81

activity, or “hotspots,” can prove invaluable when prioritizing the delivery of abatement and

82

outreach services. Further additional challenges, while not unique in the context of integrated

83

vector control, are essential to address for management of mosquito-borne diseases in Caribbean

84

islands. Vector-borne disease risk can shift rapidly on small island like Barbados due to many

85

factors including insecticide resistance, climate variability, climate change, high disease

86

prevalence, and variable mosquito control efforts in response to herd immunity dynamics. Small

87

island developing states in the Caribbean also face challenges to the elimination of Ae. aegypti,

88

as reintroductions of pathogens and vectors are frequent due to inter-regional travel, unplanned

89

urbanization, and limited resources for vector control 17. These management challenges demand

90

strategies that incorporate spatially and temporally sensitive methods of detecting transmission

91

activity.

92

Geographic information systems (GIS) offer a powerful tool in the visualization and

93

incorporation of spatial epidemiological data into public health programs 18. While many health

94

departments and ministries have readily adopted GIS methods into their surveillance and

95

reporting activities, fewer have extended these methodologies to incorporate statistical tests of

96

spatial dependency in human case data. Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) statistics

97

are routinely used in an exploratory framework to quantitatively describe patterns of spatial

98

dependence and clustering, or dispersion, of disease cases within a defined area of study 19.

99

Identifying spatially discrete areas of significantly high (i.e. hotspots), or low (i.e. coldspots),

100

disease activity within functional administrative boundaries is a useful framework for crafting

101

responses to outbreak events and future interventions, enabling agencies to focus their efforts

102

more efficiently. Global and local Moran’s I tests have been applied in public health contexts to

103

describe spatial distributions of mosquito-borne disease outbreaks, including dengue fever, and

104

to detect the location of disease clusters 14,20,21.

105

While LISA methods give us insight into the spatial structure of disease activity within a

106

given time period, these analyses are temporally static. In instances where georeferenced disease

107

surveillance data are available at regular time intervals, spatial scan statistics can be employed to

108

identify local areas of clustering in multiple dimensions (i.e. space, time, or space-time). Spatial

109

scan statistics are capable of detecting possible disease clustering in case-only surveillance data,

110

using a series of variable search windows to evaluate spatial and temporal trends in the dataset

111

22,23

. Application of space-time scan statistics can be a powerful tool in disease surveillance and

112

outbreak detection, where we are interested in describing not only where, but also when clusters

113

of events occur over a continuous period of time.

114

To our knowledge, no previous efforts have described the spatial and temporal

115

distribution of dengue or chikungunya outbreaks in Barbados. Using epidemiological case data

116

collected by the MoH in Barbados from 2013 – 2016, we used exploratory LISA and space-time

117

scan statistics to test for spatial and temporal autocorrelation of dengue and chikungunya cases

118

within operational health districts. The objectives of this study were to i) detect global spatial

119

dependency, or clustering, of surveillance arbovirus cases reported in Barbados within each year

120

of the study period; ii) when global spatial dependency is detected, identify the locations of

121

hotspots (i.e. clustered) and coldspots (i.e. dispersed) of disease activity; iii) assess the effect of

122

different input data on observed spatial patterns; and iv) detect spatiotemporal patterns in disease

123

rates at finer temporal resolutions via spatial scan statistics. This also provides an important

124

opportunity to discuss and showcase the implications of how these methods are implemented in

125

situations where data are limited, simply as a function of small populations, as seen in small

126

island nations.

Methods

128

Study Area and Epidemiological Data – Barbados, situated in the Caribbean, has an

129

estimated residential population of over 277,000 24. The most densely populated areas are found

130

on the southern side of the island, with the highest population density found around Bridgetown,

131

the capital city 24. Transmission of mosquito-borne diseases in Barbados is seasonal, with peak

132

transmission typically associated with high numbers of mosquitoes during the rainy season (June

133

–November), and fewer disease cases reported during the dry season (December–May) 12,25. The

134

MoH of Barbados performs active and passive surveillance for dengue and other mosquito-borne

diseases via nine polyclinics. These serve seven polyclinic administrative catchment (PAC) areas

136

(Branford Taitt, David Thompson, Eunice Gibson, Maurice Byer, Randall Philip, St. Philip, and

147

confirmed in the National Reference Laboratory by RT-PCR or ELISA. De-identified, monthly

148

case totals for dengue fever in each health district were provided by the MoH for the years 2013

149

– 2016, and we defined the location of cases as the centroid of a given district. Georeferenced

150

data on lab-confirmed chikungunya cases, aggregated to health districts, were also made

151

available for this study, but were only available for the 2014 outbreak. Additional GIS data were

152

provided for this study by the MoH, including shapefiles of the administrative boundaries for

153

health districts in Barbados.

154

Global and Local Indicators of Spatial Association – Annual case totals for dengue and

155

chikungunya in each health district were aggregated from monthly case data provided by the

156

MoH for each year of the study. Annual per capita disease rates were derived from annual totals

157

and population data from the most recent national census, conducted in 2010 24. The population

158

of each health district ranged from 68 to 12,743, according to census data. Due to low population

159

in some health districts, raw disease rates may be susceptible to instability due to high variance

160

associated with small numerators or denominators (i.e. the “small number problem”) 26.

161

Performing spatial analyses on raw rates with high instability can result in incorrectly identifying

162

artefacts of the small number problem as statistically significant outliers. We performed

163

Empirical Bayes smoothing (EB), where the variance of rate estimates is globally reduced via a

164

priori probability functions, on raw disease rates in Geoda (ver. 1.12.0) to compensate for high

165

variability in rates due to low health district population. EB smoothed rates were compared to

166

raw disease rates, verifying the overall reduction of variance from smoothing.

167

Global Moran’s I with inverse distance weighting (ArcMap, ver. 10.4) was used to test

168

for spatial autocorrelation in both case counts and smoothed disease rates for dengue and

169

chikungunya in Barbados for each year of the study. A global indicator of spatial dependence,

170

the Moran’s I statistic provides a measure of the degree of statistically significant clustering or

171

dispersion in disease measures for the entire island. Local Moran’s I is a LISA statistic for

172

identifying locations (e.g. health districts within the study area) with statistically similar spatial

173

patterns (e.g. clustering or dispersion) of high and low values (i.e. hotspots or coldspots) on the

174

island 27. This statistic is also useful for the detection of spatial outliers, locations with

175

significantly extreme values compared to neighboring areas 27. Local Moran’s I with inverse

176

distance weighting was performed for each reported year in ArcMap (ver. 10.4) to identify health

177

districts that were hotspots, or coldspots, of dengue or chikungunya activity.

178

Spatial Scan Statistics – We compared the spatial distribution of dengue and chikungunya

179

found via LISA statistical analyses, calculated for each year of the study, to patterns of clustering

180

and dispersion in continuous aggregated cases over the study period. Patterns of spatiotemporal

181

clustering in monthly case totals within each year were tested using the univariate Kuldorrff

182

space-time scan statistics in SaTScan (ver. 9.4.4), where we performed retrospective space-time

183

analyses, scanning for both clustering and dispersion 28. A circular search window was specified

184

to test for spatiotemporal clustering, comparing cases at each location (i.e. centroids of health

185

districts) to neighboring areas within a variable window, using a time precision of one month.

186

Clusters were constrained to a maximum cluster size of 50% of case data, a maximum temporal

187

window of 50% of the study period, and allowed for geographic overlap with other clusters,

188

provided that no neighboring cluster centers were included in a given cluster. Likelihood ratios

189

and associated p-values were reported for each identified cluster, where maximum likelihood

190

values were calculated via Monte Carlo simulation (999 replications). Statistically significant

191

clusters (α=0.05) from the SaTScan analyses were mapped with LISA results for each year in

192

ArcMap (ver. 10.4) for visual comparison.

Results
The number of dengue cases in Barbados reported by the MoH fluctuated greatly during

195

the study period, with large outbreaks occurring in 2013 (n=526) and 2016 (n=386), and lower

196

case numbers in 2014 (n=147) and 2015 (n=58). Georeferenced cases of chikungunya (n=57)

197

were only available for 2014. We detected statistically significant (α=0.05) global clustering (i.e.

198

Moran’s I values > 0) in aggregated case counts during the years of large dengue outbreaks, 2013

199

and 2016 (Table 1), while significant global clustering of EB smoothed rates was found in every

200

year for dengue (Table 2). No significant clustering was detected during the 2014 chikungunya

201

outbreak.

233

districts. Statistically significant spatial autocorrelation was only detected in smoothed rates in

234

years of lower dengue burden (i.e. 2014 and 2015). During low burden years, hotspots were

235

generally identified in northern health districts, while coldspots were detected in southern health

236

districts (Fig. 3).

237

In years with large outbreaks of dengue, health districts in the southernmost Randall

238

Philip PAC area were identified as hotspots of cases in 2013 (n=4), and in the centrally located

239

St. Philip PAC area in 2016 (n=1) (Fig. 2). Coldspots for dengue cases were detected in health

240

districts located in the Maurice Byer (n=5), Branford Taitt (n=4), and Eunice Gibson (n=2) PAC

241

areas in 2013. In 2016, only 3 districts, in the Branford Taitt (n=2) and Winston Scott (n=1)

242

administrative regions, were significant coldspots of cases (Fig. 2). Three health districts, located

243

in Branford Taitt, Eunice Gibson, and David Thompson catchment areas, were found to be

244

clustered outliers in both 2013 and 2016 (Fig. 2). When performing LISA analyses on smoothed

245

dengue rates, the northern Maurice Byer PAC area contained all health districts that were

246

hotspots of disease rates in 2013 (n=4) and 2016 (n=4) (Fig. 3). Significantly low rates of dengue

247

were consistently found in southern health districts throughout the study period (Fig. 3).

248

Analysis of monthly case data in Barbados via spatial scan statistics did not identify

249

statistically significant hotspots for either dengue or chikungunya. However, spatiotemporal

250

coldspots of dengue cases were found in years with high case counts, indicating the duration and

251

location of low disease activity during outbreak years (Table 3). In 2013, a coldspot spanning

252

nine health districts across three PAC areas persisted from January to March (Table 3, Fig. 2). A

253

Discussion

260

In this study, we found that cases of dengue fever in Barbados detected via surveillance

261

in 2013–2016 exhibit both spatial and temporal structure. Dengue cases showed significant

262

clustering in the central and southwestern health districts only in years with elevated case counts.

263

In constrast, smoothed rates of population-derived incidence revealed clustering in all years for

264

dengue, with many hotspots found in northern health districts. The identification of spatial

265

dependence in disease cases is highly relevant for public health professionals working to

266

suppress arbovirus transmission in Barbados, where there is a call to allocate public health

267

resources efficiently.

268
269

Spatial discrepancies in data inputs (i.e. case numbers vs. population-derived rates) were
driven in part by the small and spatially heterogeneous population density of Barbados.

270

Consequently, any analyses performed on this system are susecptible to the “small numbers

271

problem,” where estimates of commonly reported epidemiological metrics such as disease

272

prevalence and incidence rates can dramatically fluctuate as an artefact of either low density of

273

underlying populations, or relatively low case detection in high density populations 26.

274

Procedures to reduce variance in rates, such as EB smoothing, are recommended to reduce the

275

effect of unstable rates in disease mapping and tests for spatial autocorrelation 29. However,

276

broad geospatial prescriptive remedies for the small numbers problem may unintentionally

277

subvert public health agency management priorities, particularly in small island systems with

278

extreme spatial population heterogeneity. Even after smoothing, we observed consistent hotspots

279

of disease activity in northern health districts, where population densities are very low. Health

280

districts with significantly high disease rates in low populations may not represent pragmatic

281

management targets, especially in years where resources are limited or outbreaks are focused in

282

urban centers. Although statistically sound, practical application of such analyses should be

283

tempered by the expectations and priorities of public health agencies. In this context, raw case

284

counts may give us a better understanding of operational disease burden on Barbados despite the

285

problems typically associated with disregarding underlying population in morbidity metrics,

286

where we would expect to detect more cases in densely populated areas regardless of true risk.

287

The differences observed in the spatial distribution of cases versus rates have critical

288

implications with regards to intervention strategies and management goals. Although we

289

accounted for inflated variance in rates by performing EB smoothing, hotspots in northern

290

districts still reflect lower absolute case loads than found in densely populated areas in the south,

291

especially in the vicinity of Bridgetown, the capital city. It is therefore imperative that

292

management objectives are clearly specified before using spatial analyses on health surveillance

293

data for planning purposes. Prioritization of goals is particularly important in a small island with

294

high heterogeneity in population density, where making management decisions based on

295

unstable rates could drive misallocation of resources. When responding to endemic transmission

296

or emerging pathogens, like chikungunya, targeting areas with the highest transmission rates (i.e.

297

high numbers of cases relative to the underlying population) should be prioritized to prevent

298

further spread. Conversely, when considering large outbreaks of endemic diseases, like dengue,

299

the management focus may be instead on reducing the total number of infections, regardless of

300

population density, to mitigate hyperendemic peak years and reduce costs associated with the

301

delivery of health services. In Barbados, these fundamental management distinctions may be

302

subtle, but as our analyses demonstrate, can require vastly different spatial representations of

303

disease clustering in the study area. This would directly translate to choices of where to allocate

304

resources in particular health districts.

305

While we observed shifts in the clustering and dispersion of disease activity in Barbados

306

between years, there were nevertheless consistencies in the location of health districts with

307

clustered dengue cases or rates, especially in outbreak years. In particular, health districts

308

identified as high clustering outliers during peak years were identical in 2013 and 2016,

309

suggesting that some areas may have an underlying susceptibility to localized outbreaks when

310

transmission is high (Fig. 2). Although the analyses presented here represent a reactive

311

management approach, in which there is lagged decision-making in response to previously

312

reported case data, spatial methodologies can also be incorporated into proactive strategies as

313

part of an early warning system framework. Predictive climatological models of dengue risk

314

have been developed for Barbados, enabling the anticipation of large outbreak events driven by

315

environmental factors 12. Although useful in terms of triggering agency response ahead of major

316

island wide outbreak events, current probabilistic forecast models do not provide information on

317

where to intervene. Here, our spatial analyses point to consistent areas of transmission peaks,

318

providing complementary analyses to predictive climate modeling efforts, which can be

319

incorporated into MoH decision making, targeting discrete locations for mosquito control ahead

320

of anticipated outbreak events.

321

We did not identify significant spatiotemporal clustering of dengue or chikungunya with

322

spatial scan statistics within the study period, although coldspots of low dengue activity were

323

found in years with higher case totals. Previous studies have indicated that spatial scan statistics

324

are often more sensitive to the detection of hotspots, particularly when relative risk is low,

325

compared to other exploratory methods of spatial analysis 30,31. Spatial scan statistics have also

326

been used to successfully identify hotspots of mosquito-borne diseases at fine temporal

327

resolutions in systems where diseases are endemic 32,33. Our inability to detect disease clustering

328

at higher temporal resolutions, even in years with high case counts, perhaps points to a lack of

329

within season localized clustering. The coldspots detected in 2016 for dengue coincide with the

330

rainy season in Barbados, when we would expect to see increased transmission (Table 3).

331

Coldspots arise as a result of spatial uniformity in risk outside these areas of unexpectedly low

332

transmission. Our ability to detect spatial clustering at subseason scales may alternatively be

333

hindered by human movements, reflecting the difficulty of performing local disease surveillance

334

in transient populations (e.g. commuters and international travelers) 34. Although the inability to

335

detect monthly clustering of arbovirus cases may limit the utility of spatial scan statistics to

336

direct mosquito control activities at fine temporal scales in Barbados, our identification of

337

coldspots during active transmission seasons warrants investigation and future research into

338

potential drivers.

339

Aggregated surveillance data are routinely collected in a public health context, but are not

340

free from limitations. The MoH verifies dengue and chikungunya cases in the laboratory, but

341

underreporting of cases is a commonly encountered issue with passive surveillance data in Latin

342

America and the Caribbean, resulting in an underestimation of true disease risk in some areas 35.

343

The availability of current population data for calculating disease rates is also a limitation of this

344

work. Although the projected population growth for Barbados is quite low, the most recent

345

census data were collected in 2010, nearly a decade ago 24. In a spatial analysis context,

346

aggregation of cases to health districts prevents us from drawing conclusions at finer scales.

347

Although this limits our ability to inform household-level interventions within disease clusters,

348

identifying health districts with high level of disease transmission is nevertheless relevant to the

349

operational scale of health services delivered by the MoH in Barbados. Despite these limitations,

350

the data used in this study represent the most accurate, and up-to-date estimates of population

351

and disease risk in Barbados.

352

Public Health Implications

353

These initial results serve as the foundation for incorporating spatial analyses into the

354

existing arbovirus surveillance network in Barbados. Moving forward, these methodologies

355

provide us not only with a means of guiding ministry responses to outbreaks of mosquito-borne

356

diseases, but also the impetus for future geospatial analytical health studies in Barbados.

357

Exploratory spatial analyses allow us to test hypotheses related to dominant social-ecological

358

drivers of spatial clustering in health districts. Understanding the human characteristics that

359

underlie observed spatial patterns can contribute to the development of better intervention

360

methods.
