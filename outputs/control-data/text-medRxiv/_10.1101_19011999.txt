Abstract

62

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with a substantially

63

increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). High plasma viral load, low CD4+ T cell

64

counts and absence of antiretroviral treatment (ART) are known predictive factors for

65

NHL. Even in the era of suppressive ART, HIV-infected individuals remain at increased

66

risk of developing NHL compared to the general population. To search for human genetic

67

determinants of HIV-associated NHL, we performed case-control genome-wide

68

association studies (GWAS) in three cohorts of HIV+ patients of European ancestry and

69

meta-analyzed the results. In total, 278 cases and 1924 matched controls were included.

70

We observed a significant association with NHL susceptibility in the C-X-C motif

71

chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL12) region on chromosome 10. A fine mapping analysis

72

identified rs7919208 as the most likely causal variant (P = 4.77e-11). The G>A

73

polymorphism creates a new transcription factor binding site for BATF and JUND.

74

Analyses of topologically associating domains and promoter capture Hi-C data revealed

75

significant interactions between the rs7919208 region and the promoter of CXCL12, also

76

known as stromal-derived factor 1 (SDF-1). These results suggest a modulatory role of

77

CXCL12 regulation in the increased susceptibility to NHL observed in the HIV-infected

78

population.

Introduction

84

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection is associated with a markedly increased

85

risk of several types of cancer compared to the general population.1–3 This elevated cancer

86

risk can be attributed partly to viral-induced immunodeficiency, frequent co-infections

87

with oncogenic viruses (e.g., Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses,

88

human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) and papillomavirus), and increased prevalence of traditional

89

risk factors such as smoking.4,5 However, all of these risk factors may not entirely explain

90

the excess cancer burden seen in the HIV+ population.6

91

A previous study performed in the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS) identified two AIDS-

92

defining cancers, Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) as the main types

93

of cancer found among HIV positive patients (NHL representing 34% of all identified

94

cancers).4 The relative risk of developing NHL in HIV patients was highly elevated

95

compared to the general population (period-standardized incidence ratio (SIR) = 76.4).4

96

High HIV plasma viral load, absence of antiretroviral therapy (ART) as well as low CD4+

97

T cell counts are known predictive factors for NHL.7,8 The introduction of ART into

98

clinical practice has led to improved overall survival and restoration of immunity by

99

decreasing viral load and increasing CD4+ T cell counts, and has led to a decreased risk of

100

developing NHL. However, the risk remains substantially elevated compared to the general

101

population (SIR = 9.1 (8.3–10.1))9 and NHL still represents 20% of all cancers in people

102

living with HIV in the ART era.10 Non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas associated with HIV are

103

predominantly aggressive B-cell lymphomas. Although they are heterogeneous, they share

104

several pathogenic mechanisms involving chronic antigen stimulation, impaired immune

response, cytokine deregulation and reactivation of the oncogenic viruses EBV and HHV-

106

107

The emergence of genome-wide approaches in human genomics has led to the discovery

108

of many associations between common genetic polymorphisms and susceptibility to

109

several diseases including HIV infection and multiple types of cancer.12,13 Recent genome-

110

wide association studies (GWAS) of NHL have identified multiple susceptibility loci in

111

the European population.14–22 These variants are located in the genes LPXN21, BTNL223,

112

EXOC2, NCOA114, PVT114,22, CXCR5, ETS1, LPP, and BCL222 for various subtypes of

113

NHL, as well as BCL6 in the Chinese population.24 Strong associations with variation in

114

human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes have also been reported.15,18,22 However, in the

115

setting of HIV infection, no genome-wide analysis has been reported concerning the

116

occurrence of NHL and the specific mechanisms driving their development remain largely

117

unknown.

118

Here we report the results of the first genome-wide analysis of NHL susceptibility in

119

individuals chronically infected with HIV. We combined three HIV cohort studies from

120

France, Switzerland and the USA and searched for associations between >6 million single

121

nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and a diagnosis of NHL. We identified a novel genetic

122

locus near CXCL12 as associated with the development of NHL among HIV+ individuals.

Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS)

136

The SHCS is a large, ongoing, multicenter cohort study of HIV-positive individuals that

137

includes >70% of adult living with HIV in Switzerland. At follow-up visits every 6 months,

138

demographic, clinical, laboratory, and ART information has been prospectively recorded

139

since 1988.25 Cancer diagnoses are verified thoroughly using checking charts including

140

information on biopsies and imaging. To minimize potential treatment bias and population

141

stratification, we only considered as cases patients diagnosed with NHL between 2000 and

142

2017 and of European ancestry, as determined by principal component analysis (PCA)

143

(supplemental Figure 1A). Controls were matched based on age, ancestry, CD4+ T cell

144

counts and viral load results. To be eligible as controls, they also had to be diagnosed with

145

HIV prior to 2005 and have no registered cancer diagnosis of any type as of 2017. Patients

French Primo ANRS and ANRS CO16 Lymphovir cohorts (ANRS)

151

The French ANRS CO16 lymphovir cohort of HIV related lymphomas enrolled adult

152

patients at diagnosis of lymphoma in 32 centers between 2008 and 2015.26 Pathological

153

materials were centralized, and diagnoses of NHL were based on World Health

154

Organization criteria. Patients were genotyped using Illumina Human Omni5 Exome 4v

155

beadchips. Additional cases and controls were included from the ANRS PRIMO Cohort,

156

which has been enrolling patients during primary HIV-1 infection in 95 French Hospitals

157

since 1996.27 Patients were genotyped using Illumina Sentrix Human Hap300 Beadchips.

158

Only patients of European ancestry, as determined by PCA, were included in the study

The MACS has enrolled gay and bisexual HIV infected men in 4 US cities since 1984. The

163

NHL cases were predominately diagnosed prior to the year 2000. Data collected include

164

demographic variables (age, race, ethnicity and HIV transmission category), CD4+ T cell

165

count, HIV viral load and tumor histology. Eligible cases had a diagnosis of HIV-related

166

NHL, available genotyping data and at least one CD4+ T cell count obtained within 2 years

170

HumanHap550 and Human1M Beadchips.28 As in the other cohorts, only individuals of

171

European ancestry were included, as determined by PCA (supplemental Figure 1C).

172
173

Quality control and imputation of genotyping data

174

The genotyping data from each cohort was filtered and imputed in a similar way, with each

175

genotyping array processed separately to minimize potential batch effects. All variants

176

were first flipped to the correct strand orientation with BCFTOOLS (v1.8) using the human

177

genome build GRCh37 as reference. Variants were removed if they had a larger than 20%

178

minor allele frequency (MAF) deviation from the 1000 genomes phase 3 EUR reference

179

panel or if they showed a larger than 10% MAF deviation between genotyping chips in the

180

same cohort.

181

The QC filtered genotypes were phased with EAGLE229 and missing genotypes were

182

imputed using PBWT30 with the Sanger Imputation Service31, taking the 1000 Genomes

183

Project Phase 3 panel as reference. Only high-quality variants with an imputation score

184

(INFO > 0.8) were retained for further analyses.

185
186

Genome-wide association testing and meta-analysis

187

To search for associations between human genomic variation and the development of HIV-

188

related NHL, we first performed separate GWAS within each cohort (SHCS, ANRS and

189

MACS) prior to combining the results in a meta-analysis.

190

For each cohort separately, the imputed variants were filtered out using PLINK

191

(v2.00a2LM)32 based on missingness (> 0.1), minor allele frequency (< 0.02) and deviation

192

from Hardy-Weinberg Equilibrium (PHWE < 1e-6). Determination of population structure

193

and calculation of principal components was done using EIGENSTRAT (v6.1.4)33 and the

194

HapMap3 reference panel34. All individuals not clustering with the European HapMap3

195

samples were excluded from further analyses. The samples were screened using KING

196

(v2.1.3)35 to ensure no duplicate or cryptic related samples were included. Single-marker

197

case-control association analyses were performed using linear mixed models, with genetic

198

relationship matrices calculated between pairs of individuals according to the leave-one-

199

chromosome-out principle, as implemented in GCTA mlma-loco (v1.91.4beta).36,37 Sex

200

was included as a covariate, except in the MACS cohort, which only includes men.

201

The results of the three GWAS were combined across cohorts using a weighted Z-score-

202

based meta-analysis in PLINK (v1.90b5.4), after exclusion of the variants that were not

203

present in all three cohorts.

204
205

Fine mapping of associated regions

206

Fine mapping of the CXCL12 locus was performed using PAINTOR (v3.1)38 to identify

207

the most likely causal variant(s). All variants within 200kb of the top associated SNP and

208

with a p-value below 0.005 were included in the model. The linkage disequilibrium (LD)

209

matrix was created using PLINK and genotype data from the SHCS cohort. PAINTOR was

210

first run against all genomic annotation databases provided with the software, including the

211

FANTOM5, ENCODE and the Roadmap Epigenomics Project. For the final model, the top

212

5 annotations based on improvement to model fit and cell type relevance were selected to

213

obtain the posterior probabilities and the 99% credible set of the variants most likely to be

214

causal based on the association from Bayes’ factors.

215
216

Predictive effect of potentially causal variants

217

The potential functional impact of the predicted causal variants was assessed using

218

DeepSEA39, a deep learning-based sequence model trained on available chromatin and

219

transcription factor data from ENCODE and Roadmap Epigenomics. DeepSEA provides a

220

functional significance score for each variant, which is a measure of the evolutionary

221

conservation and the significance of the magnitude of the predicted chromatin effects. For

222

the variants with a functional significance score of less than 0.01, we analyzed the predicted

223

changes in specific chromatin modifications or transcription factor (TF) binding

224

probabilities. Chromatin or TF binding changes with E-values below 0.001 and normalized

225

probabilities of observing a binding event above 0.2 were considered relevant. The TF

226

position weight matrices (PWMs) for TFs with a high probability of binding (normalized

227

probability ≥ 50%) were obtained from the JASPAR CORE 5.0 database.40

Comparison to GWAS hits in the general population

248

An attempt at replicating variants previously associated with NHL in the general

249

population was performed by extraction of the p-values of the SNPs reported to be

250

associated in previous NHL GWAS. A variant was considered replicated if it had a

Results

275

Study participants and association testing

276

To identify human genetic determinants of HIV-associated NHL, we performed case-

277

control genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in three groups of HIV+ patients of

278

European ancestry (SHCS, ANRS and MACS). The characteristics of the study participants

279

are presented in Table 1. In total, genotyping data were obtained for 278 cases

280

(NHL+/HIV+) and 1924 matched controls (NHL-/HIV+). With this sample size, we had

281

80% power to detect a common genetic variant (10% minor allele frequency) with a relative

282

risk of 2.5, assuming an additive genetic model and using Bonferroni correction for

283

multiple testing (Pthreshold = 5e-8).51

284

After genome-wide imputation and quality control, 6.2 million common variants were

285

tested for association with the development of NHL using linear mixed models including

286

sex as a covariate. Results were combined across cohorts using a weighted Z-score-based

287

meta-analysis (Figure 1A). The genomic inflation factor (lambda) was in all cases very

288

close to 1 [1.00–1.01], indicating an absence of systematic inflation of the association

289

results (Figure 1B; supplemental Figure 2).

Association results

292

We observed significant associations with the development of HIV-related NHL at a single

296

detected in the SHCS and ANRS cohorts and not among MACS study participants

(supplemental Table 1).

299

Fine mapping of the CXCL12 locus

300

To identify the causal variant(s) among associated SNPs and determine their potential

301

functional effects, we used a multi-level fine mapping approach, combining the statistical

302

fine mapping tool PAINTOR to obtain a 99% credible set and the deep learning framework

303

DeepSEA to predict any effects on chromatin marks and transcription factor binding these

304

variants may have.

305

Using PAINTOR, we identified a single variant, rs7919208, having a high posterior

306

probability (= 100%) of being causal among the 99% credible set based on the integration

307

of the association results, LD structure and enrichment of genomic features in this locus

308

(Figure 2).

309

Consistent with the PAINTOR result, DeepSEA also identified rs7919208 as the sole

310

variant, among the 99% credible set, predicted to have a functional impact by significantly

311

increasing the probability of binding by the B cell transcription factors BATF (log2 fold-

312

change = 3.27) and JUND (log2 fold-change = 2.91) (supplemental Table 2). Further

313

analysis of the genomic sequence surrounding rs7919208 and the JASPAR transcription

314

factor binding site (TFBS) motifs for BATF and JUND revealed that rs7919208 G->A

315

polymorphism creates the TFBS motif required for the binding of these transcription

316

factors (Figure 3A).

317

Long-range chromatin interactions

318

To assess the potential functional links between the TFBS created in the presence of the

319

minor allele of rs7919208 and the nearby genes, we performed an analysis of promoter

320

capture Hi-C data and topologically associating domains (TADs). We used the well-

321

characterized GM12878 lymphoblastoid cell line produced by EBV transformation of B

322

lymphocytes collected from a female European donor as model.

323

First, to examine the interaction potential of the rs7919208 region with nearby promoters,

324

we analyzed available promoter capture Hi-C data obtained from the GM12878 cell line.

325

This analysis revealed a significant interaction between the rs7919208 region and the

326

CXCL12 promoter, suggesting a possible modulating impact of rs7919208 on the

327

transcription of that gene (Figure 3B). Second, to further validate this observed genomic

328

interaction, we analyzed available TAD calls from GM12878 cells 41, using the 3D Genome

329

Browser for visualization42 (Figure 3C). We observed that rs7919208 is located within a

330

large TAD together with CXCL12, signifying the interaction potential of the new TFBS at

331

rs7919208 and CXCL12.

332
333

Transcriptomic effects of rs7919208

We did not observe any association between rs7919208 and mRNA expression levels of

335

CXCL12 in peripheral blood or PBMCs from multiple publicly available datasets,

336

including GTEx (v7)48, GEUVADIS

338

HIV infection causes many profound transcriptomic changes.52 Thus, in order to examine

339

the effect of rs7919208 on CXCL12 in the context of HIV infection, we extracted RNA

340

from PBMCs of 452 individuals in the SHCS with available genotyping data and sequenced

341

them using the Bulk RNA Barcoding and sequencing (BRB-seq) approach.49 However, the

342

expression levels of CXCL12 were below the limit of detection for most individuals,

343

preventing an eQTL analysis.

344
345

No replication of susceptibility loci found in the general population

346

To assess whether the genetic contribution to the risk of developing NHL is similar or

347

distinct in the HIV+ population compared to the general population, we extracted the p-

348

values of all variants found to be genome-wide significant in previous GWAS performed

349

in the general population14,21–24,53 and compared them to our results. We did not replicate

350

any of the previously published genome-wide associated variants, even at nominal

351

significance level (P < 0.05), despite sufficient statistical power for many of the variants,

352

thus indicating that the genetic susceptibility of NHL is distinct between the HIV+ and the

353

general population (supplemental Table 3). To further examine this possibility, we tested

354

whether the NHL/HIV+ associated variant rs7919208 is associated with an increased risk

355

of NHL in the general population. We performed a series of case/control GWAS of four

356

NHL subtypes (CLL, DLBCL, FL and MZL) as well as a combined GWAS with all NHL

357

subtypes (supplemental Table 4; supplemental Figure 4) and assessed the association

358

evidence at rs7919208. We found no association between rs7919208 and any of the

359

subtypes in the general population, even at nominal significance.

Discussion

361

In this genome-wide analysis, including a total of 278 NHL HIV+ cases and 1924 HIV+

362

controls from three independent cohorts, we identified a novel NHL susceptibility locus on

363

chromosome 10 near the CXCL12 gene. The strong signal observed in the meta-analysis

364

was driven by the associations detected in the SHCS and ANRS cohorts and there was no

365

evidence of association in the MACS cohort. Notably, most NHL cases in the MACS

366

cohort date back to the pre-ART era, while only NHL cases diagnosed after the year 2000

367

were included in the SHCS and ANRS analyses. Conceivably, NHL occurring in the early

368

years of the HIV pandemic may have been primarily driven by severe immunosuppression,

369

which could have obscured any influence of human genetic variation among the cases in

370

the MACS sample. Precise phenotype definition is crucial in designing large-scale genetic

371

studies since any environmental noise tends to decrease the likelihood of identifying

372

potential genetic influences.

373

NHL is a relatively rare cancer even among HIV infected individuals, making it difficult

374

to collect the large numbers of cases that would typically be included in contemporary

375

genome-wide genetic studies. Indeed, a recent study from the Data Collection on Adverse

376

events of Anti-HIV Drugs (D:A:D) group showed an NHL incidence rate of 1.17/1000

377

person-years of follow-up over the past 15 years (392 new cases in >40,000 HIV-infected

378

individuals).8 Still, we were able to obtain clinical and genetic data from a total of 278

379

patients with confirmed NHL diagnosis. By matching them with a larger number of

380

controls from the same cohorts, we had enough power to identify associated variants of

381

relatively large effects in the CXCL12 region.

382

Several groups have already suggested a potential role for CXCL12 variation in HIV-

383

related NHLs. A prospective study correlated increased CXCL12 expression with

384

subsequent NHL development in HIV-infected children but not in uninfected children.54

385

The number of A alleles at the CXCL12-3’ variant (rs1801157) has also previously been

386

associated with an increased risk of developing HIV-related NHL during an 11.7 year

387

follow-up period.55 Thus, our data further support the role of CXCL12 as a critical

388

modulator of the individual risk of developing NHL in the HIV population.

389

The role of CXCL12 and its receptor chemokine receptor 4 (CXCR4) in cancer in the

390

general population is well established, with the levels of CXCL12 and CXCR4 found to be

391

increased in multiple types of cancer and to be associated with tumor progression.56,57

392

Furthermore, in vivo inhibition of either CXCR4 or CXCL12 signaling is capable of

393

disrupting early lymphoma development in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)

394

mice transfused with EBV+ PBMCs.58 These results and others have already led to the

395

development and testing of several small molecules targeting either CXCL12 or CXCR4

396

to inhibit tumor progression.56

397

We could not identify any significant relationship between rs7919208 and the expression

398

levels of CXCL12 in PBMCs or EBV transformed lymphocytes. This can be due to multiple

399

factors such as the low expression levels of CXCL12 in most tissues, aside from stromal

400

cells, or that rs7919208 through creation of the BATF and JUND binding site represent an

401

induced or dynamic eQTL. These types of eQTLs are often found in regions deprived of

402

regulatory annotations, since these have been examined in static cell types.59 HIV-induced

403

overexpression of BATF60 could also explain why rs7919208 is only a risk factor in the

404

HIV population and not in the general population.

405

Previous analyses in the general population have discovered both shared and distinct

406

associations for NHL subtypes.14,21–24,53 However, similar analyses were not possible in

407

our sample since NHL subtype information was not available for many of our cases.

408

Furthermore, information on serostatus for relevant co-infections with EBV or other

409

oncogenic viruses was not available and could therefore not be assessed. In particular, EBV

410

has been largely associated with the development of NHL and other lymphomas and is

411

considered a driver of a subset of NHLs in the general population.61 Variants in the HLA

412

region have consistently been associated with all NHL subtypes in HIV uninfected

413

populations regardless of EBV serostatus. We did not find any evidence of HLA

414

associations in our analyses of HIV-related NHL. This lack of replication of HLA variants

415

and of all other previously identified risk variants from the general population suggests that

416

distinct genes or pathways influence susceptibility to NHL in the HIV+ population

417

compared to the general population.62

418

In summary, we have identified variants significantly associated with the development of

419

NHL in the HIV population. Fine mapping of the associated locus and subsequent analyses

420

of TADs, promoter capture Hi-C data as well as deep-learning models of mutational effects

421

on transcription factor binding, points to a causative model involving the gain of a BATF

422

and JUND transcription binding site downstream of CXCL12 capable of physically

423

interacting with the CXCL12 promoter. These results suggest an important modulating role

424

of CXCL12 in the development of HIV-related NHL.

Quantile-quantile plot of the observed -log10(p-value) (black dots, y-axis) versus expected
-log10(p-values) under the null hypothesis (red line) to check for any genomic inflation of
the observed p-values. No genomic inflation is observed, with the genomic inflation factor
lambda = 0.99. (C) Manhattan plot of all obtained p-values for each variant included in the
meta-analysis. The genome-wide threshold (P = 5e-8) for significance is marked by a
dotted line. Only variants at the CXCL12 locus were found to be significant.
