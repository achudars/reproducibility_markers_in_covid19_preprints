Abstract
During the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic, dengue and chikungunya – two other viral
diseases with the same vector as Zika – were also in circulation. Clinical presentation of
these diseases can vary from person to person in terms of symptoms and severity,
making it difficult to differentially diagnose them. Under these circumstances, it is
possible that numerous cases of Zika could have been misdiagnosed as dengue or
chikungunya, or vice versa. Given the importance of surveillance data for informing
epidemiological analyses, our aim was to quantify the potential extent of misdiagnosis
during this epidemic. Using basic principles of probability and empirical estimates of
diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, we generated revised estimates of Zika incidence
that accounted for the accuracy of diagnoses made on the basis of clinical presentation
with or without molecular confirmation. Applying this method to weekly incidence data
from 43 countries throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, we estimated that
1,062,821 (95% CrI: 1,014,428-1,104,794) Zika cases occurred during this epidemic,
which is 56.4% (95% CrI: 49.3-62.6%) more than the 679,743 cases diagnosed as Zika.
Our results imply that misdiagnosis was more common in countries with proportionally
higher incidence of dengue and chikungunya, such as Brazil.

Consistent and correct diagnosis is important for the veracity of clinical data used in
epidemiological analyses (1–3). Diagnostic accuracy can depend strongly though on the
uniqueness of a disease's symptomatology. On the one hand, diagnosis can be
straightforward when there are clearly differentiable symptoms, such as the hallmark
rash of varicella (4). On the other hand, with symptoms that are common to many
diseases, such as malaise, fever, and fatigue, it can be more difficult to ascertain a
disease's etiology (5–7). Further complicating clinical diagnosis is person-to-person
variability in apparent symptoms and their severity (8,9). In many cases, symptoms are
self-assessed by the patient and communicated verbally to the clinician, introducing
subjectivity and resulting in inconsistencies across different patients and clinicians
(10,11).
When they are used, molecular diagnostics are thought to greatly enhance the accuracy
of a diagnosis, as they involve less subjectivity and can confirm that a given pathogen is
present (12). Even so, molecular diagnostics do have limitations, particularly for
epidemiological surveillance. As molecular diagnostics are often not the standard
protocol, an infected person first has to present with symptoms in a medical setting and
the clinician has to decide to use a molecular diagnostic. This is particularly unlikely to
happen for emerging infectious diseases, as clinicians may not be aware of the
pathogen or that it is in circulation (13). In this context, molecular diagnostics may also
suffer from low sensitivity and specificity, high cost, or unavailability in settings with
limited resources (12,14). As a consequence of factors such as these, retrospective
analyses of the 2003 SARS outbreak in China identified SARS cases that were clinically
misdiagnosed as atypical pneumonia or influenza up to four months before the first
laboratory-diagnosed cases of SARS (15).
Challenges associated with disease diagnosis are magnified in scenarios with cocirculating pathogens, particularly when the diseases that those pathogens cause are
associated with similar symptoms (16,17). Influenza and other respiratory pathogens,
such as Streptococcus pneumoniae and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), co-circulate
during winter months in the Northern Hemisphere. The difficulty of correctly ascribing an
etiology in this setting is so widely accepted that clinical cases caused by a variety of
pathogens are often collated for surveillance purposes as “influenza-like illness” (18).
Similar issues occur in malaria-endemic regions (16,19). One study in India found that
only 5.7% of commonly diagnosed “malaria-infected” individuals actually had this
etiology, while 25% had dengue instead (16).
One set of pathogens with potential for misdiagnosis during co-circulation includes three
viruses transmitted by Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes: dengue virus
(DENV), chikungunya virus (CHIKV), and Zika virus (ZIKV). Some symptoms of the

diseases they cause can facilitate differential diagnosis, such as joint swelling and
muscle pain with CHIKV infection (20,21) and a unique rash with ZIKV infection (22,23).
Other symptoms, such as malaise and fever, could result from infection with any of
these viruses (20–25). In one region of Brazil with co-circulating DENV, CHIKV, and
ZIKV, Braga et al. (25) empirically estimated the accuracy of several clinical case
definitions of Zika by ground truthing clinical diagnoses against molecular diagnoses.
They found that misdiagnosis based on clinical symptoms was common, with
sensitivities (true-positive rate) and specificities (true-negative rate) as low as 0.286 and
0.014, respectively.
Although the estimates by Braga et al. (25) provide valuable information about
misdiagnosis at the level of an individual patient, they do not address how these
individual-level errors might have affected higher-level descriptions of Zika's
epidemiology during its 2015-2017 epidemic in the Americas. The Pan American Health
Organization (PAHO) reported 169,444 confirmed and 509,970 suspected cases of Zika
across 43 countries between September, 2015 and July, 2017 (26). Meanwhile, PAHO
reported 675,476 and 2,339,149 confirmed and suspected cases of dengue and
180,825 and 499,479 confirmed and suspected cases of chikungunya, respectively,
during the same timeframe in the same region (27,28). The substantial errors in clinical
diagnosis reported by Braga et al. (2017) (25), combined with the large number of cases
lacking a molecular diagnosis (26–28), leave open the possibility that a considerable
number of cases could have been misdiagnosed during the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic.
Our goal was to quantify the possible extent of misdiagnosis during the 2015-2017 Zika
epidemic by leveraging the full extent of passive surveillance data for dengue,
chikungunya, and Zika from 43 countries in the Americas in conjunction with empirical
estimates of sensitivity and specificity. Our methodology was flexible enough to use
either or both of suspected and confirmed cases, given that their availability varied and
they both offered information about the incidence of these diseases. To account for
variability in diagnostic accuracy, we made use of joint probability distributions of
sensitivity and specificity, one for clinical diagnostics and one for molecular diagnostics,
informed by empirical estimates. Using this approach, we updated estimates of Zika
incidence during its 2015-2017 epidemic across the Americas.
Methods
To quantify the degree of misdiagnosis during the Zika epidemic, we leveraged the full
extent of passive surveillance data on Zika, dengue, and chikungunya for 43 countries
in the Americas and formulated a Bayesian model of the passive surveillance
observational process. Our observation model was informed by the observed proportion
of Zika and empirically estimated misdiagnosis rates (Fig. 1). We used the model to

Data
We used suspected and confirmed case data for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika from
PAHO for 43 countries in the Americas. We differentiated between confirmed and
suspected cases on the basis of laboratory diagnosis versus clinical diagnosis (29). For
confirmed and suspected cases of chikungunya, we used manual extraction and text
parsing algorithms in perl to automatically extract data from epidemiological week (EW)
42 of 2013 through EW 51 of 2017 (28). For confirmed and suspected cases of Zika, we
used the skimage (30) and numpy (31) packages in Python 3.6 to automatically extract
incidence data from epidemic curves for each country from PAHO from EW 39 of 2015
to EW 32 of 2017 (26). For confirmed and suspected cases of dengue, we downloaded
weekly case data available from PAHO from EW 42 week of 2013 to EW 51 of 2017
(27). We restricted analyses to EW 42 of 2015 (the beginning of the fourth quarter of
2015) to EW 32 of 2017 (the last week with Zika data in our dataset) to focus our
analysis on the timeframe of the Zika epidemic (Fig. 2).

Probabilistic estimates of sensitivity and specificity
Due to variability in the sensitivity and specificity of different diagnostic criteria, we
treated 𝑠𝑒 and 𝑠𝑝 as jointly distributed random variables informed by empirical
estimates. To describe variability in misdiagnosis for molecular diagnostic criteria, we
included two empirical estimates of molecular sensitivity and specificity that were found
using ZIKV RT-PCR on a panel of samples with known RNA status for ZIKV, DENV,
CHIKV, or yellow fever virus (32). To describe variability in misdiagnosis for clinical
diagnostic criteria, we included six empirical estimates of sensitivity and specificity that
were measured in a region of Brazil with co-circulating ZIKV, DENV, and CHIKV (25).
These empirical estimates of sensitivity and specificity were derived by clinically
diagnosing a patient with Zika, dengue, or chikungunya based on different clinical case
definitions, and then ground truthing against the case’s etiology determined by RT-PCR
(25). We used the sample mean, 𝝁, and sample variance-covariance matrix, 𝚺, for the
molecular and clinical misdiagnosis rates as the mean and covariance in two
independent, multivariate normal distributions, such that

Probabilistic estimates of the proportion of Zika
We used the proportion of cases that were diagnosed as confirmed or suspected Zika,
𝑝̂:,; and 𝑝̂ :,< , where 𝑐 and 𝑠 refer to confirmed and suspected cases and the hat notation
refers to observed data. Rather than using the point estimate for 𝑝̂ :,; or 𝑝̂:,< , we made
use of Bayesian posterior estimates of these variables obtained directly from reported
Zika cases, 𝐶?:,; and 𝐶?:,< , and reported dengue and chikungunya cases, 𝐶?@,; and 𝐶?@,< ,
using the beta-binomial conjugate relationship (33). This assumed that the number of

Zika cases was a binomial draw from the total number of cases of these three diseases,
with a beta-distributed probability of success, 𝑝̂:,; or 𝑝̂ :,< . We assumed uninformative
priors on 𝑝̂ :,; and 𝑝̂:,< ; i.e., 𝑝̂ :,; ~beta(1,1) and 𝑝̂:,< ~beta(1,1). Therefore, 1 + 𝐶?:,; and
1 + 𝐶?:,< were the alpha parameters of the two beta distributions and 1 + 𝐶?@,; and 1 +
𝐶?@,< were the beta parameters of the two beta distributions. For confirmed cases, this
resulted in a posterior estimate of
𝑝̂ :,; ~betaC1 + 𝐶?:,; , 1 + 𝐶?@,; D,

and for suspected cases,

Observation model of misdiagnosis
To calculate the updated proportion of Zika among the total of Zika, dengue, and
chikungunya cases, 𝑝: , we mathematically related 𝑝̂: to 𝑝: using diagnostic sensitivity
and specificity, such that
𝑝̂ : = 𝑠𝑒 × 𝑝: + (1 − 𝑠𝑝) (1 − 𝑝: ).

(4)

We then rearranged Eq. 4 to solve for
𝑝: =

𝑝̂: − 1 + 𝑠𝑝
.
𝑠𝑝 − 1 + 𝑠𝑒

(5)

From Eq. 5, we determined two constraints for how 𝑠𝑒, 𝑠𝑝, and 𝑝̂ : can relate to one
another. The first was 𝑝̂ : ≤ 𝑠𝑒, which follows from 0 ≤ 𝑝: ≤ 1, or 0 ≤

≤ 1, and

then simplifying the inequality. The second was 𝑠𝑒 + 𝑠𝑝 ≠ 1, as this would lead to zero
in the denominator of Eq. 5. Eqs. 4, 5, and subsequent constraints were applied
independently to confirmed and suspected cases.
We used samples of 𝑝:,; and 𝑝:,< estimated from Eq. 5 to define a single distribution of
𝑝: . As estimates of 𝑝:,; and 𝑝:,< were between 0 and 1, we approximated beta
distributions for each using the fitdistr function in the MASS package in R (34) fitted to
posterior samples of 𝑝:,; and 𝑝:,< . We then reconciled differences in estimates of 𝑝:,;
and 𝑝:,< with an estimate of 𝑝: , defined as
Pr(0 ≤ 𝑝: ≤ 1) = PrC0 ≤ 𝑝:,; ≤ 1D × PrC0 ≤ 𝑝:,< ≤ 1D.

We then applied 𝑝: to 𝐶?:,; + 𝐶?:,< + 𝐶?@,; + 𝐶?@,< to obtain revised Zika cases, 𝐶: , and
dengue and chikungunya cases, 𝐶@ .
Applying the observation model
To apply our observation model to empirical data, we first drew 1,000 samples from the
beta distributions of 𝑝̂ :,; and 𝑝̂:,< and 1,000 samples from the multivariate normal
distributions describing sensitivities and specificities of molecular and clinical
diagnostics. We applied our observation model to four distinct scenarios with different
spatial and temporal aggregations to assess the sensitivity of our results to different
ways of aggregating incidence data: country-specific, temporal data (4,214 data points);
country-specific, cumulative data (43 data points); region-wide, temporal data (98 data
points); and region-wide; cumulative data (1 data point). Under each of these scenarios,
we quantified posterior distributions of 𝑝: , drew 1,000 Monte Carlo samples of 𝑝: , and
obtained distributions of 𝐶: and 𝐶@ .
Results
Illustrative example
We constructed a simple example with two generic diseases, A and B, to illustrate the
relationship between reported cases and revised cases under different misdiagnosis
scenarios. For these generic diseases, we varied the total cases of A and B such that
the proportion of cases diagnosed as A, 𝑝̂Y , varied from high to low. We used
combinations of sensitivity and specificity that spanned all combinations of low,
intermediate, and high misdiagnosis scenarios. Using the same methods applied to
reallocate Zika, dengue, and chikungunya cases, we revised estimates of incidence of
disease A in light of misdiagnosis with disease B.
Incidence of disease A was not revised when sensitivity and specificity were both low
(Fig. 3, bottom left), which was due in some cases to the constraint of 𝑝̂Y ≤ 𝑠𝑒 not being
met and in other cases to the sum of sensitivity and specificity equaling 1. When 𝑝̂Y was
high (Fig. 3, pink lines), revised incidence of A was similar to observed incidence of A,
as only high sensitivities were possible across a range of specificities (Fig. 3, top row).
With high sensitivities (Fig. 3, top row), misdiagnosis only occurred with B misdiagnosed
as A. When 𝑝̂Y was low (Fig. 3, purple lines), revised incidence of A was higher than
observed incidence, as only high specificities were possible across a range of
sensitivities (Fig. 3, right column). With high specificities (Fig. 3, left column),
misdiagnosis only occurred with A misdiagnosed as B. When 𝑝̂Y was intermediate (Fig.
3, green lines), misdiagnosis occurred both ways, as a range of sensitivity and
specificity values were possible. This resulted in scenarios in which incidence of A was
higher or lower than the observed incidence.

Misdiagnosis through time
We estimated the revised proportion of Zika cases among all cases of Zika, dengue,
and chikungunya at each time point for each country. As 𝑝̂: was low early in the
epidemic, we estimated that there were 113,459 (95% CrI: 74,595-148,575) disease
episodes caused by ZIKV that were misdiagnosed as dengue or chikungunya cases in
the fourth quarter of 2015, prior to the start of reporting of Zika in most countries (Fig.

4). Then, as Zika incidence increased and peaked in 2016, the intensity of misdiagnosis
increased (Fig. 4), but the direction of misdiagnosis differed by country, depending on
how much 𝑝̂: increased. Drastic jumps and dips in the number of Zika cases
misdiagnosed as dengue or chikungunya (Fig. 4) was a consequence of chikungunya
cases not being reported on a continuous basis (Fig. 2D).

Total Zika incidence

Revising cumulative estimates of the epidemic
We aggregated revised Zika incidence to estimate the cumulative size of the epidemic
and to compare our estimate to that based on surveillance reports. In countries and
territories with relatively high Zika incidence (𝑝̂: close to 1), such as Suriname,
Martinique, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, our revised estimates of 𝑝: closely matched 𝑝̂:
(Fig. 5, bottom). In countries with relatively low Zika incidence (𝑝̂: close to 0), such as
Brazil and Bolivia, our revised estimates of 𝑝: were higher than 𝑝̂ : (Fig. 5, bottom). In
those countries that reported no Zika incidence (i.e., 𝑝̂ : = 0), such as Bermuda and
Chile, our estimates of 𝑝: were much more uncertain (Fig. 5, bottom).

the Zika epidemic totaled 1,062,821 (95% CrI: 1,014,428-1,104,794) cases across the
Americas.
Estimates of epidemic size using different aggregations of data
We applied our observation model to different temporal and spatial aggregations of the
PAHO data, wherein we used temporal incidence data for the region as a whole (Fig.
S4), cumulative incidence data for each country (Fig. S5), or cumulative incidence data
for the region as a whole (Table 2). When using temporal incidence data for the region
as a whole, our estimate of the overall size of the Zika epidemic was 1,073,593 (95%
CrI: 1,049,660-1,101,840). Under this spatially aggregated scenario, the majority of
misdiagnosis occurred during the height of the epidemic (Fig. S2). In our analysis using
cumulative incidence data for each country, our estimate of the overall size of the
epidemic was 844,623 (95% CrI: 724,421-957,294), with country-specific estimates of
𝑝: not well-aligned with 𝑝̂: (Fig. S3). When using cumulative incidence for the region as
a whole, our estimate of the overall size of the Zika epidemic was 227,568 (95% CrI:
139,782-319,684).

Discussion
We leveraged empirical estimates of sensitivity and specificity for both clinical and
molecular diagnostics to revise estimates of the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic in 43
countries across the Americas. After applying our methods to data from PAHO, we
found that more than 300,000 disease episodes diagnosed as chikungunya or dengue
from September, 2015 through July, 2017 may have been caused by ZIKV instead. Our
revised estimates of the Zika epidemic suggest that the epidemic was more than 50%
larger than case report data alone would suggest. Additionally, our estimates show that
nearly a third of these instances of misdiagnosis occurred in 2015, prior to many
countries reporting Zika cases to PAHO (26). An illustrative example of our method
showed that these results were driven by the relative incidence of Zika and the two
other diseases. Hence, differences in our results over time, across countries, and with
respect to level of data aggregation resulted from differences in relative incidence of

Zika and these other diseases across the different ways of viewing the data that we
considered.
Some countries appeared to have higher Zika incidence than surveillance data alone
suggest, such as Brazil and Bolivia, while others appeared to have lower Zika incidence
than surveillance data alone suggest, such as Venezuela and Jamaica. In Brazil and
Bolivia, our country-specific cumulative estimates of the epidemic were 90% and 180%
larger than case report totals, respectively. In Venezuela and Jamaica, our countryspecific estimates of the epidemic were 29% and 17% smaller than case report totals,
respectively. These differences across countries can be explained by differences in the
proportions of suspected Zika cases, 𝑝̂:,< , through time. In Brazil and Bolivia, 𝑝̂:,< was
less than 0.2 at nearly every time point, whereas it mostly ranged 0.2-0.8 in Venezuela
and Jamaica. When 𝑝̂:,< was low, as in Brazil and Bolivia, the constraint that 𝑠𝑒 ≥ 𝑝̂:
allowed sensitivities to span a larger range, including lower sensitivities that would have
resulted in the inference that more cases diagnosed as dengue or chikungunya were
caused by ZIKV. When 𝑝̂ :,< was moderate to high, as in Venezuela and Jamaica, the
constraint that 𝑠𝑒 ≥ 𝑝̂: limited sensitivities to higher values, resulting in the inference
that fewer cases diagnosed as dengue or chikungunya were caused by ZIKV. Similarly,
because of a trade-off between sensitivity and specificity for clinical diagnoses, these
constraints on sensitivity also imposed constraints on specificity.
Using different aggregations of data in our analysis led to different conclusions in
multiple respects. Using cumulative data for the region as a whole led to the inference
that the Zika epidemic was smaller than suggested by surveillance data, whereas using
cumulative data at a country level led to the inference that the epidemic was larger than
suggested by surveillance data, but with variation across countries. Using temporally
explicit data led to the inference that the epidemic was even larger, regardless of
whether data was aggregated at a country or regional level. Overall, these similarities
and differences suggest greater consistency temporally than spatially in the relative
incidence of Zika, chikungunya, and dengue across countries. At least in the case of an
emerging disease such as Zika, this suggests that it may be most important to prioritize
temporal data when inferring patterns of misdiagnosis. With respect to the timing of
inferred misdiagnoses, there were more visible differences between scenarios in which
temporal data were aggregated at a country or regional level. When temporal data were
aggregated at a country level, we inferred that the majority of misdiagnosis occurred
prior to 2016. When temporal data were aggregated at the regional level, we inferred
that the majority of misdiagnosis occurred during the epidemic in 2016.
Our observation model incorporated basic features of how passive surveillance data for
diseases caused by multiple, co-circulating pathogens are generated, including the

potential for misdiagnosis and differences in misdiagnosis rates by data type. With
respect to other features of how data such as these are generated, there were some
limitations of our approach. First, we did not specify a process model of transmission
dynamics. For example, a multiple-pathogen transmission model could be fitted to
passive surveillance data on Zika, dengue, and chikungunya, using our observation
model to relate the model's predictions to the data (33). Accounting for misdiagnosis in
this way could improve a transmission model's ability to make inferences about drivers
of transmission (35–37) or interactions among pathogens (38,39). Second, we
aggregated chikungunya and dengue case data, meaning that we were unable to
explore the potential for differences in the extent to which misdiagnosis occurs between
each of these diseases and Zika. If additional studies resolve differences in diagnostic
sensitivity and specificity of Zika compared to each of these diseases separately, our
observation model could be extended to account for this. Third, our observation model
relied on a limited set of empirical estimates of diagnostic sensitivity and specificity.
Given that the use of different diagnostics could vary spatially or temporally, as could
their sensitivities and specificities (40–42), incorporating more detailed information
about diagnostic use and characteristics could improve future estimates using our
observation model.
Although passive surveillance data has been central for understanding many aspects of
the 2015-2017 Zika epidemic, our finding that there may have been 56% more Zika
cases than described in PAHO case reports underscores the need to consider the
observation process through which passive surveillance data is collated. Here, we
accounted for misdiagnosis in the observation process to revise estimates of the
passive surveillance data on which numerous analyses depend (35,43,44). The
advancements made here contribute to our understanding of which pathogen may be
circulating at a given time and place. By better accounting for the etiology of reported
cases, it could become more feasible to implement pathogen-specific response
measures, such as proactively testing pregnant women for ZIKV during a Zika epidemic
(45,46). Given the potential for synchronized epidemics of these and other co-circulating
pathogens in the future (47), continuing to develop methods that disentangle which
pathogen is circulating at a given time will be important in future epidemiological
analyses based on passive surveillance data.

Figure S2. Estimates of Zika incidence after accounting for misdiagnosis using
spatially aggregated data. Top: Violin plots of the number of Zika cases that were
misdiagnosed as chikungunya or dengue cases. Estimates above zero indicate there
were more Zika cases than perceived and estimates below zero (gray region) indicate
there were fewer Zika cases than perceived. Bottom: Reported Zika and dengue and
chikungunya incidence alongside revised estimates of Zika incidence with associated
uncertainty. Purple band is 95% CrI and green line is median estimate.
