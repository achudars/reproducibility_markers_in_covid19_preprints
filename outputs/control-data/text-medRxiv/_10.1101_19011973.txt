The prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in β-thalassemia
patients in Pakistan: a systematic review and meta-analysis
ABSTRACT
Objective: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is the most commonly reported
bloodborne infection in Pakistan. Frequent blood transfusions in β-thalassemia patients
expose them to a high risk of HCV infection. The purpose of this paper is to summarize
the current data on the prevalence of HCV infection among β-thalassemia patients in
Pakistan by using a systematic review and meta–analysis.

Design: Systematic review and meta-analysis.
Participants: β-thalassemia patients in Pakistan.
Data sources: Following PRISMA guidelines, a comprehensive literature search in
PubMed/MEDLINE and EMBASE was performed to identify published articles
reporting on the prevalence of HCV among β-thalassemia patients in Pakistan. Only
English language articles were considered. Two independent authors selected studies.
The methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using the Quality
Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies.

Results: The search conceded a total of 138 studies, of which 27 studies were finally
considered for meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of HCV in β-thalassemia patients
in Pakistan was 36.21% (95% CI: 28.98– 43.75%) based on 5,789 β-thalassemia
patients, but there was considerable heterogeneity. Meta-analysis estimated the HCV
prevalence among the β-thalassemia patients at 45.98 % (95% CI: 38.15–53.90%) in
Punjab, 31.81% (95% CI: 20.27–44.59%) in Sindh, and 28.04% (95% CI: 13.58–45.26%)

in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Meta–regression analysis showed that geographical location
was a key source of heterogeneity.

Conclusions: The pooled prevalence of hepatitis C virus among β-thalassemia patients
in Pakistan was 36.21%, but varies regionally within the country. The prevalence is
higher than in neighboring countries. With the use of standard prevention procedures
during blood transfusion, the risk of HCV transmission among β-thalassemia patients
could be controlled hence prevalence of HCV in β-thalassemia patients could be
reduced.

Keywords
Prevalence, HCV, β-thalassemia patients, Pakistan, systematic review and metaanalysis.

Strengths and limitations of this study
This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the pooled
prevalence of HCV infection among the β-thalassemia patients in Pakistan
We used of an extensive search strategy and adherence to predetermined
inclusion and exclusion criteria.
Strong and reliable methodological and statistical methods were used.
Our analyses possessed a considerable amount of quantifiable heterogeneity.
Not all regions in Pakistan were represented and most of the included studies
were hospital-based, making it difficult to generalize the findings of this review.

Introduction
The β-thalassemias are among the most common genetic diseases and affect millions of
children throughout the world. Around 1.5% (80-90 million people) of the global
1

population are carriers for ߚ-thalassaemia, with 50,000-60,000 new ߚ-thalassemia
patients being born each year. ߚ-thalassemia is most prevalent in the populations of
2

Asia, the Indian subcontinent, the Mediterranean region, Africa and the Middle East.

3-5

In Pakistan, ߚ-thalassemia is one of the commonest inherited disorders, with a carrier
frequency of 5% to 7% in the Pakistani population. ߚ-thalassemia patients are now
2

surviving to older ages due to the availability of blood transfusion and iron chelation.
There are around 100,000 patients registered currently but the burden of disease is
increasing, with 5,000 to 9,000 children born with the disorder annually. Bloodborne
6

infections are the second commonest cause of death in ߚ-thalassemia patients in
Pakistan. Patients with ߚ-thalassemia are at high risk of developing hepatitis C (HCV)
2

infection due to regular blood transfusions, especially if adequate viral screening of
blood donors has not been undertaken. The infection risk in ߚ-thalassemia patients acts
as a marker for the risk of transfusion transmitted infections in the general population
as their exposure to blood transfusions is high. If the infection rate is low in ߚthalassemia patients it means that the risk for the general population will be minimal.
Hepatitis C virus is one of the most common bloodborne viruses. More than 10
million people are living with Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in Pakistan with its associated
high morbidity and mortality. Pakistan is a developing country, and according to the
7

human development index of the United Nations, it stands in 150th position out of 189

countries and territories. The health standard in Pakistan is below the international
8

level. Therefore, transfusion of contaminated blood is still a major risk factor for the
spread of hepatitis C. This is due to the lack of appropriate donor screening and the
widespread use of paid blood donors. Several studies have been reported on the
9

prevalence of HCV among β-thalassemia patients in Pakistan and there is considerable
variation in the prevalence reported in the individually published studies. The purpose
of this systematic review and meta-analysis is to identify, select, summarize and
estimate the pooled prevalence based on the available published studies conducted on
the prevalence of HCV infection among ߚ-thalassemia patients, and its associated risk
factors in Pakistan. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and
meta-analysis to estimate the pooled prevalence of HCV infection among ߚ-thalassemia
patients in the country.

Methods
Search strategy
A comprehensive literature search on Medline, PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane
Library, and Pakistani Journals Online websites was conducted to identify studies
performed on the prevalence of HCV infection among ߚ-thalassemia patients and
published up to 31 May 2019. Using MeSH headings, the terms “prevalence”,
“epidemiology”, “seroprevalence”, ‘‘hepatitis C Virus’’, “HCV”, “hepacivirus”, ‘‘hep C,’’
‘‘thalassemia,’’,” ߚ-thalassemia”, “thalassemia major” “multitransfused blood
transfusion”, “patients”, “Pakistani”, and ‘‘Pakistan” as well as variations thereof were
searched for. The results were defined using the Preferred Reporting Items for

Checklist is attached in supplementary file S1.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies were included in the meta-analysis if: 1) Only studies published in peer-review
journals. 2) Studies conducted in Pakistan. 3) Studies reporting on the prevalence HCV
in thalassemia patients. 4) Articles published in the English language.
Studies were excluded if: 1) Studies in non-English languages. 2) Case series,
reviews, letters, and editorials or commentaries. 3) if we cannot find the prevalence
from the article data 4) Duplicates (overlapped data); for studies published in more than
one articles, the up-to-date version was considered. 5) Pakistani community living
outside Pakistan.

Data extraction
After choosing the relevant articles, two reviewers (J.A.N and S.A.) independently
screened the titles and abstracts to consider articles for full-text review, and extracted all
the necessary data using a standardized data extraction format of Microsoft Office Excel
2013. The extracted information was: surname of first author, year of study, year of
publication, geographic region (province), gender, study design, study setting (rural,
urban or both), sample size and average age of ߚ-thalassemia patients. Any
disagreement regarding the extracted information was resolved by discussion and
mutual consensus.

Evaluating the quality of the included studies
Two authors (J.A.N. and S.A.) also independently judged the methodological
quality of each included study using Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort

and Cross-Sectional Studies. Any disagreement on the quality assessment check list
11

was resolved by discussion and consensus. We categorized the quality of each included
study as good if its points was at least 70%, medium if its points were lying between
50%-69%, and poor if its points was less than 50%.

Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using the software R version 3.5.3. , using two
12

packages: meta 4.9-2 and metafor 2-0. Random effects (DerSimonian and Laird)
models were used to make point estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (95% CI),
as well as to estimate the pooled prevalence of HCV among the ߚ-thalassemia patients.
A process for combining prevalence in the meta-analysis of multiple studies was used
and the results presented in a forest plot. Random effect models are more conservative
than the fixed effect model, and have better properties in the presence of heterogeneity,
as the random effect model allows both within-study and between-study variances.

13-14

The Freeman–Tukey Double Arcsine transformation was used to stabilize the variance
prior to the calculation of the pooled estimates. Heterogeneity among the eligible
15

articles was investigated with the I² index. The heterogeneity (I -index) is categorized
16

2

as low (25%), moderate (50%) and high (75%). To determine the possible reasons for
substantial heterogeneity, univariable meta-regression and subgroup analyses were
conducted by geographical location, sample size, year of publication, year of data
collection, gender and average age of the ߚ-thalassemia patients. The existence of
publication bias was initially assessed by visually inspecting a funnel plot and then
tested using Egger’s test.

Literature search
Initially, 138 potential studies were identified. Of these, 35 were duplicates and were
removed. The remaining 103 studies were screened by title and abstract. After reading
the titles and abstracts, 62 studies were deemed irrelevant and excluded from the metaanalysis. As a result, only 41 articles were selected for full text reading. For the following
reasons 14 studies were excluded after full text read: articles with no numerical
prevalence measure(s) of HCV in β-thalassemia patients; studies that were not based in
Pakistan; studies that provided combined HCV and hepatitis B virus prevalence; studies
based on duplicated data sets or that did not meet the eligibility criteria or failed to
include relevant indicators. In the end, 27 studies met the inclusion criteria and data
were extracted for the analysis. The PRISMA flow diagram of study selection process is
presented in Fig. 1 .

Prevalence of HCV in β-thalassemia patients
Table 2 shows the summary of statistical analyses of the prevalence of the HCV among
β-thalassemia patients in Pakistan. The overall prevalence of HCV infection among
β-thalassemia patients was 36.21% (95% CI: 28.98– 43.75%, I² = 97.0%; 27 studies),
based on a pooled sample of 5,789. Forest plot of HCV prevalence among the βthalassemia patients in the three provinces of Pakistan is presented in Fig. 2. The funnel
plot (Fig. 3) visually showed no publication bias and supported by the results of Egger’s
test (p = 0.1506). Table 2 also presents the prevalence of HCV among β-thalassemia
patients for subgroups. The pooled subgroup prevalence stratified by geographical
location (province) revealed that the prevalence of HCV among β-thalassemia patients
were high 45.98% (95% CI: 38.15-53.90%; I² = 92.3%, based on 11 studies) in Punjab,
compared with 31.81% (95% CI: 20.27- 44.59%; I² = 92.8%; based on 6 studies) of
Sindh and 28.04% (95% CI: 13.58-45.26%, I² = 97.6%; based on 8 studies) of Khyber

among males (34.71% (95% CI: 23.32-47.04%)) and female (32.31% (95% CI: 20.1745.75%)) β-thalassemia patients. The prevalence of HCV among β-thalassemia patients
increased significantly with age-group: the prevalence among ߚ-thalassemia patients
below 10 years of age was 33.87% (95% CI: 18.93- 50.62%, I² = 96.2 %; 9 studies) while
above 10 years age-group 51.51% (95% CI: 34.52- 68.34%, I² = 96.2%; 9 studies). There
was no publication bias for all subgroup analyses.

[Figures 2 and 3 about here]
The results of the univariable meta-regression analysis of the prevalence of HCV in βthalassemia patients are presented in Table 3. The analysis shows that only geographical
region (province) had a significant effect on the prevalence of HCV in β-thalassemia
patients with a p-value < 0.1, while year of publication, year of data collection, sample
size, proportion of males, average age of thalassemia patients had no significant effect
on the observed HCV prevalence in β-thalassemia patients.

Discussion
The aim of this study was to summarize the available literature on the prevalence of
HCV infection among β-thalassemia patients and its associated risk factors in Pakistan.
The result of the systematic review and meta-analysis showed that the pooled
prevalence based on 27 studies was 36.21%— one in every three β-thalassemia patients
in Pakistan have already been exposed to HCV infection. The prevalence of HCV among
β-thalassemia patients, as revealed by this study is six times higher (36.21%) than in the

general Pakistani population which is 6.2% . In Pakistan, many patients with β44

thalassemia have limited access to regular and safe blood transfusions. Possible reasons
for this are the lack of altruistic voluntary blood donors and the inadequate testing of
blood donations for HCV. Many blood transfusion centers and hospitals have
inadequate resources and kits for screening blood donations. The root cause of the high
5

prevalence is predominantly the lack of adequate regulation of blood banks and
monitoring to assess compliance with transfusion safety standards. It is well recognized
that, with proper regulation driven by policy makers, transfusion transmitted infections
are markedly reduced . Pakistan is a low resource country: the prevalence of HCV in β5

thalassemia patients in Pakistan is higher than that in Iran (19%) or Bangladesh
46

47

(14.7%). The findings of this study should act as a major safety alert for decision and
policy-makers in the Pakistani health sector.
HCV infection prevalence among the β-thalassemia patients was observed across
Pakistan in all provinces except Baluchistan and Gilgit-Baltistan, as we did not find any
studies for these provinces. Our results showed that the prevalence of HCV among βthalassemia patients was higher in Punjab (45.98%) than in Sindh (31.81%) and Khyber
Pakhtunkhwa (28.04%).
In this paper, we found that the prevalence of HCV among β-thalassemia patients
rises with age, increasing from 33.87% in the under 10 years age group compared to
51.51% in the 10 years or above age group. This is undoubtedly partly due to cumulative
exposure to blood transfusions over a life time. Conversely, one could look at this more
positively and suggest that the frequency of testing for HCV positive blood donations
has improved and hence younger patients have a lower infection rate than their older
fellow patients did when they were the same age, due to safer blood donations.

Furthermore, meta-regression analyses showed that there was no significant
change in the prevalence of HCV among β-thalassemia patients over the past three
decades (with both years of publication and year of data collection). The average age of
the β-thalassemia patients was insignificant to the prevalence of HCV. Rather than age,
it is the number of blood transfusions that play a vital role in the prevalence of HCV ,
42

and we do not have data on this.
To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first systematic review and metaanalysis to summarize the current data on the prevalence of HCV infection among βthalassemia patients in Pakistan. The main strengths of this review are the use of a
predefined and a comprehensive literature search strategy, and the involvement of two
independent investigators in the whole review process and data extraction. No
publication bias was found within our analyses which suggests that we are unlikely to
have missed any significant studies that could change the findings. Furthermore, all
articles which included in this meta-analysis had a low risk of bias in their
methodological quality. As investigated by the meta-regression analysis, the
methodological quality of the studies had no impact on pooled estimates. Three
provinces of Pakistan were represented in the determination of HCV infection
prevalence in β-thalassemia patients. On the other hand, the findings of this systematic
review and meta-analysis have some limitations. Firstly, the meta-regression analysis
was only based on bivariate analysis. We planned to perform a multivarible metaregression analysis by considering all the factors simultaneously, however, it was not
possible to use multivariable meta-regression analysis due to the small number of
studies. A multivariable meta-regression analysis required at least ten studies per factor
to estimate the meta-regression coefficients efficiently. Second and as is common in

meta-analyses, our estimates revealed significant heterogeneity. It is possible that other
sources of variation may have been missed in our analysis, such as the number of blood
transfusions, type of ߚ-thalassemia and genetic factors; but we were unable to test them
due to data unavailability.

Conclusions
The overall prevalence of hepatitis C virus among β-thalassemia patients in Pakistan
was 36.21%, but varies from province to province. The prevalence is higher than in
neighboring countries such as Iran and Bangladesh. Pakistan is a developing country
and lacking in resources for appropriate blood screening facilities in thalassemia centers
and hospitals. Lack of robust policies on transfusion safety as well as appropriate and
rigorous monitoring of blood banks to ensure compliance with policies perpetuate the
risk of transfusion transmitted infection with HCV. National and regional health
programs should mandate and monitor the screening procedures so as to reduce the risk
of transfusion transmitted infections such as HCV in the general population in βthalassemia patients.
