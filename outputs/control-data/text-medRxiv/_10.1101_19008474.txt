ABSTRACT
Within-individual variability of repeatedly-measured exposures may predict later outcomes: e.g.
blood pressure (BP) variability (BPV) is an independent cardiovascular risk factor above and
beyond mean BP. Since two-stage methods, known to introduce bias, are typically used to
investigate such associations, we introduce a joint modelling approach, examining associations
of both mean BP and BPV across childhood to left ventricular mass (indexed to height; LVMI)
in early adulthood with data from the UK’s Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children
(ALSPAC) cohort. Using multilevel models, we allow BPV to vary between individuals (a
“random effect”) as well as to depend on covariates (allowing for heteroscedasticity). We further
distinguish within-clinic variability (“measurement error”) from visit-to-visit BPV. BPV was
predicted to be greater at older ages, at higher bodyweights, and in females, and was positively
correlated with mean BP. BPV had a positive association with LVMI (10% increase in SD(BP)
was predicted to increase LVMI by mean = 0.42% (95% credible interval: -0.47%, 1.38%)), but
this association became negative (mean = -1.56%, 95% credible interval: -5.01%, 0.44%)) once
the effect of mean BP on LVMI was adjusted for. This joint modelling approach offers a flexible
method of relating repeatedly-measured exposures to later outcomes.

INTRODUCTION
When exposures vary over time – for example systolic blood pressure (BP) as measured over the
life course – both the overall mean and the change in the exposure can affect later health
outcomes (1). However, within-individual variability – i.e. the extent to which an individual’s
measure fluctuates around this trend – may also be a risk factor (2).
Methodological difficulties have meant that within-individual variability in time-varying
exposures have been seldom examined, and when they are it is often using two-stage procedures,
known to introduce bias (3). An alternative, one-stage, approach is to use joint multilevel models
to relate time-varying exposures (4) to a later outcome (5). These models have recently been
extended to also examine within-individual variability (3). Such joint models leads to unbiased
parameter estimates and correct standard errors: either when relating the mean and trajectory (6),
or within-individual variability (3), of an exposure to a later outcome.
We illustrate this approach by examining the association of both mean BP and within-individual
blood pressure variability (BPV) with an established biomarker of target organ damage: left
ventricular mass indexed to height (LVMI). Whilst BPV can be measured across various time
scales (7), here we focus on the longer-term, a.k.a. “visit-to-visit”. In adults, visit-to-visit BPV
has been found to be an important predictor of subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) over
and above mean level (8). Detecting those at risk of CVD early in life is important in order to
design and administer preventative measures in a timely and targeted manner (9, 10). Mean
systolic BP in childhood is positively associated with early signs of heart damage, such as left
ventricular hypertrophy (11-13), and there is evidence from a US cohort of children that higher
BPV – as estimated via the standard deviation (SD) of the measurements across all visits
(conducted every 2-3 years) for each person – is associated with adult hypertension, independent

of mean BP levels (14). However, there has been little investigation of the role of BPV on early
target organ damage, despite its potential utility as a predictive factor (15), and only limited
analysis of the factors associated with childhood BPV (14, 16).
Our aim was to explore the factors associated with within-individual BPV in a UK cohort of
children using multilevel analyses, and to extend these to joint models to investigate the
association of both mean BP and BPV with LVMI in early adulthood.
METHODS
Participants
The participants are from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents And Children (ALSPAC), an
ongoing prospective longitudinal birth cohort study based in SW England (17-19). Pregnant
women resident in Avon, UK with expected dates of delivery 4/1/1991 to 12/31/1992 were
invited to take part in the study. The initial number of pregnancies enrolled was 14,541 resulting
in 13,988 children alive at 1-year of age. When the oldest children were approximately 7 years of
age, an attempt was made to bolster the initial sample with eligible cases who had failed to join
the study originally, ultimately increasing the number of enrolled pregnancies to 15,454, with
14,901 children alive at 1-year of age. The study website
(http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/) contains details of all the data that is
available through a fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool.
5,217 of the participants attended an ALSPAC study clinic at mean age 17.7 years, of whom a
random subsample of 2,047 (all singletons) had their LVMI (left ventricular mass in grammes,
indexed to height in m2.7, i.e. g/m2.7) measured via echocardiography (20, 21) (exclusion criteria
included pregnancy and congenital heart disease; see below for a comparison of the subsample

modelled with the larger sample enrolled in ALSPAC, and Boyd et al. (17) for a discussion of
attrition in ALSPAC). Echocardiography was performed using an HDI 5000 ultrasound machine
(Phillips Healthcare, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) equipped with a P4-2 Phased Array
ultrasound transducer by one of two experienced echocardiographers using a standard
examination protocol (21).
1,988 of these participants had their systolic BP (SBP), height and weight and age recorded, on
at least one prior occasion (research clinic). These clinics were at c. 7.5-, 9.5-, 10.5-, 11.5-, 13-,
15.5-years of age. At each clinic, the participant’s SBP (in mmHg) was measured at least twice,
using a validated electronic monitoring device and a cuff size appropriate for their upper arm
circumference, with the participant sitting and at rest with the arm supported. Each of these
measurements was available for our analysis from each clinic, apart from the clinic at c.10.5
years of age, for which only the mean was available.
Statistical analysis
The covariates we included for SBP were age (for further details, see below), sex, an interaction
between age and sex, weight, height, and a number of maternal characteristics including parity
(the number of previous pregnancies resulting in either livebirth or stillbirth), age at delivery, and
highest educational qualification. Sex, age and weight, as measured at the clinic at c.17.7 years
of age, were included as exposures for LVMI, but height was not, as LVMI is indexed to height.
All continuous covariates were centred around their grand mean prior to analysis. Weight, as
measured across childhood, and LVMI were log-transformed prior to analysis.

We used a joint model to relate BPV to subsequent log(LVMI). We describe this modelling
approach below, building up model complexity using an example which assumes that SBP
increases linearly with age across childhood (we later relax this assumption).

the mean function for BP, there are individual-level random effects for the intercept ( ; mean
BP at  = 0) and also for rate of change (  ; BP slope), with within-individual (between-clinic)
error  . In standard multilevel models, the variance of the within-individual error is assumed to

( ), and also on an individual-level random effect  (with a log-link ensuring that the withinindividual variance remains positive). Within-individual variability in blood pressure, log(BPV),
is therefore allowed to change with age (as estimated here via  ). The random effect  allows
each individual to have their own estimate of log(BPV). This is a mixed-effects location scale
model, as described and demonstrated by Hedeker et al. (22, 23); see also Goldstein et al. (24). It
is also possible to allow for coefficients of covariates within the within-individual variability
function to randomly-vary across individual: for example allowing the coefficient for age ( ) to
randomly-vary to investigate whether its association with BPV differs between people (25).

This model can be expanded to include the later individual-level outcome (log(LVMI), measured
at c.17.7 years), producing a joint model with shared random effects, as follows:

measurement error, which we assume is not related to log(LVMI) (  ), will incorporate both

Following previous work modelling SBP across these ALSPAC clinics, we allowed for a nonlinear relationship between age and mean SBP by fitting a linear spline with a knot point at 12
years (26, 27). The spline variables were derived as follows (where  = age in years) (28):

These spline terms were fitted as fixed effects in the mean function for SBP. Since allowing the
coefficients of these terms to randomly-vary across individuals lead to convergence problems in
some models, a linear term for age fitted across the whole age range was fitted as a random
effect. We assumed that BPV had a linear association with age.
Appendix 2 includes estimates from sensitivity analyses designed to (a) investigate the influence
of the submodel for log(LVMI) on the random effect estimates; (b) compare a parameterisation
modelling clinic mean BP with current models; (c) check whether restricting the analysis sample
to those with LVMI measures had any effect on model for change in SBP, examining possible
selection bias; (d) investigate sex as the only observed covariate, for comparison with published
findings elsewhere (14, 16).

We used Bayesian estimation via MCMC methods in Stan (2.19.1) (29, 30), called from R (31)
using the rstan package (32). See Appendix 3 for examples. Appendix 4 provides further details
of estimation.
Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and
the Local Research Ethics Committees. Informed consent for the use of data collected via
questionnaires and clinics was obtained from participants following the recommendations of the
ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee at the time.
RESULTS
Two observations at the individual-level, eight at the clinic-level, and one at the measurementlevel (36 measurement-level observations in total) were identified as outliers in quantile-quantile
plots of residuals from preliminary models and were removed from the dataset prior to further
analyses. The resulting dataset comprised 1,986 individuals attending 10,556 clinic sessions with
19,360 recorded BP measurements.

Table 1 compares the participants included in the analysis with those 12,318 ALSPAC children
who were not included (but were recruited in an eligible ALSPAC phase, singletons, and
otherwise recorded as alive at 1 year of age). There was evidence that the included participants
were more likely to be female, had mothers who had had fewer children and were more educated
and healthier than those not included.

Figure 1 plots mean SBP against mean age for each clinic for those included in the model,
indicating sample sizes for each clinic. The mean number of clinics attended was 5.3.
<Table 2 here>
Table 2 summarises 3-level joint analyses in which both SBP trajectory and log(LVMI) are
simultaneously modelled, with age centred around the sample mean of 11.3 years. With just age
and sex as observed covariates (in model A), mean SBP was predicted to increase with age. The
rate of increase was similar for males and females up to the age of 12 years, with mean BP
predicted to increase more steeply for males at older ages. With regard to within-individual
variance, with each year of age, BPV was predicted to increase by mean = 15.6% (95% credible
interval (CI): 12.9%, 18.4%), or if expressed as the predicted increase in SD(BP): mean = 7.5%
(95% CI: 6.2%, 8.8%). Females’ BPV was predicted to be mean = 16.7% (95% CI: 4.5%,
30.4%) greater than that for males (SD(BP): mean = 8.0% (95% CI: 2.2%, 14.2%)). Age at time
of echocardiography was estimated to have a modest negative association with LVMI, and
females were predicted to have smaller values of LVMI.
In model B, with weight and height now added as further covariates, mean SBP was predicted to
increase with greater weight and height. With regard to BPV, this was estimated to be larger with
greater log(weight): specifically, for a 10% increase in weight, BPV is predicted to increase by
mean = 5.8% (95% CI: 2.1%, 9.6%) (SD(BP): mean = 2.6% (95% CI: 0.7%, 4.5%)). The
estimated effect of height on log(BPV) was negative, with a substantial portion of the posterior
containing positive values as well (BPV predicted to decrease by mean = -0.4% (95% CI: -1.4%,
0.7%) per 1cm increase in height). Otherwise, weight was predicted to have a positive
association with LVMI.

Finally, in model C, maternal characteristics were added as covariates in the mean function for
SBP (with a slight drop in sample size due to fewer observations for these variables). This
predicted a modest positive association of mean SBP with mother’s age at delivery, lower mean
SBP with higher parity, and with mean SBP generally predicted to be lower with more advanced
highest educational qualifications. The estimated associations between the observed covariates of
age, sex, height and weight and mean SBP were substantively similar whether maternal
characteristics were included in the model (C) or not (B).
Focusing on Model C, this estimated a small negative correlation (r = -0.09 (95% CI: -0.21,
0.03)) between mean BP and BP slope: i.e. those with higher mean BP at 11.3 years were
predicted to have a smaller increase in their mean BP across age. Otherwise, a large positive
correlation (r = 0.50 (95% CI: 0.33, 0.71)) was estimated between mean BP and log(BPV): i.e.
individuals with higher mean SBP at 11.3 years also tended to have more fluctuation in their
SBP, whilst the correlation between BP slope and log(BPV) was estimated as negative, and small
(r = -0.05 (95% CI: -0.34, 0.23)).

The SD of the BPV random effects on the log scale was estimated to be mean = 0.42 (95% CI:
0.29, 0.53). Figure 2 plots predicted within-individual SDs from this model, by sex, for the sexspecific mean value of the covariates within the within-individual variance function for each
clinic. In addition, Figure 3 plots examples from this model of three individuals randomly-drawn

individual-level patterns of SBP measurements at each end of the observed range of estimated
BPV.
<Table 3 here>
<Table 4 here>
In the models in Table 2, all random effects have been included as predictors of the individuallevel outcome, log(LVMI). Table 3 contrasts the estimates of these random effects from model C
to those in which the effect of each set of random effects on log(LVMI) is tested without
adjustment for the other random effects on log(LVMI) (but with the remaining structure of the
model otherwise remaining the same; see Appendix 2 for full estimates). When mean BP is the
only random effect included as a predictor of LVMI, higher mean BP is associated with higher
LVMI. The same is true when the random slope and the log(BPV) random effects are alternately
added as predictors of LVMI. With regard to the log(BPV) predictor, a 10% increase in BPV is
predicted to increase LVMI by mean = 0.21% (95% CI: -0.23%, 0.69%) (or a 10% increase in
SD(BP) is predicted to increase LVMI by mean = 0.42% (95% CI: -0.47%, 1.38%)). As Table 3
further indicates, when all three random effects are included as predictors of LVMI, then the
estimated association between log(BPV) and LVMI becomes negative; specifically, a 10%
increase in BPV is estimated to be associated with a decrease in LVMI by mean = -0.78% (95%
CI: -2.54%, 0.22%) (or a 10% increase in SD(BP) is associated with a decrease in LVMI by
mean = -1.56% (95% CI: -5.01%, 0.44%)). This model also estimated a positive association of
mean BP with LVMI (a 1mmHg increase in BP at the sample mean age was predicted to increase
LVMI by mean = 0.59% (95% CI: 0.12%, 1.37%)) and of change in mean BP with LVMI (a
1mmHg increase in the slope was predicted to increase LVMI by mean = 3.56% (95% CI:
0.01%, 7.92%)). Table 4 details mean LVMI for individuals grouped into tertiles of the random

effect estimates for mean BP and log(BPV). It demonstrates that within strata of mean BP,
higher values of BPV are generally associated with lower mean LVMI.
As Appendix 2 further discusses, a range of sensitivity analyses yielded substantively similar
estimates to the models presented here.
DISCUSSION
Using data from a prospective longitudinal birth cohort study cohort study based in the UK, we
used a joint modelling approach to examine the factors associated with visit-to-visit BPV across
childhood, and the association of both mean BP and BPV with an established biomarker of target
organ damage, LVMI, in early adulthood. BPV was estimated to be larger – i.e. individuals’ SBP
was estimated to fluctuate more greatly – at older ages, in females, and at greater bodyweights.
BPV also had a large, positive correlation with mean BP (at the sample mean age of 11.3 years),
but only a very small correlation with the rate of change in BP (slope) across age. In a model
which did not adjust for the effect of mean BP and its slope on LVMI, BPV was estimated to be
positively associated with LVMI. When mean BP and its slope were introduced as exposures of
LVMI, however, the direction of association between BPV and LVMI changed to a negative one.
These models further estimated a positive association of mean BP with LVMI and of change in
mean BP with LVMI.
Whilst we are not aware of other studies in this age range which have reported on the effect of
weight and height on BPV, the effect of age, sex and race have been examined. Investigating
BPV in children aged 8-18 years in Massachusetts, Rosner et al. fitted variance components
models to BP measurements taken within- and across-visits (up to a maximum of 16 visits over
four years), and subsequently examined the effect of age, sex and BP level on these two variance

components in three-way ANOVAs (16). They found “no meaningful effects” of these covariates
on variability of SBP (the effect of BP level was significant, but judged to be small; correlation
coefficient not reported). More recently, in an analysis of the Bogalusa Heart Study in the USA,
Chen et al. measured visit-to-visit BPV in children aged 4-19 years by taking the SD of 4-8
measurements of clinic mean SBP from visits scheduled every 2-3 years (14). Males were
estimated to have significantly higher SD(SBP) than females, and SD(SBP) was estimated to be
significantly greater for blacks than for whites. Our supplementary analyses (Appendix 2) also
indicated that females were estimated to have lower BPV than males, but not once the effect of
time-varying covariates were adjusted for. In addition, and in keeping with our findings, Chen et
al. found a positive correlation (r = 0.15) between mean childhood BP level and SD(SBP) (14).
Such a positive correlation has been characterised in studies of adults too (8, 33).
Whilst several studies have found a positive relationship between adult BPV, independent of
mean BP, and later cardiovascular events such as stroke (8) and all-cause mortality (33),
evidence for the relationship between BPV and target organ damage (as indicated by left
ventricular hypertrophy, for example) is more equivocal (34, 35). In a recent review, Dolan &
O’Brien described contrasting results with regard to the association of visit-to-visit BPV and
cardiovascular outcomes, suggesting differences between (adult) study populations, such as
underlying cardiovascular risk, may be an important determinant of such heterogenous findings
(7). With regard to the relationship between childhood BPV and adult biomarkers, Chen et al.
found childhood visit-to-visit SD(SBP) to be significantly associated with adult hypertension
(14). This remained the case after adjusting for mean childhood SBP, although elevated
childhood SBP levels were found to be more predictive of adult hypertension than childhood
BPV. We have previously demonstrated that in 17 year-olds, higher body mass index (BMI) is

causally related to higher LVMI, suggesting that there is meaningful variation in cardiac
structure measures in early adulthood that is likely to track across life and relate to later life
cardiovascular health (36). Nevertheless, in the current study the positive association between
childhood BPV and LVMI in early adulthood did not persist once childhood mean BP had been
adjusted for. In fact, within strata of mean childhood SBP, higher BPV was associated with
smaller values of LVMI. Whether it is appropriate to adjust for mean BP when assessing the
association of BPV with LVMI somewhat depends on whether one has a causal model in mind
which conceptualises mean BP as causing both BPV and LVMI (in which case adjustment for
mean BP as a confounder might be appropriate), or whether no causal relationship is proposed
between mean BP and BPV (i.e. other, unknown, factors cause mean BP and BPV, and each in
turn has a causal relationship with later LVMI), in which case it may not be appropriate to adjust
for mean BP. If the purpose is prediction, on the other hand, then by simultaneously estimating
the effect of mean BP, its slope, and BPV on the later outcome, we allow for a more complete
appraisal of the association of repeatedly-measured BP with LVMI. Note that whether mean BP
is adjusted for or not, the association of BPV with LVMI was estimated to be small, with
appreciable uncertainty as to whether it was non-zero, or indeed of the opposite sign.
The results also indicated that mean BP (at the sample mean age), and change in mean BP, were
both positively associated with LVMI in early adulthood. Analyses of the Georgia Stress and
Heart Study and the Bogalusa Heart Study have also found mean BP in childhood (37), and its
slope from childhood to young adulthood (38) and in adolescence (39), to be positively
associated with left ventricular hypertrophy in adulthood.
If we assume that selection into our analysis only depends on measured variables such as sex of
child, education and age of mother, then their inclusion as covariates will result in unbiased

models. If, having conditioned on such covariates, inclusion in our models is related to the
exposure (SBP) and/or outcome (LVMI), then there will be bias. A priori, this seems relatively
unlikely, however: e.g. such biomarkers are not readily-observable in a manner which would
typically influence one’s participation in a study. Whilst there were fewer observations for the
maternal characteristics (cf. child-based covariates) included in some models, the proportion of
missing data was relatively modest (8-9%), and estimates for parameters common to each model
were substantively similar.
The general class of model we have used could be employed to examine within-person
variability in any repeatedly-measured exposure, relating it to later individual-level outcomes of
interest within a joint model: e.g. the association between glycaemic variability and mortality
(40), variability in gait and risk of falling in older adults (41), and variation in prostate specific
antigen and prostate volume (42). We have focused on within-individual variability, but interest
may lie in characterising within-clinic (inter-individual) variability instead. In addition, the
models can be readily adapted for binary variables, time-to-event data (3), etc. (with additional
adjustments made as appropriate to accommodate e.g. autocorrelation in the case of intensive
longitudinal measurements such as ambulatory BP).
We have supplied example code to demonstrate how these models can be fitted using a Bayesian
framework (using Stan (30) and BUGS (43): see Appendix 3, which also includes discussion of
how many repeated measures are needed to estimate these models. Endeavours to fit such
models are being actively extended to other software packages too (44, 45)). Whilst fitting these
models involves greater computational burden and complexity compared to a two-stage
approach, the latter is known to introduce bias (3). Joint models have been recently employed to
examine within-individual variability (3). We further extend these by investigating the

association of time-varying covariates with within-individual variability, allowing us to examine
residual BPV unexplained by known factors, and also by distinguishing between-clinic from
within-clinic variability. As such, the joint modelling approach we have introduced offers a very
flexible method of exploring the factors associated with within-individual variability.
