Table of Contents Summary:
This study reports the results of a randomised controlled trial evaluating a novel, evidencebased, theory-informed pediatric eye-health information pamphlet for parents.

What is known on this subject: Lack of parental awareness of signs of pediatric eye disease
(leukocoria and strabismus) delays consultation with healthcare professionals (help-seeking),
contributing to late diagnosis and poor outcomes. Providing parents with relevant health
information can improve their child’s health outcomes.
What this study adds: Using an RCT to evaluate a novel health intervention, this study
demonstrates that providing parents with evidence-based, theory informed pediatric eyehealth information can improve their knowledge and help-seeking intentions if leukocoria or
strabismus are observed in their child.

ABSTRACT:
Background and Objectives: Early diagnosis and intervention is essential to achieve optimal
outcomes for most pediatric eye diseases. Educating parents/caregivers to recognize early
signs of disease and consult a healthcare professional is critical to achieving this aim. We
evaluate the effectiveness of an eye-health information pamphlet on parents’ level of concern
and their help-seeking intention if they observed leukocoria or strabismus.
Methods: Pregnant women attending a metropolitan antenatal clinic were recruited to the
study. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a pamphlet on either pediatric eye
health (intervention) or strategies for play (control). The primary outcome measure was a
change in the parents’ level of concern if they observed leukocoria or strabismus. The
secondary outcome measure was a change in their help-seeking intention if either sign was
observed.
Results: Of the 518 women enrolled, 382 (73.7%) completed the post-test survey. At followup, women who received the intervention were more likely to report a higher level of concern
if they observed leukocoria (OR 1.711 [CI: 1.176-2.497] p=0.005]) and were less likely to
have a delayed help-seeking intention. (OR 0.560 [CI 0.382-0.817] p =0.003) No change in
the level of concern for strabismus was identified between the groups; however, at follow-up,
women who received the intervention were less likely to delay help-seeking (OR 0.318 [CI
0.125-0.806] p=0.016).
Conclusion: Providing parents with relevant, evidence-based information can significantly
improve their knowledge and positively influence help-seeking intentions if leukocoria or
strabismus are observed.

BACKGROUND:
Pediatric eye disease can range from relatively minor (e.g. congenital nasolacrimal duct
obstruction) to potentially blinding (e.g. cataract) or fatal. (e.g. retinoblastoma). Generally,
parents (or primary caregivers) will be the first to observe any direct clinical sign or symptom
associated with these diseases prompting consultation with a health-care professional (helpseeking). To ensure timely diagnosis and treatment of pediatric eye disease, parents must be
aware otherwise asymptomatic signs that can occur during their child’s early infancy and
childhood, and where and when to seek eye-health consultation.

Systemically asymptomatic signs such as leukocoria (white pupil) and strabismus
(crossed/turned eye) are commonly associated with significant eye disease such as cataract
and retinoblastoma.1, 2 Leukocoria can easily be dismissed by parents due to the absence of
concomitant physical symptoms; when it is only observed intermittently; or is only apparent
in photographs (photo-leukocoria) and thought to arise as a photographic artefact.3

Although strabismus is usually idiopathic with a prevalence of between 1-6%4-7, undiagnosed
and untreated it leads to amblyopia and abnormal development of stereopsis.4, 5 Less
frequently, but more significantly, strabismus develops secondary to severe vision loss8;
systemic disease9; or to intracranial10 or intraocular pathology.1 Whilst intermittent or even
constant strabismus is a common finding in healthy newborns, normal binocular coordination should be achieved by approximately 4 months of age.11, 12 Any persisting
strabismus after this time should be investigated to exclude any serious secondary disease.

Currently, parents in Victoria, Australia are not provided with any information regarding
signs of paediatric eye disease to be alert to. There is a pressing need to provide relevant

information regarding ocular development during childhood and signs not to be ignored. The
aim of this study was to evaluate an eye-health information pamphlet specifically designed to
improve knowledge and help-seeking intention if parents observed strabismus or leukocoria
in their children.

METHODS
Study design:
Using a pre- /post-test design, this double-blind, randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared
participants’ responses to two clinical scenarios and statements of belief when faced with
observing leukocoria or strabismus in a child. This study was approved by the Royal
Women’s Hospital Human Research Ethics Committee (#17-38) and adhered to the tenets of
the Declaration of Helsinki. Following study commencement, no significant changes were
made to the study protocol.

Participant eligibility criteria and study setting:
Participants were recruited from the antenatal outpatient clinic in a large metropolitan
hospital in Victoria, Australia. Prima- or multiparous women aged over 18 years in their 2nd
or 3rd trimester of pregnancy were invited to participate in the study. The study materials
were only available in English.

Intervention and Control Arms:
The intervention consisted of a 4-sided, A5 information pamphlet for parents describing
normal developmental milestones for infant vision and ocular development; information
about strabismus and leukocoria; and recommendations for seeking health advice if observed.
The pamphlet as described in Supplementary Materials A, was specifically designed using an

evidence-based approach to developing health promotion materials14 and grounded in a
theoretical model for behaviour change.13, 14 The control group received an A4 double-sided
information pamphlet for parents: “Playing with your baby”. This pamphlet encourages
strategies for engagement with a newborn and is described in Supplementary Materials B.

Adherence to the intervention:
Following informed consent, completion of the baseline survey and randomization (0-time),
participants in both groups were verbally advised by the recruiting researcher SES to read the
instructions and pamphlet enclosed in their allocated, sealed research envelope. Two-weeks
after baseline (0-time + 2 weeks), participants were sent a secure link by email to complete
the follow-up survey using the Research Electronic Data Capture tool (REDCap 7.2.2

©

Vanderbilt University). Reminder emails were sent at 0-time + 4 weeks, and 0-time + 5
weeks and a final telephone call was made at 0-time + 6 weeks. Non-responders at the close
of the study were recorded as being lost to follow-up. No inducements were offered although
at enrolment, participants were advised that those who at the conclusion of the trial were
found to have been randomized to the control group, would also receive the intervention.

Measures and Outcomes:
At baseline, participants answered socio-demographic questions pertaining to age, previous
experience with infant development, primary language spoken at home, educational
attainment and professional background. Participant health literacy was measured by
embedding the five questions of Domain 9 “Understanding Health Information” of the
validated Health Literacy Questionnaire (HLQ).15

The evaluation survey comprised four- or five-point Likert scale items and single item
True/False questions specifically developed for six clinical scenarios and 20 statements of
knowledge or belief. To maintain masking of the participants to the specific focus of the
study and aiming to minimize any additional search for information they would not otherwise
be prompted to undertake after baseline not all questions related to infant vision or ocular
health.

To evaluate participants’ knowledge and help-seeking intentions if they observed leukocoria
or strabismus in their child, a single clinical scenario and statement of belief each pertaining
to leukocoria and strabismus were embedded in the survey. Socio-demographic questions
were excluded from the follow-up survey and replaced with questions examining
participants’ pamphlet engagement. To account for any other sources of information that may
contribute to their responses in the follow-up survey, questions relating to searching for more
information were also included. (Supplementary materials C) Either baseline or follow-up
surveys took less than 10 minutes to complete.

Outcomes:
The primary outcome measure for this study was a change in the level of concern if the
participant observed leukocoria or strabismus as measured on a 4-point Likert scale for a
clinical scenario and a statement of belief. For example: “How concerned are you?” a) not at
all concerned; b) somewhat concerned; c) concerned; d) very concerned; and in response to
the statements: “I would be concerned if I saw a white pupil in a photograph of my child” or
“I would be concerned if noticed my 2-year-old baby’s eye turning (cross-eyed) some of the
time”: a) strongly agree; b) agree; c) disagree; d) strongly disagree. The secondary outcome
measure was a change in help-seeking intention if the parent observed either leukocoria or

strabismus as measured on a 5-point Likert scale. “How quickly would you seek advice?” a)
today/tomorrow; b) within 1 week; c) within 1 month; d) longer than 1 month; e) not at all.
We hypothesized that women receiving the intervention would demonstrate an increase in
concern if leukocoria or strabismus were observed and demonstrate a change in their helpseeking intention.

Sample size and power calculation:
Using STATA (Release 14, 2015),16 a sample size of 398 participants (199 in each group)
was calculated to confer 80% power to demonstrate a 10% effect with a two-sided p=0.05 as
we could not be certain of the direction of the intervention effect. Allowing for a 30%
attrition rate, the study aimed to recruit 520 participants. All analyses were performed on an
“intention-to-treat (ITT)” method, regardless of whether those in the intervention group read
the pamphlet or not. Statistical analyses were computed using R, Version 3.5.017

Masking, randomisation and implementation:
Sealed, opaque research envelopes labelled either Group A or B were prepared by two
research assistants from the Centre for Eye Research Australia familiar with the conduct of
clinical trials. The control pamphlet was folded in half to ensure the research envelopes in
both groups were equal in weight and composition. Group allocation of the intervention was
determined by the research assistants preparing the envelopes.

A concealed, randomization allocation sequence generation table for two groups, Group A
and B, with a 1:1 allocation [2,4,6, block design] was prepared by the statistician (PGS) using
R, Version 3.5.017 and uploaded to REDCap. Using the REDCap randomization module,
upon completion of their baseline survey each participant was automatically randomized to

either Group A or B and given their corresponding research envelope by the recruiting
researcher (SES). To SES remained masked to group allocation, participants were instructed
to not open their research envelope until after leaving the hospital grounds following their
antenatal appointment.

All research participants and researchers directly associated with the trial remained masked to
participant group allocation until the conclusion of the study and data were analyzed. The
study was described to participants as one of maternal and child health, without disclosing the
specific focus of the study or the intervention being tested.

Statistical analysis:
Differences among survey responses across treatment groups and follow-up periods were
investigated using ordinal logistic mixed model regression analysis. Potentially confounding
variables including age, English as a second language at home, previous experience with
children, educational attainment, health literacy and past occupational experience in
healthcare were adjusted for in the analyses. Specifically, for each outcome measure a ‘Group
x Time’ interaction term was assessed and retained in the model if statistically significant,
thus indicating a differential response rate across treatment groups at the follow-up compared
to baseline visit. Unless otherwise specified, all statistical tests were two-sided, where p ≤
0.05 was considered statistically significant.

All participant demographic variables were used to screen for factors that could moderate the
outcome of the intervention. Comparison between prima- and multiparous women served as a
surrogate for ‘usual care’, providing insights into information parents may have already
received or been exposed to in the course of raising their children.

Baseline and follow-up surveys were self-administered using REDCap. This secure,
password-protected, web-based data management system is hosted by The University of
Melbourne under licence from Vanderbilt University. Each participant’s record was allocated
a unique study identifier and data de-identified for statistical analysis.

RESULTS:
Participant recruitment and study flow:
Figure 1 outlines participant recruitment during the study period of 8 March 2018 to 24 June
2018. Of the 692 invited to participate, 518 consented, completed the baseline survey and
were randomized to either the intervention or the control group, representing a 74.9%
participation rate. The 20 women who ‘failed to proceed’ initially consented but were called
to their antenatal appointment prior to completing the baseline survey and did not wish to
continue following their appointment. Six participants formally withdrew following
randomization and were excluded from the analysis.

Despite receiving reminders as outlined in the protocol, 382/518 women completed the
follow-up survey representing a 73.7% overall response rate. Some women attended their
antenatal appointment with their partner. When both parents were present, the pregnant
woman provided informed consent and completed the survey; however, the partner was
neither encouraged nor discouraged from contributing to the decision-making as this could
not be controlled for when the participant completed the follow-up survey at home.

Participant demographics:
Generally, participants were tertiary-educated with high health literacy. More than two-thirds
of the cohort did not have any other children and few or none had had any previous

experience with leukocoria or strabismus. There was no statistically significant difference in
demographic characteristics between participants allocated to either the intervention or
control group. (Table 1).

Primary outcomes:
Primary outcomes for both leukocoria and strabismus are described in Table 2. At follow-up,
participants randomized to the intervention group were more likely to report a higher level of
concern when faced with the clinical scenario describing leukocoria in a photograph of their
child. (OR 1.711, [CI 1.176,2.497] p=0.005) For all participants, those who searched for
more information about leukocoria had an almost 3-fold higher odds of being more
concerned (OR 2.778, [CI 1.743,4.455] p<0.001). Participants in the intervention group were
less likely to disagree with the statement: “I would be concerned if I saw a white pupil in a
photograph in my baby” (OR 0.407, [CI 0.267,0.618] p<0.001). Searching for more
information about strabismus was associated with a 62% decrease in the odds of disagreeing
with this statement (OR 0.379, [CI 0.211,0.672] p=0.001) Moreover, participants referring to
their pamphlet when completing the follow-up survey were less likely to disagree. (OR 0.541,
[CI 0.309,0.941] p=0.030)

For the clinical scenario describing strabismus in a child, there was no statistically significant
difference in the level of concern between the intervention and control groups at follow-up.
However, participants who looked up more information about strabismus at follow-up had a
2-fold increase in the odds of being more concerned about this sign. (OR 2.009, [CI
1.128,3.579] p=0.018). Moreover, participants referring to their pamphlet to complete the
follow-up survey were less likely to disagree with the statement: “I would be concerned if I

saw my 2-year-old baby’s eye turning (cross-eyed) some of the time” (OR 0.400, [CI
0.225,0.707] p=0.002).

Secondary outcomes:
As shown in Table 3, responding to the clinical scenario for leukocoria, participants in the
intervention group were less likely to delay seeking health advice (OR 0.560, [CI
0.382,0.817] p=0.003), as were participants who searched for more information on strabismus
(OR 0.427, [CI 0.248,0.725] p=0.002). Responding to the clinical scenario for strabismus, for
all participants there was a 2.7-fold increased odds of seeking advice sooner at follow-up (OR
2.744, [CI 1.384,5.442] p=0.004). Whilst group allocation in isolation did not have a
predictive effect on help-seeking intention for the strabismus scenario, an interaction effect
between follow-up visit and group allocation was observed, whereby at follow-up,
participants who received the intervention were less likely to delay seeking advice (OR
0.318, [CI 0.125,0.806] p=0.016). Moreover, participants who spoke a language other than
English at home were more likely to seek advice promptly (OR 0.218 [CI0.098,0.482]
p<0.001).

DISCUSSION:
This study demonstrated that providing women with appropriate information about
leukocoria and strabismus could improve their knowledge and guide their help-seeking
intentions. Specifically, participants in the intervention group were more likely to
demonstrate an increased level of concern and were more likely to seek advice quickly if they
observed leukocoria. However, if they observed strabismus, the intervention group’s level of
concern did not differ, although their intended time to help-seeking was significantly shorter
than the control group. Neither age of the participants nor whether they had other children

predicted their level of concern or help-seeking intention. Previous studies has revealed that
providing health information to parents can lead to improved health outcomes in their
children.18-21

Compared to the control group, those in the intervention group had a significant increase in
their level of concern and help-seeking intention if they observed leukocoria, demonstrating
the positive effect of the intervention for this sign. Given group allocation did not predict a
participant’s level of concern for strabismus likely suggests they were already familiar with
this condition. However, the highly significant interaction effect observed between the
intervention group at follow-up positively predicted help-seeking intention for this sign.
Here, we might conclude that whilst participants were already aware that strabismus could
occur in children, they were unfamiliar with the urgency with which medical advice should
be sought and the intervention appropriately guided their help-seeking behaviour.

Few participants confirmed searching for more information after completing their baseline
survey and it is possible participants under-reported their self-directed research, which could
bias these results. Curiously, self-directed research on white pupils as well as strabismus
predicted an increase in their level of concern if they observed leukocoria. People who
observe photo-leukocoria may regard it as an artefact caused by a camera flash or room
lighting and thus overlook its potential seriousness.22 Therefore, in this RCT, either some
participants also did not think leukocoria could be a significant finding, remaining
unmotivated to search for information, or the information encountered about leukocoria was
not medically informative. It is not clear why searching for strabismus might have predicted
an increased level of concern for leukocoria. We postulate that information encountered

during their searches about strabismus may have referenced leukocoria, and that when the
two occur together, prompt attention is imperative.

Whilst few participants reported referring to their pamphlet or the internet to answer their
follow-up survey, it is notable that participants in the intervention group were more likely to
refer to their pamphlet. This could suggest they recalled the information was contained in
their pamphlet, unlike the control group who referred to the internet. Moreover, referring to
their pamphlet was weakly associated with increasing levels of concern for leukocoria and
strabismus as well as predicting help-seeking intention for leukocoria. It is possible that the
pamphlet clarified for the reader when strabismus might be normal or pathological, giving
rise to poor vision or a sign of more sinister disease. Despite these findings, the numbers were
small, and it is possible not all participants reported referring to their pamphlet to complete
the follow-up survey.

An equal number of participants in both the control and intervention groups already had
children. One might expect that those who already had children would have received any
currently provided pediatric eye-health information; may have been exposed to information
via print or social media; or that they might have been motivated to seek out information
themselves if they felt it was required. Given a participant’s previous experience with
children did not predict level of concern or help-seeking behaviour confirms that information
about leukocoria or strabismus is not currently provided.

The observed changes in the level of concern and help-seeking intention may be attributed to
the Question-Behaviour Effect, whereby merely being asked a question, individuals will over
predict their behaviour.23 That is, faced with a hypothetical scenario, the individual would

seek help sooner than if faced with the same situation in real life. Studies reporting delayed
diagnosis of retinoblastoma attribute parents’ slow response to strabismus because it is
familiar or they expect it to resolve spontaneously; and leukocoria because it is not obvious
or visible all the time.24 Together with the fact the child is otherwise well and is unlikely to
demonstrate an overt sign of poor vision, parents delay seeking advice. Thus, one cannot be
certain that the hypothetical responses observed in the RCT reported herein would necessarily
translate to parents actually seeking health advice promptly.

Limitations
The single-centre study design may have unintentionally biased the outcomes. Although
participants’ demographic characteristics were equally distributed between the two groups
and were adjusted for confounding variables, their homogeneity may have contributed to the
positive outcomes observed in this study. Strong literacy skills and command of the English
language may have enabled them to engage more fully with, and understand the contents of,
the intervention.

In this study, fathers or partners contributing to the RCT could neither be prevented nor
controlled. Thus, it is not known whether a difference of opinion may have tempered or
intensified their concern or help-seeking intention. Other than for mental health and
behaviour25, few studies have explored a father’s (or partner’s) role in child health and helpseeking compared to the mother’s.26 Although no significant differences between mothers’
and fathers’ knowledge and attitudes towards seeking eye-health care for their children have
been identified27, the distinction between maternal and paternal help-seeking behaviour is not
usually made, referring only to ‘parental’ behaviour.28-30 Future studies could consider

comparing responses between both parents to determine whether there are any differences, as
these would need to be addressed to optimize health promotion initiatives.

The time between receipt of their pamphlet and the follow-up survey was short (2 weeks).
Thus, participants may have had a better recall or retention of information than would
normally occur. Nonetheless, this study did establish that providing information that can be
understood and interpreted by parents can improve knowledge and help-seeking behaviour.
This study could be extended in the future by repeating the follow-up survey at a later timepoint to better understand parent recall of information and effect on help-seeking intention.

CONCLUSION:
Although these study findings are not generalizable, they do provide significant, previously
unreported insights into community knowledge of leukocoria and strabismus, and helpseeking intentions if observed. For pediatric eye diseases with presenting signs of leukocoria
or strabismus, educating parents to remain vigilant and how to respond may result in earlier
diagnosis, treatment and improved outcomes.
