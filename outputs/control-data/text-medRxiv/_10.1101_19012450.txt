Clostridioides difficile (CD) is a spore-forming bacterium that causes life-threatening intestinal
infections in humans. Although formerly regarded as exclusively nosocomial, there is increasing genomic
evidence that person-to-person transmission accounts for only <25% of cases, supporting the culture-based
hypothesis that foods may be routine sources of CD-spore ingestion in humans.
To synthesize the evidence on the risk of CD exposure via foods, we conducted a systematic review
and meta-analysis of studies reporting the culture prevalence of CD in foods between January 1981 and
November 2019. Meta-analyses, risk-ratio estimates, and meta-regression were used to estimate weighedprevalence across studies and food types to identify laboratory and geographical sources of heterogeneity.
In total, 21,886 food samples were tested for CD between 1981 and 2019 (232 food-sample-sets; 79
studies; 25 countries). Culture methodology, sample size and type, region, and latitude were significant
sources of heterogeneity (p<0.05). Although non-strictly-anaerobic methods were reported in some studies,
and we confirmed experimentally that improper anaerobiosis of media/sample-handling affects CD recovery
in agar (Fisher, p<0.01), most studies (>72%) employed the same (one-of-six) culture strategy. Because the
prevalence was also meta-analytically similar across six culture strategies reported, all studies were
integrated using three meta-analytical methods. At the study level (n=79), the four-decade global cumulativeprevalence of CD in the human diet was 4.1% (95%CI=-3.71, 11.91). At the food-set level (n=232), the
weighted prevalence ranged between 4.5% (95%CI=3-6%; all studies) and 8% (95%CI=7-8%; only CDpositive-studies). Risk-ratio ranking and meta-regression showed that milk was the least likely source of CD,
while seafood, leafy green vegetables, pork, and poultry carried higher risks (p<0.05). Across regions, the
risk of CD in foods for foodborne exposure reproducibly decreased with Earth latitude (p<0.001).
In conclusion, CD in the human diet is a global nonrandom-source of foodborne exposure that
occurs independently of laboratory culture methods, across regions, and at variable level depending on food
type and latitude. The latitudinal trend (high CD-food-prevalence towards tropic) is unexpectedly inverse to
the epidemiological observations of CD-infections in humans (frequent in temperate regions). Findings
suggests the plausible hypothesis that ecologically-richer microbiomes in the tropic might protect against
intestinal CD colonization/infections despite CD ingestion.

Clostridioides (Clostridium) difficile (CD) is a spore-forming anaerobic bacterium that causes severe
enteritis, colitis, and mortality in susceptible humans, especially if affected with inflammatory bowel diseases,
cancer, immunosuppression, or if taking antibiotics.110-1213 To date, it is well known that CD infections (CDI)
in humans are more frequent in temperate regions. Latitudinal trends however have not been reported for
CDI at continental scales. Since the first report linking CD to pseudomembranous colitis in 1975, several
reports now indicate that CD could reach humans via foods.2 If the presence of C. difficile in foods was
indeed linearly associated with infections, one would expect that the prevalence of food contamination was
higher in temperate regions as it is the case for the incidence of CDI in humans.
CDI have now worsened severity and incidence since the emergence of hypervirulent strains that
caused CDI epidemics in both Canada and the UK in the mid 2000s. After the astounding isolation of such
strains from young cattle and retail beef in Canada in 2005 3,4 numerous food studies support the hypothesis
of potential foodborne exposure 5,6. With the availability of genomics, elegant studies have shown that only
~25-30% of CDI in hospitals are nosocomial, redirecting the attention to foods as viable sources of CD. 89
As further evidence for connectivity between foods and CDI, last year a de novo genome sequencing study
showed that the first CD strain derived from foods (PCR ribotype 078) in Canada in 2005 was identical to the
historical strain M120 that contributed to epidemics in the UK in 2007 7.
Unless we understand the distribution pattern of CD across foods, regions, and laboratory variability,
little can be done to minimize the exposure of susceptible persons to CD in their diet. Distinguishing
methodological variability from natural variability is important to assign a proper risk value to the presence of
CD in the food supply 2. To formally quantify the prevalence of CD in foods and map the distributional trends
over global scales, we conducted a systematic review and meta-regression of studies reporting the presence
of CD in foods. The main quantitative objectives were i) to appraise peer-reviewed studies on quality and the
prevalence of CD in foods, ii) to determine laboratory factors associated with CD-positivity, and iii) to perform
meta-analysis across regions, and food items to examine reporting differences and outline latitudinal trends.
Herein, we report that the majority of studies used the same laboratory culture method for the isolation
of CD allowing us to conduct meta-analysis and rank food items based on the weighted risk of contamination
across regions. Although beef and pork were food categories often containing CD, leafy green vegetables
and seafoods had higher rates of contamination. Of remarkable novelty, the contamination of foods followed
a latitudinal trend that is inverse to the Earth’s latitude (higher towards the Equator). Although there are no
global reports describing latitudinal trends for CDI, results indicate that the latitudinal trend observed in foods
is inverse to that of what is reported and expected for infections (i.e., high incidence in temperate regions).

Systematic Review, Team and Definitions. This study follows and complies with principles of
systematic review research methodology for ‘food safety’ and food item definitions.14,15 All procedures used
in this study were reported in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses (PRISMA) guidelines in structuring our literature search analysis.
We conducted a systematic search of available literature reporting the prevalence of C. difficile in
foods. Electronic databases (MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) were
searched to identify all studies reporting the prevalence of CD in foods. The detailed search algorithm,
questionnaire, data extraction criteria and verification are available as Supplementary Materials. Five
iterative rounds of verification of extraction strategies and tools were validated to ensure reproducibility of
data extraction.
In brief, a list of search terms was developed by consensus by the research team to retrieve citations
pertaining to CD prevalence in foods. Search terms (n= 64 terms) relating to population (e.g. food, meat,

beef, etc.) and outcome (e.g., Clostridium Clostridioides difficile) were combined to search numerous food
types (or items), without restrictions. Identified terms were pre-tested in PubMed and used to develop the
final algorithm, using as basis a similar validated strategy we implemented for vegetables. 19 The complete
search terms consisted of the following: “(C. difficile OR Clostridium difficile OR difficile) AND (food* OR
meal* OR mollus* OR fish OR crustaceans OR oysters OR poultry OR chicken OR turkey OR duck OR
goose OR meat* OR beef OR pork OR venison OR dairy OR milk OR yogurt OR cheese OR egg* OR

OR melon OR mushroom OR carrot OR potato OR garlic OR radish OR corn OR peas OR cucumber OR
tomato OR pepper* OR alfalfa OR sprout*)", and was used to search Web of Science, Scopus Cochrane and
Pub Med. The search was repeated regularly and database updated until the last update in November 2019,
prior to the manuscript submission.
Citations retrieved from electronic databases were imported and de-duplicated in reference
management software EndNote WebTM (Clarivate Analytics). Search verification included manual searching
of references citing the first five manuscripts reporting CD in foods or its potential for foodborne transmission
9, 10, 26, 44, 45
using Google Scholar in consultation with research team members, and the references of all
identified studies. Experts in the field were consulted to identify unpublished data, including theses and
research poster/conference presentations. Google Search Engine limited to the first 600 hits was searched
to identify any “gray literate”. Alert in Google Scholar was set up to identify any newly published studies. All
potentially relevant citations discovered through the manual searching method, which were not previously
identified through electronic search, were added into the review process and processed in the same manner
as electronic citations. All peer-reviewed studies, dissertations and reports containing original prevalence
data were eligible. Studies lacking the report of both number of samples tested (N) and number of positive
samples (n) were excluded. 32 Prevalence contamination data was only extracted for culture assays, and not
for prevalence data based on molecular assays. 27 No restrictions were imposed in terms of the study time
period, design, language, or study origin.
Relevant citations after reviewer screen 1 (RS1) were procured as full articles, and screened by two
reviewers (BS and SI) using pre-tested RS2 checklists (Supplementary Tables 1 and 2). Conflicts were
resolved by a consensus between respective reviewers and when not possible, by senior authors of this
study. During initial manual screening of selected abstracts, carcass trims or carcass washings/rinsates at
the processing plants were selected for secondary analysis. Data describing environment, wastewater,
animal or human fecal samples were excluded. Non-primary research studies (e.g. narrative reviews) and
studies investigating other aspects (e.g. outbreak reports, test performance studies) were excluded. Case
reports or case series of hospital-associated C. difficile infections, and case-control studies that did not
provide prevalence estimates, and duplicate publications were also excluded. Relevant articles were
assessed and categorized by food type (e.g. beef, poultry, vegetables) and descriptive characteristics (e.g.,
food processing level, where in the production chain was the product sampled). Through initial title and
abstract-based relevance screening one (RS1), potentially relevant primary research articles were identified.
Extraction Tool and Risk of Bias. Prior to reading the manuscripts, two meeting sessions (phone,
and in person) took place (ARP, SI, BS, and AD) to discuss and create a Data Extraction Tool (DET, list of
questions and response categories, see Supplementary Table 1) draft to standardize the extraction of data
required for statistical analysis and testing of study objectives. Following five iterative rounds of verification
for accuracy and clarity, the pre-final extraction tool was pretested by ARP and BS at CWRU, and SI and JM
at OSU, using 10 studies (the first five in the 1980s, and 5 in 2015) 9, 10, 26, 44, 45. Phone conferences occurred
biweekly during this phase to estimate test agreement, to address concerns, to edit/improve, and thus
finalize the DET. The pretesting and definitive data extraction were conducted after the participating
reviewers (KM, BS) were trained on laboratory methodologies available for CD by senior scientists from two
institutions (ARP and SI). Four reviewers extracted data independently. Data extraction was verified by

senior two authors for data interpretation, extraction and accuracy. The final DET was used to extract all
relevant research articles, which were assessed for methodological soundness and bias as part of the data
extraction strategy, by at least two reviewers, using the prevalence study-based criteria.
All studies were assessed by rating each of the 6 quality assessment items listed in the DET into
dichotomous ratings: low risk (1) and high risk (0). An overall Risk of Bias score was calculated by adding
the numeric value of all six items. High scores indicate low risk of bias and stronger method quality.
Measures of data SD or variability were estimated using the number of food samples tested and the
percentage of positive samples. Because the reliability of available statistical methods on bias have
previously shown to be inaccurate and misleading with effects that are close to the extremes, for instance
close to 0 or to 100% 24, publication bias was tested using funnel plot and Egger’s statistics using study size
at the food set level instead of the standard error of the effect as recommended for proportions with high
data /effects polarity 24. As we recently mentioned 25 however, it is uncertain how many studies start but do
not get published due to the lack of a prepublication registry of prevalence based studies in foods.
Pooled Ratios, Meta-analysis and Meta-regression. Extracted data were used to estimate risk
ratios and perform a prevalence meta-analysis. Three main categories of data were extracted: sample
characteristics, methods, and prevalence data. All food items were grouped for analytical purposes into food
item categories (e.g., pork, leafy green vegetables). Pooled risk ratios (RR, 95% CI) for each food group
were calculated to quantify the differences and rank the foods according to the risk of being contaminated
using a random effects model 2618 In brief, heterogeneity tests with Higgins’ I2 statistic were performed to
determine the extent of variation between the studies that rely on measure analysis for the deviations for
each within-study variance from a central estimate for the collective between-study variance distribution. 26
Meta-analysis was used to estimate the overall prevalence of CD in foods globally and per region by pooling
variances of proportions in a random-effects model using DerSimonian and Laird method. 28,29 Analyses
were performed using R software and Metaphor 33, and Stata’s Metaregression and Metacum functions. To
illustrate the cumulative meta-analytical prevalence of CD globally and regionally at the ‘study-level’ (n=79),
over the past 4 decades, we analyzed and plotted the data as a forest plot as previously reported 25.
Because each study tested multiple ‘food item categories’, we then decomposed the study variance across
each food item, within each study, and constructed the remaining forest plots at the item level presented in
this study. Exact binomial weighted and pooled estimates at ‘item level’ (n=232) are presented in forest plots
both without adjusting for ‘zero-studies’ (which excludes 0% prevalence studies), and with adjustments using
either a balanced addition of 1 to n and N, or using the Freeman-Tukey double arcsine transformation, which
include 0% prevalence studies. 33 For meta-regression and latitudinal analysis, coordinate data were
obtained from NASA. To determine if the reported prevalence was influenced by the amount of food tested,
data were extracted as absolute values in grams. Modeling and latitudinal simulations were conducted in R
and STATA 33 (Supplementary Materials).
Experiments with C. difficile on non-anaerobic media. The exposure of CD spores to conditions
suitable for grow (high moisture, nutrients, and warmth) trigger spore germination even in room air. However,
the subsequent step, i.e., bacterial growth from germinated spore to cell division does not occur in the
presence of air/oxygen. Because i) most studies did not report whether the reagents or the handling of foods
in growth media were fully anaerobically, and because ii) the germination of CD spores and the subsequent
viability of vegetative daughter cells are influenced by the lack of strict anaerobiosis, we determined if a
source of low CD recovery and study variability could be partly due to negative selection when non-reduced
reagents are used. To test this hypothesis we platted 1-year old (superdormant) spores aged for 1 year in
PBS as described 36 on TSA agar enriched with 5% defibrinated sheep blood. Two different pre-reduced
agar conditions, which only differed on the length of time the agar had been incubated (pre-reduced)
anaerobically before being used for bacterial inoculation using our Parallel Lanes Plating method.37
Role of the Funding Source. This study was conducted with internal funds allocated to investigators,
with no external funding in the form of grants or industry awards. Study design, data analysis, interpretation,
and writing are thus free of funding-associated bias.

Global Distribution of Studies Reporting C. difficile in Foods and Publication Bias
The PRISMA-standard Figure 1 summarizes the process of studies selection for this systematic
review. From 1,939 studies identified, 79 fulfilled the inclusion criteria for meta-analysis, involving >231
authors and 25 countries over the past 37 years. The list of studies in chronological order from the Americas
6,18,19,34,35,38-67
, Europe 23,68-88, Asia 89-103, Africa 104-109, and Oceania (Australia/New Zealand) 20,110,111 is
presented in Table 1. Eleven (13.9%) of all studies reported the absence of CD in the food samples tested
(CD-negative). Only 30% of studies (n=24) were dedicated to testing only one type of food. Most studies
tested between 2 and 4 food types. Funnel plot analysis indicate there has been absent-to-moderate
publication bias, depending on the statistical method used for the funnel analysis to consider data handling
of reports close to 0% prevalence as illustrated in Figure 2.
Historical Study Referents of C. difficile Isolation from Foods.
This meta-analysis illustrates the geographical distributions of the numerous laboratories around the
world that have been examining the potential of foodborne transmissibility of CD spores to humans, via the
food supply. Figure 3 depicts in a map the arithmetic average of the CD prevalence reported for local food
items across countries, and other descriptive features of the studies. Of note, since the first report, there
have been periods of oscillations possibly reflecting trends in research interest or funding availability.
Historically, the first study attempting to quantify the prevalence of CD in ready-to-eat foods was
published by Fekety et al., in 1981 42 in a hospital setting. Using a direct culture approach (effective for
isolation of CD from environmental surfaces) on hospital meals, this study yielded no CD. The following year,
two reports highlighted the potential foodborne and zoonotic potential of CD transmission to humans
(Borriello et al.,1982 and 1983)21,115 but a period of quiescence lasted until 1996, when Broda et al.116 made
a food science report of incidental isolation of CD from spoiled ‘blown-packed’ meats in New Zealand.
Google citation statistics of Broda’s publication indicate that her findings were only relevant to food spoilage
studies, and not cited on ‘public health’ or ‘food safety’ reports due to human health concerns until a report in
2006 discovered the presence of hypervirulent epidemic CD strains in food-producing animals and retail beef
in Canada 5,6. No citations of Broda et al. occurred on the basis of foodborne/health concerns between 19962006 (0 vs. 30 citations on meat spoilage), but steadily increased to 27 foodborne citations after the 2006
reports 5,6 (51 citations on meat spoilage, mainly due to Clostridium estercholaris; Fisher’s p<0.001). Citation
analyses support the reproducibility and historic context of our systematic review, with minimal publication
interest on the ‘foodborne potential of C. difficile’ before 2006. See Figure 4 for a graphical representation of

the historical context and order in which numerous laboratories around the world tested food items intended
for human consumption since 1981.
Although the cumulative prevalence of CD in the foods tested has been 4.1% globally at the studylevel (two-tail 95%CI=- 3.71, 11.91, Table 1), we demonstrate that the cumulative prevalence has distinct
patterns of heterogeneity (variance) depending on the region, being comparably lower at the study-level in
Europe (1.9%; 95%CI= -7.49, 11.29; see Figure 5 for cumulative estimates in other regions).
Overall Food Contamination: Food-type level analysis.
Because most studies (>75%) tested more than one ‘food-item type/category’ (e.g., ‘beef’,
‘vegetables’; 2.95±1.8 categories/study), and because pooling data from distinct food categories as a single
CD prevalence for each study was deemed biologically inappropriate, and non-informative to generate foodbased risk ranks, we extracted data separately for each food item tested in all studies. Thus, together, this
meta-analysis represents 21,886 samples of retail foods tested across 230 ‘food item sample sets’. On
average, each food set comprised 92±127 samples; maximum=956. For the pooled analysis, the 232 food
sets were grouped into 20 food categories (e.g., ‘pork’, ‘seafood’, ‘mixed meats’), being ‘beef’ the most
studied commodity (see cumulative statistics in Supplementary Table 3). Reported CD prevalence at the
‘food-category level’ ranged from 0 to 100%.
As a single unweighted statistic, the arithmetic mean for the CD prevalence in foods at the food-type
level was 10.6±16.6% (Supplementary Table 4). Because differences exist across regions and food tested
categories, and because estimations depend on the inclusion of data from zero prevalence studies, we then
computed the overall adjusted weighted meta-analysis cumulative prevalence considering the sample sets
and regions, and three statistical methods to account for the 0% prevalence in CD-negative studies. Notice
that Figure 6 illustrates the heterogeneity (I2 statistics) across regions and the 230 food sets, at the same
time it illustrates that the overall of C difficile in foods ranges between 4.5% (95%CI=3-6%, for all CDpositive and CD-negative studies combined) and 8% (95%CI=7-8%, for the CD-positive studies only).
Heterogeneity and Overall Prevalence of C. difficile in Foods is Independent of Culture Method
To date, one of the most cited factors to explain differences in CD across food studies is the
existence of variability across methods and reagents (Supplementary Table 5). Although we have not seen
recovery differences for antibiotics used as selective reagents in food studies (cycloserine-cefoxitin vs.
cysteine hydrochloride-norfloxacin-moxalactam, CDMN)11719, we examined the role that culture methods play
in this meta-analysis.
Although studies clearly report the use of anaerobic jars 23, culture media (e.g., CDMN, BHI), and
homogenization methods for sample disruption (e.g., stomachers, blenders) which mix samples with room
air, unfortunately, most studies did not specify clearly if reagents were pre-reduced (incubated anaerobically
prior to utilization) or if protocols were anaerobic 38,69,104. Because 73.4% of studies did not use positive
controls (58/79; Supplementary Table 6), it is impossible to infer if protocols were fully anaerobic. To test if
the incubation of CD spores in non-reduced media (e.g., agar freshly removed from refrigerator) inhibits CD
recovery, we conducted experiments in vitro. Using 1-year-aged spores from human PCR-ribotypes 078,
027, 077, strains 630 and ATCC 1869 7,36,65, we observed that the use of non-reduced agars results in no CD
recovery compared to using agars pre-reduced in an anaerobic chamber 4 hours prior inoculation (0/10 vs.
10/10, Fisher exact p<0.001). Because 26.9% of studies also reported short periods of incubation (e.g.,
overnight), we determined if short incubation influenced CD recovery. Of relevance, aged CD spores grew
slowly requiring ~72 hours to produce the same surface biomass (per colony on agar) as the produced by
vegetative cells in 24 hours. Although results indicate that nonreduced media and short incubations could
yield negative results, we deemed these to be common error factors randomly distributed across methods.
Thus, we next examined the role of overall culture strategies, by cataloguing and grouping all
reported methods into six different categories based on sequence of isolation steps and three culture
strategies: i) direct plating on agar, ii) enrichment of the foods using liquid media prior to culture on agar, and

ii) the use of ethanol or heat to eliminate non-spore forming microbes in foods prior to culture in liquid media
or agar to favor the growth of CD spores. Frequency analysis showed that almost three-quarters of all food
samples tested (70.8%) used the methodological strategy reported in the first index report of CD in foods in
2006 5,6. Confirming that the five remaining methods had comparable CD recovery, univariate and weighted
predictive meta-analysis, showed that all the six methods were statistically similar (see Figure 7).
Publication bias, journal impact factor, and the amount of food tested were also ruled out as sources
of variability. However, we discovered that the number of samples tested per food set correlated inversely
with CD prevalence (linear regression p=0.007; meta-regression p=0.067 controlling for region/method,
Supplementary Figures 1-2 and Supplementary Table 7). Although seasonality has yielded heterogeneity
in food animals (i.e., low prevalence in summer; high in winter in temperate regions), seasonal variability
could not be tested since 85.9% of studies did not include referents or surrogates for season. Together,
Figure 7 and the analysis described illustrates that different culture strategies cannot explain the prevalence
heterogeneity reported in the literature, and confirmed that all studies can be integrated in this meta-analysis.
Contamination Risk Analysis Ranks Vegetables and Seafoods as High-Risk Food items.
Of relevance to risk statistics, over one-quarter of food sets were CD negative (64/232; 27.8%,
95%CI= 22.2, 32.2). However, from a clinical perspective, doctors and patients could benefit by knowing
which foods are more likely to be contaminated to determine how diets can be adjusted during periods of
increased susceptibility (e.g., cancer, IBD). For instance, by cooking or avoiding high-risk foods.
Since different food items could be contaminated with different probability risks, we calculated risk
ratios (RR) to rank each food group with respect to the food yielding the lowest combined prevalence of CD,
and also using meta-analysis weighted estimates (Figure 8). Using milk as a reference (which had the
lowest prevalence, but clinically important CD strains) 22, vegetables, seafoods and pork had the highest RR.
Compared to milk, vegetables were 21.9 times more likely to yield CD, while seafoods and pork were 14.3
and 12.9 times more likely, respectively. Figures 9, 10, 11, and 12 comparatively illustrate the weighted
prevalences for the following food categories: beef and vegetables, poultry, pork and seafood. Comparing
retail beef, leafy-green vegetables and root vegetables, Figure 9 illustrates that leafy green vegetables are
twice more as likely to carry CD compared to root vegetables. Supplementary Figures 3-5 display detailed
forest plots for both statistical methods for beef and vegetables, and for all the food tests tested including
mixed meals, and others based on the biological origin (animal/plant) of the food.
The Probability of Recovery C. difficile from Foods Increased Latitudinally Towards the Tropic.
To determine whether the prevalence of CD in foods was influenced by Earth’s latitude, we added
the positional coordinates to the dataset. Both unadjusted and arcsine adjusted meta-regression revealed
that latitude determines the magnitude by which CD has been isolated from foods worldwide. While longitude
was nonsignificant, latitude had a negative linear correlation with CD prevalence (in a 𝑦 = b0 + b1c1 model;
Figure 13a). Since several studies reporting high prevalence were from mid-range latitudes, collectively the
data displayed a concave pattern (in a 𝑦 = b0 + b1c1 + b2c12 model; Supplementary Figures 6-7). However,
after dividing the 230 food sets into 22 food-per-continent subsets to control for longitude (e.g., beef in Africa
vs. Asia), regression slope analysis (in 𝑦 = b0 + b1c1) showed that latitude negatively correlation with
prevalence in 94.5% of the 22 data subsets (Sign p<0.0001). Such reproducible correlation was not due to
chance, since random allocation of latitude values in 25 simulations showed nonreproducible slopes (Sign
p=0.35). Findings were also validated using predictive spatial density map simulations on a 2D-plot
representing the Earth’s surface (Figure 13b-e, adjusted p<0.001). Contour-density plots illustrate that the
patterns of CD have a spatial latitudinal structure that is different from simulations of randomly spaced
studies. For the first time, the prevalence of CD in the human diet is shown to have a latitudinal pattern over
the Earth’s latitude. Occurring reproducibly across continental longitudes, with comparatively higher CD
prevalence in regions closer to the tropic, this CD-in-foods trend is opposite to what is expected for CDI in
humans, where most cases seem to occur more often (in temperate regions) away from the tropic.

The present meta-analysis, for the first time summarizes the distribution of CD in the human diet,
which we derived from data from 79 studies conducted between 1981 and 2019. Estimated various regional
and global prevalence of CD in foods ranged between 3 and 8% globally, or between 0 and 22% regionally.
We also identified for the first time a latitudinal trend in foods with increased rates of CD recovery in food
towards the tropic. The analysis of almost twenty-two thousand samples across the globe, as a robust
representation of the human diet, indicates that prevalence heterogeneity exists independently of culture
methods. While study variability has been assumed to be consequence of culture method differences, our
analysis (verified using I2 statistics) demonstrates that there were no significant differences for the CD
prevalence across methods, and that most studies used the same methodology. Prevalence estimates also
varied within studies conducted by the same author, which cannot be explained by variations in culture
methods. Often, the same method was applied to different food items yielded different rates of CD
contamination under the same report. Such differences reflect real variance of CD in the food supply.
Although earlier articles speculated that the identification of CD in foods could have been due to
poor techniques and cross-contamination, high-quality studies have shown that contamination is an obsolete
argument to discount the value of identifying toxigenic and even emerging virulent strains of CD in the food
supply, which have been shown to be genetically similar to strains of clinical relevance in distant regions7.
Because a number of studies reported 0% of CD, it is possible that there are natural sources of
contamination heterogeneity in foods, similarly to other known foodborne pathogens. There is substantive
evidence to support that the risk changes as a function of climate, and latitude. It has been established that
the tropic has ecologically greater microbial diversity 127, but how such diversity could determine the
presence of C. difficile in the food supply across regions is uncertain. If CD contamination is higher toward
lower latitudes, possible explanations could include that more diverse microbiomes in the gut, environment,
127
and foods towards the tropic could prevent CD colonization and CDI, since CDIs are more often reported
in temperate latitudes.
Our study only examined the reported prevalence of CD in food items, regardless of the toxinogenic
potential of the identified isolates, assessed on culture cells or in susceptible hosts. Virtually, every study
recovering CD have determined that the isolates have had at least one of the three toxins or genes needed
to fulfill the criteria for CD toxigenicity (tcdA, tcdB, cdtA/B). Similarly, numerous studies have used molecular
methods to determine the epidemiological distribution of the isolates in human hospitals. However, because
the performance, acceptability, and generalizability of molecular typing methods vary across regions, and
because there is no a single unified system for CD strain typing or nomenclature worldwide to make
meaningful comparisons at global scales, we refer the readers to the original publications to examine the
strength of the genomic evidence reported in each epidemiological study. As historically highlighted, we
emphasize that there is molecular evidence that the presence of CD in the human diet is genuine and not
due to laboratory cross contamination with CD from human specimens. Major examples include the
complete genome sequence of the first food derived PCR-ribotype 078 isolates from foods in Canada that
matched contemporary strains affecting humans in the UK, in the mid 2000s, when there was no physical
connection between the laboratories that reported both studies7. Supporting the remarkable risk for CD
exposure via seafoods, we also highlight the latest report of CD in foods conducted in the Adriatic Sea where
mussels and clams contaminated at a mean prevalence of 16.9% (CI: 14.1%–19.8%) carried a large
proportion of CD representing diverse genotypes commonly isolated in European hospitals (113 CD isolates
represented 53 genotypes, with 40.7% of them belonging to CD seen in CDI in hospitals).133
Although the present meta-analysis showed significant latitudinal heterogeneity, one of the
limitations of the reported studies, and therefore the coordinate data used for the analysis, is that the
latitudinal positioning of the samples collected and processed by each of the study authors is inferred for
each research center, and it is not the actual coordinates of origin of each sample which was not reported in
any study. However, since the analysis is conducted at the global scale and it is considered to be a proxy for

the exposure risk, for all studies, which is relevant for the local communities in the districts sampled by the
researchers, the analysis and findings are deemed pertinent and good indicators of the effect of latitudinal
positioning and the CD prevalence trend observed at the global scale. Lastly, most studies have been
conducted in Northern regions, however, to increase the study power we normalized all latitudes by squaring
the latitudinal coordinates as the distance from the equator toward both hemispheres which is
mathematically and geo-positionally standard method to gain statistical symmetry around latitude 0
(equator).
In summary, this study does not intend to make inferences/comparisons between north and south
hemispheres. It only addresses the effect of absolute coordinates, which by the virtue of being positive (by
squaring negative coordinates), they may be more representative or inflate the ecology in the north latitudes.
Because local climates vary in opposing terms as latitude increases toward the poles (winter in north,
summer in south, and vice versa, not controlled in this study because precise temporal referents were not
reported in the reviewed studies) it is advisable that future studies provide databases containing the
coordinates, day/month of the year and air temperature for each sample, and the CD test results to validate
and further test the latitudinal trend and hypothesis herein generated in this systematic review.
In conclusion, it is reasonable to infer from our analysis that there is no a single number that
summarizes the complexity of CD in the human diet worldwide. Until the dynamics of CD over space and
time are better defined, doctors could advice patients and communities at risk to cook their meals better and
give other simple suggestions, such as avoiding high-risk foods that are commonly consumed raw (e.g.,
fresh produce), until the patient’s susceptibility to CDI decreases. From a clinical and prevention perspective,
patients could benefit by knowing which foods are more likely to be contaminated with CD to determine how
to adjust their diets during periods of increased susceptibility. Considering that ~10% of the samples in this
study (~20 grams per sample, over 1 overfilled tablespoon) were contaminated with CD, which represents
only a fraction of an average meal size per person, it is possible that consumers are exposed to CD very
frequently. If a person consumes 500 g of food per day, estimates could suggest than in average one table
spoon full of meal in every 13 (260 grams of meal) could be contaminated with CD, if not cooked properly.
Basic recommendations emphasizing food safety practices updated to CD (using >85oC for 10 minutes, or
even better, boiling temperatures) 65,66,118,119120, could prevent inadvertent exposure especially if patients are
affected with debilitating conditions that increase the risk for CD intestinal colonization and infection. Future
publications should include in their design and reporting descriptors for climate, ambient temperature,
season and latitude.

weighted estimated prevalence vs. standard error of estimated prevalence, however, such strategy is
misleading towards suggesting there is publication bias when used on proportion based meta-analyses if the
reported effects are close to zero86. The alternative panel to the right is weighted estimated prevalence vs
sample size86. b) Histogram. Study distributions categorized based on total number of food/nonfood item

Figure 6. Forest plot of weighed prevalence of C. difficile at ‘Food-category’ level. (‘food item sets’,
n=232). A version in PDF that can be magnified to high resolution is available in FigShare. Each plot
represents different analytical strategies that differed on the method used for data transformation to deal with
‘zero’ prevalence reports. Data ranked by author and year. See estimates (ES) and weights (W) for each
region in green and shaded ovals. Note that the confidence intervals (CI) overlap irrespective of analytical
adjustments. a) Meta-analysis conducted with untransformed proportions. This mathematically excludes food
sets with 0% prevalence (red font, approx. 25%). b) Meta-analysis conducted after adding 1 to the
denominator and numerator (n/N), and after using the Arcsine Transformation of the raw data which forces
the inclusion of adjusted data derived from ‘zero’ prevalence. Note the ranking of studies excluded in plot
panel a (red font), are re-ranked in adjusted analyses. The smaller size of circles with the arcsine
transformation illustrates better adjustment of heterogeneity. Confidence intervals are exact binomial
(Clopper-Pearson). P<0.05 indicates pooled prevalence is different from zero. I2, heterogeneity test, p<0.05
indicates the ‘true effect’ across studies is not the same. Random-effects, DerSimonian/Laird statistics. Click

Figure 8. Global risk ranking of foods based on probability of carrying C. difficile illustrates higher
heterogeneity for pork, poultry, seafood and vegetables. A version in PDF that can be magnified to
limiteless resolution is available in FigShare. a) Hierarchical unsupervised analysis of reported prevalence of
C. difficile (CD) in various food items (y-axis labels) across regions and studies (x-axis). Note that several
studies processed various types of foods. na, not tested. b) Ranking of foods based on the expected risk of
carrying CD (Relative Risk Ratios [RRR] and 95% CI). Note that the RRR ranks beef, poultry, pork, and
vegetables at different levels although they cluster together in panel a, which clusters these products
together because those were more commonly tested across regions. Horizontal bars connect products with
statistically similar RRR. Distinct superscripts denote statistical differences, Chi-square p<0.05. c) Metaanalytic display of weighed prevalence estimates at the ‘food set’ level. Top panel displays data from all
studies, including ‘zero’ prevalence reports (Arcsine transformation, homogeneous adjustment for variability,
see comparably-sized small circles), while the top panel displays data of only positive studies (larger
variably-sized circles, see area within rectangular polygon). Vertical ovals in top panel highlight
representative clusters of reports describing high prevalence of C. difficile in certain foods, supports raking
statistics in Panel b. Leafy green vegetables are ranked high since estimates are from studies with larger
sample sizes/more weighed influence (small circles, narrower CI in bottom panel; larger circles in arcsineadjusted top panel). Click to RETURN TO RESULTS SECTION

Figure 9. Comparative global and regional prevalence of C. difficile in beef and vegetables. Forest
plots using the Arcsine Transformation of the raw data force the inclusion of adjusted data derived from
‘zero’ prevalence studies. Confidence intervals (CI) are exact binomial. Rectangular ovals denote overall
estimates. Shaded ovals, region estimates. Back ovals denote overall estimates from unadjusted metaanalysis (detailed plots with higher prevalence estimates from unadjusted data to include only CD positive
studies are in Supplementary Figures 3 and 4). Note larger variability among studies conducted with
vegetables (wide overall CIs) when compared to variability for beef products (narrow overall CI). Leafy green
vegetables are twice more commonly found to contain CD compared to root vegetables. Analysis of these
three food type categories, based on weighed mean prevalences, ranks leafy green vegetables as more
likely to carry CD, and beef products the least likely. Click to RETURN TO RESULTS SECTION

Figure 13. The probability of recovering C. difficile from foods increases towards the tropic. Linear
correlation estimates, various meta-regression analyses controlling for confounders, contour plot simulation
and Monte Carlo permutation test (n=224, 1000 perm, joint P=0.01) statistics revealed that latitude has been
one of the most influential variables determining the magnitude and frequency by which C. difficile has been
found in the human diet. a) Moment-based estimate of between-food-set study variance and display of
weighed correlation between prevalence and the absolute latitude. Without Knapp & Hartung modification to
standard errors. P-values unadjusted and adjusted for multiple testing. Note that longitude is not significant
variable. b) Plot of linear trends derived from fitting linear models to actual data segregated by type of food
and continents/regions aligned over distinct longitude ranges. Notice that except one slope, published
reports have documented an inversed latitudinal trend. c) Contour line plot simulation of the weighed CD
prevalence for all food items over absolute latitude and real longitude plane (semi-transparent circles of
different sizes, the larger the circle, the greater the influence on overall simulation). d) Contour density and
line plot simulation to help visualize the low prevalence estimates (near zero=blue) and latitudinal trends.
Circles represent the location of the research centers were the studies were conducted or the centroid for the
region that was sampled. e) Contour density simulation to illustrate that latitudinal trends (arrows) can cover
different latitudinal ranges, depending on the region (e.g., short high arrow corresponds to Europe). In
iterative simulations, it is to note that such density latitudinal trends tend to cluster between two extreme
arrangement patterns but that the significance is independent of the region (Supplementary Figures 6-7 for
further details and statistics). Click to RETURN TO RESULTS SECTION
