Abstract
There are currently no therapies proven to promote early recovery of consciousness in
patients with severe brain injuries in the intensive care unit (ICU). Early recovery of
consciousness would benefit patients and families by reducing the likelihood of
premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and may decrease ICU complications
related to immobility, facilitate self-expression, enable autonomous decision-making,
and increase access to rehabilitative care. Here, we present the connectome-based
clinical trial platform (CCTP), a new mechanistic paradigm for developing and testing
targeted therapies that promote early recovery of consciousness in the ICU.

The

scientific premise of the CCTP is that personalized brain connectome maps can be
used to select patients for targeted therapies that promote recovery of consciousness.
Structural and functional MRI connectome maps will identify circuits that may be
amenable to neuromodulation. Patients will be selected for clinical trials in the CCTP
paradigm based on connectomes that are likely to respond to targeted therapies. To
demonstrate the utility of this precision approach, we describe STIMPACT (Stimulant
Therapy Targeted to Individualized Connectivity Maps to Promote ReACTivation of
Consciousness), a CCTP-based clinical trial in which intravenous methylphenidate will
be used to promote early recovery of consciousness in the ICU (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT03814356).

We propose that the CCTP has the potential to transform the

therapeutic landscape in the ICU and improve outcomes for patients with severe brain
injuries.

Introduction
For patients with severe brain injuries in the intensive care unit (ICU), the range of
possible outcomes includes death, a persistent disorder of consciousness (DoC),
recovery of consciousness with functional disability, and recovery of functional
independence [1]. Early recovery of consciousness in the ICU is a strong predictor of
long-term outcome [2-4] and a critical determinant of decisions to continue or withdraw
life-sustaining therapy [5].

However, there are currently no treatments proven to

promote early recovery of consciousness in the ICU.

Without knowing whether a

patient can recover consciousness, many families – guided by intensive care clinicians
– withdraw life-sustaining therapy, a decision that accounts for up to 70% of deaths in
ICU patients with severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) [6, 7] and over 40% of deaths in
patients with hypoxic-ischemic injury [8].

Furthermore, decisions to withdraw life-

sustaining therapy often occur in the first three days of hospitalization [6], when
prognosis is most uncertain.

A new treatment that promotes early recovery of

consciousness in the ICU would benefit patients and families by reducing the likelihood
of premature withdrawal of life-sustaining therapy and may decrease ICU complications
related to immobility, facilitate self-expression, enable autonomous decision-making,
and increase access to specialized rehabilitative care.
Two barriers currently prevent the development of consciousness-promoting
therapies in the ICU. First, patients are not rigorously classified prior to enrollment in
clinical trials.

Instead of selecting patients based on the precise pathophysiologic

mechanism underlying coma, trials enroll patients based on behavioral measures, such
as the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, that divide brain injuries into severity

categories.
condition.

This approach is ineffective because coma is a highly heterogeneous
Traumatic and hypoxic-ischemic coma, for example, are associated with

variable patterns of axonal disconnections within the subcortical ascending arousal
network (AAN), cortical default mode network (DMN), and other networks that contribute
to consciousness [9-14]. Without precision tools to map preserved network connections
in individual patients, it is not possible to identify patients whose connectomes are
amenable to therapeutic modulation.
Second, therapeutic responses are not routinely tested with direct measures of
brain function in early-phase clinical trials. Rather, early-phase trials rely on indirect
serologic markers of brain injury or insensitive, delayed measures of functional disability
[15, 16]. Without biomarkers that directly and quantitatively measure brain function,
fundamental questions about a therapy’s neurobiological effects are not being answered
in Phases 1 and 2 before moving to Phase 3 trials. Clearly, a new approach to clinical
trial design is of scientific and ethical import for this vulnerable population [5]. Indeed,
experts in civilian and military brain injury [15-17], including leaders at the National
Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke [18], are now calling for new approaches
to clinical trial design for comatose patients. This goal is also a central component of
the Curing Coma Campaign launched by the Neurocritical Care Society in 2019.
To address the call for clinical trial design innovation, we propose the
Connectome-based Clinical Trial Platform (CCTP), a new mechanistic paradigm for
developing and testing targeted therapies that promote early recovery of consciousness
in the ICU. The CCTP incorporates two innovations: 1) predictive biomarkers to enroll
patients in clinical trials based on connectomes that can be targeted by new therapies;

and 2) pharmacodynamic biomarkers to measure how targeted therapies modulate
networks, reactivate the cerebral cortex and restore consciousness.

By enrolling

patients in clinical trials based on a principled, mechanistic assessment of their
neuroanatomic potential for a therapeutic response, the CCTP will generate enhanced
study samples of patients with similar connectomes, thereby increasing treatment effect
sizes, decreasing sample sizes needed to power trials, and ultimately reducing trial
duration, cost and risk to subjects [16]. Most importantly, by enhancing the scientific
rigor of early-phase clinical trials, we hypothesize that the CCTP will improve the
success rate of late-phase trials so that investigators can bring new therapies to clinical
practice in the ICU. To demonstrate the utility of implementing the CCTP in the ICU, we
describe STIMPACT (Stimulant Therapy Targeted to Individualized Connectivity Maps
to Promote ReACTivation of Consciousness), a CCTP-based clinical trial in which
intravenous methylphenidate (IV MPH) will be used to promote recovery of
consciousness in severely brain-injured patients in the ICU (ClinicalTrials.gov
NCT03814356).

Methods
Conceptual and Empiric Basis for the CCTP
Current theories propose that consciousness requires the integrated function of multiple
brain networks, not any single node or connection [19, 20]. This network-based model
of consciousness is supported by histologic and radiologic data demonstrating that
coma can be caused by variable network disconnections [9, 10, 21-23], and that
consciousness requires dynamic network interactions [24]. For a patient to recover

consciousness, it is believed that the subcortical AAN, which modulates wakefulness
[25, 26], must reconnect with the DMN and other cortical networks, which mediate
awareness [13, 27]. However, the precise mechanisms underlying this reconnection
are poorly understood. Furthermore, it may be weeks, months, or even years before
these recovery mechanisms allow preserved AAN connections to reactivate the cerebral
cortex [28-30]. For patients whose families face time-sensitive, life-or-death decisions
in the ICU, treatments that promote recovery are needed within days. The CCTP will
accelerate recovery of consciousness via targeted therapeutic modulation of structurally
preserved brain network connections. The ultimate goal of the CCTP is to provide ICU
clinicians with an armamentarium of targeted therapies that promote recovery of
consciousness in patients with a broad range of coma etiologies.

Testing the CCTP – Patient and Target Selection for STIMPACT
STIMPACT will test the CCTP in patients with acute severe TBI who are being treated
in the ICU. We selected this patient population for our inaugural trial because prior
evidence suggests that components of the AAN may be spared, and therefore serve as
therapeutic targets, in patients with severe TBI. Histopathological studies show that
although the AAN is invariably injured in animals and humans with coma caused by
severe TBI [10, 31], not all AAN nuclei are lesioned and not all axons are disconnected.
For example, both histopathological and MRI studies reveal that the ventral midbrain,
home to the dopaminergic ventral tegmental area (VTA), often remains at least partially
intact after severe TBI [22, 32-34]. This phenomenon pertains not only to VTA neuronal
cell bodies in the midbrain, but also to VTA axons that connect with the diencephalon,

basal forebrain, and cortex (Figures 1, 2). Consistent with these observations, nuclear
imaging studies show that signal transmission in dopaminergic circuits is variably
altered by severe TBI [35-37].

These converging lines of evidence support the

hypothesis that preserved VTA connections are a potential target for therapeutic
modulation in ICU patients with severe TBI.

Testing the CCTP – Therapy Selection for STIMPACT
We selected IV MPH as the therapeutic agent for STIMPACT because of its wellestablished mechanism of action on the VTA, compelling rodent data suggesting its role
in promoting consciousness, and decades of data indicating its safe use in humans. IV
MPH is a dopamine reuptake inhibitor that potentiates dopaminergic neurotransmission
by VTA neurons [38, 39]. Although multiple neurotransmitters contribute to arousal [25],
empirical evidence strongly supports the role of dopamine in therapeutic modulation of
consciousness.
In rodent models of anesthetic coma, IV MPH promotes reemergence of
consciousness by stimulating dopaminergic VTA neuronal signaling via D1 receptors
[38, 40]. Furthermore, optogenetic [41] and electrical stimulation [40] of dopaminergic
VTA neurons promotes recovery of consciousness in anesthetized rodents. In humans,

including enteral MPH [42, 43]. Moreover, enteral amantadine, the only therapy shown
to promote recovery of consciousness in a randomized controlled trial of patients with
subacute TBI [44], increases dopamine release and blocks dopamine reuptake, thereby

increasing synaptic levels of dopamine. Most prior trials investigated enteral MPH,
which is FDA-approved to treat attention deficit disorder [39] and prescribed “off-label”
to promote recovery in patients with TBI [45, 46].

However, positron emission

tomography studies show that the IV formulation of MPH has a far more rapid uptake in
the human brain than does the enteral formulation (~10 minutes versus ~60 minutes)
[39]. Collectively, prior animal and human data provide a biological basis for using IV
MPH to upregulate structurally intact but functionally dormant dopaminergic VTA circuits
in ICU patients with severe TBI.

STIMPACT Hypothesis
The central hypothesis of the STIMPACT trial is that preservation of VTA connections
within the AAN connectome is a predictive biomarker of a response to IV MPH in
patients with acute severe TBI. We hypothesize that for the subset of patients with
preserved VTA connections, IV MPH will reconnect the cerebral cortex, accelerate
reemergence of consciousness, and transform the course of their recovery.

Predictive Biomarker for STIMPACT
To identify patients with preserved VTA connections, we will map the structural AAN
connectome on a clinical MRI scanner. We will use high angular resolution diffusion
imaging (HARDI) tractography, an MRI technique that maps axonal connectivity based
on directional water diffusion [47]. We have previously shown that HARDI tractography
methods can map the AAN connectome in the ex vivo human brain [26], detect acute
AAN disconnections ex vivo [10], and detect disruptions in vivo in ICU patients with

acute severe TBI [9].
Given that the VTA and cerebral cortex are connected both monosynaptically
and polysynaptically [26, 48] (Figure 3), it is unlikely that a single preserved VTA
connection will predict a patient’s response to IV MPH. Rather, we will use a graph
theoretical analysis measure, VTA hub strength (SVTA), as a predictive biomarker for the
STIMPACT trial, because this biomarker measures both direct (monosynaptic) and
indirect (polysynaptic) VTA connections. We selected subcortical AAN and cortical
DMN nodes as targets in the SVTA measurement because functional connectivity studies
suggest that DMN reactivation is essential for recovery of consciousness after severe
brain injury [12, 49-52] and that the VTA activates the DMN via the AAN [53].

Pharmacodynamic Biomarkers for STIMPACT
To measure the pharmacodynamic effects of IV MPH, we will map the AAN’s functional
connectome with a multimodal approach that integrates resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) and EEG. First, we will use blood-oxygen-level dependent (BOLD) rs-fMRI to
generate Fisher Z-normalized measurements of VTA-DMN functional connectivity (ZVTADMN).

We and others have demonstrated the feasibility of rs-fMRI mapping of functional

brain networks in ICU patients with acute severe TBI (Figure 3) [12, 50, 51], and in a
preliminary analysis we observed that ZVTA-DMN increases as patients recover
consciousness (Figure 4). Given that brainstem functional network mapping requires
high spatial and temporal resolution, we implemented a simultaneous multislice [54]
BOLD sequence on the 3 Tesla Siemens Skyra MRI scanner in the Massachusetts
General Hospital Neurosciences ICU (2 mm isotropic voxels, TR=1.25 seconds; see

Supplementary Material for additional sequence parameters). To control for the effects
of physiological fluctuations on the BOLD signal [55], we measure and statistically
regress cardiac and respiratory activity during rs-fMRI (Figure 5 and Supplementary
Figures 1 and 2).

Details regarding physiologic data acquisition and analysis are

provided in the Supplementary Methods.
Second, we will use resting-state EEG data to identify a quantitative EEG
biomarker that measures the effect of IV MPH on cortical circuit function. Crucial to this
effort is the development of statistical methods that quantify EEG oscillatory dynamics.
Patients with DoC experience frequent fluctuations in arousal [56], and the dynamic
range and robustness of EEG biomarkers during these fluctuations in the ICU
environment is unknown. Therefore, we will acquire 24 hours of baseline EEG data for
each patient prior to the first IV MPH dose, allowing therapeutic responses to be
compared to each patient’s baseline biomarker variance.
Candidate EEG biomarkers include quantitative measures from spectral [57],
graph theoretical [58], complexity [59], and entropy [60] analyses. Efforts to compare
the diagnostic utility of these biomarkers are underway in animals [61], patients with
chronic DoC [62], and ICU patients with acute DoC [63-65]. Recent studies of patients
with chronic DoC suggest that spectral measures perform well in comparison to other
EEG-based cortical measures [62], and our preliminary results suggest that patients
experience wide-ranging fluctuations in frequency band-specific activity over the course
of a clinical recording (Figure 6).

Nevertheless, the ratio of alpha to delta power

appears to reliably distinguish patients with DoC from patients who have recovered

consciousness. Ongoing efforts are underway to determine which EEG biomarkers are
most responsive to therapeutic stimulation in patients with acute DoC.

Safety Considerations and Rationale for a Phase 1 Trial
No serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in the 1,700 humans who received IV
MPH between 1958 and 2010. Common drug-related side effects include hypertension,
tachycardia, agitation, and nausea [66], which are readily manageable in the ICU
environment of the STIMPACT trial. However, IV MPH has never been administered to
a patient with acute severe TBI, and experience with IV MPH in comatose humans is
limited to small case series of patients with barbiturate overdoses [67-69]. Thus, we
believe that it is scientifically and ethically appropriate to begin STIMPACT with a Phase
1 safety study.
Notably, there is a hypothetical risk that early stimulant therapy in the ICU could
harm patients by exacerbating glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity in the traumatized
brain. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no evidence from animal or human studies to
substantiate this risk. Rather, evidence from a rat neuronal culture study suggests that
dopamine may be protective against excitotoxicity [70] and we recently found that
enteral stimulants, including MPH, were well tolerated with no SAEs in 48 ICU patients
[45].

Overview of STIMPACT Phase 1 Study Design
In Phase 1 of STIMPACT, we aim to enroll 22 adult patients with acute traumatic DoC
regardless of SVTA magnitude. Inclusion and exclusion criteria are described on

clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03814356).

Because patients with acute severe TBI have

increased hepatic drug metabolism and clearance, we cannot rely on prior dose-finding
and pharmacokinetic studies of healthy humans [39, 66] and must determine the
maximum tolerated dose and pharmacokinetics of IV MPH in our population of interest.
Thus, our primary endpoint is the number of drug-related SAEs occurring at each of
three IV MPH doses: 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 mg/kg. Our secondary endpoint is the effect of IV
MPH on ZVTA-DMN and the alpha-delta ratio. These rs-fMRI and EEG metrics will provide
a direct pharmacodynamic assessment of IV MPH on its target brain network.
Each patient will undergo 5 days of data acquisition, with predictive biomarker
data and baseline pharmacodynamic biomarker data collected on Day 0, and treatmentrelated biomarker data collected on Days 1-4 (Figure 7). Hence, each patient’s
biomarker responses to IV MPH will be measured against individual baseline biomarker
variance – this will help account for each patient’s current drug regimen, which will be
determined by clinical need. IV MPH will be administered as daily boluses (via IV push
at a rate not to exceed 20 mg/min) on Days 1-4: 0.5 mg/kg on Day 1, 1.0 mg/kg on Day
2, 2.0 mg/kg on Day 3, and the maximum tolerated dose on Day 4. On Days 1-3, we will
record EEG continuously to measure alpha-delta ratio before and after each dose. On
Day 4, each patient will receive his/her maximum tolerated dose during an rs-fMRI scan
to measure ZVTA-DMN prior to and after IV MPH.
While broader than the 0.5 to 0.9 mg/kg dose range used in most prior human
studies [39, 66], the range of 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg may still be insufficient to detect a
pharmacodynamic response in patients with severe TBI. Therefore, we require a
pharmacodynamic response in ≥10% of patients in Phase 1 to proceed to Phase 2, a

double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over trial which will test the hypothesis that
preserved SVTA predicts a pharmacodynamic biomarker response to IV MPH relative to
placebo. Without such a response, we will repeat Phase 1 at a higher dose range. A
detailed statistical analysis plan for the STIMPACT Phase 1 trial is provided in the
Supplementary Material.
In July 2018, we convened a Clinical Oversight Committee, led by an
experienced Independent Medical Monitor (Dr. Thomas P. Bleck), which approved our
approach to conducting the STIMPACT trial.

To ensure that the TBI community’s

interests are represented, we also convened a Patient and Family Advisory Board,
which reviewed the research plan and made recommendations regarding recruitment,
study activities, and dissemination. The investigational new drug (IND) application was
approved by the FDA in August, 2018 (IND# 140675), and the trial protocol was
approved by the Partners Healthcare Institutional Review Board in May, 2019.

Summary
We propose a mechanistic clinical trial paradigm, the Connectome-based Clinical Trial
Platform (CCTP), to predict and measure responses to new therapies in the ICU. We
also describe a CCTP-based trial, STIMPACT, which will test the hypothesis that IV
MPH promotes recovery of consciousness in patients who have preserved VTA
connections within their AAN connectomes. The CCTP will allow clinicians to provide
targeted treatments that are personalized to each patient’s connectome, ensuring that
each patient is given the best possible chance to recover consciousness in the ICU.
Ultimately, we envision multidisciplinary discussions about optimal treatment selection

at a Coma Board, akin to the Tumor Board at which therapeutic decisions are made by
a multidisciplinary team for patients with cancer. By providing a clinical trial platform to
test targeted pharmacologic and electrophysiologic therapies that reactivate the injured
human connectome, the CCTP has the potential to transform the therapeutic landscape
and improve outcomes for patients with coma.

Figure Legends:
Figure 1: Personalized Connectome Mapping in the ICU Reveals Preserved
Ventral Tegmental Area Connections.
VTA tracts are shown from a left lateral view in a 33-year-old healthy male control and a
29-year-old man with acute severe TBI. The patient was comatose on arrival to the
hospital and in a minimally conscious state at the time of this scan on post-injury day 7,
as determined by a Coma Recovery Scale-Revised assessment. Tractography analysis
was performed using TrackVis, as previously described [26]. All tracts are color-coded
by sites of VTA connectivity: turquoise with dorsal raphe (DR), blue with locus coeruleus
(LC), green with median raphe (MR), and pink with cortex, thalamus (Th), hypothalamus
(Hy), or basal forebrain (BF). Multiple VTA connections are preserved in the patient,
including with the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC), which is a node of the default mode
network. The patient recovered consciousness and functional independence by 6
months. Even in a patient with acute severe traumatic brain injury, the VTA may be a
hub through which multiple brainstem AAN nodes connect with the Th, Hy and cerebral
cortex.

Figure 2: VTA Axonal Connections are Spared in a Subset of Patients.
We analyzed VTA connectivity with the hypothalamus (Hy), thalamus (Th), and basal
forebrain (BF) in 16 patients, as well as in 16 matched controls. We calculated a
connectivity probability (CP) between the VTA and each target AAN node using
previously described methods [47, 71]. On a group level, median CP values were lower
between the VTA and each AAN node in patients compared with controls. However,

there is significant variance in control-group CP values, and many patients fall within the
control-group interquartile range (IQR). These results indicate relative sparing of VTA
connections in a subset of patients with acute severe TBI. See the Supplementary
Materials for a detailed description of the CP calculation algorithm.

Line thickness is

proportional to the connectivity probability (CP; see Supplementary Materials for how
this value is measured) for each node-node pair. Nodal grey shading is proportional to
the percentage of each node occupied by a traumatic lesion (bottom right bar). These

VTA and default mode network (DMN), are used to calculate SVTA. Connectogram

Figure 4: Functional Connectivity between the Ventral Tegmental Area and
Default Mode Network Reemerges During Recovery.
Eight patients with acute severe TBI underwent rs-fMRI in the ICU and at six-month
follow-up, by which time all had recovered consciousness. Mean group-level VTA
functional connectivity maps are shown, based on Fisher Z-transformed correlations in
the BOLD signal (color bar). There were no VTA-DMN connections acutely, but VTA
connections with the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) node of the DMN reemerged
during recovery of consciousness (red arrow). The statistical threshold used here is
more liberal than in our recent studies of DMN connectivity [12, 50], which underscores
the need for the higher-resolution rs-fMRI sequence that we developed for the CCTP.

Subject and a Representative Patient.
Time series of respiratory variation and change in blood-oxygen level dependent
(ΔBOLD) signal in the left ventral diencephalon are shown in the left column. The

dynamic interaction between respiratory variation and ΔBOLD is demonstrated by the
squared wavelet coherence map between the time series of respiratory variation and
ΔBOLD shown in the middle column. The magnitude of coherence ranges between 0
and 1, where warmer color represents stronger coherence and cooler color represents
weaker coherence. Significant coherence between respiratory variation and ΔBOLD
occurs in the area defined by the thick contour of the unfaded region. The x-coordinate
of the area provides information on the duration of the oscillating cycle when respiratory
variation interacts with ΔBOLD, and the y-coordinate shows the time when this
interaction occurs over the resting state fMRI scan. The simplified format of coherence
between respiratory variation and ΔBOLD is shown in the right column, with the features
of oscillations displayed in terms of frequency. While increased coherence is found
between respiratory variation and ΔBOLD at the frequency range of 0.008-0.063Hz in
the healthy subject, the coherence between respiratory variation and ΔBOLD in the
same frequency range is diminished in the patient with acute severe TBI. Compared
with the healthy subject, the resting state BOLD signal changes have less influence
from respiratory variation in the patient with acute severe TBI. A detailed interpretation
of the wavelet coherence findings is included in Supplementary Materials.

Figure 6: Alpha-delta Ratio as a Biomarker of Recovery of Consciousness.
We computed the dynamic range of the resting-state alpha-delta ratio in EEG
recordings of patients with severe traumatic brain injury and controls. The plots show
comparisons of alpha-delta ratio measures in 12 ICU patients with acute severe
traumatic brain injury (left), these same 12 patients at 6-month follow-up (middle), and

16 healthy controls (right). Each column represents a single subject. The three red lines
within each subject’s alpha-delta ratio plot represent the interquartile range (outer red
lines) and the median (middle red line). These results suggest that 1) alpha-delta ratio
is generally lower in unconscious ICU patients (coma and vegetative state) than in
conscious ICU patients (minimally conscious state and post-traumatic confusional
state); 2) in ICU patients who recover consciousness by 6 months, alpha-delta ratio
typically increases to values similar to those of controls; and 3) there is substantial intrasubject variance in alpha-delta ratio during a single EEG recording.

Figure 7: STIMPACT Study Design Schematic.
Each patient in Phase 1 of the STIMPACT Trial will undergo five days of data
acquisition, with predictive biomarker data and baseline pharmacodynamic biomarker
data collected on Day 0, and treatment-related biomarker data collected on Days 1-4.
Hence, each patient’s biomarker responses to IV MPH will be measured against his/her
own baseline biomarker variance. Abbreviations: BP = blood pressure; CRS-R = Coma
