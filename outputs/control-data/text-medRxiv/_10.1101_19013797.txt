ABSTRACT
Purpose
Solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients can develop skeletal diseases caused by underlying conditions and the use of
immunosuppressants. As a result, SOT recipients are at risk for decreased bone mineral density (BMD) and
increased fracture incidences. We propose a network meta-analysis (NMA) that incorporates all available RCT data
to provide the most comprehensive ranking of antiresorptive interventions according to their ability to decrease
fracture incidences and increase BMD in SOT recipients.
Methods
We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, CENTRAL and Chinese literature sources for
RCTs, and we will include adult SOT recipients who took antiresorptive therapies starting at the time of transplant
with relevant outcomes. We will perform title and full-text screening as well as data extraction in duplicate. We will
report changes in BMD as weighted or standardized mean differences, and fracture incidences as risk ratios. We will
use SUCRA scores to provide rankings of interventions, and we will examine the quality of evidence using risk of
bias and CINeMA.
Results
The results of this systematic review and network meta-analysis will be published in a peer-reviewed journal.
Conclusions
To our knowledge, this systematic review and network meta-analysis will be the most comprehensive quantitative
analysis regarding the management of bone loss and fractures in SOT recipients. Our analysis should be able to
provide physicians and patients with an up-to-date recommendation for pharmacotherapies in reducing incidences of
bone loss and fractures associated with SOT.

MINI ABSTRACT
We propose a network meta-analysis investigating the use of antiresorptive interventions to prevent bone loss and
fractures in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. We aim to provide a comprehensive ranking of antiresorptive
therapies in terms of their ability to increase bone mineral density and decrease fracture incidence in SOT recipients.

INTRODUCTION
Solid organ transplantation (SOT) has become the standard of care for patients suffering from end-stage organ
failure or organ insufficiencies in recent years. According to the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS), there
are over 110,000 patients awaiting life-saving organ transplants in the US, with over 36,000 solid-organ transplant
surgeries performed in 2018[1]. These numbers are expected to increase significantly in the near future, with
worrying public health trends — such as the continuously increasing rate of cardiac failures worldwide — showing
no signs of slowing down[2].
With the increasing number of transplant recipients and improvements in survival rates as a result of advancements
in surgical techniques, perioperative care, and immunosuppressive therapies, improving patient’s postoperative
recovery and long term survival has become ever more important. SOT patients would face many morbidity risks as
a result of transplant-related consequences. The risk of osteoporosis for SOT patients, for example, has been
demonstrated to be five times greater than that of the general population[3]. This may be caused by several factors,
the most prevalent ones being progressive chronic disease before transplant, consequences of lifelong
immunosuppression, and malnutrition[3].
There are several possible mechanisms for osteoporosis and bone loss after SOT. The majority of bone loss occur in
the 6-12 months postoperative period, with a significant increase in fracture risks[4]. However, the risks of
osteoporosis increase in some SOT recipient populations before the transplant. Abnormal bone formation and
resorption markers are widely observed in liver transplant candidates, while altered bone metabolism is associated
with hormonal abnormalities in chronic kidney disease patients[4]. In heart and lung transplant candidates, the
pathophysiology and pharmacotherapies for diseases such as congestive heart failure and cystic fibrosis are also
associated with an increased risk for osteoporosis pre-transplant[3, 4]. After transplant, lifelong immunosuppression
is a major factor in transplant related osteoporosis. Glucocorticoids, a common immunosuppressant agent for SOT
patients, activates the RANKL system which decreases bone formation and accelerate bone resorption[4]. The
introduction of cyclosporine A and other calcineurin inhibitors significantly increased allograft survival and
decreased organ rejection in SOT recipients; however, their effects and mechanisms on osteoporosis is still not well
understood, showing inconsistent results on decreasing bone mineral density (BMD). In comparison, mammalian
target of rapamycin inhibitors (mTORi) such as sirolimus and tacrolimus demonstrated an inhibition of osteoclast
formation, which may promote bone growth in post-transplant patients[4, 5].
Because SOT patients are at such high risk for bone loss after transplant, osteoporosis management is very important
in this population. There are several treatment options available. Calcium and vitamin D supplementation is
recommended for all SOT patients even before the transplant as 91% of the patients have vitamin D insufficiencies
across all end stage organ failures[6]. Beside its graft-protective effects, vitamin D improves intestinal calcium
absorption, prevent hyperparathyroidism and promote osteoblast formation[3]. In addition, the effectiveness of
calcitonin as an adjuvant to calcium and vitamin D has been demonstrated in renal and cardiac transplants[3].
Bisphosphonates have also been proven as robust antiresorptive agents. They maintain BMD in post-transplant
patients by mediating osteoclast-related bone resorption[4] and some long term studies have demonstrated that they
decrease fracture risks in SOT patients[3].
Despite the vast amount of clinical trial evidence available which supports the use of different antiresorptive drugs
in transplant patients, no systematic review to date has incorporated all available randomized controlled trial (RCT)
data to determine the optimal antiresorptive intervention for SOT recipients. A previous meta-analysis compared the
efficacy of bisphosphonates and vitamin D analogs in increasing BMD and decreasing fracture incidences in SOT
patients, however they were limited by the pairwise meta-analysis design and thus was not able to investigate the
efficacy of different bisphosphonates or vitamin D analogs. In addition, they were not able to incorporate RCT data
on other antiresorptive interventions, such as calcitonin[7].

Network meta-analyses (NMAs) allow the comparison and ranking of all studied interventions at once as opposed to
regular meta-analyses[8]. Therefore, only a NMA can utilize all available RCT data for a given patient population.
We propose to conduct a systematic review and NMA of RCTs to investigate the following research questions:
What are the comparative effects (in terms of fracture incidences and changes in BMD from baseline) of different
antiresorptive interventions on adult SOT recipients?

METHODS AND ANALYSIS
We will conduct this systematic review and NMA in accordance to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) incorporating NMA of health care interventions[9]. This study is
prospectively registered on The International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO) —
CRD42019138807. Any significant amendments to this protocol will be reported and published with the results of
the review.
Eligibility Criteria
Types of Participants
We will include adult (18 years or older) SOT recipients who had received antiresorptive interventions starting at the
time of transplantation. SOT is defined according to The Washington Manual of Medical Therapeutics, 34th ed., as
transplantation of the kidney, liver, pancreas, heart, and lung[10].
Types of Studies
We will include parallel-groups RCTs. If a RCT uses a crossover design, latest data from before the first crossover
will be used.
Types of Interventions
We will include any antiresorptive pharmacotherapies used to manage bone loss and fractures. This may include
(but not limited to) bisphosphonates (e.g. alendronate, risedronate, zoledronic acid), calcitonin, calcium, vitamin D
or D analogs (e.g. calcitriol or alfacalcidol). If data permits, placebo and untreated (i.e. no antiresorptive treatment)
will also be included as treatment arms. We will include combinations of multiple antiresorptive therapies.
Primary Outcomes
Fracture Incidence
We will evaluate fracture incidences based on data collected at the latest follow-up. If data permits, we will conduct
separate analyses for vertebral and nonvertebral fractures. Definitions of fractures will be defined as per individual
study criteria.
Change in BMD
We will evaluate change in BMD from baseline, in both percentage and absolute change. BMD change must be
calculated based on BMD data collected at the latest follow-up.
We will analyze BMD readings taken at the lumbar spine and femoral neck. Absolute and percentage changes in Tscore and Z-score will not be included in this analysis.

Electronic Database Search
We will conduct a librarian-assisted search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Science, CINAHL, and CENTRAL
from inception to January 2020. We will use Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms to ensure broad and
appropriate inclusions of titles and abstracts. See Supplementary Material S1 for the sample MEDLINE search
strategy.
Major Chinese databases, including Wanfang Data, Wanfang Med Online, CNKI, and CQVIP will also be searched
using a custom Chinese search strategy. See Supplementary Material S2 for the sample CNKI search strategy.
Other Data Sources
We will hand search the reference list of previous systematic reviews for relevant articles. We will also review
clinicaltrials.gov for registered published or unpublished studies.
Data Collection and Analysis
Study Selection
We will perform title and abstract screening independently and in duplicate using Rayyan QCRI
(https://rayyan.qcri.org/). Studies will only be selected for full-text screening if both reviewers deem the study
relevant. Full-text screening will also be conducted in duplicate. We will resolve any conflicts via discussion and
consensus or by recruiting a third author for arbitration.
Data Collection
We will carry out data collection independently and in duplicate using data extraction sheets developed a priori. We
will resolve discrepancies by recruiting a third author to review the data.
Risk of Bias
We will assess risk of bias (RoB) independently and in duplicate using The Cochrane Collaboration’s tool for
assessing risk of bias in randomized trials[11]. Two reviewers will assess biases within each article in seven
domains: random sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of
outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other sources of bias. We have prospectively
defined the RoB domains in Table 1. The overall risk of bias will be the average risk across all domains.

Final BMD measurements or percentage/absolute change in BMD from baseline, # vertebral fracture incidences at
latest follow-up, # non-vertebral fracture incidences at latest follow-up.
Other Data
Adverse events, description of anti-diabetic and antiresorptive therapy (i.e. dosage, duration), mean follow-up.
Statistical Analysis
Network Meta-Analysis
We will conduct all statistical analyses using R 3.5.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). We
will perform Bayesian NMAs using the gemtc library[8]. Because we expect heterogeneity among studies due to
differences in patient characteristics and study methodologies, we will use a random effects model[8]. We will use
patients receiving no active antiresorptive interventions, including patients using placebo, as a reference for
comparison.
For changes in BMD, we will report the results of the analysis as mean differences (MDs) with 95% credible
intervals (CrIs) if all included studies utilized the same scale (e.g. if BMD changes are all reported as percentage
changes). Otherwise, we will report these outcomes as standardized mean differences (SMDs) to include all
available RCT data. We will calculate SMD by dividing the mean differences between treatment groups by the
weighted pooled standard deviation (SD) using Hedges’ method[12]. Because SMDs are difficult to interpret for
most clinicians, we will supplement our SMD results with MDs as well, considering only percentage changes in
BMD. Fracture incidences will be reported as risk ratios with corresponding 95% CrIs. For studies with no fracture
events, we will assign a continuity correction of 0.5[13], and we will perform sensitivity analyses to examine the
effect of continuity correction factors on treatment rankings (see Supplementary Material S3). We will run all
network models for a minimum of 100,000 iterations to ensure convergence.
If there are outcomes for which we did not gather enough information to perform a NMA, we will provide a
qualitative description of the available data and study outcomes.
Treatment Ranking
We will use the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) scores to provide an estimate as to the
ranking of treatments. SUCRA scores range from 0 to 1, with higher SUCRA scores indicating more efficacious
treatment arms[14].
Missing Data
We will attempt to contact the authors of the original studies to obtain missing or unpublished data. Missing
standard deviation values will be imputed using methods described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic
Reviews of Interventions[15] using correlation coefficients (see Supplementary Material S4). We will perform a
sensitivity analysis with different correlation coefficients to examine the effects of the coefficients on treatment
rankings (see Supplementary Material S3), and we will comment on the consistency of coefficients across
different treatments.
Heterogeneity Assessment
We will assess statistical heterogeneity within each outcome network using I2 statistics and the Cochran’s Q test[16].
We will consider an I2 index ≥ 50% as an indication for serious heterogeneity, and I2 index > 75% as an
indication for very serious heterogeneity. We will explore potential sources of heterogeneity using meta-regression
analyses and subgroup analyses (see Supplementary Material S5).

Inconsistency
We will assess inconsistency using the node-splitting method[17]. We will explore any indications of significant
inconsistency using meta-regression analyses and subgroup analyses (see Supplementary Material S5).
Publication Bias
To assess small-study effects within the networks, we will use a comparison-adjusted funnel plot[18]. Treatment
arms need to be ordered in a meaningful fashion prior to plotting the funnel plot according to assumptions of how
small studies differ from larger studies. We will sort our treatment arms according to their SUCRA values with the
assumption that small trials tend to favour more efficacious interventions. We will use Egger’s regression test to
check for asymmetry within the funnel plot to identify possible publication bias[19].
Quality of Evidence
We will use the Confidence in Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) web application (Institute of Social and
Preventive Medicine, University of Bern, Bern, Switzerland) to evaluate confidence in the findings from our NMA.
CINeMA adheres to the GRADE approach for evaluating the quality of evidence by assessing network quality based
on six criteria: within-study bias, across-study bias, indirectness, imprecision, heterogeneity and incoherence[20].
We will report the results of our GRADE analysis using a summary of findings table.
DISCUSSION
The previous meta-analysis regarding the use of antiresorptive medications in SOT recipients were limited by their
pairwise designs. As a result, the latest analysis did not include all available RCT data[7]. Our study aims to
significantly expand upon the latest meta-analysis by incorporating the entirety of global RCT evidence available.
To our knowledge, our proposed study will be the most comprehensive review to evaluate the relative effects of
multiple antiresorptive agents among SOT patients using a NMA approach with multi-language search strategies.
Our review will have several strengths. First, we will extend our database search to Chinese databases for our
analysis. Because of China’s immense patient population and regulations that promote pharmaceutical research, the
inclusion of Chinese RCTs will help strengthen the power and precision of our analyses. Furthermore, we will use
NMA techniques to analyze RCTs concerning antiresorptive pharmacotherapies. This strategy will allow us to
include different bisphosphonates and vitamin D analogs as separate treatment arms, while including other
interventions such as calcitonin. Lastly, we will only include RCT data, and we will use tools such as The Cochrane
Collaboration’s tool for assessing risk of bias in randomized trials, CINeMA, and comparison-adjusted funnel plots
to evaluate the quality of our included studies and networks. We will further use meta-regression and subgroup
analyses to explore any observed heterogeneity and inconsistency, as well as using sensitivity analyses to examine
the robustness of our methodology.
One major limitation of our proposed study is that Chinese clinicians may adopt different practices as Western
clinicians (e.g. higher drug dosages); as a result, outcomes from Chinese RCTs may not be applicable to the Western
healthcare system.
Despite this limitation, our NMA will likely be the largest quantitative synthesis assessing antiresorptive therapies
among SOT recipients to date. Our study should help physicians with selecting antiresorptive regimens that are the
most beneficial for the bone health of SOT recipients. Our study may also highlight promising treatment strategies
that were not discussed in previous analyses, providing physicians and researchers with future research directions.
