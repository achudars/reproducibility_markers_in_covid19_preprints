Abstract

Background: A high socioeconomic status (SES) was considered as an established risk

factor for melanoma in western countries and areas, the same was not true in China.

There have been few studies on SES of Chinese melanoma patients. The purpose of this

study was to evaluate the association of SES in Chinese melanoma patients.

Methods: We performed a cross-sectional study using the data from Ministry of Human

Resources

Fudan University between January 2013 to December 2017. 58 (48%) were male and 64

(52%) were female, the mean age was 59.23±9.91 years and median age was 60.5 years.

Patients in 45-59 age group and 60-73 age group tend to have higher cancer incidence

compared with other age groups. The acral lentiginous melanoma (48%) was the most

common subtype. Patients with low education level (middle school and below) and low

melanoma. Similar results were indicated for the patients who were unemployed. There

were remarkable more patients who had medical insurance diagnosed with melanoma in

this study. There was no significant difference on melanoma stage for patients with higher

compared to lower education level (p=0.153). For monthly household income, the Fish’s

exact test indicated no significant difference in melanoma stage with p=0.507. No staging

difference was observed between unemployed patients and employed patients (p=0.687).

Finally, statistically significant differences in melanoma staging were not indicated by a

patient’s insurance status (p=0.537).

Conclusions: For patients enrolled in our study, disadvantaged SES did not substantially

lead to an increasing risk of melanoma incidence, and the effect of socioeconomic factors

seemed uninfluenced the stage of melanoma.

Melanoma rates have risen dramatically all over the world in the last 15 years, with steady

increases seen in cases of invasive melanoma with higher morbidity and mortality rates(1).

In China Melanoma represents a small proportion of tumors, it is nevertheless one of the

main cancers with high mortality(2). Melanoma has also been one of the most rapidly

increasing cancers in China(3).

According to reports based on western data, melanoma has consistently been shown to

occur

frequently

in

groups

of

high

socioeconomic

status

(SES)(4-7).

For

example,

analysis of the United States data demonstrated higher incidence rates of melanoma in

counties with high richness rates, high education level, high median household income

and high employment rates(8). This association has mainly been attributed to high-risk

behavioral

patterns

of

excessive

sun

exposure,

as

patients

with

higher

income

and

education levels have more opportunity for recreational sunlight(9, 10). However, in China,

the most common pathological subtype of melanoma, differed substantially from those

reported in western populations, is the acral lentiginous which does not appear to be

related to

sun

exposure(11).

Meanwhile, the rarity

of

melanoma

in China precludes

in-depth and intensive economic and social studies of this disease. There have been few

studies on SES statues of melanoma patients in China. Thus, to date, the impact of SES

among Chinese melanoma patients is not well defined. To bridge the gaps of extant

literatures, this study aimed to retrospectively analysis the SES of melanoma patients

documented in our institution, to explore the association between SES and melanoma in

China through a representative sample.

Patients and Methods

Patients

This study was conducted at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, which is a tertiary

hospital and a budget management unit under the China National Health and Family

Planning Commission. This hospital has a wide national coverage, thus its patients we

included could be regarded as a good sample representing a national situation. This study

adhered to the guidelines set of the declaration of Helsinki, and was approved by the

institutional review board of Zhongshan Hospital. All patients provide informed written

consents.

We studied a cohort of patients who presented to Zhongshan hospital with diagnosis of

melanoma, first and primary, over a period of 5 years between January 2013 to December

2017. Patients with unclear medical records and incomplete socioeconomic information

were excluded. Patients who had undergone diagnosis or therapy in other facility centers

were also excluded due to the difficulties in retrieving information.

Patients’ demographics including ID number (which contains the date of birth), gender

and age were obtained at time of enrollment. Age was categorized into five groups:

younger than 30 years, 30-44 years, 45-59 years, 60-74 years, and 75 years or older

according to a national wide research of China(12).

SES were estimated using data from Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security of

the

People’s

Republic

of

China

(MOHRSS)

and

National

Healthcare

Security

Administration (NHSA). Sociodemographic data included education, ethnicity, and phone

number. Economic data included household income per capita, occupation, and medical

insurance. Date of pathologic diagnosis was defined as the biopsy date of the primary

tumor and was used to calculate each patient’s age at melanoma diagnosis.

Patients’ tumor characteristics were obtained from hospital information system (HIS) of

Zhongshan hospital. The histological subtypes and the clinical stage at diagnosis were

categorized according to Guidelines of Chinese Society Oncology (CSCO), Melanoma

(2017. V1). Tumors were grouped into five histological subtypes: superficial spreading

malignant melanoma (SSM), lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM), nodular melanoma (NM),

acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM) and others (mucosal, unclassified and unknow).

SES variables

Variables of SES for analyses included social and economic characteristics as recorded

at

time

of

diagnosis.

We

categorized

SES

variables

according

to

previous

Chinese

researches. The educational status was categorized into two groups: middle school and

below; high school and above(13). Monthly household income was categorized into two

levels: <3000 CNY (approximate 430 USD); ≥3000 CNY(14). In this cohort, there was no

patient whose occupation was professor or semi-professor, thus occupational status was

categorized into two levels: unemployed and employed(15). Medical insurance status was

coded as insured or uninsured. The Han ethnic group is the dominant one in China,

accounting for approximate 90% over the whole nation population. Therefore, the ethnicity

was binarily categorized Han and other groups. We defined that combination with high

social and high economic status as high SES.

(46%) diagnosed with stage II cancer, vs stage III (28%), stage I (25%) and stage IV (2%).

We found that the ALM (48%) was the most common subtype, followed by SSM (16%)

and other subtypes (16%). NM (12%) and LMM (7%) histological types were relatively

rare compared to ALM. Patients with low education level (middle school and below) and

Discussion

In general, melanoma has been shown to occur more frequently in Caucasian populations

with an incidence rate of 29.4 per 100,000(1). In contrast, the incidence rates in China

was 0.8 per 100,000(12), which represents a decreased incidence of at least 30 times

on western researches, melanoma represented an area of interplay amongst ethnicity,

socioeconomic factors, and incidence of disease. Specifically, melanoma has consistently

observe the evidence of association between SES factors and melanoma in China. Thus,

stage of melanoma in China

SES is a multidimensional concept and most contemporary researchers agree that it is

represented by a combination of family income, education and occupational status(17). In

this study, SES variables for analyses included educational level, monthly household

income, occupational status and medical insurance status.

disadvantaged in terms of education status had an increased risk of a diagnosis with

advanced-staged melanoma(23). However, an United States study demonstrated higher

incidence rates of melanoma in counties may associated with higher richness rates,

higher education level, higher median household income and higher employment rates(8).

This result could be explained by the fact that patients with higher education levels have

more opportunity for sunlight(10). Our study indicated that lower education level was

melanoma staging. We believe that our result will be an important finding in melanoma

research because, regardless the education level, Chinese always appreciate fair skin, we

like to get away from sunlight so that we will not get tanned. This may explain the

association between education level and melanoma epidemiology in our research.

In this study, the lower income status, unlike western results[18, 19], did not associate

with the advanced stage of melanoma. The western results may be explained by the fact

that patients with lower income could be affected by lack of resources, delayed detection,

poorer quality of care, and fewer treatment options. In China, we did not have the clinical

advance of melanoma treatment till 2018 when PD-1 blockage was approved by the

China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA)(24). Before that the burden of melanoma

treatment was not loaded due to the lack of targeted and immuno treatments. This limited

treatment option led to a poor prognosis, meanwhile, minimized the effect of income.

Patients did not need to pay too much for treatment.

While unemployment has been shown to be associated with a decreased relative risk of

melanoma in western research(25), our study found that unemployed patients had higher

epidemiological outcomes.

Overall, unlike western results, analysis of our data demonstrated that lower SES status

was not associated with an increased incidence in a statistically significant amount for all

stages of melanoma.

In a rapid developing country, a longer period would inevitably be accompanied rapid

advances in economic and society, this heterogeneity may lead to bias. Therefore, we

retrospectively analyzed patients present to our hospital and diagnosed as melanoma

between January 2013 and December 2017. In this 5-year period, we can establish a

relatively large sample and minimize the socioeconomic disparities due to time variations.

This study is not without limitations. A limitation in our result is that the MOHRSS and

MHSA do not collect medical history and cancer specific survival, thus we did not explore

the associate between SES and survival. Additionally, whereas this study enrolled 122

patients, a relatively large cohort in China, it was not population based. Further national

wide studies should investigate.

Conclusion

The results of the present study partially support our hypotheses, suggesting that there

was no significant association among high SES, melanoma incidence and stage. Patients

who were socially disadvantaged in terms of education, income, occupation or insurance
