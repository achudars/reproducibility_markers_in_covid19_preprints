Abstract
Background
In West Africa HIV prevalence varies between 0.1-6% in female and between 0.1-4% in the
male general population. Male circumcision is almost universal, and it is unclear what drives
this variation. We use mathematical modelling to identify the determinants of this variation
across fourteen West African countries.
Methods
We developed a novel dynamic model of HIV transmission between population cohorts of
female sex workers (FSWs), their clients, females with 2+ partners in the past year and other
sexually active women and men in the general population. Parameter ranges were determined
from the literature and sampled using Latin Hypercube sampling to identify parameter sets
that fit West African HIV prevalence data. Partial-rank correlation coefficients between
different model parameters and the HIV prevalence in general male and female population
across 14 countries were calculated to determine to most significantly correlated model
parameters to HIV prevalence.
Results
The key determinant of HIV in females when prevalence is between 0-3% is the size of the
brothel and non-brothel FSW groups. When female HIV prevalence >3%, the percentage of
sexually active adolescent females with 2+ partners has greater influence on HIV prevalence.
The size of the FSW groups has the most significant impact on HIV prevalence for males.
Conclusions
Our findings confirm the role of FSWs in West Africa as an important determinant of HIV
risk, but also identify, in countries with higher HIV prevalence, the emerging role of a group
of adolescent girls with 2+ partners is an important determinant of risk. In fact, our findings
suggest that this group may enable the epidemic to be effectively “geared up” when
partnerships are formed with higher-risk males, indicating additional prevention needs
amongst this group.
Funding
This study was funded by UNAIDS.

Introduction

2

HIV in West Africa accounts for around 20% of all infections in sub-Saharan Africa with

3

HIV prevalence here generally lower than in other African regions [1] most likely as a result

4

of the almost universal practice of male circumcision across West Africa [2]. Around 30% of

5

all AIDS-related deaths worldwide occur in West Africa with reported 280,000 AIDS-related

6

deaths in 2017 [3]but are significant variations in HIV prevalence between countries (Figure

7

1). The National Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) suggest that Nigeria, Cote d’Ivoire

8

and Cameroon have the highest HIV prevalence levels (4-6% among females and 2-4% in

9

males) in comparison to other countries (0.5-3% amongst both females and males [4,5]

10
11

Recent UNAIDS reports suggest that women are disproportionately affected by HIV in West

12

and Central Africa and account for around 57% of adults living with HIV in 2017. The

13

average HIV prevalence stands at 2.3% among adult women (15-49 years old), compared to

14

1.6% among adult men (15-49 years old) [4]. In addition, reports suggest that adolescent girls

15

and young women (aged 15-24) are disproportionately more likely to acquire HIV than their

16

male counterparts [4].

17
18

Past epidemiological studies from this region have suggested that commercial sex is a major

19

driver of the HIV epidemic [5] and that interventions focused on female sex workers (FSWs)

20

and their clients are highly effective at reducing the prevalence of sexually transmitted

21

infections (STIs) [5]. In addition, a mathematical modelling study has suggested commercial

22

sex work as a major driver of both the short and longer term epidemic trajectories in the

23

region [6]. However, our ecological analysis of variations in population prevalence levels

24

across West Africa highlight that, along with female commercial sex work, variations in HIV

25

prevalence amongst general population males and females between countries may be

26

associated with national variations in the percentage of younger females (15-24 years) that

27

have 2 or more (2+) partners in the past year, as defined by Demographic Health surveys [7].

28

The role of this adolescent girls group has previously been mentioned as a key population for

29

HIV control [8].

30
31

Our work expands this idea and aims to explore the role of this group of younger females

32

(15-24 years) that have 2 or more (2+) partners, in describing the variations in HIV

33

prevalence among different countries in West Africa. The overall aim of this work is to

34

identify the potential determinants of population variation in HIV prevalence among the

35

female and male general population in West Africa, considering 14 countries in the region.

36

Unlike our previous work [7], that focused on ecological analysis, here, we developed and

37

applied a dynamic model for HIV transmission between different cohorts at risk of acquiring

38

HIV in West Africa. Based on existing literature and work to date, we included cohorts of

39

FSW, clients and the general population. The novelty of our work is that, unlike previous

40

studies, within our model we incorporated a cohort of sexually active adolescent females with

41

multiple (2+) partners in the past year and allowed the model to have a proportionate mixing

42

pattern rather than a standard one. This means sexual partnerships between females 2+,

43

clients and males 2+ were distributed proportionately based on their number of partners (as

44

opposed to having a fixed number of sexual partners for each group). Including this group of

45

females with 2+ partners and the proportionate mixing pattern within a dynamic transmission

46

model, allowed us to model the groups’ interactions with other population cohorts and hence

47

explore their role in describing the variations of HIV prevalence in West Africa.

48

Methods

49

The methodology for this work is described in Figure 2(a) with the novel proportionate

50

mixing pattern illustrated in Figure 2(b).

51
52

Model design

53

We developed a deterministic compartmental model describing the transmission of HIV

54

infection among sexually active 15-49 year olds. The mathematical framework and model

55

equations are detailed in Appendix 1. In summary, the model stratifies the sexually active

56

population into two groups of female sex workers (brothel-based and non-brothel based) and

57

their respective client partner groups. In addition, the model includes a separate group of

58

adolescent females with 2+ non-commercial sexual partnerships in the past year and a group

59

of males (15-49) with 2+ non-commercial sex worker partners in the past year, as well as

60

subgroups representing other sexually active men and women in the general population. In

61

order to explore the population sexual mixing pattern that best represents West Africa, we

62

introduced a mixing matrix based on a “fixed proportionate” mixing scenario (depicted in

63

Figure 2(b)). Here, we created an additional parameter, ζ, to represent the proportion of

64

partnerships females 2+ have with men who are also clients (of either brothel-based or non-

65

brothel based FSW). This parameter was also sampled in the course of the uncertainty

66

analysis.

Model Parameterisation

69

Biological, epidemiological parameter data and published developmental indicators for West

70

Africa were extracted from the literature. A full parameter table, including additional

71

information on the computation and extraction of data is provided in Appendix 1. Table 1

72

below is a shortened version of the table showing only the parameters that were used as

73

model inputs for our statistical uncertainty analysis. Based on the data from DHS surveys

74

across the region we assume the entire male population are circumcised [9]. The probability

75

of transmission per act is estimated using a wide range and this incorporates the potential

76

presence of sexually transmitted infections, anal sex acts (in addition to vaginal sex acts) and

77

the effects of anti-retroviral therapy, which is introduced into the model 20 years after the

78

start of the epidemic.

79
80

Uncertainty analysis and model calibration

81

For each of these parameters in Table 1, we generated a range of plausible estimates from the

82

literature to account for the parameter variations across West African countries. We then

83

sampled within each parameter range (splitting it uniformly into 40,000 samples) using a

84

Latin Hypercube sampling [10] to generate 800,000 parameter combinations as inputs to the

85

mathematical model. For each parameter combination, the model was solved numerically in

86

R programming environment until HIV steady state across the different population cohorts

87

was achieved. To calibrate the model, only the projections where HIV prevalence was within

88

the literature-reported ranges for West Africa in 2017 (as per Figure 1 generated with data

89

from [11,12] were retained. Specifically, model projected HIV prevalence of 0.5-6% in the

90

general female population, 0.5-4% in the general male population, 15-48% in the brothel-

91

based FSW group and 10-25% in the non-brothel based FSW group were kept as model fits

92

and to reflect the HIV prevalence in West African in Figure 1. No fitting criteria were applied

93

to the female 2+ group, male 2+ group or the brothel-based FSW clients and non-brothel

94

based FSW client groups due to the provision of insufficient data for these subgroups.

95
96

Correlation analysis

97

Among the projected model outcomes we assessed the correlation of different model

98

parameters with the HIV prevalence among the general male and female population. We

99

computed the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) between the different model

100

parameters and, for those where there was correlation, the statistical significance (p-value) of

101

the correlation with male and female HIV prevalence. By doing this we characterised the

102

linear relationship between the different parameter inputs and different HIV prevalence

103

values that correspond to values within West Africa. This analysis was run in Stata v14.

104

We considered the correlation in different HIV prevalence brackets: firstly assessing the full

105

range of HIV prevalence in males (0.1-4%) and females (0.1-6%). Then, given the variation

106

in the HIV prevalence amongst females and males in West Africa across the different 14

107

countries, we considered three HIV prevalence categories for females {0.1-2%, 2-3%, 3-6%}

108

and males {0.1-2%, 2-3%, 3-4%}

109
110

Results

111

Overall, for model projected HIV prevalence to be 0.1-4% in the males, 0.1-6% in females,

112

15-48% in the brothel-based FSW group and 10-25% in the non-brothel based FSW group,

113

the model generated a total of 11,164 fits. Tables 2 and 3 contain the results of the correlation

114

analysis between HIV prevalence among females and males in 14 West African countries and

115

the model parameters. Figure 3(a)-(b) show the graphical representation of the results from

116

Tables 2 and 3, with the inner ring in each Figure containing the results from Table 2 and the

117

outer ring containing the results from Table 3.

118
119

Key determinants of HIV prevalence in females

120

When we consider all countries collectively, where HIV prevalence among the female

121

general population ranges from 0.1-6% (Table 2 and Figure 3(a) inner ring), the size of the

122

population of the female 2+ group ( ி்ௌ ) emerges as the most significant determinant of HIV

123

prevalence among females. Of importance is also the number of sexual partners this group

124

்ௌ ), as well as the size of the non-brothel based sex-worker group (
has (஼்ௌ
ிே஻ ) and the

125

parameter ( ) that describes the proportion of sex acts females 2+ have with clients of FSWs

126

(as opposed to their corresponding males 2+ group). The size of the brothel based FSW

127

groups (ி஻஻ ) is also positively and significantly correlated with HIV prevalence among the

128

females, highlighting the importance of the relative size of all sexually active female

129

population groups.

130

In 9 out of the 14 countries, HIV prevalence among females is low (0.1-2%) and female HIV

131

prevalence is most strongly correlated to the size of both brothel-based and non-brothel based

132

FSW groups ( ிே஻ and ி஻஻ ) and to a lesser extent to the size of the group of females with

133

2+ partners ( ி்ௌ ) (Figure 3(b)). However, the mixing pattern via the parameter ( and the

number of sexual partners of the female 2+ group (஼்ௌ
female HIV prevalence here (Table 2; 2nd row and Figure 3(b) inner ring). The results are

136

similar in countries (2 out of 14) where HIV prevalence is between 2-3%, with the size of the

137

FSW (ிே஻ , ி஻஻ ) groups most significantly correlated to HIV prevalence in females, and the

138

size of the female 2+ group less important. Partnership numbers and duration of being a

member of a higher-risk group (respectively  and ஼்ௌ
ring), become more important factors in countries where HIV prevalence is slightly higher.

141

For countries in which female general population HIV prevalence is within the highest

142

prevalence range, 3-6% (3 out of 14 countries), the model indicates that the size of the female

143

2+ group (ி்ௌ ) is most strongly associated with HIV prevalence (Figure 3(d) inner ring).

144

The parameter describing the proportion of partnerships females with 2+ partners form ( )

145

with clients of FSWs, continues to be an important driver of HIV prevalence, while the size

146

of the FSW groups becomes relatively less significant. This final observation is partly seen

147

because the size of the FSW groups within the model are constrained, based on evidence

148
149

from surveys.

150

Key determinants of HIV prevalence in males

139

151
152

For males, HIV prevalence ranges from 0.1-4% across the14 countries. Our results show that

153

the population size of the FSW groups (both brothel and non-brothel based; respectively

154

ி஻஻ and ிே஻ ) is the most important determinant of HIV prevalence for the male general

155

population in West Africa (Figures 3(a)-(d) outer ring). The number of client partners that sex

workers have (ி஻஻

157

male partner (௠௙  (Figure 3(a) outer ring) are important. The number of sexual partners of

158

females 2+ (஼்ௌ
ி்ௌ

159

corelated with male HIV prevalence but to a lesser extend (Table 3), as is the parameter ( )

160

that describes the proportion of sex acts females 2+ have with clients of FSWs.

161

In West African countries with lower HIV prevalence among the male general population (0-

162

2% in 12 out of 14 countries), we observe that the most relevant determinant of HIV

163

prevalence is the population size of non-brothel-based FSWs (ிே஻ ) and brothel based FSW

164

(ி஻஻ . In countries with higher HIV prevalence in the male general population (2-3% in 1 of

165

based FSWs ( ிே஻ ) also correlated but to a lesser extent (Table 3 and outer ring of Figure

168

3(c)). Finally, in countries with higher HIV prevalence among the male general population

169

(3-4%, 1 of 14 countries) only two parameters describing the size of the two FSW groups

170

significantly affect the HIV prevalence in males (Table 3; last row and outer ring of Figure

171

3(d))).

172
173

Discussion

174
175

Our results suggest that as female HIV prevalence increases across different West African

176

countries, from 0.1-2% (in 9 out of 14 countries) through to 2-3% (2 out of 14 country) and

177

then 3-6% (in 3 out of 14 country), the correlation between the parameters associated with the

178

groups of female with 2+ partners and the HIV prevalence among females increases (results

179

within the inner ring of Figure 3(a)-(d) and pictorially represented in Figure 4). Therefore,

180

our results suggest that this group of females with 2+ partners, may have a gearing-type role

181

in sustaining high HIV prevalence among females in West Africa.

182
183

In contrast, as male HIV prevalence increases, from 0.1-2% (in 12/14 countries) through to

184

2-3% (1/14 country) and then 3-4% (in 1/14 country), the correlation between the parameters

185

associated with the FSWs groups and the HIV prevalence among males increases (results

186

within the outer ring of Figure 3(a)-(d) and pictorially represented in Figure 4). Therefore,

187

our results show that the size of the FSW groups and their sexual activity may be more

188

responsible for sustaining high HIV prevalence among males in West Africa.

189
190

Past studies have emphasised the importance of sex work and other vulnerable groups as key

191

determinants of HIV prevalence [13] to sustain HIV prevalence of 0-3% among the general

192

population [6] and demonstrated that the size of the FSW population (relative to the total

193

population) is the most important determinant of HIV prevalence [14]. The findings from our

194

study show that whilst (brothel and non-brothel) sex work is an important determinant of HIV

195

prevalence in both females and males across the 14 West African countries, the size of the

196

female 2+ group, also emerges as an important determinant of HIV prevalence, particularly

197

for countries with higher prevalence levels and among the female HIV prevalence. For lower

198

level epidemics in most countries, the size of FSW groups remains the key determinant in

199

agreement with the findings of [14]. However, when stratifying the HIV epidemics into

200

respective categories of HIV prevalence in both males and females, we provide evidence of a

201

potential transitionary phrase within an epidemic which we depicted in Figure 4. This is an

202

interesting hypothesis which potentially highlights a change in the nature of an HIV epidemic

203

(perhaps more formally known as going from being a ‘concentrated’ to a ‘generalised’

204

epidemic, as characterised by UNAIDS), from one being more dependent on the size and

205

sexual activity of female sex workers, to an epidemic in which the subgroup size and sexual

206

activity of young females, with multiple partners, is of equal importance. This same transition

207

is not seen when the analysis is repeated for males, which aligns more consistently with the

208

theory of a larger population of male clients acting as a ‘bridge’ to female partners. Whilst

209

traditionally in modelling analyses, these females were thought to be ‘long term’ steady

210

partners, our analysis suggests that younger more vulnerable females could also act as a

211

highly vulnerable group for acquiring new HIV infections, particularly if they are forming

212

partnerships with men who are also clients of FSWs.

213
214

The findings from this analysis are important. Firstly, they confirm three previous findings:

215

(a) that commercial sex work remains important for HIV transmission in West Africa,

216

particularly in lower level epidemics and for sustaining HIV prevalence among the male

217

general populations, in agreement with previous findings [14] (b) that when HIV prevalence

218

is high amongst FSWs, a large proportion of HIV infections may be attributable to these

219

groups alone and is in line with previous findings [15]; and (c) they support the hypothesis on

220

the importance of behaviours that modify the risk of acquiring infection (e.g. fewer partner

221

numbers, shorter durations in sex work and higher levels of condom use) as protective

222

barriers against infection. Secondly, our results are in support of the idea of a type of

223

“epidemic gearing” effect depicted in Figure 4. This will imply that, for the epidemic to have

224

the propensity to grow, it needs to be effectively “geared up”, firstly, by smaller high-sexual

225

activity groups of FSWs, and then secondly, through the larger subgroup of adolescent

226

females 2+, which act as an additional larger “cog” in the epidemic chain enabling the

227

epidemic to achieve higher-levels of HIV prevalence (Figure 4). Here the concept of

228

behavioural heterogeneity and the importance of approaches that seek to identify high-risk

229

individuals and understanding the structure of sexual networks emerge as important.

230
231

Although our results are important, for epidemics in countries where HIV prevalence is high

232

(e.g. higher than 4% in West Africa), transmission pathways may require a more advanced

233

understanding of the underlying factors driving the epidemic. We strongly support the

234

collection of more behavioural data to better understand and inform these pathways, and

235

advocate for closer collaborations between modellers and social scientists, so that

236

mathematical model structures better reflect the true dynamics of HIV epidemics.

237
238

Our analysis does have several limitations. Estimates on the percentage of adolescent females

239

reporting 2+ partners is mostly extracted from the DHS data. Whilst there is some

240

comparability internally and between countries, typically questions on sexual behaviours are

241

prone to under-reporting, especially amongst women. All results should be interpreted with

242

caution, and the nature of the findings are partly a consequence of the model’s structure,

243

although we believe this to be a more useful representation of sexual networks and

244

transmission pathways, supported by evidence both from the modelling and social science

245

literature.

246
247

Population data from DHS surveys suggests that the percentage of adolescent females with

248

multiple partners, may comprise up to 9% of the total female population, with other studies

249

reporting higher percentages [16-18]. This modelling study, shows the importance of the size

250

and sexual activity of the female 2+ group and more broadly the need to assess and

251

understand behaviours that shape sexual network structures as well as those that modify the

252

risks of acquiring infection, in determining variations in HIV prevalence. However, to date,

253

very few mathematical models of HIV transmission in the general population explicitly

254

include or recognise the importance of an adolescent female 2+ group, despite the high levels

255

of incidence in this population. In addition, more accurate data on the estimated subgroup

256

size for high-risk groups of female sex workers is often absent from modelling studies,

257

despite demonstrating here the fundamental importance of this.

258

In our correlation analysis we have chosen to use PRCC rather than other correlation

259

coefficients, as we believe that it provides good insight on the global sensitivity of the system

260

and projects the parameters that are most influential (or significant) even if other parameters

261

are simultaneously perturbed. Other correlation analysis (e.g. Pearson correlation) are more

262

based on local sensitivity calculations and can provide insight into small perturbations around

263

the key parameters, but can often ignore the impact of large perturbations, something we

264

wanted to include. Future analysis will consider contrasting different correlation measures

265

and discuss the differences in the findings.

Our findings have the potential to have important implications for future policy. The

268

UNAIDS definition for a concentrated epidemic is one in which HIV prevalence is less than

269

1% in the general population and over 5% prevalence in key risk groups such as FSWs, with

270

the caveat being that no subpopulation is fully self-contained and these thresholds should be

271

interpreted with caution [19]. However, here we demonstrate the dangers of such rigid

272

definitions, by highlighting the subtle maturity that may occur in epidemics from those driven

273

predominantly by commercial sex work, to those in which both the role of commercial sex

274

and the size and sexual behaviours of other populations is important. The social science

275

literature should be a greater source of information, highlighting in particular the

276

vulnerability of young females [20,21].

277
278

Finally, despite much focus on interventions being towards reducing the biological

279

probability of transmission, our findings suggest that programmes which result in fewer

280

women practicing sex work and fewer young females engaging in higher-risk partnerships,

281

could play a key role in reducing the size of the HIV epidemics in West Africa. In the future,

282

sex work may become less prevalence as women become more empowered with better

283

education, jobs and earning potential as African countries continues to develop. Future

284

policies on HIV should focus on treatment, prevention, but also key aspects of women’s

285

development, to ensure they are able to make the best most informed decisions.

Figure 2 (a): Description of the methodology for this paper. (b) Sexual mixing patterns in the
population. Black arrow denote partnership: Sexual partnerships exist between the two FSW
groups and their respective client groups and between clients and females with 2+ partners.
Younger females 2+ also partner with males 2+. Separate groups of general population males
and females form partnerships with one another, with a given proportion also having longer
term partnerships with clients (in the case of females) and FSW (in the case of males (to
represent the wives of clients and husbands of sex workers, respectively).

Figure 3: (a)-(d): Bar charts of the partial rank correlation coefficient (PRCC) between a
selection of model parameters from Table 1 and the HIV prevalence in female and male
general population across different HIV prevalence brackets. The absolute values of the
PRCC are shown in Tables 2 and 3, and we only consider parameters that significantly
influence the HIV prevalence (p-value <0.05).
