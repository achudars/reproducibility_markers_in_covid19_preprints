ABSTRACT
While psychotic experiences are core symptoms of mental health disorders like
schizophrenia, they are also reported by 5-10% of the population. Both smoking behaviour
and genetic risk for psychiatric disorders have been associated with psychotic experiences,
but the interplay between these factors remains poorly understood. We tested whether
smoking status, maternal smoking around birth, and number of packs smoked/year were
associated with lifetime occurrence of three psychotic experiences phenotypes: delusions
(n=2067), hallucinations (n=6689), and any psychotic experience (delusions or hallucinations;
n=7803) in 144818 UK Biobank participants. We next calculated polygenic risk scores for
schizophrenia (PRSSCZ), major depression (PRSDEP) and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(PRSADHD) in the UK Biobank participants to assess whether association between smoking and
psychotic experiences was attenuated after adjustment of diagnosis of psychiatric disorders
and the PRSs. Finally, we investigated whether smoking exacerbates the effects of genetic
predisposition on the psychotic phenotypes in gene-environment interaction models.
Smoking status, maternal smoking, and number of packs smoked/year were significantly
associated with psychotic experiences (p<1.77x10-5). Except for packs smoked/year, effects
were attenuated but remained significant after adjustment for diagnosis of psychiatric
disorders and PRSs (p<1.99x10-3). Gene-environment interaction models showed the effects
of PRSDEP and PRSADHD (but not PRSSCZ) on delusions (but not hallucinations) were significantly
greater in current smokers compared to never smokers (p<0.0028). There were no significant
gene-environment interactions for maternal smoking nor for number of packs smoked/year.
Our results suggest that both genetic risk of psychiatric disorders and smoking status may
have independent and synergistic effects on specific types of psychotic experiences.

INTRODUCTION

2
3

Psychotic experiences, such as hallucinations (unreal visual or auditory perceptions) and

4

delusions (unreal beliefs or impressions, i.e. conspiracy against self, unreal communications

5

or signs), are reported by 5-10% of the general population (1). Psychotic experiences are core

6

symptoms of severe mental disorders, such as schizophrenia, and therefore may be an

7

indicator of risk for mental health problems even in apparently healthy individuals.

8

Understanding their aetiology could help identify individual susceptibility for different mental

9

health outcomes and develop tailored prevention and intervention strategies.

10
11

Genetic factors influence psychotic experiences, with genes explaining between 30-50% of

12

the variance in twin studies (2,3) and common genetic variation explaining between 3-17% of

13

the variance in molecular genetic studies (4,5). Twin studies also suggest that the genetic

14

component of psychotic experiences is shared with psychiatric disorders such as

15

schizophrenia, depression and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (6). Large

16

genome-wide studies of psychotic experiences in UK Biobank (UKB) confirm these findings:

17

polygenic risk scores (PRS) of schizophrenia, depression, and ADHD explain 0.11%, 0.32%, and

18

0.05% of the variance in psychotic experiences, respectively (7). Linkage disequilibrium score

19

regression (LDSC) indicates the genetic correlation estimates between psychotic experiences

20

and schizophrenia, depression and ADHD are 0.21, 0.46 and 0.24 (7).

21
22

In addition to genetic influences, environmental factors explain between 50-70% of the

23

variance in psychotic experiences (3). Smoking is one of the best established environmental

24

risk factors associated with the occurrence of psychotic experiences in case-control studies of

25

schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, as well as in population-based samples. Longitudinal

26

studies suggest that continued smoking is a causal factor for psychotic experiences among

27

people with first episode of psychosis (8), schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder patients (9).

28

The observation of a dose-response effect in prospective studies (10–13), together with

29

recent Mendelian randomization studies (14), further support a causal effect of smoking on

30

the occurrence of psychotic experiences. In addition, the associations between lifetime

31

tobacco use and subsequent psychotic experiences (15,16) in the general population

32

remained significant after adjusting for other psychiatric disorders (16), suggesting that

33

smoking may lead to psychotic experiences independently from mental health status.

34
35

Associations between other smoking phenotypes and psychotic experiences are less well-

36

established: There is much less evidence for an increased risk of psychotic experiences in

37

former smokers, leading some to suggest that the effects of smoking are reversible (17,18).

38

However, it is still unclear whether these findings are false positives resulting from a lack of

39

power in relatively small samples. Maternal smoking during pregnancy is associated with

40

psychotic experiences in offspring (19). However within-family studies suggest that once

41

familial factors are taken into account, maternal smoking during pregnancy has no effect on

42

the risk of psychotic experiences (20).

43
44

Despite evidence showing associations between genetic risk for psychiatric disorders and

45

psychotic experiences (6,7) , and a number of studies showing associations between smoking

46

and psychotic experiences (17,21–23), the interplay between smoking and genetic risk on

47

psychotic experiences remains unknown. There are studies showing that PRSs for psychiatric

48

disorders are associated with smoking (24–27). This means that smoking may not be only a

49

casual factor in the development of psychotic experiences, but that common genetic factors

50

may affect both smoking and psychotic experiences. However, no studies have tested

51

whether PRSs for psychiatric disorders and smoking make independent contributions to

52

psychotic experiences. Significant gene-environment interactions (GxE) have been reported

53

for several psychiatric traits including schizophrenia and depression (28–30), but studies are

54

yet to explore whether there is an interaction between smoking and PRSs for psychiatric

55

disorders on psychotic experiences. That is, whether the effects of genetic risk are greater for

56

individuals exposed to smoking.

57
58

Our first objective was to investigate whether smoking status (current, former or never

59

smoker), number of packs smoked per year, and maternal smoking around birth were

60

associated with lifetime delusions or hallucinations or any psychotic experience (delusions or

61

hallucinations) in the UKB cohort. We also tested whether the effects of smoking remained

62

significant after adjustment for psychotic disorders, depression and ADHD, as well as genetic

63

risk for these disorders. Our second objective was to investigate whether the effects of

64

smoking on psychotic experiences were exacerbated by genetic risk by testing additive and

65

multiplicative GxE between these variables.

METHODS:

67
68

An overview of the study design is provided in Figure 1. First we performed main effect

69

analyses, where we examined the associations between smoking (smoking status, maternal

70

smoking, and number of packs smoked per year) and psychotic experiences (delusions,

71

hallucinations, or any of the two). We conducted two additional analyses including as

72

covariates diagnosis of psychotic disorders, depression and ADHD, as well as PRSs for

73

schizophrenia (PRSSCZ), depression (PRSDEP) and ADHD (PRSADHD), to test whether the effect of

74

smoking on psychotic experiences is independent of these psychiatric diagnoses and genetic

75

predisposition. To calculate the PRSs, we used genome-wide association studies (GWAS)

76

summary statistics from published meta-analyses of schizophrenia, depression and ADHD

77

(31–33).

78
79

We next analysed the interaction effects of smoking and PRSs on psychotic experiences. We

80

interrogated whether being a current, former or never smoker; smoking more packs of

81

cigarettes per year; or being exposed to maternal smoking around birth influenced the effects

82

of PRSs on having hallucinations, delusions, or any of the two. When significant interactions

83

between smoking and PRS were identified, we carried out sensitivity analyses excluding

84

people with psychotic disorders.

UKB sample

92

The sample was drawn from UKB, a population-based cohort from the United Kingdom with

93

~500 000 participants. From those, 157 366 participants completed an online mental health

94

questionnaire. A detailed description of the mental health questionnaire has been provided

95

elsewhere (34). This research was conducted using the UK Biobank Resource under

96

Application Number #42423.

Measures

99
100

Psychotic experiences

101

Psychotic experiences were categorised based on the Composite International Diagnostic

102

Interview included in the mental health questionnaire. Three outcomes were defined:

103

delusions, hallucinations, and any psychotic experience. Delusions were ascertained as

104

individuals reporting lifetime delusions of reference and/or persecutory delusions (Field IDs:

105

20474, 20468). Hallucinations were ascertained as individuals reporting lifetime visual and/or

106

auditory hallucinations (Field IDs: 20471, 20463). Any lifetime psychotic experiences were

107

ascertained as a positive response to any of the four symptom questions (Field IDs: 20474,

108

20468, 20471, 20463). Controls were defined as individuals that did not endorse lifetime

109

psychotic experiences. A more detailed description of the outcome variables is provided in

110

the Supplementary Tables 1-3.

111
112

Smoking

113

Three smoking outcomes were defined using the UKB baseline questionnaire: Smoking status

114

(Field ID 20116), pack years of smoking (Field ID 20161) and maternal smoking around birth

115

(Field ID 1787). The smoking status phenotype consisted of never smoker, former smokers

116

and current smokers. Pack years of smoking was calculated for former and current smokers

117

and it was defined as number of cigarettes smoked per day, divided by twenty, multiplied by

118

the number of years of smoking. Cases for maternal smoking were defined as individuals

119

endorsing “Yes” for the question “Did your mother smoke regularly around the time when you

120

were born?”.

122

Other psychiatric disorders

123

Lifetime depression, ADHD, schizophrenia, mania, hypomania, bipolar or manic depression,

124

and any other type of psychotic disorder were defined using both the UKB baseline and

125

mental health questionnaires (Supplementary Tables 4 and 5).

126
127

UKB genetic dataset

128

The data release contained 488 377 individuals genotyped on either the UKB Axiom or the UK

129

BiLEVE Axiom arrays. Genotype data were imputed centrally by UKB with IMPUTE2 using the

130

Haplotype Reference Consortium panel (35). UKB also provided metrics for quality control

131

that were used to exclude individuals with poor genotype call rate (>5%) and discordance

132

between the self-reported sex and the sex inferred from the genotypes. The first two principal

133

components provided by UKB were used in a k-means clustering algorithm (36) to identify a

134

genetically homogeneous subsample. Related individuals were identified for each phenotype

135

separately using the R package ‘ukbtools’ (37) and one individual from related pairs/trios

136

were excluded (kinship coefficient > 0.0884). Details on the quality control (QC) of genetic

137

data and sample sizes after QC exclusion are provided in Supplementary Table 6.

138
139

PRSs

140

We calculated PRSSCZ, PRSDEP and PRSADHD for each UKB participant using the software PRSice-

141

2 (38) and summary statistics from three recent GWAS of these disorders (Supplementary

142

material) (31–33). Logistic regression models were used to explore the association between

143

PRSSCZ, PRSDEP and PRSADHD and psychotic experiences using PRSice-2 (38). Analyses included

144

the first ten principal components and genotyping batch as covariates.

146

Main effect analyses

147

Regression models were constructed to assess the association between maternal smoking,

148

smoking status and number of packs smoked per year and psychotic experiences. To test

149

whether the association between smoking and psychotic experiences was independent of

150

diagnosis for psychiatric disorders and genetic predisposition, models were rerun adjusting

151

for: diagnosis for psychotic disorders, depression, and ADHD, as well as the PRS with highest

152

predictive ability (p-value threshold = 0.2) on psychotic experiences.

153
154

Interaction effect analyses

155

We explored whether there were GxE between each of the PRSs and smoking on psychotic

156

experiences (i.e. whether the effects of genetic risk differed among current, former or never

157

smokers, among smokers that consumed more packs of cigarettes per year, and among

158

individuals whose mothers smoked around time of participants’ birth). Interactions were

159

tested on the multiplicative and additive scales using logistic and linear regressions,

160

respectively. Interactions on the multiplicative scale assess whether the joint effect of the PRS

161

and smoking is greater than the product of their individual effects. Interactions on the additive

162

scale assess whether the joint effect of smoking and the PRS is greater than the sum of their

163

individual effects. Modelling multiplicative and additive GxE using linear and logistic

164

regressions has been described elsewhere (29,30,39).

165
166

In the GxE regression models, we included individuals from UKB with genetic, smoking and

167

psychotic experiences data (n = 143 320 for any psychotic experience, n = 143 043 for

168

hallucinations, and n = 143 245 for delusions). Independent variables were the PRSDEP,

169

PRSADHD, or PRSSCZ for each individual, smoking phenotype, ten principal components and

170

genotyping batch. Dependent variables were lifetime occurrence of hallucinations, delusions

171

or any psychotic experience. Models also included the interaction of smoking and PRS with

172

genotyping batch and the principal components, to control for the effect of these covariates

173

on the interaction term (40). To examine whether the GxE was significant after multiple

174

testing correction (p < 0.0028 based on 18 models under additive and multiplicative models:

175

0.05/18 = 0.0028), we used the anova function from R package “car”. All models were

176

constructed in R (version 3.5.1).

177
178

Sensitivity analyses

179

The inclusion of individuals with psychotic disorders (Supplementary Table 4) may inflate the

180

variance explained by the PRSs and lead to false positive GxE. Therefore, we repeated the

181

significant interaction effect analysis after excluding individuals that met criteria for psychotic

182

disorders.

RESULTS:

184
185

157 366 individuals completed the mental health questionnaire. From those, 2 067 reported

186

delusions, 6 689 hallucinations and 7 803 any psychotic experience. 953 individuals had both

187

lifetime delusions and hallucinations. Sample sizes for controls were 155 182, 150 336 and

188

149 289 for delusions, hallucinations, and any psychotic experience, respectively.

189
190

For the smoking variables derived from the full cohort, 273 542 individuals reported never

191

smoked, 173 072 being former smokers and 52 979 being current smokers. The mean number

192

of packs per year smoked was 23.4 (SD=18.8). 126 632 individuals reported that their mothers

193

had smoked around the participant’s birth, whereas 306 266 reported the opposite. Table 1

194

includes demographic, psychiatric and behavioural characteristics of the sample before

195

genetic data QC. Supplementary Table 7 shows the number of individuals with psychotic

196

experiences stratified by smoking status, maternal smoking and mean number of packs

197

smoked per year after genetic data QC.

Smoking and psychotic experiences

202

The odds of having delusions, hallucinations or any psychotic experience was significantly

203

higher in current or former tobacco users when compared with non-users, and in participants

204

whose mothers smoked around the time of birth (Table 2). There was a positive linear

205

relationship between the number of packs of cigarettes and risk of psychotic experiences

The PRSSCZ, PRSDEP, and PRSADHD were significantly associated with psychotic experiences

220

(Supplementary Figure 1) and with smoking behaviour (Supplementary Figure 2). Therefore,

221

it is possible that genetic risk confounds the relationship between smoking and psychotic

222

experiences. To test this hypothesis, we included PRSSCZ, PRSADHD and PRSDEP as covariates in

223

the analyses. All the regression models (except packs smoked per year on delusions and

224

hallucinations) remained significant after the inclusion of the PRSSCZ, PRSADHD, and PRSDEP

225

(Table 2).

226
227

Interaction between genetic risk of psychiatric disorders and smoking on psychotic experiences

228

We found significant additive interactions between PRSADHD and PRSDEP (but not PRSSCZ) and

229

smoking status (current vs never smoker) on reporting lifetime delusions. That is, the

230

combined effect of PRSADHD and smoking, or PRSDEP and smoking was significantly greater than

231

the sum of their individual effects (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 8 for OR and β values).

232

However, there were no significant interactions between PRSs and smoking status for

233

hallucinations or any psychotic experiences (Figure 2).

234
235

To ensure that the significant interaction for PRSADHD and PRSDEP was not entirely driven by

236

participants with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, we excluded individuals

237

meeting criteria for diagnosis of psychotic disorders (Supplementary Table 9) and repeated

238

the GxE analyses. All the interaction terms remained significant (Supplementary Figure 3 and

239

Supplementary Table 10).

240
241

There were no significant interactions between the PRSs and maternal smoking, nor between

242

the PRSs and number of packs per year (Supplementary Tables 11 and 12).

DISCUSSION:

253
254

Our study investigated whether smoking is associated with the occurrence of psychotic

255

experiences independently from diagnosis of psychotic disorders, depression or ADHD, or

256

genetic predisposition for these disorders. We also tested whether the effects of smoking

257

were modulated by the genetic risk in gene-environment interaction models. We found

258

smoking status, maternal smoking and number of packs smoked per year were all significantly

259

associated with increased risk of psychotic experiences. GxE modelling indicated the effects

260

of two PRSs (DEP & ADHD) on delusions was significantly greater in current smokers compared to

261

never smokers. These results suggest both genetic risk and smoking behaviour contribute to

262

specific types of psychotic experiences.

263
264

A few previous studies have assessed PRS-environment interactions on psychotic experiences

265

finding that higher genetic risk exacerbates environmental effects. However, these studies

266

have focused exclusively on genetic risk of schizophrenia and environmental factors such as

267

stress (41) and birth weight (42). Our study is the first one to explore PRS by environment

268

interactions with smoking on psychotic experiences and the first to explore these effects in

269

the context of genetic risk of depression and ADHD. Further, our study had greater power

270

than previous ones because we used at least 30 times larger sample sizes, we calculated

271

multiple PRSs at higher p-values that increased the predictive power of the genetic score, and

272

we used the largest GWAS summary statistics available to date.

273
274

The interaction of smoking status with PRSDEP, but not with PRSSCZ, on predicting delusions is

275

of particular interest. Delusions of reference and persecution are classified as some of the

17

276

core symptoms of psychotic disorders (i.e. schizophrenia and bipolar disorder) but they are

277

rarely part of the diagnostic criteria for depression (43). Wooton et al (14) reported that

278

genetic risk for depression increased smoking, but there was unclear evidence for genetic risk

279

for schizophrenia increasing smoking. Our finding that PRSDEP (but not PRSSCZ) interacts with

280

smoking on predicting psychotic experiences points at a stronger relationship between

281

smoking and depression than between smoking and schizophrenia. Our sensitivity analyses,

282

where the interaction remained significant after excluding people with psychotic disorders,

283

supports this hypothesis.

284
285

In line with previous studies, we found significant associations between the smoking

286

phenotypes and psychotic experiences (10–13,17), and between PRSSCZ, PRSDEP and PRSADHD

287

and each of the smoking phenotypes and psychotic experiences (25,31,44,45). These findings

288

suggest that the relationship between the smoking variables and psychotic experiences may

289

be confounded by shared genetic influences. However, the effects of smoking remained very

290

similar after adjusting for PRSs, providing little evidence of genetic confounding by common

291

genetic variation associated with schizophrenia, depression and ADHD. Previous studies have

292

shown that the effects of smoking on psychotic experiences remain significant after

293

adjustment for psychiatric disorders (16). However, this is the first study to show these effects

294

also remain significant after adjustment for genetic risk of specific psychiatric disorders.

295
296

The effects of maternal smoking after adjusting for the PRSs are also interesting. Previous

297

within-family studies suggest that, once unmeasured familial factors are taken into account,

298

maternal smoking has little effect on psychotic disorders (20). In the current study, the effects

299

of maternal smoking persisted following adjustment for PRSSCZ, PRSDEP and PRSADHD. This

300

tentatively suggests that genetic risk for these disorders does not confound the relationship

301

between maternal smoking and psychotic experiences. Nevertheless, the PRSs tested only

302

capture a small fraction of the genetic risk for psychiatric disorders. Replication of these

303

effects using more powerful estimates of genetic risk will be required to test this hypothesis.

304
305

There are some limitations of this study: it is retrospective meaning it is subject to recalling

306

biases, which occur when participants do not accurately remember past experiences, and this

307

can lead to spurious results. We have relied on self-reported data, which might be affected

308

by different conceptions of what it is a psychotic experience. There were 351 individuals that

309

completed the UKB mental health questionnaire that may have also participated in the

310

Psychiatric Genomic Consortium cohorts analysed by Wray an colleagues (32). This overlap

311

was identified using a checksum-based approach as described in Howard et al (46) and the

312

impact over this overlap is unknown. We reported an interaction between genetic risk and

313

smoking, but the percentage of variance explained by the PRSs was very low (<1%), therefore

314

further work is required to understand the remaining sources of phenotypic variance. There

315

is also evidence of a “healthy volunteer” bias in UKB (47), especially among people who

316

completed the mental health questionnaire (34), which may make this study not fully

317

representative of the general population. Finally, the present study was focused on

318

individuals of European ancestry therefore these results might not be valid for other

319

ancestries (48).

320
321

Despite the limitations, we report for the first time that smoking is associated with occurrence

322

of psychotic experiences after adjusting for genetic risk for mental health, and that current

323

smokers with higher genetic risk for depression and ADHD are more likely to experience

324

delusions but not hallucinations. These results emphasise the importance of assessing

325

environmental and genetic factors jointly and separately, and exploring particular types of

326

psychotic experiences, as they can be differentially associated with smoking or other risk

327

factors. This study also highlights the relationship between smoking and depression, and

328

between smoking and ADHD on the occurrence of specific types of psychotic experiences in

329

the general population, encouraging further studies to explore the effect of genetic risk for

330

other psychiatric disorders on psychosis. Taken together, our results support the distinction

331

of types of psychotic symptoms, the inclusion of environmental factors, and the study of

332

cross-disorder genetic predictors to inform biological mechanisms underlying psychotic

333

experiences.
