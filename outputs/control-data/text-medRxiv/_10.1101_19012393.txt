Interoception in psychiatric disorders

ABSTRACT

Background

Interoception, the sensing of information about the internal physiological state of the

body, is proposed to be fundamental to normal and abnormal affective feelings. We undertook a crosssectional characterisation of cardiac interoception in patients accessing secondary mental health services
to understand how interoceptive abnormalities relate to psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses.

Methods

Patients attending adult mental health services (205 female, 101 male) and controls (42

female, 21 male) participated. Clinical diagnoses spanned affective disorders, personality disorders and
psychoses. Physiological, bio-behavioural and subjective interoceptive measures included: 1) Basal heart
rate and heart rate variability (HRV); 2) cardiac afferent effects on emotional processing (cardiac cycle
modulation of ratings of fear vs. neutral faces); 3) perceptual accuracy, confidence, and metacognitive
insight in heartbeat detection, and; 4) self-reported sensitivity to internal bodily sensations. We tested for
transdiagnostic differences between patients and controls, then for correlations between interoceptive
measures and affective symptoms, and for group differences across clinical diagnostic categories.

Results

Patients differed from controls in HRV, cardiac afferent effects on emotional processing,

heartbeat discrimination accuracy, and heartbeat detection confidence. Anxiety and depression symptom
severity correlated particularly with self-reported sensitivity to interoceptive experiences.

Significant

differences between diagnostic categories were observed for HRV, cardiac afferent effects on emotional
processing, and subjective interoception. Patients with schizophrenia relative to other diagnoses
intriguingly showed opposite cardiac afferent effects on emotion processing.

Conclusions

This multilevel characterisation identified interoceptive differences associated with

psychiatric symptoms and diagnoses. Interoceptive mechanisms have potential value for the clinical
stratification and therapeutic targeting of psychiatric disorders.

Interoception in psychiatric disorders

INTRODUCTION

Neurochemical or psychological models dominate understanding of mental illnesses. Available treatments
reflect this dichotomy. However, more integrative approaches are emerging with increasing attention to
the role of the body in psychological health

1-4

. Interoception refers to the processing and representation of

1

bodily physiology by the central nervous system . Interoception supports physical health by coordinating
homeostatic and predictive (allostatic) autonomic and behavioural responses. Psychologically, interoceptive

5-9

. Thus, interoception mediates

representations underpin associated motivational and emotional feeelings

psychological consequences of poor physical health and moderates the physical impact of negative
psychological states (e.g. stress-related cardiovascular morbidity)

3,10-12

.

Within psychiatry, interoception is in the foreground of eating disorders, somatization, and addiction. Yet
more broadly, interoceptive feelings underlie mood and anxiety symptoms

1-3

. Moreover, in contemporary

models of consciousness, interoception is proposed to be fundamental to self-representation (‘biological
self’), supporting coherent continuity of experience

12-15

. Interoceptive dysfunction may thus manifest as

disturbances of conscious selfhood e.g. dissociation, depersonalisation, and related psychotic

4,16-18

phenomena

. If interoception is central to psychological health, we need to understand its

contributions to mental disorders. The Research Domain Criteria initiative (RDoC) of the National Institute
of Mental Health (USA)

19

propose a fresh transdiagnostic biological taxonomy for mental illness towards

better treatment targets. RDoC’s major functional domains are

negative valence, positive/reward valence,

cognitive systems, systems for social processes (including self-representation) and arousal /modulatory
systems19. Arguably, interoception is a more fundamental domain supporting basic physiological regulation,
motivation, emotional feelings, and self-representation. Here, we tested how interoception relates to
diagnosis and affective symptoms in psychiatric patients.

Interoception can be conceptualised along a dimensional framework through measures of; 1) neural
signalling of internal physiology; 2) influences on perception and cognition; 3) objective accuracy of
interoceptive perception; 3) subjective sensitivity (sensibility) to internal sensations, and; 4)
interoceptive insight (e.g. awareness of the reliability of one’s perception)

metacognitive

20

. Arguably, emotional

experience is grounded upon the quality of interoceptive representations, motivating research into
individual differences, with a pragmatic emphasis on cardiac interoception

1,13,17,18, 20-28

. Heart rate variability

(HRV) reflects the integration of cardiorespiratory signalling with autonomic cardiovascular control

29,30

.

Aortic and carotid arterial baroreceptors fire at cardiac systole (when blood is ejected from the heart) to
signal to brainstem the strength of each heartbeat. These signals drive the baroreflex to stabilise cardiac
output and blood pressure through heartbeat slowing (parasympathetic activation) and reflex vasodilation
(sympathetic inhibition)

31

. In arousal/stress states, baroreflex suppression enables heart rate and blood

32

pressure to rise together

, reducing HRV. Beyond the baroreflex, arterial baroreceptor firing affects mental

processes: Systole inhibits central processing of pain (and neutral stimuli), yet enhances or preserves
perceptual processing of fear and threat

33-35

. These effects are relevant to psychopathology: Systolic

enhancement of fear/threat processing predicts heightened anxiety in non-clinical individuals

33

.

People also vary in their capacity to perceive consciously internal sensations; greater sensitivity to
interoceptive feelings (measureable using questionnaires or behavioural tasks) may predict stronger
emotional experiences. Interoceptive sensitivity is reportedly higher among anxiety and panic patients, but
lower in depression
schizophrenia

20-22,24

. Interoceptive deficits are also associated with psychotic symptoms in

17,18

. On their own, such findings are heuristic due to psychometric limitations of interoceptive

tasks

.

One influential framework distinguishes between

subjective (self-report, questionnaire/confidence),

objective (e.g. accuracy on interoceptive tasks e.g. heartbeat detection), and metacognitive (insight,
correspondence between objective and subjective measures) dimensions of interoception

1,20

. Discrepancy

between subjective and objective measures of interoception may account for affective symptoms, and is a

With converging evidence now connecting psychological symptom expression to aspects of cardiac

interoception, there is a need for systematic characterisation in clinical patients . Here we examined a
representative group of patients accessing secondary mental health services. We predicted transdiagnostic
associations between measures of interoception and affective symptoms (especially anxiety).

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Research ethics, governance and study sample

The study was approved by the National Research Ethics Service (13/LO/1866MHRNA), and registered
(ISRCTN13588109). Patients, 18+ yrs, accessing services for a recorded psychiatric diagnosis were recruited
sequentially from secondary care mental health clinics, or self-referred from advertisement in primary care
and community settings. Exclusion criteria included global cognitive impairment, neurological conditions,
and alcohol intake on day of testing. Structured diagnostic interviews were not part of the approved
protocol. Instead, clinical diagnoses by psychiatrists were confirmed from medical records. Here, 19
patients diagnosed with schizophrenia or paranoid schizophrenia were categorised separately from 26
patients diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, psychosis with affective features, or unspecified
psychosis. An anxiety group, comprising generalised anxiety, social anxiety and panic disorder, was
distinguished from posttraumatic stress, and obsessive-compulsive disorders (PTSD, OCD).

Control participants, aged 18-65 yrs, with no mental health diagnosis were recruited through poster
advertisements. Exclusion criteria were history of mental or systemic medical illness and medication
affecting cardiovascular or cognitive function. Assessments took place in university facilities and hospital
clinic rooms.

Assessment of cardiac physiology and interoceptive dimensions

Heart Rate and Heart Rate Variability (HRV). Pulse-oximetry (Nonin Xpod® 3012LP with soft finger-mount37
was used to record heart rate (averaged over six epochs of the heartbeat tracking task, below) and HRV,

38

from root mean square of successive pulse differences; RMSSD

(during the cardiac timing task below,

representing longest continuous periods of pulse recording).

Cardiac timing effects on fear and neutral face processing. Quantification of cardiac interoceptive
influences on emotional processing in non-clinical individuals reveal that ratings of perceived fear intensity
are enhanced (or preserved), yet ratings of neutral faces are attenuated, at systole relative to diastole. This

33

differential effect predicts anxiety symptoms

. This methodology was adapted for laptop assessments with

pulse-oximetry. For 80 randomised trials over two blocks, participants viewed neutral or fearful faces (100
ms), rating each face for emotional intensity (Fig 2A). Stimulus onset was either at ventricular systole (onset
300 ms from estimated ECG R-wave) or late diastole (50ms before ECG R-wave); timing determined from

preceding three pulse timings.

Post hoc evaluation enabled exclusion of outlier trials where onsets

exceeded +/-75ms windows from intended systolic or diastolic timings (Fig. 2A).

Heartbeat Tracking Task27. Participants counted felt heartbeats at rest, over six randomised 25, 30, 35, 40,
45 and 50 second epochs, then rated their confidence on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from ‘total guess/no
heartbeat awareness’ to ‘complete confidence/full perception of heartbeat’. Interoceptive accuracy was
quantified by comparing number of reported heartbeats to recorded pulses
computed from accuracy/confidence correspondence (Pearson correlation)

20

. Metacognitive insight was

20

.

Heartbeat Discrimination Task26,39,40. Each trial consisted of 10 auditory tones (440Hz for 100ms) presented
either synchronously or delayed relative to heartbeats. Synchronous tones were triggered at the rising edge
of the pulse pressure wave. Delayed tones were presented 300ms later. This procedure mirrored

40,41

established timings of maximum and minimum synchronicity judgements

. After each trial, participants

judged if tones were synchronous or delayed relative to their heartbeats, then rated response confidence.
They completed 40 trials over two sessions. Accuracy was measured as proportion of correct trials.
Metacognitive insight was computed from accuracy/confidence correspondence (receiver-operating
characteristics, ROC, curve)

20

.

Porges Body Perception Questionnaire (BPQ)42,43 and Interoceptive Trait Prediction Error. Subjective
interoceptive ‘sensibility’ was quantified from self-rating awareness of bodily sensations on the BPQ-

awareness scale. Interoceptive Trait Prediction Error (ITPE)25 quantified ‘interoceptive surprise’ from
discrepancy between subjective s (BPQ-awareness score) and objective (heartbeat tracking accuracy)
interoceptive measures

25

.

Assessment of affective symptoms

Affective symptoms were rated using; 1)

Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)44, a 21 question self-report scale

of symptoms associated with depression. 2)

State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI)45, a 40-item self-report

questionnaire measuring state (20 items) and trait anxiety (20 items).

Statistical analyses

Data were analysed parametrically (General Linear Model). Initial analyses compared all patients with
controls on physiological and interoceptive measures. Pearson correlations tested for relationships
between physiological/interoceptive measures and affective symptoms in patients. Further comparisons
tested for effects of antidepressant and antipsychotic medication.

Next, comparisons between diagnostic groups excluded groups with fewer than 10 members and patients
with complex mixed diagnoses (excluded: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder N=4; autism N=5; eating
disorders N=8; post-traumatic stress disorder N=6; obsessive compulsive disorder N=9; depersonalization
disorder N=1; complex mixed diagnoses N=52). Exploratory comparisons of schizophrenia/schizoaffective
groups were also undertaken.

To quantify direct relationships with clinical status and symptoms, initially we did not correct for age, sex,
or body mass index (BMI). Analyses were then repeated, treating these potential influences on physiology
and interoception as confounding covariates to increase inferential precision and balance groups on
baseline factors. We did not impute for missing values present across the dataset.

RESULTS

Baseline characteristics (Table 1)

Patients were overall older (patients vs controls; yrs mean ± SD: 38.9 ±14.1 vs 35.0 ± 13.2, [F(1,368)=4.1,

P=.04]) with greater BMI (kg/m2: 26.4 ± 7.1 vs 23.0 ± 3.6, [F(1,336)=9.2, P=.003]). 56% of patients and 67%
of controls were female. Most patients took medication.

Differences between patient and control populations on cardiac and interoceptive measures

Patients did not differ from controls in heart rate (patients vs controls; bpm 73.0 ± 11.6 vs 70.6 ± 8.9,
[F(1,331)=1.9,

P=.17] ), but had lower HRV (RMSSD; patients vs controls; ms: 51.6 ± 42.6 vs 70.8 ± 58.4

[F(1,341)=8.8,

P=.003]). This difference became non-significant when age, sex, and BMI were included as

confounding covariates (Fig. 1, Table 1).

[Figure 1 about here]

Across all participants (patients plus controls), as anticipated

33

, systole preserved/augmented the rated

intensity of fearful faces, and decreased rated intensity of neutral faces, amplifying differences between
these emotions (systole versus diastole, interaction i.e. difference between fear vs neutral intensity, 6.0 ±
16.3 [t(324)=6.7,

P<.001]; fear intensity change 1.1 ± 11.9 [t(331)=1.7, P=.09]; neutral intensity change %, -

4.77 ± 11.5 [t(328)=-7.5,
F(3,298)=5.15,

P<.001] ). Inclusion of baseline covariates preserved these effects (interaction

P=.002; fear F(3,303)=1.9, P=.14); neutral (F(3,303)=5.4, P=.001).

Patients differed from controls in cardiac timing effects on emotional processing (interaction; 5.2 ± 16.1 vs
10.5 ± 16.1, [F(1,324)=4.8,
7.7 ± 10.6, [F(1,328)=4.4,

P=.03]; fear 0.7 ± 12.3 vs 3.0 ± 9.8, [F(1,331)=1.6, P=.20]; neutral -4.1 ± 11.5 vs -

P=.04]) (Fig. 2; Table 2). Inclusion of baseline covariates attenuated this difference

(interaction 5.3 ± 16.3 vs 11.7 ± 16.6, [F(1,298)=2.0,

P=.16]; fear 2.5 ± 10.6 vs 0.96 ± 12.4, [F(1,303)=0.2,

P=.66]); neutral -4.1 ± 11.6 vs -9.4 ± 10.6, [F(1,302)=3.5, P=.06]) (Fig 2).

Interoception in psychiatric disorders

On the heartbeat tracking task, patients were significantly less confident than controls (VAS: 4.2 ± 2.6 vs 5.4
± 1.8; [F(1,333)=8.82,

P=.003]; with baseline covariates [F(1,318)=10.3, P=0.001]). However, there were no

group differences in performance accuracy (5.6 ± 1.4 vs 6.0 ± .16, [F(1,348)=3.0,
insight (0.21 ± 0.5 vs 0.18 ± 0.5, [F(1,309)=.24,

P=.09]), nor metacognitive

P=.62]) (Fig. 3, Table 2).

On the heartbeat discrimination task, patients again showed lower confidence than controls (patients vs
controls; VAS: 5.0 ± 2.4 vs 5.9 ± 1.8 [F(1,332)=5.85,

P=.02]; with covariates [F(1,317)=6.3, P=.01]). Also,

patients’ performance accuracy was lower (patients vs controls 0.52 ± 0.1 vs 0.57 ± 0.2, [F(1,331)=4.8,

P=.03]; with covariates [F(1,316)=4.8, P=.03]). Again, groups did not differ in metacognitive insight on this
task (0.52 ± 0.14 vs 0.54 ± 0.14, [F(1,327)=4.8,

P=.38].

[Figure 3 about here]

Self-rated interoceptive sensibility (BPQ, awareness scale) did not distinguish patients from controls (0.05 ±
1.5 vs 0.06 ± 1.4 [F(1,230)=4.8,

P=.64]). Similarly, there were no group differences in interoceptive trait

prediction error (ITPE 112.2 ± 29 vs 114.5± 34 [F(1,323)=4.8,

P=.89]). Thus, patients differed from controls

in the impact of cardiac signals on emotional processing, and showed reduced confidence and sensitivity in
judging their own cardiac sensations. These effects were not primarily attributable to differences between
controls and patients in physiology, subjective awareness or metacognitive representation of internal
bodily state.

Correlations with affective symptoms

In patients (controls excluded), depressive score (BDI score) correlated with state and trait anxiety (STAI-Y1

R(306)=0.54, P<.001; STAI-Y2 R(306)=0.74, P<.001). However, we found no initial correlation between
depression score and heart rate, HRV, or interoceptive measures, except subjective interoceptive sensibility
(BPQ-awareness,

R(282)=0.34, P<.001) and ITPE (R(199)=0.22 P=.002). When we controlled for baseline

covariates, depression score remained positively correlated with anxiety, subjective interoceptive
sensibility (BPQ –awareness

R(152)=0.31, P<.001), and ITPE (R(152)=0.24, P<.002). Depression score also

then showed a weak negative correlation with HRV (RMSSD

R(152)=-1.7, P=.04). Thus, across all patients,

depressive symptoms were associated with anxiety, heightened subjective sensitivity to bodily sensations
and (weakly) withdrawal of parasympathetic cardiac tone.

Interoception in psychiatric disorders

Anxiety symptoms correlated with depression score but did not correlate with heart rate (STAI Y1

R(298)=0.11, P=.07; STAI-Y2 R(298)=0.02, P=.073), nor HRV (STAI Y1 R(298)=0.03, P=.63; STAI-Y2
R(298)=0.05, P=.37). However, trait anxiety correlated with cardiac timing effects on fear processing
R(276)=0.13 P=.02), and metacognitive insight on heartbeat discrimination (R(284)=0.18, P=.002). State

(

and trait anxiety also correlated with subjective interoceptive sensibility (BPQ-awareness; STAI-Y1

R(282)=0.33, P<.001; STAI-Y2 R(282)=0.39, P<.001) and ITPE (STAI-Y1 R(282)=0.23, P<.001; STAI-Y2
R(282)=0.22, P<.05). When we controlled for baseline covariates, trait anxiety remained correlated with
cardiac timing effects on fear processing (

R(152)=0.17, P=.04), and state and trait anxiety remained

correlated with interoceptive sensibility (BPQ-awareness; STAI-Y1

R(152)=0.26, P=.001; STAI-Y2

R(152)=0.33, P<.05) and ITPE (STAI-Y1 R(152)=0.16, P=.05; STAI-Y2 R(152)=0.17, P=.04). Thus, across
patients, anxiety symptoms were associated with increased subjective sensitivity to bodily sensations.
However, transdiagnostic links between affective symptoms and either physiology or cardiac effects on
emotional processing were weak, and we found no overarching association with heartbeat detection
ability.

Medication effects

We tested for general effects of antipsychotic and antidepressant medication. Patients taking only other
medications (including Benzodiazepines, Pregabalin, Valproate, and Lithium) were excluded due to small
group sizes, N<10. Significant findings were limited to: (1) Marginally higher heart rate in people on
antipsychotics, an effect lost when controlling for baseline covariates (antipsychotic vs no antipsychotic;
bpm 73.8 ± 11.5 vs 72.7 ± 11.3 [F(1,276)=4.76,

P=.03]; with covariates [F(1,264)=0.39, P=.53]) . (2)

Significantly lower HRV in patients on antipsychotics (RMSSD ms: 42.1 ± 31 vs 58.5 ± 47 [F(1,268)=9.9,

P=.002], with covariates F(1,276)=4.8, P=.03). (3) Increased subjective interoceptive sensibility with
antidepressant use (antidepressant vs no antidepressant; BPQ-awareness scale: 116.4 ± 29.4 vs 108.8 ±
27.6 [F(1,269)=4.82,

P=.03]; with covariates [F(1,258)=4.74, P=.03]). Thus, there was reduced HRV in

patients taking antipsychotic medication. A weaker association between antidepressant medication and
subjective interoception was consistent with an association with affective symptomatology.

Differences between patient diagnostic groups on cardiac and interoceptive measures

We tested for differences in physiological and interoceptive measures between groups of patients
categorised according to recorded clinical diagnoses. Diagnostic groups included depression (N=58),
‘anxiety disorder’ (N=28), mixed anxiety /depression (N=41), bipolar disorder (N=53), emotionally unstable

personality disorder (N=21), ‘schizoaffective disorder’ (N=20) and schizophrenia (N=18) (See Methods and
Table 1).

No effect of group emerged for heart rate ([F(6,241)=0.36,
but there was an effect on HRV [(F(6,234)=3.3,

P=.92]; with covariates [F(6,232)=0.83, P=.55];

P=.004]; with covariates [F(6,226)=2.4, P=.03]). There was a

differential cardiac timing effect on emotional face processing ([F(6,234)=3.1,
[F(6,226)=2.8,

P=.006]; with covariates

P=.01]) and a trend for this effect on fear alone ([F(6,238)=2.1, P=.06]). Objective

performance accuracy, subjective confidence in heartbeat perception, and metacognitive interoceptive
awareness of heartbeat, did not discriminate clinical groups (Fig. 3). However, groups differed in subjective
interoceptive sensibility (BPQ-awareness scale [F(6,236)=2.4,

P=.03]; with covariates [F(6,228)=1.8, P=.10]

trend) (Fig 3).

[Figure 3 about here]

Decreased HRV characterised patients with diagnoses of bipolar disorder, emotional unstable personality
disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia, relative to anxiety and depression groups (and
controls). Interestingly, for cardiac effects on emotional processing, the normative modulation of fear and
neutral processing were reversed in patients with a primary clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia (Fig. 2). This
reversed effect was not observed for patients in the ‘schizoaffective’ group (exploratory analysis
schizophrenia vs schizoaffective; interaction [F(1,40)=6.9,
[F(1,40)=3.15,
F(1,36)=4.3,

P=.01][; with covariates F(1,36)=7.9, P=.008]; fear

P=.08]; with covariates [F(1,36)=6.0, P=.02]; neutral [F(1,40)=5.7, P=.02]; with covariates

P=.045). This group difference was not accounted for by medication (group x antipsychotic

effect, interaction [F(1,30)=0.01,

P=.94]) nor by illness duration, retrieved for schizophrenia and

schizoaffective patient records (i.e. cardiac timing effect remained significant when illness duration was
included as confounding covariate (all covariates: [interaction F(1,34)=6.0,

P=.02]). Higher scores for

Interoception in psychiatric disorders

DISCUSSION

In a representative patients using mental health services in the UK, we characterized interoception, i.e.
processing and representation of internal bodily physiology
between interoception and psychopathology

, especially anxiety symptoms, previously linked to

29,46

, cardiac effects on emotional processing

21,22,24

, self-reported bodily sensibility

subjective measures of interoception

20,25

. We predicted a transdiagnostic relationship

1-5,9,13,15,17,18

differences in physiology (heart rate and HRV)
detection accuracy

1-5

33,34

, heartbeat

47

, and discrepancies between objective and

.

Correspondingly, we found that patients differed from controls in physiology (HRV), cardiac effects on
emotional processing, subjective ratings of interoceptive performance accuracy (heartbeat discrimination),
and subjective interoceptive confidence. Across patients, subjective interoception paralleled affective
symptoms: Lower interoceptive confidence alongside higher subjective interoceptive sensibility (self-rated
trait interoceptive ‘beliefs’) and interoceptive trait prediction error (ITPE; divergence of subjective

25

interoceptive sensibility from objective interoceptive accuracy

), correlated with affective symptoms.

However, such symptoms showed limited transdiagnostic association with physiology, despite established
coupling of perseverative cognition (worry and rumination) to lower HRV

48

. Reduced HRV correlated weakly

(after covariate correction) with depressive symptoms. Moreover, HRV was observed to be lower in

46

diagnoses other than depression and/or anxiety disorder (see below)

.

Our hypothesis that cardiac effects on emotional processing would predict anxiety symptoms, was partly
supported: Across patients, enhancement of fear processing by systole (i.e. arterial baroreceptor signals)
correlated with trait anxiety. Moreover, patients with a unitary diagnosis of anxiety disorder (i.e.
generalised anxiety disorder or panic) showed the strongest systolic enhancement of fear processing

34

.

Overall however, our findings endorse a more general association between subjective aspects of
interoception and affective symptoms.

Our data also demonstrates differences in interoception between psychiatric diagnostic categories. First,
our findings extend previous reports of markedly reduced HRV in patients with emotionally unstable
(borderline) personality disorder

49

50

, bipolar disorder

51,52

or schizophrenia/psychosis

. Speculatively, this

may reflect vulnerability to dissociative states. Cardiac effects on emotional processing also differentiated
patient groups: While patients with an anxiety diagnosis showed strongest systolic enhancement of fear,
patients with clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia stood out from all other groups in showing an opposite
cardiac effect on emotional processing. This difference even contrasted with the normative response
observed in patients with schizoaffective disorder/unspecified psychosis, whose symptomatology and
(antipsychotic) medication overlaps with schizophrenia. Trends toward faster mean heart rate and worse
heartbeat tracking accuracy suggest more pervasive interoceptive deficits in schizophrenia. Schizophrenic
and schizoaffective groups were also differentiated by the schizoaffective patients significantly under-

Interoception in psychiatric disorders

reporting subjective sensitivity

20

to bodily sensations. The clinical distinction between schizophrenia and

schizoaffective disorder is rarely examined in research studies, favouring instead a broader diagnosis of
psychosis. Although psychotic phenomena suggest disordered self-representation

13-19

, our study’s focus on

transdiagnostic relationships between interoception and affective symptoms meant that we did not
quantify psychotic and dissociative symptoms. However antipsychotic medication, and illness duration, did
not provide a compelling account for interoceptive differences in schizophrenia. Thus, our exploratory
findings motivate further research to characterise schizoaffective and schizophrenic symptoms with
attention to interoceptive profiles

17

.

Heartbeat detection tasks seek to quantify stable individual differences in sensitivity to cardiac sensations.
Typically the heartbeat counting task gives a spread of accuracy scores, while the harder heartbeat
discrimination task produces a more binomial distribution (i.e. at chance, or above chance). Nevertheless,

28,53

these tasks have recognised psychometric limitations

: Actual heart rate, knowledge of one’s average

heart rate, and the ability to estimate time, can influence performance accuracy particularly on heartbeat
tracking. The perceived signals themselves may be ‘quasi-interoceptive’, i.e. somatosensory correlates of

53

internal physiology

. These factors contaminate objective measurement of interoceptive sensitivity with

subjective beliefs and predictions about what should be felt (sensibility

20

). Notwithstanding, heartbeat

detection tasks remain relevant to inferences about how bodily-sensations influence emotional states. In
non-clinical populations, heartbeat detection ability is frequently associated with anxiety symptoms, yet
attenuated by depressive symptoms

23,24

. In schizophrenic patients, reduced heartbeat detection accuracy

reportedly correlates with positive psychotic symptoms

17

. Within our study, patients performed worse than

controls on the heartbeat discrimination task, though among patient groups, performance accuracy was
broadly equivalent (schizophrenic patients tended to perform worse). While interoceptive methods can be
further optimised for patient stratification, we demonstrate reliable implementation of heartbeat detection
tasks within clinical settings.

In psychiatry, interoception is a treatment target. Medications influence interoceptive processes; e.g.
peripheral cardiovascular arousal is suppressed by beta-blockers, while monoaminergic drugs (from
stimulants in ADHD, to antidepressant / anxiolytic SNRIs) target central neuromodulatory pathways
governing central arousal and descending autonomic control. Trials repurposing antihypertensive drugs,
e.g. Losartan

55

, and research on interoceptive immune-brain and gut-brain signalling

3,10,11,54

promise

alternative treatment approaches. Non-pharmacological therapies also exploit interoceptive mechanisms.
These include physical interventions, notably vagus nerve stimulation

57

autonomic biofeedback training)

56

, bio-behavioural therapies, (e.g.

, and integrative interventions (e.g. mindfulness and yoga)

58

, whose

therapeutic utility can be optimised with better mechanistic understanding of interoceptive actions.

Interoception in psychiatric disorders

This study follows a timely call for interoceptive processes to be considered foundational to psychiatric

1

disorders . We show the feasibility of a multilevel characterization of interoception in patients spanning
diagnostic categories. Our findings reveal transdiagnostic interoceptive deficits linked to mood symptoms,
and suggest interoceptive measures can differentiate patients by diagnosis, notably potentially selective
abnormalities in schizophrenic patients that merit further investigation. Interoception thereby offers
emerging targets for therapeutic intervention in psychiatric disorders.

Figure 1 Physiological differences across controls and patients accessing secondary mental health

services

A) Heart rate

Heart rate was recorded for control and patient participants (at rest with interoceptive attentional focus).
Differences between controls and the patients as a whole, nor between patient diagnostic subgroups, did
not attain threshold significance. Across patients, anxiety symptoms (state) correlated with heart rate
(R=0.14

P<.05) but not with measures of depression or anxiety. Heart rate did not differentiate patients on

or off antipsychotic nor antidepressant medication.

B) Heart rate variability (HRV)

The patient population as a whole manifest lower heart rate variability compared to controls (HRV RMSSD;
patients versus controls; ms mean ± SD: 70.19 ± 58.4 vs 51.6 ± 42.6, F(1)=8.8,
symptoms correlated negatively with HRV (RMSSDSD R=-0.15,

P<.005). Depression

P<.01). There were significant differences in

HRV between diagnostic groups of patients (RMSSDSD without age, sex, and BMI covariates: F(6)=3.3,

P<.01; with covariates included F(6)=2.4, P<.05). HRV was no different in people on and off antidepressant
medication, but significantly lower in patients on antipsychotic medications (RMSSD; antipsychotic vs no
antipsychotic; ms mean ± SD: 42.6 ± 31 vs 59.4 ± 48, F(1)=7.1,

P<.01).

Figure 2 Afferent cardiac (heart timing) effects on processing of fearful and neutral faces

A) Illustration of heart timing paradigm on emotional processing

Participants were Asked to rate the perceived emotional intensity of fearful face stimuli and neutral face
stimuli derived from an emotional face dataset. Stimuli were presented briefly (150ms) to coincide with
firing of arterial baroreceptors at cardiac systole (onset ~250ms from electrocardiograph R wave) or in
baroreceptor quiescence at late diastole (onset ~150ms before - R wave). Timings were determined by a
predictive algorithm from earlier heartbeats using pulse oximetry. Post hoc data cleaning excluded trials
with onsets outside +/-75ms from intended timings, separating two cardiac timing phases. Previous work
demonstrates relative enhancement of ratings for fear vs neutral face expressions at systole vs diastole
correlating with reported anxiety symptoms

33

. The figure shows indicative fearful and neutral faces, the

onsets of presentation overlaid on ECG and ventricular pressure waveform and the distribution of diastolic
and systolic trials.

B) Differences across controls and patients in cardiac afferent effects on emotional face processing:

Interaction of fearful vs neutral for ventricular systole vs diastole

Patients, compared to controls, showed a significant difference in cardiac afferent (heart timing;
interoceptive baroreceptor signalling at systole) effects on fear vs neutral faces (interaction; patients vs
controls; %intensity change mean ± SD: 5.1 ± 16.1 vs 10.5 ± 16.1, F(1,324)=4.8,

P<.05; F(1,298)=2.0,n.s. with

age, sex and BMI covariates). Between patient diagnostic groups, there was a significant differential cardiac
timing effect on fear vs neutral face processing (without age, sex, and BMI covariates: F(6,234)=3.1,
with covariates: F(6,234)=2.8,

P<.01

P<.05). There was no correlation with affective symptoms nor with

antidepressant or antipsychotic medication use. However, a marked difference was observed between
schizophrenic patients and other clinical groups, including schizoaffective disorder.

C) Differences across controls and patients in cardiac afferent effects on fearful face processing at

ventricular systole vs diastole

Patients, compared to controls, showed no overall difference in cardiac afferent (heart timing;
interoceptive baroreceptor signalling at systole) effects on fearful face processing (patients vs controls;
%intensity change mean ± SD: 0.7 ± 12.3 vs 3.0 ± 9.8, F(1,331)=1.6, n.s., also n.s. when controlling for age,
sex and BMI). Between patient diagnostic groups, there was a trend difference in cardiac timing effects on
fearful face processing (without age, sex, and BMI covariates: F(6,238)=2.1, P=0.06 with covariates:
F(6,230)=1.7, n.s.). There was no correlation with affective symptoms nor with antidepressant or
antipsychotic medication use. However, a significant difference was observed between schizophrenic
patients and other clinical groups, including schizoaffective disorder.

D) Differences across controls and patients in cardiac afferent effects on neutral face processing at

ventricular systole vs diastole

Patients, compared to controls, showed a significant difference in cardiac afferent (heart timing;
interoceptive baroreceptor signalling at systole) effects on neutral face processing (patients vs controls;
%intensity change mean ± SD: -4.1 ± 11.5 vs -7.7 ± 10.6, F(1,328)=4.4,

cardiac timing effect on neutral face processing (without age, sex, and BMI covariates: F(6,236)=1.3, n.s.,
with covariates: F(6,228=1.5, n.s.) There was no correlation with affective symptoms nor with
antidepressant or antipsychotic medication use. However, a difference was observed between
schizophrenic patients and other clinical groups, including schizoaffective disorder.

Figure 3 Performance of controls and patients on heartbeat detection tasks

A) Heartbeat tracking task

1) Performance accuracy

Participants were asked to count their heartbeats over 6 epochs (25s to 50s) and performance accuracy
derived from proximity of reported heartbeat number with the actual number of heartbeats recorded
veridically. However, there were no patient vs control differences in performance accuracy on this task.
Performance accuracy across patients did not correlate with affective symptoms and, despite visibly lower
accuracy in the group of patients with clinical diagnosis of schizophrenia, the overarching test for between
patient group differences did not reach criterion for significance.

2) Confidence

After each epoch of counting, the participant reported the number of perceived heartbeats and then gave a
judgment of how confident they felt about their response accuracy. Patients were significantly less
confident than controls in their performance (patients vs controls; VAS mean ± SD: 4.2 ± 2.6 vs 5.4 ± 1.8,
F(1)=8.82,

P<.005). This effect remained significant with age, sex, and BMI covariates (patients vs controls;

VAS mean ± SDSD 4.2 ± 2.6 vs 5.5 ± 1.8, F(1)=10.3, P=0.001). Depression score correlated negatively with
confidence in performance on the heartbeat tracking task (R=-0.11 P<005). Trait anxiety similarly correlated
negatively with confidence on the heartbeat tracking task (R=-14,

P<.01). However, between diagnostic

patient groups, differences in mean confidence did not reach criterion significance.

3) Insight: accuracy confidence correspondence

We correlated scores for performance accuracy with confidence measures for each participant to derive a
metric of metacognitive insight i.e. how well their confidence matched their performance. In the
comparison of controls versus patients, there were no significant differences in metacognitive awareness
(insight) into interoceptive ability. Similarly, difference across patients did not reach significance and this
insight measure did not predict diagnostic group membership or correlate with affective symptoms

B) Heartbeat discrimination task

1) Performance accuracy

Over repeated trials, participants were asked to judge if a series of notes were in time with their heartbeats
or out of phase Patients’ performance accuracy was significantly lower than controls (patients vs controls
without covariates; mean ± SD: 0.52 ± 0.1 vs 0.57 ± 0.2, F(1)=4.8,
F(1)=4.7,

P<.05; with age, sex and BMI covariates

P<.05).

2) Confidence

After each trail of heartbeat discrimination, the participant gave a judgment of how confident they felt
about their response accuracy. Overall patients were significantly less confident in their performance
compared to controls (patients vs controls without covariates; VAS mean ± SD: 4.2 ± 2.6 vs 5.4 ± 1.8,
F(1)=8.82,

P<.005; with age, sex and BMI covariates, F(1)=6.3, P<.02). We observed no significant

correlation between confidence measures on this task and affective symptomatology

3) Insight: accuracy confidence correspondence

Using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves we compared correlated scores for discrimination trialby-trial performance accuracy with confidence measures for each participant to derive a metric of
metacognitive insight i.e. how well their confidence matched their performance. In the comparison of
controls versus patients, there were no significant differences in metacognitive awareness (insight) into
interoceptive ability. Similarly, difference across patients did not reach significance and this insight measure
did not predict diagnostic group membership or correlate with affective symptoms.
