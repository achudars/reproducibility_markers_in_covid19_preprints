Abstract
Background: There is a wealth of literature on the observed association between childhood
trauma and psychotic illness. However, the relationship between childhood trauma and
psychosis is complex and could be explained, in part, by gene-environment correlation.
Methods: The association between schizophrenia polygenic scores (PGS) and experiencing
childhood trauma was investigated using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents
and Children (ALSPAC) and the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa).
Schizophrenia PGS were derived in each cohort for children, mothers, and fathers where
genetic data were available. Measures of trauma exposure were derived based on data
collected throughout childhood and adolescence (0-17 years; ALSPAC) and at age 8 years
(MoBa).
Results: Within ALSPAC, we found a positive association between schizophrenia PGS and
exposure to trauma across childhood and adolescence; effect sizes were consistent for both
child or maternal PGS. We found evidence of an association between the schizophrenia
PGS and the majority of trauma subtypes investigated, with the exception of bullying. These
results were comparable in MoBa. Within ALSPAC, genetic liability to a range of additional
psychiatric traits was also associated with a greater trauma exposure.
Conclusions: Results from two international birth cohorts indicate that genetic liability for a
range of psychiatric traits is associated with experiencing childhood trauma. GWAS of
psychiatric phenotypes may also reflect risk factors for these phenotypes. Our findings also
suggest that youth at higher genetic risk might require greater resources/support to ensure
they grow-up in a healthy environment.

Introduction
There is a wealth of literature from observational studies showing an association
between childhood trauma and psychotic illness. Recent studies have suggested that
exposure to interpersonal violence or neglect in childhood can increase the risk of psychotic
symptoms by 2-3 times (van Dam et al., 2012; Varese et al., 2012; Trotta, Murray and
Fisher, 2015; Cunningham, Hoy and Shannon, 2016; McGrath et al., 2017). These findings
suggest that childhood trauma is a causal environmental risk factor for both sub-clinical
psychotic symptoms and psychotic disorder. However, the relationship between childhood
trauma and psychosis is complex and could be explained, in part, by gene-environment
correlation.
Gene-environment correlation reflects the association between an individual’s
genotype and their environment (Jaffee and Price, 2008). There are three types of geneenvironment correlation, commonly referred to as: passive, evocative (or reactive), and
active (or selective) (Jaffee and Price, 2008). In each case, there is an observable
association between genotype and environment, although the presumed mechanisms
underlying these correlations are distinct. Passive gene-environment correlation occurs
when there is an association between genetic information passed from parent to child, and
the environment in which the child is raised. For example, it could be that parents with a
genetic predisposition to psychosis may be more liable to behaviours that create an
environment in which the child is subject to exposure to traumatic stress. In this case, as for
evocative and active gene-environment correlation, trauma would be a marker for genetic
risk of psychosis, not necessarily a cause of psychosis (Jaffee and Price, 2008). In addition
to passive gene-environment correlation, parental genotype can also influence child
phenotype via the genetic information that is not transmitted. This process is known as
dynastic effects, where parent phenotype can influence their offspring’s outcomes (Kong et
al., 2018; Brumpton et al., 2019). Evocative gene-environment correlation is the association
between an individual’s genetic predisposition to a certain behaviour, and reactions of others
to that behaviour. For example, the child may exhibit traits that elicit reactions of others
around them – e.g. harsher parenting or victimisation by peers. Active gene-environment
correlation occurs when an individual seeks out a particular environment based on their
genetic information. For example, individuals with increased genetic predisposition to
sensation seeking behaviours may be more likely to seek out riskier environments, such as
associating with individuals who misuse substances, and hence have increased risk of
substance misuse themselves. In our psychosis example, children with certain traits may
seek out environments in which they may be more vulnerable to exposure to traumatic
events. The relative importance of each type of correlation is presumed to change with

development, with passive most influential earlier in life and active becoming more important
as individuals begin to select their own environment (Scarr and McCartney, 1983).
Building from these insights, we hypothesized that the observed association between
childhood trauma and psychosis is due, in part, to a gene-environment correlation. In all
three situations, an association between the occurrence of psychosis (as a result of
increased genetic liability) and trauma could occur as a result of gene-environment
correlation, meaning without trauma being causal. However, it is also possible that geneenvironment correlation can be part of a causal chain, a fact utilised by a technique known
as Mendelian randomization which relies on such correlations to infer causality (Davey Smith
and Ebrahim, 2005; Gage et al., 2016). Whilst a number of lines of evidence support the
view that traumatic experiences can have a causal effect on psychosis risk, it is important to
understand the extent of gene-environment correlation in this relationship as: i) this will lead
to more accurate estimates of any causal effect of trauma on psychosis, and ii) this can
support the argument to provide support to individuals at high genetic risk to minimise the
occurrence of traumatic events. To examine this possibility, we investigated genetic
correlations between psychosis and trauma by testing the association between polygenic
scores (PGS) for schizophrenia and childhood trauma exposure across two international
longitudinal cohorts.

Methods
Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC)
ALSPAC is a longitudinal pregnancy cohort which aimed to recruit all pregnant
women in the former county of Avon with an expected due date between April 1991 and
December 1992. Detailed information has continued to be collected on mothers, partners
and children in the cohort, this process has been described in detail elsewhere (Boyd et al.,
2013; Fraser et al., 2013; Northstone et al., 2019). Ethics approval for the study was
obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics
Committees. Informed consent for the use of data collected via questionnaires and clinics
was obtained from participants following the recommendations of the ALSPAC Ethics and
Law Committee at the time. Please note that the study website contains details of all the
data that is available through a fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool.
Measures of childhood trauma
The ALSPAC measures of childhood trauma were described in detail elsewhere
(Croft et al., 2019). In brief, trauma exposure was collected prospectively from 0-17 years

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19006577; this version posted September 13, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which

and supplemented by retrospective data collected at age 22 years. Information was collected
on several categories of trauma exposure and questions were carefully selected to reflect
experiences that would likely be highly upsetting to anyone encountering them. In ALSPAC,
childhood trauma was derived using parent and child responses to a range of questionnaires
collected across childhood and adolescence. In early childhood (before age 5 years), only
parent-reported data were available, while in adolescence (between ages 11 and 17 years)
measures of trauma were mainly child-reported. When both child- and parent-report data
were available, these were combined to derive the exposure to trauma measure.
A composite measure of ‘any trauma’ was derived spanning the whole of childhood
and adolescence (0-17 years) as well as trauma at several intervals (0-4.9 years, 5-10.9
years, and 11-17 years; Figure 1). Trauma exposures were also separated into distinct
domains, namely bullying, domestic violence, sexual abuse, emotional neglect, emotional
cruelty, and physical cruelty.
Polygenic scores (PGS) for schizophrenia liability
Genotyped data were available on 7,977 children and 8,196 mothers in the ALSPAC
study. Data were also available on a subset of fathers within the cohort (n=1,481). Details of
genotyping and quality control measures are available in Supplementary Materials.
PGS for schizophrenia liability were derived for mothers, fathers, and children with
genetic data available and were standardised prior to analyses. Schizophrenia PGS were
derived as described in Jones et al. (2018). These scores were based on publicly available
summary statistics published by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC)
(Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2014). Overlapping
SNPs in the GWAS summary statistics and the ALSPAC imputed genetic data were
identified and LD clumping was used to identify independent genetic variants, with priority
given to those with a stronger association in the PGC discovery GWAS. Weighted PGS were
calculated using the effect estimates from the PGC GWAS, with SNPs being included in the
PGS depending on the strength of the association in the original PGC GWAS. Thirteen
schizophrenia association p-value thresholds were used ranging from p<0.5 to p<5x10-8 (see
Table S1 for a complete list), with a greater number of SNPs included as the p-value
thresholds became less conservative.
Statistical analyses
Multiple imputation: To maximise sample size and reduce selection bias due to
attrition, multiple imputation was used to impute missing values in the trauma data. The
imputation model included a broad range of variables related to trauma or variables known
to be associated with sample missingness, in addition to the schizophrenia PGS and all

variables included in any of the analysis models. A full description of the imputation strategy
can be found in the Supplementary Materials.
Analysis:
All analyses were performed in Stata 15 (StataCorp, 2017). Unadjusted logistic regression
was used to investigate the strength of association between the schizophrenia PGS and
experiencing childhood trauma. For our main analyses, we focused on PGS at a threshold of
p≤0.05 (PGS0.05) as this threshold explains the most variability in genetic liability for
schizophrenia in other samples (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium, 2014).
Four main outcomes were examined; these were trauma measured across the whole of
childhood and adolescence (age 0-17 years) and then at specific intervals during this period
(0-4.9 years, 5-10.9 years, 11-17 years). The associations between schizophrenia PGS0.05
and specific trauma subtypes were also investigated. Each analysis was repeated using
PGS0.05 derived for the mothers, fathers and the children.
Sensitivity analyses: We performed three sensitivity analyses. First, we examined the
association between all PGS thresholds from p<0.5 to p<5x10-8 and exposure to trauma
measured between 0-4.9 years of age. By restricting our analyses to this younger age group,
it was expected that attrition would be minimal, and effects observed within this subset would
be less prone to selection bias. Analyses were also performed using the complete-case
data, to check consistency of results with the imputed dataset.
Second, we performed unadjusted logistic regression of child PGS0.05 on trauma
exposure, restricting the analysis to only those children with data available on mother and
father genotype. We then re-ran this model, adjusting for mother and father genotype to
estimate the association between child PRS and trauma, independent of parental genotype.
Finally, we examined whether the association with trauma exposure was specific to
genetic liability for schizophrenia or if it extended to psychiatric traits more generally. We
created maternal and child PGS0.05 for several additional psychiatric phenotypes, described
below, and conducted unadjusted logistic regressions to investigate the association between
these scores with exposure to ‘any trauma’ at age 0-4.9 years. These additional phenotypes
were attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Demontis et al., 2019), autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) (Grove et al., 2019), bipolar disorder (Stahl et al., 2018), major depressive
disorder (MDD) (Wray et al., 2018), neuroticism (Luciano et al., 2018), an updated
schizophrenia risk score (Pardiñas et al., 2018), and a joint cross-disorder phenotype
consisting of five major psychiatric disorders (Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric
Genomics Consortium et al., 2013).

Replication in MoBa
We attempted to replicate the PGS-trauma association in an independent sample,
the Norwegian Mother, Father and Child Cohort Study (MoBa). MoBa is a prospective
population-based pregnancy cohort study conducted by the Norwegian Institute of Public
Health (Magnus et al., 2016). Participants were recruited from all over Norway from 19992008. In 40.6 % of the pregnancies, women consented to participate. The cohort now
includes 114,500 children, 95,200 mothers and 75,200 fathers. Blood samples were
obtained from both parents during pregnancy and from mothers and children (umbilical cord)
at birth. Genotyping is ongoing. The current study is based on version 12 of the qualityassured data files released for research in August 2018. The establishment and data
collection in MoBa were previously based on a license from the Norwegian Data protection
agency and approval from The Regional Committees for Medical and Health Research
Ethics (REC); it is now based on regulations related to the Norwegian Health Registry Act.
The current analyses were approved by REC (reference number 2016/1702).
Details of genotyping and quality control measures in MoBa are available in
Supplementary Materials. PGS0.05 for schizophrenia liability were calculated for mothers,
fathers and children with genetic data available at the time of analysis (15,208 children,
14,804 mothers and 15,198 fathers). Childhood trauma was measured in MoBa at age 8
years using maternal responses to questions selected to reflect experiences that would be
highly upsetting to anyone encountering them (Figure 1). There were genetic data and
trauma data available on 7,244 children. Bullying was defined as being subjected to beating,
kicking or other violence by other children in the past year (n=1,665, 23.0%), emotional
neglect as not usually letting the child know when he/she is doing a good job at something
(n=124, 1.7%), and physical abuse as being subjected to beating, kicking or other violence
by adults in the past year (n=49, 0.7%). In addition, the three questions were used to derive
a composite measure of ‘any trauma’ (n=1,765, 24.3%). Details of the questions and
prevalence in the full MoBa cohort are available in supplementary materials (Table S2).
Within MoBa, the association between PGS0.05 and trauma exposure was assessed
in complete-cases using logistic regression adjusting for chip, batch and 10 principle
components.

After imputation, 13,595 participants had data on childhood trauma within ALSPAC.
By 17 years, 72.8% of the sample were reported to have experienced any trauma. Levels of
trauma were lower in those with genetic data (n=9,946), with 70.7% of participants
experiencing trauma compared to 78.5% of those without genetic data (n=3,649) (Table 1).
In MoBa, 42,236 participants had information on trauma measured at 8 years; of
these individuals, 25.3% reported experiencing any trauma at this age, with ‘bullying’ being
the most frequently endorsed exposure (Table S2).
Association between schizophrenia PGS and experiencing trauma across childhood
and adolescence
Within ALSPAC and across PGS scores derived based on child and mother data, we
found evidence of an association between the schizophrenia PGS0.05 and increased
exposure to childhood trauma at ages 0-5 years, 6-11 years, and 11-17 years, as well as
across childhood and adolescence (0-17 years: ORChild=1.14, 95% CI: 1.08, 1.20, p=8.4x106

; ORMother=1.13, 95% CI: 1.06,1.20, p=8.5x10-5; Table 2). When using the smaller sample of

fathers that had schizophrenia PGS0.05 available, the effect estimates were compatible with
those observed using the mother and child PGS0.05, although there was no strong evidence
of an association (0-17 years: ORFather =1.04, 95% CI: 0.92, 1.17, p=0.549; Table 2).
Subtypes of trauma
When investigating the association between schizophrenia PGS0.05 and different
types of trauma within ALSPAC, we found both maternal and child PGS0.05 were associated
with the majority of trauma subtypes (Table 3). However, we found no robust evidence of an
association between either maternal or child PGS0.05 and bullying. We also observed a
similar pattern of effects when using paternal PGS0.05 (Table 3).
Sensitivity analyses
When using both parental and child PGS generated using SNPs associated with
schizophrenia at a range of p-value thresholds, we observed a positive association between
increased PGS and experiencing trauma at all p-value thresholds (Table S1).
When looking at the association between PGS0.05 and trauma across the lifecourse
using complete-case data, effect estimates were largest at the youngest ages where attrition
was minimal (Table S3), and these were in a consistent direction, although attenuated,
compared to the effects estimated when using the imputed data.
In the restricted sample of individuals with data on both mother and father genotype,
we found strong evidence of an association between increased child PGS0.05 and trauma,
with the observed effect sizes larger than in the analyses containing the full child sample

(Table 4). After adjusting for both maternal and paternal genotype, the strength of evidence
of association was reduced, although effect estimates were consistent with those estimated
in the full child sample (Table 4).
We also examined the association of alternative psychiatric PGS0.05 with childhood
trauma. We found strong evidence of an association between the MDD, neuroticism, crossdisorder phenotype and the updated schizophrenia PGS and childhood trauma, with similar
effect sizes found for most of these associations (Table S4). For both cross-disorder and
MDD, these associations were stronger when using the child PGS0.05 than the maternal
PGS0.05. There was also some evidence of an association between childhood trauma and
ADHD and bipolar disorder PGS0.05, but this was weaker. Evidence for these findings was
consistent when using either maternal or child PGS0.05.
Replication in an independent sample
Within MoBa, there was some evidence of association between the schizophrenia
PGS0.05 and trauma exposures at age 8 years (Table 5). The effect estimates for any trauma
were largely consistent with those estimated in ALSPAC at a similar age (6-11 years; Table
2).

Discussion
The main finding of this study is that PGS for schizophrenia liability were associated
with increased exposure to childhood trauma within two independent and international birth
cohorts. This finding was consistent when using both parental and child PGS, suggesting
that it is unlikely to be solely driven by direct genetic effect from either parents or children.
We also found that genetic liability to a range of additional psychiatric traits were associated
with a greater trauma exposure. This highlights that individuals at higher genetic risk for poor
mental health may benefit from supports that decrease their risk of trauma. It may also
suggest that the original GWASs of these psychiatric traits are not only identifying variants
associated with the trait of interest, but are also reflecting the effects of risk factors for these
traits.
As GWAS studies become larger and thus statistically more powerful, they can
identify variants of increasingly small effect that are robustly associated with the disorder
being studied. For example, prior to 2014, GWAS had identified around 30 loci associated
with schizophrenia (Schizophrenia Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium,
2014). With the publication of a large meta-analysis performed by the Schizophrenia
Working Group of the PGC (2014) this increased to 108 loci in 2014 and to 145 loci in 2018

(Pardiñas et al., 2018). However, with these gains in power comes the potential to detect
small effects that are not direct genetic effects, but rather may reflect the effects of
modifiable risk factors for the disorder under investigation (Gage et al., 2016). An example of
this is the 2008 paper by Amos and colleagues who performed a GWAS of lung cancer, and
in the process identified a variant located in the nicotinic receptor gene cluster CHRNA5-A3B4 (Amos et al., 2008). This locus is known to be robustly associated with smoking quantity,
a well-known risk factor for lung cancer (Tobacco and Genetics Consortium, 2010; Ware,
van den Bree and Munafò, 2011). It therefore seems possible that if exposure to childhood
trauma is a risk factor for schizophrenia, then variants associated with trauma exposure
could be picked up in the original schizophrenia GWAS. In addition to acting as an
instrument for schizophrenia, this PGS could therefore be acting as a proxy for factors that
could contribute to trauma exposure, and the association we observe between the PGS for
schizophrenia liability and childhood trauma could be as a result of this. If sufficient data and
robust instruments were to become available, approaches such as Mendelian randomisation
for mediation could be used to contribute to these questions.
In addition to investigating the association with a single composite measure of
trauma, we also examined several subdomains of trauma in an attempt to disentangle the
relationship further. These subdomains were: bullying, domestic violence, sexual abuse,
emotional neglect, emotional cruelty, and physical cruelty. When using both maternal and
child PGS, we observed strong evidence of an association between increased schizophrenia
PGS and all domains of childhood trauma across the life course, with the exception of
bullying. Paternal PGS again generally showed a consistent direction of effect but, due to the
smaller sample size, analyses were underpowered to detect effects. With the exception of
bullying, each of our trauma subdomains are likely to occur within the home environment.
Bullying, which often takes place at school and in the neighbourhood, showed little evidence
of an effect in the ALSPAC cohort. Within ALSPAC, the bullying domain predominantly
captured peer bullying, with only a single item on sibling bullying. In contrast, we did observe
some association within MoBa, however, the bullying measure in MoBa includes exposure to
violence from siblings. This suggests that there may be something specific to the home
environment that is influencing this PRS-trauma exposure association, indicative of geneenvironment correlation. If evocative gene-environment correlation was at play, we may
expect to observe an association with bullying in addition to the other types of trauma.
Equally, if active gene-environment correlation was occurring, we may expect to see a
stronger association with the child PGS compared to the parental PGS. Given that we do not
see either, and instead find that the association appears to be specific to more likely homebased exposures, it is possible that some form of passive gene-environment correlation is

occurring, and that trauma could be a marker of genetic liability for later psychosis as well as
a causal risk factor for psychosis. If the association that we observe in the home
environment is due to parental traits, then establishing which of these traits play a role in
shaping the greater ‘traumagenic’ environment could enable us to target modifiable factors in
order to reduce their occurrence and impact. Although sufficient data is not currently
available, analyses investigating between-sibling effects could go some way to disentangling
these associations.
After adjusting analyses for parental PGS to investigate the effect of child genotype
independently of parental genetic effects, we found that at younger ages the child genotype
effect estimates attenuated substantially, while during adolescence effect estimates
remained consistent. Since trauma is predominantly parent-reported at younger ages with an
increasing number of self-reported measures in adolescence, one explanation is that this
could be capturing reporting bias. An alternative argument is that child genotype becomes
more influential for later trauma as children age, hence a transition occurs from a passive
gene-environment correlation to a more active gene-environment correlation model.
Previous findings suggest that those exposed to trauma in early life are at greater risk of
revictimization in adolescence, which may also contribute to this observation (Fisher et al.,
2015). If true, prevention measures should focus on parents and supporting a healthy
homelife earlier on in childhood and targeting the children themselves as they approach
adolescence. Developing prevention measures to reduce vulnerability to trauma among
individuals with a higher genetic liability to poor mental health if timed right could help to
reduce subsequent onset of mental illness among these high-risk individuals.
We also investigated the association between childhood trauma with child and
maternal PGS for a number of alternative psychiatric phenotypes, using the latest available
data (Pardiñas et al., 2018). We observed an association between several of these scores
and childhood trauma; however, the strongest effects were with PGSs for schizophrenia and
neuroticism. Results from the updated schizophrenia GWAS were comparable with the main
analysis using PGS from the 2014 GWAS. There was strong evidence when looking at child
PGS for MDD and a cross-disorder phenotype, but these effects were smaller when using
maternal PGS. It seems likely that the association with childhood trauma is not necessarily
specific to schizophrenia, but genetic predisposition to poor mental health in general. These
findings are in line with recent work by Schoeler and colleagues (2019) and Leppert and
colleagues (2019) who both found an association with genetic vulnerability to mental illness
and exposure to bullying and other stressful life events.
The observed association between genetic liability for poor mental health and
exposure to childhood trauma does not suggest that the majority of individuals with a mental

health disorder will expose their children to traumatic events. The measure of trauma used in
our study was very broad, meaning that exposure to it was common, even for individuals
with a low genetic liability. The mechanisms through which the association between genetic
liability and childhood trauma acts could be such that individuals with a higher genetic
liability for poor mental health outcomes may end-up in more deprived neighbourhoods
where exposure to trauma may be more common (Solmi et al., 2019), or that they engage in
relationships where domestic violence is more likely to occur. These mechanisms would
again suggest a form of passive gene-environment correlation, with the association arising
between the genetic information passed from parent to child, and the environment in which
the child is raised. If this is the case, then this suggests that those with higher genetic liability
for mental illness may be most vulnerable to these effects and should be offered increased
support to decrease their risk of trauma.
Another potential implication of our findings is that the observational association
between childhood trauma and subsequent psychotic events may be, in part, due to genetic
confounding, meaning that any causal effect of trauma on psychosis is somewhat weaker
than the observed association between childhood trauma and subsequent psychosis would
indicate. In a previous study using the ALSPAC cohort, we showed that the association
between trauma and psychotic experiences was not attenuated by adjusting for either child
or mother genetic risk for schizophrenia (Croft et al., 2019). Therefore, whilst the results from
this present study indicate that exposure to trauma is higher where parents have a higher
genetic risk for psychiatric disorders, this does little to challenge the theory that trauma has a
causal effect on psychosis risk. Whilst measurement error in the PGS could have led to
residual confounding in the study by Croft et al, and led to an overestimate of association, it
seems unlikely that gene-environment correlation offers a plausible explanation for the
trauma-psychosis relationship described in observational studies to date.
There are several limitations in our study that should be considered. First, there was
substantial missing data in the trauma variable which could have resulted in selection bias.
However, we used multiple imputation to impute our sample and maximise sample size, and
the effect estimates in the complete cases at the youngest age bracket were comparable
with those from the imputed dataset. In ALSPAC, attrition has been shown to be patterned
by genetic risk factors (Taylor et al., 2018), therefore given the increased possibility of
selection bias when using data at the older ages where attrition was greater, we also
restricted this analysis to trauma measured up to age 5 years. We observed similar results at
this age to the overall effect estimates, with a positive association between increased PGS
and experiencing trauma. Second, the sub-set of fathers with genetic data was limited and
so these father-based analyses were underpowered. We aimed to improve this by replicating

in MoBa. Third, the trauma variables in the MoBa cohort were measured at age 8 years only
and not as extensively as in the ALSPAC cohort. Therefore, we were unable to recreate
completely comparable subdomains of trauma to disentangle the gene-environment
correlation in this cohort. Fourth, in MoBa and the early childhood measures of trauma in
ALSPAC were parent-reported only. It would be interesting to repeat these analyses
comparing the parental PGS with parent-reported trauma exposure and child PGS with selfreported trauma exposure. However, in ALSPAC at the ages where self-reported measures
were available (age 8 years onwards), the direction of effect remained consistent. Including
analysis of parent’s own reported exposure to childhood trauma may also provide a more
complete context for understanding the interplay between genetic risk and environmental
factors that contribute to the risk of traumatic exposure during childhood.
Conclusion
Analyses across two international birth cohorts indicate that genetic liability for
schizophrenia, as well as other psychiatric phenotypes, is associated with childhood trauma.
This could suggest that GWAS for these psychiatric traits are not only identifying variants
associated with these traits, but may also reflect risk factors associated with them. We also
found evidence to suggest that the association between genetic liability for schizophrenia
and exposure to trauma has some specificity to the home environment and suggests that
youth at higher genetic risk might require greater resources/support to ensure they grow-up
in a healthy environment.
