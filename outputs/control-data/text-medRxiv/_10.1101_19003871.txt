Abstract
Malnutrition and infectious disease often coexist in socially inequitable contexts. Malnutrition in the perinatal period adversely
affects offspring development and lifelong non-communicable disease risk. Less is known about the effects of infectious disease
exposure during critical windows of development and health, and links between in utero HIV-exposure in the absence of neonatal
infection, perinatal nutritional environments, and infant development are poorly defined. In a pilot feasibility study at Kalafong
Hospital, Pretoria, South Africa, we aimed to better understand relationships between maternal HIV infection and the early
nutritional environment of in utero HIV exposed uninfected (HEU) infants. We also undertook exploratory analyses to investigate
relationships between food insecurity and infant development. Mother-infant dyads were recruited after delivery and followed until
12 weeks postpartum. Household food insecurity, nutrient intakes and dietary diversity scores did not differ between mothers living
with or without HIV. Maternal reports of food insecurity were associated with lower maternal nutrient intakes 12 weeks postpartum,
and in infants, higher brain-to-body weight ratio at birth and 12 weeks of age, and attainment of fewer large movement and play
activities milestones at 12 weeks of age, irrespective of maternal HIV status. Reports of worry about food runout were associated
with increased risk of stunting for HEU, but not unexposed, uninfected infants. Our findings suggest that food insecurity, in a
vulnerable population, adversely affects maternal nutritional status and infant development. In utero exposure to HIV may further
perpetuate these effects, which has implications for early child development and lifelong human capital.

Introduction
Suboptimal nutrition and poor maternal metabolic health during
pregnancy and in the postpartum period are known to impact fetal
development, particularly of the brain [1,2], and infant health trajectories
after birth [3]. In contrast, the effects of fetal exposure to maternal
infectious diseases during critical windows of development on offspring
growth, neurodevelopment, and lifelong health are less understood. HIV
infection has profound effects on maternal physiology and pregnancy
outcomes, including increased risk of preterm birth, low birth weight, and
increased susceptibility to subsequent infections in infants [4,5]. HIVexposed, infected (HEI) infants show poorer motor, cognitive, language,
and behavioural outcomes compared to controls as early as three months
of age [6–9]. However, as global access to antiretroviral therapy (ART)
for pregnant and breastfeeding women increases and mother-to-child
HIV transmission declines [10], the population of HIV-exposed (in utero
or during breastfeeding) but uninfected (HEU) infants continues to rise.
Immune dysfunction, inflammation, metabolic abnormalities, and
intestinal dysbiosis persist in HIV-infected individuals on ART,
including pregnant women [11]. Some evidence suggests that HEU
infants may have persistently altered motor and cognitive development
[12–14], albeit to a lesser extent than HEI infants. However, the extent to

which inflammatory and metabolic derangements in the mother shape
development in their HEU infants remains poorly understood.
The developing brain is also vulnerable to the effects of suboptimal
maternal nutrition, as the fetal and neonatal brain depend on nutrition
supplied by the mother through transplacental transfer and through
breastfeeding and other enteral feeds, to support periods of rapid growth
during the perinatal period [15]. Malnutrition (under- or overnutrition)
during critical periods of brain development alters neuroanatomical
development (neuronal cell growth and proliferation, synapse
development, and circuit formation), neurochemistry (synthesis of
neurotransmitters, neurotransmitter receptors, and re-uptake
mechanisms), and neurophysiology (neurometabolic alterations) [1]. The
dependence of the developing brain on adequate nutrition during
sensitive periods of its growth and development makes especially the
developing fetus, and also the neonate, highly vulnerable to the effects of
food and nutrition insecurity.
Interactions between exposure to infectious disease (such as HIV) and
malnutrition (such as undernutrition and food insecurity), are important
to consider, given that malnutrition and infectious diseases often coexist
in socially inequitable contexts. Maternal immunosuppression related to

HIV infection may be exacerbated by malnutrition [16], and the
comorbidity of these exposures for infants in utero and during the
breastfeeding period may be more detrimental than the occurrence of one
of these circumstances alone. South Africa not only faces the greatest
HIV burden globally, with 19% of the world’s population who live with
HIV residing in South Africa, but also reports comparable rates of
malnutrition and food insecurity [17]. Understanding the extent to which
in utero HIV exposure, without infant HIV infection, influences infant
development is a public health priority [18], and due to the high rates of
food and nutrition insecurity, it is therefore also critical to understand
how the early nutritional environment interacts with infectious exposures
to influence developmental trajectories in HEU infants.
We undertook a prospective cohort pilot feasibility study in Pretoria,
South Africa, to determine if we could recruit women through our clinics
to study the cooccurring effects of HIV exposure and maternal nutrition
on growth and neurodevelopment in infants in early life, and to advance
our knowledge on these exposure-outcome relationships. We
hypothesised that mothers living with HIV would experience greater
household food insecurity, and that maternal HIV infection would
influence infant feeding patterns. We also undertook exploratory
analyses to investigate overall household food security and diet quality
in this cohort, hypothesising that food insecurity alone would be
associated with infant feeding patterns, and infant growth and
neurodevelopmental outcomes.

Infant anthropometry
Infant weight, length, and abdominal and head circumference and body mass index
(BMI) were measured at birth and in infants aged 12 weeks. Infant anthropometry
were age- and sex- standardised using World Health Organization (WHO) growth
standards (WHO Anthro software v 3.2.2, January 2011) [21]. A brain weight
estimate was calculated using an equation derived by the National Institute of
Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke’s Collaborative Perinatal
Project [22]:
brain weight (g) = 0.037 x head circumference (cm)2.57

[22]

The brain weight estimate was used to calculate the infant brain-to-body weight
ratio (BBR)[23]:
BBR = 100 x (brain weight estimate [g])/(birth weight [g])

[23]

BBR is used as a measure of potential in utero asymmetric intrauterine growth
restriction (IUGR) and brain sparing [23]. Weight gain from birth to 12 weeks
postnatal age (kg/day) was calculated using the weight of an infant at birth and
follow up, and the days alive since birth at follow up:

From the obstetric unit at Kalafong hospital, women living with and without HIV
were recruited within four days of delivery (HIV infected: n=32, HIV uninfected:
n=22) and followed-up at 12 weeks (range 8-16 weeks) postpartum (HIV infected:
n=21, HIV uninfected: n=10) at the Maternal and Infant Health Care Strategies
Unit (MIHCSU) of the South African Medical Research Council. Study
recruitment took place between June-December 2016, with all follow up data
collected by March 2017. All infants exposed to HIV were tested for infection at
birth and 12 weeks postpartum and were confirmed negative. This study was
approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Health Sciences of
the University of Pretoria (185-2016) and the Carleton University Research Ethics
Board (108870).

Infant neurodevelopment
The Guide for Monitoring Child Development (GMCD) [20] was developed,
standardised and validated [24] for use in low- and middle-income countries,
including South Africa, to assess expressive and receptive language, play
activities, relating and response behaviour, and fine and large movement in infants
1 to 24 months postpartum. An assessment for each infant was carried out once
between 8 and 16 weeks postpartum by trained staff at the MIHCSU, which
involved the researcher asking the child’s caregiver a series of open-ended
questions relating to the child’s development. The GMCD monitors infants who
are 1-3 months of age (defined as 1 month to 2 months and 30 days) for
achievement milestones listed in the 1-3 month category, and infants who are 3-5
months (3 months+1 day to 4 months+30 days) for achievement of all milestones
up to 3-5 months. Infants who were premature (<37 weeks) were assessed
according to corrected gestational age. GMCD outcomes were quantified in 2
ways. First, the total number of 1-4 month GMCD milestones attained by each
infant, regardless of whether the infant fell was 1-3 or 3-5 months of age at follow
up, was quantified for expressive and receptive language, play activities, relating
and response behaviour, and fine and large movement. Next, the proportion of
infants having attained all milestones in their age category (1-3 months, or 3-5
months) for expressive and receptive language, fine and large movement, play
activities and relating/response behaviour, compared to the proportion that had not
attained all milestones, was quantified.

Recruitment and eligibility

Secondary exposure and outcome measures

A research nurse recruited eligible women after delivery. Exclusion criteria
included infant delivery by caesarean section, pregnancy complications (including
gestational diabetes mellitus, multiple gestations), or antibiotic exposure during
labour or delivery and/or the postpartum period. Women were also ineligible to
participate if they were from other regions and would find it difficult to come back
for follow-up.

Maternal food security and dietary recall
A questionnaire was developed to collect maternal reports of food security.
Mothers were asked if, in the past 12 months, 1. They and other household
members worried that food would run out before they got money to buy more
(often true, sometimes true, or never true), 2. The food that they and other
household members bought just didn’t last, and there wasn’t any money to get
more (often true, sometimes true, or never true), and 3. They and other household
members couldn’t afford to eat balanced meals (often true, sometimes true, or
never true). Due to our small sample size, maternal reports of ‘often true’ and
‘sometimes true’ were grouped together for analyses as ‘experiences food
insecurity’ and compared with ‘never true’ responses.

Methods
Study population

Data collection
A retrospective medical chart review was conducted after delivery to extract
antenatal data, including maternal characteristics (age at conception, ethnicity,
parity, gravidity, smoking status, weight during pregnancy); medication use during
pregnancy (including antibiotic exposure); illness/infections during pregnancy;
and pregnancy outcomes (duration of gestation). At the postpartum follow up visit,
mothers completed a questionnaire to assess breastfeeding practices, maternal
lifestyle factors (including alcohol intake and smoking), and nutrition (including
vitamin supplements, food security, and a 24-hour dietary recall). Where visits to
clinics or hospitals occurred between birth and the follow up visit, the patientretained child health record (Road to Health Chart [19]) was examined to extract
data on infant weight, history of illness and medication use.

Primary outcome measures
Primary outcomes of interest were anthropometry in infants at birth and 12 weeks,
weight gain from birth to 12 weeks postpartum, Apgar scores at one and five
minutes, and neurodevelopmental status (Guide for Monitoring Child
Development [20]) in infants aged 12 weeks.

White et al. | medRχiv | September 12th 2019 |

Maternal dietary recall data collected detailed all food and drink consumed in the
day prior to the follow up appointment. Dietary recall data were analysed using
FoodFinder3 [25], a dietary analysis software programme developed by the South
African Medical Research Council, specific to the nutrient composition of foods
in South Africa. The estimated average requirements (EARs) and tolerable upper
levels (TULs) for available nutrients from the Institute of Medicine Dietary
Reference Intakes were used to evaluate the nutritional adequacy of reported
maternal diets [26]. These reference intakes have been used previously to evaluate
diet composition in various South African cohorts [27]. A dietary diversity score
(DDS) was calculated as an additional measure of diet quality using nine food
groups (1. Cereals, roots and tubers, 2. Vegetables and fruits rich in Vitamin A, 3.
Other fruit, 4. Other vegetables, 5. Legumes, 6. Meat, poultry and fish, 7. Dairy,
8. Eggs, and 9. Fats and oils) as previously validated and described in South
African cohorts [28,29]. Each food group was only counted once.

Infant feeding patterns
At follow up, mothers reported whether they were, or had ever, exclusively
breastfed their infants. If the infants were currently receiving formula, the mothers
provided the age when formula had been introduced. Feeding practices were only
available until 8 weeks of age for the youngest infant at follow up, so this was
chosen at the cut off for Figure 1 to plot feeding patterns for the whole cohort.

Data analysis
Data were analysed using JMP 14.0. Data were tested for normality and univariate
analysis (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis/Wilcoxon test for non-parametric data, or
Welch’s test for normal data with unequal variance) was used to compare maternal
dietary intake nutrient levels for mothers living with and without HIV. Differences
in the probability that mother’s living with compared to without HIV reporting
that they experienced food insecurity or had a DDS <4 were assessed using
Fisher’s exact test (2-tail).
To explore overall household food security and diet quality in this cohort, and
possible relationships between household food insecurity and infant growth, we
conducted comparisons of: 1. Anthropometry of infants at birth and 12 weeks of
age, 2. Apgar scores (one and five minutes), and 3. GMCD milestones attained in
infants aged 12 weeks for infants whose mothers reported on food security using
adjusted multiple regression models, and Fisher’s exact test (2-tail) was used to
quantify differences for probability of: 1. Stunting at birth or 12 weeks of age, 2.
Exclusively breastfeeding at follow up, and 3. Attaining all age-appropriate
GMCD milestones, between infants whose mothers reported food insecure
conditions compared to those who did not. We also explored whether relationships
between suboptimal nutritional environments and infant development would occur
to a greater degree in HEU than HUU infants. Using Fisher’s exact test (2-tail),
we compared probability of : 1. Stunting at birth or 12 weeks of age, 2. Exclusively
breastfeeding at follow up, and 3. Attaining all age-appropriate GMCD milestones
for HEU and HUU infant groups.
Maternal data on food security and dietary recall were only available for mothers
whose infants attended follow up, when the questionnaires were administered.
Therefore, relationships between maternal HIV status, diet, and reports of food
(in)security with infant anthropometric and GMCD outcomes at birth and in
infants aged 12 weeks were only examined in this subset (HIV infected: n=21,
HIV uninfected: n=10) of the original cohort recruited at birth (HIV infected: n=
32, HIV uninfected: n= 22).
Variables that are known or suspected confounders for our outcome measures were
included as covariables in regression models where the exposure of interest was
maternal reports of food (in)security, and variables with a=0.20 were retained
through stepwise backward elimination for the final models. Maternal covariables
included HIV status, age, education, weight at delivery, gravidity, parity, smoke
exposure, breastfeeding practices. Infant included anthropometry, gestational age,
sex, age (days) at follow up, weight gain from birth to 12 weeks of age. Variables
included in final adjusted models for outcomes at birth and 12 weeks of age can
be seen in Supplementary tables S1 and S2. With the pilot study’s small sample
size in consideration, we calculated adjusted retrospective power (AdjP) to
determine the probability that the any effects of HEU on infant outcomes found
during analyses were true with 80% certainty (AdjP>0.80). Findings are presented
as unadjusted medians [IQR], with AdjP and p value from ANCOVA.

Results
Cohort characteristics
There were no differences among the 31 (HIV infected n=21, HIV
uninfected n=10) mother-infant dyads at follow up for maternal weight
at delivery, age, level of education, or reports of food insecurity
(Supplementary Table S3). No mothers reported consuming alcohol
during pregnancy, and all mothers were non-cigarette smokers, however,
one woman reported consuming snuff. Of the infants in attendance at
follow up, three were born preterm (<37 weeks), including one HUU
infant born at 36 weeks, and two HEU infants, born at 35 and 36 weeks
(Supplementary Table S3). There were no differences between HUU and
HEU infants for infant sex, gestational age or age at follow up at follow
up (Supplementary Table S3).

Food security and nutrients intakes among mothers living with and
without HIV
There were no differences between mothers living with and without HIV
for probability of reporting household food insecurity (Table 1). Mothers
living with HIV had higher intakes of Vitamin D (64.5 [42.0, 84.6] vs.
8.60 [0.38, 20.8], AdjP=0.95, p=0.002) and Se (51.7 [42.1, 73.7] vs. 12.6
[7.41, 34.4], AdjP=0.77, p<.001) compared to mothers living without
HIV (Table 1). There were no relationships between maternal HIV status
and DDS (Table 1). Full data on absolute nutrient intake levels for
mothers living with and without HIV from the 24-hour dietary recall are
presented Supplementary table 3.
Relationships between household food insecurity and diet quality
Mothers who worried about or experienced food runout consumed less
animal protein compared to those who did not (16.3 [3.85, 30.0] vs. 29.0
[19.3, 39.0], AdjP=0.49, p=0.03 [Table 2]; 15.4 [3.30, 21.4] vs. 29.0
[19.7, 38.0], AdjP=0.68, p=0.01 [Supplementary table S6]). Mothers who
experienced food runout consumed less saturated fatty acids (FA)than
mothers who did not (6.80 [5.69, 12.9] vs. 9.68 [8.88, 14.7], AdjP=0.07,
p=0.03 [Supplementary table S6]). Mothers who worried about food
runout consumed lower levels of added sugars (8.00 [0.50, 18.8] vs. 25.6
[12.0, 41.0], AdjP=0.11, p=0.01 [Table 2]) and glucose (1.80 [0.00, 3.55]
vs. 3.95 [2.40, 5.00], AdjP=0.19, p=0.04 [Table 2]) compared to those
who did not, and mothers who experienced food runout (Supplementary
table S6) consumed less fructose (0.40 [0.00, 6.10] vs. 6.50 [1.20, 8.15],
AdjP=0.16, p=0.01), sucrose (8.40 [1.00, 17.9] vs. 19.1 [12.4, 30.1],
AdjP=0.05, p=0.03), glucose (1.20 [0.00, 3.40] vs. 3.95 [2.75, 5.60],
AdjP=0.39, p=0.01), added sugars (8.00 [0.30, 21.0] vs. 17.6 [12.0, 40.5],
AdjP=0.05, p=0.04) total sugars (13.1 [7.00, 30.9] vs. 31.2 [24.3, 42.5],
AdjP=0.07, p=0.02) and dietary insoluble fibre (1.20 [0.00, 3.20] vs. 3.15
[1.68, 4.08], AdjP=0.18, p=0.04). Overall, very few mothers had intake
of vitamins or minerals that was too high, however, TULs were exceeded
for magnesium and sodium (Table 2). There were no relationships
between reports of household food insecurity and DDS (Table 2,
Supplementary table S6).
Overall, a large proportion of mothers were at risk of inadequate intake
of macronutrients, vitamins and minerals (Figure 2). Food insecurity was
associated with an increased risk of inadequate intake (median %EAR
met) of vitamin B12 amongst mothers who reported experiencing (66.7
[12.5, 91.7] vs. 89.6 [67.7, 144], AdjP=0.20, p=0.01 [Supplementary
figure S1]) food runout, or an inability to afford balanced meals (66.7
[19.8, 96.9] vs. 108 [70.8, 150], AdjP=0.05, p=0.04 [Supplementary
figure S2]) compared to mothers who did not. Of the mothers who
reported worrying about or experiencing food runout, or inability to
afford balanced meals, 76.5%, 86.7%, and 81.8% were at risk for
inadequate intake, respectively.
Influence of food insecurity on infant Apgar scores and growth
outcomes at birth
Maternal reports of food insecurity did not influence infant gestational
age at birth (Supplementary Table S4). However, infants who were from
households where mothers reported worrying about food runout
(compared to those who had not worried) had higher BBR at birth (10.4
[9.70, 12.0] vs. 9.65 [8.90, 10.3], AdjP=0.40, p=0.04, Figure 3A).
Maternal reports of food insecurity (worry about or experience food
runout, or inability to afford balanced meals compared to those who did
not experience these circumstances) were not associated with any other
infant anthropometry at birth (Supplementary Table S4).

Data from mother-infant dyads that attended follow up are presented as median (IQR) and p values are from univariate
analysis (Kruskal-Wallis/Wilcoxon test for non-parametric data; ANOVA for normal data with equal variance). Dietary
diversity score was calculated using nine food groups, only counting each food groups once (refs). Percent intake of TULs
and EARs were calculated using the Institute of Medicine’s TULs for minerals and vitamins for lactating women 14-18, 1930 or 31-50 years of age [26]. Iodised salt was assumed to be consumed by all mothers, as the majority of salt consumed in
South Africa is iodised [64]. TULs = Tolerable upper levels; EARs = Estimated average requirements.

Figure 1. Feeding patterns from birth to 8 weeks postpartum in HUU and HEU infants. There were no differences in the
likelihood of being exclusively breastfed (EBF) at 12 weeks of age for HUU (n=10) compared to HEU (n=21) infants ([p>0.05],
Fisher’s exact 2-Tail). Data on feeding practices were available for the whole cohort from birth to 8 weeks postpartum. Each
point on the line represents the proportion (%) of HUU or HEU exclusively breastfed, receiving any breastmilk, or were formula
fed at that time (weeks). HUU = HIV-unexposed, uninfected infant; HEU = HIV-exposed, uninfected infant.

food runout (compared to not worrying). Maternal reports of food insecurity did not associate with intake levels of macronutrients, vitamins or minerals.
Many women, irrespective of food security reports, are at risk of inadequate macronutrient, vitamin and mineral intakes. Percent intake of EARs for nutrients
were calculated for lactating women 14-18, 19-30 or 31-50 years of age [26]. No EARs are available for total fat. Calculations for EAR for total protein
considered maternal weight at time of dietary recall. Data are % intake of EAR reported in maternal dietary recall for macronutrients (quartiles, median

Figure 3. Maternal reports of worrying about food runout affect infant growth and neurodevelopment at birth and 12 weeks of age, and
cooccurrence of maternal HIV and food insecurity increases risk of stunting at birth. Maternal reports of worrying about food insecurity (compared
to not worrying) associate with higher brain-to-body weight ratio at birth (A; AdjP=0.40, p=0.04), lower Apgar score at five minutes postpartum (B;
AdjP=0.55, p=0.001), and attainment of fewer large movement (C; AdjP=0.44, p=0.03) and play activity (D; AdjP=0.58, p=0.02) milestones. Amongst
infants whose mothers report worrying about food runout, risk of stunting at birth is greater for HEU compared to HUU infants (E; p=0.04, Fisher’s exact
test). The red line represents the proportion of infants who had stunting at birth or 12 weeks PP. Outlier box plots are measured anthropometry, Apgar

Apgar scores at one minute were not impacted by maternal reports of
food security; however, Apgar scores at five minutes were slightly, but
not notably, lower for infants whose mothers reported sometimes or often
worrying about food runout (compared to those who never worried; 9.00
[9.00, 9.00] vs. 10.0 [9.00, 10.0], AdjP=0.55, p=0.02 [Figure 3B]). There
were no differences in infant Apgar scores at one and five minutes, or
trajectory of scores between one and five minutes, for HUU and HEU
infants whose mothers reported food insecurity compared those who did
not (Supplementary Figure 4).
Influence of food insecurity on growth outcomes in 12 week old infants
There were no differences for infant head circumference, weight, BMI,
or length in infants aged 12 weeks, or weight gain from birth to 12 weeks
postpartum in relation to measures of food security (Supplementary
Table S4).
HEU may increase vulnerability to effects of food insecurity on risk of
stunting at birth
Among infants whose mothers reported worrying about food runout,
HEU infants had increased risk of stunting at birth compared to HUU
infants (p=0.04, Fisher’s exact test [2-tail] [Figure 3E]). Maternal HIV
status did not influence the relationship between maternal reports of food
insecurity and any other infant outcomes at birth or 12 weeks postpartum.
Influence of food insecurity on neurodevelopmental outcomes in 12
week old infants
All but one infant, who was HUU, received a GMCD assessment at their
follow up appointment. Maternal reports of worrying about food runout
(compared to not worrying) associated with attainment of fewer large
movement (4.00 [3.00, 4.00] vs. 4.00 [4.00, 4.00], AdjP=0.44, p=0.03
[Supplementary Table S4]) and play activities milestones (2.00 [1.00,
2.00] vs. 2.00 [2.00, 2.00], AdjP=0.58, p=0.02 [Supplementary Table
S4]). The number of expressive or receptive language, fine movement, or
relating and response behaviour milestones attained in infants aged 12
weeks was not affected by maternal reports of food insecurity
(Supplementary Table S4).
The probability of attaining all 1-3 month GMCD expressive and
receptive language, large movement, play activities and relating and
response behaviour milestones did not associate with maternal reports of
household food insecurity (Supplementary figure S5A, C, E). No
comparisons were made for fine movement outcomes between infants
exposed to food insecure conditions compare to those who were not, as
all infants who were 1-3 months of age at follow up met all ageappropriate fine movement milestones. At 3-5 months, there were no
differences in the proportion of infants who attained fine movement and
relating and response behaviour milestones based on maternal reports of
food security (Supplementary figure S5B, D, F). No comparisons were
made for expressive and receptive language, large movement, or play
activities, as all infants 3-5 months of age at follow up had met these
milestones. It was not possible to further stratify these comparisons based
on maternal HIV status due to our small sample size.

Discussion
As infectious disease and malnutrition often coexist, it is critical to
understand how food insecure circumstances and maternal malnutrition
influence the developmental trajectories of the increasing number of
children born each year who are HIV-exposed, but uninfected. Amongst
children infected with HIV, the cooccurrence of malnutrition is known to
exacerbate the disease’s adverse effects, and associates with poorer
White et al. | medRχiv | September 12th 2019 |

prognosis [30]. HIV-infection has a definite impact on growth and
neurodevelopmental outcomes of children [6–9], and malnutrition, which
alone positions children to be more vulnerable to more frequent and
severe infections [31], may have an additive negative effect on growth
and health trajectories [32].
In this small pilot feasibility study, exploratory analyses found that HEU
infants exposed to household food insecurity had increased risk of
stunting at birth compared to HUU infants whose mothers also reported
food insecure conditions, suggesting that HEU infants may be more
vulnerable to the programming effects of suboptimal nutrition in utero
and postnatally than their HUU counterparts. Stunting is the most
common manifestation of infant undernutrition globally [33], increasing
morbidity and mortality in children in early life, and increasing one’s risk
of metabolic disease while reducing neurodevelopmental and economic
capacity later in life [34]. Stunting is common amongst children living
with HIV who are under 5 years and improves overtime with ART
treatment [35], however, the extent to which HEU children are
persistently at risk for stunting is not well understood. In our cohort, there
were 11 infants who were stunted at birth, and five who were stunted at
12 weeks postpartum. When examining stunting by HIV exposure
groups, we observed that amongst infants whose mothers worried about
food runout, HEU infants were at an increased risk of stunting compared
to HUU infants at birth, but not at follow up. This finding suggests that
the effects of in utero HIV exposure and food insecurity on infant length
at birth may not persist at 12 weeks postpartum, and infants with low
length-for-age at birth may catch up in growth in the first few months of
age. Of note, the number of HUU infants 12 weeks of age in our cohort
was small, and as such, comparisons between groups should be
interpreted with caution. Our findings should be replicated in larger
cohorts to determine whether HEU infants exposed to food insecure
conditions are indeed more vulnerable to stunting than their HUU
counterparts, and whether or not these infants may exhibit catch up
growth, an effect known to associate with poor metabolic and
cardiovascular outcomes later in life [36].
Suboptimal maternal nutrition during the prenatal period is also known
to associate with asymmetric IUGR and brain sparing [23], resulting in a
higher BBR at birth and increasing a child’s risk of motor hyperactivity,
and poorer language, cognitive, and motor outcomes at 10 years of age
[37], stunted immune functioning [38,39] and increased risk of metabolic
disease later in life [40]. We found higher BBR at birth amongst infants
whose mothers reported food insecure conditions, consistent with reports
of associations between maternal malnutrition and brain sparing [23].
Maternal HIV infection is also implicated as a risk factor for IUGR [41],
however, risk of asymmetric IUGR and brain sparing for infants exposed
to HIV in utero is not well characterised, and we found no differences in
BBR between HUU and HEU infants exposed to food insecure conditions
versus not. This suggests that HEU infants in this cohort were not at an
increased risk of brain sparing. To our knowledge, this is the first study
to use a measure of BBR to look at differential risk of brain sparing
among HUU and HEU infants exposed to suboptimal maternal nutrition
in utero and postnatally, and larger cohort studies with higher power
should further investigate these relationships.
The detrimental impacts of maternal malnutrition on infant
neurodevelopment are well established [42], and whilst children
perinatally infected with HIV have lower Apgar scores [43], and show
poorer motor, cognitive and behavioural development compared to
uninfected counterparts as early as 3 months of age [6–9], the
neurodevelopmental trajectories of HEU children are poorly understood
in part because studies often vary greatly in design, measurement tools,
10

cohort demographics, and findings [13,14,44–47]. Here, we observed
slightly lower Apgar scores at five minutes amongst infants whose
mothers reported worrying about or experiencing food runout,
irrespective whether or not the infant was HUU or HEU. Importantly,
these differences were small with low power, and their clinical relevance
is unlikely. We also found associations between maternal reports of food
insecurity and attainment of play activities and large movement
milestones in infants aged 12 weeks, irrespective of maternal HIV status.
Further, both HUU and HEU infants 1-3 months of age whose mothers
reported food insecure conditions did not meet GMCD 1-3 months
milestones for receptive language, large movement, relating and response
behaviour or play activities. This is in contrast to HUU and HEU infants
aged 3-5 months who met all 3-5 month GMCD neurodevelopmental
milestones (except for fine movement), irrespective of household food
security status. In disagreement with our hypothesis, these findings
suggest that the effects of household food insecurity, possibly resulting
in maternal malnutrition, on neurodevelopment were not exacerbated by
exposure to HIV in the womb. These data also suggest that whilst food
insecure circumstances influence neurodevelopmental milestone
attainment in infants who are 1-3 months of age, effects of food insecurity
on GMCD milestones may not persist beyond 2 months. As the absence
of effect at 3-5 months may be owing to our small sample size and low
power, further study in a larger cohort and more longitudinal data are
required to determine how infant development may change overtime in
response to household food insecurity.
Maternal nutrient intakes during pregnancy and the postpartum period are
critical to supporting rapid growth and development of the infant [1], and
maternal diet in part determines the nutritional composition of breastmilk
[48]. Differences in maternal nutrient intakes between mothers living
with and without HIV were minimal, and mothers were at risk for
inadequate macronutrient intakes irrespective of food insecurity reports,
and mothers experiencing food insecurity consumed less animal protein,
sugars and insoluble fibre, and more saturated FA. We also found
maternal reports of experiencing food insecurity associated with lower
vitamin B12, and a large proportion of mothers, irrespective of food
insecurity circumstances, were at risk for inadequate intakes. Inadequate
maternal vitamin B12 intakes have shown to cause secondary
deficiencies in breastfed infants in the first six months of life, leading to
delayed growth and neurodevelopment [49]. Iron intake was not
influenced by food insecurity, and it is promising that most mothers
exceeded EARs, but not TULs, for iron, which may be the result of public
health efforts to prevent and treat anaemia in pregnant women in South
Africa. Early detection of maternal nutrient deficiencies allows early
intervention and potential mitigation of adverse pregnancy outcomes and
long-term developmental impacts for infants who are breastfed, and these
preliminary results suggest that food insecurity may influence maternal
nutrient status. Importantly, our single dietary recall prevented us from
determining whether these deficiencies may have persisted long term or
are small fluctuations, limiting our ability to infer the degree they may
have secondary consequences for the mother and developing infant.
As ART coverage and viral suppression for pregnant women living with
HIV has increased, recommendations around postnatal feeding practices
have evolved to promote breastfeeding for women living with HIV
exclusively for the first 6 months postpartum [50], with continuation of
breastfeeding through mixed feeds thereafter until 24 months postpartum
[51]. Breastfeeding benefits include increased child cognitive scores,
decreased risk of contraction of common childhood infections, and
decreased rates of overweight and diabetes in later life [52]. We observed
slightly higher retention of EBF amongst mothers living without HIV
compared to those living with HIV. Food insecurity is a known barrier to
White et al. | medRχiv | September 12th 2019 |

exclusive breastfeeding [53], and mothers experiencing food insecurity
may be more likely to return to work soon after birth [54], or may have
challenges maintaining milk supply due to inadequate nutrition [55]. In
agreement with this, we found that mothers who never experienced food
runout or were always able to afford balanced meals were more likely to
be exclusively breastfeeding at follow up. Our short follow up time and
small sample size limited our ability to examine the effect of exclusive
breastfeeding duration on infant outcomes. Yet, infant growth and
neurodevelopment from birth to 12 postpartum did not appear to be
influenced by exclusive breastfeeding status at 12 weeks postpartum.
Further, whilst it is known that altered maternal endocrine and metabolic
status can restructure the breast milk microbiome and immune and
nutrient factors therein [56,57], how maternal HIV infection may alter
breastmilk composition is not well understood. Investigation of
breastmilk immune factors among women living with HIV remains
limited, and among the few studies that have measured these factors,
varied results have been reported. Higher levels of non-specific IgA [58]
and IgG [58,59] have been measured in breastmilk from women living
with HIV, and higher levels of fucosylated human milk oligosaccharides
in breast milk are associated with lower infant mortality among HEU
infants, but not HEI, during breastfeeding [60]. There is opportunity to
better understand how the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding, including
improved maternal health outcomes [61] and constituents in breastmilk
[62], could be protective against any adverse effects of exposure to HIV
in the womb on child growth and neurodevelopment.
Whilst our study’s small sample size and limited longitudinal data
restricts the generalisability of our findings and the power of our
analyses, we were successful in recruiting women to study the
cooccurring effects of food insecurity and in utero HIV exposure on
maternal dietary intakes and infant outcomes at two time points, and we
are now conducting a larger prospective pregnancy and birth cohort study
at Kalafong Hospital where we will further investigate relationships that
have emerged in exploratory pilot study analyses. There was loss to
follow up in this cohort, which may have resulted in sample bias at follow
up. While multiple attempts were made to contact mothers whom missed
follow up appointments, this population is highly mobile and study
participant retention remains difficult. To our knowledge, this
prospective cohort study is amongst the first few investigating
relationships between maternal nutrition and food security and infant
growth and neurodevelopment among a population of HIV-exposed,
uninfected infants in comparison to HIV-unexposed controls.
Overall, our findings suggest that food insecurities, and the likely ensuing
poor maternal nutritional status, adversely affect the growth and
neurodevelopment of a South African cohort of HUU and HEU infants
in the first four months of life, and at least for some measures, the effects
of a suboptimal early life nutritional environment may be most
detrimental for infants exposed to HIV in the womb. The perinatal
window is a key period to target to improve infant developmental
outcomes. Whether interventions that focus on maternal/child nutritional
status and food security at this time improve outcomes for the 1.5 million
HIV-exposed infants born annually, who may be even more vulnerable
to the programming effects suboptimal nutrition in utero and postnatally
[63], remains to be determined.

Supplementary figure S1. Maternal intake of estimated average requirements for macronutrients, vitamins and minerals for mothers who report
experiencing food runout (compared to not). Maternal reports of food insecurity did not associate with intake levels of macronutrients or minerals.
Maternal reports of experiencing food runout associated with lower intake of vitamin B12 [B; AdjP=0.20, p=0.01]). Many women, irrespective of food
security reports, are at risk of inadequate macronutrient, vitamin and mineral intakes. Percent intake of EARs for nutrients were calculated for lactating
women 14-18, 19-30 or 31-50 years of age [26]. No EARs are available for total fat. Calculations for EAR for total protein considered maternal weight at
time of dietary recall. Data are % intake of EAR reported in maternal dietary recall for macronutrients (quartiles, median lines and 95% confidence
diamonds, *p<0.05 [ANOVA for normal distribution/equal variance; Kruskal-Wallis/Wilcoxon test for non-parametric data; or Welch’s test for normal
data/unequal variance]). CHO = carbohydrates.

Supplementary figure S2. Maternal intake of estimated average requirements for macronutrients, vitamins and minerals for mothers who report
inability to afford balanced meals (compared to not). Maternal reports of food insecurity did not associate with intake levels of macronutrients or
minerals. Maternal reports of inability to afford balanced meals associated with lower intake of vitamin B12 (C; AdjP=0.05, p=0.04). Many women,
irrespective of food security reports, are at risk of inadequate macronutrient, vitamin and mineral intakes. Percent intake of EARs for nutrients were
calculated for lactating women 14-18, 19-30 or 31-50 years of age [26]. No EARs are available for total fat. Calculations for EAR for total protein considered
maternal weight at time of dietary recall. Data are % intake of EAR reported in maternal dietary recall for macronutrients (quartiles, median lines and 95%

GMCD international
standardisation sample

Supplementary figure S5. Food insecurity associates with low attainment of GMCD milestones for HUU and HEU infants. Infants whose mothers
reported household food insecurity did not attain 1-3 month GMCD milestones (A, C, E) for receptive language, large movement, relating and response
behaviour or play activities, or 3-5 month GMCD milestones (B, D, F) for fine movement or relating and response behaviour in the same proportion as the
international standardization sample. Maternal reports of food insecurity did not associate with risk of not attaining all 1-3 month or 3-5 month GMCD
milestones (A-F, [p>0.05], Fisher’s exact 2-Tail). Data are proportion (%) of infants who attained all age-appropriate GMCD milestones. The horizontal
dotted line represents the GMCD standardised international sample proportion (85%) of infants who attained all milestones in that age category, when
they were in that age range. The numbers underneath the bars represent the number of infants attaining all milestones for each milestone. GMCD = Guide
for monitoring child development; HUU = HIV-unexposed, uninfected infant; HEU = HIV-exposed, uninfected infant.

Boxes marked ‘x’ indicate that the variable was included in the final model, and covariates shaded grey were not considered as potential confounders for the respective
outcome variable. We considered infant CCR2 expression on total monocytes a potential confounding variable, as increased monocyte activation in infants has been
associated with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes in the first two years of life [65], and increased CCR2 expression on CD14+ monocytes is a known risk factor for
increased neuro-inflammation and disorder in in adults with HIV [66]. BBR = brain-to-body weight ratio.

Data from mother-infant dyads that attended follow up are presented as median (IQR) and p values are from
univariate analysis (Kruskal-Wallis/Wilcoxon test for non-parametric data; ANOVA for normal data with equal
variance). Iodised salt was assumed to be consumed by all mothers, as the majority of salt consumed in South
Africa is iodised [64].
