Abstract

49
50

Background: Circulating blood lipids cause coronary heart disease (CHD). However, the

51

precise way in which one or more lipoprotein lipid-related entities account for this

52

relationship remains unclear. We sought to explore the causal relationships of blood

53

lipid traits with risk of CHD using multivariable Mendelian randomization.

54
55

Methods: We conducted GWAS of circulating blood lipid traits in UK Biobank (up to

56

n=440,546) for LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B to identify lipid-

57

associated SNPs. Using data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D for CHD (consisting of 60,801

58

cases and 123,504 controls), we performed univariable and multivariable Mendelian

59

randomization (MR) analyses. Similar analyses were conducted for HDL cholesterol and

60

apolipoprotein A-I.

61
62

Findings: GWAS identified multiple independent SNPs associated at P<5x10-8 for LDL

63

cholesterol (220), apolipoprotein B (n=255), triglycerides (440), HDL cholesterol (534)

64

and apolipoprotein AI (440). Between 56-93% of SNPs identified for each lipid trait had

65

not been previously reported in large-scale GWAS. Almost half (46%) of these SNPs were

66

associated at P<5x10-8 with more than one lipid related trait. Assessed individually using

67

MR, each of LDL cholesterol (OR 1.66 per 1 standard deviation higher trait; 95%CI: 1.49;

68

1.86; P=2.4x10-19), triglycerides (OR 1.34; 95%CI: 1.25, 1.44; P=9.1x10-16) and

69

apolipoprotein B (OR 1.73; 95%CI: 1.56, 1.91; P=1.5x10-25) had effect estimates

consistent with a higher risk of CHD. In multivariable MR, only apolipoprotein B (OR

71

1.92; 95%CI: 1.31, 2.81; P=7.5x10-4) retained a robust effect with the estimate for LDL

72

cholesterol (OR 0.85; 95%CI: 0.57; 1.27; P=0.44) reversing and that of triglycerides (OR

73

1.12; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.23; P=0.01) becoming markedly weaker.

74

Individual MR analyses showed a 1-SD higher HDL-C (OR 0.80; 95%CI: 0.75, 0.86;

75

P=1.7x10-10) and apolipoprotein A-I (OR 0.83; 95%CI: 0.77, 0.89; P=1.0x10-6) to lower the

76

risk of CHD but these effect estimates weakened to include the null on accounting for

77

apolipoprotein B.

78
79

Conclusions: Apolipoprotein B is of fundamental causal relevance in the aetiology of

80

CHD, and underlies the relationship of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides with CHD.

Introduction

83
84

There is incontrovertible evidence that lipids play a causal role in the aetiology of

85

coronary heart disease (CHD) [1-3]. Multiple large-scale randomized trials of lipid

86

modifying therapies have conclusively shown that lowering of cholesterol in atherogenic

87

lipoproteins leads to a reduction in risk of CHD[4, 5]. These findings have been

88

recapitulated in human genetic studies using genetic variants robustly associated with

89

low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol [6-9].

90
91

Each circulating atherogenic lipoprotein particle includes one apolipoprotein B particle

92

but the amount of cholesterol (especially in LDL particles) and the amount of

93

triglycerides (especially in very low-density lipoprotein particles) can vary extensively

94

between lipoprotein particles[10]. Thus, while the concentration of LDL cholesterol and

95

triglycerides quantifies the concentration of these lipid substances in the blood, they do

96

not precisely quantify the number of atherogenic lipoproteins; in contrast, the

97

concentration of apolipoprotein B particles is directly proportional to the number of

98

circulating atherogenic particles in the blood. Evidence from human genetics supports a

99

causal role of LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B in CHD[11-13]. While it

100

is plausible that each lipid-related entity does individually play a causal role, it is also

101

feasible that one trait predominates. Elucidating the comparative role of blood lipids in

102

the aetiology of CHD has important repercussions not only in terms of a clearer

103

understanding of the underlying pathophysiology, but also in terms of which

104

biomarker(s) should be the focus of lipid-modifying therapeutics and might have more

105

application in the clinical setting.

106
107

Disentangling the relationships of atherogenic lipoprotein lipids and risk of CHD is non-

108

trivial, given the correlated nature of these traits. One such approach is to take genetic

109

variants that associate with more than one lipid trait and scale the CHD associations for

110

a given difference in lipid, in an attempt to identify which one or more traits appears to

111

have a consistent effect on risk of CHD. However, such an approach makes use of

112

indirect extrapolations and might be liable to biases, such as differential measurement

113

error in the lipid traits. Another approach is to use Mendelian randomization (MR), a

114

genetic approach that can facilitate an assessment of causality under certain

115

assumptions.[14] Conventionally, MR involves the analysis of individual exposure to

116

outcome relationships. A recently-developed extension to MR, so-called multivariable

117

MR, permits the appraisal of multiple risk factors simultaneously. By including the

118

genetic associations for multiple exposures in the same model, multivariable MR can

119

elucidate which traits retain a causal relationship with an outcome of interest, through

120

the genetic interrogation of potential confounders[15].

121
122

In this study, we sought to use human genetics to disentangle which one or more of the

123

atherogenic lipid-related traits (apolipoprotein B, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides) is

124

the underlying causal risk factor for CHD. We first conducted de novo GWAS of lipid-

125

related traits using the UK Biobank to identify variants robustly associated with each

126

trait. We then conducted MR analyses, including multivariable MR, to elucidate which of

127

the atherogenic lipid traits cause CHD. Finally, we investigated whether the entity

128

underlying the causal role of atherogenic lipid-related traits in CHD also accounted for

129

the ‘cardioprotective’ association of HDL related phenotypes.

Methods

132
133

Data sources

134

We used data from the UK Biobank (UKBB) under application #15825 and summary

135

estimates from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D [16]. All individual participant data used in this

136

study were obtained from the UK Biobank study who have obtained ethics approval

137

from the Research Ethics Committee (REC - approval number: 11/NW/0382). All

138

participants enrolled in UK Biobank have signed consent forms.

139
140

Data handling

141

Lipid-related traits in the UK Biobank were standardized/normalized using inverse rank-

142

normalization such that the mean was 0 and standard deviation was 1, allowing

143

comparison of effect estimates between traits.

144
145

GWAS of lipid-related traits

146

We identified SNPs associated with each of the lipid-related traits using the BOLT-LMM

147

software[17]. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex and a binary variable denoting the

148

genotyping chip individuals were allocated to in UKBB. Population stratification and

149

relatedness was accounted for using a mixed model after excluding individuals of non-

150

European descent based on k-means clustering (k=4). Further details on genotyping

151

quality control, phasing, imputation and association testing have been reported

152

previously[18, 19]. We assigned a SNP as associated with a lipid-related trait of interest

153

through use of a conventional GWAS threshold (P<5x10-8) and SNPs were binned into

154

loci based on pair-wise LD (r2<0.001), with the SNP with the strongest association with

155

the trait of interest (as defined by P value) being retained in each locus. We defined

156

novel SNPs as those associated with the trait of interest at P<5x10-8 in our analyses

157

where an association had not been previously reported at P<5x10-8, within 1MB and at

158

r2<0.001, by the Global Lipids Genetics Consortium[20] (for LDL cholesterol,

159

triglycerides and HDL cholesterol) or by Kettunen et al[21] (for apolipoprotein B or

160

apolipoprotein A-I).

161
162

Synthesis and characterization of genetic instruments

163

SNPs associating with lipid related traits at conventional GWAS thresholds (P<5x10-8)

164

were taken forward to generate genetic instruments for each phenotype. We

165

characterized the genetic instruments in several ways. First, to characterize the

166

‘specificity’ of individual SNPs included in each genetic instrument, we elucidated how

167

many SNPs associated with traits other than the primary lipid trait of interest at

168

conventional GWAS thresholds of significance (P<5x10-8) and used this information to

169

generate a Venn diagram. Second, we characterize instrument ‘specificity’ by taking per-

170

allele SNP estimates from our GWAS for each lipid trait and conducting inverse variance

171

weighted regressions on these summary estimates to elucidate the association of

172

genetic instruments across the various lipid related traits – these estimates are

173

presented as standardized differences per 1-standard deviation (SD) higher genetically-

174

predicted trait. While we recognize that this approach may be prone to inflation, the

175

primary motivation is to characterize the associations of lipid instruments with the lipid-

176

related traits: we do not interpret these as formal instrumental variable estimates.

177
178

Genetic analyses to elucidate causality

179

We first conducted univariable Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses for each lipid-

180

related trait. For this, we harmonized SNPs identified from our GWASs of blood lipids in

181

UK Biobank to those SNPs available in CARDIoGRAMplusC4D by either matching the SNP

182

directly, or by selecting proxy SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (r2>0.8). This led to a

183

small drop in the number of SNPs being available for MR, with a median of 93% SNPs

184

identified in GWAS available for MR (the numbers available for each trait are provided in

185

Table 1). We used the inverse variance weighted approach which, in brief takes the

186

form of a linear regression of the SNP-outcome association regressed on the SNP-

187

exposure association weighted by the inverse of the square of the standard error of the

188

SNP-outcome association, with the intercept constrained at the origin. We additionally

189

conducted univariable MR analyses using weighted median [22], weighted mode [23]

190

and MR-Egger [24] approaches.

191
192

We next conducted multivariable MR, which is a statistical approach that allows for the

193

association of SNPs with multiple phenotypes to be incorporated into the analysis

194

permitting an estimation of the direct effect of each phenotype on the outcome(i.e. an

195

effect which is not mediated by any other factor in the model[15]) see Supplementary

196

Figure 1 for further details. In this manuscript, we use the term 'adjusted' in the context

197

of multivariable MR to mean 'direct' effects, i.e. the effect of a lipid trait on CHD while

198

accounting for either mediation or confounding by another trait included in the model.

199

For the multivariable MR analyses, we fitted a model with apolipoprotein B, LDL

200

cholesterol and triglycerides to identify which one or more traits was responsible for the

201

effect of “atherogenic” lipid-related traits on risk of CHD. We then took the atherogenic

202

trait(s) that retained an effect on CHD in the multivariable MR model forward and

203

further adjusted for apolipoprotein A-I and HDL cholesterol to assess the causal effect of

204

HDL-related phenotypes with risk of CHD. In the setting of multivariable MR, we

205

included all GWAS associated SNPs for all traits in the model. This meant that there

206

were differing numbers of SNPs in the two multivariable models tested.

207
208

We characterized instrument strengths in both the univariable and multivariable MR

209

settings, as follows: for the univariable estimates, we generated the mean F-statistic,

210

using the approximation described by Bowden et al[25]. For the multivariable estimate,

211

we generated the conditional F-statistic [26].

212
213

Software

214

The BOLT-LMM software was used to undertake GWAS [17]. MR analyses were

215

conducted using the ‘TwoSampleMR’ R package[27]. Manhattan plots were generated

216

using the ‘ggplot2’ package[28].The Venn diagram was generated using the online tool

217

available at http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn [accessed 13th August

218

Analysis

221

While we desisted from dichotomizing results of analyses purely on the basis of a P-

222

value into being ‘significant’ or not[29], as a means of grading the strength of evidence

223

against the null hypothesis, in both the univariable and multivariable Mendelian

224

randomization analyses, we used a two-sided alpha of 0.01, on the basis of testing 5

225

lipid-related traits. Such a Bonferroni adjustment to account for multiple testing can be

226

considered overly conservative given the high correlation between the lipid related

227

traits.

Results

231

GWAS of blood lipid traits

232

The lipid traits were measured in 393,193 to 440,546 individuals with GWAS genotyping

233

(Table 1). On GWAS, we identified a large number of independent SNPs associated at

234

P<5x10-8 with each lipid related trait: 220 SNPs (of which 56% had not been previously

235

reported) associated with LDL cholesterol, 440 (77% novel) for triglycerides, 255 (80%

236

novel) for apolipoprotein B, 534 (72% novel) for HDL cholesterol and 440 (93% novel) for

237

apolipoprotein A-I (Figure 1 and Table 1). Full details of the SNPs associated with the

238

lipid-related traits are provided in Supplementary Tables 1-5.

239
240

A considerable number (477 out of a total 1044 clumped SNPs, i.e. 46%) of SNPs used in

241

each of the lipid-related genetic instruments showed associations at conventional GWAS

242

significance (P<5x10-8) with other lipid traits (Figure 2A). On exploring the relationships

243

of the genetic instruments with each lipid-related trait, we identified widespread

244

associations (Figure 2B). For example, in addition to its association with apolipoprotein

245

B, the genetic instrument for apolipoprotein B showed strong positive associations with

246

LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and inverse associations with HDL cholesterol and

247

apolipoprotein A-I.

250

On individual assessment through conventional MR, we identified LDL cholesterol,

251

triglycerides and apolipoprotein B to have effect estimates consistent with a higher risk

252

of CHD, using data from CARDIoGRAMplusC4D (with up to 60,801 cases) (Figure 3A). A

253

1-SD higher LDL cholesterol had an OR of 1.66 (95%CI: 1.49; 1.86; P=2.4x10-19) for CHD

254

with the corresponding value for triglycerides being (OR 1.34; 95%CI: 1.25, 1.44;

255

P=9.1x10-16) and apolipoprotein B (OR 1.73; 95%CI: 1.56, 1.91; P=1.5x10-25). Sensitivity

256

analyses using methodological approaches that take into account potential genetic

257

pleiotropy led to no substantive change in these estimates (Supplementary Figure 2).

258
259

When LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and apolipoprotein B were assessed together in

260

multivariable MR, only apolipoprotein B (OR 1.92; 95%CI: 1.31, 2.81; P=7.5x10-4)

261

retained a robust causal relationship with CHD (Figure 3A). The point estimate for LDL

262

cholesterol reversed on mutual adjustment, to yield an adjusted OR of 0.85 (95%CI:

263

0.57; 1.27; P=0.44). The estimate for triglycerides was weakened substantially (adjusted

264

OR 1.12; 95%CI: 1.02, 1.23; P=0.01).

265
266

Appraisal of HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I

267

Individual analysis using conventional MR showed both HDL cholesterol and

268

apolipoprotein A-I to have effect estimates consistent with a lower risk of CHD (Figure

269

3B). The estimate for a 1-SD higher HDL cholesterol was OR 0.80 (95%CI: 0.75, 0.86;

270

P=1.7x10-10) and for apolipoprotein A-I it was OR 0.83 (95%CI: 0.77, 0.89; P=9.96x10-7).

271

The effect estimates for both HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I were diminished

272

when using methodologies that are more robust to potential pleiotropy of the genetic

273

variants used in the analysis (Supplementary Figure 2).

274

On appraisal in a multivariable MR analysis that included apolipoprotein B (which

275

retained a causal relationship with CHD on mutual genetic adjustment for LDL

276

cholesterol and triglycerides), the effect estimates of both HDL cholesterol and

277

apolipoprotein A-I diminished and were not distinguishable from the null. (Figure 3B).

278

The adjusted estimate for HDL-C was OR 0.91 (95%CI: 0.74, 1.12; P=0.36) and for

279

apolipoprotein A-I it was OR 0.94 (95%CI: 0.76, 1.17; P=0.59). When adjusted for HDL

280

cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I, apolipoprotein B retained a robust causal effect on

281

CHD (adjusted OR 1.68; 95%CI: 1.54, 1.84; P=6.5x10-32).

Discussion

289
290

Our study provides strong evidence from human genetics that supports apolipoprotein

291

B being the underlying causal driver of the relationship of blood lipids and risk of CHD.

292

This adds further evidence to support the hypothesis that it is the number of

293

atherogenic lipoprotein particles, indexed by apolipoprotein B, rather than the amount

294

of circulating cholesterol or triglycerides, that is the important driver of CHD[30]. In

295

other words, changes in cholesterol or triglycerides that are not accompanied by

296

commensurate changes in apolipoprotein B are unlikely to lead to altered risks of CHD.

297
298
299

Our GWAS identified many hundreds of variants associated with the major lipid related

300

traits, with most SNPs identified being novel. Many SNPs identified for one lipid-related

301

trait also showed associations with other lipid traits, highlighting their pleiotropic

302

nature. Individual appraisal using univariable Mendelian randomization showed

303

widespread effects of all lipid-related traits, with LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and

304

apolipoprotein B each having effect estimates consistent with a higher risk of CHD.

305

These findings recapitulate those reported in previous studies [8, 9, 11, 12], leading to

306

the contemporary view that each atherogenic lipid trait might play a causal role in

307

vascular disease. When we estimated the direct (i.e. adjusted) effect of these traits

308

using multivariable MR (see Supplementary Figure 1 for further details), only

309

apolipoprotein B retained a robust causal effect with CHD, with the effect of LDL

310

cholesterol being reversed and that for triglycerides being largely diminished with only a

311

very weak residual effect. The apparent protective associations of HDL cholesterol and

312

apolipoprotein A-1, present on univariable MR analyses, were also markedly attenuated

313

when direct effects conditional on apolipoprotein B were estimated. Taken together,

314

these findings indicate that among the lipid related traits we investigated, it is

315

apolipoprotein B, and thus the number of atherogenic lipoprotein particles, that

316

predominates as the underlying cause of CHD.

317
318

How do these findings enhance the evidence-base relating to lipid traits and vascular

319

disease? Large-scale observational[31], interventional[4, 5] and genetic[6-9] studies

320

support LDL cholesterol as being causal in the aetiology of CHD. In recent years, genetic

321

studies have provided evidence in support of triglycerides[11, 12] also playing a causal

322

role. Both LDL cholesterol and triglycerides are carried in atherogenic lipoproteins, each

323

containing an apolipoprotein B particle. Recent narrative reviews[32] [33] point to

324

apolipoprotein B potentially being the necessary entity for atherosclerosis to occur, for

325

example, through the ‘response to retention’ hypothesis, in which apolipoprotein-B

326

containing particles become trapped in the tunica intima of the arterial wall[34] . Our

327

study builds on recent findings[30] to provide further empirical evidence that supports

328

this hypothesis, but our findings importantly do not discredit the causal roles that LDL

329

cholesterol or triglycerides play in vascular disease. This is because apolipoprotein B

330

does not occur in physiological circumstances in isolation[33], but rather is always

331

accompanied by cholesterol and triglycerides. In light of this, our findings pinpoint that

17

332

it is apolipoprotein B that is necessary in order for atherogenesis to occur. Indeed, our

333

findings from multivariable MR are consistent with apolipoprotein B being an essential

334

element allowing the atherogenic effects of LDL cholesterol and triglyceride to be

335

expressed.

336
337

How do these findings aid us in the context of developing drugs that modify blood lipid

338

concentrations and predicting their effects on risk of CHD? Drug-target Mendelian

339

randomization studies show that, for example, modifying triglycerides through therapies

340

such as ANGPLT3/4 inhibition may represent an emerging approach to lowering the risk

341

of CHD[35-37] – do our findings contradict these data? Not so: our findings shed light on

342

whether the concentrations of cholesterol and/or triglycerides that are carried by

343

apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins plays a role in CHD beyond that of

344

apolipoprotein B. Based on these and recent data [13, 30], the primary focus of lipid

345

modifying therapies ought to be the reduction in number of atherogenic lipoproteins (as

346

measured by apolipoprotein B) rather than the reduction in cholesterol or triglycerides.

347

This is especially the case where drugs have discrepant effects across these lipid

348

traits.[10] [38] [13] Thus in predicting the vascular effects of a lipid-modifying

349

therapeutic, apolipoprotein B can, all things being equal, be used as a reliable surrogate

350

marker for the relative risk reduction in CHD – assuming, of course, that the drug under

351

investigation does not display adverse events that arise either from target-mediated

352

mechanisms, or off-target effects (notably, both can be measured directly, or

353

extrapolated, from studies in human genetics[39]).

354
355

We note that this interpretation is in keeping with two important prior investigations

356

that examined the concordance of CHD associations between SNPs associated with

357

apolipoprotein B, LDL cholesterol[13] and triglycerides[30]. Indeed, one of these prior

358

investigations conducted a form of multivariable MR analysis and obtained similar

359

findings to those we report in the present study[30]. Importantly, the analysis that we

360

conducted and report herein builds on these prior investigations by including the full

361

repertoire of GWAS-associated SNPs for each of the lipid related traits (including a de

362

novo GWAS of apolipoprotein B): such a comprehensive representation of trait-

363

associated SNPs is necessary in order to reliably interpret the MR estimates for each of

364

the entities included in the multivariable MR analysis.

365
366

The findings that we make have been made available by two recent advances. First, the

367

availability of large-scale blood lipid phenotyping and GWAS genotyping in the UK

368

Biobank, providing sufficiently large numbers to permit identification of robust genetic

369

variants (and therefore suitable genetic instruments) in order to conduct MR of each of

370

the lipid-related traits. Use of a single study with similar numbers of individuals with

371

measures available for each lipid-related trait enabled GWAS and the downstream

372

synthesis of genetic instruments for each trait in which the genetic architecture of each

373

phenotype ought to be similarly represented, allowing for a more rigorous comparative

374

assessment of the traits in both the univariable and multivariable MR setting. Second,

375

methodological developments in MR to include more than one trait (so-called

19

376

multivariable MR) allows for “direct” effects (i.e. the effects of an exposure on disease,

377

taking into account potential confounding and mediation by other traits) of multiple

378

exposures to be assessed simultaneously and without the risk that this introduces forms

379

of bias (such as collider bias)[15]. It is this methodological approach that allows the

380

deduction that we make: that apolipoprotein B underlies the causal effects of lipid-

381

related traits with risk of CHD. We note here an important theme that emerges: the

382

discrepancy between our findings and those derived from other MR approaches that

383

hitherto have been used in contemporary MR studies (reflected by the univariable MR

384

estimates we present in Supplementary Figure 2). While other approaches such as MR-

385

Egger and weighted median MR can provide reliable tests of causation even in the

386

presence of confounding through unbalanced horizontal pleiotropy[40] (as evidenced by

387

the diminution of the HDL cholesterol association with risk of CHD on MR-Egger,

388

Supplementary Figure 2), such approaches notably do not, with a few exceptions [41,

389

42], allow simultaneous statistical adjustment for multiple traits. The repertoire of

390

univariable MR analyses that seek to act as sensitivity analyses for potential pleiotropy

391

each makes a different series of assumptions [22]. In the context that genetic

392

confounding affects the majority of SNPs used in the genetic instruments, and when

393

such confounding is present in a dose-response manner (i.e. on average, SNPs that

394

increase the exposure of interest also increase the confounder of interest), this violates

395

the ‘inSIDE’ assumption[24] and the MR analyses yield biased estimates. This is why the

396

MR estimates for LDL cholesterol and triglycerides remain seemingly robust to MR Egger

397

and weighted median MR approaches. In this context, multivariable MR analysis can

398

help when the traits included in the analysis account fully for the unbalanced, dose-

399

related, horizontal pleiotropy. In the scenario that we investigate, apolipoprotein B does

400

just so, permitting us to conclude that it is apolipoprotein B that is ultimately

401

responsible for the underlying causal relationship of blood lipids and risk of CHD.

402
403

In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that apolipoprotein B underlies the causal effect

404

of lipids on CHD and that it is the trait that is responsible for the associations of LDL

405

cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I with the risk of CHD.

* We defined novel SNPs as those associated with the trait of interest at P<5x10-8 where an
association had not been previously reported at P<5x10-8, within 1MB and at r2<0.001 by the
Global Lipids Genetics Consortium[20] (for LDL cholesterol, triglycerides and HDL cholesterol) or
by Kettunen et al[21] (for apolipoprotein B or apolipoprotein A-I).
^ The conditional F-statistic for apolipoprotein B when included in the multivariable MR model
with LDL cholesterol and triglycerides was 36, and in the multivariable MR model that included
HDL cholesterol and apolipoprotein A-I it was 66.

Legend: In Panel A, SNPs are grouped according to whether they associate with only the primary lipid-related trait of interest, or whether they
associate with other traits, based on P<5x10-8. Panel B displays the associations of genetic instruments with lipid related traits, using the inverse
variance weighting approach. While we note the potential for overfitting of estimates displayed in Panel B, we present these data for illustrative
purposes; the Mendelian randomization estimates presented in Figure 3 use a two-sample approach (with no overlapping data).
