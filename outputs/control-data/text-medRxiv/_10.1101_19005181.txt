Abstract
Objective─The goal of this study was to determine factors associated with cardiac memory
(CM) in patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD).
Methods─Patients with structural heart disease (n=20; mean age 72.6±11.6 y; 80% male;
mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 31.7±7.6%; history of myocardial infarction (MI)
in 75%, ventricular tachycardia (VT) in 85%) and preserved atrioventricular (AV) conduction
received primary (80%) or secondary (20%) prevention dual-chamber ICD. Standard 12-lead
ECG was recorded in AAI and DDD mode, before and after 7 days of right ventricular (RV)
pacing in DDD mode with short AV delay. Direction (azimuth and elevation) and magnitude of
spatial QRS, T, and ventricular gradient (SVG) vectors were measured before and after 7 days of
RV pacing. CM was quantified as the degree of alignment between QRSDDD-7 and TAAI-7 vectors
(QRSDDD-7-TAAI-7 angle). Circular statistics and mixed models with a random slope and intercept
were adjusted for days 1-7 change in cardiac activation, LVEF, known risk factors, and use of
medications known to affect CM.
Results─QRSDDD-7-TAAI-7 angle strongly correlated (circular r = - 0.972; P<0.0001) with
TAAI-7-TDDD-7 angle. In the mixed models, history of MI (-180°(95%CI -320° to -40°); P=0.011)
and female sex (-162°(95%CI -268° to -55°); P=0.003) counteracted CM-T azimuth changes
(+132°(95%CI 80°-184°); P<0.0001). History of VT (+27(95%CI 4-46) mV*ms; P=0.007)
amplified CM-T area increase (+15(95%CI 6–24) mV*ms; P<0.0001).
Conclusions─Existing cardiac remodeling affects CM in response to RV pacing. Women
develop less CM than men. Activation memory is another manifestation of CM.

Right ventricular (RV) apical pacing can cause pacing-induced cardiomyopathy1, 2: nearly
every fifth patient develops pacing-induced cardiomyopathy if RV pacing burden ≥20%3, 4.
Biventricular pacing and His bundle pacing5 are more physiological, but also more technically
challenging pacing approaches. An informed clinical decision regarding the choice of pacing
approach should be based on the evaluation of risks and benefits for each patient. Unfortunately,
it remains largely unknown which factors (besides pacing burden) are associated with pacinginduced cardiomyopathy.
RV pacing changes activation pathway and induces complex repolarization phenomenon of
cardiac memory (CM).6 CM is a form of cardiac remodeling caused by altered myocardial
stretch.7 Altered ventricular stretch and subsequent local cardiac angiotensin II release but not
altered ventricular activation initiates CM.8 The T wave changes of CM result from underlying
changes in ion channels (Ito, Ikr, ICa,L) and connexin43 remodeling.7 CM can be fully reversible
after return to normal activation pathway. All these facts suggest that the amount of CM
developed in response to RV pacing is likely associated with clinical outcomes. However, while
molecular mechanisms of CM have been extensively studied,6 its translation into clinical practice
has been limited.9 Current clinical perception of CM is restricted by recognition of T wave
inversion that develops after a period of altered ventricular activation once normal ventricular
activation is restored, differentiating CM from ischemic T wave inversion.10
Previously, CM was studied in patients undergoing pacemaker implantation.11-14 An
interaction of RV pacing-induced CM with preexisting cardiac remodeling [e.g. after myocardial
infarction (MI) and ventricular tachycardia (VT)] remains incompletely understood. The goal of
this study was to determine factors associated with CM in patients receiving implantable

Exclusion criteria were: (1) a history of unstable angina pectoris within the last 3 months
unless treated by coronary intervention; (2) inability to tolerate DDD pacing or AAI pacing due
to subjective discomfort, heart failure, or other reasons; (3) anti-tachycardia pacing or shock
therapy from ICD for spontaneous tachyarrhythmia episodes for the last 3 months; (4) more than
1% of RV pacing for the last 3 months (confirmed by the ICD device interrogation); (5) NYHA
class III-IV congestive heart failure; (6) left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) < 20%; (7)
baseline ECG abnormalities (complete left bundle branch block, T wave inversions secondary to
left ventricular hypertrophy) precluding expression of CM; (8) inaccessible for follow-up at the
study center.
ECG recording and pacing protocol: induction of cardiac memory
At the baseline study visit, resting supine 12 lead electrocardiogram (ECG) was recorded
using a MAC 5000 electrocardiograph (GE Marquette, Milwaukee, WI), in AAI and DDD mode
with a short AV delay at a rate 10% faster than presented sinus rhythm. Then, ICD devices were
programmed in the DDD mode with a short (100-120 ms) paced and sensed AV delay and lower
rate as clinically indicated.
The second study visit was conducted after seven days of ventricular pacing when ICD
devices were interrogated, and the percentage of ventricular pacing data was collected. During
the follow-up visit, resting 12-lead ECG was recorded first in DDD mode, and then in AAI
mode. The pacing rate during ECG recording on a follow-up visit maintained the same as at the
baseline ECG recording.
Measurement of cardiac memory on the body surface vectorcardiogram
The raw digital 12-lead ECG signal (sampling rate 500Hz, amplitude resolution 1µV) was
analyzed at OHSU. Kors matrix15 was used to transform the 12-lead ECG into orthogonal XYZ

ECG. All 10-second ECG recordings were reviewed, and all beats were manually labeled (LGT).
Ectopic beats, fusion beats, and artifact-distorted beats were excluded from the analysis. Four
types of median beats were constructed: AAI mode atrial-paced ventricular-sensed (APVS) beat
recorded on the study day one (AAI-1) and day seven (AAI-7), and DDD mode atrial-paced
ventricular-paced (APVP) beat recorded on the study day one (DDD-1) and day seven (DDD-7).
The heart vector origin point was identified as previously described.16 Fiducial points (QRS
onset and offset, and T offset) were automatically detected on a vector magnitude. Accuracy of
the origin point and fiducial point detection was verified using a visual aid (KTH, LGT). Spatial
peak and area QRS, T, and spatial ventricular gradient (SVG) vectors were defined as previously
described,17 and their direction (azimuth and elevation) and magnitude were measured. The
scalar value of SVG was measured by the sum absolute QRST integral (SAI QRST)18, 19 and QT
integral on vector magnitude signal (iVMQT).17
CM was quantified after seven days of ventricular pacing, as the degree of alignment
between VP QRS vector (QRSDDD-7) and VS T vector (TAAI-7), measured as QRSDDD-7-TAAI-7
angle. Changes in ventricular repolarization were assessed as TAAI-1-TAAI-7 and TDDD-1-TDDD-7, as
well as TAAI-1-TDDD-1 and TAAI-7-TDDD-7 angles.
The difference in ventricular activation between VS and VP QRS vectors was measured by
QRSAAI-7-QRSDDD-7 angle. To eliminate an error due to possible differences in ECG leads
placement between days one and seven, CM angles were measured on the same day recordings.
To assess a possible error due to ECG leads placement on two different days, we measured
spatial angles QRSDDD-1-QRSDDD-7 and QRSAAI-1-QRSAAI-7, and an agreement between angles
QRSAAI-7-QRSDDD-7 and QRSAAI-1-QRSDDD-1.

Ventricular pacing vector
On VCG, VP vector was defined as a median VP spike calculated on the 10-sec recording.
Statistical analyses
The distribution of all variables was evaluated. Normally distributed continuous variables
were presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). A paired t-test was used to compare normally
distributed VCG parameters at different pacing modes, at baseline and after seven days of
ventricular pacing.
Circular statistics were used to analyze circular variables (spatial angles, azimuth, and
elevation). To describe circular variable, mean circular direction and 95% confidence interval
(CI) were reported. Non-uniformity of the circular variable distribution was confirmed by the
Rayleigh test and the Kuiper test for all studied circular variables. A paired comparison of
circular variables was performed using the Hotelling's paired test. The circular-circular
correlation coefficients between two circular variables were calculated by the Fisher & Lee
method. The circular-linear correlation coefficients were calculated by the Fisher, Mardia & Jupp
method. The Watson U-square statistic and the Kuiper statistics were used for two-sample tests
for circular variables. To account for multiple testing in correlation analyses, the correlation was
considered statistically significant if the P-value was less than 0.001.
To determine associations of demographic and clinical characteristics with changes in T and
QRS vectors over the course of 7 days, we conducted longitudinal analysis and constructed two
sets of mixed models. One set of models was built to predict changes in direction and magnitude
of T area vector, separately in the AAI (VS) mode and DDD (VP) mode. Another set of models
was built to predict changes in the direction and magnitude of the QRS area vector in DDD (VP)
mode. As there was prominent person-to-person variability in QRS and T vector changes, we

constructed mixed models with a random slope and intercept. The Hausman specification test
confirmed the consistency of random effect estimates for all models. We used an unstructured
covariance structure. A likelihood ratio test confirmed a better model fit for a random slope, for
all models. To test our hypothesis that preexisted remodeling can affect the development of CM,
we constructed two models. Model 1 was adjusted for age, sex, and two major causes of
preexisted CM: a history of MI and VT. Model 2 was in addition adjusted for other known
factors affecting cardiac remodeling: LVEF, history of diabetes, hypertension, use of
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and
class III antiarrhythmic (AA) drugs. To adjust for possible unmeasured confounders (e.g. due to
differences in ECG leads location in days 1 and 7, or unmeasured disease-related factors), both
models 1 and 2 were adjusted for longitudinal change in corresponding QRS variable. Model of
T (and SVG) azimuth change was adjusted for QRS azimuth change. Model of T (and SVG)
elevation change was adjusted for QRS elevation change. The model of T area change was
adjusted for the QRS area change. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that T azimuth (and T
area) change during abnormal activation (in DDD mode) is associated with QRS azimuth (and
QRS area) change, adjusting for the same confounders in models 1 and 2. In mixed models, a P
value less than 0.05 was considered significant.
STATA MP 16 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX) and Oriana-Circular Statistics 4
(Kovach Computing Services, Pentraeth, Wales, UK) were used for statistical analyses.

Results
Study population
The clinical characteristics of the study participants are shown in Table 1. Most of the study
participants were men with ischemic cardiomyopathy and ICD implanted for primary prevention
of sudden cardiac death (SCD). Of note, 85% had a history of VT, and nearly half had a
sustained VT. The vast majority of participants were on beta-blockers and ACEi/ARBs, and onethird of participants received class III antiarrhythmic medications (sotalol or amiodarone).
During the seven study days, all study participants experienced constant RV pacing: the average
percentage of RV pacing was 99.73±0.23% (range 99.3-100%).
Development of cardiac memory
Mean CM angle (µ) was 67.5° (95%CI 47.6° – 87.4°); median 58.2°; length of mean vector r
was 0.727; concentration (κ) was 2.2; circular variance 0.27; circular SD 45.7°.
In paired comparison, there were no differences in RR’ interval across all four recordings
(Table 2). At baseline, in APVS AAI-1 beat, the QRS vector pointed to the left and slightly
backward, whereas the T vector pointed straight forward (indicating preceding remodeling),
resulting in a wide baseline QRS-T angle.
Ventricular pacing in day one (APVP DDD-1 beat) caused QT prolongation, QRS widening,
rotation of QRS vector further backward and up, rotation of T vector down and leftward, and
further widening of QRS-T angle. Notably, the direction of Wilson’s SVG vector did not change,
whereas its magnitude slightly increased. Magnitudes of QRS and T vectors and areas also
increased (Table 2).

After seven days of VP and return to normal activation (APVS AAI-7 beat), the QRS vector
returned to the same direction as in APVS AAI-1 beat. QT and QRS intervals, QRS-T angle, and
SVG magnitude in AAI-7 did not differ from AAI-1. As expected, CM on APVS beat
manifested by prominent T vector magnitude enlargement, increased SVG and SAI QRST, and
dramatic changes in T vector direction (turned sharply to the right and upward), and SVG vector
direction (turned upward and backward).
On the 7th day, we observed very similar differences between APVS and APVP beats (AAI-7
vs. DDD-7), as on the first study day. Neither magnitude nor direction of Wilson’s SVG differed
between APVS and APVP beats.
Comparison of APVP DDD-1 and DDD-7 beats revealed no differences in direction and
magnitude of the QRS vector, the direction of the T vector, and the QRS-T angle. However, the
direction of the SVG vector changed dramatically (turned upward and backward), and
magnitudes of T, SVG, and SAI QRST significantly decreased. The development of CM is
shown in Figure 1.
Baseline repolarization characteristics associated with cardiac memory
CM angle perfectly (r = - 0.972) correlated with TAAI-7-TDDD-7 angle that reflects difference in
repolarization in two different activation patterns after development of CM (Figure 2).
Correlations between CM (QRSDDD-7-TAAI-7) angle and TAAI-7-TAAI-7 (r = - 0.198), TDDD-1-TDDD-7
(r = - 0.081), and TAAI-1-TDDD-1 (r = - 0.373) angles was weak and non-significant.
TAAI-1-TAAI-7 angle negatively correlated with baseline TAAI-1 peak magnitude (r = - 0.738;
P<0.0001) and T AAI-1 area (r = - 0.720; P<0.0001), and positively correlated with T AAI-1
azimuth (Figure 2), both T AAI-1 peak azimuth (r = 0.623; P<0.0001) and T AAI-1 area azimuth (r

= - 0.692; P<0.0001; Figure 2).
Baseline characteristics associated with ventricular activation pattern during RV pacing
The difference in ventricular activation between VS and VP QRS vectors as measured by
QRSAAI-7-QRSDDD-7 angle was on average 77.4°; length of mean vector 0.927; median 82.6°
(95%CI 67.7° – 87.2°). In the paired analysis, there was no difference between QRSAAI-7QRSDDD-7 and QRSAAI-1-QRSDDD-1 angles. A possible error due to variations in ECG electrodes
placement was below 10 degrees. Mean QRSAAI-1-QRSAAI-7 angle was 7.5°; length of mean
vector 0.997; median 6.5° (95%CI 5.5°-9.5°). Mean QRSDDD-1-QRSDDD-7 angle was 9.6°; length
of mean vector 0.976; median 5.0 (95%CI 4.1°-15.1°).
We observed a significant correlation between baseline APVP (DDD-1) repolarization
characteristics and differences in ventricular activation in AAI and DDD mode after CM has
been developed, as measured by QRSAAI-7-QRSDDD-7 angle. Baseline APVP TDDD-1 azimuth
correlated with QRSAAI-7-QRSDDD-7 angle (r = 0.604; P<0.001; Figure 3), but not QRSAAI-1QRSDDD-1 angle (r = 0.355; NS). Baseline APVP QTDDD-1 interval was moderately strongly
correlated with APVP QRSDDD-7 azimuth (r = 0.623; P<0.001; Figure 3), whereas the correlation
of APVS QTAAI-1 interval with APVP QRSDDD-7 azimuth was weak (r = 0.436; P<0.05). Baseline
APVS TAAI-1 vector magnitude (r = 0.653) and TAAI-1 area (r = 0.601) positively correlated with
QRSDDD-7 vector elevation on the 7th day during ventricular pacing (Figure 3), but not in a
normal ventricular conduction (QRSAAI-7 vector elevation: r = 0.261 for TAAI-1 vector magnitude
and r = 0.333 for TAAI-1 area).

The direction of Ventricular Pacing vector
VP vector was directed upward and rightward, consistently with implanted RV lead. In the
paired analysis, there was no difference in VP vector azimuth recorded on day one versus day 7
(165°; (95%CI 157°-173°) vs. 173; (95%CI 157°-189°); P=0.099). VP vector elevation slightly
decreased by 10° one week after RV lead implantation: V DDD-1 elevation 110°; (95%CI 102°117°) vs. V DDD-7 elevation 100° (95%CI 91°-110°); P=0.006. There were no meaningful
correlations of VP vector direction with cardiac activation or repolarization metrics.
Clinical characteristics associated with cardiac memory
We observed prominent person-to-person variability in changes of T and SVG vectors that
manifest CM (Figure 4). Mixed models analyses results showed that in AAI mode, T azimuth
displayed the most dramatic changes from day 1 to day 7 (Table 3). History of MI and female
sex was associated with the significant opposite effect on T azimuth, counteracting the
development of CM. Change in T elevation was associated only with a change in QRS elevation,
but not any clinical or demographic characteristics. History of MI, history of VT, and history of
class III antiarrhythmics use was associated with T magnitude changes (Table 3). In DDD mode,
the history of VT was associated with changes in SVG azimuth during seven days of follow-up.
History of MI, VT, and female sex were associated with changes in SVG elevation, reducing the
degree of CM manifestation (Table 3). Similarly, female sex and VT history were associated
with T magnitude changes in DDD mode, offsetting the development of CM.
In an adjusted mixed model analysis, we detected changes in ventricular activation as a
manifestation of CM. In DDD mode, we observed significant changes in QRS azimuth and area,
from day 1 to day 7 (Table 4). Female sex and history of MI were associated with a reduction of
QRS azimuth changes, whereas diabetes and LVEF worsening were associated with greater QRS

azimuth changes. Similar associations were observed for the QRS area. In AAI mode, there were
no statistically significant changes in QRS vector direction and magnitude from day 1 to day 7.
Discussion
In this prospective study of CM in ICD patients, we observed several novel findings. First,
we showed that existing cardiac remodeling due to MI and VT significantly affects the degree of
CM in response to RV pacing. Secondly, we, for the first time, demonstrated sex differences in
CM development. After adjustment for the type of cardiomyopathy, degree of LV dysfunction,
use of medications, and major cardiovascular risk factors (hypertension and diabetes), women
developed less CM as compared to men. Thirdly, we noticed that in participants with preceded
cardiac remodeling, the CM is associated with significant changes in cardiac activation. While
repolarization memory “remembers” abnormal activation after baseline activation has been
restored, activation memory “remembers” normal baseline activation during abnormal (VP)
activation, resulting in a smaller angle between QRS vectors of normal (baseline) and abnormal
(VP) activation. Further studies of repolarization and activation memory are needed to
understand the mechanisms and clinical significance of CM.
Cardiac remodeling is associated with the degree of repolarization memory
We observed that the more abnormal baseline repolarization was, the less repolarization
memory had been developed in response to ventricular pacing. The wider the baseline spatial
QRS-T angle was, the less repolarization memory was developed. The larger baseline T area
was, the less repolarization memory was developed. Similarly, the more abnormal was the
direction of the baseline T vector, the less repolarization memory was developed. The abnormal
(rightward-forward) direction of T vector, large magnitude of T, and wide QRS-T angle are well-

known signs of earlier cardiac memory or cardiac remodeling. A more negative T vector azimuth
in CM patients with DDD RV pacing20 is consistent with our finding of less repolarization
memory with more negative T vector azimuth (Figure 2). Accordingly, in the mixed model
analyses adjusted for a change in cardiac activation between days 1 and 7, LV systolic function,
known risk factors, and use of medications known to affect the development of cardiac memory,
history of MI and VT strongly counteracted repolarization changes. History of MI and VT nearly
completely canceled manifestation of CM, both in AAI and DDD modes. Thus, the robust
development of typical CM in response to RV pacing suggests an absence or a minimal degree of
preexisted cardiac remodeling. In contrast, weak repolarization response to RV pacing implies
that repolarization ion channels in ventricular cardiomyocytes had been already remodeled, as
shown in many in vitro studies,7, 21, 22 and display a saturation of response. Our finding is
consistent with CM studies in HF patients undergoing bi-ventricular pacing.12, 13
Women develop less cardiac memory than men
Previous studies using animal models22-24 or human subjects,6, 9, 11 did not investigate sex
differences in CM. Interestingly, in our study, sex was strongly associated with the degree of CM
manifestation. In fully adjusted mixed models, female sex was strongly and independently
associated with a significantly smaller amount of CM, suggesting that women developed less
dyssynchrony in response to RV pacing, as compared to men. Female sex nearly completely
canceled manifestation of CM, both in AAI and DDD modes (Table 3). The finding of sex
differences in CM is novel and has an important clinical significance. It is well known that
women benefit from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) more than men.25 We speculate
that sex differences in CM contribute to sex differences in CRT response.

“Activation memory” is another manifestation of cardiac memory
A large number of previous studies described CM as a repolarization phenotype.6, 9, 11, 21, 24, 26
In this study, we, for the first time described the manifestation of activation memory. In addition
to repolarization memory, which manifests by the wide angle between T vectors in AAI and
DDD modes on the 7th day, activation memory is revealed by the narrow angle between QRS
vectors in AAI and DDD modes on the 7th day. Repolarization memory manifests by TAAI-7
vector aligning with abnormal activation vector; repolarization “remembers” abnormal
activation. In turn, activation memory manifests during continued abnormal activation, by
abnormal activation vector aligning with normal activation vector. Activation memory is likely a
compensatory mechanism attempting to minimize dyssynchrony developing in response to
sustained abnormal activation. Activation and repolarization are two phases of the repeated
cycle, following one after another. Development of repolarization memory affects refractoriness
in ventricles, which, in turn, affects the way how ventricles activate. Further studies of activation
memory mechanisms and its clinical significance are needed.
Spatial ventricular gradient reflects cardiac memory
Our results one more time27 confirmed Wilson’s ventricular gradient28 concept, suggesting
that the SVG is largely independent of the ventricular activation sequence (no difference
between SVGAAI-7 and SVGDDD-7).29, 30 SVG is determined by the heterogeneity in the whole area
under the action potential across the heart, rather than by heterogeneity in the action potential
duration alone.29-31 SVG vector tracked the development of CM better than the T vector (Table
2), especially in DDD mode. Thus, change in SVG direction can be used to assess CM in
persistently abnormal activation (during continuous ventricular pacing, bundle branch block).

Model 1 was adjusted by corresponding QRS variable, age, sex, history of MI, and history of VT. Model 2 was in addition adjusted by LVEF, history of diabetes, hypertension,
VT, use of ACEi/ARBs, and class III antiarrhythmic (AA) drugs. Corresponding QRS variable for each model: area QRS azimuth for area T azimuth and area SVG azimuth, area
QRS elevation for area T elevation and area SVG elevation, QRS area for T area models.

Model 1 (M1) was adjusted for corresponding T variable, age, sex, history of MI, and history
of VT. Model 2 (M2) was in addition adjusted for LVEF, history of diabetes, hypertension, VT,
use of ACEi/ARBs, and class III antiarrhythmic (AA) drugs. Corresponding T variable for each
model: area T azimuth for area QRS azimuth, T area for QRS area models.
