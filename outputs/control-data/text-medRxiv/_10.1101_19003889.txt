Abstract
HIV-infected infants show altered growth, brain development, and immune function. Yet, it remains unclear how detrimental fetal
exposure to maternal HIV infection is to the development of the uninfected infant. A pilot study was conducted at Kalafong
Hospital in Pretoria, South Africa, to better understand how maternal HIV infection influences infant outcomes. We hypothesised
that in utero HIV-exposed, uninfected (HEU) infants would have poorer postnatal development and altered innate immune
composition compared to HIV-unexposed, uninfected infants (HUU). Infant growth, neurodevelopment (Guide for Monitoring
Child Development [GMCD]) and levels of monocyte subsets (CD14, CD16, and CCR2 expression [flow cytometry]) were
measured in infants at birth and 12-weeks. HEU infants had lower head circumference and elevated CCR2+ (% and median
fluorescence intensity) on monocytes at birth compared to HUU. Most infants met GMCD milestones at 1-3 and 3-5 months. Our
findings that HEU infants had reduced head circumference and increased levels of migratory monocytes at birth, which has been
associated with poor motor and cognitive outcomes, is consistent with our motor results within 5 months of age. Elevated levels of
migratory monocytes may initiate pro-inflammatory pathways that target the brain, impacting neurodevelopment and lifelong
health.

Introduction
Maternal HIV infection profoundly affects maternal physiology and
pregnancy outcomes. Annually, ~1.3 million women living with HIV
become pregnant (1,2), and HIV infection in pregnancy is associated with
increased risk of experiencing an adverse pregnancy outcome (3)
including preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm birth,
urinary tract infection, post-partum sepsis and infection, and maternal
mortality (4,5). Importantly, pregnancy and the postpartum period are
two key times when HIV exposure may also have lasting impact on the
fetus and infant. For example, fundamental structures, such as the brain,
undergo rapid development in utero, and are thus vulnerable to infectious
challenges such as HIV and antiretroviral therapy (ART) (6). Infants
exposed to HIV in utero and during breastfeeding, who themselves
become infected (HEI), have increased risk of intrauterine growth
restriction (IUGR) (4,5), low birthweight (3), compromised immune
function (7) and increased susceptibility to subsequent infections (8–10).
These infants also show poorer motor, cognitive, language (11,12) and
behavioural (12) outcomes compared to uninfected infants, and reduced

weight-for-length, length-for-age (13) and head circumference-for-age
(14) in the first two years of life.
Importantly, global coverage of ART is increasing, reaching 80% of
pregnant and breastfeeding women living with HIV in 2017 (15). As a
result, mother-to-child HIV transmission is declining (16), and the
population of HIV-exposed (in utero and during breastfeeding) but
uninfected (HEU) infants is rising. This is true in South Africa, which
faces the largest burden of HIV globally, with 19% of the world’s HIVinfected population and nearly 4 million women of reproductive age who
are living with HIV residing in South Africa (17). Nevertheless, this
challenge has compelled the development of the largest HIV treatment
programme worldwide (17), and in 2017, more than 95% of women who
were pregnant and living with HIV in South Africa had access to ART
(17). An estimated 30% of pregnant women in South Africa are HIVinfected and the rate of mother-to-child-transmission has been shown to
be below 2% at birth (18). Despite this progress, the extent to which HIV
exposure in utero or during breastfeeding, without infant infection,

influences infant development is poorly understood, and it remains
unclear how development in HEU infants and children is shaped by
inflammatory and metabolic abnormalities, intestinal dysbiosis (19) and
persistently high risk of preterm birth (20) experienced by pregnant
women living with HIV.
In HIV-infected adults, markers of monocyte activation and altered
frequencies of monocyte subsets are among some of the best predictors
of non-AIDS associated co-morbid diseases (21,22). These alterations
have been implicated in the development of HIV-associated
neurocognitive decline (22), and associate with increased neuro- and
peripheral inflammation (23,24). Perinatally-infected HEI infants have
increased monocyte activation between 4-15 weeks postpartum (25)
relative to HEU infants, however, it is less clear whether the distribution
of monocyte subsets and if their migratory potential is altered in HEU
infants compared to HIV-unexposed, uninfected (HUU) infants, and if
these alterations in HEU explain some of the adverse
neurodevelopmental and growth outcomes in these infants.
We conducted a prospective cohort pilot study in Pretoria, South Africa,
to determine if we could recruit women through our clinics to study the
effects of HEU on growth, immune- and neuro-development in infants in
early life, and to advance our knowledge on these exposure-outcome
relationships. We hypothesised that poor growth and neurodevelopment
and alterations in monocyte subsets would occur in HEU infants to a
greater degree than HUU infants.

Methods
Study population
Women living with and without HIV were recruited after delivery (HIV-infected:
n=32, HIV-uninfected: n=22) from the obstetric unit at Kalafong Provincial
Tertiary Hospital and followed-up at one timepoint 12 weeks (range 8-16 weeks)
postpartum (HIV-infected: n=21, HIV-uninfected: n=10). Study recruitment took
place between June and December 2016. By March 2017, all follow up data had
been collected. This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the
Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Pretoria (185-2016) and the
Carleton University Research Ethics Board (108870).

Recruitment and eligibility
Eligible women were identified by a research nurse after delivery. Exclusion
criteria included caesarean section delivery, pregnancy complications (including
gestational diabetes mellitus, multiple gestations), or antibiotic exposure
perinatally.

Data collection
After delivery, a retrospective medical chart review was conducted to extract
antenatal data. This included maternal characteristics (age at conception, parity,
gravidity, smoking status, weight during pregnancy); medication use during
pregnancy (including antibiotic exposure); illness/infections during pregnancy;
and pregnancy outcomes (gestation length). All HIV-exposed infants underwent a
blood draw at birth and again at 12 weeks for HIV testing. Blood from this routine
draw was obtained within 4 days of birth and used to quantify the surface markers
CD14, CD16 and CCR2 for monocyte subset identification (26).
At the postpartum follow up visit, mothers completed a questionnaire to assess
breastfeeding practices, maternal lifestyle factors (including alcohol and
smoking), and nutrition (including vitamin supplements, food security, and a 24hour dietary recall). If any visits to clinics or hospitals occurred between birth and
the follow up visit, the patient-retained child health record (Road to Health Booklet
(27)) of the infant was examined to extract data on infant weight, history of illness
and medication use.

Outcome measures
Primary outcomes of interest were infant anthropometry at birth and 12 weeks
postpartum, weight gain from birth to 12 weeks postpartum, Apgar score at one
and five minutes, developmental outcomes (Guide for Monitoring Child

White et al. | medRχiv | September 6th 2019 |

Development (28)) at 12 weeks postpartum, and monocyte levels at birth and 12
weeks postpartum (CD14 expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells [total
monocytes]), CD16 expression on CD14+ monocytes (monocyte subsets) and
CCR2 expression on all monocyte populations.
Infant anthropometry
Infant weight, length, and abdominal and head circumference were measured at
birth and 12 weeks postpartum. Infant anthropometry were age- and sexstandardised using World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards (WHO
Anthro software [v 3.2.2, January 2011]) (29). A brain weight estimate was
calculated using an equation derived by the National Institute of Neurological and
Communicative Disorders and Stroke’s Collaborative Perinatal Project (30):
brain weight (g) = 0.037 x head circumference (cm)2.57

[30]

The brain weight estimate was used to calculate the infant brain-to-body weight
ratio (BBR) (31):
BBR = 100 x (brain weight estimate [g])/(birth weight [g])

[31]

Weight gain from birth to 12 weeks postpartum (kg/day) was calculated using the
weight of an infant at birth and follow up, and the days alive since birth at follow
up:

Infant monocyte subsets
Using the Gallios flow cytometer (3 laser, 10 colour configuration; Beckman
Coulter, Miami, FL, USA), CD14 expression on PBMCs and CD16 and CCR2
expression (% and median fluorescence intensity [MFI]) on monocyte subsets was
evaluated within four days of birth and at 12 weeks of age. The Kaluza V1.0
Acquisition software (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA) was used for data
acquisition and post-acquisition data analysis was performed using Kaluza
Analysis software (Version V3.1; Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA). FlowCheck Pro fluorosphere were acquired daily prior to sample analysis to ensure
optimal laser alignment and instrument performance. Single colour staining tubes
(i.e. sample stained with individual monoclonal antibodies) were used to setup the
protocol and calculate the colour compensation values. After setup and
protocol/template verification, the instrument settings (voltages, gains, threshold
and colour compensation settings) were kept the same throughout the study. The
reagent list, including lasers and detectors used, and compensation matrix are
presented in Supplementary tables S1 and S2, and the analysis approach and gating
strategy are described in Supplementary figures S1 and S2. Classical
(CD14++CD16−), intermediate (CD14++CD16+) and non-classical (CD14+CD16+)
monocyte subsets were identified (32).
Infant neurodevelopment
The Guide for Monitoring Child Development (GMCD) (28) assesses expressive
and receptive language, play activities, relating and response behaviour, and fine
and large movement. The GMCD was developed for use in low- and middleincome countries to assess infants from 1 to 24 months postpartum, and involves
the researcher asking the child’s caregiver a series of open-ended questions
relating to the child’s development. An assessment for each infant was carried out
once between 8-16 weeks postpartum. Infants who were 1-3 months of age (1
month to 2 months and 30 days) were assessed on milestones listed in the 1-3
month category, and infants who were 3-5 months (3 months+1 day to 4
months+30 days) were assessed for milestones listed in both the 1-3 and 3-5 month
columns. Infants who were premature (<37 weeks) were age-corrected to term.
The GMCD has been standardised and validated for international use in a sample
of approximately 12,000 children from 4 diverse countries, namely South Africa,
Argentina, India and Turkey (33).

Statistical analyses
Data were analysed using JMP 14.0. After data were tested for normality,
univariate analysis (ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis/Wilcoxon test for non-parametric
data, or Welch’s test normal data with unequal variance) and adjusted multiple
regression models were used to compare: 1. infant anthropometry at birth and 12
weeks postpartum, 2. Apgar scores (one and five minutes), 3. levels of total
monocytes, monocyte subsets and CCR2 expression assessed within 4 days of
birth and at 12 weeks postpartum and 4. GMCD milestones attained at 12 weeks
postpartum between HEU and HUU infants. Fisher’s exact test was used to test
associations between infant HIV-exposure status (HUU compared to HEU) and
probability that an infant had attained all age-appropriate milestones for expressive

and receptive language, fine and large movement, relating and response behaviour
and play activities (compared to not having attained all milestones).
Variables that are known or suspected confounders for our outcome measures were
included as covariables in regression models, and through stepwise backward
elimination, variables with a=0.20 were retained in the final models
(Supplementary Table S3). These included maternal age, education, weight at
delivery, gravidity, parity, tobacco exposure, breastfeeding practices and selfreports of food (in)security, and infant gestational age, sex, and age (days) at
follow up, and growth outcomes. CCR2 expression on total monocytes was
considered a potential confounding variable, as CCR2 expression on CD14+
monocytes is a known contributor to neuro-inflammation and disorder in in adults
with HIV (24), and increased monocyte activation in infants has been associated
with poorer neurodevelopmental outcomes in the first two years of life (34).
Outliers were excluded where measurement error was clear, including for one
participant for %CCR2-positive classical monocytes at birth, and one for %CCR2positive non-classical monocytes at 12 weeks. With the pilot study’s small sample
size in consideration, we used an adjusted retrospective power (AdjP) calculation
to determine the probability that the any effects of HEU on infant outcomes found
during analyses were true with 80% certainty (AdjP>0.80). Data for infant
outcomes below are presented as unadjusted means (SD) or medians (IQR) with
adjusted retrospective power (AdjP) and p value from ANCOVA.
Infant outcomes for the GMCD were quantified in 2 ways. First, the total number
of milestones attained by each infant, regardless of whether they were 1-3 or 3-5
months of age at follow up, was quantified for expressive and receptive language,
play activities, relating and response behaviour, and fine and large movement.
Next, the proportion of infants having attained all milestones (compared to not
having attained all milestones) in their age category (1-3 months, or 3-5 months)
for expressive and receptive language, fine and large movement, play activities
and relating/response behaviour was quantified (35). Fisher’s exact test was used
to test differences in probability of HUU compared to HEU infants having attained
all age-appropriate neurodevelopmental milestones at 1-3 months. Fisher’s exact
test was not performed to test differences in probability of HUU compared to HEU
infants attaining milestones 3-5-month milestones, as only one of the 10 HUU
infants who attended follow up (out of 22 recruited at birth) was 3-5 months of
age.
To determine whether or not the study cohort at follow up was representative of
the cohort at birth, standard least squares regression analysis compared all
outcomes at birth for infants who were, versus were not, present at follow up,
within the HEU and HUU infant groups. Data below that compares outcomes in
infants who were lost to follow up to those who were not are presented as
unadjusted means (SD) or medians (IQR) and p values.

Results
Cohort characteristics
At follow-up, 31 mother-infant dyads (HIV-infected: n=21, HIVuninfected: n=10) of the 55 who had been recruited after delivery (HIVinfected: n=32, HIV-uninfected: n=22) were in attendance. There were
no differences in maternal characteristics within our cohort (Table 1) or
pregnancy outcomes such as gravidity, parity, or weight at delivery. All
mothers identified as non-cigarette smokers, however, one woman
reported consuming snuff.
Infant outcomes at birth
Birth outcomes, anthropometric measures and Apgar scores

Infant cohort characteristics are presented in Table 2. Preterm birth (<37
weeks) occurred in 5/54 (9.26%) pregnancies. Two preterm infants were
HUU, born at 36 and 35 weeks, and three were HEU, with two born at
36 weeks, and one at 35 weeks (Table 2). HEU infants had lower head
circumference-for-age z-scores (-1.58 ± 1.22 vs. -0.33 ± 1.19,
AdjP=0.92, p<0.001) and BBR (9.60 [8.88, 10.4] vs. 10.2 [9.77, 11.3],
AdjP=0.43, p=0.04) at birth (Figure 1D, 1E, Table 2). BMI, length-forage and weight-for-age z-scores at birth did not differ between HEU and
HUU infants (Figure 1A-C, Table 2). There were no differences between
HEU vs. HUU for Apgar scores at one minute or five minutes (Figure 1F,
Table 2).

Immune measures

There were no differences between HEU and HUU infants in the relative
frequency of total monocytes (% CD14+ PBMC), monocyte subsets, or
on CCR2 expression by total monocytes or mean monocyte subsets
(Table 2). HEU infants had elevated %CCR2-positive classical
monocytes (97.4 [95.2, 98.4] vs. 94.7 [92.2, 97.2], AdjP=0.71, p=0.01;
Figure 2A, Table 2) at birth. No significant differences were observed for
intermediate - or non-classical monocytes between the two groups at birth
(Figure 2B, C). Median fluorescence intensity (MFI) is indicative of the
level of cell surface expression and a significant higher CCR2 MFI were
observed for classical (6.29 [5.59, 6.81] vs. 5.25 [4.49, 6.63], AdjP=0.50,
p=0.03; Figure 2D) and intermediate (2.87 [2.34, 3.48] vs. 2.33 [2.16,
2.65], AdjP=0.46, p=0.03; Figure 2E) at birth in HEU infants when
compared to HUU infants. No significant differences in CCR2 expression
levels were observed in non-classical monocytes at birth in HEU
compared to HUU infants (Figure 2F, Table 2).
Infant outcomes at 12 weeks postpartum
Anthropometric measures

In adjusted analyses, there were no differences between the age- and sexstandardised anthropometric measures of HEU and HUU infants at
follow up, and no differences in weight gain from birth to 12 weeks
postpartum (Figure 1A-F, Table 2).
Immune measures

There were no differences between HUU and HEU infants at 12 weeks
postpartum for %CD14+ PMBCs, CCR2 expression by total monocytes,
or classical, intermediate, or non-classical monocyte sub-population
levels (Table 2). HEU infants had elevated %CCR2-positive intermediate
monocytes compared to HUU infants at 12 weeks postpartum (56.2 ±
12.2 vs. 44.8 ± 23.1, AdjP=0.39 p=0.05; Figure 2B), but no differences
for %CCR2 on classical or non-classical, or CCR2 MFI on all monocyte
subsets were observed (Figure 2A, C, D-F, Table 2).

Figure 1. Effect of in utero HIV-exposure on Apgar, infant anthropometry and attainment of neurodevelopmental milestones. (A-E) Infant
anthropometry at birth and 12 weeks and (F) Apgar at one and five minutes postpartum. (G) GMCD at 1-3 months. (H) GMCD at 3-5 months. HEU
infants (n=32) have lower head circumference Z-score at birth (AdjP=, p=0.005) and BBR (AdjP=, p=0.04) compared to HUU infants (n=22). There were
no other differences between HUU and HEU infants for anthropometry at birth or 12 weeks of age. There was no difference in the proportion of HUU (n=8)
compared to HEU (n=14) infants who attained GMCD milestones at 1-3 months of age ([p>0.05], Fisher’s exact), and no comparisons between HUU and
HEU infants were made for 3-5 month milestones met, given that only 1/10 HUU infants at follow up (of the 22 recruited at birth) was 3-5 months of age.
All infants met milestones when comparing to the GMCD standardisation sample, except for HUU infants for 1-3 month receptive language, large
movement, and play activities milestones, and HEU infants for fine movement milestones at 3-5 months of age. Bar graphs are proportion (%) attaining all
age-appropriate GMCD milestones. Outlier box plots are measured anthropometry and Apgar scores (quartiles, median lines and 95% confidence
diamonds, *p<0.05 [ANCOVA]). GMCD = Guide for monitoring child development; HUU = HIV-unexposed, uninfected; HEU = HIV-exposed, uninfected;

intermediate monocytes compared to HUU infants (B; AdjP=, p=0.05). Data are measured as proportion of monocyte sub-populations expressing
CCR2 (%) and the average (median) levels of expression per cell (MFI) on monocyte subpopulations. Outlier box plots are quartiles, median lines

GMCD

The percentage of infants in each group (HUU compared to HEU) who
had achieved all age-appropriate milestones at 1-3 or 3-5 months
postpartum are presented (Figure 1). One HUU infant did not undergo a
GMCD developmental assessment at follow up. 23/31 (74.19%) of
infants aged 8-16 weeks had a 1-3 month GMCD assessment. Of these
infants, 15/23 (65.2%) were HEU. At 1-3 months, HUU infants had
attained age-appropriate milestones for receptive language, large
movement and play activity milestones in lower proportions (-10.0%, 10.0%, and -22.5%, respectively) than the GMCD international
standardised sample (Figure 1G). HEU infants who were 1-3 months of
age had attained all age-appropriate milestones for 1-3 months
postpartum. We found no association between HIV-exposure group and
probability of attaining all age-appropriate milestones (compared to not
attaining) in any GMCD neurodevelopmental theme at 1-3 months
(Fisher’s exact).

White et al. | medRχiv | September 6th 2019 |

A 3-5-month assessment was performed on the 8/31 (25.8%) infants at
follow up who were within this age range. Of these infants, 7/8 (87.5%)
were HEU. Fewer HEU infants who were 3-5 months of age had attained
age-appropriate fine movement milestones in comparison to the GMCD
international standardised sample (14.3% of HEU attained vs. 85%
standardised sample, Figure 1H). The one HUU infant who was 3-5
months attained all developmental milestones. HEU infants who were 35 months of age had attained all age-appropriate milestones for
expressive language, receptive language, large movement and play
activities, and met the international standardised sample proportion for
relating and response behaviour (+0.70%). All HUU and HEU infants
who were 3-5 months had attained all 1-3 month milestones for all
themes, consistent with the GMCD international standardised sample.
Multiple variable regression analysis revealed no differences between all
HEU and HUU infants for the number of GMCD milestones attained in
infants at 12 weeks postpartum (Table 2).

Data are presented means ± SD (ANOVA) or median (IQR; Kruskal-Wallis/Wilcoxon test for non-parametric data, or Welch’s test for normal data/unequal
variance) with p values from unadjusted univariate analyses and adjusted multiple variable regression models. Differences infant sex and <37 GA
proportions for HUU vs. HEU infants were assessed by Fisher’s exact test. aAll infant anthropometric measures are standardised according to WHO child
growth standards (29).
Differences between the cohort at birth and 12 weeks postpartum

Attrition was higher for HUU (54.5%) than HEU (34.4%) infants. Within
the HUU infant group, infants who were not lost to follow up had
significantly lower BMI at birth than those who were lost to follow up (1.32 ± 2.47 vs. 0.90 ± 1.85, p=0.03). There were no other differences for
anthropometric, Apgar scores or immune measures at birth within the
HUU or HEU infant groups, when comparing infant who were versus
were not at follow up.
.

Discussion
As access to ART increases worldwide and the number of HEU children
born each year also rises, there is growing need to understand how, and
to what extent, exposure to HIV and ART in utero influences infant
health trajectories. In this study, HEU infants had reduced head
circumference and elevated CCR2 expression by CD14+ monocytes
within 4 days of birth compared to HUU infants, and attained fine
movement milestones at 3-5 months of age in lower proportions than the
GMCD standardised proportions. These findings are largely consistent
with our hypothesis that although uninfected themselves, infants whose
mothers are HIV-infected and on ARTs may experience poorer health
outcomes compared to HIV-unexposed, uninfected infants.
Reduced head circumference (14), weight, and length (13) at birth is welldocumented in HEI infants relative to HEU and HUU infants. Studies
investigating anthropometry in HEU infants at birth are revealing that
HEU infants may also be at risk for lower birthweight, length, BMI
(36,37) and head circumference (14) at birth relative to HUU infants, not
unlike, but to a lesser degree than, HEI infants. Our finding that HEU
infants had lower head circumference than HUU at birth is consistent
with these studies, although in our cohort head circumference was not
different between groups in adjusted analyses at follow up. These
findings are important because small head circumference at birth has

White et al. | medRχiv | September 6th 2019 |

been shown to associate with poorer performance on neurodevelopmental
assessments in school-aged children, including on cognitive tasks
measuring memory and visuo-spatial ability (38), early adiposity rebound
and increased risk for adult obesity (39,40), cardiovascular disease
mortality (41), and mental health disorders such as schizophrenia (42). It
is not known whether, in the context of maternal HIV infection, small
head circumference at birth is linked to persistent deficits in
neurodevelopment and/or, in the longer term, later life brain and
metabolic compromise. Our findings should be interpreted cautiously
given our small sample size and limited power, but suggest that future
studies should investigate whether these outcomes at birth may have
predictive value for developmental trajectories of HEU infants.
Brain-to-body weight ratio was calculated to determine whether HEU
may associate with increased risk of IUGR in comparison to HUU
infants. Higher BBR may associate with brain sparing and IUGR (31),
which are linked to shorter attention span, motor hyperactivity, and
poorer performance on measures of language, cognitive, and motor
outcomes at 10 years of age compared to infants who were not IUGR
(43). IUGR infants also have stunted immune functioning (44,45) and
increased risk of metabolic disease later in life (46). Our findings of
higher BBR among HUU infants at birth in comparison to HEU may have
been influenced by our small sample size and/or may suggest that within
this population, exposure to HIV and ART in the womb did not increase
infant susceptibility to IUGR or brain sparing in HEU. To our knowledge,
this is the first study to use a measure of BBR in a HEU population. The
decrease in BBR ratio seen in both groups from birth to 12 weeks
postpartum is consistent with growth trajectories in early child
development, where the rate of change for body size is higher than the
rate of change for brain size (47).
Elevated blood monocytes in HEI infants have been associated with
poorer neurologic outcomes and increased risk of HIV-associated
progressive encephalopathy (48), however, our study found no

7

differences in %CD14+ total monocytes or monocyte subset levels
between HEU and HUU infants at birth or at follow up, suggesting that
these same changes in total monocyte composition are not experienced
by HEU infants. We also found increased CCR2 expression on classical
monocytes at birth and intermediate monocytes at 12 weeks, and
increased levels of CCR2 expression (MFI) on classical and intermediate
monocytes in HEU infants at birth. Increased in CCR2 expression may
result in increased recruitment of monocyte populations across the blood
brain barrier, which may have consequences for neurodevelopment, as
the expression of CCR2 by CD14+ monocytes has been shown to
associate with HIV-1 induced neuropsychological impairment and
neuroinflammation in adults (24,49). The expression and release of a
CCR2 ligand, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), from
astrocytes in the brain is increased by HIV-1 infection (50). MCP-1 levels
have been shown to positively correlate with severity of HIV-induced
neuropsychological impairment in adults (51). Importantly, whether or
not elevated MCP-1 levels, or CCR2 expression by monocyte subsets as
observed in the HEU infants in this cohort, may have consequences for
children prenatally exposed to HIV remains to be determined. The
clinical importance of the subtle differences in monocyte phenotypes
observed in our cohort remains unclear, and larger studies should
replicate these findings to determine whether or not these will persist
throughout development.
There are well-documented, positive associations between proinflammatory perinatal exposures and adverse motor outcomes (52–54),
in both animal (52,53) and human studies (54), consistent with the
potential differences in monocyte migratory potential among HEU
children, and the low proportion of HEU children attaining fine
movement milestones at 3-5 months of age in this study. Prenatal
exposures to maternal inflammation also influence the development of
the infant’s innate and adaptive immune systems (55), and the resulting
alterations in infant immune function may have consequences for brain
development. In our study, most infants met all GMCD milestones. Just
one of seven HEU infants met fine movement milestones at 3-5 months
(compared to the single HUU infant who met these milestones at 3-5
months), however, given our short follow up window and low power, we
cannot determine whether this finding could be generalised to a larger
cohort, and future studies with large sample size should include repeated
measures of neurodevelopmental milestones across infancy and
childhood to better understand the longer term impact of HIV exposure
without infection on neurodevelopment. Previous studies investigating
fine motor outcomes in HEU infants compared to HUU have reported
mixed results, with some observing lower scores among HEU infants
(56,57) and others reporting no differences (56,58). Notably, these
studies were conducted across a wide range of geographical locations and
varied in their measurement tools, cohort demographics, and study
design, therefor direct comparisons should be made with caution.
In this pilot feasibility study attrition was high, particularly among the
HUU infant population, and HUU infants who came for follow up had
significantly lower BMI at birth than those for who were lost to follow
up. It may be that the HUU population we saw at follow up represented
babies who had poorer health, and as such, mothers may have been more
likely to attend the follow up appointment if they had any concern about
their infant’s well-being, resulting in sample bias. We did not expect to
observe a low proportion of HUU infants attaining milestones for
receptive language, large movement and play activity milestones in
comparison to the GMCD international standardised sample, and we
hypothesise that these findings have been influenced by a biased sample
of HUU infants at follow up who had poorer health. Despite BMI
differences in HUU lost to follow up and not, there were no other

White et al. | medRχiv | September 6th 2019 |

differences within HUU or HEU infant groups when stratifying by follow
up (versus not), suggesting that the sample bias may be minimal.
There are many variables that have the potential to influence the
phenotype of the HEU fetus and child, thus the mechanisms linking HIV
exposure in the womb with poor offspring development in utero and after
birth remain unresolved. For example, there is a need to better understand
how the placenta, which minimises adverse exposures from reaching the
fetus and promotes fetal growth and development through nutrient
transfer, adapts to maternal HIV infection. Pro-inflammatory and
infectious molecules in pregnancy can target the placenta, affecting its
development and function, and changes in placental morphology,
histopathology, and inflammatory response to adverse pregnancy
environments have been associated with offspring neurodevelopmental
outcomes (59). Further, the influence of the early nutritional
environment, including food (in)security and maternal nutrition, on
health outcomes in HEU children has not been well characterised. HIV
infection is known to increase a household’s risk of food insecurity by
decreasing household productivity and economic capacity (60,61), and in
turn, food insecurity is linked to reduced ART access and poorer ART
adherence (62,63). Malnutrition may exacerbate maternal
immunosuppression related to HIV infection and adversely interact with
ART pharmacokinetics (64,65), and the comorbidity of these exposures
for infants in utero may be more detrimental than the occurrence of one
of these particular circumstances. Moreover, as ART coverage and viral
suppression for pregnant women has increased, recommendations around
postnatal feeding practices have evolved to promote exclusive
breastfeeding for HIV-positive women (66). Whether, and to what extent,
the benefits of exclusive breastfeeding and constituents in breast milk
may protect against suboptimal development in HEU infants, has not
been studied comprehensively. Prospective analyses will evaluate the
influence of food (in)security, maternal nutrition, and breastfeeding on
these outcomes in this infant population.
Although the translatability of our findings is limited by our study’s small
sample size and short follow up time point, we were successful in our aim
to recruit women to study the effects of in utero HIV exposure on infant
outcomes, and our findings can inform larger studies on these
relationships. The small sample size meant it was not possible to evaluate
associations between maternal ART and infant outcomes. Additionally,
although studies suggest an increased risk of prematurity in HIV affected
pregnancies (67), few pregnancies in our cohort were preterm, and as
such data from our population cannot be used to address possible
differences in risk of preterm birth between HEU and HUU groups. There
was also high attrition among both populations, particularly within the
HUU group, which may have led to sample bias at follow up. Individuals
from communities in this area are highly mobile, and although multiple
attempts were made to contact each mother to encourage her to return,
this presented challenges for study retention. Despite these limitations,
our study was able to capture information on infant growth, immune
function and neurodevelopment at two time points within the same infant
population. We are now conducting a larger prospective pregnancy and
birth cohort study at Kalafong Hospital to further investigate
relationships that have emerged in these exploratory pilot study analyses.
To our knowledge, this prospective cohort study is among the few to
concomitantly interrogate growth and neurodevelopmental outcomes and
immune function among a population of HIV-exposed, uninfected infants
in comparison to HIV-unexposed controls.
In agreement with previous and larger studies, our small feasibility pilot
study suggests that exposure to HIV in the womb adversely can affect
infant development. Whilst developmental and health outcomes in HEU

8

babies are likely less pronounced than adverse outcomes seen in HEI,
with the rising population of HEU infants due to progress made in
PMTCT, there is growing need to understand their development and
health outcomes to ensure that they have the healthiest start to life.
Importantly, this will open the door to interventions that, when applied in
early life, have the potential to correct developmental trajectories
established before birth due to exposure to HIV and ART.

Analysis approach and gating strategy: CCR2 expression on CD14+ monocytes

Supplementary figure S1. Sequential gating approach for the measurement of CCR2 expression by CD14+ monocytes. The sequential gating
approached used was as follows: First, the viable (7-AAD negative; region ‘Viable’’) cells were identified using a 7-AAD vs SS Log density plot. A “Viable”
region was created around the 7-AAD negative cells. Gated on the “Viable”cells, a SSLog vs FS plot was used to capture intact cells in the “E” region.
CD14+ monocytes were identified (“CD14+” region) using a CD14 vs SS Log density plot that were gated on viable, intact cells (“E” region). CD14+
monocytes that express CCR2 were quantified using a CD192 (CCR2) vs SS Log plot. The proportion of CD14+/CCR2+ cells were captured in the “CD14+
CCR2+” region. The gating strategy followed to quantify CCR2 expression by CD16+ neutrophils was similar to what was described for CD14+ monocytes,
but instead of identifying CD14+ monocytes, CD16+ neutrophils were identified (“CD16+” region) using a CD16 vs SS Log density plot that were gated on
viable, intact cells (“E” region). CD16+ neutrophils that express CCR2 were quantified using a CD192 (CCR2) vs SS Log plot. The proportion of
CD14+/CCR2+ cells was captured in the “CD16+ CCR2+” region.

Supplementary figure S2. Sequential gating approach for the measurement of CCR2 expression by monocyte sub-populations. Doublets and
debris were removed (Region ‘K’) using a FS Area vs FS Height density plot. A 7-AAD vs SS Log density plot, gated on ‘K’ was used to exclude all nonviable cells. Viable cells were captured in region ‘Viable’. Viable CD14+ monocytes were identified (Region ‘CD14+ Monocytes’) using a CD14 APC vs SS
Log density plot. Monocyte sub-populations were identified using a CD16 FITC vs CD14 PE density plot gated on viable, CD14+ monocytes. Four monocyte
sub-populations were identified: CD14+/CD16-; CD14++/CD16-; CD14+/CD16+; and CD14++/CD16+. The percentage CCR2+ monocytes present in each
of the respective monocyte sub-populations were identified using CD195 (CCR2) PE vs SS Log two-parameter plots gated on the respective subpopulations. The overlay plots within the black bordered square indicates the strategy used to determine CCR2 expression of the different monocyte
subsets.The negative/positive staining boundaries were determined based on the negative expression of CCR2 by CD16++/CD14- neutrophils (indicated
in red in the overlay plots). The CCR2+ populations are indicated in blue.

Boxes marked ‘x’ indicate that the variable was included in the final model, and covariates shaded grey were not considered as potential confounders for the respective outcome
variables. Known or suspected confounders for our outcome measures were included as covariables in regression models, including maternal (age, education, weight at delivery,
gravidity, parity, smoke exposure, breastfeeding practices) and infant (gestational age, sex, CCR2-positive CD14+ monocytes at birth and 12 weeks postpartum, age (days) at follow
up, growth rate from birth to 12 weeks postpartum), and through stepwise backward elimination, variables with a=0.20 were retained in the final models. HC = head circumference;
BBR = brain-to-body weight ratio; MFI = median fluorescence intensity; PP = postpartum; GMCD = Guide for monitoring child development.
