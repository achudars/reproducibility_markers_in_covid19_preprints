Abstract
Background
The last two decades have seen substantial expansion of childhood vaccination programmes in low
and middle income countries (LMICs). Here we quantify the health impact of these programmes by
estimating the deaths and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted by vaccination with ten
antigens in 98 LMICs between 2000 and 2030.

Methods
Independent research groups provided model-based disease burden estimates under a range of
vaccination coverage scenarios for ten pathogens: hepatitis B (HepB), Haemophilus influenzae type b
(Hib), human papillomavirus (HPV), Japanese encephalitis (JE), measles, Neisseria meningitidis
serogroup A (MenA), Streptococcus pneumoniae, rotavirus, rubella, yellow fever. Using standardized
demographic data and vaccine coverage estimates for routine and supplementary immunization
activities, the impact of vaccination programmes on deaths and DALYs was determined by
comparing model estimates from the no vaccination counterfactual scenario with those from a
default coverage scenario. We present results in two forms: deaths/DALYs averted in a particular
calendar year, and in a particular annual birth cohort.

Findings
We estimate that vaccination will have averted 69 (2.5-97.5% quantile range 52-88) million deaths
between 2000 and 2030 across the 98 countries and ten pathogens considered, 35 (29-45) million of
these between 2000-2018. From 2000-2018, this represents a 44% (36-57%) reduction in deaths due
to the ten pathogens relative to the no vaccination counterfactual. Most (96% (93-97%)) of this
impact is in under-five age mortality, notably from measles. Over the lifetime of birth cohorts born
between 2000 and 2030, we predict that 122 (96-147) million deaths will be averted by vaccination,
of which 58 (39-75) and 38 (26-52) million are due to measles and Hepatitis B vaccination,
respectively. We estimate that recent increases in vaccine coverage and introductions of additional
vaccines will result in a 72% (61-79%) reduction in lifetime mortality caused by these 10 pathogens
in the 2018 birth cohort.

Interpretation
Increases in vaccine coverage and the introduction of new vaccines into LMICs over the last two
decades have had a major impact in reducing mortality. These public health gains are predicted to
increase in coming decades if progress in increasing coverage is sustained.

Introduction
Vaccines have been responsible for substantial reductions in mortality 1–5 and vaccination is among
the most cost-effective health interventions

6,7

. In addition to direct protection afforded to

vaccinated individuals, high levels of vaccination coverage offer indirect protection (herd immunity)
to the remaining unvaccinated individuals in a population. Impact is seen on a timescale which is
vaccine-dependent: for some childhood diseases (such as measles, rotavirus, pneumococcal
disease), impact is seen rapidly, while for human papillomavirus (HPV) and hepatitis B, impacts are
commonly seen over a much longer timescale in the reduction of adult morbidity and mortality.
The World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI)
in 1974 8. The programme - supported by UNICEF and global donors - succeeded in delivering
substantial increases in coverage of routine childhood vaccines; for instance, global coverage of
DTP3 increased from just over 20% in 1980 to over 75% in 1990 9. However, as coverage plateaued in
the 1990s, concerns grew around the sustainability of these gains, eventually leading to the
formation of Gavi (the Vaccine Alliance) in 1999 10. Gavi’s mission is to sustain and increase coverage
and provide improved access to new vaccines in low and middle income countries (LMICs) 11. Since
its founding, it has supported immunisation of more than 700 million children in LMICs 12 . Global
targets for vaccination have also continued to grow in ambition: the Global Vaccine Action Plan
(GVAP) framework was launched in 2012 by WHO with the aim of preventing millions of deaths by
2020 through access to vaccines in all countries. This was further reinforced by target 3.8 of the
Sustainable Development Goals calling for access to “vaccines for all” by 2030 13.
Due to the limitations in completeness and quality of death registration and disease surveillance
systems in many LMICs, it is not possible in most of the world to directly measure the impact of
vaccination programmes on mortality and morbidity. Mathematical models are therefore an
essential tool for extrapolating from available disease burden and pathogen surveillance data to
generate impact estimates. Modelling is also required to generate projections of the impact of
future vaccine coverage to inform investment planning.
To improve the quality and coordination of vaccine impact assessment, the Vaccine Impact
Modelling Consortium (VIMC) was formed in late 2016 with the support of Gavi and the Bill &
Melinda Gates Foundation. VIMC currently comprises 18 modelling groups coordinated by a
secretariat at Imperial College London, and it models vaccination impact against diseases caused by
ten different pathogens across 98 countries (about 69% of the world’s population in 2018), including
the 73 countries currently eligible for Gavi support.
This paper presents the first complete set of vaccine impact estimates generated since VIMC was
formed, quantifying impact over annual birth cohorts between 2000-2030 in terms of deaths and
disability adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted. The ten pathogens included were hepatitis B (HepB),
Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), human papillomavirus (HPV), Japanese encephalitis (JE),
measles, Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A (MenA), Streptococcus pneumoniae (prevented by the

pneumococcal conjugate vaccine - PCV), rotavirus (rota), rubella virus and yellow fever virus (YF).
VIMC does not currently assess the impacts of diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis (DTP) vaccine 1,
cholera vaccine and polio vaccines. VIMC’s vaccine impact estimates are used to support the
monitoring of existing vaccination programmes and inform future investment strategy.

Methods
Modelling groups from different institutions with disease-specific expertise provided the pathogenspecific vaccine impact estimates (Table 1). A total of 20 pathogen-specific mathematical models
were used by VIMC to produce the vaccine impact estimates presented here: two models for each
pathogen other than HepB, which had three, and yellow fever, which had one. Including multiple
models for each pathogen enables some assessment of the impact of structural uncertainty in
models. Each model represents the impact of vaccine coverage and efficacy on national level disease
burden (and in some cases disease transmission dynamics) to estimate vaccine impact. Model
descriptions and the list of 98 LMICs included in the analysis are available in the supplementary
information (SI).
Standardised demographic data (live births per year, death rates) based on the United Nations
World Population Prospects (UNPD World Population Prospects - UNWPP 2017 14) was used for all
98 countries. Similarly, standardised national level estimates of vaccination coverage for each
vaccine considered were provided by the VIMC secretariat to each group. Past coverage in all
countries for 1980-2016 was obtained from WHO/UNICEF Estimates of National Immunization
Coverage (WUENIC) as published in July 2017 15, whose online coverage estimates are updated
annually. Future coverage estimates from 2017 to 2030 were based on Gavi’s strategic demand
forecast as of October 2017, for the countries eligible for Gavi support. Gavi’s operational forecasts
assume likely dates of vaccine introduction based on non-binding expressions of interest from
eligible countries, applications to Gavi for vaccine support, intended introductions as reported to the
World Health Organization (WHO), and assessment of country capacity to introduce a specific
vaccine in a specific time frame. Following introduction, coverage of new vaccines are typically
assumed to reach coverage of a reference vaccine (e.g., DTP3) within two to three years, after which
coverage is assumed to increase 1 percent per year up until a maximum of 90% or 95% depending
on the vaccine 1. For the 25 countries considered not supported by Gavi, and for years after 2030 for
countries in Gavi’s portfolio, an annual 1% increase in coverage was assumed from 2017 up to a
maximum of 90% or the historic high coverage achieved (if >90%). For newly introduced vaccines
with only an introduction date and no Gavi coverage forecast, we assumed that coverage would
increase to the same coverage as pentavalent (HepB-Hib-DTP3) vaccine in that country in the first
three years and subsequently increase by 1% per year. Estimates of numbers of vaccines received
per child by year were generated from these coverage estimates and projections assuming
independence of coverage between vaccines.
Disease burden was quantified by deaths and DALYs. DALYs measure the years of healthy life lost
due to premature death and disability from the disease, and are the sum of years of life lost (YLLs)
through premature mortality and years lived with disability (YLDs). Estimates of deaths and DALYs
were stratified by age. No discounting or weighting was applied in the calculation of DALYs.

Age-stratified pathogen-specific disease burden estimates (deaths and DALYs) for annual birth
cohorts between 2000 to 2030 were generated by each modelling group. Corresponding estimates
for the counterfactual scenario, assuming no vaccination had occurred after 2000, were also
produced. Supplementary immunisation activities (SIAs), other immunisation campaigns and second
doses were modelled when relevant.
For rubella, only disease burden from congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) 16 was assessed, since
rubella only causes mild disease in infected persons. Since the occurrence of CRS in infants is
determined by the vaccination and infection status of the mother while pregnant, disease burden for
CRS was reported by the age of the mother (at the time of birth) and not to that of the infant.
The impact of vaccination was assessed by comparing the counterfactual (‘no vaccination’) scenario
with the vaccination scenarios. Two forms of aggregation were used to present the results: by
calendar year and by year of birth. The former assesses the difference in burden between the
vaccination and no-vaccination scenarios for a specific year, and gives a cross-sectional view of
impact. The latter sums disease burden across every year of life for each yearly birth cohort (born
between 2000 and 2030) before again calculating the difference between vaccination and novaccination scenarios, and therefore gives a lifetime view of vaccine impact.
The population-attributable benefit of vaccination for each pathogen was estimated by calculating
the proportion of annual deaths due to each pathogen that would be prevented by vaccination.
We use model averaging to derive impact estimates, with each model for a pathogen given equal
weighting. Uncertainty in model estimates was assessed by generating 200 sets of estimates from
each model, probabilistically sampling over model parameter uncertainty. The same randomly
sampled sets of parameters were used for both vaccination and no-vaccination model runs, allowing
uncertainty in vaccine impact to be assessed. Central pathogen-specific estimates presented here
represent averages over all such samples from every model available for each pathogen. The 95%
(2.5 and 97.5% quantiles) credible intervals presented for each pathogen are derived by combining
the probabilistic distributions of estimated impact from all the models available for that pathogen.
Estimates involving aggregation across pathogens were generated via a bootstrap approach under
the simplifying assumption that the drivers of uncertainty in each model are independent of those in
any other model. For each model, a random sample of the statistic of interest was drawn from the
200 probabilistic runs. These model-specific samples were combined by averaging them across
models of the same pathogen and then summing the resulting pathogen-specific estimates across
pathogens. Means and 2.5 and 97.5% quantiles of 100,000 such bootstrap samples were calculated
to derive central estimates and 95% credible intervals.
The main text of this paper focuses on presenting vaccine impacts on mortality; more detailed
estimates of mortality impacts and estimates of DALYs averted by vaccination are given in the SI.

Results
The average number of vaccines received per child increased consistently and substantially across
the great majority of the 98 countries (Table S1) between 2000 and 2018 (Figure 1A-C). Both
increases in coverage of existing vaccines (e.g. measles-containing vaccines) and the introduction of
new vaccines (e.g. rotavirus) contribute to this overall trend (Figure 1D). Routine vaccination against
JE and rotavirus began to be introduced from 2006, PCV in 2010, HPV in 2014 and MenA in 2016. In
addition, coverage increases likely reflect the increase in countries eligible for Gavi support (Table
S2).
To assess the impact of vaccine use on mortality, we quantify the expected burden of disease in the
counterfactual scenario of no vaccination (Figure 2, red curves) and estimate the impact of observed
and projected vaccination coverage on that baseline mortality (Figure 2, blue curves). Depending on
the pathogen considered, long-term trends in disease prevalence interact with global population
growth and aging to result in a variety of projected trends in disease-specific mortality in the
counterfactual no-vaccination scenario. However, for all but two pathogens, vaccination between
2000 and 2030 is estimated to cause substantial reductions in the mortality burden in the same time
period. The two exceptions are HepB and HPV where most mortality in that time window is due to
infections that have already occurred, due to the typically long time delay between infection and
severe outcomes for those infections. While HepB vaccination coverage is now relatively high and
projected to increase further, most of the impacts of this will only be seen after 2030. For HPV, most
countries have yet to introduce vaccination.
The age distribution of mortality varies dramatically across the 10 pathogens as a result of
differences in their epidemiology: HepB- and HPV-attributable mortality primarily affects those over
40 years of age, YF, MenA and JE are epidemic diseases which largely affect those under 30 (due to
natural immunity acquired with age in older adults), while mortality for all other pathogens is nearly
entirely focused in the under-5s (though note that mortality due to infection with rubella is
attributed to the age of the mother and is therefore focused in women of childbearing age).
Figure 3 presents the estimated numbers of deaths averted by vaccination in the 98 countries (see
also SI Tables 5(a-h)). Two views are given: total deaths averted by calendar year (Figure 3A), and
deaths averted over the lifetime of each annual birth cohort (Figure 3B).
Looking by calendar year, we estimate a total of 69 (52-88) million deaths averted between 2000
and 2030, 35 (29-45) million of which were averted between 2000 and 2018. In the 73 Gavi
countries, the corresponding values are 66 (49-82) million deaths averted between 2000-2030, 33
(27-42) million of which were averted between 2000-2018.

Measles vaccination has the largest impact, with 56 (39-74) million deaths averted (54 (38-70)
million in the 73 Gavi countries).

Considering deaths averted by birth cohort (Figure 3B and Table 2), the longer-term impact of
increasing coverage of HepB vaccination becomes clearer. However, since the great majority of
HepB deaths (due to liver disease) occur in those over 45 years of age, the impact of vaccination in
the 2000-2030 time period will only really start to be seen from 2040 onwards. Similar arguments
apply to HPV vaccination (though coverage is substantially lower than for HepB): cervical cancer
deaths largely occur in women over 50, leading to a delay of nearly 40 years between vaccination
and its direct impact on mortality. Thus, summing vaccination impact over the full lifetimes of the
2000-2030 birth cohorts gives a total of 122 (96-147) million deaths averted in total, 65 (47-69)
million of which are in the under-5s. In the 73 Gavi countries, the corresponding values are 106 (81130) million deaths averted in the 2000-2030 birth cohorts, 65 (49-83) million of which are in the
under-5s. Table 2 summarises deaths averted by pathogen and illustrates that in the 2000-2030 birth
cohorts over 53% (44-63%) of deaths averted are in children under 5 years.
The extent to which vaccination reduces overall mortality due to the 10 pathogens varies
substantially by country (Figure 3C), largely due to historical variations in vaccination coverage, but
also due to variation in the epidemiology of some pathogens by country. Summing across the 98
countries we consider, we estimate vaccination will prevent 72% (61-79%) of the mortality
associated with these 10 pathogens in the 2018 annual birth cohort. Considering only under-5
mortality, this proportion rises to 76% (59-83%). In the 73 Gavi countries, the corresponding values
are a 71% (60-78%) reduction in all-age mortality, and a 77% (60-83%) reduction in under-5
mortality.
In the period 2000-2018, we estimate that vaccination in the 98 countries reduced overall mortality
and under-5 mortality due to these pathogens by 44% (36-57%) and 57% (52-64%), respectively. In
the 73 Gavi countries, these reductions were 47% (39-58%) and 57% (52-64%), respectively. For the
period 2019-2030, we project these reductions will respectively rise to 60% (33-74%) and 77% (4285%) in all 98 countries and 64% (35-76%) and 77% (42-85%) in the 73 Gavi countries.
It is informative to place these estimates in their demographic context. Taking the 2018 birth cohort
as an example, and using UNWPP demographic estimates (see Methods), we estimate that under-5
mortality in the 98 countries would be 45% (33-56%) higher in the absence of any vaccination
against the ten pathogens. The total number of deaths (occurring at any age) averted in the 2018
birth cohort represent 4.2% (3.3-5.1%) of the live births making up that cohort.
Total impact reflects vaccination coverage as well as underlying disease burden and vaccine
effectiveness. We therefore also examine the relative impact of each vaccine, by quantifying deaths
averted per vaccinated individual for each pathogen (Table 2 and SI Tables 6(a-h)). This highlights
that while measles and PCV have the largest relative impact on under-5 mortality, vaccines against
HPV, HepB and YF have the largest impact per person vaccinated. YF and HPV vaccination have the
largest relative impact of all the vaccines considered, with central estimates for both of over 16 (532) deaths averted per 1000 persons vaccinated for the 2000-2018 birth cohorts.
Since most of the pathogens considered (namely Hib, JE, measles, PCV, rota, rubella) largely result in

under-5 mortality, the impact of vaccination on DALYs largely mirrors the impact on mortality (Fig
S3). Since HepB and HPV related deaths are focused in the over 50s, mortality contributes fewer
years of life lost (YLLs) for these pathogens, but morbidity contributes higher years lived with
disability for both infections (HepB particularly). Estimates of vaccine impact in DALYs averted are
presented in the SI.

Discussion
This study represents the largest scale study of health impacts of immunisation in LMICs yet
undertaken, covering vaccination programs against 10 pathogens and evaluating impact in 98
countries. It represents an advance on past work 1 in its scale (in both antigens and countries
considered) and in the emphasis of VIMC on standardising model inputs (vaccine coverage and
demography) and outputs (age-specific mortality and DALYs by year of birth cohort and age). Such
standardisation allows impacts to be combined across and compared between vaccines.
We find that immunisation programmes in the 98 countries considered will result in individuals born
in 2018 experiencing 72% (61-79%) lower mortality due to those 10 pathogens over their lifetime
than they would otherwise. Furthermore, in the absence of vaccination, we estimate that all-cause
under-5 mortality would be 45% (33-56%) higher than currently observed. These impacts are a
testament to both the public health benefit of vaccines overall and the sustained investment in
increasing global vaccination coverage in the last two decades. They also highlight what might be
lost if current vaccination programmes are not sustained, and thus provide quantitative evidence
supporting both donor and country investments in vaccination programmes.
Deriving these impact estimates is far from straightforward: cause-specific mortality data in the
LMICs considered is very limited, making direct observational assessment of impact challenging.
However, to inform monitoring and decision-making, countries and international organizations such
as Gavi require projections of potential impact under a range of investment scenarios. To fill these
gaps, mathematical and statistical models can be used to extrapolate data on levels of current
infection (such as case detection from active surveillance) and/or past infection (such as
serosurveys) to sites and countries without such data. They can also be used to project future trends
given information about vaccine coverage.
In addition, our study has focused on quantifying uncertainty in vaccine impact. Given the limited
explicit data on pathogen-specific disease burden available in many of the 98 countries considered,
nearly all models need to extrapolate from settings where data are available to those where data are
absent. This, together with imperfect knowledge of aspects of the epidemiology of each pathogen
(e.g. case fatality ratios, transmissibility, disease progression rates) means that uncertainty in
vaccine impact estimates from a single model can be substantial. Here this uncertainty is quantified
probabilistically, with each modelling group providing 200 models runs spanning the range of
parametric uncertainty in their models.
A second source of uncertainty is structural: different modelling groups make different subjective
choices about how to represent disease epidemiology and may use different data for model

parameterisation. In addition, the models within VIMC vary substantially: in their type (static cohort
models versus transmission-dynamic models), in their complexity (e.g. in the representation of age
effects), and in their approaches to calibration and validation (from formal statistical likelihood
approaches to more ad-hoc calibration). VIMC therefore includes at least two models for each
pathogen (with the exception of YF) and combines results from different models to derive central
estimates of impact and to better quantify underlying uncertainty (see Methods).
A limitation of our current analysis is that we do not currently evaluate uncertainty in demographic
estimates and estimates of past and future vaccine coverage. Developing principled approaches to
doing so is a topic of current research, but is made challenging by the limited information available
on uncertainty in UNWPP demographic estimates and in WHO UENIC and Gavi operational forecast
vaccine coverage estimates.
The majority of models within VIMC adopt a ‘bottom-up’ approach to modelling disease burden and
thus the impact of vaccination. These models represent time- and age-varying pathogen-specific
infection or disease rates in each country, then model mortality as affecting a fraction of those
infected by applying a case fatality ratio (generally estimated from a combination of longitudinal
epidemiological studies and surveillance data) to resulting case incidence estimates. As the disease
burden attributed to each pathogen is modelled separately, there is a theoretical risk of
overestimating deaths due to a failure to account for competing causes of mortality, particularly in
the under-5s, where most mortality is concentrated. However, in the 2018 annual birth cohort,
UNWPP projections estimate all-cause under-5 mortality at 5% for the 98 countries considered. We
estimate the 10 pathogens we consider will cause approximately one seventh of this (0.69% (0.51.2%)). With such low absolute proportions, the effect of competing hazards of death on overall
mortality estimates is negligible. Conversely, when assessing deaths averted, we consider the
counterfactual of no vaccination for each vaccine antigen separately, subsequently summing across
all vaccines, since one child’s life can be saved multiple times.
For most pathogens, we currently model infection risk as homogeneous within individual countries
(the exceptions being the YF and JE models). Furthermore, no models in this study account for
geographic or socioeconomic clustering of vaccine coverage, or for any potential correlation
between access to healthcare (including vaccines) and disease risk. Thus, we may be ignoring
disadvantaged sub-populations in countries with lower than average access to vaccines and/or
higher than average intrinsic exposure to infection. Subnational stratification of vaccine impact
estimates are a priority for future work but require similarly fine-grained estimates of vaccine
coverage 17 and disease burden.
Last, in making long-term projections of disease burden and intervention impact, it is necessary to
make assumptions about the likely improvements in treatment and disease outcomes in future
decades. This is a particular issue for HepB and HPV, where cancer screening and treatment services
can make a substantial difference to disease-related mortality 18, or for measles where decreasing
background under-five mortality can significantly reduce case-fatality ratios 19. The HPV and HepB
models included in VIMC currently make conservative (i.e. relatively pessimistic) assumptions about

of the epidemiology and disease burden caused by all 10 pathogens continues to improve, and
models of those diseases should likewise continue to be refined. In addition, future vaccine coverage
is unlikely to precisely match the coverage projections used here. Thus, the outputs - whether
estimates of the impact of past immunisation activities or projections of future impact - will also
change. However, the results in this paper provide the most comprehensive and definitive
assessment to date of the impact of the dramatic advances in immunisation coverage in LMICs in the
last two decades.
Finally, our analysis highlights where the greatest gains from future investments in improving
vaccine coverage are to be made. We predict increasing HPV coverage in girls will avert more deaths
per person vaccinated than any other immunisation activity, while increasing PCV coverage will give
the largest reductions in under-5 mortality. However, it is even more important not to allow the
coverage gains achieved since 2000 to slip back. This requires continued political commitment,
funding, civil society engagement (in promoting benefits and countering hesitancy), improving public
trust and confidence in the safety and efficacy of vaccines 20, and strengthening immunisation
programmes through education, training and supervision 21.

received per child in (A) 2000, (B) 2010, (C) 2018. The colour scale shows the expected number of vaccines
received per child in each country. (D) Routine vaccine coverage for each pathogen, from 2000 to 2018,
averaged across all 98 countries except for JE, MenA and YF which were averaged across the 16, 26 and 32
endemic countries for those pathogens, respectively. The average was obtained by dividing total vaccine doses
by the total eligible population.
