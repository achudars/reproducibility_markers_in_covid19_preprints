Rate of Force Development and Function in CKD
1

ABSTRACT

2

Background Physical function is severely compromised in people with chronic kidney disease

3

(CKD) and worsens with continued decreases in kidney function. Neuromuscular force capacity

4

is a key determinant of physical function in healthy older adults, though its importance in

5

persons with CKD is less understood. Methods This study aimed to determine the relationships

6

among rate of force development (RFD), muscle quality and physical function in a group of

7

community-dwelling, middle-aged and older men (n=14; age=71.2±6.2 years) with CKD stages

8

3 and 4 (eGFR=37.5±10.4 ml/min per 1.73 m2). Force characteristics were determined from

9

maximal knee extensor isometric contractions and muscle quality was estimated using

10

ultrasound grayscale analysis. Physical function was assessed by the Short Physical

11

Performance Battery (SPPB) and 5-repetition sit-to-stand (STS) test. Results eGFR was directly

12

related to SPPB (r=0.54, p=0.044) and inversely related to STS (r=-0.62, p=0.029). RFD was

13

positively related to SPPB at time points 0-50 ms, 50-100 ms, and 0-300 ms (RFD0-50, r=0.73,

14

p=0.010; RFD50-100, r=0.67, p=0.022 and RFD0-300 r=0.61, p=0.045); and inversely related to STS

15

at time points 0-50 ms, 50-100 ms, and 0-300 ms (RFD0-50, r=-0.78, p=0.007; RFD50-100, r=-0.78,

16

p=0.006 and RFD0-300 r=-0.76, p=0.009), respectively. RFD was positively associated with

17

maximal voluntary force (MVF) at times 50-100 ms, 100-200 ms, and 0-300 ms (RFD50-100,

18

r=0.72, p=0.011; RFD100-200, r=0.66, p=0.025; and RFD0-300 r=0.70, p=0.016), respectively.

19

Neither MVF nor muscle quality was significantly associated with functional measures.

20

Conclusions RFD is an important determinant of physical function in middle-aged and older men

21

with CKD stages 3 and 4.

Rate of Force Development and Function in CKD
24

INTRODUCTION

25

Physical function is severely compromised in people with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and has

26

been shown to be predictive of risk of hospitalization, disability and mortality (10, 16, 17, 25, 26,

27

28, 30, 33). For example, individuals with low functional status at the time of dialysis initiation

28

experience a higher risk of all-cause mortality irrespective of age and history of cardiovascular

29

disease (10). Similarly, functional measures of gait speed and timed-up-and-go are better

30

predictors of 3-year mortality than are kidney function or commonly measured serum

31

biomarkers in patients with CKD predialysis (29).

32
33

Rate of force development (RFD) describes the rate at which force is expressed during fast and

34

forceful contractions and has become recognized as an underlying factor contributing to

35

physical function in older adults (8, 24). Early time intervals (i.e., <75 ms) of RFD are thought to

36

be primarily influenced by neural factors, whereas muscular factors become increasingly

37

important with greater time from onset of contraction (3, 20, 27). However, Gerstner et al.

38

reported that age-associated declines in rapid torque production during later time intervals (i.e.,

39

≥100 ms) are influenced by alterations in muscle quality, architecture, and muscle activation (4).

40
41

Accelerated skeletal muscle loss is a major concern in patients with CKD and end-stage renal

42

disease (ESRD) (34). Reductions in muscle cross-sectional area have been associated with

43

declines in physical function (13, 21). Neurological complications, including peripheral

44

neuropathy, are also highly prevalent in patients with CKD (1, 15). Accordingly, both neural and

45

muscle morphological alterations are potential factors contributing to muscle weakness. The

46

loss in neuromuscular force is reported to occur more rapidly than changes in muscle cross-

47

sectional area in patients with CKD predialysis and ESRD (14, 18). Moreover, changes in

48

muscle cross-sectional area have been found to be poorly associated with changes in functional

49

outcomes (14). Taken together, these observations further highlight the potential contributions

of neural alterations, in addition to muscle morphological properties, on neuromuscular capacity

51

in patients with CKD.

52
53

Currently, there is little information describing neuromuscular contributions to physical function

54

in patients with CKD predialysis. Consequently, the effects of compromised force characteristics

55

and muscle quality, if present, on physical function in those with CKD predialysis are unclear. In

56

this study, we aimed to determine the relationships among RFD, muscle quality and physical

57

function in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4 predialysis. We hypothesized that RFD, maximal

58

voluntary force (MVF), and muscle quality would be significantly associated with physical

59

function in patients with CKD stages 3 and 4.

60
61

METHODS

62

Study Design. A single cohort, cross-sectional study design was used to examine the

63

relationships among knee extensor RFD, maximum voluntary force (MVF), muscle quality of the

64

rectus femoris (RF), and sit-to-stand (STS) time in a convenience sample of middle-aged and

65

older men with CKD stages 3 and 4 seen at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center. Data were

66

collected by trained staff in the Renal Clinic, and Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation and

67

Research Service groups at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Washington, DC (DC

68

VAMC) and the study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03160326).

69
70

Participants and Ethical Approval. Community-dwelling male Veterans were screened and

71

referred by the Renal Clinic staff at the DC VAMC for potential enrollment. The study was

72

approved by the DC VAMC Institutional Review Board and Research and Development

73

Committee. Inclusion criteria for study enrollment required participants to be ambulatory, with or

74

without use of an assistive device, aged 18-85 years, and diagnosed with CKD stage 3 or 4,

75

based on eGFR measures obtained within the 3-months prior to study enrollment. Exclusion

criteria included a history of acute kidney injury, any uncontrolled cardiovascular or

77

musculoskeletal problems, or having a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator. All

78

participants voluntarily provided written informed consent using an IRB approved form prior to

79

study participation.

80
81

Procedures. Each participant reported to the Skeletal Muscle Laboratory in the Clinical

82

Research Center at the DC VAMC to complete neuromuscular strength, muscle quality and

83

physical function assessments. Participants were asked to refrain from any vigorous activity for

84

at least 24 hours before testing. Quantitative ultrasound imaging preceded strength and

85

functional testing. At least 30-minutes was allotted between strength and functional

86

assessments to minimize the potential for test contamination due to fatigue.

87
88

Diagnostic Ultrasound Assessments. Methods used for diagnostic ultrasound assessments

89

have previously been published (9, 11). Sonographic images were obtained using B-mode

90

diagnostic ultrasound with a 5-18 MHz linear array transducer (Nobulus, Hitachi Aloka Medical,

91

Parsippany, NJ). Manufacturer default settings for time gain compensation and near field/far

92

field gain were applied for all musculoskeletal scans. The field of view was adjusted for each

93

participant to optimally capture the region of interest (ROI) of the RF on the dominant side.

94

Standardized procedures were followed for the identification of the scanning site, as previously

95

described (9, 11). Scanned images were obtained by a single clinical investigator (MHL) with

96

more than 10 years of quantitative ultrasound experience.

97
98

Quantitative Strength Testing. Knee extensor strength of the dominant leg was assessed using

99

a portable fixed dynamometer (FGV-200XY, NIDEC instruments, Itasca, IL). The dynamometer

100

was securely mounted and anchored behind the participant. Participants were placed in the

101

seated position on the edge of an adjustable examination table and with their hips and knees at

90˚ of flexion. A strap attached to the dynamometer was secured around the ankle of the

103

dominant leg. Participants were allowed to use their hands for stability but were asked to refrain

104

from grasping onto the table. A familiarization session was provided before data collection to

105

orient each participant to the isometric testing procedures. Participants were instructed to

106

extend or kick their leg as “hard” as possible following the test administrator’s requests, and to

107

contract and sustain the contraction for 5-seconds while being provided strong verbal

108

encouragement. A rest period of approximately 1-minute was provided between repetitions. Pre-

109

contraction tension and countermovement were removed by test administrators and the

110

dynamometer was zeroed just before contraction initiation.

111
112

Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). The SPPB is a measure used to assess lower

113

extremity function and is predictive of subsequent disability in persons over 70 years of age (6).

114

The SPPB is composed of tasks assessing balance, walking speed, and the ability to rise from a

115

chair. A composite score is generated with the highest possible score being 12. Those

116

completing the respective tasks were assigned a score of 1 to 4 on each task, with higher

117

scores representative of better performance of the task. Participants unable to complete a task

118

were given a score of zero for that task. Complete details of the SPPB have been described

119

elsewhere (7).

120
121

Sit-to-Stand (STS). For the purposes of this study we also examined the STS task independent

122

of the SPPB as the ability to rise from a chair repeatedly has been used as a measure to assess

123

lower extremity power (32). STS determined as the time taken to complete 5 sit-to-stand

124

repetitions. The test was stopped if the participant became tired or short of breath, used his

125

arms, was unable to complete the five repetitions within one-minute, or if the test administrator

126

became concerned about the participant’s safety.

Data analysis.

129

Quantitative Ultrasound. All scanned images were obtained and measured 3 times within the

130

fascial borders of the muscle. The ROI selection and echogenicity measures of the RF via

131

grayscale (GSL) histogram analysis were completed using ImageJ (version 1.48; National

132

Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA). ROI was defined as the area within the superior and

133

inferior fascial borders and the lateral borders of the RF. In those instances when a portion of a

134

fascial border was poorly visualized, the examiner used the trajectory of the visible fascial

135

border to complete the ROI selection (11). Subcutaneous fat was quantified according to

136

methods described by Stock et al. (31). The mean of the three thickness values from each

137

image was utilized. GSL values were then corrected for subcutaneous fat using the following

138

equation (31): corrected GSL = uncorrected GSL + (subcutaneous fat thickness [cm] x

139

40.5278).

140
141

Strength Testing. The real-time force applied to the dynamometer was displayed online on a

142

computer monitor. Force data were sampled at 100Hz and digitally stored to be analyzed offline.

143

No more than six maximal voluntary isometric contractions were completed during strength

144

assessments. Peak isometric knee extensor strength was determined by averaging 3 attempts

145

which fell within 10% of each other or the 3 highest values of the six attempts. Rate of force

146

development (RFD) was calculated as the change in force by change in time following the

147

initiation of isometric knee extension contraction and assessed over consecutive time epochs;

148

0-50 ms, 50-100 ms, 100-200 ms, and 200-300 ms (i.e., RFD0-50, RFD50-100, RFD100-200, and

149

RFD200-300). RFD was also calculated as the change in force by the change in time over the first

150

300 ms of the contraction (i.e., RFD0-300) (Figure 1). The onset of contraction was determined as

151

the first derivative of the filtered force signaling that crossed 2.5% of peak force (20). In addition

152

to absolute RFD, RFD is expressed relative to MVF (RFD/MVF), corrected RF GSL (RFD/GSL),

153

and RF muscle thickness (MT) (RFD/MT) (19, 20, 27). Specific force was calculated as MVF

Statistical analyses.

160

Data are presented as mean values ± SD unless otherwise noted. Normality of each variable

161

was assessed with the Shapiro-Wilk test. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients (r)

162

were used to determine associations among estimates of knee extensor strength, muscle

163

quality, and physical function. The magnitudes of the correlation coefficients were described as

164

0.00-0.30, 0.30-0.50, 0.50-0.70, 0.70-0.90, and 0.90-1.00 and interpreted as negligible, low,

165

moderate, high, and very high, respectively (23). Statistical significance was set at p<0.05 for

166

two-tailed tests. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 26 (SPSS Inc.,

167

Chicago, IL).

RESULTS

170

Participant characteristics are presented in Table 1. Study participants were classified as

171

exhibiting moderately to severely decreased kidney function based on mean eGFR, with 14% of

172

participants classified with CKD stage 3a (n=2), 57% with CKD stage 3b (n=8), and 29% with

173

CKD stage 4 (n=4). According to BMI, 36% of participants were classified as overweight (n=5)

174

while 64% were classified as obese (n=9). Two of the fourteen participants, both classified as

175

CKD stage 4, were unable to complete a single STS repetition and therefore were not included

176

in the STS analysis. eGFR was directly related to the SPPB (r=0.54, p=0.044) and inversely

177

related to STS (r=-0.62, p=0.029). No other significant relationships were observed between

178

eGFR and RFD outcomes, MVF, RF GSL, or RF MT (data not shown). RFD data were

179

unavailable on three participants; and therefore, eleven participants were included in the

DISCUSSION

241
242

Reduced kidney function, as assessed by eGFR, was associated with declines in physical

243

functional assessments. Moderate to strong relationships were found between RFD and SPPB,

244

STS, and MVF. When controlling for MVF, RFD was moderately to strongly associated with STS

245

and moderately related to muscle quality. While RFD was associated with MVF, no significant

246

relationships were observed between measures of MVF and functional outcomes. The findings

247

of the present study suggest that functional performance is significantly related to RFD in middle

248

aged and older men with CKD stages 3 and 4 predialysis.

249
250

The decline in physical function is accelerated in patients with CKD predialysis and ESRD and

251

progressively worsens as kidney function declines (16, 21). Variations of the STS task have

252

been found to be related to aerobic capacity and muscle cross-sectional area in patients with

253

CKD predialysis and ESRD (21, 25). The current results are in agreement with previous findings

254

on STS and CKD in demonstrating an inverse moderately significant relationship between

255

eGFR and STS. The present data extend previous findings, showing inverse, moderately-to-

256

highly signficant associations between RFD at time points 0-50 ms, 50-100 ms, and 0-300 ms,

257

and the STS. Moreover, the relationship between RFD and STS was maintained when

258

controlling for maximal force (i.e., MVF) and muscle quality (i.e., RF GSL).

259
260

Limited data are currently available regarding the impact of CKD and ESRD on RFD. Molsted et

261

al. reported that, in dialysis patients, 16-weeks of resistance exercise training increased

262

electromyographic (EMG) amplitude during the 200-300 ms time period following the onset of

263

muscle contraction, with a concomitant increase of 21-38% in RFD of the knee extensors (22).

264

These findings support resistance exercise as a possible treatment option for enhancing RFD in

265

patients with ESRD. Gollie et al. recently highlighted the relative lack of information on the

266

effects of resistance exercise for improving neuromuscular power, as compared to strength and

267

muscle hypertrophy, in patients with CKD predialysis (5). Therefore, additional research is

268

necessary to determine which resistance exercise approaches are most effective for improving

269

RFD and physical function in such patients, and the feasibility and tolerability of such

270

approaches.

271
272

Although peak knee extensor force (i.e., MVF) was not significantly related to functional ability in

273

the current study, it was positively associated with absolute RFD at time points 50-100 ms, 100-

274

200 ms, and 0-300 ms, suggesting that peak isometric knee extensor force has important

275

implications for RFD in adults with CKD predialysis. It has been suggested that voluntary RFD

276

becomes increasingly more dependent on maximal force generating capacity and less

277

dependent on muscle twitch characteristics with increasing time after the onset of contraction (2,

278

3, 20, 27). At time intervals later than 90 ms from the onset of contraction, maximal strength

279

accounted for 52-81% of the variance in RFD. In contrast, in very early time intervals (< 40 ms),

280

RFD was only moderately associated with twitch contractile properties, and was less related to

281

maximal force capacity (2).

Rate of Force Development and Function in CKD
283

Research on neuromuscular properties in patients with kidney disease has primarily focused on

284

muscle size in the ESRD population on dialysis, due to their increased risk for accelerated

285

muscle loss (34). Johansen et al. demonstrated that decreased gait speed was associated with

286

loss in muscle contractile area and maximal isometric knee extensor strength in ambulatory

287

hemodialysis participants (13). Conversely, John et al. reported that change in muscle cross-

288

sectional area over 2-years was poorly correlated with change in STS (14). In non-dialysis

289

patients, Wilkinson et al. found that muscle quality was inversely related to functional outcomes

290

but that RF cross-sectional area was a better predictor of functional performance when

291

compared to muscle quality (35). Our results posit RFD as an additional variable to aid in

292

understanding the effects of of CKD predialysis on physical function and neuromuscular

293

capacity. The lack of consistency across studies highlights the complexity of neuromuscular

294

complications associated with CKD and the need for further research designed to clarify the

295

relationships between neuromuscular properties and physical function in this patient population.

296
297

Limitations. The small sample size and lack of women participants precludes generalization of

298

the current findings beyond our study sample. The absence of control study participants, i.e.

299

individuals without moderate to severe declines in kidney function, limits the ability to determine

300

if, or the extent to which, RFD was compromised because of CKD in our patient population. The

301

instructions to participants in the present study to contract as “hard” as possible may have

302

resulted in an underestimation of RFD capabilities. Lastly, the presence of multiple

303

comorbidities is common in patients with CKD predialysis; consequently, it is unclear how the

304

type and number of comorbidities in our study population may have influenced the findings of

305

the current study.

308

In community-dwelling, middle-aged and older men with CKD stages 3 and 4, RFD is

309

significantly associated with MVF, muscle quality and physical function. Further studies are

310

warranted to determine the responsiveness of RFD to exercise interventions targeting physical

311

function in patients with CKD predialysis and ESRD.
