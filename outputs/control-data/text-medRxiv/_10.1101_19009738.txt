Abstract
Objective
To examine the independent and joint associations thigh-worn accelerometry assessed sedentary time and
moderate to vigorous physical activity with cardiometabolic health markers.
Design
Cross-sectional study embedded in the age-46 wave an established birth cohort, the 1970 British Birth
Cohort.
Setting
Population-based sample from Great Britain (England, Scotland, and Wales).
Methods
Outcome measures included: body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, blood pressure, glycated hemoglobin,
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, total cholesterol, triglycerides, and c-reactive protein. Sedentary
behavior and other physical activity exposures, recorded by a thigh-worn activPAL3 accelerometry,
included: daily sedentary time, breaks in sedentary time, daily time spent in moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity. Multiple linear regression analyses, multiple logistic regression analyses, and general linear models
were conducted as applicable.
Results
4,634 participants were available for the final analysis. After adjusting for potential confounders and
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, daily sedentary time was positively associated with triglycerides
(β=0.052 [0.015, 0.089]) and inversely associated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (β=-0.015 [0.022, -0.010]). Daily prolonged sedentary time (≥ 60 minutes) was positively associated with both glycated
hemoglobin and log-transformed c-reactive protein (β=0.240 [0.030, 0.440] and 0.026 [0.007, 0.045],
respectively) and inversely associated with systolic blood pressure and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(β=-0.450 [-0.760, -0.150] and -0.013 [-0.022, -0.003], respectively). After adjusting for potential

confounders and daily sedentary time, daily breaks in sedentary time were inversely associated with
glycated hemoglobin (β=-0.020 [-0.037, -0.003]), and positively associated with both triglycerides and
systolic blood pressure (β=0.006 [0.002, 0.010] and 0.030 [0.002, 0.050], respectively). The joint
associations of prolonged sedentary time and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity with the prevalence
of diabetes were not statistically significant.
Conclusion
Prolonged sedentary time (≥ 60 minutes) and daily breaks in sedentary time were deleteriously associated
with glycated hemoglobin, although we found no evidence that there were joint moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity and sitting associations.

Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is an escalating major global health issue, and physical inactivity is
a core etiological factor (1). Sedentary behavior, defined as low energy expenditure (≤1.5 metabolic
equivalents) in a sitting or reclining posture during waking times, has been associated with adverse
cardiometabolic health and elevated mortality risk (2–4). Current public health guidelines suggest both
increasing physical activity levels and decreasing sedentary time to ameliorate the possible CVD-related
health burden (1,5). However, the sedentary behavior guidelines still lack consistent, and more robust
scientific evidence is needed to support their efficacy.
Results from a recent meta-analysis (2), based on the nine cohort studies measuring sedentary
behavior with self-reported questionnaires, found that, independent of physical activity levels, prolonged
sedentary time (over 10 hours/day) was associated with CVD-related mortality and incidence rate. On the
contrary, another meta-analysis (6), including 13 questionnaire-based cohort studies, suggested that 1 hour
of daily physical activity of moderate to vigorous intensity would eliminate the associations between
sedentary time and mortality risk. The inconclusive interaction between sedentary time and physical activity
for CVD risk might be, in part, due to measurement error (5). Questionnaires are limited in their capacity
to accurately characterize physical activity and sedentary profiles as they inquire about selected aspects of
movement and have poor validity (7,8). As a result, studies using objective (device-based) measurements
are needed to better understand the joint association of the two exposures with cardiometabolic health.
Aside from total sedentary time, other patterns of sedentary behavior, e.g., sedentary
interruptions/breaks and duration of each bout, can be better explored by studies using accelerometry (4).
One recent prospective cohort study (9) suggested a direct association between hip-worn accelerometer
assessed sedentary time bout duration and all-cause mortality risk. However, wrist/waist-worn
accelerometry could not distinguish the components of stationary behavior, e.g., working at a standing
station or sitting in an office. The measured interruption could be either stand/ambulation changes or sit-

stand transitions. Thigh-worn accelerometry has better-established validity and reliability for measuring
posture, activity intensity, and ambulatory movement in free-living conditions in adults (10–12). To date,
the most extensive cross-sectional study using thigh-worn accelerometers (13) suggested that the odds ratios
of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes were higher in individuals with higher sedentary time or lower
moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Another relatively small-scale cross-sectional study (14) found that
the number of breaks in sedentary time was beneficially associated with cardiometabolic health markers,
e.g., body mass index, waist circumference, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides
(TG). It also suggested that long average sedentary bout duration would exacerbate the cardiometabolic
risks, e.g., lowering HDL-C and elevating TG (14).
However, to date, no large-scale epidemiological study has utilized thigh-worn accelerometry to
investigate the cardiometabolic health potential of physical activity and breaks in sedentary time. The aim
of this study, therefore, was to examine the independent and joint associations of sedentary time and
physical activity with cardiometabolic health markers using thigh-worn accelerometers in a large
population-based cohort.

Methods
Sample and Design
Data for the present study were drawn from the age-46 wave of the 1970 British Cohort Study
(BCS70). The rationale and sampling methods used in the BCS70 are described in detail elsewhere (15). In
brief, BCS70 is an observational prospective population-based cohort study, following the lives of 17,287
people born in a single week of 1970 in England, Scotland, and Wales. In 2016, a new wave at age-46 was
conducted, which comprised paper-based questionnaires to collect the self-reported information via
interviews during the first home visit. Nurses conducted physical examinations and placed the activity
monitor on participants during the following visit. The present study includes cross-sectional analyses from
the participants who completed the age-46 wave. All participants gave written informed consent, and the
age-46 biomedical survey received ethics from NRES Committee South East Coast - Brighton & Sussex
(Ref 15/LO/1446).

Measurements
Demographics and contextual variables
Paper-based questionnaires were used to collect information on educational attainment, self-rated
general health, disability/limitations, medication history, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The
disability/physical limitation was assessed using the European Statistics on Income and Living Conditions
(EU-SILC) (16), and the alcohol intake was evaluated using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test
– Primary Care Version (AUDIT-PC) (17).
Cardiometabolic health markers
During the home visit, a nurse conducted anthropometric tests, blood pressure measurement, blood
sampling, and current medication status records for each participant using standard protocols described in

medRxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/19009738; this version posted October 22, 2019. The copyright holder for this preprint (which was

detail in the BCS70 age-46 wave user guide (ref). Anthropometry tests included height, weight, body-fat
percentage, and waist/hip circumference. Body Mass Index (BMI) was derived as weight (kg) divided by
squared height (m2), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was computed as the quotient of waist circumference to
hip circumference. Both diastolic (DBP) and systolic (SBP) blood pressure were accessed via triplicate
measurements. A nurse collected non-fasting blood samples from consenting participants for analyzing
glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), total cholesterol (TC),
triglycerides (TG), and c-reactive protein (CRP).
Sedentary behavior and other physical activity variables
Sedentary time and physical activity were measured using a thigh-worn activPAL3 monitor (PAL
Technologies, Glasgow, UK) according to the protocol for large scale studies defined by Dall et al. to ensure
compliance with thigh worn devices (18). The device is a triaxial accelerometry that provides estimated
body posture (sitting/reclining/lying, standing) and stepping speed (cadence) based on acceleration
information with a sampling frequency of 20 Hz. The wear protocol has been described in detail elsewhere
(10). Briefly, at the end of a nurse home visit, a nurse waterproofed and fitted the device on the anterior
midline of a participant’s right thigh as recommended by the manufacturer. Participants were asked to wear
the device for seven consecutive days without removing it at any time. Participants were asked to return the
device using self-addressed envelopes provided by the nurses. After the device was returned, data was
downloaded and processed through activPAL3 software and a previously validated open-access program
that quantifies non-wear waking times (https://github.com/UOL-COLS/ProcessingPAL/releases/tag/V1.0)
(19). The first-day of data were excluded, and subsequent days were defined as the 24 hours between
consecutive midnights. Only participants providing at least one valid day, defined as waking wear time
more than 10 hours per day, were included for further analysis (13).

Sedentary behavior and physical activity variables
Daily sedentary time (classified as bouts lasting <30 min, 30-60 min, and >60 min), and breaks in
sedentary time (number of sit-stand transitions) were calculated using the algorithm program mentioned
above (18,19). In the absence of established standards to define prolonged sedentary bouts, both ≥ 60
minutes and ≥ 30 minutes of continuous sedentary time were used as a cutoff (14). Daily time spent in PA
of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was computed using the previously validated program
based on cadence (18,20). To compare the demographics and contextual characteristics, participants were
divided into three groups based on the tertiles of daily sedentary time. To perform joint association analysis,
both daily sedentary time and MVPA time were dichotomized into high and low groups based on median
cut points for each behavior. The resulting joint variable comprised four categories of sedentary time and
MVPA.
Cardiometabolic health markers
CRP was log-transformed as the variable displayed a skewed distribution (21). We calculated the
total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio by dividing TC to HDL-C since this ratio has been shown to reflect more
informative lipid profile and more predictive of cardiovascular risk (22). A constant was added to the
variable for those on medicine (22), i.e., on lipid-lowering drugs (+25% for TC; −5% for HDL-C; 18% for
TG), on BP-lowing drugs (+10 mmHg for DBP and SBP, respectively), and on oral medication for type 2
diabetes (+3.2% for HbA1c).
Potential confounders
Sex, education, total waking wear time, self-rated general health, disability/limitations, smoking, and
alcohol consumption were used to adjust the statistic models as potential confounders (23). Medication uses
were corrected by calculation mentioned above.

We defined continuous exposures in the present study as sedentary time, breaks in sedentary time,
and intensity-specific PA time, with categorical exposures as two sedentary time groups and two MVPA
time groups based on each median, while continuous outcomes as BMI (kg/m2), body fat (%), WHR,
HbA1c (% of total hemoglobin), TC (mmol/L), HDL-C (mmol/L), TG (mmol/L), CRP (mg/L), SBP
(mmHg), total-to-HDL cholesterol ratio, while binary outcomes included hypertension (identified from
physician diagnosis and/or SBP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 80 mmHg) and diabetes (identified from
physician diagnosis and/or HbA1C ≥ 6.5%).
All tests were performed using SAS 9.4 software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA) and were twosided. Data was shown in mean with either standard deviation or 95% confidence interval as applicable. To
examine the differences of demographics and contextual characteristics between tertiles of daily sedentary
time, and chi-square tests, ANOVA, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were conducted as applicable. Multiple linear
regression analyses were used for continuous exposures and outcomes. Multiple logistic regression analyses
were utilized for continuous exposures and binary outcomes. General linear models were performed for
independent/joint categorical exposures and continuous outcomes with Bonferroni-corrected pairwise
comparisons.

Results
The age-46 wave recruited 12,368 participants from BCS70 cohort members for either the dress
rehearsal or the main stage and collected 8,581 productive cases after interviews (Fig. 1). Among those,
7,888 completed home visits, and 6,060 consented to the enrolment of the accelerometry-based
measurement. Eight hundred and sixty-two participants were excluded due to unusable data, and another
560 were excluded because of missing covariates data. A total number of 4,634 participants were available
for further analysis prior to biomedical data exclusions. Table 1 presents the characteristics of the sample
by tertiles of daily sedentary time. Male, smoking, degree-educated, poor health self-rated, disability,
obesity, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension were characteristics associated with higher daily sedentary time.
Association between cardiometabolic health markers and daily sedentary time
As Table 2 shows, after adjusting for potential confounders and MVPA, daily sedentary time was
positively associated with TG (β=0.052 [0.015, 0.089]) but inversely associated with HDL-C (β=-0.015 [0.022, -0.010]). Daily sedentary time was not significantly associated with HbA1c, log CRP, and SBP.
However, when considering daily prolonged sedentary time (≥ 60 minutes) as an independent variable,
prolonged sedentary time was positively associated with both HbA1c and log CRP (β=0.240 [0.030, 0.440]
and 0.026 [0.007, 0.045], respectively) but inversely associated with SBP and HDL-C (β=-0.450 [-0.760, 0.150] and -0.013 [-0.022, -0.003], respectively).
Association between daily sit-stand transitions and cardiometabolic health markers
Table 3 presents the results of the regression models investigating the association between daily
sit-stand transitions and cardiometabolic health markers. After adjusting for potential confounders, daily
sit-stand transitions were inversely associated with HbA1c (β=-0.020 [-0.037, -0.003]) but positively
associated with both TG and SBP (β=0.006 [0.002, 0.010] and 0.030 [0.002, 0.050], respectively). These
associations persisted after further adjusting for total daily sitting time. However, there was no association
of daily sit-stand transitions with HDL-C and log CRP once the models were adjusted for all confounders.

Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the most extensive and largest cross-sectional study using thigh-worn
accelerometry to investigate the joint and independent associations of sedentary time and physical activity
with key markers of cardiometabolic health in an established population-based cohort. Using a novel
postural allocation technique, we found that prolonged sedentary time was adversely associated with
various biomarkers.
Different sedentary patterns and their associations with cardiometabolic health
Although the adverse health effect of sedentary time has been widely suggested, the roles of
different sedentary patterns are still controversial. Our findings suggested that total sedentary time was
adversely associated with TG and HDL-C but not associated with other selected cardiometabolic health
markers. Inconsistent with this study, systematic reviews of cross-sectional studies using wrist/waist-worn
accelerometry have shown discrepant results of associations of total sedentary time with HDL-C and blood
glucose despite conclusive adverse associations with insulin and TG (24,25). However, systematic reviews
and meta-analyses based on prospective cohort studies showed harmonious results on the detrimental
associations of total sedentary time with type 2 diabetes, all-cause mortality, and CVD-related mortality
(26–28). These inconclusive results could not only indicate that each measurement method has the different
capability of sedentary time estimation, but also imply the importance of understanding different sedentary
patterns.
Our results further highlighted the importance of the accumulation of prolonged sedentary time,
since only time in prolonged bouts, but not total sedentary time was associated with HbA1c, SBP, and CRP.
Further, to our knowledge, the present study is the first observational study, which is in line with the
laboratory result, i.e., breaks in sedentary time were positively associated with glycemic control (29). While
previous studies using wrist/waist-worn accelerometry generally suggested that the associations between
prolonged sedentary time and cardiometabolic health markers, e.g., HDL-C, would be independent of total

sedentary time (30–34), cross-sectional studies using thigh-worn accelerometry showed discordant results
of the prolonged sedentary bouts (14,35). Since wrist/waist-worn measurement could not distinguish
different stationary behaviors (5), existing concordant results could arise from pooling both sitting and
standing as a single exposure. The definition of a prolonged sedentary bout in the present study was
accumulation of a sedentary posture continuously for over 60 minutes. Other studies using less prolonged
periods, such as 30 minutes (14), found no associations of prolonged sedentary time with both BP and
HbA1c. On the other hand, van der Berg et al. (12) used the 30-min cutoff but defined the number of
prolonged boats as the exposure, concluding that the prolonged sedentary bouts were not associated with
either the metabolic syndrome or glucose metabolism. These discordant results might indicate that further
research is needed to determine a specific cutoff and to investigate the potential dose-response relationship
(36).
Odds for diabetes within daily prolonged sedentary time x weekly MVPA time subgroups
Our study showed no significant joint association of prolonged sedentary time and MVPA with the
odds of diabetes. This is in contrast to the only other study investigating a similar hypothesis using thighworn accelerometry (13); van der Velde et al. suggested that the risk for type 2 diabetes and the metabolic
syndrome was highest in people with low cardiorespiratory fitness combined with either high sedentary
time or low MVPA. Similarly, a meta-analysis of questionnaire-based prospective cohort studies suggested
that a lower level of PA would exacerbate the disadvantageous associations between sedentary time and
hazard ratios of outcomes like all-cause mortality (27). The differences between our study and the two
studies mentioned above might come from two different characteristics of participants. Firstly, average
daily MVPA time in the present study (~1.2 hr/d) greatly exceeded the physical activity recommendation
(37) and the mean MVPA time of the most active subgroups in both previous studies (13,27). The potential
joint association with diabetes risk could be thereby attenuated in the present study. Secondly, the BCS70
age-46 cohort has a low prevalence of diabetes, while the Maastricht study oversampled for participants
with type 2 diabetes. The difference between population bases needs to be considered when interpreting the

differing results. To conclude, the present study suggested that the odds for diabetes was not different
between daily prolonged sedentary time x weekly MVPA time subgroups when participants generally were
very physically active.
Strengths and limitations
A major strength is that our study used thigh-worn accelerometry to continuously record sedentary
time and physical activity in free-living conditions, and allows distinction between postures that other
devices do not (10–12). Another strength is that our sample was from a representative population-based
cohort, increasing the ecological validity of our results. The main limitation of the present study is the crosssectional study design. However, previous intervention studies have demonstrated consistent results that
uninterrupted sedentary time results in adverse changes of cardiometabolic health markers (38), and
prospective epidemiological studies have also shown strong evidence for relationships between sedentary
time and all-cause/CVD-related mortality (28). The direction could be potentially toward cardiometabolic
health outcomes from sedentary exposures. The other potential limitation is residual confounding (13,36),
e.g., CVD history, diet, and light PA, so our results might suffer from potential bias. Finally, all our
exposures were compositional data, and our analysis did not account for this (39).
Conclusion
To the best of our knowledge, this is the largest cross-sectional study using a novel postural
allocation technique to objectively measure different patterns of sedentary time and physical activity in
free-living settings. Our results suggested that only prolonged sedentary time, but not total sedentary time,
was adversely associated with diabetes diagnosis markers, i.e., HbA1c. However, there were no significant
differences in the odds for the presence of diabetes between participants with different prolonged sedentary
time and MVPA combinations. Further studies should be conducted to explore the optimized cutoff of a
prolonged sedentary bout, and to elucidate potential causality and the dose-response relationship. To sum
up, the present study sheds light on the potential relationship between free-living behavior and
