Abstract
Modified constraint-induced movement therapy (mCIMT) improves upper limb (UL) motor execution
in unilateral cerebral palsy (uCP). As these children also show motor planning deficits, actionobservation training (AOT) might be of additional value. Here, we investigated the combined value of
AOT to mCIMT on UL kinematics in children with uCP. Thirty-six children with uCP completed an
UL kinematic evaluation after participating in a 9-day mCIMT camp wearing a splint for 6 hours/day.
The experimental group (mCIMT+AOT, n=20) received 15 hours of AOT, i.e. video-observation and
execution of unimanual tasks. The control group (mCIMT+placebo, n=16) watched biological-motion
free videos and executed the same tasks. We examined changes in motor control (movement duration,
peak velocity, time-to-peak velocity, and trajectory straightness) and movement patterns (using
Statistical Parametric Mapping) during the execution of three unimanual, relevant tasks before the
intervention, after and at 6 months follow-up. Adding AOT to mCIMT mainly affected movement
duration during reaching, whereas little benefit is seen on UL movement patterns. mCIMT, with or
without AOT, improved peak velocity and trajectory straightness, and proximal movement patterns.
These results highlight the importance of including kinematics in an UL evaluation to capture changes
in motor control and movement patterns of the proximal joints.

1. Introduction
The upper limb (UL) motor and sensory deficits in children with unilateral Cerebral Palsy (uCP)
hinder their performance of daily life activities 1. Effective rehabilitation approaches include bimanual
training 2, modified constraint-induced movement therapy 3, or goal-directed training 4. One of the
most popular treatment modalities amongst clinicians and researchers is constraint-induced movement
therapy (CIMT) and its modified versions (mCIMT) 5, due to its proven high effectiveness and its
ability to improve both unimanual and bimanual function 6–9. mCIMT consists of constraining the less
impaired hand while targeting intensive unimanual task-related practice with the more impaired UL
10

.

Apart from motor execution problems, children with uCP may also have difficulties in motor
representation and motor planning 11,12. These deficits can be targeted with Action-Observation
Training (AOT), a novel treatment approach aimed at activating the mirror neuron system. Mirror
neurons are a particular class of visuomotor neurons that discharge both when we execute a particular
motor action, and when we observe another individual executing the same action 13. Through
observation, we learn how to imitate the movements required to perform a specific action, which can
be translated into skill learning. A few studies have already shown the efficacy of AOT in improving
UL sensorimotor deficits in children with uCP 14–18. However, the added value of AOT to a wellestablished rehabilitation approach, such as mCIMT, has not yet been investigated.
Changes in UL sensorimotor function following mCIMT or AOT have been typically evaluated with
clinical scales that rely on an ordinal-based (subjective) scoring system. Three-dimensional motion
analysis (3DMA) provides a quantitative measurement of UL movement patterns of proximal and
distal joints 19–21, highlighting its added value compared to clinical scales 22. Its utility and sensitivity
to identify improvements at joint level after UL surgery and botulinum toxin injections has been
shown 23,24. These improvements were most obvious in the proximal joints (shoulder, scapula or
trunk) for which clinical scales are less sensitive 23. The analysis of waveforms derived from 3DMA
data using Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM1d) has allowed us to accurately map UL deficits in
children with uCP 25. Treatment-induced changes on UL movement pathology require a
comprehensive analysis over the entire waveform of the joint angle, and the use of SPM1d on 3DMA
data will potentially enable us to capture changes in movement patterns after an intensive training
remains unknown.
Although both mCIMT and AOT have individually been shown to be efficient in improving UL
function in children with uCP, it remains unknown whether their combination would be more
effective than mCIMT alone. Furthermore, the comprehensive evaluation of UL movement patterns

obtained with 3DMA could be highly beneficial to capture training-induced changes, especially at the
joint level. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the added value of AOT to mCIMT on
improving UL movement patterns, as measured with UL-3DMA.

2. Results
2.1. Participants
Forty-four children with uCP participated in this study (mean age (SD) 9y6m (1y10m); 27 boys; 9
MACS I, 15 MACS II, 20 MACS III), and were randomized into the mCIMT+AOT (n=22) and the
mCIMT+placebo (n=22). All children completed the intervention. In the mCIMT+AOT group, data of
two children were lost immediately after the intervention. In the mCIMT+placebo group, data of four
children were lost immediately after the intervention and data of two were lost to follow-up, resulting
in a total of 36 children of whom n=20 received mCIMT+AOT and n=16 mCIMT+placebo (Figure
1). Baseline characteristics of the participants are reported in Table 1. All children who received AOT
showed a good compliance to the video observation, based on the number of correct answers to the
video-related questions (median=42/45 correctly answered, interquartile range=5, range 30-45).

2.2. Treatment efficacy
The effects of this RCT will be first reported for between-group differences to evaluate the added
value of AOT to mCIMT. Next, the within-group effects over time will be described for the total
group, to evaluate the effects of mCIMT with or without AOT.

Between-group analysis
Table 2 summarizes the improvement in motor control for each group (mCIMT+AOT vs.
mCIMT+placebo) at every time point (T1, T2, and T3), revealed by the spatiotemporal parameters.
We found no between-group differences at baseline (T1) for any spatiotemporal parameter (all
p>0.05). We found a significant time*group interaction for movement duration during RU (F=3.37,
p=0.04, partial η2=0.17) in favour of the mCIMT+AOT group (F=9.83, p=0.001). In this group, posthoc analysis showed significant improvement at follow-up (T1-T3, p=0.001, d=0.64) (Figure 2). The
mCIMT+placebo group showed no significant improvements in movement duration (p>0.05). No
significant interactions were found for the other spatiotemporal parameters or the other tasks
(p>0.05).

Figure 2. Movement duration during task reach upwards (RU). The mCIMT+AOT group improved
more than the control group. Differences were significant at 6 months follow-up.
A summary of the findings based on the SPM1d analyses of the kinematic waveforms are reported in
Table 3. We found time*group interactions for shoulder (all tasks), scapula (HTS), and wrist (HTS)
kinematics, whilst no time*group interactions were found for the movement patterns of the trunk and
elbow (p>0.05).
For the shoulder, further analysis showed no significant differences in any of the intervention groups
for shoulder rotation (all tasks) and shoulder elevation (RGV). The analysis for shoulder elevation
also showed a time*group interaction (HTS: p=0.02, 0-33% of the movement cycle), whereby the
mCIMT+placebo group performed the task with less shoulder elevation over time (p=0.04, 11-24% of
the movement cycle), whilst the mCIMT+AOT group did not show changes over time (p>0.05, Figure
3B). Post-hoc analyses in the mCIMT+placebo group indicated that the improvements in shoulder
elevation occurred between T1-T3 (p=0.04, 8-24% of the movement cycle), but were not significant
after Bonferroni correction (p>0.017).
We found a time*group interaction for scapula tilting (HTS: p=0.007, 18-100% of the movement
cycle), showing changes over time in the mCIMT+AOT group (p<0.05, 77-85% of the movement
cycle). The increased anterior tilting of the scapula after the intervention (i.e. increased pathological
pattern) normalized again at T3 (Figure 3A).This change was significant only between T2-T3 (cluster
1: p=0.02, 31-41% of the movement cycle; cluster 2: p=0.01, 76-100% of the movement cycle). It is
important to note that the interaction for this joint angle may have been biased by the increased
anterior tilting in the mCIMT+AOT group whilst the mCIMT+placebo group showed decreased
anterior tilting (Figure 3A). Supplementary Figures S1-S12 show the waveforms at different time
points, for each group and for the total group, with additional plotting of normative data from
typically developing children from Simon-Martinez et al (2018) 26.

Lastly, we also found a time*group interaction for wrist flexion-extension (HTS: p<0.05, 7-17% of
the movement cycle). Subsequent analysis in each group indicated increased wrist flexion in the
mCIMT+placebo group (p<0.05, 10-16% of the movement cycle). Although this was not significant
in the post-hoc analyses (p>0.05), visual inspection indicated that this occurred between T1-T2 and
was maintained at T3 (Figure 3C).

Within-group analysis
Both groups improved over time in trajectory straightness and peak velocity (Figure 4). Trajectory
straightness improved during HTS (p=0.04), and a trend was also found for RU and RGV (p=0.07)
with large effect sizes (partial η2=0.15 for both tasks, Figure 4). Post-hoc analyses depicted that these
changes occurred between T1-T3 and T2-T3, although they were not significant (p=0.07, p=0.09,
respectively; Figure 4). Similar results were found for peak velocity, which significantly changed over
time during RU (p=0.01) and RGV (p=0.008), also with large effect sizes (partial η2= 0.23-0.25;
Figure 4). Post-hoc analyses for RU showed significant improvements between T1-T3 (p=0.02) and
T2-T3 (p=0.03). Improvements during RGV were found immediately after the intervention (T1-T2,

time-to-peak velocity (all tasks, p>0.05; Figure 4).

standard errors.
A summary of the results of the main effects are reported in Table 3. At the proximal level we found
changes in trunk axial rotation for HTS (p=0.02, 58-100% of the movement cycle). Post-hoc analysis
showed a trend toward increased external rotation (normalizing the movement pattern) after the
intervention (T1-T2, p=0.03, 64-100% of the movement cycle), which was not maintained at follow
up (T1-T3, p>0.05; T2-T3, p=0.01, 72-100% of the movement cycle) (Figure 5A). We also found
improved lateral flexion during RU (p=0.03, 67-100% of the movement cycle), although post-hoc
analyses did not survive Bonferroni correction (Figure 5B).
Scapula medial-lateral rotation improved for both reaching tasks (RU: p=0.002, 15-100% of the
movement cycle; RGV: p=0.002, 14-100% of the movement cycle). Post-hoc analyses showed no
differences immediately after the intervention (T1-T2, p>0.05), but the children used increased lateral
rotation at follow-up for RU (T1-T3, p<0.001, 22-100% of the movement cycle; Figure 5D) and RGV
(T1-T3, cluster 1: p=0.01, 19-36% of the movement cycle; cluster 2: p=0.003, 45-100% of the
movement cycle; Figure 5C), resembling the usual movement pattern in typically developing children.
There were no changes at the level of the shoulder, elbow or forearm (p>0.05).

3. Discussion
This is the first study investigating the effect of an intensive training approach combining mCIMT
and AOT on UL motor control and movement patterns in a large cohort of children with uCP. The
evaluation included a comprehensive UL kinematic analysis including spatiotemporal parameters and
kinematic joint angles. Furthermore, the analysis with SPM1d permitted an investigation on changes
in UL movement patterns over the entire waveform. Our results showed that the additional value of
AOT was rather small, as measured with 3DMA. The mCIMT+AOT group performed RU

significantly faster than the control group. As to UL movement patterns, we found between-groups
differences mainly between T2-T3 with inconsistent results between groups. For the total group, we
found an improved movement efficiency (peak velocity), a straighter trajectory, and improvements in
trunk rotation and lateral flexion as well as in scapula rotation. These results highlight the importance
of utilizing 3DMA to measure changes in proximal joints after an UL intervention.
What is the added value of AOT to mCIMT on UL kinematics? The combination of
mCIMT+AOT resulted in a shorter movement time during a reaching task compared to those who did
not receive additional AOT. The effect of the video-observation may have paced the rhythm of
movement performance. The further decrease at T3 suggests that the added AOT training may have a
long-lasting effect on movement duration during reaching. However, we did not collect information
related to the child’s UL therapy between T2-T3 and this should be interpreted with caution. The only
study investigating the effect of AOT on UL kinematics compared to placebo was performed in adult
stroke survivors during a period of six weeks 27. In contrast to our study results, they reported
improvements in both groups in average velocity and trajectory straightness after the intervention,
without between-groups differences in outcomes.
Children who received mCIMT+AOT showed increased anterior scapula tilting after the intervention,
which indicated an increased movement pathology 25. Given that the AOT videos only focused on the
hand and the forearm, these increased proximal changes were unexpected and may have occurred at
the expense of an improved grasp, as the children may have focused on improving their grasp
function potentially leading to proximal compensations. However, grasp function is not assessed with
our 3DMA protocol and future studies should include a kinematic evaluation of the grasp after an
intervention, together with an evaluation of proximal joints. The abovementioned preliminary study 27
also pointed toward a limited immediate effect of AOT on UL kinematics in stroke survivors 27, which
is in agreement with our results. Altogether, our results together with those reported by 27, suggest that
AOT may have limited potential in improving the quality of the UL movement patterns in
neurological populations.
What are the effects of mCIMT (with or without AOT) on UL kinematics? After mCIMT, with or
without AOT, children generally performed the UL tasks with higher peak velocity, and a straighter
trajectory, which may reflect improved motor control, resulting from the intensive skill-based practice
in daily life activities. Peak velocity improved in both groups immediately after the intervention, and
gains were maintained at follow-up, which is in agreement with previous studies in uCP after mCIMT
28,29

. Children with uCP typically have a lower peak velocity compared to typically developing

children 19, which has been related to muscle strength deficits 22. Although we cannot directly
conclude this from current study results, the improvement in peak velocity may reflect gains in

muscle force, which is crucial for daily life activities. Time-to-peak velocity, which represents the
movement strategy, did not improve after the intervention. It is known that children with uCP usually
do not show impairments in movement strategy 19,30, hence little improvement of this parameter was
expected. Although it is possible that the tasks that we used were too simple to depict changes in this
parameter. We also found gains in trajectory straightness, which was more pronounced at follow-up.
Robert et al (2013) did report improvements in trajectory straightness immediately after a taskoriented training program of 5 weeks in children with uCP 31. This may suggest that children with
uCP may need more time to improve trajectory straightness and transfer it to their daily life activities.
Whilst improvements in spatiotemporal parameters after mCIMT have been reported, the uniqueness
of this study lays within the additional measurement of UL movement patterns with an evaluation at
three time points and its analyses over the entire waveform. We found improvements in trunk and
scapula movement patterns for the whole group. More specifically, we found a normalization of the
trunk rotation during HTS after mCIMT. Additionally, scapula medial-lateral rotation also normalized
during RU and RGV after the intervention (i.e. increased lateral rotation). These proximal
improvements may highlight an improved neuromuscular control of the surrounding muscles 32.
Adequate proximal control is crucial for an appropriate use of the distal joints 33. To the best of our
knowledge, changes in joint kinematics have not yet been evaluated after an mCIMT intervention in
children with uCP and our results point toward the value of a kinematic evaluation to identify changes
in movement patterns after an intensive training.
In contrast to our expectations, we did not find distal improvements after our intervention at the level
of the elbow and wrist. Whilst some studies have shown changes at the elbow in children with uCP 34
and in adult stroke 35–37, other studies evaluating UL movement quality using e.g. the Melbourne
Assessment 38 have reported no or limited improvements after mCIMT 39,40. These studies highlight
the difficulties in changing the distal pathological movement pattern during daily life activities and
that a longer training period may be necessary. Nevertheless, we did find training-induced changes at
the proximal joints, especially during HTS task, highlighting the responsiveness to change of some
3DMA-derived motor control features (i.e. duration, peak velocity, and trajectory straightness).
In summary, our study showed improvements in motor control after mCIMT, which is in line with the
clearly shown benefits for the distal UL measured with traditional clinical scales 41. However, 3DMA
showed its ability and uniqueness in capturing changes in proximal movement patterns. Mailleux et al
(2017) previously put forward the importance and advantages of combining both clinical and
kinematic UL evaluations, as each contributes in a specific and unique fashion to the identification of
UL problems 22. Integrating both will surely provide a more comprehensive picture of the trainingderived changes and will help clinicians target decomposed problems.

There are some limitations in this study. This study’s sample size was calculated to find
improvements larger than the smallest detectable difference in bimanual performance (measured with
the Assisting Hand Assessment) as a primary outcome measure 42. However, a total sample of 36
children may be insufficient to find improvements in distal UL movement patters after a two-week
intervention. A second limitation of this study relates to the UL-3DMA protocol, as it did not measure
grasp aperture and closure. Other 3DMA protocols measuring grasp and finger movements 29,43 might
be able to capture improvements at these levels. Finally, for both the spatiotemporal characteristics
and the joint movement patterns, we found large individual variability in response to the intervention.
Previous studies have also shown large variation in clinical outcome measures after an mCIMT
intervention 44, suggesting that there might be sub-groups of children who respond better. Although
this has not yet been explored with a kinematic outcome, further analysis could also focus on
identifying responders based on movement characteristics.
Future studies could also include bimanual tasks to evaluate improvements in bimanual coordination
and the transfer of skills from a unimanual to a bimanual level, which has received very little attention
in research 45. The use of SPM1d in this study has shown its ability to map treatment-dependent
changes in uCP and could be included also in studies including kinematics during bimanual tasks. In
addition to bimanual coordination, it would be interesting to include muscle activity measures (i.e.
electromyography), which will allow for a more comprehensive understanding of the changes at the
muscle activity level. Furthermore, the investigation of muscle synergies has been shown to offer
insights into the complexity of motor control in uCP 46,47.
In conclusion, adding AOT to mCIMT mainly affects movement duration during reaching, whereas
little benefit is observed on movement patterns. However, independent of AOT, mCIMT improved
motor control parameters and proximal movement patterns, which are important to stabilize the UL to
exert a coordinated, effective and smooth movement. This study adds to the available literature on
intensive therapies in uCP and highlights the importance of including 3DMA in the UL evaluation to
capture changes in motor control at proximal joints. Furthermore, we contributed to the identification
of specific outcome parameters and tasks sensitive to change, advancing the clinical implementation
of UL-3DMA.

4.1. Study population and randomization
Children with uCP aged 6-12 years were recruited via the CP reference centre of the University
Hospitals Leuven. Children were included if they had a score between 4 (i.e. poor active assist) and 8
(i.e. spontaneous use) according to the House Functional Classification (HFC) scale 48, and sufficient
cooperation to complete the test procedure. Exclusion criteria were UL surgery 2 years prior to testing
or UL botulinum toxin A injections 6 months prior to testing. Between 2014 and 2017, we organized
seven summer camps in which the children were prospectively enrolled. Participants were first
stratified according to the HFC scale (4–5 vs. 6–7), age (6-9y vs. 10–12 y), and the type of
corticospinal tract wiring pattern (contralateral, bilateral and ipsilateral as measured with transcranial
magnetic stimulation). Next, participants were allocated to the experimental (mCIMT+AOT) or the
control (mCIMT+placebo) group, by using a permuted block design of two.
4.2. Intervention
The intervention was delivered in a day camp model for 9 out of 11 consecutive days (6 hours/day,
total of 54 hours of therapy), with no therapy during the weekend. To guarantee individual guidance,
the therapist-child ratio was 1:1. A team of experienced paediatric physiotherapists led the camps,
assisted by paediatric physiotherapy master students. During the camp hours, all children wore a
tailor-made hand splint on the less impaired hand while performing unimanual exercises during
individual therapy or group activities, and during the AOT or placebo condition.
The individual therapy (9h) was based on motor learning principles of shaping and repetitive
practice focussing on: (1) active wrist and elbow extension, (2) forearm supination, (3) grip strength,
and (4) fine motor tasks. These goals were embedded in functional tasks, which were tailored to meet
the child’s therapeutic needs and adapted according to the child’s progress. The group activities
(30h) consisted of painting, crafting, cooking, and outdoor games, specifically selected to stimulate
the intensive use of the more-impaired hand. Children assigned to the mCIMT+AOT group received
15 AOT sessions (each lasting 1 hour), during which they watched video sequences showing
unimanual goal-directed actions from the first-person perspective. All actions were adapted to the UL
functional level of the child (see Additional files 1 and 2 of 42). The action was observed for 3 minutes
and afterwards executed for 3 minutes, which was repeated twice per action, totalling six actions per
session. The children in the mCIMT+placebo group played video games without biological motion
(15h). Afterwards, the therapist explained the action and the child executed it for 3 minutes. To assure
attention, a yes/no question related to each video activity was asked after the second execution of each
activity (e.g. is the box taken from the top? Did you see the palm of the hand?). At the end of the
intervention, the number of correct answers were summed up, ranging from 0 (all answers incorrect)
to 45 (all answers correct).

4.3. Evaluation
The evaluation consisted of an UL-3DMA, based on a protocol specially developed for children with
uCP 21,22. The protocol has shown to be reliable and valid, and full protocol details can be found
elsewhere 21,42. Seventeen reflective markers were mounted on the trunk, acromion, upper arm,
forearm and hand to record UL motion with 12-15 Vicon infrared cameras (Oxford Metrics, Oxford,
UK) sampling at 100 Hz. Children sat in a custom-made chair that allowed standard sitting with foot
and back support. We identified the anatomical landmarks of interest with static calibration trials
following the International Society of Biomechanics guidelines 49. The movement protocol included
three tasks: reaching upward (RU), reach-to-grasp vertical (RGV), and hand-to-shoulder (HTS),
which are highly discriminative in children with uCP 25. Children were instructed to perform each task
four times at self-selected speed, in two different trials, resulting in 8 movement repetitions per task.
Children were evaluated right before (T1) and after (T2) the intervention, as well as at 6 months
follow-up (T3). LM and CSM conducted the UL-3DMA evaluations.
4.4. Data processing
Offline data processing was performed using Vicon Nexus software (version 1.8.5, Oxford Metrics,
Oxford, UK) and included a Woltring filtering routine with a predicted mean squared error of 10 mm2
50

, gap filling, and selection of the movement cycles (start and endpoints). Only the middle two

repetitions of each trial were time-normalized (0-100%) and used for the kinematic analysis. The open
source software U.L.E.M.A v1.1.9 21,51,52 was used to retain the three cycles with the lowest root mean
square error for the computation of spatiotemporal parameters and joint kinematics. Spatiotemporal
parameters were extracted from the central hand marker and included movement duration (seconds),
peak velocity (m/s), time-to-peak velocity (% of the cycle), and trajectory straightness (unit less). A
higher peak velocity indicates greater force or impulse during the movement. An earlier time-to-peak
velocity points to the used movement strategy, dividing the movement in ‘before’ (time spent during
the first visually triggered outward movement) and ‘after’ the peak velocity (the second half of the
movements requires more precision to be successful) 53. Lastly, trajectory straightness indicates
movement efficiency. Kinematic joint angles were calculated for the trunk (axial rotation, lateral
flexion, and flexion-extension), scapula (medial-lateral rotation, tilting, and pro-retraction), shoulder
(internal-external rotation, elevation plane, and elevation), elbow (flexion-extension and prosupination), and wrist (flexion-extension).
4.5. Statistical analyses
Spatiotemporal parameters were checked with the Shapiro-Wilk test and their histograms were
checked for symmetry. Descriptive statistics are reported as mean and standard errors of the mean. A

repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (rmANOVA) was conducted to evaluate changes over time
(T1, T2, and T3) and between groups (mCIMT+AOT vs. mCIMT+placebo). The time*group
interaction was included in the model to explore potential different time trends between groups. In
case of a significant interaction, time trends were investigated separately per group. Otherwise, time
trends were further investigated in the whole group. The alpha-level for interaction and main effects
for the spatiotemporal parameters was set at 0.05, with a post-hoc Tukey HSD correction. Effect sizes
are reported for the comparison of the spatiotemporal parameters as partial η2 in the rmANOVA
models (small 0.01; medium 0.06; large 0.14) 54,55 and as Cohen’d effect sizes in the pair-wise
comparisons (small, 0.2–0.5; medium, 0.5–0.8; large>0.8) 55. The statistical analysis of the
spatiotemporal data was performed in SPSS (version 25.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).
The waveform analysis of joint angles was conducted using the Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM)
for 1 dimensional data toolbox (SPM1d, version 0.4 for Matlab, available for download at
http://www.spm1d.org/Downloads.html) 56. SPM1d allows for hypothesis testing over the entire
spectrum by considering the interdependency of the data points using random field theory and thus
reduces the risk of type I errors. For every joint angle, the waveforms are compared using the
conventional univariate statistic of an rmANOVA, outputting a statistical curve (F-curve). Next,
random field theory is applied to estimate the critical threshold above which only 5% of equally
smoothed random data is expected to cross (α<0.05). When clusters (i.e. differences between groups
or over time) are identified, the location, extent, and a single p-value is extracted. Clusters smaller
than 5% of the movement cycle are not reported due to little clinical relevance. For every joint angle,
we first tested the time*group interaction to evaluate different time trends between groups. If the
interaction was significant, time trends were investigated in each group. Otherwise, time trends were
investigated for the whole group. For the SPM1d post-hoc comparisons, alpha-level for interaction
and main effects was set at 0.05, and Bonferroni-corrected for post-hoc analysis (division by the
number of comparisons (i.e. 0.05/3)).
