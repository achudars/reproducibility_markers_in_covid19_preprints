Abstract:
Aim: To determine associations between 2-year language outcomes and near-term equivalent age
diffusion MRI (dMRI) white matter tract metrics in a cohort of preterm children. Method: 32
children, gestational age 28.9 (2.4) weeks, underwent dMRI at mean post-menstrual-age
36.4 (1.4) weeks and language assessment with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development–III at
18-24 months. Mean fractional anisotropy (FA) was calculated for 6 white matter tracts.
Hierarchical linear regression assessed associations between tract FA, moderating variables, and
language. Results: Language outcomes correlated positively with FA of the left inferior
longitudinal fasciculus (ILF-L) (r = 0.44, p < 0.05), and negatively with FA of the posterior
corpus callosum (r = -0.41, p < 0.05). Language-brain associations in the ILF-L were
independent of the number of neonatal medical complications. Number of neonatal medical
complications moderated the relationship between language and posterior corpus callosum FA.
Interpretation: The findings suggest that microstructural properties of white matter tracts in the
newborn period are associated with language outcomes in the toddler years. The direction of
associations varied by fiber group and may relate to the stage of brain maturation and/or the
nature and timing of medical complications related to preterm birth.

INTRODUCTION
Children born preterm (PT) are at risk for expressive and receptive language deficits
(Barre, Morgan, Doyle, & Anderson, 2011; Foster-Cohen, Edgin, Champion, & Woodward,
2007; Spek, Franken, & Weisglas-Kuperus, 2012). Language deficits in PT children increase risk
for later reading problems, (Wocadlo & Rieger, 2007) which, in turn, are associated with
adolescent health behaviors, and long-term academic and occupational success (Connor, Alberto,
Compton, & O’Connor, 2014; Sanders, Federico, Klass, Abrams, & Dreyer, 2009). Efforts to
understand the neurobiological basis for early language development in PT children may suggest
avenues of intervention to improve language skills.
PT infants are at risk for white matter alterations (Volpe, 2009). Between 24 and 32
weeks gestational age (GA), pre-oligodendrocytes, the immature progenitors of myelinating glial
cells (ie.,oligodendrocytes), are susceptible to oxidative stress from hypoxia, ischemia, and
inflammation, often failing to mature or myelinate properly (Volpe, 2009). Periventricular
regions are particularly sensitive to oxidative stress-related injuries (Volpe, 2009). Diffusion
MRI (dMRI) has become a preferred method for assessing and characterizing the properties of
white matter pathways in the brain (Basser & Pierpaoli, 1996; Feldman, Yeatman, Lee, Barde, &
Gaman-Bean, 2010). Common dMRI metrics used to index white matter microstructure are
fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Within white matter voxels, increased FA
and decreased MD are generally associated with favorable neurobiological factors, such as
increased myelination and axonal density. However, dMRI metrics are also sensitive to
additional structural and tissue properties that reduce FA and/or increase MD, including the
proportion of crossing fibers within a voxel, axonal size, and membrane permeability (Jones &
Cercignani, 2010). Evidence for lower FA and/or higher MD in dMRI studies of PT neonates
performed at n-TEA compared with children born full term, (Ball et al., 2013; Thompson et al.,
2011) is consistent with evidence for reduced myelination and in axonal growth in animal
models of preterm birth (Volpe, 2009).
Studies have examined relations between language and white matter pathway metrics in
school-aged PT and FT children, (Dodson et al., 2018; Travis, Ben-Shachar, Myall, & Feldman,
2016) but few studies have examined similar white matter at near term equivalent gestational age
(n-TEA). Emerging evidence suggests that variability in white matter microstructure obtained
with dMRI at n-TEA relates to later language development in PT children. FA in the left and
right arcuate fasciculi measured at 39-46 weeks was found to be independently associated with
language outcomes at 22 months (Salvan et al., 2017). In a longitudinal cohort of PT children
imaged at n-TEA, 2- and 4-years of age, (Young et al., 2017) slower rate of change of mean and
radial diffusivity in the left internal and external capsules, and slower rate of change of axial
diffusivity in the left posterior thalamic radiation was associated with lower 4-year old language
scores (Bach et al., 2014). Additional studies are required to confirm and expand on these
associations.
Preterm birth-related illnesses, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia, have also been
associated with white matter metrics (Dubner et al., 2019; Shim et al., 2012) and with language
outcomes (Singer et al., 2001). The degree to which PT children experience neonatal medical
complications varies substantially. Studies have yet to determine whether medical complications

of preterm birth, especially those likely to induce hypoxic, ischemia or neuroinflammatory
responses, moderate associations between near-term measures of white matter microstructure
and language outcomes. Examining these relations in detail is pertinent to determining whether
white matter microstructure may be an important early biomarker for language outcomes.
The present study used advanced, anatomically-specific tractography methods to
determine if language outcomes at two years related to variability in white matter microstructure
across multiple language-related white matter tracts at n-TEA in PT children and whether the
number of medical complications moderated any effects. We obtained measures for FA and MD
from white matter pathways commonly implicated in processing linguistic information,
including a dorsal pathway, the left arcuate fasciculus (Arc-L) and two ventral pathways, the left
and right inferior longitudinal fasciculi (ILF-L and ILF-R) and the left and right uncinate
fasciculi (UF-L, UF-R) (Hickok & Poeppel, 2007). Additionally, we examined fiber pathways
traversing the occipital segment of the corpus callosum (CC-Occ) to capture regions susceptible
to injuries from medical complications of PT birth (Dubner et al., 2019; Thompson et al., 2011;
Travis et al., 2019). We hypothesized that language would be associated with white matter
metrics in these tracts, independent of post menstrual age at scan (PMA). In addition, we
hypothesized that the number of neonatal medical complications would moderate the association
in posterior white matter tracts because of their putative susceptibility to oxidative-stress related
injuries.
METHODS
Participants
Children £1500 grams and £32 weeks gestation at birth from the Lucile Packard
Children’s Hospital Stanford Neonatal Intensive Care Unit born between January 2010 and
December 2011 were eligible for this prospective study (Rose et al., 2015). Exclusion criteria
included evidence of genetic disorders or congenital brain anomalies. 102 participants were
recruited, representing 76% of eligible infants. Of this group, 66 had dMRI scans at n-TEA.
Participants were excluded due to T1w scan issues (n = 9), incomplete diffusion scans (n = 1),
excessive head movement (n = 21, see supplementary material), and missing language measures
(n = 3). The final sample was 32 participants.
Clinical variables were obtained via chart review. Additional description of the
participants and outcomes using different analytic strategies was previously reported (Rose et al.,
2015). The experimental protocol was approved by the Stanford University Institutional Review
Board #IRB-13899. A parent or legal guardian provided informed written consent and
participants were compensated for participation in neurodevelopmental assessments.
Procedures
Diffusion MRI Acquisition, Measures, and Analyses
MRI data were acquired on a 3T Discovery MR750 scanner equipped with an 8-channel
HD head coil (General Electric Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK) at the end of routine n-TEA
neuroimaging lasting approximately 25 minutes. Infants were swaddled, fed and typically
remained asleep without sedation during the scan. Results of the conventional MRI scans were
obtained by chart review. The diffusion-weighted sequence, consisting of a 25-drection

diffusion-weighted scan (b = 1,000 s/mm2) with 3 b = 0 scans was repeated twice in all but 2
participants. The diffusion scan with the least motion was selected for analysis. Imaging
parameters, data preprocessing steps, motion correction procedures, diffusion tensor estimation,
and individual native space tractography are described in the Supplementary Material and
previous publications (Dodson, Travis, Ben-Shachar, & Feldman, 2017; Travis, Adams,
Kovachy, Ben-Shachar, & Feldman, 2017). We analyzed 2 diffusion tensor metrics: FA and MD.
Deterministic tractography, fiber tract identification, segmentation and quantification were
implemented using the Automated Fiber Quantification (AFQ; https://github.jyeatman/AFQ)
software package (Yeatman, Dougherty, Myall, Wandell, & Feldman, 2012) and MATLAB
(MATLAB and Statistics Toolbox Release R2014a, The MathWorks, Inc., Natick,
Massachusetts, United States). White matter pathways for analysis were selected a priori based
on evidence for associations with language skills (Hickok & Poeppel, 2007) (Arc-L, ILF-L and
ILF-R, UF-L and UF-R) or vulnerability to injury in PT children (CC-Occ) as shown in Figure 1
(Dubner et al., 2019; Thompson et al., 2011; Travis et al., 2019). Tract renderings in each
participant were visually inspected prior to statistical analyses to ensure that results of tract
segmentation conformed with anatomical norms. Tract profiles of FA and MD were calculated at
30 equidistant locations along the central portion of each fiber tract bounded by the same two
regions of interest used for tract segmentation. Tract profiles were averaged to produce a single
mean value for each tract.

Neurodevelopmental Assessment
Participants attended the High-Risk Infant Follow-Up program at 18-24 months corrected
age, during which they were assessed on the Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 3rd Edition
(BSID-III) (Bayley, 2006). One participant had follow up at 29.5 months chronological age. Per
clinic protocol, this participant’s BSID-III scores were not corrected for GA, because they were
obtained at ³24 months corrected age. Exclusion of this participant did not change the analysis
results. We analyzed the Language composite standardized score and the Expressive and
Receptive Language subtest scaled scores.
Medical Complications
To assess the contributions of number of medical complications to outcomes, we
generated a composite variable, MedRisk, summing the presence of 6 common medical
complications of preterm birth (intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia,
necrotizing enterocolitis, blood culture proven sepsis, patent ductus arteriosus, and retinopathy of
prematurity). Participants were grouped into low risk (0 risk factors), medium risk (1 risk factor),
and high risk (³2 risk factors).
Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (version 25.0, IBM Corp., 2018).
Statistical significance was set at p < 0.05. The Shapiro–Wilk test was used to assess whether
clinical and neurobiological data were normally distributed. With the exception of PMA, data
were normally distributed. We chose to do parametric tests for all associations. A False
Discovery Rate of 5% was calculated for zero-order associations to account for multiple
comparisons (Benjamini & Hochberg, 1995).
Demographic and Clinical Variables
T-tests were computed to evaluate language outcomes for differences based on sex.
Pearson correlations were computed to evaluate associations between language outcomes or
white matter microstructure metrics, GA and PMA. One-way ANOVA assessed whether
language outcomes differed by MedRisk.
Associations between Language Outcomes and mean White Matter Microstructure Metrics
Pearson correlations were computed to assess zero-order associations between composite,
receptive, and expressive language scores and mean FA or MD. We then conducted a series of
hierarchical linear regression models to assess the contribution of FA or MD to composite
language outcome. We restricted regression analyses to tracts with zero-order correlations with
uncorrected p-values < 0.05. PMA was entered in the models to ensure results were related to
white matter microstructure metrics rather than participant age at scan. We assessed the main
effects of MedRisk and the white matter metrics and then determined if MedRisk group
moderated the prediction of FA to language outcome.(Hayes, 2017) The variance inflation factor
(VIF) was calculated to assess multicollinearity of each model. We considered VIF values less
than 10 to indicate that there was no concern for multicollinearity (Field, 2013).

RESULTS
Participant Characteristics
Participant characteristics, neonatal medical conditions, and language outcomes are
shown in Table 1. PMA and GA were weakly negatively correlated (r = -0.28, p = 0.12).
Clinical MRI scans demonstrated no abnormality (n = 17) or minimal abnormality (n = 14), such
as subependymal hemorrhage or mineralization, (e.g. sequelae of germinal matrix hemorrhage)
with or without mild ventriculomegaly, and with or without mild IVH Grade 1 or 2. One
participant had parenchymal injury. Exclusion of this participant did not change the amount of
variance accounted for by the multivariate models.

Correlations between two-year language outcomes and n-TEA white matter microstructural
metrics
Correlations between language scores and mean FA are shown in Table 4A. Language
composite significantly positively correlated with FA of the ILF-L, and significantly negatively
correlated with FA of the CC-Occ. A moderate, positive correlation with FA of the Arc-L was of
comparable strength, but did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.11). Receptive language
significantly positively correlated with FA of the ILF-L and moderate correlations did not reach
significance with FA of the Arc-L (p = 0.25) and CC-Occ (p = 0.070). Expressive language
significantly positively correlated with FA of the ILF-L and approached significance with the FA
of the Arc-L (p = 0.091).
Correlations between language outcomes and mean MD are shown in Table 4B.
Expressive language significantly positively correlated with MD of the Unc-L only.

Hierarchical multivariable linear regression models
Table 5 shows the results of multiple regression models predicting language outcome at
age 2 from n-TEA FA of ILF-L and CC-Occ, beyond variation accounted for by PMA and
MedRisk. FA of the ILF-L contributed significantly to language composite (Model C), almost
doubling the variance accounted for by PMA and MedRisk (Model B), and accounting for over
40% of the variance. The interaction term was not significant (Model D), indicating that the
relationship between language outcomes at age two and FA of the ILF-L was similar for children
with low, medium, and high MedRisk (Figure 2A). FA of the CC-Occ also contributed
significantly to the language composite (Model G). The interaction of CC-Occ and MedRisk
significantly increased the variance accounted for to about 35% (Model H), indicating that the
relation between language outcomes and n-TEA FA of the CC-Occ was found in the participants
with high- and medium-, but not low- MedRisk (Figure 2B).

complications. B) In the occipital segment of the corpus callosum (CC-Occ), medical
complications moderated the association of FA and composite language score. A relation
between n-TEA CC-Occ FA and language at age 2 was found in the participants with 1, and ³ 2,
but not 0 medical risk factors.
DISCUSSION
In this investigation of 2-year-old children, we evaluated relations between white matter
microstructure metrics from diffusion MRI at near term equivalent age and later language
outcomes, accounting for the moderating effect of number of neonatal medical complications.
The major finding of this study was that at age 2, language development was related to near term
mean microstructural metrics of white matter pathways in a tract belonging to the ventral (left
inferior longitudinal fasciculus) language processing stream. The moderate correlation of
language and a dorsal pathway, the left arcuate fasciculus, may not have reached statistical
significance given the small sample size. In addition, we found that composite language
outcomes significantly negatively correlated with a tract likely to be susceptible to injury from
preterm birth related complications: the occipital segment of corpus callosum. FA of the ILF-L
uniquely contributed to variance in language outcome, beyond the variance accounted for by
clinical course as measured by number of medical risk factors. We identified a moderating effect
of number of medical complications on the association between language and FA in CC-Occ, but
not ILF-L.
The associations between 2-year language outcomes and ventral tracts, are in agreement
with associations between FA of the ILF-L and language in older children born preterm
(Feldman, Lee, Yeatman, & Yeom, 2012; Murner-Lavanchy et al., 2018). The associations may
correspond to consistently reported deficits in receptive language skills in children born preterm
compared with their full term counterparts (Barre et al., 2011). In early language development,
the ventral pathways, including the ILF, are associated with mapping auditory speech sounds to
meaning and simple syntactic structure processing (Hickok & Poeppel, 2007).

A novel finding was that language outcomes were negatively associated with n-TEA FA
of the occipital segment of the corpus callosum, a white matter region prone to injury in children
born preterm, and not traditionally associated with language (Thompson et al., 2011). The
correlation may indicate that FA in posterior periventricular regions indexes general white matter
health or injury. Alternatively, or in addition, at near term, the posterior corpus callosum may be
more relevant to language learning than later in childhood. The observed pattern for negative
correlations within the posterior callosal pathway is consistent with reported negative
associations between FA and readings skills in older preterm children (Dubner et al., 2019) and
individuals born full term (Dougherty et al., 2007; Frye et al., 2008; Hasan et al., 2012; Huber,
Henriques, Owen, Rokem, & Yeatman, 2019; Odegard, Farris, Ring, McColl, & Black, 2009).
Diffusion metrics including FA and MD index multiple tissue properties including but not
limited to myelin (Basser & Pierpaoli, 1996; Jones & Cercignani, 2010). Thus, the observed
white matter-language relations in the CC-Occ may also reflect variations in axonal properties,
such as fiber densities, (Huber et al., 2019) fiber coherence or increased axonal diameter, that
have been shown to occur in different proportions across regions of the corpus callosum
(Aboitiz, Scheibel, Fisher, & Zaidel, 1992). Future studies employing MRI techniques more
specific to myelin and to axonal properties are required to clarify the relations between tissue
properties across regions of the corpus callosum and later outcomes in children born preterm.
FA of the ILF-L explained additional variance in language beyond number of medical
complications. We speculate that the unique contribution of white matter microstructure and the
absence of moderation by medical complications in this pathway may relate to the importance of
the maturational state of oligodendrocyte precursors relative to the timing and location of
oxidative-stress induced brain injuries. For example, prolonged myelination of the ILF (Dubois
et al., 2014) may reduce the susceptibility of such regions to injury in the neonatal period.
Meanwhile the number of medical complications moderated the tract-language association in the
posterior corpus callosum, with greater contribution of FA of the CC-Occ to prediction of
language in children with more complications. The posterior corpus callosum myelinates earlier
(Dubois et al., 2014) and is in a region more prone to injury in the neonatal period. A child with
more medical complications in the neonatal period may have greater injury to oligodendrocyte
progenitors (Volpe, 2009) in the posterior periventricular region. Our findings suggest that
preterm children with fewer medical complications may rely primarily on language-related white
matter pathways similar to full term children. For children with more medical complications,
white matter may be more widely affected and therefore regions beyond traditional language
pathways may contribute to variation in language development.
Limitations of the study include a modest sample size. We used a stringent motion
criteria that, while useful in research, may limit direct applicability to the clinical setting. We did
not have information about other variables associated with language outcomes, such as
socioeconomic status (SES). Children with more medical complications may have been born to
mothers with lower SES, which may be the true moderator of the relation between occipital
corpus callosum FA and language. We used a simplistic measure of neonatal illness to group
participants. While conditions such as necrotizing enterocolitis, bronchopulmonary dysplasia,
sepsis, and intraventricular hemorrhage contribute to hypoxia, ischemia, and inflammation, the
exact mechanism by which these conditions lead to changes in white matter metrics is unknown.

These major medical complications may directly affect white matter or they may be a proxy for
other disturbances such as prolonged poor nutritional status. Medical complications may also be
a marker for other environmental influences associated with altered white matter microstructure,
such as increased number of painful procedures (Vinall et al., 2014). These related endogenous
or exogenous insults may be the ultimate culprits affecting white matter development.
CONCLUSION
In summary, a sensitive tractography method identified relations between language skills and
n-TEA dMRI metrics of a specific ventral language processing stream white matter tract
independent of the number of neonatal medical complications. In addition, neonatal medical
complications moderated the relations between white matter microstructure metrics in the
posterior corpus callosum, suggesting that the white matter properties associated with language
outcomes may vary by fiber group, and relate to location and stage of myelination at injury and
at the time of scan. Further in-depth exploration of neonatal clinical experiences and white
matter pathways will contribute to understanding brain-language associations in the aftermath of
preterm birth. A nuanced understanding of white matter microstructure in the neonatal period
may be necessary to identifying imaging biomarkers for early identification of children at risk for
adverse language outcomes.
