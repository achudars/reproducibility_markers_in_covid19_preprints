ABSTRACT
PURPOSE
Risk-stratified breast cancer prevention requires accurate identification of women at sufficiently
different levels of risk. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of a model integrating
classical risk factors and a recently developed 313-variant polygenic risk score (PRS) to predict
breast cancer risk.
METHODS
Fifteen prospective cohorts from six countries with 237,632 women (7,529 incident breast cancer
patients) of European ancestry aged 19-75 years at baseline were included. Calibration of fiveyear risk was assessed by comparing predicted and observed proportions of cases overall and
within risk categories. Risk stratification for women of European ancestry aged 50-70 years in
those countries was evaluated by the proportion of women and future breast cancer cases
crossing clinically-relevant risk thresholds.
RESULTS
The model integrating classical risk factors and PRS accurately predicted five-year risk. For
women younger than 50 years, median (range) expected-to-observed ratio across the cohorts was
0.94 (0.72 to 1.01) overall and 0.9 (0.7 to 1.4) at the highest risk decile. For women 50 years or
older, these ratios were 1.04 (0.73 to 1.31) and 1.2 (0.7 to 1.6), respectively. The proportion of
women in the general population identified above the 3% five-year risk threshold (used for
recommending risk-reducing medications in the US) ranged from 7.0% in Germany (~841,000 of
12 million) to 17.7% in the US (~5.3 of 30 million). At this threshold, 14.7% of US women were
re-classified by the addition of PRS to classical risk factors, identifying 12.2% additional future
breast cancer cases.

CONCLUSION
Evaluation across multiple prospective cohorts demonstrates that integrating a 313-SNP PRS
into a risk model substantially improves its ability to stratify women of European ancestry for
applying current breast cancer prevention guidelines.

INTRODUCTION
Clinical guidelines for breast cancer prevention and early detection use risk thresholds to identify
women eligible for interventions, e.g., genetic counseling, tailored screening, risk-reducing drugs
or surgery.1-3 Risk assessment under these guidelines can be based on age, family history of
cancer, mutation status for breast cancer genes such as BRCA1 and BRCA2, history of benign
breast disease, and other risk factors. Several risk models are available to estimate absolute risk,
each including different sets of risk factors and aimed at different clinical scenarios.4,5 For
instance, family-based models using pedigree-level information on family history of cancer and
mutation testing are typically used for genetic counseling of women in cancer genetics clinics,
whereas models with more limited family history information and personal risk factors are often
used to identify women for referral to genetic or oncology clinics. Many of these models are
used clinically with limited evidence on their comparative performance across populations.6-8
Additionally, there is a need to improve the risk discrimination of current models, particularly
those assessing risk in the general population.
Polygenic risk scores (PRS) based on common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),
identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS)9 can provide improved risk stratification
of breast cancer, i.e., allow accurate identification of higher proportion of populations at the
extremes, compared to other risk factors for women with or without family history.8,10-14 Risk

assessment using PRS is already commercially available and marketed to clinicians.15,16
However, while PRSs alone have been demonstrated to provide accurate relative risks for breast
cancer in women of European ancestry,17 evidence on the accuracy of predicted risk from models
integrating PRS and classical risk factors in prospective cohort studies is very limited.7,8,11,16,18
Thus, there is an urgent need for this type of assessment in large cohorts across multiple
populations.
Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimator (iCARE) is a new flexible tool19 to develop
and validate risk prediction models in the general population. The iCARE models for breast
cancer based on classical risk factors showed similar or better prediction accuracy and
discrimination compared to two commonly used models in research and clinical settings,
BCRAT and IBIS, in two large prospective cohorts.8 The current study aims to conduct an
extensive independent validation of iCARE-based models that integrate classical risk factors and
a 313-SNP PRS17 in 15 prospective cohorts across six countries. We also examined risk
stratification of these models by estimating five-year risk projections in those countries. Finally,
we provided projections for improved levels of risk stratification attainable by PRSs expected to
result from ongoing efforts to double the size of current breast cancer GWAS.20

METHODS
Study Populations
Eligible person-time within the 15 cohorts began at the time of DNA collection for women of
self-reported European ancestry aged 18-75 years with no personal history of breast cancer, who
consented for genetic studies and completed a risk factor questionnaire. For studies with multiple
questionnaires, we used those administered closest to DNA collection (Table S1). There was a

wide range of variation in the year and average age of DNA collection across the populations
(Table S1). The distribution of risk factors varied substantially across the cohorts (Tables S2-S3),
across the underlying country-specific reference populations, and between cohorts and the
reference population within the same country (Tables S4-S5).
Risk Models
We used iCARE to build models for five-year absolute risk of developing breast cancer19
integrating classical risk factors and PRS (Figure 1). Age was used as the timescale in disease
incidence modeling. The conditional age-specific incidence rates given the risk factors were
assumed to follow a Cox proportional hazards model.21 Classical risk factors in the iCARE-Lit
model were specified as previously described.8 Briefly, this model includes ages at menarche and
first birth, parity, height, alcohol intake, breast cancer family history (i.e., presence or absence of
disease in at least one first-degree relative), history of benign breast disease, oral contraceptive
use and BMI for all women. For women 50 years or older it additionally includes age at
menopause, hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use, and current HRT type. The relative risks
for these factors were obtained from a literature review separately for women younger and older
than 50 years (Supplements).8 The 313-SNP PRS, recently described in Mavaddat et al.,17 was
integrated into the iCARE-Lit model assuming a multiplicative joint association with disease
risk, except for family history where we accounted for attenuation of the relative risk due to its
correlation with PRS.
To estimate absolute risk of breast cancer, we incorporated country-specific incidence and
competing mortality rates from population-based registries and the population distribution of risk
factors, using an individual-level reference dataset representative of each population (Figure S1,

Tables S4-S5). We simulated the PRS in the reference dataset assuming independence with
classical risk factors, conditional on family history.19
Cohort-Specific Validation of Risk Models
Women developing incident primary breast cancer, either in-situ or invasive, during the followup period were considered cases (Table S1). Follow-up for all subjects was assumed to begin one
year following study entry to reduce the impact of prevalent cases on validation analyses and
was defined up to the last contact or record linkage to cancer registry or five years, whichever
came first. Predicted risk estimates account for competing mortality due to other causes during
the follow-up period (Figure 1). The model validation methods are discussed in detail in our
previous work8 and the Supplements.
Meta-Analysis of Relative Risk Calibration
We evaluated relative risk calibration of each model through a meta-analysis across cohorts
using the deciles of the relative risk score in UK Biobank as the standard set of cutoffs to
delineate the risk categories. We first computed the relative risks (observed and expected) for
each decile with respect to the fifth decile and combined the estimates using standard inverse
variance weighted meta-analysis22 on the log-relative risk scale. We also computed a metaanalysis estimator and a Wald-statistic based 95% confidence interval (CI) of the AUC based on
all risk factors except age.
Projection of Risk to the General Populations
Projected five-year absolute risks for women of European ancestry aged 50-70 years in each
country were calculated using the population distribution of ages and risk factors in the
corresponding reference dataset, population-specific breast cancer incidence and competing
mortality rates (Figure 1, Supplements). Proportions of women and incident cases expected to

arise within five years were calculated at both extremes of the risk distribution based on two
high-risk thresholds and two low-risk thresholds. Low-risk cutoffs were 0.6% and 1.13%,
corresponding to average five-year risk for US women aged 40 and 50 years, respectively. Highrisk cutoffs were 3%, corresponding to US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation for
risk-lowering drugs2, and 6%, corresponding to a cutoff for very high risk used in the WISDOM
trial.23 We also evaluated expected improvements in risk stratification by incorporating an
improved PRS to the iCARE models (Supplements).

We evaluated potential improvements in risk stratification achieved by adding genetic variants to
the model with classical risk factors in the populations of the UK and the US in terms of
proportions of women and future cases reclassified at the extremes of the risk distribution based
on two low-risk (0.6% and 1.13%) and two high-risk cutoffs (3% and 6%). Women who were at
8% or higher risk, corresponding to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)
guidelines for ten-year risk of a 40-year-old woman in the UK,3 were above 3% five-year risk of
breast cancer.
RESULTS
Meta-analyses of the iCARE-Lit model relative risk scores showed that observed and expected
scores based on the 313-SNP PRS were not significantly different overall, with excellent
calibration across risk deciles (Figure S2). While relative risk scores based on classical risk
factors appeared well calibrated for most cohorts (Figures S3-S5), the meta-analysis showed
45% and 18% overestimation of risk for the highest decile for women younger and older than 50
years, respectively, and 16% underestimation of risk for women in the lowest decile, only in the
older group (Figure S2). The integrated model also appeared well calibrated across cohorts

(Figures S3-S5), and meta-analyses showed good calibration across most risk categories, but a
40% and 27% overestimation in the highest risk decile for the younger and older age groups,
respectively (Figure 2, Figure S2). The analyses for women older than 50 years using a similar
model with relative risk estimates from a multivariable analysis of prospective cohorts (iCAREBPC324) provided somewhat better calibration of models at the high-risk decile (Figure S2,
Figure S6).
For both age groups, incorporating the 313-SNP PRS to the classical risk factors substantially
improved overall risk discrimination (Figure S2). Age-adjusted AUC (95% CI) was 55.9 (53.8 to
58.0) and 64.0 (62.0 to 66.0) for classical risk factors and integrated models, respectively, in
younger women; and 57.3 (56.5 to 58.1) and 64.0 (63.2 to 64.7), respectively, for older women
(Figure 2). However, the differences between the AUCs based on the 313-SNP PRS alone and
integrated models were smaller, with overlap in 95% CIs (Figure S2). All the models showed
improvements in AUC after incorporating the variation due to age at enrollment (Figure 3,
Figures S11-S13).
While calibration of absolute risk for the integrated models varied substantially across cohorts
(Figures 4-5, S7A-S10B), the models did not systematically over- or under-predict risk. The
median (range) expected-to-observed (E/O) ratio across the studies were 0.94 (0.72 to 1.01) for
women younger than 50 years and 1.04 (0.73 to 1.31) for women older than 50 years. For
women at the highest risk decile these were 0.9 (0.7 to 1.4) and 1.2 (0.7 to 1.6) for the two age
groups, respectively.
Risk projections among women of European ancestry aged 50-70 years showed that addition of
PRS to the classical risk factors produced substantial improvements in risk stratification (Figure
6, Tables S7A-S7F), resulting in identifying a large fraction of the population at high or low risk

(five-year risk >3% or ≤1.13%, respectively). These projections vary across populations due to
differences in the distribution of age and classical risk factors. The proportion of women
identified at low risk ranged from 27.0% in the US (~8.1 of 30 million) to 46.0% in Germany
(~5.5 of 12 million). At the high-risk threshold, the proportion of women identified ranged from
7.0% in Germany (~841,000 of 12 million) to 17.7% in the US (~5.3 of 30 million). As a
sensitivity analysis, we adjusted for the miscalibration of risk in the high-risk decile (Figure 2)
by attenuating the risk projections by the amount of overestimation in that category. After this
adjustment, the proportion of women identified at the high-risk threshold ranged from 5.6% in
Germany (~677,000 of 12 million) to 16.7% in the US (~5 of 30 million) (Table S8). Proportions
of future cases identified at high risk also remained substantial after adjusting for the relative risk
miscalibration.
Our projections indicate that incorporating an improved PRS substantially increases the number
of future cases expected to be identified in the high-risk group, with only a marginal predicted
increase in total women in that group. In the low-risk group, an improved model would identify a
substantially higher fraction of total women, with only a minimal number of additional cases
expected (Tables S7A-S7F).
Addition of the 313-SNP PRS to the classical risk factors (Table 1, Table S6) resulted in a
substantial reclassification of women leading to a net increase in the proportion of cases crossing
risk thresholds under current clinical guidelines for breast cancer prevention. For example, for a
five-year risk threshold of 3% recommended for risk-reducing medications in the US, 14.7% of
US women were re-classified by the integrated model, leading to identification of an additional
12.3% of the future breast cancer cases. For the same threshold, the integrated model reclassified
15.3% of UK women, resulting in identifying an additional 15.7% of the future cases.

DISCUSSION
The integrated iCARE-Lit model with 313-SNP PRS and classical risk factors showed
substantial improvements in breast cancer risk prediction across 15 prospective cohorts of
women of European ancestry in six countries. The integrated models generally showed good
calibration and provided wider stratification of population risk, identifying more women crossing
clinically actionable risk thresholds used by current guidelines for breast cancer prevention and
early detection.
The integrated iCARE-Lit model provided well-calibrated relative risk scores across validation
cohorts (Figures S3-S5); however, meta-analyses showed some over-prediction in the highest
risk decile that was driven by the classical risk factor component. The calibration of absolute
risks, however, varied more widely across cohorts, even within countries, though we did not see
evidence of systematic under- or over-prediction across studies. This suggests that differences
across cohorts are likely due to random variation or differences between study populations (e.g.,
wide range of study time periods (1989-2013) and differences in risk factor distributions or
disease rates), rather than a reflection of intrinsic model properties. This highlights the
importance of absolute risk validation across multiple study populations, particularly using
cohorts similar to the target populations, both in chronologic years of study and underlying risk.
Further studies in countries represented here by only one cohort, or not included in this report,
are needed to evaluate country-specific differences in model performance.
We recently showed that five-year risk predictions by the iCARE-Lit model based on classical
risk factors were at least as accurate as two established models used in clinical practice: BCRAT
(“Gail”) and IBIS (“Tyrer-Cuzick”).8 Previous evaluations (e.g., Terry et al. 20196) of BCRAT

and IBIS also showed overestimation of risk in the highest risk categories.25-27 Our analyses
suggested that building models from multivariable analysis of classical risk factors in prospective
cohorts24, rather than from the literature, could improve calibration at the high-risk decile. Thus,
calibration and discrimination of models can potentially improve through efforts of building
multivariate relative risk models in prospective cohorts of women across age groups, and with
more comprehensive information on questionnaire-based risk factors. Addition of risk
biomarkers such as mammographic breast density,11,12,27,28 circulating hormone levels,28-30 or
novel risk factors as they are identified in the future can result in further improvements.
Discriminatory accuracy of risk models may be substantially different in research cohorts than in
target populations due to differences in underlying risk factor distributions. For instance, our
projections show a higher discriminatory accuracy in the US population (AUC = 66.5, Table
S7F, Figure S14) compared to the US-based cohorts (AUC range: 63.1-65.8) (Figures S11-S12).
Our projections also show that an improved PRS, achievable through larger GWAS, could lead
to better risk stratification, with a model integrating risk factors and an improved PRS achieving
an AUC~0.71 (Tables S7A-S7F). This will improve our ability to identify women eligible for
risk-reducing interventions, or supplemental screening by magnetic resonance imaging or other
imaging modalities. However, since the discriminatory performance of models will remain
moderate, most breast cancers will still occur among women not identified at elevated risk. Thus,
broader public health efforts targeting the whole population will continue to be required for
reducing the population burden of breast cancer in a major way.31 Risk-stratified screening
strategies at the population level tailored to women’s individual risks based on integrated models
may improve the effectiveness of population-based screening, relative to the current agestratified programs,32 and is currently being evaluated in screening trials33.

We used country-specific breast cancer incidence rates and a reference dataset for each country,
built from population-based surveys, to translate relative risks to absolute risk estimates over a
specified time period.19 This critical step in building absolute risk models minimizes
miscalibration of absolute risk when models developed for one target population are applied to
other populations or countries. Although most model algorithms allow for changes in default
incidence rates, the underlying risk factor distributions are often implicit and cannot be easily
changed. While this flexibility is a strength of the iCARE modeling approach, it requires the
availability of population-based survey data with information on all risk factors included in the
models for the relevant time periods. We were unable to identify a single data source for the
distribution of all the risk factors in each target population, requiring us to simulate some risk
factors and make various modeling assumptions (e.g., independence of certain risk factors). This
could have affected model performance across study populations. Finally, the reference datasets
enable iCARE models to provide absolute risk estimates for individuals based on a subset of risk
factors in the model.19 This feature adds flexibility to use the models in different settings using
information on a subset of risk factors.
Our risk models are aimed at the general population and do not adequately capture risk for
women with strong family histories or carrying high-risk mutations. This requires integration
with family-based models, e.g., our recent extension of the BOADICEA model13 to include the
iCARE-Lit risk factor component. However, this fully extended model has not yet been
prospectively validated. Although iCARE can be used for risk predictions over any time period,
the current study only evaluated five-year risk prediction, and further work is needed to evaluate
longer-term predictions used by some clinical guidelines.

The iCARE-Lit model includes parameters for atypical hyperplasia, lobular carcinoma in situ
and other benign breast diseases. However, this information was not available from the
participating cohorts, thus further validation is required for risk prediction for women with these
conditions. The iCARE models predict risk of overall breast cancer (i.e., invasive and in situ),
rather than specific subtypes. Because risk factor associations and the effectiveness of preventive
and screening strategies vary by tumor subtypes (e.g., estrogen receptor positive and negative
tumors),34-39 future work on subtype-specific risk predictions could result in more precise
identification of women who would benefit most from specific interventions. Finally, the current
models were derived and evaluated in studies of women of European ancestry and additional
studies are urgently needed to develop and validate models for other populations, for whom
alternative models have only been evaluated in relatively small studies.40-42
In summary, we present extensive validation results of a breast cancer risk prediction model
integrating a newly developed PRS and classical risk factors. We show that it can provide
substantial improvement in risk assessment for application of current clinical guidelines, or
future risk-stratified prevention and screening strategies.43,44

incident cases of breast cancer expected to occur in these groups within a five-year interval. The expected number of women is calculated
using 2017 population estimates (N = 2,960,506) from Australian Bureau of Statistics for Australia, 2016 population estimates (N=12,024,487)
from the Federal Statistical Office for Germany, 2016 population estimates (N = 2,356,691) from the Central Agency for Statistics for the
Netherlands, 2016 population estimates (N=1,249,695) from Statistics Sweden for Sweden, mid-2016 population estimates (N = 8,275,453)
from the Office of National Statistics for the UK and mid-2016 population estimates (N = 30,030,821) from US Census Bureau for the US.
The expected numbers of cases are estimated using the average predicted five-year risk in each population, calculated using the country-

cohorts). Risk categories were defined based on deciles of predicted five-year absolute risk. Classical risk factors include age at menarche, age

specific breast cancer incidence rates and risk factor distributions (Table S4). The 1.13% risk threshold corresponds to the average five-year

medications. Classical risk factors correspond to the iCARE-Lit model and include age at menarche, age at first live birth, parity, oral
contraceptive use, age at menopause, hormone replacement therapy use, type of hormone replacement therapy, alcohol intake, height, BMI,
breast cancer family history (i.e., presence or absence of breast cancer in at least one first degree relative), and benign breast disease.

Table 1. Reclassification of women at high-risk thresholds after incorporating 313-SNP PRS to the classical risk factors. We report the number
of women and future cases (i.e., women expected to develop breast cancer within five-years) above or below the risk threshold based on the
classical risk factors and the number and percentage of these women moving below the threshold (down), above the threshold (up) and a total
number and percentage of re-classified women. Classical risk factors correspond to the iCARE-Lit model and include age at menarche, age at
first live birth, parity, oral contraceptive use, age at menopause, hormone replacement therapy use, type of hormone replacement therapy,
alcohol intake, height, BMI, breast cancer family history (i.e., presence or absence of breast cancer in at least one first degree relative), and
benign breast disease. The 3% cutoff corresponds to the US Preventive Services Task Force recommendation for risk-lowering drugs and the 6%
cutoff corresponds to a cutoff for very high risk used in the WISDOM trial. Abbreviations: AR = absolute risk, PRS = polygenic risk score, SNP
= single nucleotide polymorphism.
