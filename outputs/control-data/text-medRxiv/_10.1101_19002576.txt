Abstract
Non-pathological levels of children’s co-occurring externalizing/internalizing problems in the
school setting are not well characterized. We assessed associations between aggressive behavior
and co-occurring externalizing/internalizing problems among schoolchildren in 39,936 teacher
ratings from 4 population-based cohorts (FinnTwin12 from Finland, Generation R and the
Netherlands Twin Register from the Netherlands, and the Twins Early Development Study from

the UK). Correlations of aggressive behavior were high with other externalizing problems (0.470.80) and lower with internalizing problems (0.02-0.39). A negative association was seen with
prosocial behavior, ranging -0.33 to -0.54. Although the mean levels of aggressive behavior
differed significantly by gender, the correlations of aggressive behavior with co-occurring
behaviors were notably more similar between the genders (e.g., aggressive-hyperactivity
correlations: 0.51-0.75 boys, 0.47-0.70 girls). Comparisons are also discussed with respect to age,
instrument/cohort, and parental ratings. These population-based European observations highlight
the complexity of aggressive behavior at school, and can assist in creating appropriate
interventions.
Keywords: aggression, behavioral problems, comorbidity, teacher ratings, gender differences
Introduction
Aggressive behavior in school is a persistent topic of discussion, with concerns surrounding
bullying, gender- and sexuality-based misconduct, and extreme violence (e.g., school fights,
stabbings, shootings) currently garnering the most attention (UNESCO 2019; OECD 2017).
Although these specific areas of violence and aggression are important to understand and manage
for the safety of all in the school environment, they are but pieces in the larger puzzle of
aggressive behavior in the school setting. Indeed, aggression is a heterogenous behavior that has
been characterized in a variety of ways, including well-researched subtypes such as proactive (i.e.,
planned aggression, such as bullying or stealing), reactive (i.e., in response to some stressor, such
as a bully instigating a confrontation), direct (i.e., yelling, hitting, kicking, verbal threats) and
indirect (i.e., social/relational aggression, such as spreading nasty rumors or ostracizing an
individual) (Pulkkinen 2018; Vitaro et al. 2006). All children express such behaviors to varying
degrees, in time and amount. This complex behavior among school-aged children is associated

with relationship quality among their peers, teachers, and families, as well as their eductional
attainment, risk for substance abuse and other psychiatric disorders, and risk for partipation in
criminal activities (Farrington 1995; Pulkkinen 2017; Whipp et al. 2018).
In studying aggression, gender differences have played a large and complex role in our
understanding of the problem behavior. Early research focused only or mainly on boys, although
studies in recent decades have greatly enriched our knowledge regarding both genders.
Distinctions between direct/physical aggression as being higher among boys and indirect
aggression being higher among girls have generally given way to an understanding that both
genders engage in both types of aggression, and that at least for indirect aggression the gender
differences are negligible (Card et al. 2008; Cleverley et al. 2012). Likewise, a study by Nivette et
al. (2018) indicates that in societies that experience more gender inequality, differences in
physical aggression by gender are minimal.
Complicating our understanding of this behavioral problem further, children with
aggressive behavior often have co-occurring problem behaviors, either externalizing, internalizing
or both (August et al. 1996, Bartels et al. 2018, McNellis et al. 2017, Verhulst et al. 1993, Willner et
al. 2016). Furthermore, children with aggression and co-morbidities often have more than one comorbidity, worse prognoses and poorer outcomes (Fontaine et al. 2008; Pulkkinen 2017; Vaalamo
et al. 2002; Verhulst et al. 1993). Regarding the school setting, research has generally focused on
severe aggression problems (e.g., conduct disorder, oppostional-defiant disorder, bullying),
however, less is known about general, sub-diagnostic levels of aggressive behavior and cooccuring behaviors.
Aggressive behavior is often characterized and studied via parental, self, and mental health
professional assessments, with teacher ratings being used less often in epidemiologic or clinical
research. Research from the past several decades has shown that an individual’s aggressive

behavior may be situational (e.g., present at school, but not at home) and that assessments of
behavioral and emotional problems do not correlate well between raters (mean correlations
between raters from Achenbach 1987 range 0.22–0.28 for different raters (such as parent and
teacher) and 0.60 for similar raters (such as mother and father)) (Achenbach 1987; Verhulst 1994;
De Los Reyes 2005). Furthermore, studies have shown that teacher ratings of problem behaviors
have often been most useful in diagnostics and predictive outcomes, including psychiatric
disorders and criminality (Stanger et al. 1993; Verhulst 1994; Carbonneau et al. 2005; Hodgins et
al. 2013; Whipp et al. 2018). Teachers’ ability to observe children in a complex task-based setting
and among peers of similar age and abilities provides them with a valuable comparison-base,
making their insight unique and important.
This study’s overall objective was to characterize the levels and associations of aggressive
behavior and co-occurring behaviors in the school setting, using teacher ratings of children at ages
7–14. Large datasets from population-based cohorts of children from Finland, the Netherlands,
and the UK were utilized. Specific aims were: 1) to report the mean levels of aggressive and other
behaviors as assessed by teachers and to examine associations of aggressive behavior and cooccurring behaviors and 2) to assess gender differences in the levels and associations of aggressive
behavior and co-occurring behaviors.

Materials and Methods
The datasets for this investigation were obtained through the collaboration of the ACTION
(Aggression in Children: Unravelling gene-environment interplay to inform Treatment and
InterventiON strategies; http://www.action-euproject.eu/) consortium (Bartels et al. 2018).
ACTION’s main goal is to improve our understanding of the causes of the individual differences in
childhood aggression and co-occurring behavioral and emotional problems, with a strong focus on

genetics, epigenetics, and biomarkers, as well as an integrative component concerned with
tailoring prevention and intervention strategies.
Here, we utilized data from four ACTION cohorts –– from Finland, the Netherlands, and the
UK ––with available teacher ratings to address our study aims. In total, the data included 39,936
teacher ratings on children at ages 7, 9, 10, 12, and 14 (48.9% boys). Although cross-sectional in
approach, the longitudinal nature of the cohort data provides some possible overlap of the same
child at two or more age time points. As in Bartels et al. (2018), in the cohorts that include twin
data one twin per family was randomly selected for analysis, and individuals were excluded if they
had an illness or handicap that interfered with their daily functioning, and if they were missing
substantial data from one of the examined subscales from cohort-respective behavioral and
emotional problem questionnaires (see also: http://www.action-euproject.eu/content/dataprotocols). All data in the current investigation were collected under protocols that have been
approved by the appropriate ethics committees, and studies were performed in accordance with
the ethical standards established in the 1964 Declaration of Helsinki and its later amendments.

Cohort descriptions
FinnTwin12 (FT12)
The FT12 dataset was established in Finland from the cohort of twins born 1983–87 (Kaprio
et al. 2013). It is a population-based twin study aimed at examining health-related behaviors and
their precursors. Data were collected at ages 12, 14, 17, and 22. Teacher ratings on behavioral and
emotional problems were collected at ages 12 and 14 using the modified Multidimensional Peer
Nomination Inventory (MPNI) (Pulkkinen et al. 1999). Response rates were 93% and 94% for age
12 and 14 teacher ratings, respectively.

Generation R (GENR)
The GENR Study is a population-based birth cohort, established in the Netherlands from
children born 2002–06 in the city of Rotterdam and surrounding areas (Kooijman et al. 2016),
aimed at examining growth, development and health from fetal life to young adulthood. Data
were collected during pregnancy, at birth, and frequently throughout childhood. Currently, data
are being collected for the mean age 13 years assessment wave. Teacher ratings on behavioral and
emotional problems were collected at child mean age 7 years using the Achenbach System of
Empirical-Based Assessment’s (ASEBA) Teacher Report Form (TRF) (Achenbach 1991); the
response rate was 77%.

Netherlands Twin Register (NTR)
The NTR was established in the Netherlands in 1987. The register includes adults and
young twins who were registered by their parents shortly after birth and who are followed
longitudinally to examine, in particular, behavioral development and psychopathology (Van
Beijsterveldt et al., 2013). Data are collected at ages 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 18 years (at
which point twins move into the adult twin register), with tools including the ASEBA to obtain
information. In school year 1999–2000, the NTR began collecting teacher ratings for 7, 10 and 12
year old twins, with the ASEBA’s TRF (Achenbach 1991); the average response rate was ~60%.

Twins Early Development Study (TEDS)
The TEDS study was established in the UK from the cohort of twins born 1994–96 (Haworth
et al. 2013). It is a UK-representative longitudinal twin study aimed at examining language,
cognitive, and behavioral development. Data were collected at ages 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16,
18, and 21. Teacher ratings on behavioral and emotional problems were collected at ages 7, 9, and

12 using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman 1997); response rates were
85%, 76%, 78%, respectively.

Study questionnaires
Multidimensional Peer Nomination Inventory (MPNI)
The MPNI, used by the FT12 cohort, was originally developed as a tool for rating peers on
childhood social behavior, however, it has been adapted and modified to collect ratings from
parents, teachers, and the twin themself (Pulkkinen et al. 1999). It is a 37-item questionnaire with
the 6 subscales used here being: aggression (6 items), depression (5 items), hyperactivity–
impulsivity (7 items), inattention (4 items), prosocial behavior (12 items), and social anxiety (2
items). Although further subscale scoring was not performed, the MPNI internal structure based
on factor analysis indicates aggression, hyperactivity–impulsivity and inattention subscales as part
of a behavioral problem/externalizing subscale, and depression and social anxiety subscales as
part of an emotional problems/internalizing subscale. Each item on the teacher rating
questionnaire has four response choices: ‘not observed in child’, ‘observed sometimes, but not
consistently’, ‘definitely observed, but is not prominent’, and ‘clearly observed’. Response choices
are scored 0–3, and subscales are formed by taking the mean of all items in the subscale (no
missing values were allowed).

Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ)
The SDQ, used by the TEDS cohort, is a 25-item questionnaire that measures common
childhood mental health problems (Goodman 1997). The five subscales of the SDQ are conduct
problems (5 items), emotional problems (5 items), hyperactivity (5 items), peer problems (5
items), and prosocial (5 items). For this study, we use ‘conduct problems’ as a proxy for aggressive

behavior, and ‘emotional problems’ as a proxy for anxiety problems, as in Bartels et al. (2018).
Although further subscale scoring was not performed, the SDQ does recognize conduct problems
and hyperactivity subscales as part of an externalizing subscale, and emotional and peer problems
subscales as part of an internalizing subscale. Each item on the questionnaire has three response
choices: ‘not true’, ‘somewhat true’, and ‘certainly true’. Response choices range from 0–2 and are
coded so that higher scores represent greater risk for the behavior attribute, and subscale scores
are derived as a scaled mean score when at least 3 of the 5 items in a subscale are non-missing.

Teacher Report Form (TRF)
ASEBA’s TRF, used by the GENR and NTR cohorts, is a 112-item questionnaire that
measures childhood behavioral and emotional problems (Achenbach 1991, 2001; Lamb 2012). The
eight syndrome subscales used here are aggressive behavior (20 items), anxious/depressed (16
items), attention problems (26 items), rule-breaking behavior (12 items), social problems (11
items), somatic complaints (9 items), thought problems (1 item), and withdrawn/depressed (8
items). Although further subscale scoring was not performed, the TRF recognizes aggressive
behavior and rule-breaking behavior subscales as part of an externalizing problems subscale, and
anxious/depressed, withdrawn/depressed and somatic complaints subscales as part of an
internalizing problems subscale. In order to retain comparability across instruments, the attention
problems subscale will also be considered as externalizing for the purposes of this study. Each
item on the questionnaire has three response choices: ‘not true’, ‘somewhat or sometimes true’,
and ‘very true or often true’. Response choices are scored 0–2, and items are summed to created
sum scores of individual subscales. GENR weighted the subscale sum scores for missing values,
while NTR allowed, in accordance with the ASEBA manual, a small number of missing values per

subscale (depending on the total number of items per subscale), replacing the missing values with
the mean item score of that subscale.

Analyses
Data from the FT12, NTR, and TEDS cohorts were analyzed at one site (by AMW) using
Stata version 15 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA), while data from GENR were
analyzed locally (by KB) using R version 3.3.2. The analyses followed a standard operating
procedure (similar to Bartels et al. 2018) to ensure uniform data handling and analysis.
First, means, standard deviations (SD) and standard errors (SE) were obtained for each
subscale of the study questionnaire for each age and cohort, separately by gender. T-tests were
performed for the subscales of each questionnaire to determine if gender differences existed (pvalue <0.05 was considered significant), and effect sizes were calculated as Cohen’s d values (with
positive values indicating boys have larger mean levels than girls and vice versa). Effect sizes are
emphasized over statistical significance since: 1) we are not hypothesis testing and 2) our sample
sizes are large and thus significance is expected for many relationships. Next, Pearson correlations
between the subscales were computed for each age and cohort, separately by gender since
differences were identifed.
Linear regression models were then employed to formally test gender differences and
examine whether gender interactions existed, as well as to assess the amount of variance in
aggression that could be explained by the independent variable (using R2 values). Before
modeling, the subscale scores were standardized (mean=0, SD=1) in order to allow for
comparisons of the same questionnaire across different ages or cohorts (where possible). Initial
modeling included aggressive behavior as the dependent variable and one subscale score as the
independent variable. There were three types of subscale scores utilized in the initial models: 1)

the externalizing problems subscale with the highest correlation with aggressive behavior (e.g.,
hyperactivity, inattention, rule breaking); 2) the internalizing problems subscale with the highest
correlation with aggressive behavior (e.g., anxiety, depression, somatic); and 3) the prosocial
subscale (if available). For each model, the genders were modeled separately, after testing for
gender interactions. Lastly, to examine multiple co-occuring behaviors with aggression, multiple
regression modeling was performed with aggressive behavior as the dependent variable and the
two (or three, if available) subscale measures from the initial models simultaneously modeled as
independent variables, modeled separately for gender after testing for gender interactions.

Results
Overall, we examined 39,936 teacher ratings on children: 3627 observations from FT12,
4512 observations from GENR, 18,569 observations from NTR, and 13,228 observations from
TEDS. Regarding the spread of data at different ages, there were 17,267 observations of 7-yearolds (49.3% boys), 2762 of 9-year-olds (46.9% boys), 6582 of 10-year-olds (49.6% boys), 11,884 of
12-year-olds (48.4% boys), and 1441 of 14-year-olds (48.4% boys). Interactive results can also be
found at (http://www.action-euproject.eu/TeacherRatingsChildAggression).

Average Scores
Across all cohorts, mean levels were higher for boys than girls in all externalizing subscale
scores, with Cohen’s d values ranging 0.31–0.69 (Figure 1 A-C, Supp Table 1 A-C).
Results regarding internalizing problems depended on the cohort, though gender effect
sizes were smaller than externalizing problems and prosocial behaviors (Figure 1 A-C, Supp Table 1
A-C). In FT12, girls had slightly higher levels of internalizing problems compared to boys (Cohen’s d
range: -0.09–(-)0.23). In GENR and NTR, for all internalizing problems, boys and girls generally had

similar levels (Cohen’s d range: -0.04–0.12 in GENR and -0.09–0.10 in NTR). In TEDS, levels of
anxiety problems between boys and girls were also generally similar (Cohen’s d range: -0.08–0.03).
Additionally, for all cohorts, mean differences between boys and girls were found in all
social behaviors, with boys having slightly more social/peer problems (Cohen’s d range: 0.10–0.24)
and girls having higher prosocial scores (Cohen’s d range: -0.37–(-)0.63).

Co-occurrence of aggression and other problems
Overall, the strength of the correlations of aggressive behavior with other externalizing
problems ranged 0.47–0.80, for aggressive behavior and internalizing problems 0.02–0.39, and for
aggressive behavior and prosocial behavior 0.33–0.54 (note: some internalizing problems and all
prosocial behavior correlation values with aggressive behavior were negative)(Figure 2 A-C, Supp
Table 2). In general, correlation patterns of aggressive behavior with other co-occurring behaviors
were similar across cohorts and ages and between genders.
In FT12, correlations of aggressive behavior and other externalizing problems (i.e.,
hyperactivity–impulsivity and inattention) ranged from 0.51–0.75 for boys and 0.48-0.70 for girls
(Figure 2 A-C, Supp Table 2). For aggressive behavior and depression, correlations ranged 0.16–
0.29, while aggressive behavior and social anxiety correlations were negative, ranging from -0.10
to -0.02. Correlations of aggressive and prosocial behavior ranged from -0.33 to -0.54. Finally,
although the relationships between aggression and co-occurring behaviors are the main focus of
this study, other noteworthy correlations were hyperactivity–impulsivity with inattention (r range:
0.61–0.74), depression with social anxiety (r range: 0.53–0.62), and prosocial with inattention (r
range: -0.44 to -0.61).
In GENR, correlations of aggressive behavior and other externalizing problems (i.e., rulebreaking behavior and attention problems) ranged 0.69–0.80 (Figure 2 A-C, Supp Table 2). For

correlations of aggressive and internalizing problems (i.e., anxious/depressed, somatic complaints,
and withdrawn/depressed), correlations ranged 0.14–0.39, with aggressive behavior and
anxious/depressed correlations being highest and aggressive behavior and somatic complaints
correlations being lowest. Other noteworthy patterns were that correlations of rule-breaking
behavior and internalizing problems were 1.3–1.7-fold higher in boys than girls, and that
correlations of social problems with all other subscales were nearly identical for boys and girls.
In NTR, correlations of aggressive behavior and other externalizing problems (i.e., rulebreaking behavior and attention problems) ranged from 0.69–0.78 for boys and 0.62–0.67 for girls
(Figure 2 A-C, Supp Table 2). For correlations of aggressive behavior and internalizing problems
(i.e., anxious/depressed, somatic complaints, and withdrawn/depressed), correlations ranged
0.26–0.38 for aggressive behavior with anxious/depressed and 0.15–0.19 for aggressive behavior
with withdrawn/depressed and somatic complaints. Other noteworthy patterns were that
correlations of social problems with all other subscales were very similar for boys and girls (as with
GENR).
In TEDS, correlations of aggressive behavior and other externalizing problems (i.e.,
hyperactivity) ranged from 0.51–0.58 for boys and 0.47-0.50 for girls (Figure 2 A-C, Supp Table 2).
For aggressive behavior and anxiety, correlations ranged 0.10–0.21, while aggressive behavior and
peer problems correlations ranged 0.26–0.42. Correlations of aggressive and prosocial behaviors
were negative and ranged -0.43–(-)0.50. Finally, other noteworthy patterns were that while
correlations of hyperactivity with anxiety remained similar over the ages (r range: 0.19–0.23),
correlations of peer problems with both of them change at age 12, after having been similar for
ages 7 and 9 (r range for boys and girls ages 7 and 9: 0.30–0.37 for both correlations; r values age
12 for peer problems with hyperactivity: 0.49 for boys, 0.45 for girls; r values age 12 for peer
problems with anxiety: 0.19 for boys, 0.21 for girls).

Linear Regression Models
In initial modeling (i.e., aggressive behavior as the dependent variable and one subscale as
the independent variable), gender was significantly associated with aggression. Additionally, all
GENR and NTR models indicated significant gender interaction terms, and in the TEDS cohort all
but the age-12 anxiety model resulted in a significant gender interaction (Table 1 A-C). In contrast,
for FT12, the age-12 and age-14 internalizing models and age-14 externalizing model did not
indicate significant gender interaction. Regarding model R2 values (% of variance in dependent
variable explained by independent variables), externalizing models were consistently largest (boy
range: 0.26–0.63; girl range: 0.22–0.54). For internalizing models, R2 values were small (boy range:
0.03–0.15; girl range: 0.01–0.11). For prosocial models in FT12, the R2 values ranged 0.11–0.29 and
were 1.9–4.4-fold smaller than externalizing R2 values, while in TEDS, the R2 values ranged 0.18–
0.25 and were only 1.1–1.5-fold smaller than externalizing R2 values.
In the multiple regression modeling (i.e., multiple subscales included simultaneously as
independent variables), the R2 values did not generally differ from values for externalizing only
models (Table 2 A-C). However, the independent variables in these analyses were generally
significant. All betas (effect sizes) were generally smaller in these models compared to models
with only one independent variable at a time, with betas for externalizing behaviors being the
largest of the independent variables. Gender interactions were also generally significant in these
models (exceptions being most FT12 independent variables and anxiety for TEDS age 9 and 12
models, and prosocial for the TEDS age 12 model).

This study provides a reference panel of average levels and co-occurence of aggressive
behavior and other behaviors for given ages in the European school setting. Results indicate that
patterns are quite similar across the different cohorts of Finland, the Netherlands, and the UK. We
show that, as expected, the levels of aggressive behavior are statistically significantly different by
gender, however, the effect sizes are only moderate. Generally, regarding levels of all behaviors,
externalizing problems were higher among boys, internalizing problems were similar between the
genders, and prosocial behavior was higher among girls; all effect sizes ranged from small to
moderate. Furthermore, we see that aggression often co-occurs with other behavioral and
emotional difficulties, and correlations of aggressive behavior and other co-occurring behaviors
are, in practice, quite similar between the genders. Regression modeling indicated that much of
the variation (R2) in aggressive behavior levels was explained by other co-occurring externalizing
problems, though prosocial models also had rather large R2 values in initial individual models.
Modeling multiple co-occurring behaviors simultaneously did not generally improve the explained
variance but all modeled co-occurring behaviors, generally, remained significant in these models
(but with smaller effect sizes). Thus, it seems that children with aggressive behavior often have not
only one co-occurring problem behavior, but possibly multiple co-occurring problems (including
low prosocial skills).
There was a very strong co-occurence of aggressive behavior with other externalizing
problems. What is remarkable are the similarities in the gender patterns of aggressive behavior
and other externalizing problems. Although boys did exhibit the expected statisically significantly
higher levels and associations of aggression and other externalizing problems compared to girls,
the mean level effect sizes were only moderate and correlations between aggression and cooccurring externalizing behaviors were very similar, the difference in size was never more than 0.1
between boys and girls. In this respect, it is important to point to another study on the NTR cohort

regarding gender differences in ADHD diagnosis and comorbidity using teacher ratings (Derks,
2007) in which boys and girls had similar comorbidity profiles and school impairment. However,
girls were less likely than boys to be identified by teachers as disruptive and referred for
treatment. Similarly, conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder have both been much
more likely to be attributed to boys than girls among teacher ratings, compared to parent ratings
(Offord et al. 1996, Maughan et al. 2004). While keeping situational aggressive behavior and
discrepancies between raters in mind (Achenbach et al. 1987, Verhulst et al. 1994, De Los Reyes et
al. 2005), we also need to consider that girls may not be as readily identified as being aggressive
by teachers as boys, although their patterns of comorbid problems and need for treatment may be
similar.
While the relationships between aggressive behavior and co-occurring externalizing
problems are well-established, the co-occurrence with internalizing problems are less well
described. Generally, there is moderate correlation between aggressive and depressive symptoms
(Van den Oord 2000), but the relationship with anxiety is less well described. The behavioral
questionnaires used here cannot fully clarify because internalizing problems were characterized
and measured in various ways. The MPNI (used by FT12) indicated that depressiveness was
moderately correlated with aggressive behavior, while social anxiety was not correlated with
aggressive behavior. The TRF (used by GENR and NTR) showed higher correlations between
anxious–depressed and aggressive behavior than between withdrawn–depressed or somatic
problems, while the SDQ (used by TEDS) anxiety measure showed low correlation with aggressive
behavior. These mixed results regarding aggressive behavior and internalizing problems could
partially be explained by August et al. (1996) who found that, among schoolchildren,
anxiety/mood disorders most often co-occur with multiple externalizing disorders (instead of, for
example, only conduct disorder [a severe aggression problem]). However, these correlations do

indicate a relationship with aggressive behavior, and patterns were similar across genders, thus,
future studies should clarify the nuances of these relationships which are perhaps less often
considered in the school setting than the more overt and administratively problematic
externalizing behaviors.
Prosocial behavior has been shown to be negatively associated with aggressive behavior
(Eron and Huesmann, 1984), which was seen in this study as well. Correlations of prosocial
behavior with aggressive behavior were moderate in strength. In regression models, prosocial
behavior alone explained much of the variance in aggressive behavior, but the effect of prosocial
behavior attenuated substantially (though remained significant) when adding externalizing
behavior as an additional independent variable of aggressive behavior. The relationships appear
complex, students exhibiting aggressive behavior are often struggling not only with other
externalizing problem behaviors but also a lack of social skills. On the other hand, Kokko et al.
(2000) has shown that prosocial behavior is protective in aggressive children against future
unemployment. Additionally, Hämäläinen and Pulkkinen (1996) have shown that aggressiveness
without other co-occurring problems did not predict future criminality, although low prosocial
behavior alone did. Furthermore, although we found statistically significant gender differences, we
saw that prosocial–aggressive behavior correlations were still less than 0.15 different between
boys and girls, and the differences between genders in TEDS correlation values were half the size
of those in FT12. This may be related to the severity of the aggression measure, since the SDQ
(used in TEDS) captures conduct problems which are more serious than the general aggression
captured by the MPNI (used in FT12), thus suggesting that, especially when comparing the highest
levels of aggression with levels of prosocial behavior, there are no gender differences.
In our study protocol, each age from each cohort represent a cross-sectional snapshot of
behavioral and emotional problems, with some children allowed to be captured in more than one

age category. Because all data are drawn in large numbers and in a population-based manner,
these data do reflect developmental stages well. Over the ages presented here, we can see that
age patterns do not generally differ by gender. For all cohorts, the differences in aggressive–cooccurring behavior correlations between all ages were less than 0.11. In longitudinal settings, the
general trend is that population levels of aggressive behavior diminish as age increases, although
there tends to be stability in rank order across certain individuals (those with high aggression and
those of lower socioeconomic status) (Odgers et al. 2008, Moffitt 1993; Pulkkinen 2017; Tremblay
et al., 2004).
Considering further comparison between cohorts, we have to be careful to indicate that
we are actually comparing behavioral questionnaires as well. We see similar patterns in the similar
subscales across cohorts/questionnaires, which is noteworthy since the cohorts represent
different European countries and the questionnaires were developed for different purposes. The
MPNI was developed mainly to characterize behavior and emotion regulation, the SDQ was
developed as a behavioral screening tool, while the TRF can be used for both psychopathology
screening and diagnostic capabilities. Furthermore, both the ASEBA system (of which the TRF is a
part) and the SDQ were assessed in Achenbach et al. (2008) and generally found to be comparable
across countries, with more variation found within populations than between.
Broadening our considerations and comparisons further, although direct assessment of
differences in country or school systems would be inappropriate in this context, we briefly present
some items to consider in the Supplemental Material (see Supplemental Text for further details on
school systems and teacher rating collections in Finland, the Netherlands, and the UK). Regarding
country differences, Hendricks et al. (in press) found less adolescent aggressive behaviors in
countries with more policies for child and adolescent mental health (Finland had more policies and
less violence compared to the UK and the Netherlands). In considering the 2015 PISA for a general

sense of exposure to bullying/violence in schools in the different countries, we see: 14.2% of
schoolchildren in the UK, 9.5% in Finland, and 3.3% in the Netherlands are ‘frequently’ exposed to
bullying (OECD average: 8.9%) (OECD, 2017). It is possible these differing bullying frequencies
affect a teacher’s perception of problem behaviors and the prevalence of aggressive behavior
among the children themselves. However, although these differences in exposure to bullying exist
across countries, the patterns of aggressive behavior and most co-occuring behaviors remain
notably similar.
One additional comparison of the patterns seen here can be made to a parallel analysis
among the same ACTION cohorts, using parental ratings (Bartels et al. 2018; interactive results
also available at http://www.action-euproject.eu/ComorbidityChildAggression). Overall,
comparing parental ratings at similar ages, teacher-based correlations of aggressive behavior with
co-occuring behaviors are generally higher for externalizing problems and lower for internalizing
problems and prosocial behaviors. In line with these differences, the meta-analysis of Achenbach
et al. (1987) on cross-informant agreement showed only moderate agreement between teacher
ratings and parent assessments (0.27). Explanations include actual situational differences in
behaviors and that parents have fewer opportunities for making observations of many similaraged children. These rater differences are also being further explored in forthcoming ACTION
publications pertaining to (epi)genetic-wide association analyses.
These results can be further utilized in aggression interventions, both school-based and
ones supporting the child in all environments. School-based aggression interventions which can
organize learning and hobbies at school in a way that enforces social skills and which can identify
children at special risk (high levels of aggression with comorbid problems) and guide their parents
to seek help from specialists are of particular importance. One such intervention with positive
results was performed by Greenberg et al. (2010). Their “multi-year universal social–emotional

learning program” was implemented and showed reduced levels of aggression and increased
prosocial skills (results were most notable among children with higher baseline levels of
aggression).
Despite the nearly 40,000 teacher-rated observations of behavioral and emotional
problems among school children ages 7–14 collected across three European countries, there are
limitations to consider in this study. Regarding the generalizability of these results, these data
come from three higher income countries of Europe, but it is unclear if these patterns would
remain in lower income countries or countries of differing cultural backgrounds. For example, a
recent publication utilizing data from 63 low- and middle-income countries collected by the World
Health Organization’s Global School-based Student Health Survey indicates that gender
differences in physical aggression are stronger as a function of greater gender equality in a society
(Nivette, 2018).
Lastly, three of the four cohorts consist of twins. While twins are born on average
prematurely and of lower birthweight, they are generally indistinguishable from singletons later in
life on average on multiple traits and conditions. More specifically, Pulkkinen et al. (2003)
compared the FT12 twins included in the present study with their 23,200 classmates, and showed
that the twins are very representative of Finnish schoolchildren at ages 11–12 with respect to both
internalizing and externalizing behaviors on the MPNI. In the current analysis, we had assessments
of 7-year-old twins (NTR) and singletons (GENR) from the Netherlands using the same assessment
instrument and found the correlations of aggression with other scales was very similar in twins
and singletons. De Zeeuw et al. (2012) looked at differences between twins included in the current
project and their nontwin siblings in educational achievement and found that any differences
could largely be explained by birth order within the family.

We have presented a reference set of teacher-rated childhood aggressive behavior levels
and associations with co-occurring behaviors in the school setting. These results indicate that
aggressive behavior regularly co-occurs with other externalizing behaviors and a lack of prosocial
skills, and moderately co-occurs with internalizing problems. Furthermore, although differences
exist regarding levels of aggressive behavior between boys and girls, we draw attention to the
relative similarities in patterns of associations between aggressive behavior and co-occurring
behaviors across genders. Teachers are a valuable resource for identifying children in need of
specific support. However, teacher trainings could help to reduce potential gender prejudice
regarding problem behaviors, instead focusing on all children, and to recognize that those with
one problem behavior likely have multiple problem behaviors they are struggling with.
Additionally, school interventions for aggression need to be holistic, focusing on broad behavioral
and emotional improvement.

Both ‘Attention Problems’ and ‘Rule-Breaking’ are modeled due to ‘Attention Problems’ being more comparable to the other cohorts’ modeled
externalizing behavior measure, although ‘Rule-Breaking’ was the externalizing behavior most highly correlated with aggression (a specified ‘rule’ in the
methods for inclusion in linear regression)
