ABSTRACT

30

background

31

Despite active case-finding (ACF) identifying more presumptive and confirmed TB cases, high

32

pre-diagnostic loss to follow-up (PDLFU) among presumptive TB cases referred for diagnostic

33

test remains a concern. We aimed to quantify the PDLFU, and identify the barriers and enablers

34

in undergoing a diagnostic evaluation in an ACF program implemented in 1.02 million rural

35

population in the Samastipur district of Bihar, India.

36

methods

37

During their routine work, Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA, a community health worker

38

or CHW), informal providers, and community laypersons identified people at risk of TB, and

39

referred them to the program. A field coordinator (FC) screened them for TB symptoms at the

40

patient’s home. The identified presumptive TB cases were accompanied by the CHW to a

41

designated government facility for diagnostics. Those with a confirmed TB diagnosis were put

42

on treatment by the CHW and followed-up till treatment completion. All services were provided

43

free of cost and patients were supported throughout the care pathway, including a transport

44

allowance. We analyzed programmatically collected data, conducted in-depth interviews with

45

patients, and focus group discussions with the CHWs and FCs in an explanatory mixed-methods

46

design.

47

results

48

A total of 11146 presumptive TB cases were identified from January 2018 to December 2018,

49

out of which 4912 (44.1%) underwent a diagnostic evaluation. The key enablers were CHW

50

accompaniment and support in addition to the free TB services in the public sector. The major

51

barriers identified were transport challenges, deficient family and health provider support, and

52

poor services in the public system.

53

conclusion

54

If we are to find missing cases, the health system needs urgent reform, and diagnostic services

55

need to be patient-centric. A strong patient support system engaging all stakeholders and

56

involvement of CHWs in routine TB care is an effective solution.

INTRODUCTION

66

The End TB strategy targets an 80% reduction in TB incidence by 2030.[1] However, as many as

67

4.1 million (39%) patients globally are not notified, indicating a mix of under-reporting and

68

under-diagnosis.[2] Of these, India alone has about a million.[3,4] Analysis of the cascade of

69

care can effectively quantify the gaps in successive steps of TB care pathway and informs the TB

70

programs of potential interventions.[4] The Indian public sector cascade and the South African

71

cascade estimate a loss to follow up (LFU) at test access of 28% and 5% respectively out of

72

incident cases.[5,6] Similar approaches can be used to evaluate case-finding programs involving

73

systematic TB screening.[5]

74

Historically, most TB patients were identified through passive case-finding in which patients

75

self-referred to a provider for a diagnostic evaluation.[7] It may lead to delays in diagnosis and

76

continued transmission in the community.[8] The known major challenges in diagnosis are poor

77

geographical and financial access to healthcare, fewer symptoms delay seeking healthcare, and

78

failure to test when people do present at the facility.[9]

79

Diverse active case finding (ACF) strategies have demonstrated increased TB case detection

80

with

81

PDLFU. A study from India reported only 22% of the people with presumptive TB reaching a

82

microscopy center, while an ACF program in Myanmar reported only 51.4% of patients with

83

abnormal chest X-ray (CXR) getting their sputum examined.[12,13] A recent study of a TB

84

program in a district of Zimbabwe reported a PDLFU of 25% with patient's residence, HIV status

85

and type of health facility emerging as significant risk factors.[14] Although these studies rely

86

on routinely collected programmatic data, there has been no study exploring the reasons for

87

the high PDLFU and the perspectives of associated stakeholders.

88

We aimed to identify the PDLFU, and assess the enablers and barriers for diagnostic evaluation

89

in a community-based ACF program during 2018 in Bihar, India. The specific objectives were: 1)

90

to assess proportion of people screened among community referrals, 2) to assess number of

94

METHODS

95

study design

96

We used an explanatory mixed-methods study design, where the quantitative phase (cohort

97

analysis) was followed by a qualitative phase (descriptive design).[15]

98

study setting

99

General setting

100

The study was conducted in the Sarairanjan, Bibhutipur, and Ujiarpur blocks (equivalent to TB

101

Unit or TU) of Samastipur district in Bihar with a combined population of 1,021,483. Located in

102

the Indo-Gangetic plain, agriculture was the main occupation of the population. The highest

103

earning member in 69.8% of the households earned less than INR 60,000 annually (~USD 852)

104

and 63.5% of the population was reported literate.[16] Females had 20% lesser literacy rate

105

compared to males, and infant mortality rate (IMR) was 60 for females against that of 48 for

106

males.[17] The public TB case notification rate in the district was 55 per 100,000 population

107

(2017) and the pre-treatment LFU was 25% (2017).[18]

108

The population was serviced by 12 primary health centres (PHC) under the Public Health System

109

(PHS).[19] Within the Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP), 4 designated microscopy

110

centres (DMC) run by laboratory technicians provided sputum microscopy. A Senior Treatment

111

Supervisor (STS) at the TU level managed the program and a Senior Treatment Laboratory

112

Supervisor (STLS) oversaw a group of DMCs.

113

The last-mile TB care services were provided by a Community Health Worker (called ASHA or

114

Accredited Social Health Activist). Initiated under the National Health Mission (NHM) in 2005,

115

an ASHA is a literate woman of the village and assigned for every 1000 population. Her key

116

responsibility is to be a facilitator, mobilizer, and community service provider for various public

117

health programs.[20] Under the RNTCP, ASHA received activity-based remuneration: INR 1000

collaboration with the RNTCP in the above population. The key aspects were: 1) community

126

referral of people at risk of TB, 2) symptom-based screening at patient’s doorstep, 3) ASHA-

127

accompanied diagnostic evaluation, 4) training to ASHA, 5) extensive stakeholder engagement,

128

and 6) engaging multiple community members, including AWW and informal providers (also

129

known as RMP or Registered Medical Practitioner).

130

After an initial dialogue, ASHA, AWW, RMPs and the community were asked to refer people

131

who may have TB. They relied on their existing knowledge of the community and looked for

132

people at risk of TB during their routine work and social activities. These community referrals

133

were reported to a field coordinator (FC) of the project, who screened them at their home for

134

TB symptoms systematically. All presumptive TB cases were referred for a sputum microscopy

135

and chest x-ray (CXR). All people with a positive smear, or people with a negative smear but

136

abnormal CXR, or people with a negative smear but clinically suspect were offered a GeneXpert

137

test using sputum collection and transport. ASHAs assisted presumptive TB patients in reaching

138

the

139

transport allowance and diagnostic tests were free of cost. If the PHS physician confirmed TB

140

diagnosis, treatment was initiated under ASHA’s supervision. The ASHA delivered drugs to the

141

patient, and supported them till treatment completion.[Figure 1]

142

A conditional incentive of INR 200 (~USD 3) for community referral and INR 300 (~ USD 5) for

143

each confirmed diagnosis of TB was given by the project. These incentives to the ASHA were in

144

addition to the RNTCP treatment support incentives. The project’s FCs received a fixed monthly

salary.

The project used a Management Information System (MIS) developed in Microsoft Excel which

147

maintained individual patient data electronically. On receipt of a community referral, the FC

148

enlisted them in a referral register with a unique ID and a separate form was completed for

235

lesser among those who were referred by an RMP (43.9%) and complained of hemoptysis in the

236

last 6 months (36.7%). On multivariate analysis, presumptive TB cases who were between 15 to

237

44 years of age (aRR 0.9, 95% CI: 0.9 – 1.0, p = 0) were more likely to be LFU in the pre-

238

diagnostic stage. All of the clinical features of presumptive TB were also associated with lower

239

LFU except lymph node swelling. Alcohol use was an independent risk factor for LFU (aRR 1.2,

240

95% CI: 1.1 – 1.4, p = 0.01). The median time to diagnosis was 1 day (IQR = 3). (Table 2)

241

Enablers to access the first diagnostic evaluation

242

In the interviews, patients reported the following enablers in getting a diagnostic evaluation:

243

transport allowance for travel to the hospital, free services in the PHS and knowledge of the

244

PHS procedures, accompaniment of ASHA and her assistance in the diagnostic process, and

245

ASHA’s understanding of the PHS functioning. (Figure 3)

246

“I started facing financial problems after going to the private hospital… Had I known the quality

247

of care in the government hospital earlier, I would have come here. It helped that I didn’t have

248

to spend any money. I went by a vehicle to the PHC and consulted the doctor for free of cost.”

249

(23 years old male patient)

250

“I didn’t have to go to the hospital after submitting the sample for diagnostics… ASHA took me

251

to the hospital and now sends the medicine… I was bony and couldn’t even move a step earlier…

252

I became better only from these government drugs; rest were useless. Between RMP and private

253

clinic, we spent nearly )20,000 (~ USD 292).” (17 years old female TB patient on medication)

254

“When I had chest pain, ASHA told me that we’ll have to go to the PHC, tests will be free, and I’ll

255

get return fare from my home. I thought I’ll get better and decided to go. I got a blood test and

256

x-ray done. Reports were normal and I got some medicines. I felt better… If you know the

257

hospital and workers there, it is easier to get things done. Else, you have to spend a lot of time.”

258

(30 years old female patient)

259

The ASHAs and the Field Coordinators (FCs) expressed transport allowance, incentive to ASHA,

260

positive patient experience, and patient accompaniment as enablers. (Figure 3)

261

“If one patient becomes better, she also advises others. Even if we don’t know, the patient who

262

becomes better asks their ill neighbor to call the ASHA for everything. Our mobile number is

263

available in every household.” (ASHA)

264

“Sometimes, patients do not have any shared conveyance from their home. In such cases,

265

patients are unable to come, and transport allowance or hiring an autorickshaw for, say 10

266

patients of the village, really helps. That way, they get consultation and lab tests at PHC, then

267

chest x-ray at another diagnostic facility, and get dropped at their home.” (Field coordinator)

activities.” (Field coordinator)

Category 1: Logistics-related

274

As per patients, public transport

275

mentioned their inability to pay for it even where it was available. They also reported not

knowing the location of the diagnostic center.

277

“I don’t know where the diagnostic center is. From my village, I have to walk for 3 – 4 km before

278

I find any transport.” (65 years old woman)

279

The

280

population like disabled people was a key logistics-related challenge.

281

“Travel options are also limited for some areas. Either it is not readily available or you have to

282

walk before anything can be found. They don’t have the money to reserve an entire shared

284

Category 2: Health system-related

285

According to patients, the care at PHC was slow and took a lot of time. They said either the PHC

286

remained closed or they didn’t reach the PHC in working hours. At other times when they

287

reached, the providers were not available at the facility.

288

“I had to go 2-3 times to the PHC before all the tests were completed and reports arrived. Only

289

then I could get the medicines.” (17 years old female patient)

290

“We have to run-around a lot in the government hospital. There are huge buildings and it is

291

difficult to figure out what happens where alone.” (30 years old male patient)

292

The health workers reported unavailability of some diagnostic services in the PHC and the high

293

cost of getting these in the private sector. ASHA’s remuneration for providing TB care services

294

was irregular and unpaid. They indicated that poor patient experience at the PHC also deterred

295

others and that the public put a stronger faith in the private sector.

296

“Patient doesn’t know where the registration desk is, where the doctor sits, where the labs and

297

x-ray are done. We have to go with them to get everything completed quickly.” (ASHA)

298

“I have provided treatment to 20 patients, but I haven’t been paid for it. It is only in the recent 1-

299

2 years that there has been some improvement. We are not told properly how to fill the

300

document and what to submit for release of payments. All our papers were taken and nothing

301

happened. Earlier we used to only counsel the patient to go for diagnostics, but now we come

302

with them if we get money for helping in diagnosis.” (ASHA)

303

“If patient come on a given day and their work doesn’t get done, they won’t come again.

304

Coming again will mean foregoing another day’s wage. They will say that ASHA cheated them

305

and nothing happened at the hospital and nothing is available at the PHC ever. If they go to a

306

private clinic, everything is done in one day and they get the medicine… They also prefer

307

private.” (ASHA)

308

Category 3: Health provider-related

309

Patients described health worker strikes in the field and at the PHC as a barrier. One patient

310

also reported that ASHA doesn’t come to their home.

311

“I took the sputum to the PHC, but nothing was done. PHC was on strike for 15 days. The

312

unabated cough and fever didn’t let me sleep. When I felt that I would die, I took an injection

313

from the RMP and drank 5 cough syrups. Only then was there any relief.”

315

“What will happen after going to the PHC‽ I go to the hospital and come back with nothing.

316

Even ASHA doesn’t come. I am going to lose everything in this hustle and bustle.”

317

female patient)

318

The health workers reported RMPs misguiding the patients, low morale of the workers, and

319

poor health provider behavior at the PHC as barriers.

320

“RMPs misguide the patients a lot. They give medications and injections without any concern.

321

They are not at risk even if the patient dies. If patient becomes serious and they have made

322

money, they will refer them to hospital. They roam through the villages and people get medicine

323

at their doorstep. Someone who is a laborer, their income for the day is saved.” (ASHA)

324

“When we take the patient to the PHC, lab technician will return the sample and asks to come

325

on another day... Doctor will also not write any medication and don’t know the updated

326

guidelines… We have to then listen from our patient.” (ASHA)

327

Category 4: Family-related

328

Patients indicated not knowing the extent of available services in the PHS. Some described

329

severe indebtedness of the family and not having any money for healthcare. According to them,

330

insufficient family support and absence of a caretaker in the family were also barriers.

331

“I live with my two granddaughters and my son works as a watchman in New Delhi. The money

332

is irregular. If I’ve no money, I won’t go. In November, I didn’t have money and couldn’t go… For

333

consulting with the RMP, I had to take a loan of )150

334

to return only )50.” (65 years old female patient)

335

“Both my kids are alone. My husband has migrated for work. He says that take the kids to a

336

senior doctor in a private hospital. It’ll cost at least )3000

337

There is only my old mother-in-law in the house besides me. How will I leave them alone at

338

home?” (Mother of a 6 years old patient)

339

Health workers mentioned permission from the head of the family to visit facility, restricted

340

mobility of women in the families as compared to men, and family’s concern only if symptoms

341

were severe as barriers.

342

“Patients say that we’ll ask the head of the family and come only if they assent. Sometimes they

343

are not sure of the quality of care in the PHS. We also counsel the guardian… This happens more

344

often for women. Men are independent; they don’t have to ask the head or the wife… It is also

345

difficult for women. They have to complete household chores and care for the kids before

346

leaving home for the facility. Often, by the time they reach, the facility will close.” (ASHA)

347

“If the symptoms are not severe, then patient takes some medicine from RMP at their home and

348

doesn’t want to come for a test.” (Field coordinator)

349

Category 5: Patient-related

350

Patients indicated denial of suffering from TB.

351

“I don’t need any diagnostics. I didn’t have TB ever in my family. This is all because of gas.”

352

years old patient)

353

As per health workers, some patients had a fear of TB. They also reported discrimination by the

354

community against TB patients.

355

“We don’t say TB at first. If we say it, people hesitate. Some are offended that we have said TB

356

is a possible disease for them. We’ve to tell them gently. One sputum positive patient said that

357

she was hurt that I said she has TB.” (ASHA)

358

“A lot of people prefer to keep their disease status hidden. TB is considered contagious and

359

people don’t want neighbors to know of it. Earlier, even patient’s utensils and bedding were

360

kept separate.” (ASHA)

361

DISCUSSION

362

This is the first study to assess the magnitude of the pre-diagnostic LFU in an ACF program

363

along with the barriers and enablers in undergoing a diagnostic evaluation. In our study, nearly

364

44% of the presumptive TB cases didn’t undergo diagnostic evaluation. Provision of transport

365

allowance

366

incentives to ASHA, and word-of-mouth recommendation of satisfied patients emerged as key

367

enablers. The major barriers were challenges in transport despite an allowance, insufficient

368

family and health provider support, inadequate health services, and poor faith in the public

369

sector.

370

There

371

quantitative

372

component explored hitherto unresearched reasons for the pre-diagnostic LFU and recorded

373

the perspectives of various stakeholders in the diagnostic process, including patients and CHWs.

374

Second, the study was conducted in an ACF program using routinely collected data and reflects

375

the

376

Reporting of OBservational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guidelines for the quantitative

377

part and the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research (COREQ) guidelines for

378

qualitative part.[25,26]

379

There are several limitations as well. First, the study was conducted in a designed ACF program

380

with interventions across the TB care cascade. The site was different than a typical RNTCP

381

implementation and multiple program staff worked on it in addition to the CHWs and RNTCP

382

staff. In addition, the PHS was comparatively weaker in the study region. Second, there was

383

intuitive screening taking place before the patients entered the care cascade. Therefore, the

384

true number of people being screened was not known. Third, we only recorded presumptive TB

385

cases undergoing diagnostic evaluation and there was no recording of presumptive TB cases

386

reaching facility but not undergoing evaluation. Fourth, the yield in terms of confirmed TB

387

diagnosis was known, but we didn’t record the number of people completing the diagnostic

388

process as per the diagnostic algorithm. Fifth, we missed presumptive TB cases accessing TB

389

390

The study from the ACF program in Myanmar reported 96.6% of the presumptive TB cases

391

receiving CXR in the mobile van, while only 51.4% of the cases referred for sputum microscopy

392

to the health facility followed through. Immediate availability of a mobile CXR machine was a

393

key factor behind such high rates, and lack of a one-stop diagnostic service was a disincentive

394

for patients.[12] Project Axshya in India reported a low 22% people going to the DMC out of all

395

those referred, while overall 54% received sputum microscopy through sputum transport and

396

referral to DMC combined.[13] In contrast, 41.1% of the presumptive TB cases in our study

397

went to a facility for a diagnostic evaluation. Our qualitative findings corroborate it and suggest

398

that difficulty in transport and poor patient experience are important barriers. A one-stop care

399

center increases the service uptake and patients don’t have to make repeated visits. Similarly,

400

sputum transport mechanisms reduce patient’s hardship. Accompaniment and support of ASHA

401

is a likely reason for this difference with the previous Indian finding.

402

The

403

important risk factor for pre-diagnostic LFU.[14] While we found association of LFU with various

404

risk factors, their importance in public health programs is limited. However, the qualitative

405

findings point towards important reasons. Previously known challenges in TB programs like TB

406

stigma, patient denial, poor patient experience, and health system deficiencies resonated in our

407

findings. Patients found care seeking in public sector cumbersome, and the informal providers

408

and private sector remained a trusted first choice for most. While there were no significant

409

differences in LFU between the genders, women reported additional challenges of restricted

410

mobility, financial dependence, and burden of household work.

411

The

412

services, particularly in poor and rural populations. In fact, the barriers in accessing a diagnostic

413

evaluation have a bearing on the access to a broader range of primary healthcare services in

414

similar settings. Learnings from enablers and addressing barriers can improve uptake of the

418

system challenges involving the perspectives of health system administrators, doctors, nurses,

419

and other health facility workers will inform the process of such a reform.

420

In conclusion, about three-fifths of the presumptive TB cases were LFU in pre-diagnostic stage

421

and didn’t have a TB diagnostic test. Several enablers and barriers for diagnostic evaluation

422

were identified. If we want to find the missing TB patients, it needs to be easier for presumptive

423

TB patients to navigate the diagnostic process. Health system reforms are rather complex,

424

however, rather simple interventions such as sputum transportation and adequate support

425

from a person knowing the health system may already make big changes.
