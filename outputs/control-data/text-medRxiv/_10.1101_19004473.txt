Abstract

25

Background: Microbiological diagnosis of prosthetic joint infection (PJI) relies on culture techniques

26

that are slow and insensitive. Rapid tests are urgently required to improve patient management.

27

Calprotectin is a neutrophil biomarker of inflammation that has been demonstrated to be effective for

28

the diagnosis of PJI. A calprotectin based lateral flow test has been developed for the rapid detection

29

of PJI using synovial fluid samples.

30

Methods: A convenience series of 69 synovial fluid samples from patients at the Norfolk and Norwich

31

University Hospitals (NNUH) were collected intraoperatively from 52 hip and 17 knee revision

32

operations. Calprotectin levels were measured using a new commercially available lateral flow assay

33

for PJI diagnosis (Lyfstone). For all samples, synovial fluid was pipetted onto the lateral flow device

34

and the signal was read using a mobile phone app after 15 minutes incubation at room temperature.

35

Results: According to the Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) criteria, 24 patients were defined

36

as PJI positive and the remaining 45 were negative. The overall accuracy of the lateral flow test

37

against the MSIS criteria was 75%. The test had a sensitivity and specificity of 75% and 76%

38

respectively with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 62% and a negative predictive value (NPV) of

39

85%. Discordant results were then reviewed by the clinical team using available patient data to

40

develop an alternative gold standard for defining presence/absence of infection (MSIS+). Compared

41

to MSIS+, the test showed an overall accuracy of 83%, sensitivity and specificity of 95% and 78%

42

respectively, a PPV of 62% and an NPV of 98%. Test accuracy for hip revisions was 77% and for

43

knee revisions was 100%.

44

Conclusions: This study demonstrates that the calprotectin lateral flow assay is an effective diagnostic

45

test for PJI. Our data suggests that the test is likely to generate false positive results in patients with

46

metallosis and gross osteolysis.

Each year in the UK, approximately 160,000 primary hip and knee replacements are performed plus

50

an additional 14,000 revision operations. Prosthetic Joint Infection (PJI) is responsible for 14% of

51

these revisions [1].

52

Diagnosis of PJI remains a challenge and guidelines vary between countries. Low-grade PJIs are

53

particularly difficult to diagnose. They are commonly caused by bacteria which do not have a clear

54

pathogenic role and often contaminate tissue samples, making culture results difficult to interpret [2].

55

These organisms are also less likely to trigger an increase in inflammatory makers [3]. The inability to

56

differentiate between low-grade infections and aseptic loosening, leads to patients undergoing

57

numerous investigations and unnecessary two-stage revisions. This treatment option comes with a

58

higher cost both to the to the healthcare system and accompanying patient morbidity, along with an

59

associated higher complication rate than one-stage revisions [4]. For this group of patients especially

60

there is a need for a diagnostic test that can reliably exclude PJI.

61

The Musculoskeletal Infection Society (MSIS) published a list of criteria designed to standardise the

62

diagnosis of PJI [5]. The criteria require a diagnostic work-up combining preoperative and

63

intraoperative findings with selected inflammatory markers and culture results. MSIS criteria are

64

useful but fallible, due to the heavy weighting placed on microbiological culture results, which are

65

known to have sub-optimal specificity and sensitivity.

66

In 2018, the MSIS criteria were revised due to the emergence of new PJI biomarkers including serum

67

D-dimer, synovial alpha-defensins and synovial leukocyte esterase [6]. These tests can be expensive

68

and their application in clinical practice is currently limited. An alternative biomarker is synovial fluid

69

calprotectin. Calprotectin is a protein complex released during inflammation that makes up 60% of all

70

soluble proteins in neutrophils [7]. Neutrophils are recruited to sites of inflammation and infection

71

response; therefore, high amounts of neutrophils biomarkers are expected to be seen in infected

72

patient samples [8].

73

Calprotectin is routinely used to screen for inflammatory bowel disease and has been shown to detect

74

relapses in rheumatoid arthritis [9, 10]. In a recent study, a stool calprotectin test was used off label

75

for PJI diagnosis demonstrating a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.4% [11]. This demonstrates

76

the utility of calprotectin for PJI diagnosis and the need for a validated lateral flow test.

77

Lyfstone have recently developed a lateral flow calprotectin test for the diagnosis of PJI which has

78

passed the European IVD regulatory approval process (98/79/EC). We conducted the first clinical

79

evaluation of this new technology in a retrospective study on samples from suspected PJI or aseptic

80

loosening cases to assess the sensitivity, specificity, NPV and PPV.

81
82

Materials and Methods

83

A total of 73 synovial fluid samples collected as a convenience series and stored in the Biorepository

84

at the University of East Anglia between February 2016 and January 2019 as part of routine clinical

85

practice from patients treated at the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospitals (NNUH) were

86

retrospectively tested for calprotectin levels with the Lyfstone lateral flow test. Informed consent was

87

obtained from all patients included in the study. Ethical approval was provided by University of East

88

Anglia, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences Research Ethics Committee, project reference:

89

2016/17 21 SE. Samples were only tested if of sufficient volume (≥100µL) and results for

90

microbiological culture, frozen-section histology and serum C-Reactive Protein (CRP) were available.

91

Four samples were removed from the analysis due to incomplete/erroneous patient data (two had no

92

pre-operative notes and two were from a patient who had two separate surgeries, but the samples had

93

the same date). The final total of 69 samples were included in the dataset (37 male, 32 female, age

94

range 45-89), 52 were taken during hip revision surgery and 17 from knee revisions.

95

Cases were classified as either infected or aseptic based on the MSIS criteria (Table 1). A case was

96

deemed as infected if the patient presented either with a major criterion, i.e. two or more cultures of

97

the same organism or the presence of a sinus tract; or met three minor criteria i.e. elevated serum CRP

98

levels, purulence, one positive microbiological culture and/or positive histological analysis of

99

periprosthetic tissue for inflammation. Other minor criteria from the 2018 MSIS criteria were not

Discrepant results were investigated by one of the senior authors (IM - Consultant Orthopaedic

106

Surgeon) and team by reviewing patient medical records, surgical notes and X-rays to make a definite

107

decision on whether the patients were managed by the clinical team as infected (MSIS+).

108

The Lyfstone calprotectin test was carried out according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Synovial

109

fluid samples (20l) were diluted in a pre-mixed dilution buffer (2 ml – 101x dilution) and added to

110

the test cassette (80l). Gold-conjugated antibody complexes then bind calprotectin and travel along

111

the membrane within the cassette and further bind to immobilised calprotectin-specific antibodies to

112

form a visible test line. Any remaining gold-conjugated antibody not bound to calprotectin is

113

immobilised on a control line. After 15 minutes incubation at room temperature the cassette was

114

photo-imaged, and the calprotectin level calculated by the Lyfstone smartphone application (Figure

115

1). The colour intensity of the test line is proportional to the concentration of calprotectin in the

116

sample. A calprotectin result of ≤14 mg/L was considered a negative result according to the cut-off

117

between low and moderate risk of infection by the Lyfstone smartphone app at the time of testing.

Microbiological culture was performed on all tissue and fluid specimens (recommended that 3-5

124

tissue/fluid samples sent for testing) for 48 hours on blood agar and chocolate agar, five days on

125

146

positive culture (Collinsella aeofasciens and ‘Diptheroids’) and the remaining infected case was

147

positive by a combination of histology, CRP and purulence (Table 2).

148

In this infected group there were 18 true positive and 6 false negative results by calprotectin. The

149

reported organisms in these false negative cases were Cutibacterium acnes (n=3), Bacteroides fragilis

with Corynebacterium tuberculostearicum (n=1).

152

The remaining 45 cases were aseptic by MSIS criteria and of these 34 were true negative and 11 were

153

false positive by calprotectin. Of the 11 false positive cases, one case was positive for inflammation

154

by histology and elevated CRP and one was CRP positive without significant histology. The

In the hip group, medical record and radiological review revealed 7/11 false positive results were

173

associated with metallosis from patients who were being revised for metal on metal hip implants, an

174

expected trigger for gross inflammation [16] thereby resulting in high calprotectin and false positive

175

results. The remaining four false positive cases had aseptic loosening listed as the initial indication for

176

operation. Review of pre-operative radiographs revealed gross osteolysis in 3 out of 4 cases, with

177

gross destruction of either proximal femur or acetabulum. This again is likely to cause false positive

178

calprotectin results. One-year follow-up of one of the three patients (patient 35) revealed that they

179

were still experiencing pain in their joint and their CRP had raised from 1 mg/L to 19 mg/L

180

(Supplementary table 1), indicating possible infection, but as yet still under investigation by the

181

treating teams. Removal of metallosis and severe osteolysis cases from the dataset improved the

182

specificity, PPV and overall accuracy of the test both against MSIS and MSIS+ (Table 4).

191

The three false negative results within the hip subset were all MSIS positive by culture alone (two or

192

more cultures of the same organism). Patient 18 was culture positive for B. fragilis, isolated from all

193

cultured tissue samples, along with a high CRP and noted joint purulence. Calprotectin was recorded

194

at 13.36 mg/L which falls just below the threshold value for a positive result (≥14 mg/L)

195

(Supplementary table 1). Sample 48 was culture positive for C. acnes but negative by both histology

196

and CRP. The calprotectin test was negative with 0.0 mg/L. The initial indication for operation for

197

this case was aseptic loosening and a single stage revision was performed - the C. acnes report was

198

dismissed as contamination and the patient was not treated for infection. One-year follow-up of the

199

patient showed no signs of infection indicating that the calprotectin result correlated with the clinical

200

findings. Sample 56 was a similar case of an aseptic loosening revision yielding a significant culture

201

results (P. aeruginosa and Corynebacterium) but no detectable synovial fluid calprotectin. The patient

202

had a single stage revision and upon a two-month follow-up, showed no sign of infection, indicating a

203

true negative calprotectin result. The clinical review (MSIS+) increases the sensitivity of the Lyfstone

204

test from 75% to 94.74% (Table 3).

205

In the knee group, three false negative results were recorded; two cases of C. acnes and one case

206

reporting S. epidermidis. Both C. acnes cases (Samples 50 and 57) were patients displaying no pre-

207

operative indication of infection and were treated as aseptic loosening. The clinical review found no

208

complications after patient follow up suggesting both cases were aseptic and the calprotectin results

209

were correct. Sample 21 (S. epidermidis) was taken during the second stage of revision surgery

210

performed one year after the first stage operation. Clinical review revealed the patient was originally

211

treated for gross infection. At the time of the second stage revision, the patient showed no overt signs

212

of infection, so treatment progressed to implantation of the prosthesis. Post-operative microbiology

213

grew a culture of S. epidermidis from 3/6 samples taken at the time of surgery. At the one-year

214

follow-up the patient presented no sign of infection, confirming the calprotectin result to be correct,

thus far. Overall, the Lyfstone test was 100% accurate for the diagnosis of PJI in knee samples (n=17

216

– Tables 2 and 3).

217
218

Discussion

219

PJI is a serious complication of total joint arthroplasty with associated patient morbidity and the

220

economic burden of treatment. Microbiological culture techniques are slow and insensitive and

221

although new diagnostic tests are being developed, none of the current methods are capable of reliably

222

diagnosing PJI.

223

Rapid biomarker-based tests have the potential to assist clinicians in making a pre-operative

224

diagnosis. Early differentiation of PJI from aseptic loosening may reduce the number of unnecessary

225

two-stage revisions performed on patients with a presumptive diagnosis of low-grade infection.

226

Zimmer Biomet have developed the Synovasure® Test, which functions very similarly to the

227

Lyfstone calprotectin test, measuring another neutrophil released antimicrobial peptide, α-defensin.

228

Studies using Synovasure® have shown varying results with sensitivities ranging from 67% to 100%

229

and specificities ranging from 82.4% to 100% against the MSIS criteria [17-25]. A systematic review

230

summarising the results of seven prospective trials found the Synovasure® lateral flow test had an

231

overall sensitivity of 85% and a specificity of 90% [26].

232

The performance of the Lyfstone calprotectin rapid test was determined using MSIS and MSIS+

233

standards. Comparing the results to the MSIS criteria, the PPV was 62% and NPV was 85%. Further

234

analysis revealed that the low PPV is heavily affected by the presence of metallosis cases from

235

revision of metal on metal implants within our sample set. Removing these samples yields a PPV of

236

79%. The use of biomarker based diagnostic tests is known to be unreliable in patients with metal-on-

237

metal implants as it can cause gross inflammation producing false positive results [27]. This effect

238

was observed in our study with seven of 13 metal-on-metal revisions producing false positive results

239

(true positive = 3, true negative = 3). Patients with evidence of severe osteolysis also contributed a

240

disproportionate number of false positive results (n=3). Removing both metallosis and osteolysis

241

cases resulted in a PPV of 93.8%.

242

Compared to MSIS, six false negative results were observed. Three of these were MSIS positive by

243

culture of C. acnes. This organism is a common lab contaminant and not typically considered a cause

244

of infection when isolated from hip and knee tissues [28-30]. In fact, 5/6 false negative Lyfstone test

245

results were shown to be true negatives when compared to the MSIS+ clinical standard, highlighting

246

the need for improved diagnostics. Only one case of infection was missed (case 18) in which the

247

calprotectin result was very close to positive (13.36mg/L, < 1 mg/L below the positive cut-off). If

248

future optimisation of the test sets a lower threshold value for infection, then this case would have

249

been classified as positive. Such a readjustment of the calprotectin cut-off values may improve test

250

performance in detecting low-grade infections.

251

The sensitivity of the Lyfstone test increased from 75% to 94.74% when using the MSIS+ compared

252

to the MSIS criteria and the NPV increased from 85% to 97.5%. There was only a modest increase in

253

specificity and no increase in PPV. However, excluding both metallosis and osteolysis patients

254

increased specificity to 97.3% and PPV to 93.75%.

255

Test accuracy was different for hip and knee revisions. False positive results were only observed in

256

hip revisions, not in knee revision as there was no metal-on-metal reactions or significant osteolysis in

257

the knee revision group. Compared to MSIS+, the Lyfstone test was 100% accurate for the diagnosis

258

of PJI in knee revisions, however the sample size is small (n=17) and more data is required to confirm

259

these findings.

260

One limitation of this study is the use of retrospective samples, however, by testing all eligible

261

samples in the biorepository we believe that we did not introduce any sample selection bias. Another

262

limitation was the samples had been frozen for storage before testing and the freeze-thaw process may

263

result in leukocyte cell lysis and an increase in calprotectin. As the test is validated for use on fresh

264

synovial fluid samples, the recommended cut-offs may not necessarily be appropriate for our samples.

265

It is worth noting that blood contamination of the samples had no impact on the accuracy of the test

266

results, something the Synovasure® lateral flow test warns may lead to false negative results [31].

267

In conclusion, the Lyfstone calprotectin assay shows good potential as a rapid diagnostic test for PJI

268

due to its high sensitivity and NPV. The test has a low PPV compared to MSIS and MSIS+ but the

269

false positive results are mostly in patients with metal on metal reactions or significant osteolysis,

270

which could serve as contraindications for use. Prospective studies on fresh samples in appropriate

271

patient populations are required to accurately define test performance.
