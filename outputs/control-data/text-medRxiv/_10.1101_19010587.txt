SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT AND INNOVATION SCALE UP

27

Abstract

28

Objectives To explore how sociocultural factors may support or impede the adoption of

29

community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives in Nigeria.

30

Design A qualitative study based on a grounded theory approach was conducted through in-

31

depth interviews and focus group discussions.

32

Setting Most participants lived in Gombe State, North East Nigeria. Other participants were

33

from Ibadan (South West) and Abuja (Federal capital territory).

34

Participants Through seven key informant interviews, 15 in-depth interviews and 10 focus

35

group discussions, 102 participants were involved in the study.

36

Methods This study, conducted in 2016 was part of a larger study on scale up of community-

37

based distribution of injectable contraceptives. Qualitative data were collected from

38

traditional and religious leaders, health workers and community members. The data were

39

audio recorded, transcribed and analysed using a thematic framework method.

40

Results Sociocultural challenges to scale up included patriarchy and men’s fear of losing

41

control over their spouses, traditional and religious beliefs about fertility, and myths about

42

contraceptives and family planning. As a result of deep-rooted beliefs that children are

43

‘divine blessings’ and that procreation should not be regulated, participants described a subtle

44

resistance to uptake of injectable contraceptives. Since Gombe is largely a patriarchal society,

45

male involvement emerged as important to the success of meaningful innovation uptake.

46

Community leaders largely described their participation in the scale up process as active,

47

although they also identified scope for further involvement and recognition.

48

Conclusion Scale up is more than setting up health sector implementing structures, training

49

health workers and getting innovation supplies, but also requires preparedness which includes

50

paying attention to complex contextual issues. This requires the health system and those who

51

work in it, to move beyond a narrow health ‘comfort zone’ by actively engaging with, and

52

learning from, those who are leading, caring for and living in, the community.

SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT AND INNOVATION SCALE UP

84

1. Introduction

85

Scale up of effective health innovations, through their increased availability to a larger

86

population over a wider geographic area, is essential for achieving universal health coverage,

87

particularly in developing countries.1 2 Scale up is influenced by various factors related to the

88

innovation, the users, and the social context in which the innovation is introduced.3 The

89

nature of the innovation itself, preferences and characteristics of the intended users (including

90

their willingness to adopt the innovation), and ways that the innovation is adapted to the local

91

context are also some of the factors affecting innovation scale up.4

92

The sociocultural context, which includes religious and cultural beliefs, gender and societal

93

norms and attitudes, is an important predictor of adoption of a health innovation in a

94

population.5 6 The sociocultural context may promote health or be a barrier to health

95

utilization.7 For example, cultural beliefs and practices have been shown to influence the

96

uptake of a range of health innovations including male circumcision,8 breast cancer

97

screening7 9 and contraceptives.10 11 Without due consideration of the sociocultural context,

98

health innovation development, delivery and scale up is likely to be limited, if not

99

dangerous!12

100

Evidence highlights the influence of sociocultural context on the adoption of contraceptive

101

innovations. For example, in a study in rural Poland, Colleran and Mace13 reported that

102

religious and sociocultural factors, particularly social networks, influence the uptake of

103

contraceptive use more than individual characteristics. Dalaba and colleagues14 in their study

104

in northern Ghana reported that inadequate male participation led to resistance towards

105

female reproductive freedom. Interventions at societal level, such as adequate male

106

mobilisation coupled with appropriate community-based distribution strategies were shown

107

to be effective in improving contraceptive uptake.14 In Nigeria, where society is largely

108

patriarchal, with consequences for access to and use of contraceptives, a study found that

109

about two-thirds of rural women who had spousal approval were reported to use

110

contraceptives while all those who were forbidden by their husbands did not use any family

111

planning method.15 Understanding whether and how the sociocultural context influences

112

scale up of contraceptive innovation is thus important.

113

Nigeria started its family planning policy review in 2007 and successfully piloted the

114

community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives through community health

SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT AND INNOVATION SCALE UP

116

State, North-eastern region.16 17 Afterwards, the scale up of this innovation started in 2014,

117

led by a national non-governmental organization and supported by international donor

118

agencies.18

119

According to Bradley et al,3 assessing the receptivity and willingness of community members

120

to adopt a health innovation within their environmental and sociocultural settings is one of

121

the key first steps in the scale up process. In their conception, poor understanding by

122

implementers of potential users’ sociocultural context will limit scale up efforts, while good

123

understanding will help program managers to recognise contextual factors that may enhance

124

or inhibit the uptake of an innovation.3 However, the understanding of how sociocultural

125

contextual factors may facilitate or impede the successful scale up of the contraceptive

126

innovation beyond the initial pilot site in Nigeria is limited. This study therefore assesses how

127

sociocultural factors may influence the scale up of the community-based distribution of

128

injectable contraceptives in Nigeria.

129

2. Methods

130

2.1 Study design and setting

131

This cross-sectional study conducted from September to November 2016, part of a larger

132

research project on scale up of community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives,

133

took place in Gombe (North eastern Nigeria), one of 36 States in Nigeria. Gombe State, with

134

a population of 2,353,879 people according to the 2006 population census,19 has one of the

135

lowest contraceptive prevalence rates in the country (3.5% for modern methods and 4.0% for

136

any method) and one of the highest maternal mortality rates (1,726/100,000).16 20 21 Gombe

137

was purposively selected because it was the setting for the national pilot test for community-

138

based distribution of injectable contraceptives in 2010. Gombe is divided administratively

139

into 11 Local Government Areas (LGAs). The study held in two LGAs – Gombe (A) and

140

Yamaltu/Deba (B). Although participants were primarily based in Gombe State, one

141

interview took place in Ibadan (South west) and 3 interviews in Abuja (Federal Capital

142

Territory).

143

Participants and sample

144

Qualitative data were collected from a range of stakeholders, including traditional and

145

religious leaders, health workers as well as community members, through seven key

146

informant interviews, 15 in-depth interviews and 10 focus group discussions (see Table 1). In

147

total, 102 people participated in this study. The participants were selected through a

148

purposive sampling method, where study respondents are recruited based on characteristics of

149

interest, availability, and ability to provide relevant information to the research question:22 23

150

how may sociocultural context influence the process of introducing, translating and

151

integrating health innovation? The number of interviews and FGDs was determined by the

152

principle of saturation in qualitative study, a point where no new data is being gotten.24

153

This study adopted the grounded theory approach using inductive reasoning. This approach is

154

appropriate for this study since it is exploratory in nature and principles are being derived

155

from specific observations.24 25 Of the three authors, two are women, two are physician-

156

researchers and two are domiciled in Africa.

2.2 Data collection

161

Interview guide and focus group guide were used to conduct the interviews and focus group

162

discussions, respectively (see Supplementary file 1). The interview guides for the discussions

163

with community members and interview with traditional leaders were translated to the

164

predominant local language - Hausa. The main issues covered in the interview and

165

discussions included community perceptions about contraceptives and specifically about the

166

innovation (community-based delivery of contraceptives), their role in the scale up process,

167

as well as their views regarding the sociocultural challenges and facilitators of the scale up

168

process and community engagement regarding the scale up. Interviews and discussions were

169

tape-recorded and later translated and transcribed in full.

170

2.3 Data analysis

171

Transcripts were analyzed iteratively with the aid of the NVIVO (version 10) software using

172

the thematic framework approach.24 25 The pre-defined thematic areas included features of the

173

sociocultural context that may influence scale up of the innovation. These were: community

174

members’ perceptions regarding community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives,

175

community members’ acceptance (or rejection) of contraceptives, and community

176

engagement in the scale up process. Emerging themes were also considered and were indexed

and compared with themes from subsequent interviews until saturation was attained.

178

Interviews were stopped at the point of saturation, where no new information was obtained.24

179

The authors reviewed the transcripts and compared themes, before these were applied to

180

subsequent coding of all the transcripts. The SRQR reporting guidelines for qualitative

181

studies26 was used in preparing this manuscript.

182

2.4 Ethics approval and consent to participate

183

Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the University of Ibadan/University

184

College Hospital Ethical Review Board (Reference No.: UI/EC/16/0022) as well as the

185

Human Research Ethics Committee (Medical) of the University of the Witwatersrand

186

(Reference No.: M160737). Written informed consent were obtained from study participants

187

before the interviews and FGDs (see Supplementary file 2). Participants were also assured of

188

confidentiality by ensuring that all identifiers were removed from the data and that only the

189

research team has access to the data.

3.1 Deep rooted cultural and religious beliefs about fertility

199

Participants spoke about a deep-rooted belief amongst community members that children are

200

‘divine blessings’ and that procreation should not be regulated. Emerging from this world

201

view, participants described a subtle resistance to the uptake of injectable contraceptives,

202

more passive than overt in its expression by individuals and families who would feign

203

acceptance but refuse the intervention when given.

205

people that believe that children are a blessing, so you give birth to as many as

206

possible. …The resistance may not be as a group, but when you come to individual

207

levels… as a government, they might not show you the resistance, but when it comes

208

to the actual usage, that’s where you start having problems.” (IDI, male, Doctor,

209

SMoH)

210

Also, there were issues about religious beliefs influencing perception about family planning/

211

contraceptive use at the community level. Religiosity, that is, strong adherence to religious

212

beliefs, was said to be one of the major factors impeding the uptake of contraceptives in

213

general.

214

“…when you look at northern Nigeria, majority are Muslims and when you look at

215

the south eastern states, you know we have issue of religion, issue of uptake of all

216

contraceptives, not even injectables alone. To the south eastern man, most of them are

217

Catholics, they frown at family planning, so also here (northern Nigeria) people

218

frown at family planning in general” (KII, male, Senior official, SMoH).

219

3.2 Awareness and perceptions regarding family planning

220

Most interview respondents agreed that there was a need to continue to educate community

221

members about the overall benefits of contraceptives and family planning as well as

222

emphasize possible side effects of contraceptives use among women. Also, informants were

223

of the opinion that lack of knowledge about benefits of contraception contributes to

224

reluctance to adopt the innovation. In the words of a respondent:

225

“…the community and people at the grassroots have little information (on

226

contraceptives)” (KII, female, Senior official, SMoH).

227

These challenges were further compounded by reports of adverse effects of the contraception

228

from some women especially “severe bleeding during menstruation” (IDI, female, CHEW).

229

Healthcare providers felt that to effectively deal with these challenges, it was important to

230

listen sympathetically to the women and treat reported side effects, in line with the training

231

received for the innovation scale up. Education was also given when clients had questions in

232

order to resolve doubts about the innovation. For example, a respondent said:

233
234

“We listen to them, and we explain to them that since it (contraceptive) is a new thing

235

group used injectable contraceptives, including desire to stay attractive in order to prevent

236

husbands from ‘straying’, space the children and enjoy life with fewer financial and parenting

237

constraints. One of the discussants who currently uses injectable contraceptives described her

238

motivation thus:

239

“…If we space our children well, we will enjoy our lives because our husbands will

240

always desire us since we are always looking attractive. He will not stay out late

241

because he will be thinking of you at home” (FGD, female, current user).

242

Also, a participant stated that the impetus for contraceptive use was the fact that spacing her

243

children afforded her the ability to take care of herself and the home thereby promoting

244

hygiene and healthy living in the home. She said:

245

“…You will be able to take care of yourself as well as your house, your husband will

246

also desire you as you will look good as well as your children. Flies will not follow

247

you around and anyone that comes to your house will be able to eat and drink

248

because everywhere is clean and attractive” (FGD, female, current user).

249

3.3 Perceptions regarding the community-based distribution (CBD) approach

250

Many of the women who were current users of injectable contraceptives stated their

251

preference for the community-based approach over the facility-based system of distributing

252

the contraceptives. Some of their reasons for this position included convenience, affordability

253

(saves cost as transport fare is not needed), improved privacy and focused attention from the

254

health worker.

255

“…During home visit, it’s between you and the woman (health worker) and she can

256

explain it very well to you since she is not in a hurry; although in the hospital they

257

can also explain but the home visit is better since the health worker will explain until

258

you understand.” (FGD, female, current user).

259

Likewise, some male discussants preferred the community-based approach because they

260

believed it was more confidential and gave women more time to deal with domestic issues.

261

The CBD approach was also believed to align with men’s desire to be in control of ‘family

262

issues’.

263

“…Maybe the time the wife wants to go (to the health facility) the husband needed her

264

for something else…Sometimes some husbands want all these things to be

265

confidential, but when you now tell them to release their wives to the hospital, they

266

will think you are exposing the family issues” (FGD, married men).

267

However, one of the discussants who favoured the facility-based approach ‘prefer[ed] to go

268

to the hospital, so I can be checked properly, including to check my BP” (FGD, female,

269

current user). Similarly, some married men also preferred the facility-based approach as they

270

believed that the community-based method is intrusive of their privacy and undermines their

271

authority:

272

“…My advice is that the woman should come to hospital …because some husbands

273

will query you that who gave you the permission to see their wives (at home) and

274

advise them about child spacing. Some disagree with the community-based method”

275

(FGD, married men).

276

3.4 Spousal involvement in family planning

277

In addition, male involvement was highlighted as important if uptake of innovation will be

278

meaningful since Gombe is largely a society where the women need the men’s permission for

279

doing many things including obtaining injectable contraceptives.

280

“Some men will not accept it (contraceptive) because they want plenty children…she

281

(the wife) should continue begging the husband until he agrees if she wants to use

282

contraceptives” (FGD, women not using contraceptives).

283

Furthermore, cultural beliefs and sociocultural context were reported as fuelling poor

284

awareness and knowledge about contraceptive use. Also, male involvement was described as

285

important in dealing with the problem of ignorance and poor perception about family

286

planning in the community. According to the participants in this study, once the men are well

287

informed, it is easier to get their buy-in and cooperation in permitting their wives to get the

288

injections.

289

“…some of the men don’t know much about family planning commodities and some

290

(people) are telling them some of the side effects. So, they prevent the women from

291

using them…that’s why we need more sensitization to the men and the youths” (IDI,

292

female, Nurse).

293

“The perception of men (about contraceptives) is lower than that of women. The

294

women know the implications better than the men. The men in the rural areas don’t

295

mind having any number of children...” (FGD, married men)

296

Also, a female health worker emphasised the importance of male involvement particularly in

297

communities where the literacy rate is low:

298

“Honestly. we need to do more in carrying them [men] along. Male involvement is

299

very important because you know they are our superiors. We in the North, it is only

300

the educated that may be sometimes at loggerhead (with their husbands)… but these

301

illiterates and native people, it is always the man that is superior. So, it is very

302

important for us to consider male involvement, it will help a lot (IDI, female, Nurse).

303

3.5 Community support for scale up

304

The traditional leaders interviewed believed that community support for the innovation is

305

very high.

306

“In fact, the support our community gives to this programme, without exageration, I

307

will say maybe 80-90%. They (the community) have been very supportive of the

308

programme” (IDI, male, Traditional ruler, Yemaltu-Deba).

309

“Definitely, you have 70% support from the communities. From the religious leaders,

310

traditional rulers and even of ward heads in the community we get 100% support”

311

(IDI, male, Traditional leader, Gombe).

312

However, some cautioned that the community support is not as high as expected due to what

313

they call low knowledge and awareness about contraceptive choices in Northern Nigeria.

314

“…Really, people have supported the program but I know some people do not have

315

the knowledge (about injectable contraceptives) but those that have the knowledge

316

are really in support of the program… [you know] the Northern culture prohibits

317

some things, that’s why I said the support for it (injectable contraceptives scale up) is

318

not as much as we expect.” (IDI, male, Christian religious leader)

One community leader described his role as active in the scale up process because he helps in

320

disseminating information to all the wards under his domain. He shared his experience:

321

“Whenever the need arises, we normally call the kingmakers, district head

322

kingmakers, they are about seven, and we have at least 54 ward heads, we use to call

Many of the leaders ascribed the progress with the scale up in their communities to the

involvement of the traditional leaders in the programme. However, some leaders complained

325

of not being officially involved in the programme, although they still offer their support.

326

“There are so many traditional rulers that were involved in this program; that is the

327

reason why it has been accepted 100%, especially in Gombe State now” (IDI, male,

328

Traditional leader, Gombe).

“…My involvement is…passive involvement. Of course, we preachers, you can push

4. Discussion

334

In our study, there were a number of sociocultural issues alluded to as factors that may affect

335

scale up of a contraceptive innovation in Nigeria, including patriarchy, traditional and

336

religious norms, beliefs and myths about contraceptives and family planning. Agunbiade &

337

Ogunleye27 reported in their study assessing the sociocultural barriers to the scale up of

338

exclusive breastfeeding in Nigeria, the scale up process cannot be separated from the context

339

and the culture in the environment. Further, in a study among African American women,

340

culture and health beliefs were found to be significant predictors of health innovation

341

uptake.28

342

Our study indicates it is vital to secure the understanding and support of the men and

343

significant others for scale up of the community-based distribution of injectable

344

contraceptives to succeed in environments like our study site that are still largely

345

patriarchal.27 Similar to the findings of our study, male involvement and support of women’s

346

significant others, particularly the mothers-in-law, have been reported to be crucial to

347

innovation scale up in Nigeria as these significant others have strong influence on choices

348

made by women.27 In other settings, increased male participation through increasing men’s

349

knowledge and reducing their opposition has been shown to improve uptake and continued

350

use of contraceptives29-31 and enhancement of prevention of mother to child transmission of

351

HIV (PMTCT) scale up processes.32 In this study, one of the reasons why women reportedly

352

use contraceptives was to look attractive and satisfy their husbands in order to prevent them

353

from engaging in extramarital relationships. Thus, contraception is both liberating for women

354

on one hand but also perhaps serving the very patriarchy they are trapped in on the other.

SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT AND INNOVATION SCALE UP

355

Studies have shown that in many African societies, patriarchy is perpetuated by the

356

socialisation process which starts from the family and is often preserved by women

357

themselves.33 34

358

Also, findings from our study show passive resistance to contraceptive uptake, particularly at

359

the individual levels. Research has shown that passive resistance is one of the major reasons

360

for the high failure rate of innovation scale up.35 36 Passive resistance often results from

361

individuals’ resistance to change and contentment with or lack of power to change the status

362

quo.36 Further, consumers will not adopt an innovation if they are not sure of its value or

363

benefits.37 According to Heidenreich and Kraemer, passive innovation resistance should be

364

addressed before the introduction of new innovations into the society.35 Strategies for

365

reducing passive resistance to uptake of health innovations in the community include actively

366

involving men in their uptake,14 as well as giving adequate and correct information about the

367

advantages of contraceptive use to all stakeholders - health workers, community and religious

368

leaders, trained volunteers and program managers.37

369

Since the passive resistance reported in this study is largely underpinned by deep-seated

370

issues of patriarchy, religious beliefs and traditional norms/values, it is imperative for policy

371

makers and program managers to engage men – who are custodians, in most cases, of both

372

religious and cultural values.38 39 Male involvement can bring benefits for all community

373

stakeholders,38 as well as social change.40 With careful management and ongoing monitoring,

374

the involvement of men may ultimately give the scale up of this health innovation a greater

375

chance of success.

376

Furthermore, religious beliefs were also found to influence scale up of the community-based

377

injectable contraceptives and family planning in general in our study sites in Northern

378

Nigeria. Religion has been shown to significantly influence decisions on contraceptive use,41

379

as well as individual/household choices, lifestyle and even traditional values.42 Thus,

380

religion has great implications for the social marketing of commodities particularly

381

contraceptives, as uptake of health products has been shown to differ significantly among

382

adherents of major religions.42 For example, research done in Islamic countries43 44 highlights

383

the need to understand Islamic religion in order to do effective social marketing, and

384

recommends that approval be obtained from religious leadership before certain sensitive

385

products like contraceptives are marketed. Understanding religious nuances in local contexts

386

is important in multi-faith countries such as Nigeria – for example, what ‘works’ in the

387

largely-Islamic North45 may need adaptation for Christian populations elsewhere.

388

Our study demonstrated the importance of strong community support and partnership with

389

community gate-keepers in the scale up process. Research has shown that the CBD approach

390

cannot succeed without community participation.46 Therefore, programme implementers need

391

to learn from the community what works (or may work) in the setting, what distribution

392

method the community prefers or what modification to the existing methods they favour.

393

Research has shown that there is no quick fix to scaling up.46 It is essentially a learning

394

process which is unique in different contexts. Therefore, scale up may not be effective

395

without adequate contextual knowledge and willingness to learn through the process of

396

community participation and stakeholder collaboration.46 47

397

While the focus of this paper has been on challenges as identified in the wider context of

398

religion and patriarchy, many of the suggested solutions rely on the health systems and those

399

working in it, to navigate these challenges and overcome them. However, this cannot be a

400

static or reactive approach but rather needs to recognise that health systems and those

401

working in them are also part of the sociocultural context and therefore it is important to find

402

ways to support healthcare workers in mediating, translating and promoting the innovation in

403

this context.

404

4.1 Limitations of the study

405

Some limitations of this study should be emphasised. As with any qualitative study, the

406

findings are not statistically generalizable but the theories and ideas can be applied to other

407

contexts. Thus, the findings of this study provide valuable information into how sociocultural

408

context and user support affect the scale up of health innovations in LMICs, particularly in a

409

patriarchal society like Nigeria.

410

4.2 Recommendations

411

Further studies are needed on the barriers and facilitators to community-based distribution of

412

health innovations.41 Although the pilot project16 provided some evidence that community-

413

based distribution is feasible in Nigeria, more understanding about what may impede or

414

enhance this approach to health commodity distribution is needed. In addition, incorporating

415

the CBD approach with other outreach programmes, developing a more effective supervision

416

of the approach may help make CBD more productive.

SOCIOCULTURAL CONTEXT AND INNOVATION SCALE UP

418

Our study revealed a number of sociocultural factors influencing the scale up of community-

419

based distribution of injectable contraceptives in Nigeria. These include subtle resistance to

420

innovation uptake as a result of deep-rooted cultural and religious beliefs about fertility and

421

contraceptive use, influence of patriarchy and prominent role of traditional and religious

422

leaders on innovation uptake. Findings also suggest the need for continuous community

423

education and engagement with the significant others and community leadership structures –

424

both traditional and religious. Thus, providing an innovation does not necessarily translate to

425

uptake. Therefore, program implementers should also consider sociocultural and health

426

system contexts when packaging a health innovation. Hence, supporting those in the health

427

system to mediate the innovation in ways that are sensitive to the context but which, by

428

working with communities and others, promotes transformation is imperative. Policy

429

implementers should also see scale up as a learning process and be willing to move at the

430

speed of the community.
