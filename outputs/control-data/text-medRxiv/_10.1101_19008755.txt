Summary: In a multicenter retrospective cohort study, we show that the real-world clinical
impact of plasma metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) for the noninvasive
diagnosis of infections is limited (positive impact 7.3%). Further studies are needed to
optimize the impact of mNGS.

Abstract
Background: Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of plasma cell-free
DNA has emerged as an attractive diagnostic modality allowing broad-range pathogen
detection, noninvasive sampling, and earlier diagnosis. However, little is known about its
real-world clinical impact as used in routine practice.
Methods: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all patients for whom plasma
mNGS (Karius test) was performed for all indications at 5 U.S. institutions over 1.5 years.
Comprehensive chart review was performed, and standardized assessment of clinical
impact of the mNGS based on the treating team’s interpretation of Karius results and
patient management was established.
Results: A total of 82 Karius tests were evaluated, from 39 (47.6%) adults and 43 (52.4%)
children and a total of 53 (64.6%) immunocompromised patients. Karius positivity rate
was 50/82 (61.0%), with 24 (48.0%) showing two or more organisms (range, 2-8). The
Karius test results led to positive impact in 6 (7.3%), negative impact in 3 (3.7%), no
impact in 70 (85.4%), and was indeterminate in 3 (3.7%). Cases with positive Karius result
and clinical impact involved bacteria and/or fungi but not DNA viruses or parasites. In 10
patients who underwent 16 additional repeated tests, only one was associated with
clinical impact.
Conclusions: The real-world impact of the Karius test as currently used in routine clinical
practice is limited. Further studies are needed to identify high-yield patient populations,
define the complementary role of mNGS to conventional microbiological methods, and
how best to integrate mNGS into current testing algorithms.

Introduction
Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) of pathogen nucleic acid in
clinical samples has emerged as a promising one-test approach for hypothesis-free
diagnosis of potentially all infectious etiologies. mNGS is currently orderable in select
reference laboratories from plasma cell-free DNA (Karius, Redwood City, CA), from DNA
and RNA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (University of California, San Francisco) and DNA
and RNA in respiratory secretions (IDbyDNA, San Francisco, CA) [1]. Of these, the Karius
test has been commercially available the longest and is likely the most common mNGS
send-out test in U.S. institutions. This assay is reported to detect and quantify pathogen
cell-free DNA from 1,250 bacteria, DNA viruses, fungi and eukaryotic parasites [2], and
has been employed for the diagnosis of invasive fungal disease [3, 4], communityacquired pneumonia [5] and infections in immunocompromised hosts [6, 7].

The availability of clinical metagenomic cell-free DNA sequencing has generated
interest from clinical providers across disciplines given the noninvasive nature of testing,
and the potential to pose an actionable diagnosis faster than through conventional
microbiologic methods. However, little is known about the clinical impact of mNGS testing
when used for routine patient care. A study assessing the clinical impact of mNGS from
CSF in patients with suspected meningitis and encephalitis showed positive clinical
impact in 8/204 (3.9%) patients tested [8]. In the present multicenter study, our aim was
to comprehensively examine the real-world clinical impact of the Karius test ordered for
all indications for the diagnosis of infectious diseases.

Methods
Ethics. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRB) at Stanford
University and Columbia Medical Center (CUMC). IRB was waived for this project for
University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), University of Utah (UT) and Children’s
Hospital of Los Angeles (CHLA).

Karius Test. The Karius laboratory started to offer commercial testing in December 2016.
Plasma from whole blood collected in a K2-EDTA or BD Vacutainer PPT tube (Becton
Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ) and separated <6 hours after draw was sent either fresh
(within 4 days of blood draw) or frozen. All testing was performed by Karius per routine
testing protocol as previously described [2].

Study Design. We performed a retrospective cohort study of patients for all consecutive
plasma mNGS samples sent-out for Karius test from 5 U.S. institutions (CHLA, CUMC,
Stanford Health Care, UCLA and UT) from August 1st 2017 to May 31st 2019.
Comprehensive chart review was performed by each site investigator for respective
patients, and clinical impact solely based on the treating team’s interpretation of Karius
results and their subsequent management decisions was assessed according to
predefined objective grading criteria (Table 1) as to whether Karius test result had a
positive, negative, or no clinical impact, or if impact was indeterminate. This study
intended to assess the real-world impact of Karius test and therefore only the treating
team’s decisions and actions were considered for impact assessment, and no
retrospective clinical consensus assessment of impact and adjudication by a panel of

experts was performed. Given that Karius testing may be reordered in the same patient
for different reasons including patient monitoring, the main analysis was performed on the
first Karius test per patient. A separate analysis was performed on repeat tests.

Statistical Analysis. Statistical analysis was performed with Stata 15 (Stata Corp, TX,
USA). Due to the descriptive nature of the review, a formal sample size calculation was
not performed.

Results
A total of 82 Karius tests were performed in unique patients cared for at UCLA
(n=50 tests), SHC (n=21), CUMC (n=5), UT (n=3) and CHLA (n=3) (Table 2). There were
39 (47.6%) adults and 43 (52.4%) children, 52 (63.4%) males and 53 (64.6%)
immunocompromised patients, most commonly solid organ transplant (17.1%) and
primary immunodeficiency (13.4%) (Table 2). The mean turn-around-time from sample
collection to result was 3.1 days (SD: 1.2), and the most common ordering providers were
infectious disease physicians (74.4%), followed by oncologists (11.0%). The main
indication for testing was fever of unknown origin (23.2%), suspected respiratory infection
(13.4%), sepsis (9.8%), suspected endocarditis (8.5%) and febrile neutropenia (7.3%).
The Karius positivity rate was 50/82 (61.0%), with 26 (52.0%) of these tests resulted as
monomicrobial (18 bacterial, 5 viral and 3 fungal), and 24 (48.0%) showing 2 or more
organisms (range, 2-8). There was no parasite detected in this cohort.

The Karius test results led to positive or negative clinical impact in 9 (11.0%) tests.
The impact was positive in 6 (7.3%) and negative in 3 (3.7%) (Table 3). Of these 9 Karius
tests, 8 had organisms detected while 1 had no organism detected. Impact was none in
70 (85.4%) tests and indeterminate in 3 (3.7%). All 8 cases with positive Karius result and
clinical impact involved bacteria and/or fungi; determination of the presence or absence
of DNA viruses by plasma mNGS demonstrated no clinical impact in this study. Positive
clinical impact was categorized as de-escalation of therapy (n=1), earlier diagnosis than
conventional methods and initiation of appropriate therapy (n=2), new diagnosis not made
by conventional methods and escalation of therapy (n=1), and new diagnosis and deescalation (n=2). The 3 new diagnoses made by Karius test included presumptive
diagnosis of an abdominal aorta mycotic aneurysm, a diagnosis of Rhizopus oryzae
confirming disseminated mucormycosis, and identification of mixed oral flora in a case of
blood culture-negative endocarditis, facilitating de-escalation of therapy. The 3 cases
associated with negative clinical impact resulted in additional, unnecessary diagnostic
investigations (n=2), and unnecessary treatment (n=1).

A total of 25/82 (30.5%) tests underwent Karius testing with a pre-established
microbiological diagnosis, with relative proportions varying by institution from 0 to 40%.
The most common conventional diagnostic method establishing a microbiological
diagnosis in this group was blood culture (n=9), tissue bacterial culture (n=6) and viral
blood-based PCR (n=4). Of the 25 patients with a positive conventional diagnosis, 16
(64.0%) showed the same organism detected by the Karius test, with 7 of these showing
other organisms in addition to the one that was reproducibly detected. The remaining 9

cases where Karius did not reproduce the result from conventional microbiological testing
included bacteria (Streptococcus viridans (n=1), Mycobacterium haemophilum (n=1),
Mycobacterium chelonae (n=1), Mycobacterium bovis (n=1)), DNA virus (adenovirus
(n=1)), and fungi (Candida parapsilosis (n=1), Candida lusitaniae (n=1), Coccidioides
immitis/posadasii (n=1), Mucorales (n=1)).

A subset of 10 patients underwent repeat testing, for a total of 16 additional
repeated tests from UCLA (n=14), SHC (n=1) and CUMC (n=1). Review of the 16 repeat
tests revealed 1 case associated with a positive clinical impact, where the repeat Karius
test was performed 3 months after the initial one. This 2-year-old boy with a history of
heart transplant was tested by Karius test shortly after an episode of Stenotrophomonas
maltophilia bacteremia and positive respiratory cultures for the same organism. Karius
testing confirmed Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and did not identify any other organism
which prompted the team to de-escalate therapy.

Discussion
Metagenomic next-generation sequencing has stimulated much interest among
providers across medical subspecialties given its potential for broad-range pathogen
detection. Furthermore, the noninvasive nature of plasma samples makes mNGS an
attractive diagnostic modality for deep-seated infections that currently require invasive
biopsy. However, the value of mNGS testing as a diagnostic tool is poorly understood. In
this multicenter retrospective cohort study, we show that, as currently used in clinical
practice, the real-world clinical impact of the Karius test is limited given that it resulted in

no or negative impact in the majority (92.7%) of patients. This finding was consistent with
that reported for mNGS on CSF where 196 of 204 (96.1%) tests did not have a clinical
impact [8]. As it currently stands, in most academic and private health systems,
microbiology and virology diagnostic laboratories offer a comprehensive menu of culturebased and molecular tests such that only few, typically complex, cases with infectious
etiology will be left without a diagnosis. Important questions to consider now are whether
mNGS has the diagnostic accuracy required to complement currently-available
diagnostics, and how best to integrate mNGS into current testing algorithms. Published
studies indicate CSF and plasma mNGS assays lack sensitivity compared to conventional
methods and therefore cannot be used as stand-alone or rule-out tests [2, 8]. Thus,
options include reserving mNGS as last resort for cases for which conventional
microbiological testing has failed to provide an answer, or in some cases to consider more
proximal testing in parallel to conventional tests. The decision to include mNGS testing
should take into account the differential diagnosis, as well as the availability and accuracy
of conventional methods. The specific example of lack of clinical impact of positive Karius
results for DNA viruses in this cohort provides a compelling case for routine highlyavailable, highly-accurate molecular virology assays providing sufficient and actionable
diagnostic information prior to Karius testing.

Plasma cell-free DNA may originate from the site of infection or colonization.
Although Karius reports quantitative units, there is no threshold that distinguishes
colonization from infection, and interpretation of results may therefore be clinically
challenging, especially in immunocompromised hosts and patients with disrupted

intestinal barrier. Clinical validation data recently reported on the Karius test from patients
presenting to the emergency department at a tertiary hospital with suspected sepsis have
demonstrated a positive percent agreement of 84.8% and negative percent agreement of
48.2% compared to all microbiological reference testing [2]. The finding that only 6 of 65
(9.2%) positive test results were positively impactful in the current study is consistent with
an assay specificity that is insufficient to enable clinical impact when organisms are
detected under routine practice. Even in certain cases where care was tailored to the
positive Karius result, it is unclear if the reported organisms were the underlying drivers
of pathology. For example, the patient with abdominal aorta mycotic aneurysm (Table 3;
Study ID SHC-11) in whom antibiotic therapy was de-escalated to chronic suppressive
therapy with amoxicillin-clavulanic acid based on a positive Karius result with
Enterococcus faecalis and Prevotella melaninogenica presented with multiple clinical
recurrences of back pain and eventually grew Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) from
a vertebral tissue biopsy 9 months later.

Patient selection practices may also have contributed to low clinical impact as
almost one-third (ranging from 0 to 40% by institution) of patients had already received a
microbiological diagnosis prior to testing. The only case in this cohort to have
demonstrated clinical impact in the setting of a pre-established microbiological diagnosis
is that of the repeat Karius test identifying Stenotrophomonas maltophilia only in a patient
with known bacteremia with the same organism, leading to de-escalation of therapy. This
highlights the important role of diagnostic stewardship in optimizing testing algorithms and
preventing unnecessary testing. In situations where positive conventional test results

precede the mNGS result, patient management (i.e., escalation or de-escalation of
therapy) should be considered based on conventional microbiological diagnostics rather
than waiting for confirmatory mNGS result.

The finding that 6/82 (7.3%) of Karius test results in this study led to positive clinical
impact is in contrast to that recently reported in a single pediatric center in Chicago where
56/100 (56.0%) test results were considered clinically actionable [9]. This discrepancy
may have been driven by differences in patient selection, in addition to differences in
outcome assessment methodology. For instance, in our study, clinical impact was solely
based on the treating team’s interpretation of Karius results and their subsequent
management decisions; in contrast, in the above study, clinical adjudication was
performed where ‘clinical relevance’ was unclear from the medical record. Inherent interprovider interpretation differences of whether Karius results represent a clinically
significant pathogen or colonization also likely contributed to findings. Other differences
between studies included variability in testing indication, proportion of ordering infectious
diseases providers, and proportion of patients with a known microbiological diagnosis
pre-Karius testing. The low clinical impact proportion in the present study was closer to
that reported for mNGS on CSF where 8/204 (3.9%) of tests led to positive clinical impact
[8].

This study was strengthened by its multicenter design including 5 adult and
pediatric sites, and by its assessment of real-world practice in presenting data from
provider-initiated testing. However, there are limitations. Firstly, although we made

significant effort to standardize the definition and application of clinical impact criteria,
some of the cases included were very complex medically and interpretation of clinical
impact may have been challenging to ascertain. The definition of impact was based on
how providing physicians interpreted and reacted to test results. This may have over or
underestimated the real impact of the Karius test result. Further studies with more
comprehensive and objective measures of impact (for example, including antibiotic use,
hospital length-of-stay, laboratory testing utilization) are needed to accurately quantify
clinical impact. Secondly, approval criteria for send-out testing varied by institution and
time period such that patient populations may have varied in their pre-test probability
which may have influenced the assessment of clinical impact. Finally, given this was a
convenience sample, not all patient populations are represented equally. For example,
only one HIV-1-positive individual was included, which limits generalizability to this patient
population.

In conclusion, plasma mNGS represents an attractive diagnostic modality due to
its noninvasive nature and potential to provide an early and actionable diagnosis.
However, this study has shown that the real-world impact of the Karius test as currently
used in clinical practice is limited given that this testing resulted in no or negative impact
in the majority (92.7%) of patients. Further studies are needed to better understand which
patient populations may potentially benefit, define the complementary role of mNGS to
conventional microbiological methods, and improve diagnostic interpretation algorithms.
Furthermore, institutions should adopt an active diagnostic stewardship role to ensure
optimal use of mNGS.
