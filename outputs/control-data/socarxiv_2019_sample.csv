As far as pragmatics is concerned, it means an important means of communication within a context, and it is a culture dependent. As for silence in literature, it offers the example in which silence is not only present and comprehended but also a substantial part of communication that encapsulate a sender and a receiver. In novels, it is considered as a new humanistic tactic through which a writer would force the reader to feel words rather than reading them plus more intensity and strength. Novelists tend to use silence in writing their novels as it is an integral part of voices and a revelation of so many hidden things, but it mistakenly might be understood as a refusal for communication. Finally, the notion of ‘silence’ in poetry offers the readers many examples where the poet invites the readers to hear ""silence.""

Family Background and Academic Performance in Germany, Norway, and the United States","Research on educational mobility usually fails to consider variation in the association between social origin and academic performance across the distribution of children’s academic performance. However, theories of social mobility as well as theories about resource allocation within families predict such variation. We use quantile regression models to estimate variations in the associations between different indicators of family background (parental education, occupation, earnings, and wealth) and children’s educational performance across the performance distribution. We apply this approach to data on Germany, Norway, and the United States, three countries that represent different kinds of welfare and education regimes that may affect the intergenerational transmission of educational advantage. We find a stronger association between family background and academic performance at the bottom than in the middle and the weakest association at the top of the performance distribution. These findings are virtually identical across all four indicators of family background.

This is particularly true in science museums, and researchers have pointed to awe as an epistemic emotion that can promote science learning. We present two studies of awe in a science museum. The first study (n = 293) examined how awe—conceptualized as a multifaceted construct associated with positive feelings of liberation/connection, negative feelings of oppression/isolation, chills, and diminished-self perceptions—differed across museum locations and in relation to prior knowledge. The second study (n = 708) expanded the investigation to also examine the relationship between awe and critical thinking. Across both studies, we found that, relative to baseline spaces, vast, beautiful spaces elicited positive awe-related emotions (amazement, curiosity) and stronger awe correlates (chills, diminished-self perceptions); vast, threatening spaces also elicited stronger amazement, chills, and diminished-self perceptions—but also stronger oppression/isolation. In both studies, pre-visit knowledge was associated with awe experiences during the visit. In Study 2, we also found evidence for relationships between awe and skepticism and aesthetic thought, two aspects of critical thinking: Positive aspects of awe (liberation/connection, curiosity) were associated with more skepticism, and negative aspects of awe (oppression/isolation, disorientation) with less skepticism. In terms of aesthetic thinking, diminished-self perceptions were associated being able describe observed roles and actions, and chills were associated with being able to describe personal opinions.

It is expected that the patterns of household resilience factors and adaptation practices have a strong linkage with household food security. The aim of this study was to seek an effective technique of adaptation for food security and the required types of support for adaptation to food insecurity among the poor and low income households in Malaysia.
Design/methodology/approach: This study was based on primary data that were collected in Jul-Oct 2012 through a questionnaire survey among 460 poor and low income households from the Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu states of Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database based on a two-stage cluster random sampling technique. The study considered household food security as household food availability and food accessibility, and ran ordinal regressions to find out the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security.
Findings: The study concludes that several resilience factors and adaptation practices were statistically significant to household food security, and several external supports were statistically and significantly needed to ensure household food security. Therefore, to ensure sustainable household food security in Malaysia, the food security programs needs to be integrated with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climatic changes adaptation programs, and the involvement of relevant stakeholders are crucial.
Originality/value: This study is a pioneer work based on primary data that empirically measured the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security in Malaysia. This study also discussed some issues related to the climate change linkage, which would help future climate change research. The findings of the study will be beneficial for all the stakeholders, including policy makers related to the food security and climate change adaptation.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-06-14T09:57:51.836912,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkbwn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkbwn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkbwn/citation/,hkbwn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkbwn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkbwn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9ngtd/,9ngtd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkbwn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0226ca35988f001ade3f1e/,5d0226ca35988f001ade3f1e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkbwn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkbwn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hkbwn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hkbwn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hkbwn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous research on the connection between high unemployment and media discourse has often relied on case studies of periods when stigmatising rhetoric about the poor was increasing. We build on earlier work on how economic context affects media representations of poverty by creating a unique dataset that measures how often stigmatising descriptions of the poor are used in five centrist and right-wing British newspapers between 1896 and 2000. Our results suggest stigmatising rhetoric about the poor increases when unemployment rises, except at the peak of very deep recessions (e.g. the 1930s and 1980s). This pattern is consistent with the idea that newspapers deploy deeply embedded Malthusian explanations for poverty when those ideas resonate with the economic context, and so this stigmatising rhetoric of recessions is likely to recur during future economic crises.",TRUE,FALSE,media|poverty|recession,2019-04-09T19:22:27.684619,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-09,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/citation/,kn9z7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/atse3/,atse3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cace0ace3915600165d2a6e/,5cace0ace3915600165d2a6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kn9z7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kn9z7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kn9z7,https://doi.org/10.1177/0038038519838752,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In legal translation which is a special and specialized area of translational activity (Cao, 2007), and where documents are characterized by brevity, economy, and neatness to prevent fraud, additions, omissions or alterations in the text (Crystal &amp; Davy, 1969), mistakes or mistranslations can lead to disastrous repercussions. The present study deals primarily with the methods that translators of legal texts follow and adopt when rendering a legal document. A concise account of translation theories that have been adopted and are still being applied to legal translation is offered to attempt to show the main views towards the application of such translation theories to legal translation. Major methods often used in the translation of legal documents are then presented, discussing their validity to legal translation. This presentation includes literal translation, free translation, the functional approach to translation, transliteration &amp; transcription, loan translation, adaptation, description by definitions, lexical expansion, and descriptive substitution.

attention focused on assessing levels of racial segregation at the spatial scale of a metropolitan area. In this paper, we present an analysis of 1990-2010 changes to racial diversity and segregation on a much smaller spatial scale of an urban census tract. To access time-standardized racial information at the tract and at the census block scales we use multiyear compatible high-resolution population grids. Indices of racial diversity and segregation are calculated for over 30,000 tracts pooled from 41 metropolitan areas. Statistical analysis of this dataset reveals that during the 1990-2010 period urban tracts increased their diversity in line with diversity increases of entire metro areas, but unlike metros, they also increased their levels of segregation. We hypothesize that an increased tendency for the residences of people of the same race to spatially aggregate on the tract scale is the result of individuals exercising preferences regarding their neighbors in reaction to the nationwide increase in diversity of the American population. The study also re-derives diversity and segregation indices from the first principles of the information theory, highlights the need to think about the issue of racial diversity/segregation in terms of spatial patterns, and uses one-person-per-dot maps to connect diversity/segregation indices to actual racial patterns.",TRUE,FALSE,information theory|Racial diversity|segregation|visualization,2019-05-03T14:28:09.825212,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-03,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Tomasz F.

In this way, both the development on ‘smart’ technology itself and its criticisms are the latest chapter in a long-standing disciplinary debate around quantification and technology. We re-evaluate this history and argue that quantitative methodology and its theoretical critiques are not as incompatible as often claimed.

To illustrate how we might address this apparent tension between theory and quantitative methods we review how both approaches conceptualize one of Geography’s core concepts: space, and highlight opportunities for symbiosis. Although smart technologies can further orthodox positivist approaches, we argue that the actual practice is more nuanced and not necessarily absolute or totalizing. For example, recent computational work builds upon critical geographic theories to analyze and visualize topological and relational spaces, relevant to topics such as gentrification and segregation. The result is not a Geography in which smart technology and algorithms remove the need for human input but rather a rejoinder in line with the recent resurgence of a critical quantitative geography. In short, a Geography where social theory and the human intellect play a key role in guiding computational approaches to analyze the largest, most versatile and relevant datasets on social space that we have ever had.",TRUE,FALSE,geocomputation|GIScience|smart technology|space|spatial science,2019-11-11T20:52:02.557514,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/citation/,u2w6n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc98288ee9bb9000d4ccc10/,5dc98288ee9bb9000d4ccc10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u2w6n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u2w6n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u2w6n,https://doi.org/10.1080/24694452.2019.1674630,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study attempts to answer these two questions: what is the pragmatic function of the information tone types that are employed in Obama’s speech concerning the termination component? and what are the pragmatic function of the proclaiming and referring tones that are employed in Obama’s speech concerning the dominance and non-dominance factor?. It aims to investigate the types of information tones in Obama’s speech concerning the termination component and dominance/non-dominance factor based on Brazil’s model (1997) of discourse intonation. This study confines itself to the American political interview and it is a qualitative study. The findings show that all the information tone types (proclaiming, referring, and level) are used in Obama’s speech and the high termination is most common level, which is used by Obama in his speech in order to emphasize the information and capture the attention of the interviewer. Generally, it was found that the dominance factor was higher than the non-dominance factor, which reflects that Obama took his status as the controller of the discourse during his speech with the interviewer and most of his speech carries contrastive information, which contradicts the interview’s expectation.

It is based upon a textual reading and analysis of two texts as representatives of colonial literature written about British-India and French-Algeria, namely A Passage to India by E.M. Forster and La Cina by Louis Bertrand. Relying on Albert Memmi’s foundational postcolonial theory developed in his The Colonizer and the Colonized, we assume that both texts obey and reflect a similar ideological discourse. The narratives are revealed to operate through a complex system which tends to (re)fashion and to (re)mold the identity of both the colonizer and the colonized. We demonstrate that Forster and Bertrand shape the main characters into two types which Memmi labels as: ‘the Colonizer who Accepts’ and ‘the Colonizer who Refuses’. We have also showed that the writers though belonging to different imperial powers and writing in two different languages, they could not but adhere and support the colonial practices of their countries.  What comes also of this study is that Forster, though most often known for his Liberalism, vehicles a racial discourse which accounts for the superiority of the British colonizer. Bertrand is much more racist and jingoist, his attitudes are reminders of what Achebe said about Conrad; ‘a bloody racist’.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-06-04T11:30:50.198906,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/citation/,x692h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5e9994df3460019bda290/,5cf5e9994df3460019bda290,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x692h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x692h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x692h,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While sociological theories would predict  inequality to increase following the passage of Right to Work laws, previous research has found these laws to be largely inconsequential for economic inequality. Drawing on power resources theory, I reassess the consequences of Right to Work laws and allow their impact to depend upon local union membership. To do so, I construct unique datasets at the state and commuting zone levels of income and wage inequality, merging data from the Internal Revenue Service, the US census, the American Community Survey, the US Union Sourcebook, the Current Population Survey, and the National Labor Relations Board for years 1939 to 2016. After using two-way fixed effects and instrumental variable regression models to replicate inconsistent results of previous studies, I show that these mask substantial and robust heterogeneity across local areas. Simply put, Right to Work laws are highly consequential when passed in times and places where labor has something to lose. Right to Work laws remove the negative association between labor union membership and inequality, while the consequences of Right to Work passage are greatest in highly unionized areas. In total, results suggest that Right to Work laws work as intended, increasing economic inequality indirectly  by lowering labor power resources.

This is not a challenge that can be tackled everywhere in the same way. It is thus vital to ground the pursuit of the SDGs in locally prevalent worldviews and reflect specific contexts in developing  coherent  pathways.  In  addressing  the  need  to  couple  global  concerns  with  local aspirations and conditions, this paper introduces a stakeholder-based approach for visioning and exploring sustainable development pathways to meet the SDGs, inclusive to marginalized voices and facilitating a context-sensitive exploration of alternative futures. The approach departs from the Three horizons framework, a participatory approach developed for groups to think about transformative change. We present the benefits and challenges of the adapted approach in relation to an illustrative case study, the 2018 African Dialogue on The World In 2050, deliberating future pathways for agriculture and food systems in Africa. The key contribution of the paper is twofold. First, we detail the premises and steps of the Three Horizons for the SDGs (3H4SDG) approach. Second, we summarize the results of a pilot application of the approach -four alternative pathways for how food systems and agriculture can contribute to meeting the SDGs in Sub-Saharan Africa, integrated with the worldviews entangled in the narratives of the participating stakeholders. We conclude that participatory approaches grounded in systems thinking represent a promising way to link local aspirations with global goals.",TRUE,FALSE,2030 Agenda|imagination|planetary boundaries|scenarios|SDGs|Three horizons|transformation|TWI2050,2019-02-22T21:02:01.754951,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/citation/,uhskb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7019748d5d98001a353494/,5c7019748d5d98001a353494,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uhskb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uhskb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uhskb,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A variety of professional development strategies have been introduced to teachers of English and have been put into practice. Action research is one of these strategies. It is introduced to teachers through a voluntary course, Research for Professional Development (RPD), which is a sixteen-session course and lasts for one semester. This course aims to raise teachers' knowledge and skills of action research in order to support them, as research practitioners, to enhance the quality of their work and to show initiatives in their schools. However, as it is relatively new in this context, this study attempted to explore teachers' beliefs on the values of this course with regard to their professional development and the extent to which these teachers adopted this strategy for their ongoing professional development after the course. The study was conducted in the Dakhiliya region of Oman and the data was collected from eight teachers through a semi-structured interview. The findings indicate a conception of the RPD course as a means to enrich Omani teachers' knowledge and skills of AR. The practical side of the course also raises participants' awareness of the possibilities of improving their work and gives them insights to solving their students' problems through systematic inquiries. This study also reveals that, although participants master this tool, very few of them conduct action research after the course and this is due to the lack of time, heavy responsibilities and lack of support. Therefore, this study raises the issue that although providing teachers with knowledge and skills of PD strategies is essential, enabling them to apply these strategies relies heavily on paying attention to their needs.",TRUE,FALSE,Action research|research for professional development course|teachers’ professional development,2019-09-11T12:49:46.891957,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/citation/,4gynu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d77e395af02530019a62d1e/,5d77e395af02530019a62d1e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4gynu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4gynu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4gynu,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.237,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Religion scholars have argued that religion is multi-faceted and hence better understood by focusing on combinations of indicators (i.e. mosaics), versus a more traditional variable-centered approach. We adopt this framework and investigate the interplay between religion and peer networks, both in how religious mosaics are shaped by friends and how profiles affect friend selection dynamics. With data from two schools in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, we estimate these religious mosaics using latent class analysis (LCA) to identify profiles consisting of combinations of commonly available survey-based measures of religious attitudes, behaviors and identities. Finding evidence of theoretically-expected profiles, our second step is to use stochastic actor based models (SABMs) to investigate network dynamics for these LCA-based religious profiles. We demonstrate how the distinct structure of profile data can be integrated within the SABM framework to evaluate processes of friend selection and influence. Results show evidence of adolescents influencing one another’s religious mosaics, but not selecting friends on that basis.",TRUE,FALSE,Add Health|adolescents|latent class analysis|religion|social networks|stochastic actor-based models,2019-04-05T11:10:47.544479,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-05,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/citation/,dc5gh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ca60b5824df750017c7131e/,5ca60b5824df750017c7131e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dc5gh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dc5gh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dc5gh,https://doi.org/10.1111/jssr.12638,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When used to visualize rates or similar, these plots usually do not convey information about population size. The failure to communicate population size in Lexis surfaces can lead to misinterpretations of the mortality conditions populations face because, for example, high mortality rates at very high ages have historically been experienced by only a small proportion of a population or cohort. We propose enhanced Lexis surfaces that include a visual representation of  population size. The examples we present demonstrate how such plots can give readers a more intuitive understanding of the demographic development of a population over time. Visualizations are implemented using an R-Shiny application, building upon perception theories. We present example plots for enhanced Lexis surfaces that show trends in cohort mortality and first-order differences in cohort mortality developments. These plots illustrate how adding the cohort size dimension allows us to extend the analytical potential of standard Lexis surfaces. Our enhanced Lexis surfaces improve conventional depictions of period, age, and cohort trends in demographic developments of populations and cohorts. An online interactive visualization tool based on Human Mortality Database data allows users to generate and export enhanced Lexis surfaces for their research.

However, language mapping and geographic information system (GIS) data creation has not kept pace with this demand. To date, language range information is typically contained in small, private regional datasets, paper maps and published illustrations, or in a very small number of global digital datasets. Each of these sources has advantages and disadvantages, and though these considerations may not be apparent to all data users, they can have significant impacts on research results. Mapping of language ranges is a particularly complex problem in regions where colonial histories have had dramatic effects on language diversity, language locations, and the relative representation of colonial and indigenous perspectives. Here we consider how the creation of digital language range data can better meet the needs of researchers interested in language diversity, discuss how better standards for data quality and transparency can be implemented for digital language range maps, and present a map of North American language ranges that has resulted from the use of these procedures and standards.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-09-04T02:53:46.091253,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/citation/,9fu7g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6e2afc7215100019a0fccd/,5d6e2afc7215100019a0fccd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9fu7g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9fu7g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9fu7g,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Data were collected by interviewing children in their homes. Children chose eight toys from a tailored catalog and explained why they wanted those particular items. Toys were analyzed with the aid of a framework designed to test their functional manipulation potential. The children's reasoning was analyzed by means of inductive content analysis. Two kinds of values were found: (1) those which reside in the toy itself and (2) those which children give to toys.

Using high-quality register data on the wealth of parents during the year of partnering, we show that the correlation between partners’ levels of parental wealth is considerably lower compared to estimates from earlier research on other countries. Nonetheless, parental wealth homogamy is high at the very top of the parental wealth distribution, and individuals from wealthy families are relatively unlikely to partner with individuals from families with low wealth. Parental wealth correlations among partners are higher when looking only at parental assets rather than net wealth, implying that the former might be a better measure for studying many social stratification processes. Most specifications indicate that homogamy increased in the 2000s relative to the 1990s, but trends can vary depending on methodological choices. The increasing levels of parental wealth homogamy raise concerns that, over time, partnering behavior has become more consequential for wealth inequality between couples.",TRUE,FALSE,Assortative Mating|Cohabitation|Homogamy|Inequality|Intergenerational Processes|Marriage|Social Stratification|Wealth,2019-03-28T14:34:22.632795,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Income Distribution|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/citation/,w4bzx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9bdd51aae20b0017b0f7b2/,5c9bdd51aae20b0017b0f7b2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w4bzx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w4bzx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w4bzx,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Drawing on three months of ethnographic data collection, I find that working-class male youth intellectualize pro-gay attitudes and that homophobic language is almost entirely absent from the setting.

Informed by conversation analysis (CA) approach, this study aims to identify the opening sequences and ritual expressions of informal mobile phone conversations among Saudi friends and relatives. Another goal is that to identify whether the opening sequences of mobile phone are similar or different from the landline telephone. The study will answer the following questions: what are the opening sequences and ritual expressions of mobile phone? And what are the similarities and differences between mobile phone and landline telephone in terms of the opening sequences. Thirty audio-recorded and transcribed mobile phone conversations served as the data source for this study. Data were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by using the CA approach. Findings showed that the majority of opening sequences of mobile phone calls were reduced to three sequences: summons answer, greeting exchanges, and how-are-you exchanges due the impact of caller ID. In addition, the sequence of identification/recognition can be found when the caller does not know the callee or the number is silent.  Therefore, mobile phone and landline telephone have similarities and differences in the opening sequences in general. However, the differences observed can be a reason of the cultural practices for language use more than the effect of medium used in communication such as landline telephone and mobile phone in Saudi Arabic. Finally, more data are needed to investigate gender differences.",TRUE,FALSE,Conversation analysis|mobile phone calls|opening sequences|ritual expressions|Saudi Arabic,2019-08-04T20:54:49.199012,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvdju/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvdju/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvdju/citation/,gvdju,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvdju/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvdju/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvdju/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d473c17bcd6d900198fe012/,5d473c17bcd6d900198fe012,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvdju/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvdju/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gvdju/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gvdju/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gvdju,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

What began as peaceful protests in March 2011 erupted into violent, brutal attacks, all culminating into the bloodiest conflict in the 21st century, which saw intervention by many State and non-State actors like Al-Qaeda, Al-Nusra Front and the like. The involvement of foreign powers led by the US and its allies in Europe and West Asia exacerbated the situation, when they started arming, funding and training rebels and/or terrorist groups. The other prominent actors like Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia supported the rebels and/or terrorist groups, while the Syrian forces were supported by Iran, Iraq and Lebanon-based militia group, Hezbollah, and lately by the Kurdish groups.

An emerging research field, using the latest global socioeconomic and climate scenarios – namely the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) and Representative Concentration (RCPs) – is exploring how different socioeconomic pathways will influence future society’s ability to cope with climate change impacts. While the SSPs have been extensively used at the global scale, their use at the local and urban scale has remained rare, as they first need to be contextualized and extended for the particular place of interest. In this study, we present and apply a method to develop multi-scale extended SSPs at the city and neighborhood scale. Using Boston, Massachusetts, as a case study, we combined scenario matching, experts’ elicitation, and participatory processes to contextualize and make the global SSPs relevant at the urban scale. We subsequently employed the extended SSPs to explore future neighborhood-level vulnerability to extreme heat under multiple plausible socioeconomic trajectories, highlighting the usefulness of extended SSPs in informing future vulnerability assessments.

To explore the discourse on digital education, this paper draws on discourse analysis of ethnographic interviews with for-profit and non-profit organizations in the field. It asks (i) what industry insiders describe as driving change in contemporary educational technology (edtech), and (ii) whether new actors/technologies are shaping a novel educational hegemony, and if so, what this hegemony looks like. This paper presents initial findings from an ongoing project. It observes a shift in who/what drives change: The teacher used to be seen as key. Today, three different drivers are named: (1) learners (individual dimension), (2) schools (systemic dimension), (3) data (analytics dimension). Overall, the paper suggests that power and politics are not at all erased from the edtech industry’s accounts of digital technologies.

We present survey evidence documenting LPG ownership and cooking fuel use in rural north India. LPG ownership has increased rapidly, substantially driven by the Ujjwala Yojana. Three-quarters of rural households in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh now have LPG. Almost all of these households also have a stove that uses solid fuels, and among those owning both, almost three-quarters used solid fuels the day before the survey. Household economic status, relative costs of cooking fuels, gender inequality, and beliefs regarding the ease, food taste, and health impacts of cooking with solid fuels versus LPG are important contributors to high solid fuel use despite LPG ownership.

During the pilot study, the researcher analyzed fifty translated passages from students' assignments. The aim of this systematic analysis was necessary to build a list of their most frequent errors. Besides, a checklist was used to determine students’ level of awareness of these errors. As a result, a program based on some metacognitive strategies was developed to raise students’ awareness of syntactic and semantic errors to improve their translation performance. Metacognition awareness went through five stages of preparation, presentation, practice, evaluation, and expansion. Students worked together in the process of translation to translate the given passages. They worked in pairs to proofread their translation by identifying their errors, correcting them, and finally editing their final copy. A pre-post translation test was developed to assess students’ translation performance. Data obtained from the test was dealt statistically with SPSS software. The results indicated improvement in students' translation performance.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-07-21T21:22:23.330112,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d83xs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d83xs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d83xs/citation/,d83xs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d83xs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d83xs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d83xs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2be35da26b3400160cf1d1/,5d2be35da26b3400160cf1d1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d83xs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d83xs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d83xs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d83xs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d83xs,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The connectionist theory of cognition suggests that individuals have mental models composed of associations between concepts. Moreover, structuralist perspectives consider beliefs form an interrelated system. Therefore, the estimation of causal effects of beliefs is undermined by these interdependent relationships of beliefs. This article introduces factorial surveys (FS) as a useful method to solve these potential problems. To demonstrate the appropriateness of this method, this study presents a design and application of FS to a representative sample of Chileans and their beliefs about what determines happiness. The findings provide a folk theory (or a lay theory) of happiness determinants, where health is the most important determinant of happiness, followed by income and lifestyles. In addition, the reliability and cognitive bias of FSs are addressed, finding support for their applicability in developing countries. A potential reduction of social desirability bias in FSs is discussed in the conclusions.",TRUE,FALSE,endogeneity|Factorial survey|folk theory|happiness beliefs,2019-04-11T17:08:10.966077,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/citation/,sn8q9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7dnbe/,7dnbe,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caed9e7353c58001997a90c/,5caed9e7353c58001997a90c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/sn8q9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/sn8q9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/sn8q9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

presumed Western cultural attack on Russian tradition and sovereignty. The primary target is
an ongoing legal implementation of the UN Convention of the Rights of the Child, which is
conceived of as a Western feint contrived by hostile global agencies and a Russian fifth
column of treacherous NGOs and state administrators.
This article elucidates how the Parents' Movement navigates between seemingly
incompatible ideals to construct itself as an authentic “voice of the people. The notion of civil
society is vital in this pursuit, although Western conceptions of liberal democracy are rejected
in favor of President Putin’s vision of a patriotic civil society loyal to common national goals.
The movement is harshly critical to many government policies, however, and rejects the state
administration as well as other elites as corrupt and morally polluting. At the same time, it has
to negotiate the fact that attempts to influence the despised political elite also imply the risk of
becoming usurped by it.
Since the movement’s campaigns to a large extent take place on-line, this study is based
on Internet sources as well as interviews with activists. Exploring how concepts such as civil
society and civic activism are translated and operationalized into the contemporary Russian
sociopolitical context, it contributes to the understanding of contemporary popular

I argue that economically driven cross-border mobility generates reciprocal political economy effects on sending and host states. That is, it produces migration interdependence. Host states may leverage their position against a sending state by either deploying strategies of restriction—curbing remittances, strengthening immigration controls, or both—or displacement—forcefully expelling citizens of the sending state. These strategies’ success depends on whether the sending state is vulnerable to the political economy costs incurred by host states’ strategy, namely if it is unable to absorb them domestically and cannot procure the support of alternative host states. I also contend that displacement strategies involve higher costs than restriction efforts and are therefore more likely to succeed. I demonstrate my claims through a least-likely, two-case study design of Libyan and Jordanian coercive migration diplomacy against Egypt in the aftermath of the Arab Spring.

Despite what scholars and journalists consider a worrying trend, there is no evidence of growing popular concern about inequality. In fact, research suggests that citizens in unequal societies are less concerned than those in more egalitarian societies. How to make sense of this paradox? I argue that citizens’ consent to inequality is explained by their growing conviction that societal success is reflective of a meritocratic process. Drawing on 25-years of International Social Survey Programme data, I show that rising inequality is legitimated by the popular belief that the income gap is meritocratically deserved: the more unequal a society, the more likely its citizens are to explain success in meritocratic terms, and the less important they deem non-meritocratic factors such as a person’s family wealth and connections.",TRUE,FALSE,beliefs|income|inequality|ISSP|longitudinal|meritocracy|political attitudes|theory|trend,2019-01-17T14:32:21.635756,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Theory and Philosophy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Political Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/citation/,dcr9b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n6p3w/,n6p3w,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c405f3fe8da0e0019599fc8/,5c405f3fe8da0e0019599fc8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dcr9b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dcr9b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dcr9b,https://doi.org/10.1093/ser/mwy051,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study highlights the erroneous strategies adopted by the translators of these literary works and suggests more suitable alternative translations. As a result of several mismatches between Arabic and English leads to such errors.

This article describes the design and development of identification of students' misconceptions in an individualized learning environment (iSMILE) system that includes accommodations for students’ misconceptions in order to improve student’s conceptual understanding and finally learning outcome. The assessment process is carried out by preparing two-level multiple-choice questions. Misconceptions are identified for each instructional objective to make a root question and linked questions. Depending on the answers provided by the student in first level, the linked questions are given to get more information regarding the misconception.

Yet, it is hard to evaluate the scope and effectiveness of political astroturfing without ""ground truth"" information, such as the verified identity of its agents and instigators. In this paper, we study the South Korean National Information Service's (NIS) disinformation campaign during the presidential election in 2012, taking advantage of a list of campaign accounts published in court proceedings. Features that best distinguish these accounts from regular users in contemporaneously collected Twitter data are traces left by coordination among astroturfing agents, instead of the individual account characteristics typically used in related approaches such as social bot detection. We develop a methodology that exploits these distinct empirical patterns to identify additional likely astroturfing accounts and validate this detection strategy by analyzing their messages and current account status. However, an analysis relying on Twitter influence metrics shows that the known and suspect NIS accounts only had a limited impact on political social media discussions. By using the principal-agent framework to analyze one of the earliest revealed instances of political astroturfing, we improve on extant methodological approaches to detect disinformation campaigns and ground them more firmly in social science theory.",TRUE,FALSE,Astroturfing|Disinformation|Election campaign|Propaganda|Social media,2019-07-31T12:21:23.411277,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-31,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/citation/,a5gk6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/tpa6u/,tpa6u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3f6a3f596eee001d653479/,5d3f6a3f596eee001d653479,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a5gk6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a5gk6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a5gk6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In contrast to previous studies, the model relies on the probability distribution of a default jump rather than the default jump itself, as the default jump is usually inaccessible. As such, the model can back out the market prices of convertible bonds. A prevailing belief in the market is that convertible arbitrage is mainly due to convertible underpricing. Empirically, however, we do not find evidence supporting the underpricing hypothesis. Instead, we find that convertibles have relatively large positive gammas. As a typical convertible arbitrage strategy employs delta-neutral hedging, a large positive gamma can make the portfolio highly profitable, especially for a large movement in the underlying stock price.",TRUE,FALSE,convertible arbitrage|convertible bond|convertible underpricing|default probability approach|default time approach|hybrid financial instrument|jump diffusion,2019-10-01T02:47:25.746407,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/citation/,gxwaj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d911522d55120001b5c6d28/,5d911522d55120001b5c6d28,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxwaj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gxwaj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gxwaj,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There are several ways in which governments can create fiscal space to finance social protection programmes (e.g. social pensions). The idea is to create new sources of revenue –sustainable in the long-run – which can be used to finance social pensions, without building new liabilities and without distorting macroeconomic stability. The literature specifically addressing the potential fiscal space that could be created to finance social pensions is limited. This paper aims to begin filling some of those gaps and identify sources for creating fiscal space for social pensions through the revenue side (i.e. examine the revenue-generating potential of taxation for social pensions). Specifically, examine the potential funding power of three types of taxes (income tax, corporate tax, and trade tax) using cross-country tax revenues and tax rate data in a global perspective. The paper demonstrates that the three taxes have a revenue-generating potential to finance social pensions in several countries. There is not a magic prescription useful for every country, but there are numerous options to design a tailored mix of sources to create fiscal space. *This study was funded by Help Age International, while the author was a Research Fellow.",TRUE,FALSE,ageing|aging|cash transfer|fiscal space|latin america|LMICs|older-age|pension|social pension|social spending|tax|welfare state,2019-02-02T04:38:00.901618,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-02,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/citation/,pgxmk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u687n/,u687n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c54d84de16f550018871e0b/,5c54d84de16f550018871e0b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pgxmk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pgxmk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pgxmk,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12126-017-9298-2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

These theoretical foundations enable the instructor to appropriately implement the outlined approach along its salient features to achieve the desired outcomes. Despite this tight rapport, teachers of English at the University of Mostaganem tend to rely on their common-sense teaching practices that are mainly informed by their experience of teaching EFL. The gap between the two extremes theory and practice, the premise of this paper, may be widened as teachers do not develop accurate and scientific understandings of certain pedagogical concepts, in this case, learner-centeredness as agreed on by professional academics, let alone to apply it along its proper standards. The pedagogical sequel of such misunderstanding mainly relate to random references to both teacher and learner-centered approaches in classroom teaching practices. The study via a detailed teachers’ questionnaire revealed that teachers of English, in addition to the cursory understandings they develop in relation to the very meaning of a learner-centered approach, tend to eschew developing learners’ metacognitive skills in their teaching practices.

Using data on lung obstruction from the WHO Survey of Global AGEing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE 2007-08), this paper studies the determinants of respiratory health in India, home to a third of all deaths from Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease. First, we find that smokers and members of households that use solid fuels (wood, biomass, coal or dung) for cooking have higher lung obstruction. Second, even if a respondent's household uses clean fuels, their lung obstruction is higher if their neighbors use solid fuels. In neighborhoods with high solid fuel use, the lungs of members of households that use clean fuels can be as obstructed as lungs of members of households that use solid fuels. These negative externalities of solid fuel use are robust to additional controls for neighborhood socioeconomic status, falsification tests, tests with placebo measures, and tests using alternative measures of respiratory health as outcomes. Third, the influence of the determinants is patterned by gender. Smoking tobacco is an important influence on lung obstruction among men.

cfyva,preprints,2019-05-23,2020-07-18,2019-05-23,NA,NA,The Women's Movement and Indonesia's Transition to Democracy,"Indonesia is an especially interesting case study for democratization and women’s empowerment because it is one of the few Muslim majority democracies and has a long history of women’s mobilization.  A vibrant and diverse Indonesian women’s movement arose in the 1990s and played an important role in the democracy movement. Since then, women’s rights activists have achieved some crucial reforms, but have also confronted unprecedented and complex challenges—notably, the rise of religious conservatism. This chapter examines how the Indonesian women’s rights movement has fared with the advent of democratization. While democratization in Indonesia has produced important gains for women’s rights, it has also empowered conservative activists who oppose much of the agenda of the women’s rights movement. Women’s rights activists have had difficulty responding to this challenge because of ideological divisions and lack of a mass base, and because the state has been increasingly willing to defer to conservative forces. In short, the key factors for the fate of women’s rights activism during Indonesia’s democratization have been the patterns of women’s mobilization, the strength of counter-movement mobilization, and political decentralization—all of which have been shaped by pre-transition political legacies. The experience of activists in Indonesia suggests that the recent literature on democratization and women’s rights would benefit from greater consideration of how and when democratization processes can empower illiberal actors, counter-movements, and/or backlash against women’s rights.",TRUE,FALSE,Democratization|Feminism|Gender|Indonesia|Islam|Muslim|Women|Women's Rights,2019-05-23T21:10:21.448177,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Rachel Rinaldo,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/citation/,cfyva,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ce709b035f2580017a88ade/,5ce709b035f2580017a88ade,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cfyva/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cfyva/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cfyva,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Contributing to this literature, this paper argues that more than important actors facilitating financialization, states can also (partially) exert control over, actively manage and shape financialization. In the context of China’s variegated financialization process, this paper analyzes the crucial role of securities exchanges in the development of China’s capital markets since the global financial crisis 2007–09. These state-owned exchanges act as intermediaries between the Chinese state, society and finance by shaping the infrastructural arrangements of capital markets. Thereby, they facilitate the authorities’ ability to control markets and direct their outcomes towards state policies. Financialization is thereby decoupled from a neoliberal policy paradigm, and rather than a break with China’s authoritarian capitalism, exchanges facilitate state control within and through financialization.",TRUE,FALSE,authoritarian capitalism|capital markets|China|financialization|market infrastructures|securities exchanges,2019-12-18T14:06:44.244065,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/citation/,kcp3g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df92f0d1abedf000aa84031/,5df92f0d1abedf000aa84031,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcp3g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kcp3g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kcp3g,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Immigration, Adolescent Language Aptitude and New Evidence on Books in the Home from Four European Countries","Evidence suggests that books in the childhood home impacts children’s educational and occupational attainments. Previous research finds this ‘book effect’ after conditioning on parental socio-economic status and national context. Human and cultural capital theories offer plausible explanations for this book effect. However, mechanisms underlying the book effect remain empirically illusory. Drawing on previous findings, we develop theoretical arguments that human and cultural capital are not the entire story behind the book effect. Designing a formal model of all these processes, we test our claims using immigration, language and country-context to adjudicate between mechanisms hypothesized by the theories. Using CILS4EU data in four countries and structural equation modeling to test these theories’ models against the data, we find the direct effect of books does not differ between native and immigrant adolescents in predicting 9th grade language aptitude scores. Moreover, this effect does not vary much by country. Reading habits and primary language spoken at home explain only part of the effect suggesting the presence of books measures something operating independently and in addition to human and cultural capital.

The role of feelings in the persistence of marriage as an institution,"Despite cohabitation becoming increasingly equivalent to marriage in some of the most ‘advanced’ Western European societies, the vast majority of people still marry. Why so? Existing theories, mostly based on various approaches tied to cognitive decision‐making, do not provide a sufficient explanation of the persistence of marriage. In this article, we argue that feelings attached to marriage, i.e. the affective evaluation of those involved in a partner relationship concerning marriage as opposed to cohabitation, explain the persistent importance of marriage as an institution.

We test whether this travels to a young middle-income democracy where women's rights are tenuous: South Africa. Contrary to prior work we find no discernible effect on attitudes about women's rights or partisan identification. Using a unique dataset of over 7,500 respondents and an equivalence testing approach, we reject the null hypothesis of any effects of 5 percentage points or greater at conventional levels of statistical significance. We speculate that our null findings relate to opportunity: daughter effects are more likely when parents perceive economic, social, and political opportunities for women. When women's customary status and de factor opportunities are low, as in South Africa, having a daughter may have no effect on parents' political behavior.

We are concerned about the design, analysis, reporting and reviewing of quantitative IS studies that draw on null hypothesis significance testing (NHST). We observe that debates about misinterpretations, abuse, and issues with NHST, while having persisted for about half a century, remain largely absent in IS. We find this an untenable position for a discipline with a proud quantitative tradition. We discuss traditional and emergent threats associated with the application of NHST and examine how they manifest in recent IS scholarship. To encourage the development of new standards for NHST in hypothetico-deductive IS research, we develop a balanced account of possible actions that are implementable short-term or long-term and that incentivize or penalize specific practices.

Ageing in the public eye can be distilled to a limited number of adverse events, such as loss of health, partnership and wealth. While these events are a constitutive part of “normal ageing”, they do not occur uniformly at the same time point in the life course. This study investigates to what extent bereavement, functional health loss and onset of poverty are adequate markers of ageing, and illustrates inequalities in their timing according to cohort, gender, class and ethnicity.
Methods
Data of the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), collected over 7 waves (2002-2016) (n=7913) are examined using survival analysis.
Results
Persistent associations of manual or routine occupational class and belonging to an ethnic minorities are found with increased hazards of health loss, bereavement and wealth loss. Later born cohorts have higher health loss hazards as well as lower hazards for wealth loss, while earlier born cohorts have lower hazards for bereavement. Gender effects are pronounced in terms of bereavement, limited in terms of health loss and absent in terms of wealth loss.

It is challenging to apply collaborative learning methods because students tend to engage passively with traditional methods of lectures. Several studies have suggested that digital interactive technologies such as Zuvio Interactive Response System (IRS) have been applied to increase learning motivation. However, related studies on using IRS in English a foreign language (EFL) classrooms are limited in Taiwan, especially from learners' perspectives. The aim of this study was to integrate an interactive response system into an English grammar course and to explore whether the assistance of this digital tool could promote students' learning motivation and whether it could facilitate a student learning environment. Based on the research background and rationale, the following research questions were investigated: (1) How does the use of the IRS influence students' perceptions toward their learning attitudes? (2) How does the use of the IRS influence students' perceptions toward learning contents? (3) How does the use of the IRS influence students' perceptions toward classroom interaction? An experimental design was employed. This research was conducted in this one-semester project to uncover 49 EFL learners’ views of IRS in a grammar class. Zuvio IRS and the British Council Grammar Snacks videos were utilized in this experimental instruction. A questionnaire was administered and consisted of demographic information, Likert scale questions, and open-ended short-answer questions. The results showed positive attitudes for learning with Zuvio IRS and videos, and the interactions between students and the teacher that mediated by Zuvio IRS. Future studies might explore learning outcomes of students from different majors, implement results of IRS studies into curriculum and instruction, and create more appropriate questions into IRS.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL in Taiwanese context|grammar videos|interaction|interactive response system|motivation,2019-08-04T21:00:51.345377,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/citation/,f6spw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d472aba3ce9350018f13206/,5d472aba3ce9350018f13206,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6spw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f6spw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6spw,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It requires teachers to employ suitable approaches and methodologies to ensure the effectiveness of the lesson. This serves as the main purpose of this study which is to discover the approaches employed by literature teachers. In addition, three significant dimensions will also be scrutinised which are locality, literature training and teaching experience. Utilizing questionnaire as the research instrument, this study involved 271 teachers as the respondents. Comparisons pertaining to the approaches employed based on locality, training and teaching experience were shown in the findings. To note, the majority of the respondents were found to be in favor of using simple terminologies as the most preferred approach. Meanwhile, the least favored approach was eliciting information from students. In addition, out of the three main variables, only teaching experience was found to show no significant difference.

A reflection of a qualitative research project-based seminar.,"Openness in science and education is increasing in importance within the digital knowledge society. So far, less attention has been paid to teaching Open Science in bachelor’s degrees or in qualitative methods. Therefore, the aim of this article is to use a seminar example to explore what Open Science practices can be taught in qualitative research and how digital tools can be involved. The seminar focused on the following practices: Open data practices, the practice of using the free and open source tool “Collaborative online Interpretation, the practice of participating, cooperating, collaborating and contributing through participatory technologies and in social (based) networks. To learn Open Science practices, the students were involved in a qualitative research project about “Use of digital technologies for the study and habitus of students”. The study shows the practices of Open Data are easy to teach, whereas the use of free and open source tools and participatory technologies for collaboration, participation, cooperation and contribution is more difficult.

One surprising paradox is a dramatic underrating of the hosts of main tournaments. The hosts, who are absent from the preliminaries, for a long time, play only friendlies that award few points. Three models estimate the magnitude of the resulting “Host Effect” at 14.1-16.7 positions. Such an estimate goes against the intuition that a large investment in hosting a tournament should result in the improvement of the host team’s standing.

Twelve of them are written by non-native Iraqi female students and the rest by native American female students. To do so, the researchers have set two aims: examining the types and subtypes of metadiscourse markers in terms of nativity and major and comparing the usages of metadiscourse markers’ types and subtypes in terms of nativity. To achieve the present aims, Hyland’s model (2005) is adopted. It aids in classifying the types and subtypes of metadiscourse markers in both data. The findings show that the Iraqi and American researchers use the interactive resources more than the interactional ones but the American researchers are capable of engaging their readers since their use of the interactional markers is higher than their counterparts. The field has no effect on the use of metadiscourse markers. There is diversity in the usage of the interactive resources in Iraqi data.

Using a unique dataset of separate evacuee and migration destinations, we compare and contrast the pre--, peri--, and post-migration systems of permanent migrants and temporary evacuees of the Great East Japan Earthquake and Tsunami. We construct and compare prefecture-to-prefecture migration matrices for Japanese prefectures to investigate the similarity of migration systems. We find evidence supporting the presence of two separate migration systems -- one for evacuees and one for more permanent migrants -- where evacuees seem to emphasize short distance migration while more permanent migrants emphasize migration to destinations with pre-existing ties. Additionally, our results show that permanent migration in the peri-- and post-periods is largely identical to the pre-existing migration system.

It can include many speech acts and can fit into various speech act categories. Thus, this study aims at (1) investigating the most common speech acts used – in order to issue   gossiping, (2) figuring out the most common types of presupposition of gossiping, and (3) identifying the functions of gossiping. To achieve these aims, it is hypothesized that: (1) stating and telling are the most common speech acts used in issuing gossiping, (2) factive presupposition is the most common type used in issuing gossiping, and (3) information, intimacy, and entertainment are the functions of gossiping. Then, to achieve the aims of the study and test its hypotheses, the following procedures are adopted: (1) presenting a theoretical background of gossiping, and (2) analyzing the data of the study according to a model developed by the study. The findings of such analysis come up with employing different kinds of speech acts in triggering the gossip, on the part of the gossiper, such as: telling (0.4%), stating (0.4%), and criticizing (0.2%). As for presupposition, it is the only strategy that is employed by the gossipers to trigger gossip in all of the ten excerpts. Depending on the analysis of the data of the study, the following conclusions are introduced: (1) Gossiping is an activity that is concerned with the affairs of a third party. (2) The speech acts of telling, stating, and criticizing are employed to trigger gossip.

Determining and understanding these identities is important because research shows that who a person believes themselves to be has implications for how they approach their healthcare, along with their emotional and physical wellbeing.
Design: We employed a qualitative narrative approach. We then used thematic narrative analysis to identify emergent identities across stories gathered from hearing aid users. These themes allowed us to assign emergent identities to the hearing-aid users.
Study Sample: Thirty adults with hearing loss who reported using their hearing aids during all waking hours.
Results: Five identities emerged from the hearing-aid users’ narratives: 1) the satisfied user, 2) the overcomer, 3) the dispassionate user, 4) the frustrated and resigned user, and 5) the griever.
Conclusions: These findings are a first step to improving theoretical and clinical insights into the perspectives and experiences of satisfied hearing-aid users following diagnosis of their hearing loss and their hearing aid fittings.

Although this macro-level trend is well-established in research literature, less is known about subnational patterns of income inequality in the U.S., particularly as they vary between and within rural and urban localities. Using Census and ACS data, this study produces Gini estimates of within-county income inequality and examines these trends across a six-strata urban-rural typology from 1970 to 2016. This study finds the following. Income inequality has remained consistently higher in nonmetropolitan counties than metropolitan counties throughout the study period. However, levels of inequality have converged by 2016, a convergence that has been driven by increases in metropolitan counties. There are notable exceptions to the secular trend of increasing inequality. The central Plains region has experienced decreasing levels of inequality, and inequality in large, peripheral metropolitan counties lags noticeably behind other types of counties. Almost all low-inequality counties in 1970 have shifted to moderate- or high-inequality, such that almost no one lives in low-inequality places by 2016. This increase in exposure to inequality has been particularly dramatic among residents of large, central metropolitan counties. As the only county-level analysis to track income inequality across the rural-urban continuum from 1970 to 2016, this study lays the foundation for more sophisticated analyses that explain spatial variation in income inequality and that account for the demographic and economic diversity of the rural and urban United States.",TRUE,FALSE,income inequality|rural demography|rural-urban continuum|spatial inequality|United States,2019-08-14T19:42:25.646836,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",Brian C.

Unfortunately, however, these techniques have often been developed within disciplinary silos and without broad exposure to other potentially interested constituencies. In this paper, we traverse the literatures of social science, computer science, and statistics to examine a variety of modeling techniques for understanding neighborhood dynamics. We begin our review by examining early concepts of spatial structure first outlined in the Chicago School and discuss how the notions of social ecology and quantitative neighborhood analysis permeated the urban studies for several decades to come. Our survey continues by reviewing contemporary statistical approaches for identifying urban neighborhoods, culminating with the state of the art in subfields known as `geodemographics' and `regionalization'. Following this review, we offer insight into the field's persistent conceptual issues, identify areas ripe for additional research, and highlight newly-developed computational methods that can inform more just and socially equitable public policy, community development, and accountable governance.",TRUE,FALSE,ecometrics|factorial ecology|geodemographics|neighbrorhoods|regionalization|social area analysis,2019-02-27T11:29:07.443132,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/citation/,3frcz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c75b4b582a3950018cd7849/,5c75b4b582a3950018cd7849,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frcz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3frcz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3frcz,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Contemporary studies have also revealed modern poetry’s immense interest in myth. However, only dispersed references to the potential impact the use of myth in poetry may have on nationalism have been made. Moreover, the complex interweaving of poetry and myth has been probed only in general terms, disregarding sundry aspects. Thus, this article investigates some issues pertaining to myth and poetry. Specifically, it interrogates the relationship between poetry and myth, both of which are cogently interwoven to the extent that we can hardly disassociate them. This interrogation attempts to question the role of the ubiquitous presence of myth in the poetry of William Butler Yeats. To meet this objective, this article explores the Cuchulain myth in his poems.

Studies have paid little attention to independent mechanisms that reduce emissions. Statistical properties of the data undermine the estimation techniques used in many studies. To address these shortcomings, we used novel methods and panel data integrating emissions, economic, and energy-system characteristics across 70 economies over 1970-2013 to derive a universal GDP-emissions relationship and identify key emissions-reduction mechanisms. We found that, robust to a variety of estimation procedures, every 1% increase in GDP was associated with a 1% increase in CO2 emissions when controlling for other mechanisms. Emissions reductions were mainly driven by four mechanisms: (i) energy system decarbonization, (ii) increased economic efficiency, (iii) electrification, and (iv) deindustrialization. A 1% increase in these factors was associated with 0.2-1.8% reductions in CO2 emissions per year; together, these factors contributed to 18 petagrams of emissions reduction globally over 1970-2013. Decarbonization contributed most to emissions reductions in high-income economies, while economic efficiency and electrification contributed most to reductions in low-income economies.",TRUE,FALSE,carbon reduction mechanisms|CO2-GDP elasticity|economic growth|environmental sustainability,2019-04-23T10:26:21.874369,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,Ranran Wang; Valentina A.

ezpaq,preprints,2019-03-02,2021-02-08,2019-03-03,NA,10.1093/esr/jcaa035,The politics behind the veil,"Using a natural experiment, we find that in provinces where Turkey’s Islamic Justice and Development Party (AKP) just won the election in 2004, women, including those who are weakly- or non-religious, now veil far more than in provinces in which AKP just lost, the more so the poorer they are. This effect, as we predict, does not occur for praying regularly which is a more costly and harder to observe practice. We argue that veiling is higher in AKP provinces not only because of a generic aim to conform to the stricter mores fostered by the victorious party. We find that those who veil, particularly those in AKP provinces who are not pious, are more politically active than those who do not veil.

The growth of digital learning tools and web applications being used in lessons taking the use of language games to a modern and advanced platform for learners to engage in lessons. The use of interesting and suitable materials along with the various approaches when conducting language games during lessons helps to cater to learners' needs and interests on the subject-matter especially in learning grammar in context. Many researches have used various language games to show its effects on learners ' knowledge, competency and motivation in learning a language, focusing on different targeted language areas and skills such as grammar. Therefore, this paper, based on reviews of past literature, will explore the use of language games in teaching and learning grammar, with reference to second language (ESL) learners.

Due to this, many PSETs often choose to use traditional teaching methods in the classroom which can have counteractive effects on their math anxiety (Harper &amp; Daane, 1998; Olson &amp; Stoehr, 2019; Tooke &amp; Lindstrom, 1998). The goal of this paper is to better comprehend and discover the ways in which math anxiety in PSETs impacts their teaching and whether there are ways to limit these negative emotions about mathematics. Much of the research on this topic look at either PSETs’ beliefs/views or their teaching practices. The focus of this paper will be to analyze the relationship between their beliefs/views and their teaching such to look at how one influences the other or if they have a symbiotic relationship as well as looking at how one’s individual psychology influences these beliefs/views. Using a symbolic interactionist lens, the arguments provide evidence from the literature that looks at the relationships between people and others. Moreover, in touching upon these relationships, this paper also delves into gender issues and stereotypes that have influenced these relationships. The implications of this paper deal primarily with the impact of gender stereotypes on teaching and anxiety as well as what teaching practices are most favourable when looking at reducing anxiety levels in PSETs.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-04-25T18:40:22.401993,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-25,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/citation/,536qg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc0f890fad565001806ffe1/,5cc0f890fad565001806ffe1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/536qg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/536qg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/536qg,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Symptomatisk för denna tendens är den så kallade Föräldrarörelsen, en växande och starkt nationalistisk gräsrotsmobilisering med syfte att försvara föregivet traditionella ryska familjevärderingar mot förmodat destruktiv västerländskt moraliskt inflytande. Föräldrarörelsen primära fokus är en pågående anpassning av rysk lagstiftning till FN:s konvention om barnets rättigheter, vilket av ortodoxa ultranationalister ses som en konspiratorisk västerländsk strategi med syftet att eliminera familjen som institution och, därmed, även rysk kultur och tradition som helhet. Men kampanjens popularitet bottnar även i den generella ryska misstron mot den egna statsadministrationen, som antas missbruka Barnkonventionen för att förvärra korruption och maktmissbruk. Dessa skilda lokaliseringar av ansvar – ”våra” byråkrater versus ”deras” fientliga imperialism – förenas i svartmålningar av västerländska (i synnerhet skandinaviska) system för barnskydd som får representera en dystopisk rysk framtid.

Using data from 30 European countries, I explore this issue through examining three questions: 1) is class identity associated with highbrow consumption; 2) does this association vary across countries; and 3) is the relationship between class identity and highbrow consumption altered when the majority of people in a given society identify as either ‘working-class’ or ‘middle-class’? After accounting for other socio-demographic controls, people who identify as middle-class are more active highbrow consumers than those who identify as working class. Yet, the distinctiveness of middle-class consumption of highbrow culture varies across countries and is negatively correlated with how many people identify as working-class in a society. As more people identify as working-class (rejecting middle-class identities) highbrow culture less clearly distinguishes middle-class and working-class identifiers. In the absence of any class-structured divisions in highbrow culture, whether and how cultural practices function as a form of cultural capital is likely quite different, reinforcing the claim that the centrality of highbrow culture to cultural capital varies geographically.",TRUE,FALSE,class identity|cultural consumption|highbrow,2019-04-11T16:51:03.770436,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/citation/,u9dmy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xyqpa/,xyqpa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cae441939926900170bf6cd/,5cae441939926900170bf6cd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u9dmy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u9dmy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u9dmy,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.poetic.2019.04.002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

On the one hand, biocitizenship entails the positive, active efforts of human beings demanding their rights to health and well-being. On the other hand, biocitizenship is also understood as an extension of ‘biopolitics’ in the Foucauldian sense, so that biocitizenship disciplines and controls subjects even as it affords them certain rights. While this duality and its various complexities have generated a sizeable body of literature, there has to date been no edited volume on the subject of biocitizenship.

In addition, we interviewed renowned scholars in the fields of Islamic accounting and Shariah law. Consequently, this study proposes an extended model of human capital that is applicable to Islamic organizations. Apart from knowledge and competency, this study includes spiritual value as another construct of human capital in Islamic organizations. Knowledge includes ideas that are relevant to the accounting and auditing spectra, as well as Shariah principles and jurisprudence. By contrast, competency refers to the ability to innovate unique Shariah-compliant products that are rare and difficult to imitate. Meanwhile, spiritual values embrace the elements of “Siddiq,” “Amanah,” “Fathonah,” and “Tabligh.” This study affirms that knowledge, competency, and satisfaction are the most significant constructs of human capital that explain performance. Factor analysis indicates that spiritual value is embedded in and forms part of the human capital construct. Hence, spiritual value is a key element in company culture and contributes significantly to organizational success. This model can be a platform for human capital reporting in the relevant Islamic and conventional organizations.",TRUE,FALSE,Human capital; Islamic Organization; Microfinance Organization; Human spirit.|Intellectual capital,2019-06-13T10:33:29.573675,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/citation/,962yu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/hj5s7/,hj5s7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0220c8760f110018fbe7c1/,5d0220c8760f110018fbe7c1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/962yu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/962yu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/962yu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This additive approach enables the reuse of previous efforts of analysis or even the merging of separate research projects, thereby making these methods more accessible and increasing the discipline’s ability to create and share content analysis capabilities. This paper proposes a weakly supervised topic analysis method that uses both a low-cost unsupervised method to compile a training set and supervised deep learning as an additive and accurate text classification method. We test the validity of the method, specifically its additivity, by comparing the results of the method after adding 200 categories to an initial number of 450.

Through a content analysis of 100 pairs of juxtaposed images from the first 24 hours of the hashtag, I examine the ways Black youth negotiate oppressive media representations and produce their own self-images. Through their strategic political response, the users of the hashtag demonstrate their “double consciousness” in a Du Boisian sense as well as their acute understanding of the specific symbols that mark a Black body as threatening and those that mediate the supposed threat. In doing so, however, they expose the limited number of templates available to them for performing an identity interpreted positively by the mainstream media and broader social world, as well as the continuing role of respectability politics in shaping public perceptions of Black youth.",TRUE,FALSE,black youth|double consciousness|race|representation|respectability politics|social media|social movements|visual sociology,2019-02-26T13:59:08.471068,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-26,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d24|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|Visual Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,University of Illinois at Chicago,2017,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/citation/,7jspe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c74308d62c82a0019db4338/,5c74308d62c82a0019db4338,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7jspe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7jspe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7jspe,https://doi.org/10.1080/10999949.2018.1441587,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
6p92b,preprints,2019-06-07,2019-07-21,2019-07-21,NA,10.24093/awej/Chief1.10,Towards more Liable Use of Internet Sources among University Students: Rethinking Teacher’s Routine Evaluation Methods,"Within the flow of information of today’s digital learning environment, university students’ ill-informed use of external electronic sources negatively affects the quality of their academic writing. While sanctions represent but the final disciplinary measure, university teachers’ pre-empting such academic misconduct before the final year project remains a necessity. This paper proposes a reconsideration of the teacher’s routine evaluation methods to promote good study skills, and thus high quality teaching and learning. Drawing on a personal teaching experience (in the department of English of Saida University), the paper suggests simple methods through which students routinely practise sound referencing. Preliminary observational data that triggered the topic of the present paper consist of samples of students’ internet-based assignments and project papers with missing references. Additional notes generated from classroom discussions with post-graduate Master students about (un)intentional plagiarism represent the insider student perspective of its causes. Initial findings reveal that student-submitted non-referenced work was not only due to poor time management, paraphrasing, or note taking skills but also to modelling poor citation habits (illustrated in the academic genres they were exposed to in their formal learning environment, such as PowerPoint presentations, class notes, hand-outs, and so on). The paper concludes with the necessity to raise teachers’ awareness to the importance of providing a good model of well-referenced teaching materials and learning supports as the initial step. Other practical methods consist of constantly checking students’ work for missing references, asking them to resubmit their work with requisite paraphrasing, as well as giving scores for correct referencing.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic plagiarism|digital/cyber-plagiarism|referencing|teacher assessment|techniques,2019-07-21T21:14:28.102149,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/citation/,6p92b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9e45f8c451d0016ea7d2b/,5cf9e45f8c451d0016ea7d2b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6p92b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6p92b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6p92b,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The government obligations in PPP projects are often limited to feasibility study, transaction support and implementing linked government or public sector projects which subsequently raise the question regarding how the required funds should be mobilized by the government for these services as upfront development cost. Generally, any government agency driving a PPP project has to secure budgetary allocation from the central authority for performing the government-side obligations, which is often a complicated and time consuming process due to other priorities of the central treasury. To overcome this challenge, establishment of a central PPP development facility by the government is required. The ability to create and manage such a facility within the government mechanism will ensure seamless development and implementation of PPP projects by different government agencies and will contribute to foster a good relationship between the government and the private sector investors.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2020-09-29T07:15:46.316071,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2020-09-29,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/citation/,qvgp4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ka2rz/,ka2rz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d021be37b8c4d00189aeffe/,5d021be37b8c4d00189aeffe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qvgp4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qvgp4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qvgp4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Christian Nationalism and Support for Same-Sex Unions,"How do overlapping social identities shape Americans’ views toward contemporary social and moral issues? Drawing upon national-level data and employing the theoretical construct of social identity complexity, we examine the link between Christian nationalism–representing a convergence of national and religious identities–and Americans’ views toward same-sex marriage and civil unions. Multivariate analyses reveal that greater adherence to Christian nationalism is strongly and negatively related to support for both same-sex marriage and civil unions, even after controlling for political ideology, religious controls, attribution of homosexuality, and other relevant correlates. We argue that Christian nationalists, who by definition internalize a high degree of overlap between political and religious identities, are more likely to see gays and lesbians as out-groups and same-sex unions as a threat to their sense of self and community.

In this article, we develop a measure of competitive access to destinations that can be used to accurately compare accessibility between regions. This measure stems from spatial interaction modeling and accounts for competition at both the supply and demand sides of analysis, regional differences in transportation networks and travel behavior, and any imbalance between the size of the population and the number of opportunities.

But, what happens when privileged families’ interests conflict with schools’ stated goals? Focusing on the case of homework, and drawing insights from organizational theory, cultural capital theory, and research on parent involvement in schools, I examine how schools’ dependence on higher-SES White families influences their enforcement of rules. Using a longitudinal, ethnographic study of one socioeconomically diverse public elementary school, I find that teachers wanted to enforce homework rules, but they worried doing so would lead to conflict with the higher-SES White “helicopter” parents, on whom they relied most for support. Thus, teachers selectively enforced rules, using evidence of “helicopter” parenting to determine which students “deserved” leeway and lenience. Those decisions, in turn, contributed to inequalities in teachers’ punishment and evaluation of students. Broadly, these findings suggest privilege-dependence leads schools to appease privileged families, even when those actions contradict the school’s stated goals. These findings also challenge standard policy assumptions about parent involvement and homework, and they suggest policies aimed at reducing the power of privilege are necessary for lessening inequalities in school.",TRUE,FALSE,children|education|ethnography|family|homework|inequality|interviews|organizations|parental involvement|parenthood|qualitative|rules|schools|teachers,2019-03-15T00:44:41.741227,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/citation/,vk8bt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c89673e1d73810017c64512/,5c89673e1d73810017c64512,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vk8bt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vk8bt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vk8bt,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They also avoid out-party news sources. We link these developments and argue that, absent direct experience, partisans assess out-party media based off negative and inaccurate stereotypes. This means cross-cutting exposure that challenges these misperceptions can improve assessments of out-party media. To support this argument, we use survey-linked web browsing data to show the public has hostile views of out-party news sources they rarely encounter.

This research is conducted to                    describe the correlation between lecturers’ language style and students’ academic. As one of the aspects of forming academic self-efficacy, language style has an important role because someone who can get information verbally about his ability in mastering certain duty tends to do more efforts. In addition, it makes him more diligent in doing a duty. Also, language style positively increases the student's self-confidence and vice verse. This research involves seventy students who fill in the questionnaire about the lecturer language style and academic self-efficacy scale.  Data were analyzed by using simple linear regression analysis. The result of the research shows that lecturer’s language style has a coefficient of determination of 23.5% towards the students’ academic self-efficacy. Finally, this research affirms that positive lecturer language style can improve the students’ belief towards their ability while the negative language style can weaken the students’ self-efficacy. This is supported by the statement of Pajares (2002) who state that  the negative language style can  easily weaken the students’ self efficacy.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic self-efficacy|enactive mastery|Higher Education in Indonesia|language style|vicarious experience,2019-07-21T21:18:41.957204,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fsne7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fsne7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fsne7/citation/,fsne7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fsne7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fsne7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fsne7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bd1e71c5b4a001aa46506/,5d2bd1e71c5b4a001aa46506,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fsne7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fsne7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fsne7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fsne7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fsne7,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Seven (7) participants were gathered as co-researchers and were selected thoroughly based on the following criteria: 1) They are Filipino who had stroke at the age of 15-35 and 2) They are able and willing to articulate, participate, and share their life experiences. 
	Further, the experiences of the participants were gathered and enhanced through the following methods: 1) Interview, and 2) Storytelling. Subsequently, three levels of analysis were done ensuing the process developed by Martinez (2013), grounded on interpretative phenomenology. Through the process of reflective analysis, three themes have emerged and are as follows: 
(a) “Sometimes, what is forbidden is pleasurable”: Dilemma of Needs and Wants
(b) “I accepted it... my family is still accepting it”: Centrality and Ambiguity of the Family
(c) “I become feeble but stronger”: Resilience in Vulnerability

	The themes represent a recurring pattern among the lives of the co-researchers from having the desire to change their old ways and habits but acting otherwise. Further, these patterns are reflected in the positionality of their family as both a burden that reminds them that they have a disease yet serves as the main reason they continue to fight. This also mirrors how they view stroke as something that defeated them but in the process taught them resilience in life. The insight of a “life in paradox”, then serves as the central essence of the study.
	Insights from the study suggest that the experience of the co-researchers is more than an individual experience of conflict resolution but a phenomenon of family’s contextualization. Studies that explore compliance among post stroke young adult as well as family involvement in rehabilitation is then suggested.",TRUE,FALSE,paradox|phenomenology|stroke|survivor|young adult,2019-10-08T16:44:41.278118,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-08,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hdej/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hdej/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hdej/citation/,7hdej,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hdej/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hdej/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hdej/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9c3c79fcf91f001219b99a/,5d9c3c79fcf91f001219b99a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hdej/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hdej/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7hdej/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7hdej/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7hdej,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Over-time change in the social mobility of children from unskilled working-class backgrounds in Germany,"Research on intergenerational social mobility tends to focus on examining the level of overall social fluidity in society. However, from a social justice perspective it can be argued that the type of social fluidity that matters most is upward mobility from the lowest rung of the social ladder. This article examines the labour market chances of children from parents in unskilled working-class positions, relative to children from skilled working-class and higher social class backgrounds, and how they have changed across four birth cohorts in post-WWII Germany. We find that individuals from unskilled working-class backgrounds have substantially lower labour market chances than individuals from skilled working-class backgrounds or higher social class backgrounds. Moreover, we find that the gap in labour market chances between indi- viduals from unskilled working-class backgrounds and individuals from more advantaged backgrounds has not narrowed but, if anything, has widened across the four birth cohorts we examine. Our results suggest that an important factor underlying this sustained labour market inequality is a persistently high level of educational inequality between these groups.",TRUE,FALSE,disadvantaged youth|Educational inequality|equality of opportunity|Germany|Intergenerational social mobility|intergenerational transmission of inequality|Social inequality|social justice,2019-09-17T14:39:45.297982,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/citation/,6vyr7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d80a4159defac001a19142d/,5d80a4159defac001a19142d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vyr7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vyr7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vyr7,https://doi.org/10.1177/0001699319868524,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Research has demonstrated that children’s early exposure to Bloom’s Taxonomy levels in stories has a “remarkable power” on them (Dickinson, et al. 2012) and helps develop their language and critical-thinking skills (Egan, 1997; Curtain &amp; Dahlberg 2004). The aim of this research project is to investigate the role of Bloom’s Taxonomy in the development of the vocabulary and critical-thinking skills of young Moroccan English learners. The study adopts a qualitative approach and addresses two research questions, namely, (i) To what extent does Bloom’s Taxonomy contribute to the development of the children’s vocabulary and critical thinking skills? (ii) How can the children’s vocabulary and critical-thinking skills development be justified? The comparison and analysis of the children’s story reviews at the start and end of a term reveals significant improvement, among the Moroccan young learners, especially the average ones. They are able to use a wider range of more appropriate and accurate vocabulary and to make use of a more extended, analytical and relevant discourse.

Many theatre scholars and playwrights argue that the value of these plays, which were primarily regarded as fiction or imaginative reconstruction of the past, may prevail over history. Theatre, which is considered the most symbolic form of art, can be historically educative and evocatively accurate. Based on the aforesaid arguments, this study aims to explore the dramaturgicals, theatricals or thespians used in Yerima's Attahiru (1999) in order to repudiate and resist the distorted versions of the colonial history of Sokoto Caliphate in an effective and affective way. To achieve this aim, textual analysis is used by combining its important approaches: author-oriented approach and context-oriented approach. This analysis is significant because the researchers investigated the colonial resistance captured in the play through postcolonial theory. In addition, this paper explores the attitudes of the colonialist and the colonised reproduced in the play and how the play helps in the decolonisation process, as well as how the images of the damaged heroes are reconstructed in the play in order to restore national pride and integrity.

However, it has also been shown that these presumptions must be considered important factors for the formation of journalistic coverage. Against this background, this article synthesizes existing research on dimensions, determinants, and consequences of journalists’ presumptions of media effects.

The centrality of the Second Amendment in American culture can be better understood through the intersection of American nationalism with Protestant Christianity. Understanding the transformation of the Second Amendment from an important Constitutional amendment to an article of faith in religious nationalism provides new insight about the meaning of guns for American identity. This paper argues that the NRA has capitalized on the religious nationalism that arose in the late 1970s alongside the Moral Majority and has increasingly used religious language to shape the discourse surrounding the Second Amendment. The use of religious rhetoric, such as references to evil, illustrates the merging of American civic religion with the New Christian Right’s rhetoric. Using issues of the American Rifleman to investigate the changing discourse since the mid-1970s, this paper demonstrates how the NRA increased its use of religious language to frame the political debate about gun rights through a religious nationalist lens.",TRUE,FALSE,gun culture|NRA|religious nationalism|Second Amendment,2019-06-05T03:17:47.210327,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-05,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/citation/,t3b4j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf6c6e0fe9cf50018bd47fe/,5cf6c6e0fe9cf50018bd47fe,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t3b4j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t3b4j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t3b4j,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-019-0276-z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Remaining true to one’s identity and being faithful to the core values of one’s culture is a complicated matter when it comes to a black living in white society like America, where color and racial identity are rudimentary prerequisites in self-definition and naming. Philip Roth’s novel entitled The Human   Stain (2000) shows how some black figures undress their black identity to wear the prestigious       white one to go onward with life as full selves, to have access to all the privileges the whites enjoy,  and, above all, to live without the specter of race and the decisiveness of epidermal signs. The novel calls into question and revision such essentialist notions as other, class,andrace by describing the crises the subject or self undergoes in the light of racial prejudices, center-periphery relations, and class stereotypes. The present paper, then, addresses the act of self-abdication the protagonist, Silk Coleman, carries out to overstep the feeling of otherness and to dodge racial discrimination. The paper looks into the notions of selfhood and Otherness by negotiating the definition of the self and the distortion it undergoes in its encounter with the Other . The study aims at revealing, primarily, the effects of Black racial-passing, a common phenomenon in American society of the first half of the twentieth century, on familial relationships and cultural heritage.

Na formulação clássica de Max Weber, eles representam dimensões analiticamente distintas, ainda que correlacionadas, da estratificação, que podem influenciar diferentes esferas da vida social. Este trabalho explora a distinção entre as dimensões de classe e status no Brasil contemporâneo, dedicando especial atenção à questão da operacionalização desses conceitos de forma apropriada à pesquisa empírica. Mais especificamente, utilizo dados da Pesquisa das Dimensões Sociais das Desigualdades (PDSD) de 2008 para analisar, pela primeira vez, a estrutura ocupacional das amizades no Brasil e estimar, a partir dela, uma hierarquia ocupacional que interpreto como um indicador de status. Dessa forma, adoto a estratégia de construir uma escala de status que tem em seu centro a noção de distância social, em detrimento de atributos socioeconômicos ou avaliações subjetivas de prestígio. Essa escala de status está associada, sobretudo, com a educação, tanto no nível individual quanto no dos grupos ocupacionais. Ela também é altamente correlacionada a escalas de status mais tradicionais, mas apresenta discrepâncias compatíveis com sua interpretação substantiva. Além disso, a distinção entre trabalho manual e não manual parece determinante tanto na disposição dos grupos sociais ao longo da dimensão de status quanto na relação desta com as classes sociais. De forma geral, os resultados reforçam a ideia de que classe e status capturam diferentes aspectos da estrutura das desigualdades. /// Class and status are the basic concepts underlying most sociological research on inequality, stratification and social mobility. In Max Weber’s classic definition, they represent distinct, although correlated, dimensions of social stratification, that may have effects in different aspects of social life. This work explores the distinction between the class and status dimensions in contemporary Brazil, paying special attention to matters of operationalization of these concepts for purposes of empirical research. I use data from the Social Dimensions of Inequality survey (2008) to analyze, for the first time, the occupational structure of friendship in Brazil and estimate from it an occupational hierarchy that we regard as an indicator of status. Therefore, I take an approach of constructing a status scale that relies on the notion of social distance, rather than socioeconomic features of occupations or subjective evaluations of prestige. This scale is mainly associated with education, both on the individual and occupational levels. It is also highly correlated with more traditional status scales, but shows some discrepancies that are compatible with its substantive interpretation. The distinction between manual and non manual work seems to play a key role both on the rank ordering of occupational groups on the status scale and the relationship between status and social classes.

This creates a barrier to the adoption of purchasing behaviours that would help protect consumers from cybercrime.  One proposal to address this is for IoT devices to carry a security label to help consumers navigate the market. Using a discrete choice experiment, we estimate the potential impact of such labels on participant’s decision making, after controlling for the influence of device functionality and price.  We estimate the impact of three different labelling schemes on consumer choice, and their willingness to pay for devices that carried each of them.  With the exception of a Graded label that implied a device had weak security, participants were significantly more likely to select a device that carried a label than one that did not. Participants were also willing to pay more for devices with premium functionality and those that came with a security label.  While they were generally willing to pay more for premium functionality than security, for two of the labels tested, they were prepared to pay the same amounts. Qualitative responses suggest that participants would use a label to inform purchasing decisions, and that the labels did not generate a false sense of security.  Our findings suggest that the use of a security label represents a policy option that could influence behaviour and that should be seriously considered.",TRUE,FALSE,Internet of Things|Labelling schemes|Willingness to Pay,2019-04-08T22:26:01.492933,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-08,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,Shane D Johnson|John Blythe|Matthew Manning|and Gabriel Wong,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/citation/,4yxp2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cab84f9641d10001abfc6d8/,5cab84f9641d10001abfc6d8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4yxp2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4yxp2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4yxp2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Others point out that local populations domesticate global cultural elements by integrating them into preexisting cultures, generating hybridized systems. In the current study, I argue that local cultures are not necessarily impediments to cultural change and hybridization is only one aspect of cultural domestication. Instead, I find that individuals attribute global norms to local cultural objects as a means for disassociating putatively universal norms from the powerful actors that dominate international politics. I illustrate this process using the case of support for shariʿa (sometimes called Islamic law) in majority‐Muslim countries. Results of multimethod analyses show that with the exception of attitudes about gender roles and sexuality, Muslims who support implementing shariʿa do not systematically object to many so‐called global norms; in fact, they may express more enthusiasm about democracy, tolerance for people of other religions, optimism about scientific advances, and concern for environmental preservation than those who oppose implementing shariʿa. Likewise, many Muslims assert their full participation in global society on terms not dictated by Western actors by repackaging ostensibly universal norms as components of the unambiguously local shariʿa.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural change|global society|local culture|MENA|shari'a|symbolic boundaries,2019-03-19T14:29:41.885455,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology,Brandon Gorman,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/citation/,fmvpe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8fb30c4712b400183b25b8/,5c8fb30c4712b400183b25b8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fmvpe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fmvpe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fmvpe,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12482,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

So, the present study deals with indefiniteness syntactically, semantically and pragmatically. These levels are related to each other and it is not easy to draw lines between them. The study aims at (1)Pointing  out how the concept of indefiniteness is expressed grammatically in English and Arabic, and show the role of articles in expressing the concept.(2)Showing the syntactic, semantic and pragmatic uses of the indefinite expression in English and Arabic.(3)Identifying the similarity and difference between the two languages at the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic levels which may help to get a common core that contributes to the belief in the existence of language universals. The procedures followed in this study include an introduction about the concept of indefiniteness, and a brief survey of indefiniteness in thirty-one languages to show how this concept is expressed in them. Then, indefiniteness in English and Arabic is dealt with at the syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic levels. This is followed by a contrastive analysis to point out the similarities and differences between the two languages.
The study has come to the conclusion that, in English, the indefinite feature exists in the noun, not in the article, and the article has a syntactic function rather than a semantic one. The study shows also that, semantically, indefiniteness in English and Arabic is almost the same, and its function is internal to the language system. Syntactically and pragmatically, indefiniteness in Arabic is more powerful and active than it is in English. Syntactically, the indefinite item is obligatory in certain positions to perform different functions.

Mapping the third space of ICT integration in early childhood education,"The current stage of early years information and communication technology (ICT) integration research has been criticized for not paying enough attention to the unique pedagogical features of early childhood education. Similarly, children’s views about educational use of ICT have been underrepresented in research. This dissertation study contributes to resolving these gaps in the literature by exploring children’s ideas and preservice teachers’ beliefs regarding the role of ICT in early childhood education.

The study consists of two data sets that are reported in three empirical articles. The first study focused on children’s ideas and their contextual roots. The second study explored preservice teachers’ beliefs about children and ICT at home. The third study investigated preservice teachers’ perceptions of ICT integration through the frames of teaching, education, and care, referred to as the EDUCARE approach. In this compilation, the findings of the empirical studies are scrutinized through the analytical device of third space theory.

The findings suggest that there is a dissonance between the meanings children and preservice teachers give to ICT use. Children conceptualized ICT use as a leisure activity whereas preservice teachers approached ICT mainly through learning. The findings also imply that although EDUCARE has been described as a holistic framework in the context of ICT integration, the framework acts as a disintegrating vehicle: When ICT integration was approached from the perspective of teaching, the views were mainly positive. When the perspective was changed to care, the views were profoundly negative. Care-related concerns were associated with preservice teachers’ beliefs about children’s use of ICT at home being extensive and unregulated. Another exaggerated belief was considering children born-competent ICT users.

The results of this study have several implications for early childhood education, as well as preservice teacher education. To make ICT pedagogy truly meaningful for children, ICT should be approached as a cultural form, and space should be given for children’s views, values, and experiences. Additionally, educational technology courses need to pay more attention to aspects of care, as well as to preservice teachers’ often unrealistic beliefs about children and technology.",TRUE,FALSE,Digital media|early childhood education|educational technology|technology integration|Third space,2019-05-27T12:49:42.277983,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d55|Education|Early Childhood Education,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/citation/,tf4rk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cea6c122a50c4001781b5df/,5cea6c122a50c4001781b5df,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tf4rk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tf4rk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tf4rk,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Previous studies mainly adopted a synchronic approach, implicitly assuming that the differences between students with and without a migration background, as well as mechanisms underlying these differences, are constant throughout the educational career. This hypothesis is empirically tested thanks to INVALSI data and a series of  four-levels random intercept regression models (student, class, school and province). Results indicate that the importance of contextual factors on the ethnic gap in achievements is marginal to the relevance of individual characteristics, and that children of immigrants underperform natives at each educational level. However, assessing the independent role of ethnicity on the one hand, and migration on the other, it emerges that: while the negative influence of the migration experience is strongest at higher grades, the effect of ethnicity changes from negative to positive during the educational career.

The Case of Convertible Bonds,"This paper argues that the reduced-form jump diffusion model may not be appropriate for credit risk modeling. To correctly value hybrid defaultable financial instruments, e.g., convertible bonds, we present a new framework that relies on the probability distribution of a default jump rather than the default jump itself, as the default jump is usually inaccessible. As such, the model can back out the market prices of convertible bonds. A prevailing belief in the market is that convertible arbitrage is mainly due to convertible underpricing. Empirically, however, we do not find evidence supporting the underpricing hypothesis. Instead, we find that convertibles have relatively large positive gammas. As a typical convertible arbitrage strategy employs delta-neutral hedging, a large positive gamma can make the portfolio highly profitable, especially for a large movement in the underlying stock price.",TRUE,FALSE,asset pricing|convertible arbitrage|convertible bond|convertible underpricing|credit risk modeling|default probability approach|default time approach|jump diffusion,2019-10-14T22:11:42.196388,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/citation/,zr7hp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da499f7f6b03e001020852f/,5da499f7f6b03e001020852f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zr7hp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zr7hp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zr7hp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Amidst the chaos, analysts were expected to provide stakeholders with impact estimates immediately following the hurricane. Unfortunately, this strong need for fast information after the disaster coincided with limited options for high-quality data sources to help stakeholders address challenges such as resource allocation and bond-pricing. Given the stabilization of data sources since the hurricanes, this paper examines historical demographic and economic data to give a long-term view of population change in Puerto Rico. First, we juxtapose population, employment, hurricanes and significant economic events to make the argument that the clearest driver of population decline in Puerto Rico is simply the economic health of the island (i.e. employment). Second, we focus on Pre- and Post-Hurricane Irma/Maria migration estimates to highlight the spike in outmigration following the hurricanes, as well as the, return immigration in the first half of the first half of 2018. Finally, we study historical net outmigration and employment trends to illustrate the short-lived outmigration impacts of hurricanes while also highlighting the long-term outmigration impacts of economic downturns. In short, we argue that the primary reason people are leaving Puerto Rico is the struggling economy and not hurricane-related destruction. The hurricanes simply exacerbated the economic-related outmigration trends and we believe that any serious plans for Puerto Rico’s restoration must include special attention to stimulate the economy.",TRUE,FALSE,Economy|Employment|Hurricane Maria|Population|Puerto Rico,2019-03-15T21:51:06.931490,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/citation/,3frzu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8c03f1075b640019a2deb8/,5c8c03f1075b640019a2deb8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3frzu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3frzu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3frzu,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11111-020-00355-5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Movement of labour across North American borders changes the membership of cooperatives as well as the leadership and formation of cooperatives.  The socio-economic shifts that affect cooperatives are also accompanied by marginalization of particular populations, including Indigenous communities and racial minorities. International cooperative principles remain ideals to aspire to rather than a reality in practice. Although women and racial minorities have made some advances in equity in cooperatives, racialized women in particular are not represented in leadership positions in cooperatives in proportion to membership in the broader population. On an optimistic note, cooperatives continue to be more egalitarian organizations than other types of organizations and therefore have the potential for leading as positive role models, addressing the intersection of gender and race for other organizations to follow.  Women leading cooperatives will form different types of cooperatives than men leading cooperatives in the same industry.  Additionally women of colour leading cooperatives will form different types of organizations than traditional cooperatives, providing for enriched plurality of organizational forms required for addressing complex socio-economic problems.",TRUE,FALSE,Canada|Cooperatives|Culture|El Salvador|Ethnicity|Gender|Guatemala|Immigrant|Indigenous|Mexico|Neoliberalism|Nicaraguua|Organizational Behavior|Race|United States|Women,2019-09-05T15:35:23.375313,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-05,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development,Journal of Co-operative Studies,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/citation/,hbj9k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7089e95a289c001c4a6ba6/,5d7089e95a289c001c4a6ba6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hbj9k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hbj9k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hbj9k,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Drawing on more recent data, we reassess these trends and discover a striking increase in the ideological organization of American public opinion in the beginning of the 21st century. Using a broad set of issues from the American National Election Studies, we identify rapid growth in the correlations between political attitudes from 2004 to 2016. This emergence of issue alignment is most pronounced within the economic and civil rights domains, challenging the notion that current ""culture wars"" are grounded in moral issues. While elite subpopulations show the greatest gains, we find that economic issues become more highly correlated across the electorate. We also find accelerated growth in the association between issue attitudes and partisanship during this period.

We tested the effect of environmental attitudes on behavior in an online experiment with real money at stake and real-world consequences.

There are various factors that cause language anxiety, the most common of which include learners’ excessive self-consciousness and self-awareness concerning their oral reproduction and performance and their peculiar, and quite often misplaced and mistaken, views and beliefs regarding different approaches. Other potential reasons for this problem could include the fear, and the consequent deterrence occasioned thereof, of encountering difficulties in language learning, specifically learners’ individual problems regarding the culture of the target language and the varying social statuses of speakers. The most important fear is, perhaps, the deterrent fear of causing damage to one’s self-identity. Therefore, while needing to paying special attention to language learners’ anxiety reactions, language teachers have a crucial role in helping their students achieve the expected performance goals in the target language. Another factor that could potentially lead to language anxiety is simply the poor command of the target language. This problem could be attributed to linguistic barriers and obstacles language learners encounter in learning and using the target language. In the current study, using a qualitative, semi-structured interview and the focus-group discussion technique, the researcher aims to investigate the factors that contribute to language anxiety among Arab language learners. It focuses on learners both within the classroom setting and without, i.e. in the social context, and recommends a number of approaches to manage and overcome this problem.",TRUE,FALSE,anxiety reaction|classroom anxiety|language anxiety|language learners|situation-specific anxiety,2019-07-20T21:31:03.922377,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/citation/,nk4em,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa4477641d100019bf6f19/,5caa4477641d100019bf6f19,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nk4em/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nk4em/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nk4em,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

seeking to convey their findings to the wider research community and the public in an accessible
way. Yet, even the most well-intentioned cartographer may introduce misrepresentation by
mapping irregularly shaped and sized areas. This commentary explores the extent to which
different methods of visualising area-based data can remedy (or exacerbate) this
misrepresentation by presenting preliminary results from a crowdsourced survey. Data from the
2016 European Union (EU) referendum at Local Authority level in England is visualised using
four alternative methods (balanced cartogram, hexogram, hexagonal grid, square grid) and
compared to a traditional choropleth map, in terms of people’s understanding of the authors’

We propose for this purpose a method which quantifies associations between categorical variables when we compare groups which differ only in the distribution of a mediating variable such as education. This is analogous to estimation of indirect effects in causal mediation analysis, but is here developed to define and estimate population associations of variables. We propose estimators for these associations, which depend only on fitted values from models for the mediator and outcome variables, and variance estimators for them. The analysis shows that the part that differences in education play in intergenerational class mobility is by no means so dominant as has been supposed, and that while it varies with gender and with particular mobility transitions, it shows no tendency to increase over time.",TRUE,FALSE,Categorical data analysis|Finite-population estimation|Multinomial logistic models|Path analysis,2019-05-10T11:00:26.229053,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-10,FALSE,NA,no,"We do not have permission to make the data freely available.

In our analysis, we use up to ten waves of the “Labour Market and Social Security” (PASS) German panel study and apply fixed effects panel regressions to account for unobserved confounders.

In this sample survey, households’ food security has been measured by the USAID-HFIA model. The findings of the study indicate that 52.8% of the households are food secure, that of 23.3% are mildly food insecure, 14.3% are moderately food insecure, and 9.6% are severely food insecure. The findings on the current situation of household food security among different economic groups is very important for the policy makers to achieve Vision 2020 and the targets of Malaysian National Plans regarding food security, socioeconomic development and poverty alleviation. In order to ensure food security in Malaysia, especial focuses are needed for those who are severely food insecured and those who are food insecured but marginally above the poverty line. Here the involvement of private sector and community based organizations are also important to combat the short run, seasonal, and event related risk of food insecurity as well as for the development of appropriate mitigation and adaptation options to ensure sustainable food security at household level in Malaysia.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-02-28T18:55:27.315297,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/citation/,uazj2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dh5p9/,dh5p9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c776ba68d5d98001a3de4e4/,5c776ba68d5d98001a3de4e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uazj2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uazj2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uazj2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The current so-called ‘universal’ social protection systems guarantee social citizen rights, while the revisited truly universalism guarantees social human rights for everyone. Crisp-set qualitative comparative analysis (csQCA) is used to map and track the level of exclusiveness or inclusiveness into social pensions in the existing 30 social pension programmes on 28 Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries. The article examines the various paths of eligibility requirements in social pensions conditioning three specific outcomes: (1) access for every older-age individual (truly universal), (2) access for every category of immigrant (no targeting by citizenship or residency) and (3) access for older-age immigrants with legal resident status (targeting by residency but not by citizenship). The research makes several contributions. First, it offers a useful inventory of the eligibility requirements for access to the 30 social pensions in LAC. Second, it proposes an analytical framework to redefine universalism after considering the migration-social policy nexus. Contrary to what the literature claims, there are no universal social pensions in the region. Third, the analysis indicates that only in two countries, Cuba and Jamaica, social pensions have immigrant-friendly targeting rules, requiring neither citizenship nor any length of residency to become a beneficiary. A total of 12 countries require citizenship and 24 of them a certain number of years of residency. Moreover, the overwhelming majority of social pensions are means-tested. Finally, the csQCA allows identifying patterns of targeting mechanisms and is used to propose five exploratory regimes of inclusionary social pensions. The article calls for protected international mobility of the older-age population in the form of a truly universalistic system in which the entire aged population has the right to a social pension. Only then, countries would truly adhere to Article 22 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.",TRUE,FALSE,caribbean|latin america|migration|Migration|non-contributory pensions|older-age|pensions|QCA|qualitative comparative analysis|social policy|social protection|targeting|universalism|welfare,2019-10-10T18:48:41.531385,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/citation/,w7zrq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/u687n/,u687n,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9f65a5f6b03e00101c7616/,5d9f65a5f6b03e00101c7616,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/w7zrq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/w7zrq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/w7zrq,https://doi.org/10.1177/1468018119873267,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The article illustrates this with a case study of UK history departments and their assessment by the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE) and the Research Excellence Framework (REF), drawing on data from the three most recent assessments (RAE 2001, 2008, REF 2014). Symptoms of stratification are documented by the distribution of memberships in assessment panels, of research active staff, and of external research grants. Symptoms of a standardization are documented by the publications submitted to the assessments. The main finding is that the RAEs/REF and the selective allocation of funds they inform consecrate and reproduce a disciplinary center that, in contrast to the periphery, is well-endowed with grants and research staff, decides in panels over the quality standards of the field, and publishes a high number of articles in high-impact journals.

fgxtu,preprints,2019-09-12,2020-08-04,2019-09-13,NA,NA,Territoriality and the organization of technology during the Last Glacial Maximum in southwestern Europe,"Climate changes that occurred during the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) had significant consequences in human eco-dynamics across Europe. Among the most striking impacts are the demographic contraction of modern humans into southern refugia and the potential formation of a population bottleneck. In Iberia and southern France transformations also included the occurrence of significant technological changes, mostly marked by the emergence of a diverse set of bifacially-shaped stone projectiles. The rapid dissemination of bifacial technologies and the geographical circumscription of specific projectile morphologies within these regions have been regarded as evidence for: (1) the existence of a system of long-distance exchange and social alliance networks; (2) the organization of human groups into cultural facies with well-defined stylistic territorial boundaries. However, the degree and modes in which cultural transmission have occurred within these territories, and how it may have influenced other domains of the adaptive systems, remains largely unknown. Using southern Iberia as a case-study, this paper presents the first quantitative approach to the organization of lithic technology and its relationship to hunter-gatherers' territorial organization during the LGM. Similarities and dissimilarities in the presence of metric and morphological data describing lithic technologies are used as a proxy to explore modes and degrees of cultural transmission. Statistical results show that similarities in technological options are dependent on the chronology and geographical distance between sites and corroborate previous arguments for the organization of LGM settlement in Southern Iberia into discrete eco-cultural facies.",TRUE,FALSE,Archaeology|LGM|Lithic technology|Western Europe,2019-09-13T18:49:02.947477,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/citation/,fgxtu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/yd2ve/,yd2ve,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7a6ebefcbf44001b4473f6/,5d7a6ebefcbf44001b4473f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fgxtu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fgxtu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fgxtu,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It argues that the tragic resolution brought to the theme of social protest and the characterization of the protagonist is what gives the play its unique place as the quintessential modern tragedy. It is concluded that tragedy and the social theme are not mutually destructive in Death of a Salesman as some critics stated. Rather, they are combined to make an intense dramatic treatment of the modern American individual’s most pressing issues.

The eco-mom theory—the belief that women have greater environmental concern than men because mothers primarily care about the health and safety of their children, while fathers primarily care about the economic support of their household—is often proffered as an explanation for this difference. Researchers who have previously tested the eco-mom theory have narrowly operationalized parenthood; we are skeptical of this theory and believe it needs additional testing. We look at fertility in relation to concern for climate change using the 2010 General Social Survey. Modeling parenthood like previous studies, we find no differences in concern for climate change between women who have children and those who do not. Modeling fertility, we find that having more children is associated with less concern for climate change for women but not men. Additionally, we find no gender difference in concern for climate change for those with many children, but these findings are complicated by education.

The author establishes that the closest relations were between correspondents belonging to the same or almost same hierarchy level and who were bonded together by the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy educational system and school comradeship, eventually obtained high positions in the hierarchy. Communication within the boundaries of individual centers (the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra, collegiums in Chernihiv, Kharkiv, and Pereiaslav, seats of Ukrainian bishops in Russia, etc.) depended on specificity of the environment. Predominant themes encountered in the letters of the Ukrainian bishops included needs of the alma mater, the Kyiv Academy, and the collegiums. The correspondence addressed issues of their legal status, academic staff, financial support, as well as the literary work and publishing activities of the hierarchs.

The steward is an individual who practices in a field in a manner that invites and warrants the trust of the public, other practitioners, and employers to uphold and maintain the integrity of that field. It is important to your sense of professional identity - and also your profession - to cultivate a sense of stewardship; and one of the foundational aspects of stewardly behavior is to understand professional practice guidelines and the types of behaviors that are expected by practitioners in a given field. Therefore, this article presents two sets of guidelines that can support professionalism, ethical practice, and the development of a coherent professional identity for the statistician and data scientist. The American Statistical Association (ASA) and the Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) are large professional organizations with international membership. An overall objective of each of these organizations is to promote excellence in and by their members and all those who practice in their respective – sometimes shared/joint – domains. It can be helpful to consider the field of ‘statistics and data science’ to be a hybrid of, or co-dependent on, these two fields, which is one reason why the two organizations are presented together. Another reason is that both organizations take ethical practice very seriously, and both engaged in lengthy projects to carefully revise their respective ethical guidelines for professional practice in 2018.  Not only does engagement with the guidelines support you initiating, and beginning to demonstrate, your commitment to this particular professional identity, but also exploring the ethical guidelines for professional practice (through ASA or ACM) is a first step towards documenting your commitment to stewardly work as a data scientist. Ethical reasoning, the third focus of this article, helps deepen the understanding of the guidelines and can be useful to generate evidence of stewardly development.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-05-01T11:40:02.631250,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-01,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfe|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Ethics and Political Philosophy|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/citation/,93wuk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8e6jn/,8e6jn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc8aa4b42c4b70017b810b6/,5cc8aa4b42c4b70017b810b6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/93wuk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/93wuk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/93wuk,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To address the extent of political like-mindedness in online communication, we argue that it is necessary to focus not only on ideological homogeneity in online environments, but also on the extent to which specific political questions are discussed in a uniform manner. This study proposes an innovative combination of computational methods, including natural language processing and social network analysis, that serves as a model for future research examining the evolution of opinion climates in online networks. Data were gathered on YouTube, enabling the assessment of users’ expressed opinions on three political issues (i.e., adoption rights for same-sex couples, headscarf rights, and climate change). Challenging widely held assumptions on discursive homogeneity online, the results provide evidence for a moderate level of connections between dissimilar YouTube comments but few connections between agreeing comments.

However, societal responses – from service providers, and friends and family – to help seeker’s disclosures of non-physical abuse are indicative of much narrower understandings. This thesis draws on qualitative data derived from semi-structured interviews with nine survivors of non-physical abuse to examine how responses to help seeking efforts influence stay/leave decision-making. Constructivist  grounded theory was used in the analysis of responses from which two categories emerged – invalidating and validating.  Invalidating responses inhibited further help seeking and prolonged exposure to abuse. Validating responses prompted efforts to alleviate or leave abuse. Drawing on the thesis findings, the discussion and analysis centre on better understanding the social foundations of decision-making and responses. These include: the reasons responses are so influential in the decision-making process, why responses are often incongruent with current policy and practice guidelines, conceptions of abuse in popular discourse, and the impact of social norms and popular discourse on non-help seeking behaviours. Following from this, some of the measures that might be employed to change societal responses to intimate partner abuse are discussed. The current study found that responses to participant’s help seeking efforts were influential in their decisions to stay in, or leave the relationship. The findings indicate that responses to help-seeking efforts are derived from public perceptions of, and attitudes to, intimate partner abuse. Poor understandings can result in poor responses, which can ultimately put the victim at risk. The current societal focus on physical manifestations of abuse belies the complexity of the problem and is detrimental to efforts to address intimate partner abuse. Improved awareness and acknowledgment of the impact of non-physical intimate partner abuse is therefore critical to domestic violence reduction and intervention.",TRUE,FALSE,domestic abuse|help-seeking|intimate partner abuse|non-physical abuse,2019-09-24T11:06:45.300550,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-24,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Social Psychology and Interaction,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/citation/,ctr7h,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d898ff7b3c374001a9b2a0f/,5d898ff7b3c374001a9b2a0f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ctr7h/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ctr7h/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ctr7h,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The number of questions and other help-seeking threads posted per person was unchanged by size, but replies and other more conversational posts increased sharply.

In particular, the author focuses on the Agreement’s capacity to stimulate the implementation of the EU’s “common values” and transpose the norms, general principles, and methodological approaches of EU law into the domestic legal order. It is argued that this potential depends on two elements of the “constitutional identity” of the Armenian legal order: its axiological core and its openness to external influences.

Race is assumed to be self-evident, and merit is no exception. Merit’s reality is not questioned as it is something that is obvious and identifiable within an academic evaluative culture. While scholars note that the definitions of merit reflect the societal elite's cultural norms and definitions of merit transformed to justify racial hierarchies in the U.S., scholars have seldom questioned the racial assumptions upon which these merit transformations take place. Specifically, what have the transformations in merit within the U.S. academy had to presume about race, its role in the social world, and how it operates within the U.S. academy? Conducting a knowledge culture analysis of merit within the academy from 1890 until present, the study argues the contemporary academic evaluative culture has inherited a presumption of the twentieth-century academic evaluative cultures: adjudications of merit are premised upon the colonized proving their assimilability. The colonized have served as fundamental backdrop for how to judge merit because merit in academia’s social world emerged as a language and technology to manage the inclusion of racial difference; or simply, merit as race talk. This myopia makes it so academic evaluative cultures do not question whether the study of merit is the same as the colonial study of intelligence. Given this myopia, academia could begin to explore alternative bases of merit knowledge that are not dependent on adjudicating colonized communities' worth.",TRUE,FALSE,colonialism|culture|higher education|knowledge|racial theory|white supremacy,2019-12-16T03:49:20.941048,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/citation/,9bwu5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df6a433835f3f000db402be/,5df6a433835f3f000db402be,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9bwu5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9bwu5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9bwu5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We challenge Garrison’s assertions that non-binary individuals reproduce the gender binary in that they are more likely than binary trans individuals to use essentialist narratives to construct their gender identity. Due to Garrison’s criteria for participation in his study, all participants identified as trans and were in the process of transitioning. However, not all non-binary individuals identify as trans and consequently Garrison’s theorizing from a small sample of trans identified non-binary folks is problematic. We argue that the small sample size and Garrison’s recruitment strategy do not capture the wide range of individuals who identify as non-binary and that this small sample is not enough for Garrison to generalize about non-binary identified folks. Gender identity is a complex issue and while we commend Garrison for his contribution to the field, we argue that such work should be done with diligence as to ensure that research does not render identities invisible in early attempts to theorize with small samples.",TRUE,FALSE,accountability|gender|gender essentialism|genderqueer|gender social structure|non-binary|trans|transgender,2019-03-17T21:00:03.480496,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/citation/,4usqt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8ea39a80f5d2001883d249/,5c8ea39a80f5d2001883d249,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4usqt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4usqt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4usqt,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Young adults represent a critical social group that needs special attention. Therefore, the present paper tackles one of the fascinating literary genres to young adults; young adult science fiction. The paper attempts to investigate how the social themes of order and chaos are delivered to young adults in young adult science fiction through conducting a critical stylistic analysis of certain extracts in selected young adult science fiction novels. The linguistic tool employed for the critical stylistic analysis is negation for its prevalent use in the discourse, in general, and for its textual effectiveness in rendering hidden ideologies, whether intended or unconscious.

The paper is an attempt to explore the imports of Bangladesh which is one of the most significant factors responsible for unfavorable trade balance of the country. The aim of the study is to intend some initiatives for an attempt to ultimately reshaping the trade balance of Bangladesh with her foreign trade partners. The paper examines the existence of the gravity theory for the imports of Bangladesh with its eight major trading partner countries- India, China, Singapore, Japan, Hong Kong, South Korea, USA and Malaysia. The data set consists of yearly data from 1985 to 2003 in a panel approach. The paper comes across with the findings that the gravity theory is consistent with the imports of Bangladesh. That is, the geographical distance of Bangladesh with its partner countries has significant impacts on its imports. But in near future this may change because of different factors such as profitability, easy trade procedures, product delivery time etc. that influence the imports decision more than does the geographical distance. This paper finds mixed relationship between the GDP and imports of Bangladesh. It also shows that the imports of Bangladesh influence the domestic production very little because Bangladesh mostly imports consumer goods rather than capital goods. Moreover, the population of Bangladesh has significant impacts on imports which in turn implies that Bangladesh is not capable of producing adequate consumer goods to meet the increased demand resulted from high population growth. It also shows that partner countries‟ GDP has significant positive impacts and partner countries‟ population has mixed impact on imports of Bangladesh. This paper concludes that it will be an alarming situation for trade balance of Bangladesh if the imports continue to increase in such a pattern that the rate increases five to eight times more in respect of population increases and at the same time the ratio of capital goods in proportion of total imports decreases.",TRUE,FALSE,Geographical Distance|Gravity Model|Gross Domestic Product (GDP)|Imports|Panel study|Population,2019-02-20T19:30:03.068902,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/citation/,etmzk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mn8yw/,mn8yw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d166f82a3950017c94948/,5c6d166f82a3950017c94948,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/etmzk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/etmzk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/etmzk,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
e2wm6,preprints,2019-03-13,2019-03-13,2019-03-13,NA,NA,Emotions and Populist Support,"Is there a special relationship between emotions and populism? Academic and popular discussions of populism frequently suggest that this is the case, and that anger and anxiety in particular, are crucial explanatory factors for the continued appeal of populist parties.  But despite the often-posited link between negative emotions and populism, few studies have explored this relationship empirically.  
This paper aims to fill this gap and answer three related questions: Firstly, to what extent is the relationship between negative affect and populist party support unique to these parties and do we observe differences between left and right-wing populism? Secondly, what is the temporal relationship between affect and populism?  Do voters support populist parties because they are anxious or does support for these parties create these negative emotions? And finally, are populists angry, scared, or both? In other words, to what extent do we need to distinguish between specific types of negative affect, such as anger and anxiety, when discussing the emotional underpinnings of populism? 
Comparing panel data from Austria and Germany, this paper investigates the relationship between anger and anxiety on the one hand, and support for populist parties on the other. Using a random-intercept, autoregressive cross-lagged design, the paper has three findings. 
First of all, the reinforcing pattern of increased negative emotions and increased party support is unique to (right-wing) populists. Secondly, this relationship is self-reinforcing.

The identified gap was addressed using multilevel logistic regression models.
Methods: Pooled 2008 and 2013 Sierra Leone Demographic and Health Surveys datasets were used. Single level logistic regression analyses were conducted on 24,032 women, and multilevel logistic regression models were performed on 23,329 women. Statistical significance was pegged at p≤0.01 and p≤0.05.
Results: About 22.1% of the reproductive age women ever used a modern contraceptive. The best-fitted model indicated that the effects of individual, household, and geo-residential level factors on the use of modern contraceptives among Sierra Leone Women vary from one community to another. The woman’s age, marital status, educational qualification, listening to the radio, recent sexual activity, household wealth, place of residence, and region of residence were the statistically significant predictors of modern contraceptive use among reproductive-age Sierra Leone women.
Conclusion: The study provided in-depth insight into the significant factors that account for the variability in women use of contraceptives in Sierra Leone. The study underscored the need for community-based intervention programs to address the low use of modern contraceptives among Sierra Leone women.",NA,NA,NA,NA,2020-04-27,NA,TRUE,withdrawn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vu5ag/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vu5ag/bibliographic_contributors/,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,NA,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vu5ag/review_actions/,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vu5ag/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vu5ag/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vu5ag,NA,"This request does not meet the criteria for withdrawal specified in our policy, which you can see here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-VQKAkBHJtAnde-lSgNaS0eA3heXNfwAmXhmyBLzN5E.

These difficulties are especially notable in translations between languages as disparate as Arabic and English, as they come from different language families. The present study aims to understand the strategies required for translating colloquial Egyptian humor into English and highlights the issues involved in the process of this translation. For this purpose, the study selected the book Taxi by Khaled Al Khamissi, as it is composed of 58 fictional monologues of taxi drivers in Cairo. The study highlights the challenges faced in translating colloquial Egyptian humor, along with the cultural differences that hinder its translation. The results show that translation is a major hurdle for culture-based and word-based humor because of cultural and linguistic differences; miscommunication and failure to translate humorous intent are due to lack of knowledge of the source culture. The impact of the humor is not transferred to the target text because a literal translation of word-based humour is not possible. A combination of procedures is used to transfer a humorous effect when translating culture-based humor. The study concludes that universal humour is easier to translate than culture-based humour, as the translator is familiar with the concepts involved.",TRUE,FALSE,colloquial language|Egyptian humor|Khaled Al Khamissi’s Taxi|translation strategies,2019-09-04T02:35:23.773335,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/citation/,quh7t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ee7a8536cf5001a8d10aa/,5d6ee7a8536cf5001a8d10aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/quh7t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/quh7t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/quh7t,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no3.15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This construct was articulated to support and strengthen doctoral education. This paper expands the construct of stewardship so that it can be applied to both scholars and non-academic practitioners, and can be initiated earlier than doctoral education. To accomplish this, we describe a general developmental trajectory supporting cross-curriculum teaching for stewardship of a discipline as well as of a profession. We argue that the most important features of stewardship, comprising the public trust for the future of their discipline or profession, are obtainable by all practitioners, and are not limited to those who have completed doctoral training. The developmental trajectory is a Mastery Rubric, which requires articulating the knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) to be targeted with a curriculum; recognizable stages of performance of these KSAs; and performance level descriptors of each KSA at each stage. Concrete KSAs of stewardship that can be taught and practiced throughout the career (professional or scholarly) were derived directly from the original definition. We used the European guild structure’s stages of Novice, Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master for the trajectory, and through a consensus-based standard setting exercise, created performance level descriptors featuring development of Bloom’s taxonometric cognitive abilities for each KSA. Together, these create the Mastery Rubric for Stewardship (MR-S). The MR-S articulates how stewardly behaviour can be cultivated and documented for individuals in any disciplinary curriculum, whether research-intensive (preparing “scholars”) or professional (preparing members of a profession or more generally for the work force). We qualitatively assess the validity of the MR-S by examining its applicability to, and concordance with professional practice standards in three diverse disciplinary examples: 1) History; 2) Statistics and Data Science; and 3) Neurosciences. These domains differ dramatically in terms of content and methodologies, but students in each discipline could either continue on to doctoral training and scholarship, or utilize doctoral or pre-doctoral training in other professions. The MR-S is highly aligned with the practice standards of all three of these domains, suggesting that stewardship can be meaningfully cultivated and utilized by those working in or outside of academia. The MR-S can be used for curriculum development or revision in order to purposefully promote stewardship at all levels of higher education and beyond.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-01-08T03:29:26.910611,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-07,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d63|Education|Curriculum and Instruction|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/citation/,vw7j5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8e6jn/,8e6jn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3394fa7cf3f5001bb1d812/,5c3394fa7cf3f5001bb1d812,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vw7j5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vw7j5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vw7j5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

United Nations Principles for Responsible Investment (UN-PRI) invites investors to consider ESG issues when evaluating the performance of any company. Moreover, nowadays the contribution of corporations towards sustainable development is a major concern of investors, creditors, government, and other environmental agencies. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of ESG factors on the performance of Malaysian public limited companies in terms of profitability, firm value, and cost of capital.
Design/methodology/approach – A total of 54 companies are selected from Bloomberg’s ESG database that has complete ESG and financial data from 2010 to 2013. This study conducted panel data regressions such as the pooled OLS, fixed effect, and random effect.
Findings - Based on the regression results, there is no significant relationship between individual and combined factors of ESG and firm profitability (i.e., ROE) as well as firm value (i.e., Tobin’s Q). Moreover, individually, none of the factors of ESG is significant with the cost of capital (WACC), but the combined score of ESG positively and significantly influences the cost of capital (WACC) of a company.
Practical implications - As this is a new study on Malaysia, the findings of this study will be useful to investors, SRI analysts, policy makers, and other related agencies.

Nevertheless, being proficient in English language guarantees better job opportunities in various fields and thus learners need to acquire an acceptable level of proficiency. Recognizing its significant role in the learners’ academic and professional excellence, the English language has gained the status of a mandatory language in the Saudi higher education institutions. As students enter universities for higher studies, they are often required to take prerequisite courses in English to gain a higher level of proficiency. This qualitatively driven descriptive case study investigated the attitudes of EFL students who were enrolled in the Foundation Year Program. This study aimed to examine the learners’ feelings, emotions, and attitudes in the light of their academic performance. In total, thirteen male and seventeen female students were interviewed using semi-structured interviews as a main tool for the data collection.  They were asked to recall and write their narratives regarding their experience of learning the English language throughout the foundation year program. The socio-constructivist nature of this qualitative case study offered an opportunity to participants to share their stories. Consequently, it highlighted the factors that motivated them for a language learning experience. Moreover, it allowed them to reflect on the challenges that they encountered during their learning odyssey of the English language course as part of the preparatory year program (PYP). Findings from this research study suggest that the participants’ motivations to learn English are primarily related to socio-economic reasons. Besides, students were particularly motivated to learn English when they were encouraged by their families and by ‘good’ teaching practices.

7e4ht,preprints,2019-10-09,2020-11-09,2019-10-10,NA,NA,How to design institutions that foster cooperation,"Humans typically consider altruism a moral good and condition their social behavior on the moral reputations of others. Indirect reciprocity explains how social norms and moral reputations can collectively support cooperation: members of the society cooperate who others who are considered good. But the theory of indirect reciprocity requires institutions that monitor and publicly broadcast moral reputations. Here we study evolution of adherence to public monitoring in societies where individuals are, at first, independently responsible for evaluating the moral reputations of their peers. We show that adherence to a public institution of moral assessment can evolve and promote cooperation under all simple social norms, depending upon the institution's tolerance to occasional antisocial behavior. We specify how an institution's size and its degree of tolerance towards antisocial behavior can be designed to dramatically increase cooperation rates, even for social norms that previous studies have found to perform poorly. Public monitoring serves to eliminate disagreements about reputations in the population, which in turn increases cooperation and individual payoffs, so that adherence to the public institution can evolve by social contagion. Adherence is then robust to invasion, and it tends to crowd out internal mechanisms that could alternatively support cooperation. These results help explain why societies tend to elect centralized institutions to provide top-down moral governance of their individual behavior.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-10-10T18:46:41.579383,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-10,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/citation/,7e4ht,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9df1b9fcf91f00111b1322/,5d9df1b9fcf91f00111b1322,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e4ht/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7e4ht/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7e4ht,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Specifically, the study aims at answering two research questions: Why Saudi do parents chose to speak English to their child/children? And What are the effects of mostly speaking English on the children and their home language: Arabic? A total of ten participating parents took part in this research study where semi structured interviews were utilised to gather the primary data. Thematic analysis of the data revealed three main emerging themes and six subthemes. The findings from the data analysis revealed that Saudi parents speak English with their children so as to allow them the opportunity to be bilingual and linguistically (English – L2) proficient as well as the fact that those parents were pleased to see their children speak English with a British accent. Also, the analysis revealed that that children of Saudi parents speaking English only has led to the weakening and loss of their Arabic L1 language.

Child maltreatment is one context in which changes to a child’s care and living arrangements, introduced when a child is placed in foster care, could actively improve a child’s wellbeing. In this study, I analyze a nationally representative sample of child welfare-involved youth to examine whether the association between foster care and instability in care and living arrangements is driven by children’s placement in foster care or by the selectivity of foster youth. I find that compared to children who do not enter foster care, those who do are more likely to experience change in their primary caregiver, availability of a secondary caregiver, and their living arrangement. When I treat the initial transition into foster care as necessary, excluding it from my measures of change, foster care appears to stabilize the structures of children’s care arrangements, while their constitutive relationships remain substantially less so. In addition to answering an important question about the experiences of child welfare-involved youth, this study contributes to the more central situation of “institutionalized” family life—including that shaped by the child welfare system—in broader scholarship and dialogue on childhood and family diversity, instability, and inequality.",TRUE,FALSE,children|child welfare|family|family instability|foster care|household|living arrangements,2019-05-17T14:42:00.981811,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek4c8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek4c8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek4c8/citation/,ek4c8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek4c8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek4c8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek4c8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdeb61a8d6e05001b593110/,5cdeb61a8d6e05001b593110,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek4c8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek4c8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ek4c8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ek4c8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ek4c8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We estimate deep (measured as less than 20% of medians) and extreme (measured as less than 10% of medians) poverty in the U.S. from 1993-2016. Using the Current Population Survey, we match the income definition of the Luxembourg Income Study and adjust for underreporting using Urban Institute’s TRIM3 model. In 2016, we estimate 5.2 to 7.2 million Americans (1.6-2.2%) were deeply poor and 2.6 to 3.7 million (.8-1.2%) were extremely poor. While deep and extreme poverty fluctuated over time, including declines from 1993-1995 and 2007-2010, we find significant increases from lows in 1995 to peaks in 2016 in both deep (increases of 48-93%) and extreme poverty (increases of 54-111%). We even find significant increases with thresholds anchored at 1993 medians. Adding homelessness, deep poverty would be 7-8% higher and extreme poverty would be 19-23% higher in 2016, which suggests our estimates are probably lower-bounds. The rise of deep/extreme poverty is concentrated among childless households. Among households with children, the expansion of SNAP benefits has led to declines in deep/extreme poverty.

Accordingly, the practices of subordination and marginalization described in hegemonic masculinity theory are not used to regulate masculine behaviors or obtain dominance in this setting. At Standard High, boys ascribing to different masculine archetypes can each maintain high social status. Nonetheless, a social hierarchy still exists.

Design/methodology/approach – This study utilizes primary data collected by a questionnaire based survey on 186 police officials of Malaysia including Sabah and Sarawak. Data is analysed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and cross-sectional regression.
Findings - The results derived in the study showed a statistically significant positive relationship between three basic variables of the fraud theory – pressure, opportunity, and rationalization with asset misappropriation. Moreover, this study revealed that religiosity is statistically significantly and negatively correlated to asset misappropriation. Therefore, the higher religiosity of an individual correlates with the lower probability involve in asset misappropriation.
Practical implications - The findings will help Anti-Corruption Commission, Enforcement Agency of Integrity Commission, Police Department, and relevant agencies from Malaysia and other countries to design policies for reducing cases of fraudulent behaviour.

This paper explicitly distinguishes the association of mortality with macroeconomic fluctuations from that with fiscal policy measures, using data for 28 European Union (EU) countries covering the period 1991-2013. The main results present a nuanced, complex picture about the mortality impact of fiscal policies. We confirm the mortality decreasing (increasing) effect of recessions (booms), with the exception of suicide mortality, which shows the opposite effects. Austerity regimes are associated with an increase in all-cause mortality (0.7%). At the same time, fiscal stimuli tend to significantly increase death rates due to cirrhosis or chronic liver disease (3%) and those due to vehicle accidents (4.3%). Overall, the results appear to be sensitive to the set of countries included: when excluding the Baltics, Romania and Hungary, austerity policies turn out to significantly increase suicide-related mortality (2.8%), while the effect on all-cause mortality remains the same (0.7%).",TRUE,FALSE,Austerity|Recession and health|Socioeconomic determinants of health,2019-05-18T18:42:07.512548,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/citation/,b2t4x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ya96c/,ya96c,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ce023a123fec40019e122f5/,5ce023a123fec40019e122f5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b2t4x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b2t4x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b2t4x,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ehb.2019.03.002,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Method: This study employs simultaneous equation path models and a recent national, random sample of American adults (Baylor Religion Survey 2010) to test each hypothesis.
Results: Results reveal that constructed opinions about the origin and controllability of homosexuality significantly influence support for same-sex unions. However, these opinions are socially embedded, especially within particular political and religious ideologies.

Empirical Study on the Farming Community in Malaysia,"Changes in climatic factors have different impacts on different social groups. But the farmers are considered to be the most vulnerable group because of their direct and indirect dependency on climatic factors. This study aims to understand the nature of socioeconomic impacts of climatic changes on the farmers in Malaysia. A questionnaire survey was conducted on a sample of 198 paddy farmers in the Integrated Agricultural Development Area at North-West Selangor of Malaysia in 2009. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, ordinal scale and percentile. The study reveals that climatic changes have adverse impacts on agricultural productivity, profitability, income equality, employment, farmer’s health, and government subsidy policy. The Kuznets ratio and Gini coefficient indicate that there is highly unequal distribution of income. Climatic changes are contributing to the widening of this income gap, because poor farmers are affected more by the adverse effects of climatic changes. The current government subsidy policy is not found appropriate and adequate to support and encourage the farmers to adequately adapt to the climatic changes and to reduce the inequality among the farming community.

The rise of the Women’s March as a massive effort to mobilize women primarily on the basis of gender coincided with calls for it to pay greater attention to intersectionality. This study considers the effectiveness of the Women’s March at using intersectional activism as a collective action frame. Drawing on surveys conducted at Women’s March events in five cities and four other Washington, DC activist events in 2018, this study examines the extent to which activists think that the movements should place a priority on intersectional activism. The results show that participants in Women’s March events were more supportive of prioritizing intersectional activism than were activists at comparable protest events that were not mobilized using intersectional collective action frames. Furthermore, the results demonstrate that ideology may be a barrier to embracing intersectional activism, with more moderate and conservative activists placing a lower priority on intersectionality than did more liberal activists.

As a result of this transformation, exchanges have become crucial agents in processes of financialization. First, by organizing capital markets they influence market dynamics, facilitating volatility and market stability. Second, exchanges have turned into agents of disintermediation, selling and exporting financial technologies and expertise, facilitating the development of capital markets globally. Third, exchanges have emerged as politically and economically powerful players, both vis-à-vis other market actors but also towards regulators and states.

To date, however, the drivers of these between-country patters in health inequalities remain largely unknown. In this analysis, we draw on data from 17 European countries to explore whether inequalities in political participation, that is, inequalities in voting by educational attainment, are correlated with health inequalities. Over and above a range of relevant confounders, such as GDP, income inequality, health spending, social protection spending, poverty rates, and smoking, greater inequalities in political participation remain correlated with higher health inequalities. If ‘politicians and officials are under no compulsion to pay much heed to classes and groups of citizens that do not vote’ then political inequalities could indirectly affect health through its impact on policy choices that determine who has access to the resources necessary for a healthy life.

How short-term exposure to refugees influences attitudes and voting behavior in Hungary,"How does exposure to refugees influence political behavior? We present evidence from Hungary, a country with widespread anti-immigration attitudes, that short term exposure during the 2015 refugee crisis predicts anti-refugee voting and sentiment. We code exposure to refugees at the settlement level using news reports from state media, an independent online news site, and an online social media aggregator. Settlements through which refugees traveled showed significantly higher anti-refugee voting in a national referendum on resettlement in 2016. The effect, estimated between 1.7% and 3.6%, decreases sharply with distance from points of exposure. Using a difference-in-differences model, we find that the far-right opposition party Jobbik gained, while the governing right-wing Fidesz party lost votes in these settlements in subsequent parliamentary elections, suggesting incumbents are punished by voters in these settlements skeptical of immigration regardless of their policy position.

Evidence from France,"Grasslands, especially when extensively managed and when replacing croplands, store Green-House Gases. As a result, Grassland Conservation Programs, that pay farmers for maintaining grassland cover, might be an effective way to combat climate change, if they succeed in triggering an increase in grassland cover for a reasonable amount of money. In this paper, we use a natural experiment to estimate the cost-effectiveness of the French Grassland Conservation Program, the largest of such programs in the world. We exploit a change in the eligibility requirements for the program that generated a sizable increase in the proportion of participants in the communes most affected by the program. We find that the expansion of the program leads to a small in- crease in grassland area, mainly at the expense of croplands, which implies that the program expansion increased carbon storage. We estimate that the climate benefits from the program are at most equal to 19%±37% of its costs. The program is thus not cost-effective for fighting climate change, especially when compared with forest conservation programs in developing countries whose benefits have been estimated to exceed costs by a factor of two. When taking into account the other benefits brought about by grassland, we find the benefits of the program to be equal to 32%±62% of its costs.",TRUE,FALSE,Grassland|Natural Experiment|Payment for Ecosystem Services|Treatment Effect.,2019-06-27T17:25:46.624353,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/citation/,cx8j6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9puzn/,9puzn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d14b88d70291a001c699560/,5d14b88d70291a001c699560,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cx8j6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cx8j6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cx8j6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Moreover, the question of the translator as cross-cultural mediator capable of achieving acculturation is addressed. The analysis is conducted following two fundamental concepts in the field of translation studies, namely domestication and foreignization, in addition to another view commonly used by the French philosopher Michel Foucault ""authority or power of language""  which arises through the discourses that we produce, or that others produce.

The social uprising resulted in the ousting of the Governor of Puerto Rico (Dr. Ricardo Rosselló, Ricky), the resignation of the majority of his staff something unprecedented in the history of Puerto Rico; this period has been called El Verano del 19 (Summer of 19). Social media played a crucial role in both the organization and dissemination of the protests, marches, and other activities that occurred within this period. Puerto Ricans in the island and around the world engaged in this social movement through the digital revolution mainly under the hashtag #RickyRenuncia (Ricky Resign), with a small counter movement under the hashtag #RickySeQueda (Ricky will stay). The purpose of this study is to illustrate the magnitude and grass roots nature of the political movement’s social media presence, as well as their characteristics of the population of both movements and their structures. We found that #RickyRenuncia was used approximately one million times in the period of analysis while #RickySeQueda barely reached 6,000 tweets. Particularly, the pervasiveness of cliques in the #RickySeQueda show concentrations of authority dedicated to its propagation, whilst the #RickyRenuncia propagation was much more distributed and decentralized with little to no interaction between significant nodes of authority. Noteworthy was the role of the Puerto Rican diaspora in the United States of America and around the world, contributing close to 40% of all geo-located tweets. Finally, we found that the Twitter followers of the former governor had indicators of being composed of two distinct populations: 1) those active in social media and 2) those who follow the account but who are not active participants of the social network. We discuss the implications of these findings on the interpretation of emergence, structure and dissemination of social activism and countermovement to these activities in the context of Puerto Rico.",TRUE,FALSE,Digital Activism|Network Analysis|Puerto Rico|#RickyRenuncia|#RickySeQueda|Social media|Verano del 19,2019-08-13T20:24:45.240840,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/citation/,wdk9u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5304a0c3f52f0019ff2337/,5d5304a0c3f52f0019ff2337,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wdk9u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wdk9u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wdk9u,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The data was collected by using the designed survey consisting sixteen closed and an open-ended question to investigate the learners’ perceptions in depth.  The results indicate an overall positive attitude of the learners towards BL integration. ANOVA analysis of the variables shows insignificant effect of the ‘level of computer proficiency’ and the ‘level of learners’ language skills’ on their perceptions. The results conclude that the learners’ perceptions are found in favour of BL. Thus, it is recommended to integrate BL to increase the learners’ interest, interaction, and autonomy.",TRUE,FALSE,blended learning|BL integration|ELT|learners’ autonomy,2019-08-04T20:55:42.012789,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/citation/,nmjf2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d47388f90489f001c49d771/,5d47388f90489f001c49d771,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nmjf2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nmjf2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nmjf2,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A total of 87,997,893 documents were obtained, of which 95,304 (0.10%) were in the category of “communication.” In average, 4.24% of the documents in all 184 categories were open access. While in communication, it was 3.29%, which ranked communication 116 out of 184. An Open Access Index (OAI) was developed to predict the trend of open access in communication. Based on the OAI, communication needs 77 years to fully reach open access, which undeniably can be considered as “crisis in scientific publishing” in this field. Given this stunning information, it is the time for a global call for “open access” by communication scholars across the world.

On the one hand, concerns have been raised about the decay of news quality and political culture due to the growing influence of entertainment media. On the other, researchers have highlighted the potential of entertainment in terms of audience interest, cognitive accessibility, and public outreach. A literature overview shows theoretical and empirical support for both sides of the controversy about the (dys-)functionality of entertainment in political communication. Therefore, in an attempt to reconcile the divergent findings, the chapter presents an extended dual-process model of entertainment effects on political information processing and engagement.

Our main questions concern the BRICs’ willingness to accept AEoI, and their agreement to the Western-dominated OECD as its institutional forum. First, we examine the domestic drivers for BRICs’ participation, as their statist model of capitalism reveals strong disincentives to join this regime and the fact that the budgetary consequences of the global financial crisis were less severe than in Western states. We argue that their agreement on AEoI results more from their persistent balance-of-payments vulnerability to illicit capital than from fiscal weakness, while also discussing the possibilities for mock compliance. Second, we review the role of the non-reciprocal US foreign account tax compliance act (FATCA) in shaping the BRICs’ preference for a multilateral AEoI-regime centred around the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard (CRS). Last, we show that the BRICs’ acceptance of the OECD resulted from pragmatic interests and receiving ownership over the process, together with the absence of coercive mechanisms within the CRS-regime that could fundamentally undermine their sovereignty in this domain.",TRUE,FALSE,Automatic exchange of information|BRICS|Fatca|International tax governance|OECD|TAX,2019-10-09T14:35:03.389430,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-09,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/citation/,9nmke,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9c9c84fcf91f001119d642/,5d9c9c84fcf91f001119d642,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9nmke/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9nmke/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9nmke,https://doi.org/10.1080/13563467.2019.1584168,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A common and influential way to understand symbolic boundaries is as widely shared understandings of what types of behaviors, tastes, and opinions are appropriate for different kinds of people. Scholars following this understanding have mostly focused on how people judge others and how symbolic boundaries align with and thus reproduce social differences. Although this work has been impressive, I argue that it might miss important ways in which symbolic boundaries become effective in everyday social life. I therefore develop an understanding of how symbolic boundaries affect people’s ideas and decisions about themselves and their own behavior. Based on this, I argue that focusing on boundary violations—that is, what happens if people express opinions or enact behavior that contravenes what is considered (in)appropriate for people like them—might offer an important way to understand how symbolic boundaries initiate and shape cultural and social change. Using data from Add Health, I demonstrate the utility of this line of argument and show that boundary violations play an important role in channeling social influence.

They were divided in to two groups and each group comprised 200 advanced EFL learners. Explicit morphological instructions were given to group two in the classroom for full one semester whereas group one wasn't given any kind of morphological knowledge. To collect data, exactly the same lists of word-formation on different morphological processes and their use in the writing samples were administered to both the groups. The main objective of this research was to examine the correlation between the morphological awareness and the EFL writing after testing learners' reflection on word-formation. Then it also tried to explore the difference between their performances to check whether the morphological instructions improved their writing or not. The findings stated that group two students always performed far better than group one and showed a strong understanding of word-formation structure while applying and manipulating in the morphological-instructed tasks. The formulated hypothesis-the teaching of explicit morphemic rules improves not only morphological awareness to a large extent but also grammatical, intralingual, lexical and syntactic awareness that results to enhance collaboratively EFL writing competence. A promising contribution of this current study to pedagogy was that explicit teaching of morphology improved writing to a concrete, large extent and revealed clearly that it must be introduced to EFL learners from the early education so that their writing skill can be developed effectively.",TRUE,FALSE,derivation|EFL writing|inflection|internal change|Morphological awareness|suppletion,2019-07-20T21:40:04.709820,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/citation/,s7f5r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa514308a3bf001902ca4c/,5caa514308a3bf001902ca4c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s7f5r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s7f5r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s7f5r,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It debunks the conventional wisdom that Egyptian migration became a socio-political issue only in the post-1973 era, arguing that the Nasserite regime developed a governmental policy that allowed, and encouraged, Egyptians’ political activism in Libya, Syria, Yemen, and the Persian Gulf according to state foreign policy priorities in the 1952-1967 period.

In this chapter I propose that social dilemma research, rooted in game theory, offers a rich and flexible theoretical framework for studying sharing economy interactions. I sketch applicable models that may involve trust as an important feature of many sharing economy interactions but also highlight other strategic considerations that superficially look similar to trust problems but may be understood more fruitfully by alternative models.  More specifically, I discuss various types of two-person dilemmas such as the Prisoner’s Dilemma and the Trust Game, but also N-person dilemmas, including common pool problems, exchange systems, and club goods. Solutions to the cooperation problems implied by these dilemmas are also discussed.

Using data from in-person interviews with sisters, and resources in the SSJ Congregational Archives, I suggest that as they initiated the first corporate stand and solidified their commitment to social justice, the Sisters of St. Joseph experienced a profound internal cultural shift that oriented the congregation much more toward activism.

Simulation study and application to perceived safety,"Open and crowdsourced data are becoming prominent in social sciences research. Crowdsourcing projects harness information from large crowds of citizens who voluntarily participate into one collaborative project, and allow new insights into people’s attitudes and perceptions. However, these are usually affected by a series of biases that limit their representativeness (i.e. self-selection bias, unequal participation, underrepresentation of certain areas and times). In this chapter we present a two-step method aimed to produce reliable small area estimates from crowdsourced data when no auxiliary information is available at the individual level. A non-parametric bootstrap, aimed to compute pseudosampling weights and bootstrap weighted estimates, is followed by an area-level model based small area estimation approach, which borrows strength from related areas based on a set of covariates, to improve the small area estimates. In order to assess the method, a simulation study and an application to safety perceptions in Greater London are conducted. The simulation study shows that the area-level model-based small area estimator under the non-parametric bootstrap improves (in terms of bias and variability) the small area estimates in the majority of areas. The application produces estimates of safety perceptions at a small geographical level in Greater London from Place Pulse 2.0 data. In the application, estimates are validated externally by comparing these to reliable survey estimates. Further simulation experiments and applications are needed to examine whether this method also improves the small area estimates when the sample biases are larger, smaller or show different distributions. A measure of reliability also needs to be developed to estimate the error of the small area estimates under the non-parametric bootstrap.",TRUE,FALSE,bias|crowdsourcing|EBLUP|fear of crime|modelling|open data|Place Pulse|reliability|simulation|Small area estimation,2019-10-02T14:04:57.141784,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-02,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hgjt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hgjt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hgjt/citation/,8hgjt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hgjt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hgjt/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/42v8p/,42v8p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hgjt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d94a6bbc8a75d00176a84f8/,5d94a6bbc8a75d00176a84f8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hgjt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hgjt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8hgjt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8hgjt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8hgjt,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mostly, election is done so as to avert constitutional crisis. Such an election is always successful to the admiration and acceptability of all and sundry when the majority have sincere heart and intention and working selflessly towards communal wellbeing. Admiration and acceptability of any electoral outcome depend solely on the faithful observance of laid down criteria for the said election. Compromise of any electoral criteria (law) gives room for outright rejection of results which may eventually leads to anarchy if not properly managed by the court of the said land. Election of Matthias in Acts 1:12-26 shows oneness of purpose, and willingness to follow a laid down criteria for anyone who would replace the impaired disciple. The criteria suggested two qualified candidates. Eventually, Matthias was unanimously elected and admirably accepted. The aim of this paper is to show that the majority of the electoral outcome that are rejected and contested in court are those the criteria that led to them were highly compromised. The paper argues that if Nigerians were to respect her electoral laws in every election then there will be little or no suit challenging the outcome of such elections in court.

Gathered data was analyzed using interactional sociolinguistics analysis and statistics to arrive at results. The findings of the study indicate that the most frequent shifts of topics occurred after a pause where speakers introduced a new topic. These shifts were performed by using discourse markers such as asking questions, seeking explanations, or telling personal stories. Topic shifts might be violated in informal settings based on relations between participants.

By inviting women to share their ordinarily silenced stories, the hashtag #MeToo surfaced a network of survivors to confront this stigma. Through a mixed-methods analysis of over 1.5 million tweets posted during the first two weeks after #MeToo gained widespread popularity in 2017, we map the landscape of disclosures that emerged and disentangle the effects of network-level reciprocal disclosures, or disclosures made in reaction to seeing others disclose. We detail how survivors disclosed a diversity of sexual violence experiences in solidarity with others, composing nearly half of all authored tweets and comprising a disproportionate number of interactions within the #MeToo network. Further, we show that the more disclosures an individual potentially saw prior to disclosing, the more likely they were to share details with their disclosure. We argue that such network-level reciprocal disclosures may have reduced stigma, creating a counterpublic space safe for disclosure which, subsequently, generated more disclosures. Our work illustrates how feminist hashtag activism, like #MeToo, can unify individual and collective narratives to dismantle the stigma surrounding disclosures of sexual violence.

With the recent increase in the influx of foreign students gaining admission into Thai universities yearly, the result is that such universities will be a coexistence of cultures. This study therefore aims to investigate the situational face-threat contexts where Thai students use silence as a politeness strategy. This aim is guided by the main research question of what different situational face-threat contexts could lead to the use of silence by Thai students in their foreign-peer interactions in a Thai multicultural university context. Twenty students’ interactions were sampled using micro-socio-ethnographic technique, with data from observation, interview, and questionnaire. The main findings revealed that: uncertainty of language proficiency, expected hurting words from interlocutor, and unexpected negative change in hearer’s mood, amongst others, were the main circumstances where Thai students use silence as a face-saving politeness strategy.

By applying and extending a previously developed statistical discrimination model to post-socialist urban China, we examine the association between period age-specific fertility rate (ASFR), as a proxy for the likelihood of women taking maternity leave, and the earnings of young working women and men, as well as its variation across economic sectors. Using data compiled from a random sample of the 2005 one-percent mini-census of the People’s Republic of China, our analyses reveal gender-asymmetric associations between ASFR and earnings among young workers before their prime fertility age, where ASFR on average was negatively related to the earnings among young women, but not among young men. Moreover, such negative association was limited primarily to female workers in the private sector, negligible in state-owned and collective enterprises, and even reversed to positive among those working in government agencies and public institutions. Our findings suggest that employers in the private sector may use aggregate fertility to “evaluate” potential training and replacement costs and the productivity of female employees associated with maternity leave, thereby reinforcing and perpetuating stereotypes and discrimination against women in the workplace.",TRUE,FALSE,Economic sector|Gender earnings inequality|Sex composition of occupation|Statistical discrimination|Urban China,2019-12-12T20:28:20.724433,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-12,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/citation/,kbwz4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5df2926e835f3f000dafeb6a/,5df2926e835f3f000dafeb6a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kbwz4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kbwz4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kbwz4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet the chasm between them is a similarly enduring characteristic of the field of education studies. In this paper, we advocate for the use of the practice brief as an overlooked and grossly underutilized genre of scholarly writing in the field of higher education—in particular the field of community college studies—as one way to more intentionally address the research-practice gap. Crafted, as it so happens, as a practice brief, this paper posits a working definition, provides an overview of the genre in relation to other types of scholarly papers and other fields of study, and enumerates key characteristics of practice briefs to guide authors and peer reviewers. We discuss how practice briefs can be situated within a largely missing form of educational praxis and scholarship such as evidence-based practice (EBP).

Second, we identify six key insights from the sociology of race and suggest how they could influence economic sociology: the emergence of race out of racism, an understanding of racism as structural, the role of whiteness, the intersections between racism and other systems of oppression, the ideology of colorblind racism, and the fundamental connections between racism and capitalism.

The researcher used (pre -post &amp; delayed) translation test, a scale of students' attitudes towards translation to collect data. The study's results suggested that there were statistically important differences at (α ≤ 0.05) in the whole mean grade in the pre post translation test to the group in favor of posttest. Also, there were statistically important differences at (α ≤ 0.05) in the whole mean grade in the pre-post scale of students attitudes towards translation to the group in favor of post implication. Also, the researcher recognized these differences in using the SCAMPER Model in teaching English language translation.

Students’ success in today’s learning lies on their ability to utilize technology as the heart of globalizationas well as to communicate in English effectively within a variety of purposes.  Project-based learning, as one of the technology-based activities, is believed to be an effective method to facilitate the use of technology and oral communication skill in English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom. This article investigates whether there is a significant difference in students’ speaking ability between students taught through PBL using e-poster and those taught through conventional method. It also determines whether there is a significant difference in students speaking ability between extrovert and introvert students taught through PBL using e-poster. Sixty-one Indonesian secondary level students from two intact classes were involved and assigned randomly into experimental and control groups.

Yet the literature has largely overlooked the fact that conjoint experiments are used for two distinct purposes: to uncover respondents' multidimensional preferences, and to estimate the causal effects of some attributes on a profile's selection probability in a multidimensional choice setting. This paper makes the argument that this distinction is both analytically and practically relevant, because the quantity of interest is contingent on the purpose of the study. The vast majority of social scientists relying on conjoint analyses, including most scholars interested in studying preferences, have adopted the average marginal component effect (AMCE) as their main quantity of interest. The paper shows that the AMCE is neither conceptually nor practically suited to explore respondents' preferences. Not only is it essentially a causal quantity conceptually at odds with the goal of describing patterns of preferences, but it also does generally not identify preferences, mixing them with compositional effects unrelated to preferences. This paper proposes a novel estimand—the average component preference (ACP)—designed to explore patterns of preferences, and it presents a method for estimating it.",TRUE,FALSE,causal inference|conjoint experiment|experiment|factorial experiment|political science|preferences|quantitative methodology|sociology|survey experiment,2019-12-05T18:10:43.138961,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-05,NA,NA,available,NA,https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/THJYQR|https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/EDGRDC,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e638u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e638u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e638u/citation/,e638u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e638u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e638u/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/f58ec/,f58ec,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e638u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de88110e1e62f000c38d7d1/,5de88110e1e62f000c38d7d1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e638u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e638u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e638u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e638u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e638u,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A Feasibility Study in Promoting a Saudi-Owned TASL Programme,"Given that teaching Arabic, as a second language has become increasingly significant in the present context, it follows that there is an urgent and pressing need to develop efficient learning tools as well as adequate measuring tools for testing the learner’s development. There are numerous problems associated with measuring a learner’s proficiency in Arabic in the context of Western cultures. These problems are related to the non-adaptability of measuring tools from one setting into another without taking cultural factors into account. The difficulties faced by scholars in adapting Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) tools to the Saudi context is an example. However, the problems associated with such an adaptation indicate the need for context-specific language acquisition measuring tools. Either currently existing tools such as TESOL need to be radically altered to fit Saudi contexts and requirements, or entirely new tools must be created in order to test the efficacy of language learning in Saudi Arabia. This study aims at a close examination of ways in which existing tests such as TESOL may be adapted or modified to suit the requirements of teachers and learners in the Saudi context. A survey and evaluation of existing tools was followed by developing new tools specifically for Arabic language. It concludes by giving recommendations for proposed modification of existing strategies for Arabic learners that associates the language more directly with functional workplace contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,Arabic language learning|second language learning|standardised testing|teaching Arabic as a second language (TASL),2019-07-20T21:41:42.456431,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/citation/,2q5rd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa57c9641d10001bbf0ec0/,5caa57c9641d10001bbf0ec0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2q5rd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2q5rd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2q5rd,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.25,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While journal editors, editorial boards, and political scientists are becoming more aware of implicit biases and adopting strategies to remedy them, we know less about the proper baselines for citations in subfields and research areas of political science. Without information about how many women should be cited in a research field, it is difficult to know whether the distribution is biased. Using the gender distribution of membership in professional political science organizations and of article authors in 38 political science journals, we provide scholars with baselines for gender representation in citations.

Where intersections would typically be open to two-way traffic, in hundreds in cases in St. Louis they have been closed using concrete barriers or cul-de-sacs. These street closures are the outgrowth of a 1970s-era “defensible space” strategy to address rising crime rates. Oscar Newman, who is most closely associated with this paradigm, developed it while a faculty member in St. Louis. The city therefore is not only the birthplace but also one of the most significant test cases for its implementation. In this paper, we provide the most comprehensive data set of closures available, evaluate their location in the city, and assess their association with contemporary violent crime patterns. We find that barriers are located in neighborhoods that lost significant population between 1970 and 2016, particularly in North City and the northernmost reaches of South City. Critically, though the barriers are imagined as crime reduction tools and justified as such in City legislation, we find that they are associated with elevated violent crime rates at the neighborhood-level.

They also make clear that these companies are unlikely to disclose their practices and often go to great lengths to keep them hidden. At the same time, however, these companies are responsible for wide-reaching, influential phenomena that should be of core interest to scholars of information technology. While scholars’ methodologies and ethical conventions have tended to privilege the agency of research participants and focused on the prevention of harm, we argue that the current landscape calls for a reevaluation of these conventions.

Research in translating social media posts has recently received a greater attention among translation studies specialists. This paper looks firstly at Twitter as a growing social media networking and its language and, secondly, shedding some light on translation strategies used in translating English tweets into Arabic. Posts on Twitter, ‘tweets,’ by well-known figures are followed, translated, and reposted in other languages every day. Strategies used by Arab translators vary depending on the importance of the tweet as well as the ideology of the translator and the institutions they work for. This paper, therefore, investigates the translation strategies adopted by the Arab online news agencies, mentioned later, on their web pages in translating some tweets posted by the American President, Donald Trump in his first month of presidency.

Despite significant, longstanding attention in geographical problems, recent advances in non-linear techniques for dimension reduction, called manifold learning, have not been adopted in classic data-intensive geographical problems. More generally, machine learning methods for geographical problems often focus more on applying standard machine learning algorithms to geographic data, rather than applying true ""spatially-correlated learning,"" in the words of Kohonen. As such, we suggest a general way to incentivize geographical learning in machine learning algorithms, and link it to many past methods that introduced geography into statistical techniques. We develop a specific instance of this by specifying two geographical variants of Isomap, a non-linear dimension reduction, or ""manifold learning,"" technique. We also provide a method for assessing what is added by incorporating geography and estimate the manifold's intrinsic geographic scale. To illustrate the concepts and provide interpretable results, we conducting a dimension reduction on geographical and high-dimensional structure of social and economic data on Brooklyn, New York. Overall, this paper's main endeavor--defining and explaining a way to ""geographize"" many machine learning methods--yields interesting and novel results for manifold learning the estimation of intrinsic geographical scale in unsupervised learning.",TRUE,FALSE,dimension reduction|geographical analysis|geographic data science|geography|isomap|machine learning|manifold learning|spatial science,2019-05-16T02:58:06.862107,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/citation/,75s8v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8m2bk/,8m2bk,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cdc4028ea57270019139633/,5cdc4028ea57270019139633,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/75s8v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/75s8v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/75s8v,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ability to be flexible is affected by a wide variety of sociotechnical factors and determines what we term ‘flexibility capital’. Levels of flexibility capital vary in populations, both absolutely and in the extent to which they are primarily derived from technological or social means, which has implications for the (dis)comfort and (in)convenience involved in economising flexibility capital. Furthermore, we argue that freedom of choice over whether and how to economise flexibility capital can be limited by factors such as financial resources, among others. In constrained systems (such as energy networks), the level of service enjoyed by the more affluent may not simply be higher than those who are less affluent, but may be directly enabled by reductions in the latter’s comfort and/or convenience which may not feel fully voluntary. There is a real risk that such injustices could be locked into energy infrastructure and market design and governance for the long term as has already happened in labour markets. We introduce the concept of ‘flexibility justice’ as a frame for these issues of fairness. While the concepts we offer in the paper emerge from longstanding engagements with energy research contexts and they relate directly to the issues currently being debated in the energy research and policy communities, we contend that they can be related to a much broader range of issues in 21st century economies.",TRUE,FALSE,capital|energy|flexibility|justice,2019-02-12T15:42:50.261261,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/citation/,3nja6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gv2ex/,gv2ex,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c618e9be16f55001792dc13/,5c618e9be16f55001792dc13,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3nja6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3nja6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3nja6,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2019.03.015,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Specifically, the objectives are to identify which categories of IMDMs are predominant in Arabic patent abstract and to explain how metadiscourse markers function in these abstracts. To achieve these objectives, data were analyzed quantitatively to count the frequency of IMDMs, and qualitatively to examine the functions of these markers within Arabic patent abstracts based on Hyland’s model (2005). The results indicate that boosters, hedges and attitude markers are the most frequently employed markers while the remaining categories show a low frequency of occurrence. Moreover, the analysis also reveals that IMDMs fulfill different functions, such as providing data in a truthful manner, avoiding commitment to precise figures and persuasion among others. The findings of this research are useful for Arabic-speaking drafters and novice inventors for a better understanding of IMDMs commonly applied in their patent abstracts. A better understanding of the pragmatic functions of IMDMs can improve not only patent drafting skills, but also the chance for successful patent grants.

Low-income racial minority students may have additional personal and academic issues associated with demonstrating grit and overcoming barriers to entry (i.e. institutional racism) over the course of their lives. When the campus environment is not socially or culturally supportive of racial minority and first-generation college students, there is an added risk of mental health deterioration stemming from isolation for these students. The struggle to persist in college, and do so alone, can lead many to experience symptoms of impending “burnout,” or disengagement from academic settings. Drawing from a sample of interviews with low-income racial minority strivers—students who were once highly engaged—this paper offers insight into both causes and solutions for college burnout. Findings suggest that it is important to understand how experiences of isolation manifest to better support minority student populations and foster their academic reengagement to achieve at high levels.

Casamançais multilingual practices,"This paper enquires into the role of multilingual practices in conviviality in shared, socially and culturally mixed localities. I ask how Casamançais use diverse repertoires to get by in everyday life in both Casamance, Senegal and Catalonia, Spain. The concept of conviviality stresses fragile, dynamic processes characteristic of everyday ways of living together with maintained difference. I argue that minimal, but diversified language practices, which compose linguistically diverse repertoires, are central in facilitating conviviality among local residents. Minimal interactions and ‘small talk’, or phatic communion, cushion potentially conflictual socio-cultural differences and inequalities. Firstly, I will evaluate discourses on multilingual practices of Casamançais in both contexts. Second, I will critically explore the reasons for and quality of the widespread use of diverse repertoires. I conclude that multilingual practices facilitate phatic communion sometimes playfully and sometimes as part of coping strategies in situations in which structural forces determine which choices will be more successful than others.

These concepts are REWARD, HUMILITY, HYPOCRISY, and ARROGANCE, which recur in many positions in the Qur’an. The researcher takes up selected Qur’anic verses that carry these abstract concepts and analyzes them at two levels: linguistic and conceptual. The study’s main theoretical contribution is to show how a linguistic approach can be transformed into a conceptual one and how this enriches our understanding of abstraction. The linguistic analysis of the verses is supported by translations of Qur’anic meanings, interpretation of the verses, and cultivating the use of Arabic and English dictionaries. To perform the cognitive analysis, the researcher uses Lakoff and Johnson’s Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT), which examines metaphor from two domains: the target domain, which is the abstract concept to be explained and the source domain, which is the mental mapping that helps us understand that abstract concept. The study finds that metaphors in the Qur’an are meant to be understood not only linguistically but conceptually too. It concludes by emphasizing the significance of a conceptual approach to the study of metaphor in the Qur’an not only for conceptual metaphor theory but also for the interpretation of the Qur’an and for Arabic linguistics.",TRUE,FALSE,abstract concept|cognitive|conceptual metaphor|linguistic metaphor|Qur’an|source domain|target domain,2019-06-04T11:29:44.560644,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/citation/,42gkd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5ed12d987b5001689718c/,5cf5ed12d987b5001689718c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/42gkd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/42gkd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/42gkd,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no2.10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An experimental examination of ethnic preferences in housing decisions,"Residential preferences are often treated as exogenous causes of social and ethnic segregation. In this paper, this assumption is challenged. Instead, this contribution proposes and evaluates how residential preferences are shaped by the conditions of one's neighbourhood. This approach acknowledges the mutual dependence of experienced neighbourhood and housing conditions, residential preferences, and segregation patterns. Doing so, an alternative explanation for the often documented ethnic preferences in housing decisions is elaborated and tested by applying multilevel generalized linear latent and mixed logit models to unique, geocoded data from a choice experiment. Results indicate that people differ in their evaluation of the social and ethnic composition of housing alternatives' residential surroundings. Moreover, these heterogeneous evaluations are largely independent of respondents' own ethnic background. Instead, the observed taste heterogeneity varies over respondents' bespoke neighbourhoods. However, the evaluation of the social and ethnic composition of the housing alternatives does not vary over larger administrative neighbourhoods. This result highlights the importance of proximate, small-scale geographic processes in shaping people's residential preferences.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-10-26T19:00:23.384037,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-26,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dgq4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dgq4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dgq4/citation/,5dgq4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dgq4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dgq4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dgq4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db2e29f0db187000e3d3882/,5db2e29f0db187000e3d3882,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dgq4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dgq4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5dgq4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5dgq4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5dgq4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An Experimental Study Looking at Survey Modes, Respondent Traits and the Desirability of Survey Topics and Individual Questions","This study looks at negative attitudes towards various out-groups and examines in an experimental design the influence of anonymous interview settings on estimates of attitudes towards supposedly sensitive topics. Respondents were presented with instruments meant to measure various forms of prejudice towards out-groups while the interview was conducted at random either as a computer assisted personal interview (CAPI) or computer assisted self interview (CASI). The scales used in this study can be shown to be both reliable as well as valid, furthermore, in accordance with various research by Bierly (1985), Zick et al. (2008) and Heitmeyer (2005) the results of a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) show various forms of prejudice form a type of generalized attitude. In the more recent articles from Zick et al. (2008), Heitmeyer (2005), Wagner et al. (2008), this is referred to as the ‘Syndrome  Group-Focused  Enmity’  (GFE).  So  while  both  an  overarching ‘syndrome’ of prejudice as well as valid and reliable measures of individual forms of prejudice can be empirically confirmed, the results of the analyses show that prejudice towards a specific out-group, let alone a generalized attitude of prejudice, cannot be seen as uniformly desirable. Specific items elicit varying response behaviour. Item- and topic-trait desirabilities were established to help explain the extent to which the survey mode affected estimates. Other respondent- and item-related characteristics also influence SD bias.

Stimulus variation as a teaching skill is used to stimulate students‟ interest and attract their attention to the lesson presentation. Therefore, this study investigated the extent of emphasizing stimulus variation in mathematics instruction using logistic differential equation. The study adopted a developmental survey design where a cross-section of in-service mathematics teachers in Imo State numbering 94 were continuously observed and surveyed to decipher their extent of emphasizing stimulus variation in the classroom to promote teaching excellence. The observations were carried out for 14 days and the data were generated based on direct observational technique (using observation schedule). The result revealed inadequate and inconsistent emphasis of stimulus variation teaching skill in mathematics instruction. This implies that pre-service mathematics teachers seldom emphasize stimulus variation when teaching mathematics.

We leverage the data infrastructure shared by the main edX instance and one regional Open edX provider, Edraak in Jordan, to compare the experience of learners from Arab countries on both platforms. Comparing learners from Arab countries on edX to those on Edraak, the Edraak population has a more even gender balance, more learners with lower education levels, greater participation from more developing countries, higher levels of persistence and completion, and a larger total population of learners. This ""apples to apples"" comparison of MOOC learners is facilitated by an approach to multiplatform MOOC analytics, which employs parallel research processes to create joint aggregate datasets without sharing identifiable data across institutions.

To achieve this ultimate aim in teacher education, as argued by moral philosophers, psychologists, and educators, teachers should be able to well understand the mechanisms of moral functioning and how to effectively promote moral development based on evidence. Recent findings in the fields of social sciences that have examined how morality is functioning among human beings, moral psychology in particular, provide us with the evidence through experiments and observations. Furthermore, thanks to the development of scientific research methods that enable researchers to investigate the neural-level nature of human behavior, the researchers now can examine neural correlates of moral functioning that constitutes the basis of moral behavior and development.

Most of these studies, though, do not follow former prisoners over extended periods of time and into older adult ages when it is more likely that cumulative consequences of incarceration will be felt. This paper contributes to this literature by employing for the first time the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to estimate the long-run association between individual incarceration and mortality over nearly 40 years, and supplementing those analyses with the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 (NLSY79). We then use these estimates to investigate the implications of the US incarceration regime and the post-1980 incarceration boom for the US health and mortality disadvantage relative to industrialized peer countries (the United Kingdom).",TRUE,FALSE,Decomposition|Health Inequality|Incarceration|Mortality|PSID|United Kingdom|United States,2019-02-11T04:39:27.588038,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-11,NA,NA,no,Data are restricted.,NA,no,Secondary data.,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/citation/,b8xe6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c604a20832ca60018ad8ccb/,5c604a20832ca60018ad8ccb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8xe6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8xe6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b8xe6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, it is unclear if the standard model of intensification is theoretically or empirically justified. This leaves social scientists unable to make reasonable inferences about the relationship between intensification and the evolution of social complexity in past societies. To remedy this problem, I derive a novel model of intensification from human macroecology, settlement scaling theory, human behavioral ecology, cultural evolutionary theory, and niche construction theory. The standard and cultural niche construction models are formalized and their predictions are tested using a comprehensive ethnographic data set that describes food production in forty human societies ranging in complexity from foraging bands to agricultural states. Analysis of the ethnographic record suggests we reject the standard model and tentatively accept the cultural niche construction model. I attempt to demonstrate the broader utility of the cultural niche construction model as a framework that may help explain the transition from small-scale to large-scale complex societies.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-08-11T13:05:02.876795,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,David S.

Scholars agree that the news media are key to movement organizations’ influence, helping them alter public discourse and effect political change, but often find that protest is covered non-substantively. Employing insights from literatures on historical institutionalism, the social organization of the news, and the consequences of movements, we elaborate an “institutional mediation” model that identifies the interactive effects on coverage of news institutions’ operating procedures, movement organizations’ characteristics and action, and political contexts.  Although movement actors suffer compound legitimacy deficits with journalists, the institutional mediation model identifies the openings news institutions provide, the movement organizational characteristics and collective action likely to induce substantive news treatment, and the political contexts that will amplify or dampen these effects. We derive four interactive hypotheses from this model addressing organizational identities, collective action, and political contexts on news outcomes.  We appraise the hypotheses with comparative and qualitative comparative analyses of more than 1000 individually coded articles discussing the five most-covered organizations of the 1960s U.S. civil rights movement across four national newspapers.

Register synthesis has tended to use more theoretically articulated notions of register and genre than analysis work, which often seeks to categorize on the basis of intuitive and somewhat incoherent notions of prelabeled “text types”.

In response, states try to curtail such profit shifting activities while at the same time attempting to retain and attract multinational corporations. We aim to open up this dichotomy between states and corporations and argue that a wealth defence industry of professional service firms plays a crucial role as facilitators.

Investigating the Impact of Recovery Aid on Migration Status as a Potential Tool for Disaster Risk Reduction in the Aftermath of Volcanic Eruptions in Merapi, Indonesia","Disasters are associated strongly with forced migration. Indeed, migration is a standard survival strategy for those facing disruptions of this kind. Such is the case with Mt. Merapi, Indonesia, where a series of eruptions occurred in 2010. Mechanisms related to forced migration in such scenarios are fairly well understood, yet it remains less clear what factors may influence return migration. Given local interest in facilitating resettlement out of hazardous areas as a means of risk reduction, we seek to better understand the extent to which recovery aid may create incentives for households to move on rather than move home. We draw upon data collected from a pilot study in the aftermath of the 2010 eruptions and use multinomial logistic regression models to explore the influence of various forms of aid on migration status. Of the various forms of aid considered, financial recovery aid provided to households was consistently associated with moving on. The combination of financial recovery aid with remittances resulted in an association with having moved on that was even stronger than just receiving financial recovery aid. Ultimately, analyses of ""aid packages'""  suggest that a combination of most, if not all, of the aid was relatively more effective in fostering resettlement, suggesting that while food and health recovery aid as well as remittances may not have been sufficient in and of themselves to increase resettlement, they may enhance the effect of financial recovery aid.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-05-06T16:00:25.864784,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-06,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcm58/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcm58/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcm58/citation/,qcm58,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcm58/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcm58/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/mbfdp/,mbfdp,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcm58/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccf9a0910339000179d8f88/,5ccf9a0910339000179d8f88,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcm58/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcm58/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qcm58/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qcm58/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qcm58,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Particularly, the paper attempts to analyze transitivity or process types from a semantic-grammatical point of view based on Halliday's (1985) framework of Systemic Functional Grammar. The study aims to describe and compare the process types used by the authors to transmit their experiences/ideations and fulfill the intended purposes. To this end, eight articles from Washington Post (WP) &amp; Arab News (AN) online newspapers were analyzed. The selected texts were divided into clauses and the process types (material, mental, relational, verbal, existential &amp; behavior) were identified and compared. The analysis reveals that the authors of both newspapers give prominence to the use of material and relational processes seeming to focus exclusively on the actions of physical nature and make links between actions and actors with some qualities associated with them. The subsequently used processes in WP articles are verbal, mental and existential; whereas in AN articles they are mental, existential and verbal. Behavior process is the last and least frequently used process type in both newspapers articles showing that the physiological responses of the actors are not a major involvement. However, the rates of process types in all articles of both newspapers differ considerably. This variation is ascribed to the authors' choice to include a process type more than the other or exclude another to transmit their own experiences and bring about the intended purpose.",TRUE,FALSE,ideational meaning|process types|systemic functional grammar|transitivity,2019-07-20T21:36:42.401319,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/citation/,ydvgs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa4ddddf977b001af3d831/,5caa4ddddf977b001af3d831,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ydvgs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ydvgs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ydvgs,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It aims to identify gender-based perceptions of English language teachers from a Saudi university regarding the role of the textbooks, study material, support of English language teachers, the students’ learning strategies, students’ motivation and self-evaluation in enhancing learner autonomy. This empirical survey has involved 30 male and 30 female (n=60) English language teachers from English language center of Taif University, Saudi Arabia to record their insights and views about their perceptions and prospects of these pedagogical constructs in their teaching practices. The participants of the study responded to a 35-point Likert-scale modified questionnaire to generate data. Independent-samples T-test has been run to calculate percentages of their responses as well as to identify any statistically significant gender-based differences.

Identifying typologies through cluster analysis, thus disregarding individual sequences’ peculiarities, is the aim of most applications. However, a substantive interpretation of such typology can be questionable when clusters include sequences deviating from the others. We propose an integrated approach to identify such sequences, distinguishing between sequences presenting structural peculiarities and randomly deviating sequences. We monitor the quality of partitions with respect to the amount and type of deviation in each cluster relying on novel graphical tools allowing to properly visualize and closely inspect the structure of deviating sequences. We demonstrate that the identification of deviating sequences provides relevant insights also when clusters are used as dependent or independent variables in an explanatory framework, for example in combination with multinomial logistic regression analysis.",TRUE,FALSE,cluster analysis|index plot|sequence analysis|validation|visualization,2019-09-27T00:17:24.724350,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-26,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/citation/,v7mj8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8a323cb3c37400199c100f/,5d8a323cb3c37400199c100f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v7mj8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v7mj8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v7mj8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Members of European environmental grassroots initiatives reconcile lower carbon footprints with higher life satisfaction and income increases,"Scientists and policymakers recognize the need to address consumption and lifestyles in order to reconcile environmental and development agendas. Sustainability-oriented grassroots initiatives emerge bottom-up to create
opportunities for sustainable lifestyles; yet no prior assessment has ascertained the efficacy of their members to reduce carbon footprints (CF) and enhance well-being. We compare the CF of non-members and members of
grassroots initiatives in the domains of food, clothing, housing and transport. We further compare the groups by
testing the influence of socio-economic variables that are typically associated with both footprint and well-being.
Here we show that grassroots initiative members have 16% lower total carbon footprint, and 43% and 86%
lower carbon footprints for food and clothing respectively, compared to their “non-member” regional sociodemographic counterparts. We find a higher adoption of some energy-saving behaviors for initiative members
such as greater active travel distance and lower indoor temperatures in the winter, yet no significant differences
in the CF of housing and transport. Interestingly, increases in income are not associated with increases in the
total CF of members, while the influence of income is confirmed for the CF of the total sample. Instead, factors
such as age, household size, and gender better explain the variation in the domain-specific CFs of initiative
members. Finally, members show higher life satisfaction compared to non-members and are 11–13% more likely
to evaluate their life positively. Our results suggest that initiative members uncover lifestyle features that not
only enable lower emissions, but also reconcile emissions with income and well-being.",TRUE,FALSE,carbon footprint|double dividend|grassroots initiatives|life satisfaction|sustainable consumption|volunteers,2019-11-27T16:26:01.598998,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Experimental Analysis of Behavior|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/citation/,3at5z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dde84a1fbde36000a943d88/,5dde84a1fbde36000a943d88,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3at5z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3at5z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3at5z,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2019.101329,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The representation of women and ethnic groups in TED talks,"We investigate the representation of women and ethnic groups in TED talks, which reach a large online audience on YouTube with science-related content and topics on societal change. We argue that gaps in representation can create a misleading perception of science and the respective topics discussed in these talks. We validate annotations from an image recognition algorithm for identifying speaker ethnicity and gender to compile a data set of 2,333 TED talks and 1.2 million YouTube comments. Findings show that more than half of all talks were given by white male speakers. While the share of women increased over time, it is constantly low for non-white speakers. Topic modeling further shows that the share of talks addressing inequalities which affect both groups is low, but increasing over time. However, talks about inequalities and those given by female speakers receive substantially more negative sentiment on YouTube than others.

Many critics have commented on the plot and background of the novel. The main aim  of this study is to reveal various instances projecting kindness and sympathy in between the social conflict and social tension at the background of the novel “Great Expectation. The study will focus on the concept of kindness towards others which has been incorporated throughout the story of the novel between the narrator and the characters. Charles Dickens (1812- 1870) has shed light upon the theme of social mobility, manners, social injustice and prospect towards tangible reality. This study answers the question whether Dickens could be able to reflect the concept of kindness in the novel or not? Moreover, it will search whether the concept of kindness has been explored well in the story of the novel that it contains probable educational contents of kindness for research. To prove that, the article will explore various aspects of kindness, which has been observed during the course of the novel. The study would be based on qualitative research method from secondary resources. The aspect of kindness would be analyzed and highlighted through multiple scenes from the novel.

This shows how one of the biggest educational challenges for K – 12 STEM education is that few general guidelines or models exist for teachers to follow regarding how to teach using STEM integration approaches in their classroom. This also goes to show how the most common conception of STEM education might be the notion of integration – meaning that STEM is the purposeful integrations of the various disciplines as used in solving real – word problems. Despite the benefits of integrated curricula seem clear, there are barriers that must be negotiated when teachers choose to implement integrated STEM curricula. Therefore, the focus of this literature review will also be on quantitative studies that provide information on teachers continuously using a traditional instruction contradicting the definition of integrated STEM education.

Grounded on focused ethnography, seven (7) informants from two stroke unit from two selected hospitals within Metro Manila were chosen to be informants in this study. Participants were selected based on the criteria that (1) They are currently working as nurses in the stroke unit with at least five years of exposure in the said area and (2) they are fluent in English and Tagalog and are willing to participate in this study. Interviews and story-telling sessions were done to gather the necessary narratives which was then analyzed via the process of thematization. 
After the process of analysis, three themes were identified and are as follows: (1) Technical proficiency as a sign of competence; (2) Perceived autonomy as a mark of dignity; (3) Relational expertise as a manifestation of seniority. The themes show in general how technical competence, perceived autonomy and relational expertise were seen by the informants as distinctive marks of their professional identity as nurses working in a stroke units.  
Insights from this study reveal the unique appreciation of nurses working in stroke unit of their concept of competence, autonomy and expertise. The said concepts are deeply ingrained in their everyday lives that it has become part of their disciplinary hallmarks. 
Since  the ultimate aim of focused ethnography is not to produce a universal truth that can be applied to all context and setting but rather provide insights on specific context sensitive phenomena that will serve as a springboard for the improvement of the context where the insights were gleaned upon from, the following implications were proposed: Professional updates, trainings and preceptorship program that focus on technical competencies, communication skills, and conflict management techniques are suggested.

mjg7t,preprints,2019-02-18,2020-07-08,2019-02-19,NA,NA,Assessing the organizational climate for translational research with a new survey tool,"Promoting biomedical translation from bench to bedside and back in organizational settings is a central challenge for research managers and policymakers. For this, organizational leaders need to assess baseline conditions, identify areas needing improvement, and to judge the impact of specific initiatives to sustain or improve translational research practices at their institutions. Currently, there is a lack of such an assessment tool addressing the specific context of translational biomedical research. To close this gap, we have developed and tested a new survey for assessing the organizational climate for translational research. This self-assessment tool measures employees’ perceptions of translational climate and underlying research practices in organizational environments and builds on the established Survey of Organizational Research Climate.

The data are analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively with the aim of finding the most frequent responses that denote refusal by the English native speakers. Most of the expressions used to reflect the British people’s annoyance with the use of cold calls, the majority being brief phrases of refusal. In addition to the recorded calls, two questionnaires were conducted in Britain to shed light on the frequent expressions used on the phone in response to the salesperson. It is interesting here to catalog the range of strategies used by individuals, most of the time verbal, to avoid talking to the salesperson. These strategies seem to exist on a continuum of directness-indirectness. Firstly to perform an act of refusal efficient enough to end the call. Secondly to make the balance between the impacts of refusal per se and the keeping up with the social convention of mutual cooperation presented in the theory of politeness.",TRUE,FALSE,phone conversation|politeness theory|refusal|salesperson-customer|speech act,2019-07-21T21:21:41.915123,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/citation/,bmeyk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2be1fa1c5b4a001aa47156/,5d2be1fa1c5b4a001aa47156,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bmeyk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bmeyk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bmeyk,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most of the descriptive work on data fraud is concerned with diagnosing the causes of fraudulent and deceptive research practices or with measuring their extent, while on the normative side, most calls for reform in academic publishing rely largely on more rigorous data policies and renewed calls for observational awareness. Alas, it remains to be seen whether such methods of self-regulation will be effective at reducing the incidence of research fraud. This paper thus proposes a different approach to data fraud, one that is more likely to reduce the incidence of data fabrication. Specifically, I propose that alleged serial academic fraudsters like James Hunton be charged with criminal wire fraud. My previous work in this domain explored the possibility of imposing civil liability for data fraud committed by academic researchers. This paper, by contrast, will explore the possibility of criminal liability when an author knowingly fabricates data in his research.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic Fraud|Data Fabrication|Hunton|Wire Fraud,2019-07-31T21:00:02.778763,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-31,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/citation/,ubx7g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d41bc2c26ebf5001b865094/,5d41bc2c26ebf5001b865094,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ubx7g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ubx7g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ubx7g,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In an effort to shift the discussion on state-diaspora relations beyond liberal democratic contexts and single-case studies, this article comparatively examines how authoritarian emigration states in the Middle East – Libya, Syria, Egypt, Turkey, and Jordan – behave towards their own citizens living beyond state borders. It identifies how each state develops multi-tier diaspora engagement policies aimed at three separate stages of citizens’ mobility: first, policies of exit regulate aspects related to emigration from the country of origin; second, overseas policies target citizens beyond the territorial boundaries of the nation state; finally, return policies set processes of readmission into the country of origin. In doing so, the article identifies similarities across disparate Middle East states’ engagement with emigration and diaspora policymaking. At the same time, the article paints a more complex picture of non-democracies’ strategies towards cross-border mobility that problematizes existing conceptualizations of authoritarian practices and state-diaspora relations.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab politics|authoritarianism|autocracies|diasporas|Egypt|Jordan|Libya|Middle East|migration|migration diplomacy|state-diaspora relations|Syria|transnational repression|Turkey,2019-07-24T13:15:23.124423,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science,Mediterranean Politics,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/citation/,r7e3x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xgc5e/,xgc5e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d37edb9835aff001857d875/,5d37edb9835aff001857d875,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r7e3x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r7e3x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r7e3x,https://doi.org/10.1080/13629395.2018.1511299,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We examine the changes and consider some implications. We suggest that the adoption of co-citation as underpinning principle for the measurement of knowledge structures has led to re-designation of the value of knowledge and knowledge producers in increasingly quantitative terms. We use notions of ‘institution’ and ‘logic’ to better understand such a change and its implications. Under a new logic that is gradually embedding itself across the higher education sector, the ‘constitutive rules’ concerned with the value of research now prioritize quantification, and tangibility of output, and quality is increasingly equated with citation. Whilst the scientific disciplines have traditionally been closer to this model, albeit with significant national variations, subjects within the Social Sciences and Humanities are now being affected. We present evidence from a small study of the UK higher education sector of university regulation of doctoral degree submission format in two disciplines in the Humanities and Social Sciences (History and Sociology). Our evidence shows the recent and gradual adoption of a practice, previously more common in scientific disciplines, that allows the doctoral thesis to be constituted by a series of publishable papers, known by a variety of names, the most common being ‘Thesis by Published Papers’, ‘Journal Format Thesis’, ‘Alternative Format Thesis’, and ‘Integrated Thesis’.

Prices of 25 and 50 dollars per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions cause electricity emissions reductions of 17% and 22% from present levels, respectively. This suggests significant electricity sector emissions reductions can be achieved quickly from a modest carbon tax. Short run effects refer to operational changes at existing U.S. power plants, mostly by switching production from coal plants to natural gas plants. The results do not include long run emissions reductions related to 1) new investments and retirements of electricity production assets, and 2) demand response as regulated electricity suppliers pass cost changes to retail customers. A state-level analysis of the results leads to the following conclusions: 1) most emissions reductions come from high coal-consuming states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, 2) fifteen states increase emissions because their natural gas consumption offsets coal consumption in neighboring states, and 3) a flat per-capita rebate of tax revenue leads to wealth transfers across states.",TRUE,FALSE,Carbon tax|Climate change|Electricity markets|Energy economics|Energy policy,2019-05-01T11:40:21.395393,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-01,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/citation/,b79yu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/59pf6/,59pf6,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cc8b66e00a81000175d8b54/,5cc8b66e00a81000175d8b54,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b79yu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b79yu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b79yu,https://doi.org/10.3390/en12112150,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The importance of teaching financial literacy in schools is now highly recognized (Lusardi &amp; Mitchell, 2014).

This sent an important message around the world about the importance of financial literacy in schools. The field has not had all its parameters defined and there is a need to identify what is meant by “financial literacy” and what are the goals of this new emerging field. Thus, this review seeks to synthesize and summarize common themes and trends among financial literacy literature to shed light on the goals and definitions of financial literacy.

Variety of measures were employed to gain as comprehensive an insight as warranted given the study limitations of a small sample, brief study period and relatively unsophisticated but freely available AI chatbot. The measures ranged from surveys of anxiety, attitudes toward daily chatbot usage, oral interviews and IELTS testing of English speaking ability. The results were cautiously encouraging: nearly universal endorsement of AI as a non-threatening interlocutor positively impacting subjects’ confidence and to the extent limited by time constraint, enhancing individual components of the IELTS paradigm. Moreover, significant linear relationship between individual anxiety survey items and overall IELTS scores at baseline was observed, lending a measure of validity to the construct developed for the occasion.

These components have direct relevance to quality assurance in engineering education. Literature suggests that better assessment and evaluation practices require certain knowledge and skills about types and methods of assessment and evaluation. It is found that most of the engineering faculty members do not have concrete knowledge about ‘assessment’ and ‘evaluation’ types and methods. Further, it is argued that engineering educators are not well aware of ‘feedback comments’ that are associated with assessment practices. Comments on students’ performances are essential because it helps them to know their strengths and weaknesses of a course. In this background, the paper critically analyses assessment and evaluation practices in engineering education setup across the globe. In particular, it discusses the challenges faced by engineering faculty members while assessing students’ performances.

Panel Evidence on Early Careers in Switzerland,"According to a popular argument in economics, the gender wage gap persists not because of employer discrimination against women, but because of the differential investment of fathers and mothers into paid work and the household. We test this argument by comparing the evolution of wages between men and women before the onset of family formation and gendered household specialization. We use a cohort study of young adults for Switzerland (TREE 2000–2014) and match the two sexes on their intellectual ability and educational attainment before they enter the labour market. We then use the ensuing survey waves to account for human capital and job characteristics as well as for values towards work and family. We replicate our analysis with a second panel study of Swiss graduate students. We find in both cohort studies an unexplained gender wage gap of between 3 to 6 percent in favour of men. This result suggests that young women earn lower wages than young men with the same productive characteristics long before they have children.

But an emphasis on knowledge displaces the complex issues faced by those teachers who identify – or are identified by others – as subject area experts. In this paper we use ethnographic observations and interviews to understand the professional project of art teachers in the United States. This data shows how the “in-between” nature of art teaching -- the teacher not quite an artist committed to their personal craft, nor a pedagogy-centered professional with well-defined objectives -- is a product of ongoing negotiations over the meaning of their work. When seen from relational perspective, in-betweenness is a practical outcome that at one point will color any professional project. In this sense, the troubled category of the art teacher helps illuminate central concerns in any study of teaching as a profession. Rather than deliver our own assessment of professionalization in the classroom, we use our data to illuminate three practical challenges faced by the art teacher. These include the negotiation of tasks that need doing, debates over the meaning and relevance of purity to the profession, and the maintenance of roles through an emergent understanding of expertise.

But many states have restricted the ability of undocumented immigrants to obtain drivers licenses, making it potentially difficult for them to improve their economic standing. The effects of these laws have been tested for their association with traffic safety but not on mode choice itself. Using the two most recent versions of the National Household Travel Survey, I fit a series of difference-in-difference models to estimate the effect of permissive immigrant driver licensing on travel outcomes. Permissive licensing increased the rate of giving rides by about 13% and increased the rate of getting a ride by about 6.5%, but changes to driving alone were insignificant. Results suggest permissive licensing has beneficial accessibility impacts for all immigrants in addition to the positive safety and economic externalities documented elsewhere.",TRUE,FALSE,driver licensing|equity|immigrants|policy analysis|travel behavior,2019-12-22T01:41:22.278685,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-22,FALSE,NA,no,Data include the use of confidential identifiers.

In this article, I draw on ethnographic research of a small public library in a diverse, mostly working class neighborhood in Queens, New York. I show that in addition to providing an alternative to the capitalist market by distributing resources according to people’s needs, the library serves as a moral underground space, where middle class people bend rules to help struggling city residents.

The latter assesses learners using different digital means one of which are social media. The present study investigated the impact of social media, as being one aspect of e-assessment tools, on EFL students’ written production. It tried to highlight the nature of this impact, enquired about the reasons behind their writing difficulties, and explored whether these errors were caused by social media or not. This research work relied on a case study that consisted of 31 third-year undergraduates and 22 English teachers at the department of English at Tlemcen University, Algeria. The data were gathered through the use of two questionnaires administered to both learners and instructors plus two writing tasks, one assigned on social media and the other in the classroom. Data were analysed quantitatively and qualitatively through error analysis. After identifying the different errors produced by the students, the findings revealed that a relationship existed between learners’ use of social media and their writing issues. Their intensive use of social media led to a significant decrease in the writing level of the learners who have developed a new form of writing that includes linguistic habits which reflect the informalities often found on a social media environment, and do not necessarily follow the norms and rigours of the English language. They have become unable to distinguish between the formal and informal context to the point that certain linguistic aspects have become fossilized.",TRUE,FALSE,Error analysis|fossilization|linguistic deficiencies|social media|writing,2019-06-07T11:48:42.949898,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-07,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/citation/,e5ya9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9dee089c9830017bcf900/,5cf9dee089c9830017bcf900,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e5ya9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e5ya9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e5ya9,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This idea was formulated based on the theory of compensating wage differentials (CWDs). A factorial survey is used to empirically examine the willingness to accept lower-paying jobs. An online survey comprised 398 women who interrupted employment due to family reasons.

The reason why writing can be hard to learn is that writers face many challenges the moment they start writing. The challenges could be from gathering the ideas to be written, planning of the outline, focusing on sentence structure, choosing the appropriate expressions, and also making sure of the organization. Moreover, these challenges can cause students to have negative attitudes towards writing. Previous studies suggest that using writing strategies can help student control the writing process which have a positive effect on their writing achievement and their attitudes towards writing. The strategy of mind mapping is used as a pre-writing strategy to help writers visualize the structure of their writing. However, the researcher proposes using mind mapping strategy not only to organize ideas, but also to organize grammatical and linguistic knowledge. This study investigates the effect of using this mind mapping strategy as a pre-writing strategy to enhance female language learners’ writing achievement and their attitudes towards writing in English at Taif University, Saudi Arabia. In a quasi-experimental design, a mixed methods approach was adopted by collecting quantitative and qualitative data. The study population is 128 students in an experimental group (n1= 57) and a control group (n2=71). The former received the treatment of instruction using mind mapping strategy and the latter received traditional instruction. The objectives of this study are first, to identify any differences between the mean scores of the experimental group and the control group on post-tests of writing attitudes and writing achievement; second, to identify differences between the mean scores of the pre- and post-tests of writing attitudes and writing achievement for the experimental group; third, to explore students' views concerning difficulties to write in English. fourth, to identify the strategies they used to overcome these difficulties; fifth, to investigate if students thought that mind mapping helped them write better and, if so, how. The researcher prepared a test to measure the writing achievement of female first-year EFL students, and a questionnaire by Sturm (1996) to measure writing attitudes. An interview was conducted with a focus group from the experimental group to achieve the third, fourth and fifth objectives. Independent samples and paired sample t-tests were performed to quantitively analyze data from the writing achievement test and the writing attitudes questionnaire. Data collected from the interview were qualitatively analyzed. The finding of the current study are first, there exists differences between the mean scores of the experimental and the control group on the post-tests of the students` writing achievement and writing attitudes, in favor of the experimental group; second there exists significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental group’s pre- and post-tests in writing achievement and writing attitudes, in favor of the post-test; third, students’ difficulties to write in English include lack of vocabulary, organization, spelling and grammar; fourth, students are accustomed to memorizing, practicing, and self-correcting, which indicates they are not used to planning their writing; finally, students also positively perceived the strategy of mind mapping and thought it helped them to better write in English.",TRUE,FALSE,attitudes|EFL|freshman students|mind mapping|writing achievement,2019-07-19T19:18:23.440541,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/citation/,r4ybf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cafaf3039926900190cfde9/,5cafaf3039926900190cfde9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r4ybf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r4ybf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r4ybf,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.232,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, to the best of our knowledge, no study to investigate the role of subtitling and dubbing in vocabulary acquisition has been carried out in the Arab world. The aim of the present study is to measure the effect of Audiovisual Translation modalities, mainly subtitling and dubbing, in the acquisition of Arabic vocabulary in an Arabic as a foreign language class (AFL) carried out at Sultan Qaboos College for Teaching Arabic For Non-Native Speakers. In order to do this a couple of questions needed answers 1) Which modality (subtitling and/or dubbing) is more conducive to vocabulary acquisition in the Arabic language? And 2) Which modality is more efficient in the long-term memory retention of Arabic vocabulary? Thirty upper intermediate students participated in this case study, which involved them watching a four-minute clip of the American TV series Designated Survivor in three versions: (a) subtitled into Arabic, (b) dubbed into Arabic, and (c) dubbed and subtitled in Arabic.

A psychologically taxing job, a handful of scholars and journalists have studied the emotional burden for content moderators in the West, many of whom are predominantly based in Silicon Valley. However, much of this work is increasingly outsourced to the Global South, namely in India and the Philippines. Despite the fact that these overseas moderators filter UGC from Western countries, where the cultural norms on topics like hate speech and sexuality differ from those in Eastern countries like India, the academic research to date has neglected to study foreign content moderators and the ways in which their culture may impact their decision-making processes in reviewing UGC. This thesis takes a qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews to study content moderators in India with the objective of understanding not only the country’s booming and rapidly-evolving content moderation industry, but more essentially the subjectivities of Indian moderators and how their culture might influence their work. In addition to presenting novel findings in the general field of CCM, this research ultimately demonstrates that many of the assumptions about Indian content moderators – primarily that they are unable to separate their own cultural upbringings from the US-centric policy guidelines they are meant to uphold – are erroneous and in need of revisiting.",TRUE,FALSE,Commercial content moderation|Content moderation|Internet|Internet policy|Platform governance,2019-11-01T19:38:42.455857,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-01,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/citation/,hjcv2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dbc724bf3bb87000c8a5a18/,5dbc724bf3bb87000c8a5a18,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hjcv2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hjcv2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hjcv2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In fact, across disciplines and contexts, the amplification of 21st century learning has been giving gamification a special place in education. There are numerous studies conducted on the use of gamification among school children, university students or even trainee teachers. Coincidentally, all of these studies have shown that gamification does impact their learning. Hence, as harmless as it seems, any teachers who are not equipped with such knowledge on the benefits of gamification may hinder their learners and themselves from reaching their utmost teaching and learning experience especially when it comes to grammar learning among the younger pupils. Considering this thought in mind, this research was conducted to prove that the use of Kahoot! helps the Year 3 pupils in retaining the English Irregular verbs. This quasi – experimental designed research gathered data from a sample of 35 Year 3 pupils using the pre-test and post-test results. The findings which were analysed descriptively using sample t-test showed that pupils’ performances in the post-test improved over the use of Kahoot! in classroom. In conclusion, this research provides an insight on number of ways that gamification can actually impacted the pupils’ learning; especially in terms of memory retention. It also works as a stepping stone for more researches to study on the effectiveness of using Kahoot! in tackling any part of learning especially among the younger learners.",TRUE,FALSE,Game-based student response system|gamification|irregular verbs|kahoot!|memory retention,2019-08-04T20:55:04.295273,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/citation/,tqh6u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d47399690489f001a4a8392/,5d47399690489f001a4a8392,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tqh6u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tqh6u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tqh6u,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I suggest that patterns of media coverage inform public consciousness and collective emotion. Newsworthiness and gatekeeping theories assert that school or prejudicial shootings and those with more victims are reported on at higher rates. Literature on racial and immigrant bias in media demonstrates that non-white shooters also generate more discourse. The directed construction of shootings and the affective public responses they generate align well with the concept of a “moral panic.” Using all valid cases from the Mother Jones Mass Shootings:1982-2019 dataset which align temporally with Google Trends data, I analyze the volume and decay rate of search topics “mass shooting,” “gun control,” and “open carry,” following US mass shootings from 2004-2019. Shootings with more victims predict a higher volume of searches for “mass shooting,” and shorter search periods for “gun control” and “open carry.” Shootings with educational and religious targets had no significant effects on search patterns. Workplace shootings result in longer search periods for “mass shooting,” and shorter periods for “gun control.” Non-white shooters generate shorter search decay for “open carry.” The results support theories of media gatekeeping, suggesting events with more casualties generate more intense public attention. The consistent negative correlation between search volume and decay length suggests that sensational responses to shootings are not sustainable over long periods of time and prohibit pragmatically addressing mass shootings.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-12-28T16:32:44.845596,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/citation/,dxkt6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e038db70236b8000b7c54fa/,5e038db70236b8000b7c54fa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dxkt6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dxkt6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dxkt6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
jnexr,preprints,2019-04-12,2020-07-16,2019-04-12,NA,NA,Can personality traits explain compliance behaviour? - A study of compliance with water-protection rules in German agriculture,"Going beyond the rational choice approach used in conventional economics of crime, the question arises whether psychological personality traits analysis can contribute to a better understanding of non-compliance and, eventually, to the prevention of illicit behaviours. This study investigated how personality traits are related to compliance with environmental regulation in agriculture. The object of study was a water-protection rule that required farmers using fertilising to keep it a minimum distance away from nearby water bodies. Self-interested infringements can cause serious environmental damage to waters (negative externalities) through nitrogen runoff. In a survey among German farmers, we employed a 10-item version of the Big Five Inventory to measure the traits that are used as predictor variables in a regression analysis. The outcome variable was the farmers’ compliance behaviour in a business management game where rule-breaking was more profitable than rule-abidance. Some noteworthy findings were observed in the surveyed sample. (i) Neuroticism was positively related to ‘overall compliance’, measured as a binary yes/no variable; that is, more anxious farmers were less prone to rule-breaking. Surprisingly, however, a positive relationship between neuroticism and compliance was not found when looking separately at the deviant subgroup; here, greater neuroticism was associated with more severe rule violations, in terms of illicitly fertilised acreage. (ii) In the deviant subgroup, as might have been expected, higher levels of conscientiousness were associated with less severe rule-violations. Contrary to expectations, again, higher levels of agreeableness were linked to more severe non-compliance. A substantial positive relationship was found between extraversion and the severity of non-compliance, in accordance with ex-ante expectation. For openness to experience, no noteworthy results were obtained. The results indicate that agents with heterogeneous personality traits might react differently to identical economic and institutional environments. Moreover, it is suggested that, other than traits, there is another quality in agents (e.g. social control) that may have a decisive influence on their belonging to the compliant or non-compliant subpopulation. Farmers’ responses to changes brought forward by regulators who aim to prevent rule-breaking might therefore differ as well.",TRUE,FALSE,behavioural psychology|Big Five|environmental protection|nitrogen runoff|non-compliance|personality psychology,2019-04-12T16:45:28.572965,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c64|Law|Agriculture Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c75|Law|Environmental Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/citation/,jnexr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb0aabf39926900180f4785/,5cb0aabf39926900180f4785,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jnexr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jnexr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jnexr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Depending on the survey, researchers can use self-reports of lesbian, gay, or bisexual (LGB) identity, same-sex partner cohabitation, same-sex sexual attraction, or same-sex sexual behavior. All measures come with their own limitations. To illuminate differences in these measures, this study examines the intersections between self-reported sexual identity, attraction, and behavior among a nationally representative sample of U.S. men and women aged 15-45. I explore how and when the three measures align, examine the determinants of self-identifying as gay or bisexual based on sexual behavior and attraction, and assess gender differences in the patterns. I find that about 20% of women and 10% of men aged 15-45 would comprise the LGB community if it were defined to include those who report at least one of the following: gay or bisexual identity, any same-sex attraction, or same-sex sex in the last year. This is much higher than the 6.4% of women and 3.6% of men aged 15-45 who self-identify as LGB.

Controlled studies of mice and non-human primates indicate Zika affects fecundity, raising concerns about miscarriage in human populations. In regions of Brazil, Zika risk peaked months before residents learned about the epidemic and its relation to congenital anomalies. This spatiotemporal variation supports analysis of both biological effects of Zika infection on fertility and the effects of learning about Zika risk on reproductive behavior. Causal inference techniques used with vital statistics indicate that the epidemic caused reductions of approximately one-quarter in birth cohort size 18 months after Zika infection risk peaked, but 10 months after public health messages advocated childbearing delay. The evidence is consistent with small, but not statistically detectable, biological reductions in fecundity, as well as large strategic changes in reproductive behavior to temporally align childbearing with reduced risk to infant health.

To explain these divergent paths, I investigate the transmission of global LGBT norms via two mechanisms: transnational advocacy networks and foreign aid conditionalities. In examining LGBT policy adoption across 110 non-OECD countries between 1990-2016, I find evidence that how states are exposed to LGBT norms can indeed help explain polarization. Exposure to LGBT norms through transnational advocacy networks enhances the effect of global pressure and is associated with more progressive policy adoptions, while greater dependence on foreign aid minimizes the influence these expectations are having. Consequently, this study provides new insights into how the mechanism through which countries are exposed to norms shapes compliance and adds new evidence questioning the effectiveness of foreign aid as a tool to advance LGBT rights.",TRUE,FALSE,Foreign aid|LGBT politics|Transnational advocacy networks,2019-07-19T19:24:22.981117,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology,Kristopher Velasco,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xz9m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xz9m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xz9m/citation/,4xz9m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xz9m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xz9m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xz9m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d31fb95835aff0017556f87/,5d31fb95835aff0017556f87,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xz9m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xz9m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4xz9m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4xz9m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4xz9m,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We present a comprehensive theoretical framework that allows for collateralization adhering to bankruptcy laws. As such, the model can back out differences in asset prices due to collateralized counterparty risk. This framework is very useful for pricing outstanding defaultable financial contracts. By using a unique data set, we are able to achieve a clean decomposition of prices into their credit risk factors. We find empirical evidence that counterparty risk is not overly important in credit-related spreads. Only the joint effects of collateralization and credit risk can sufficiently explain unsecured credit costs. This finding suggests that failure to properly account for collateralization may result in significant mispricing of financial contracts.

Poetical Translation of Poetry (English-Arabic),"The translation of poetry has been and will continue to be an issue of great concern to translators, men of letters and readers. Poetry has been approached differently by translators. They are divided into two major parties: tone insists on translating poetry into poetry with respect to all prosodic features; another suggests translating sense with no concern in prosody, especially rhyme, rhm, meter and foot, especially when the translator is for some good reason, unable to translate a poem into a poen in the target language(TL). Each party has their own justifications for their claim. This Paper attempts to demonstrate the merits and demerits  of both approaches at translating one and the same poem in terms of poetic translation for the former, and poetical translation for the latter. The aim behind that is two fold: first to satisfy all types of readers; second, to provide concrete evidence for the argument put forward throughout the whole Paper, which is poetic translation is superceding poetical translation in Arabic for Arab readers who still highly appreciate the aestheticity and poeticity of poetry. At the end of the day, it is left to readers to decide which version to prefer. At times, more than one poetic version of translation are suggested for the same poem by different translators. Still on one or two occasions, a middle way version combining some features of each of poetical and poetic translations, is proposed. It is termed as a ‘semi-poetic’ translation, with the ultimate objective of drawing a comparison between the different versions of translation of the same poem to give readers the opportunity to judge for themselves which translation they go for and why. Convincing readers is a daunting ask, but rewarding at the end.

Drawing on a representative sample of black and white Americans from the 2014 General Social Survey, and focusing on explanations for racial inequality as the outcome, we show that, contrary to white Americans, black Americans who view being a Christian as essential to being an American are actually more likely to attribute black–white inequality to structural issues and less to blacks’ individual shortcomings.

County Median Income Changes and Low Birth Weight Incidence Rates for Black and White Americans,"Differences in low birth weight incidence (LBW) by race and place are long-standing, often embedded in enduring social ecologies where insufficient health resources are paired with an array of risk factors.  Local or group-specific economic resources are known to be a fundamental contributor to these social ecologies, yet few studies have investigated how within-area changing economic conditions are linked to birth outcomes.  This study examines county-level change in median income and black-white income differences as predictors of LBW incidence and LBW racial disparities.  Time-varying county prevalence and black-white differences in maternal sociodemographic and health risk factors (e.g., non-marital childbearing, smoking during pregnancy) are considered as explanations for income estimates. Data come from U.S. birth records for approximately 24.8 million non-Hispanic black and white mothers with a singleton live birth (1992-2014).  Records were aggregated in three-year county-period measurements for the 732 counties meeting eligibility requirements.  Based on county by period fixed effects models, a $10,000 increase in county median income was associated with a reduction in LBW incidence of 2.7 per 1000 live births, and in the black-white LBW gap by 5.6 per 1000.  Time-varying county maternal sociodemographic and health risks attenuated the link between median income and LBW by 72% and 31%, respectively, but not the association between median income and the racial LBW gap.  Contrary to our hypothesis, conditioning on median income changes, a widening racial income difference was associated with a smaller black-white LBW gap (a finding explored in post hoc analyses).  Our results suggest that, if successful in raising median income, local government efforts to stimulate economic growth and employment opportunities are likely to reduce both population incidence and black-white differences in LBW.

The amazon rainforest is a portion of the planet in which for thousands of years its human dwellers have been interacting with nature that it is understood beyond its physical condition. Thus, to what extent Amazonian’s approaches to nature could be considered as a moral philosophy through which the way of conceptualizing nature and its non-human denizens enhances the continuity of life and the intimate relations between entities?

d9zg2,preprints,2019-02-28,2019-02-28,2019-02-28,NA,NA,Belief States in Criminal Law,"Belief-state ascription—determining what someone “knew,” “believed,” was “aware of,” etc.—is central to many areas of law. In criminal law, the distinction between knowledge and recklessness, and the use of broad jury instructions concerning other belief states, presupposes a common and stable understanding of what those belief-state terms mean. But a wealth of empirical work at the intersection of philosophy and psychology—falling under the banner of “Experimental Epistemology”—reveals how laypeople’s understandings of mens rea concepts differ systematically from what scholars, courts, and perhaps legislators, have assumed.

As implemented, mens rea concepts are much more context-dependent and normatively evaluative than the conventional wisdom suggests, even assuming that jurors are following jury instructions to the letter. As a result, there is less difference between knowledge and recklessness than is typically assumed; jurors consistently “over”-ascribe knowledge to criminal defendants; and concepts like “belief,” “awareness,” and “conscious disregard” mean different things in different contexts, resulting in mens rea findings systematically responsive to aspects of the case traditionally considered irrelevant to the meaning of those terms.

This Article provides the first systematic account of the factors driving jurors’ ascriptions of the specific belief states criminal law invokes. After surveying mens rea jury instructions, introducing the Experimental Epistemology literature to the legal literature on mens rea, and examining the implications of that literature for criminal law, this Article considers ways to begin bridging the surprisingly large gap between mens rea theory and practice.",TRUE,FALSE,belief|criminal law|epistemology|experimental philosophy|jury instructions|knowledge|legal theory|mens rea|negligence|recklessness|willful ignorance,2019-02-28T19:28:07.986373,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c52|Law|Criminal Law,James Macleod,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/citation/,d9zg2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c78238082a3950019d0e657/,5c78238082a3950019d0e657,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/d9zg2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/d9zg2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/d9zg2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The case of Indian English in the USA,"Language attitudes inform social stereotyping, which in turn affects linguistic judgments (Fiske, Cuddy, &amp; Glick 2007). Nonstandard varieties are particularly subject to negative stereotypes, being evaluated as “less friendly” and “hard to understand” (Giles &amp; Watson 2013). In this study, we investigate attitudes towards Indian English, a variety of English spoken by one of the largest immigrant populations in the USA (approximately 2.4 million), to understand the roots of linguistic stereotyping towards this variety of English. We compared attitudes of American English speakers towards Indian English and British English. Our results show that while American English speakers do not explicitly indicate any communication problem with Indian English, they disfavor Indian English compared to British English.

Wild pigs were first introduced to the Canadian prairies in the 1980s and are now present in all Canadian provinces except those in the farthest east in Atlantic Canada (New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Newfoundland and Labrador). A telephone survey was conducted with 3007 rural Canadians in all ten provinces in order to quantify the level of awareness and concern regarding invasive wild pig impacts in their province. Rural Canadians have overall low awareness of the presence of wild pigs in their region. As expected, awareness of wild pigs was lowest in provinces where they were absent or rare (&lt;10% of respondents aware in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec, and Atlantic Canada), low in the two provinces where wild pigs are well established and relatively widespread in rural areas (22% of respondents aware in Alberta and Manitoba), and moderate awareness in the one province with by far the most expansive distribution of wild pigs (42% of respondents aware in Saskatchewan). In Atlantic Canada where there are no known wild pigs, 2% of respondents incorrectly indicated that they were aware of their presence. Concerns regarding impacts were overall moderate to low, with no province having a mean concern level ≥ 7 out of 10) for crop damage, livestock predation and harassment, structural damage, environmental impacts, threats to native wildlife, disease transmission to humans, or disease transmission to wildlife and livestock, and threats to human safety and well-being. Since rural Canadians experience the direct and indirect impacts from invasive wild pigs, our findings will inform management efforts and help to effectively engage rural Canadians in this rapidly emerging crisis. Communication and collaboration efforts through a range of conventional and social media are needed to help inform rural Canadians about the presence of wild pigs and the associated risks and impacts.

Some Preliminary Evidence from a Most Likely Case,"While universities play a key role in questions of free speech and political viewpoint diversity, they are often associated with the opposite of a free exchange of ideas: a proliferation of restrictive campus speech codes, violent protests against controversial speakers, and even the firing of inconvenient professors. For some observers these trends on university campuses are a clear indicator of the dire future for freedom of speech. Others view these incidents as scandalized singular events and regard the campus intolerance as a mere myth. We take an empirical look at some of the claims in the debate and present original survey evidence from a most likely case: the leftist social science studentship at Goethe University Frankfurt. Our results show that taking offense is a common experience and that a sizable share of students is in favor of restricting speech on campus. We also find evidence for conformity pressures on campus and that both, the desire to restrict speech and the reluctance to speak openly, differ significantly across political ideology. Students on the left are less likely to tolerate controversial viewpoints and students on the right are more likely to self-censor on politically sensitive issues such as gender, immigration or sexual and ethnic minorities.

Desde el enfoque de capacidades se ha valorado la proporción de población con insuficiencia alimentaria (PC1) y la proporción de la población sin acceso a agua potable ni servicio de saneamiento (PC2). Los resultados confirman que el gasto social es útil para explicar los cambios en la pobreza (PM1, PC1 y PC2), ya que existe una alta correlación negativa y significativa entre las variables antes y después de controlar para factores demográficos y cíclicos.

Qualitative research is dedicated to the analysis and observation of studens’ Facebook group page. The results showed that Students confirm that Facebook is a useful tool to distribute and share academic knowledge yet there are still many obstacles that hinder its use at the university context. On another hand, the present research suggests some helping solutions to enhance Facebook educational use among university students and their teachers.

The subject has been raised in an English-speaking country milieu (United States of America), while she has been used to speaking Arabic at home. In this regard, the paper highlights the aim of the encoded usage of code-switching utterances in term of addressing the monolingual brain hypothesis. This qualitative study is based on open observations of two continues months of a toddler as the participant of this study aiming at exploring whether children’s greeting differ from those of adults and whether this greeting differs between two languages with regard to monolingual brain hypotheses. So far, the study concluded that greeting has never been mixed upon context, though utterances are code-switched. Moreover, the greeting process is comprehended and acquired within the language context as a pragmatic speech act regarding greeter’s identity, context, and gender. Findings of this study significantly support the cognitive approach in term of greeting via using a high frequent greeting word among the American culture. As would cognitive linguists suggest, greeting speech act response varies regarding how greeters of each community greet the subject, but not how they greet each other’s in a community. Therefore, surprisingly the two-year-old subject perceptually recognizes the fact of receiving two different languages regardless to the monolingual hypothesis.",TRUE,FALSE,Bilingual|case study|code-switched greeting|monolingual brain hypothesis,2019-07-20T21:45:04.662154,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/citation/,kf89q,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa59eb2aa0d90019d2a84c/,5caa59eb2aa0d90019d2a84c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kf89q/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kf89q/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kf89q,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There were some variations in the use of some devices; in that certain devices were used at a very high rate of frequency compared to others.

There is great interest in the relationship between paid and unpaid labor time. Yet, in the United States most studies have focused on the housework component of unpaid labor. Limited research has examined how parental employment status relates to child care time. This study examines how unemployment is related to time in multiple types of child care and how this relationship varies by gender.
Methods
I use data from the 2003-2013 American Time Use Surveys to study cohabiting and married parents ages 18-65 (N=44,198). I predict time spent in total child care, routine child care, and educational/recreational child care by parental unemployment status using ordinary least squares and seemingly unrelated regression models, and examine differences between weekday and weekend time use. 
Results
Consistent with time-based theories, I find unemployed parents spend more time in child care than employed parents, but patterns vary by gender: unemployed mothers and fathers spend more time in child care on weekdays, but unemployed fathers spent less time in child care on weekends. 
Conclusions
Results suggest similarities and differences between the unemployment-child care time relationship and the relationship of unemployment with other types of unpaid labor such as housework.",TRUE,FALSE,child care|family demography|gender and family|household labor|unemployment|work and family,2019-01-23T02:54:21.521372,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nr9m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nr9m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nr9m/citation/,6nr9m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nr9m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nr9m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nr9m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c47ab7b2e57200017ffce1f/,5c47ab7b2e57200017ffce1f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nr9m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nr9m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6nr9m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6nr9m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6nr9m,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Protest Behaviour of the 1989 Generation in Europe,"Many studies suggest that citizens of Central and Eastern Europe are less politically active than their peers in Western Europe. Yet, it is unclear whether previous experiences of mobilization moderate these differences. This article focuses on the protest behaviour of the 1989 generation, which is composed of citizens who reached political maturity during the collapse of communism. Building on political socialization theory, the article proposes that citizens exposed to high levels of protest during their formative years might be more inclined to protest later. This implies that mobilization during the transitions from communism might moderate the current East-West gap in participation. The article combines data from 25 new and old democracies to assess how early exposure to protest has affected the participation of the 1989 generation. The results of multilevel models indicate that participation in demonstrations is not significantly lower in Central and Eastern Europe once we account for the level of protest at the turn of the nineties. Furthermore, the Eastern deficit in participation in petitions and boycotts is lower in societies that experienced higher levels of protest during the collapse of communism. Some results, however, are sensitive to the inclusion of Eastern Germany, an influential case.",TRUE,FALSE,democratization|generations|legacies|political participation|political socialization|post-communism|protest,2019-02-12T15:46:43.876601,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Philippe Joly,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcuws/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcuws/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcuws/citation/,kcuws,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcuws/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcuws/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcuws/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c61742a832ca6001aac6d25/,5c61742a832ca6001aac6d25,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcuws/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcuws/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kcuws/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kcuws/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kcuws,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Paid parental benefits policies are explicitly aimed to encourage return-to-work and enhance infant health. However, some recent policies also aim to equalize housework and paid work within families by earmarking weeks of parental benefits for fathers that cannot be transferred to mothers. We examine two theoretical frameworks from sociology and economics to highlight potential mechanisms through which such policies may increase or decrease union dissolution, and why the direction and magnitude of the effects might differ across subpopulations. Then, using population-level administrative data, we examine how the Quebec Parental Insurance Program affected union dissolution. We find that overall, the policy decreased the divorce/separation rate by 0.6% points, a 7% reduction in the rate overall (intent-to-treat). Further, we find that the effect of fathers using parental benefits on the risk of divorce (treatment-on-treated) is more than double the intent-to-treat estimate. The policy had the greatest effects in reducing union dissolution among couples likely to be more egalitarian in orientation, and led to no increase in divorce, even in the most traditional couples.",TRUE,FALSE,divorce|family|gender equality|parental leave|policy,2019-07-25T18:59:22.210738,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,Rachel Margolis|Youjin Choi|Anders Holm|Nirav Mehta,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/citation/,kqfd7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d39d366eb4caa0018999437/,5d39d366eb4caa0018999437,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kqfd7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kqfd7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kqfd7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite the relevance of citizenship policy to immigrant integration, we lack a reliable understanding of the economic consequences of acquiring citizenship. To overcome non-random selection into naturalization, we exploit the quasi-random assignment of citizenship in Swiss municipalities that held referendums to decide the outcome of individual naturalization applications. Our data combines individual-level referendum results with detailed social security records from the Swiss authorities. This allows us to compare the long-term earnings of otherwise similar immigrants who barely won or lost their referendum. We find that winning Swiss citizenship in the referendum increased annual earnings by an average of approximately 5,000 U.S. dollars over the subsequent 15 years.

I argue that social structures and hierarchies embedded in the capitalist system and the state’s social control over the racialized poor are not suspended even in places that appear governed by civility and tolerance, such as those under Anderson’s “cosmopolitan canopy”. Durable inequality, residential segregation, nativism, and racism inevitably shape what happens in diverse public spaces. Using an ethnographic study of an urban farmers’ market in New York City, I show that appearances of everyday cosmopolitanism, tolerance, and pleasure in difference coexist with conflict and reproduction of inequalities that are inextricable because the space is embedded within larger structures, institutions, and cultural paradigms.

Self-nudging applies insights from behavioral science in a way that is practicable and cost-effective but that sidesteps concerns about paternalism or manipulation. It has the potential to expand the scope of application of behavioral insights from the public to the personal sphere (e.g., homes, offices, families). It is a tool for reducing failures of self-control and enhancing personal autonomy; specifically, self-nudging can mean designing one’s proximate choice architecture to alleviate the effects of self-control problems, engaging in education to understand the nature and causes of self-control problems, and employing simple educational nudges to improve goal attainment in various domains. It can even mean self-paternalistic interventions such as winnowing down one’s choice set by, for instance, removing options. Policy makers could promote self-nudging by sharing knowledge about nudges and how they work.

Exploring Ireland’s Vegan and Vegetarian Foodscape,"While it would not be accurate to suggest that Ireland is a hub of veganism or vegetarianism, too often it is written off as inherently unsympathetic to the ethics of plant-based eating and anti-speciesist politics. While it is true that Irish culture is historically tied to speciesism and its economy is especially dependent upon “meat” and dairy production, Ireland’s relationship with other animals is complex and sometimes forgiving. This essay seeks to bring shape to the Irish vegan ethic, one that can be traced along its history of animism, agrarianism, ascendency, adaptation, and activism. From its pagan roots to its legacy of vegetarianism, Ireland’s history has been more receptive to Nonhuman Animal interests than might be currently understood. Its contributions to the modern Nonhuman Animal rights movement and developments in green agriculture must also be taken into account. More than a land of “meat” and potatoes, Ireland exists as a relevant, if overlooked, participant in Western vegan thought.",TRUE,FALSE,Animal nationalism|Animal rights|Climate Change|Consumption|Critical Animal Studies|Food|Food History|Green Tourism|Irish nationalism|Irish studies|Nationalism|Veganism|Vegetarianism,2019-05-03T14:22:06.801710,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-03,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,Corey Wrenn,2015,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/citation/,t83yg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccaf4f9bbbd37001aa2dbdc/,5ccaf4f9bbbd37001aa2dbdc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t83yg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t83yg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t83yg,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we study how investment capacity, defined as the resources remaining after the municipality perform the mandatory expenditures, influences elections in Brazil. We theorize that when a politician wins the election, this generates commitment problems in low investment capacity municipalities, as new mayors are unable to reward the firms that contributed to their campaigns. We test these claims by considering a close-elections regression discontinuity design coupled with heterogeneous quantile effects for Brazilian municipalities between 2000 and 2012. We find that incumbent mayors in towns with low investment capacity receive less campaign donation afterward and are more disadvantaged in their reelection contests. The results are robust to design variations and changes in party labels or mayoral characteristics.

Specifically, I hypothesize that individual income increases with hierarchical power, as does the share of individual income earned from capitalist sources. I test this idea using evidence from US CEOs, as well as a numerical model that extrapolates the CEO data. The results indicate that income tends to increase with hierarchical power, as does the capitalist composition of income.

I study how a newly salient manifestation of this pressure, reduced reporting capacity, influences political coverage. Focusing on newspapers in the United States, where industry-wide employment fell over 40% between 2007 and 2015, I use panel data to assess the relationship between reporting capacity and political coverage. Staff cuts substantially decrease the amount of political coverage newspapers provide. Across different samples and measurement approaches, a typical cutback to a newspaper's reporting staff reduces its annual political coverage by between 300 and 500 stories. These political news declines happen against the backdrop of similar reductions in non-political coverage, meaning the share of newspaper articles focused on politics remains stable over this period.

This paper aims to investigate the preceded causes of students’ spelling errors. The main research question sought to be answered is: What are the causes of spelling errors made by the Saudi university students?  The research participants were 15 students in the English Language Department at Tabuk University and 15 English language lecturers from the same department. Group structured interviews were designed for the lecturers and students. The findings reveal that there are different causes of students’ spelling errors such as the education system and university syllabus, students’ learning attitude, and the interference between English and Arabic language. This paper concludes that the spelling errors which Saudi university students commit were caused by the negative impacts of their education system and syllabus, where the syllabus ignores the importance of spelling rules and techniques, and the interference between English and Arabic language when the learners refer to their mother tongue while writing in the English language. It is hoped that the findings revealed in this study will help the policymakers in taking necessary actions in improving the learning experience of Arab learners of English.

""To our community,"" the post begins, ""On our journey to connect the world, we often discuss products we're building and updates on our business. Today I want to focus on the most important question of all: are we building the world we all want?"" Zuckerberg goes on to propose how Facebook can shape an equitable future, explaining how, ""In times like these, the most important thing we at Facebook can do is develop the social infrastructure to give people the power to build a global community that works for all of us."" This is a radically optimistic and persuasive agenda, and if one were to focus solely on the efforts of community building, then one might not be compelled to consider how, in fact, Facebook will achieve its future vision. Omitted from this sanguine future narrative is any mention whatsoever of data as its key asset. The basic work Facebook does is to collect data and to hold on to it for a long time, if not forever.

tqzp6,preprints,2019-10-08,2019-10-09,2019-10-08,NA,NA,“Swinging Pendulum”: Lives of Family Members Caring for A Dying Relative,"Among cultures which place emphasis on the centrality of family in ones lives, the care for the dying patient is more often than not delegated on family members. Given this context, it is interesting to note that few research have been done on the experiences of these individuals who provide care to their dying relatives.
     This research aims to understand the lives of these informal carers as they provide care to their dying relatives. After securing clearance from an IRB, seven (5) informants, deemed as coresearchers, were recruited and agreed to participate in this study. The co-researchers where selected based on a pre-set criteria and the number were reached based on theoretical saturation. Multiple individual in-depth face-to-face interviews were done to create the individual narratives which was later reflectively analysed. Interpretive phenomenology as espoused by van Manen served as the philosophical underpinning of the study. Consequently, the proposed analytic technique of van Manen was utilized as the process of reflective analysis.
     After the process of reflective analysis, three (3) themes were gathered, namely: Ambivalence in anticipation, Courage in uncertainty, Meaning in suffering. These themes represent for the co-researchers their lives as they care for their dying relatives. Further, these themes reflects for the co-researchers a phenomenon of living moment-to-moment, unsure of what tomorrow will bring, patiently waiting for their relative to cross over. For them, there seems to be a constant struggle of finding a reason for being and a sense of what has happened, what is happening and what could happen to their dying relative and their family after their death. This essence can be symbolically represented by a swinging pendulum, constantly in motion trying to situate ambivalence in their anticipation, looking for courage amidst uncertainty and finding for

How ethnic origin shapes friendship, dislike, and physical violence relations in German secondary schools","This study examines the role of ethnic background for friendship, dislike, and violence networks in secondary school. We analyze data on multiple networks from a large-scale study of more than 2500 seventh-graders in Germany. In addition to ethnic homophily in friendship networks, our results reveal a tendency among students to dislike ethnic outgroup members (ethnic heterophobia). However, students are more likely to engage in violence towards same-ethnic peers than outgroup members. This is partly due to the greater prevalence of violence among students who are close in the friendship network and students who spend time together outside of school. Moreover, schools marked by stronger ethnic homophily in friendships tend to display higher levels of ethnic heterophobia but exhibit higher levels of intra-ethnic rather than inter-ethnic violence.",TRUE,FALSE,bullying|dislike|Ethnic homophily|ethnic segregation|Exponential random graph models|integration paradox|Multiplex networks|Multivariate meta-analysis|negative ties|schools|school violence|Violence,2019-09-29T02:26:44.950881,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-29,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6kj5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6kj5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6kj5/citation/,h6kj5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6kj5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6kj5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6kj5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8fa1214ab86b001bf307e4/,5d8fa1214ab86b001bf307e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6kj5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6kj5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h6kj5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h6kj5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h6kj5,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.socnet.2019.04.004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The research has involved individual in-depth semi-structured interviews with six English Foreign Language (EFL) teachers and six students to further explore key issues from their viewpoints. The main findings have unveiled that both teachers and students recognise the motivating potential of all the examined scales. Many similarities and some dissimilarities related to specific motivational themes have emerged. In terms of dissimilarity, students accorded importance to group work scale, however teachers minimised its role by justifying that it needed certain conditions. Another area of mismatch can be noticed in the way students and teachers regarded tasks in motivating students. Teachers stressed on providing clear instruction and explanation while students pointed to the content of tasks. Furthermore, another instance of difference in participants’ views towards the same scale in terms of the motivational strategies to be used was in teacher behaviour scale.

We also elucidate how this cross-fertlization was mediated by the institutional structure of the university. We outline the role of key scholars such as Kenneth Arrow and Robert Wilson, as well as engineers turned administrators like Frederick Terman. We show that engineers largely drew upon successive economic theories of decision and allocation with a view to improving practical industrial management decisions. Reciprocally, economists found in engineering the tools (from linear programming to optimal control theory) they needed to rethink production and growth theory, an epistemology of “application” that emphasized awareness to institutional details, trials and errors and experiments to improve the design of processes and machines, and all sorts of industrial settings to operationalize their theories of decision, strategic interaction and bargaining. By the 2000s, they had turned into economic engineers designing markets and other allocation mechanisms. These cross-disciplinary exchanges were mediated by Stanford’s own institutional culture, notably its use of joint appointments, the development of multidisciplinary “programs” for students, the ability to attract a variety of visitors every year, the entrepreneurial and contract-oriented vision of its administrators, and the close ties with the industrial milieu that came to be called the Silicon Valley.",TRUE,FALSE,Arrow|economics|Engineering|History of Economics|History of Economic Thought|SocArXiv|Stanford,2019-04-19T00:10:41.476008,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,authors,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/citation/,adtbj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb8f615a3bc970018f5ada1/,5cb8f615a3bc970018f5ada1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/adtbj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/adtbj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/adtbj,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A Novel Test of Ethnic Competition Theory,"Whether labor market competition is shaping anti-immigration attitudes is a contentious issue. We conduct a novel test of ethnic competition theory by comparing the attitudes towards immigration of workers with fixed-term contracts to those with permanent jobs in Europe. Fixed-term contract workers are particularly at risk of competition as they have to compete for jobs in the foreseeable future. In the first step of our investigation, we analyze cross-sectional data (ESS, 2002–18) from 18 Western European countries. We find that—contrary to our expectation—fixed-term workers are less anti-immigration. The effect is substantively small.

The family income supplement (FIS) is an Irish IWB, introduced at a time of rapid societal change.

We discuss FIS in the context of changes to family life and social policy. We then outline the results of ten interviews with experts using three themes: work-first approach; child poverty and encouraging care.
Our analysis shows that policymakers faced new challenges to provide an income support for children while also promoting full-time labour participation.

In supporting this, there is a need to establish a decision-making and management system that involves the views and opinions of different stakeholders and unifies the goals of SIA amongst them. The objective of this work is to identify and describe pathways toward farm-level SIA. An explanatory network approach and fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) support the analysis of stakeholder views across the three pillars of sustainability: social, economic and environmental. Different stakeholder groups were asked to collectively map the pathways towards farm level SIA in a workshop exercise. The respective groups considered a common set of pre-selected factors as potential descriptors of sustainability and created unique maps by adding their own components and descriptors and identifying causal links between them. While the relative weighting of factors by each group differed, according to their perspectives and interpretation, yield, knowledge transfer, water quality, weather extremes and technology/infrastructure were scored as priority descriptors of farm-level sustainability by all groups in an aggregate analysis. Exploratory analysis of FCMs was found to provide an efficient mechanism to investigate stakeholder views on pathways towards farm-level SIA, by identifying causal relationships and interactions between factors and actors that affect its achievement. The study shows that sustainable intensification is a complex dynamic system that includes institutional structures, personal goals, stakeholder interests and socio-economic factors, and is affected by cognitive beliefs and particular knowledge within stakeholder groups. Our results show how experience, knowledge and beliefs affect the perception of farm-level SIA by various stakeholder groups, and how this knowledge is often fragmented and miscommunicated. The exercise confirmed the hypothesis that farm-level SIA has to be seen as a dynamic process in which farm performance is affected by various factors, with the complexity of the process increasing when different stakeholder interests and beliefs combine for farm management.",TRUE,FALSE,fuzzy cognitive mapping|group thinking|mental models|network analysis|stakeholder engagement|sustainable intensification,2019-09-10T15:19:23.493077,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics,Evgenia Micha|Owen Fenton|Karen Daly|Gabriella Kakonyi|Golnaz Ezatti|Thomas Moloney|Steven F.

The conclusion is sobering: Among existing energy sources, Solar power and nuclear fission are most promising. However, without the (rapid) development of space-based Solar power and nuclear fusion technologies, humankind might not be able to sustain extraterrestrial habitats - humankind might go extinct if we do not develop new sources of energy quickly enough.

Effectively, the present study attempts to answer three main research questions, namely 1. Can rule-based phonology provide a satisfactory account of non-assimilatory processes such as epenthesis and deletion in Mostaganem Spoken Arabic?  2. Can a syllable-devoid account of epenthesis and deletion in Mostaganem Spoken Arabic be satisfactory? 3. Is the syllable indispensable in accounting for epenthesis and deletion in Mostaganem Spoken Arabic? Indeed, the present study demonstrates that a syllable-devoid analysis provides unsatisfactory accounts of certain phonological epenthesis and deletion. In order to attain the aim of this study, instances of epenthesis and deletion in the Mostaganem spoken variety of Algerian Arabic are analysed. Such instances of epenthesis and deletion were obtained from the recorded speech of a randomly selected sample of fifty native speakers of Mostaganem Spoken Arabic. The findings of this study reveal the indispensability of the syllable in describing and explaining epenthesis and deletion in MTG by comparing a syllable-devoid account and a syllable-based account of such processes. Effectively, syllable-devoid account pertaining to The Sound Pattern of English (Chomsky&amp;Halle, 1968) tradition proved short of explanations as to why epenthesis and deletion take place in Mostaganem spoken Arabic as contrasted to a syllable-based account which provides adequate and convincing explanations of those processes.",TRUE,FALSE,Account|deletion|epenthesis|Mostaganem Spoken Arabic|phonological processes|syllable|The Sound Pattern of English,2019-07-18T16:01:21.396168,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/citation/,e9k7z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bf4b345253a001c41cb1c/,5d2bf4b345253a001c41cb1c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e9k7z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e9k7z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e9k7z,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.32,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

His ideas about Islam from within the Muslim circle attempt to transform and renew concepts of the God-creation relationship. Important, yet not unique, this book offers ideas similarly expressed by intellectuals like Amina Wadud, Farid Esack, Nasr Hamid Abu Zayd, Fazlur Rahman, and Muhammad Arkoun. Religion remains meaningful only when it manages to keep up with the social transformations affecting its members. Religion essentially needs to be constantly rethought, just as Khorchide attempts to achieve with this book. His thoughts are not without ambiguities and can certainly be challenged on several levels. But in the end, this is what the author calls for with his support for spiritual freedom and independent reasoning. This work makes an intriguing read for all who are interested in alternative streams of Islamic theology, specifically those trends emerging in the European university landscapes. There exists no justification for denouncing and rejecting these drafts as 'only products of the West'. Most Muslim reform scholars originate or have lived a considerable time in Muslim societies.

Family theories hypothesize that disruption of household routines and reduction in household resources link family instability to poorer child well-being. Recent research reveals that maternal partnership transitions represent a small fraction of the household instability children experience. These other forms of household instability might also be consequential for child well-being. The goal of this study is to determine whether household instability involving non-parental household members in children’s households is associated with changes in children’s educational outcomes using longitudinal data available in the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).

countries have led to a significant convergence in their positions on regional
security challenges. Active cooperation, however, remains constrained by a
number of factors, including India’s need to prioritize foreign policy challenges
closer to home, concerns about provoking China, and a discomfort among countries
in Southeast Asia regarding the idea of a joint U.S.-India approach toward the

The literature shows that phenotype has statistically significant effects on educational attainment, wages, job prestige, and other life outcomes; further those with more European phenotypes generally have more favorable life outcomes. These differences are obscured when Latino is used as a unit of analysis, suggesting that Latino is not a viable unit of analysis. Using Latino as a unit of analysis serves to misallocate resources intended to benefit victims of racial discrimination to Latinos with European phenotypes, as well as hiding the impact of discrimination on those with African or Amerindian phenotypes. The origin of Latino as a political term that attempted to distance and at the same time bring its members closer to whiteness makes its failure as a scientific tool unsurprising.

Crowdfunding activity helps to resolve the problem of fund scarcity; especially for small entrepreneurs. Social Media and the Internet are the powerful tools for the effective implementation of crowdfunding. The present research paper is the thorough study on the term crowdfunding. The specific area chosen for the research is the correlation between the exposure of crowdfunding activity and the response of the people to this activity. The hypothesis for the research was that there is a positive correlation between these two phenomena. The extensive research was conducted on the base of two types of information; primary data and secondary data. Some sociology and mass media theories were also analyzed in context of crowdfunding.
According to the findings from literature review and conducted surveys, it is concluded that the hypothesis supports the research question. If proper exposure is given to the crowdfunding campaign, it is effective in generating funds for some social or economic purposes.

Based on the error-analysis carried out by recent research, subject–verb agreement (SVA) is one of the most frequent errors committed by students. To overcome this problem, teachers should significantly improve students’ mastery of SVA in the English language through effective teaching methods. Therefore, this research was conducted to explore the effects of Kagan Cooperative Learning Structures in teaching SVA among rural Sarawak learners. In this study, 35 Form 4 students were selected from a secondary school in the Belaga District, Sarawak as the research participants. Questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used as data collection tools. Overall, findings demonstrated that students showed positive feedback after the intervention was implemented.

Economic and technological advances have led to a more interconnected global community, further increasing the need for considerations of human mobility. While data on human mobility are better recorded in many developed countries, availability of such data remains limited in many low- and middle-income countries around the world, particularly at the fine temporal and spatial scales required by many applications. In this study, we used 5-year census-based internal migration microdata for 32 departments in Colombia (i.e., Admin-1 level) to develop a novel spatial interaction modeling approach for estimating migration, at a finer spatial scale, among the 1,122 municipalities in the country (i.e., Admin-2 level). Our modeling approach bridges a significant gap in the availability of migration data at administrative unit levels finer than those at which migration data are typically recorded. Due to the widespread availability of census-based migration microdata at the Admin-1 level, our modeling approach opens up for the possibilities of modeling migration patterns at Admin-2 and Admin-3 levels across many other countries where such data are currently lacking.",TRUE,FALSE,Colombia|disease transmission|human mobility|migration|spatial scales,2019-10-08T01:36:42.748868,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-08,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/citation/,avw7z,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/74mg8/,74mg8,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d9bc3ebfcf91f0010191377/,5d9bc3ebfcf91f0010191377,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/avw7z/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/avw7z/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/avw7z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study incorporates the newest education polygenic score (Lee et al. 2018) into sociological research, and tests three gene-environment interaction hypotheses on status attainment. Using the Health and Retirement Study (N = 7,625), I report three findings. First, a standard deviation increase in the education polygenic score is associated with a 60% increase in the likelihood of advancing to the next level of education, while a standard deviation increase in parental education results in a 68% increase. Second, supporting the Saunders hypothesis, the genetic effect becomes 11% smaller when parental education is one standard deviation higher, indicating that highly educated parents are more able to preserve their family’s elite status in the next generation. Finally, the genetic effect is slightly greater for the younger cohort (1942~59) than the older cohort (1920~41).

The major units of production, such as land, labor, and technology, have a statistically positive relationship with paddy production. Among the climatic variables, rainfall and the number of rainy days show a statistically significant and positive relationship but temperature shows a negative relationship with paddy production.

Specifically, the research focuses on the attitudes of patients and staff towards communicating in English instead of Arabic, which is the primary official language in Saudi Arabia. First, the study addresses the question of how the dominance of English language in the selected medical context affects service delivery. Second, the study explores the attitude of patients and medical staff towards the dominance of the English language. Third, the study presents a comparison of the attitude of patients and medical staff towards the use of English language. Finally, the study responds to the question of how patients' level of education influences their attitude towards the use of English at the hospital. The study is based on quantitative research, involving 60 participants, where 30 patients and 30 medical staff. The findings reveal that 86.7% of medical staff members find it challenging to communicate with their patients in English. On the same note, 60% of patients interviewed admitted that they find it difficult understanding medical practitioners when they communicate in English. The findings can have significant practical implications since they show a possible communication barrier that can be addressed to improve patient experience at Bisha King Abdullah Hospital. The findings provide statistical evidence to inform evidence-based strategies to improve communication between patients and medical practitioners at the hospital.

Both standard economic labour theories and sociological theories presume that the effect of public childcare provision varies with mothers’ educational attainment. The analysis links county-level data on annual childcare ratios with individual-level data from the Socio-Economic Panel Study (2007-2016). To match mothers with similar characteristics in counties with childcare ratios above and below the annual median within East and West Germany, entropy balancing is applied. Findings indicate a positive relationship between childcare provision and maternal employment, with more pronounced associations for mothers with at least a vocational degree, those with a second birth, and those who receive full-time access to childcare.",TRUE,FALSE,balancing|childcare|educational inequality|family policy|maternal employment|socioeconomic background,2019-11-21T17:13:42.517275,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-21,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt5yk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt5yk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt5yk/citation/,pt5yk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt5yk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt5yk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt5yk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd6741282d216000e542547/,5dd6741282d216000e542547,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt5yk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt5yk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pt5yk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pt5yk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pt5yk,https://doi.org/10.1177/0958928719892843,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I identify four distinct viral strategies that vary according to the number of belief systems used, and whether the viral message confirmed or contradicted central beliefs.  Finally, I use information systems modeling to depict a common viral mechanism underlying the strategies. I conclude with a practical heuristic to guide the design of nanoviral messages.

Equally, such interactions are consequential for social capital, and may  be a dimension of cultural fit. Thus processes of status attainment and resource allocation may vary across workplaces in concert with their sociability. Using a new measure of time spent with coworkers, constructed using the American Time Use Survey, this paper shows that work explains a great deal more variation in sociability between coworkers than individual characteristics. The extent of shared workplace identities, influenced by occupational competition levels and union membership, and incentives to socialize are two important mechanisms in this process. Moreover, norms and expectations of appropriate behavior in the workplace accompany occupational differences in sociability, and matching these expectations is consequential for workers' earnings.",TRUE,FALSE,coworkers|cultural fit|occupations|organizations|sociability|social interactions|work,2019-06-26T09:59:43.563437,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-26,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/citation/,vs6hw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d109073e200da00176e896b/,5d109073e200da00176e896b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs6hw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vs6hw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vs6hw,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It applies hybrid mixed effects regression models that partition between- and within-person variation to estimate parental savings and financial assets over time and across different households. The results suggest that coresidence with adult children led to decreases in parental assets and savings. In the years in which their children lived at home, parents held 24% less in financial assets and 23% less in savings compared to years when adult children were not present.

Results provide a preview of the significant differences in Gahagan biface morphology expressed between the southern Caddo area and central Texas regions. The size discrepancy represents an inversion of current theoretical constructs that posit a decrease in tool size thought to articulate with an increase in distance from the raw material source.

347zn,preprints,2019-12-05,2019-12-19,2019-12-05,NA,NA,The Pleasure Principle: Why (Some) People Develop a Taste for Politics,"Often, citizens talk politics or watch political shows solely for the pleasure they derive from these activities. Yet, existing theories struggle to explain why (some) individuals engage with politics as an end in itself even if the behavior does not produce any separable instrumental value. Integrating psychological theories from motivation studies, this study deduces a need-based model of political motivation in order to explain intrinsic political engagement. The model proposes that intrinsic political motivation has roots in the seemingly apolitical processes of need satisfaction which are deeply ingrained in the human psyche. Providing a theoretical framework for existing political science findings, this study argues that citizens seek behaviors they previously experienced as pleasurable. Differences in intrinsic political motivation are therefore theorized to reflect whether political engagement was previously experienced as satisfying basic psychological needs which is argued to predict both whether and how individuals engage with politics. By manipulating need-related situational features before and during political engagement, a pre-registered survey experiment tested the basic tenet that need-related experiences with politics affect the quality and quantity of future activities in the political domain. However, 15 out of 15 analytical tests do not yield the expected evidence in line with the need-based model of political motivation. Showcasing a step-wise approach for dealing with null-results in hypothesis-driven research to assess and increase the information value of the conducted analysis, the presented evidence calls into question the accuracy of the presented theory and the previous insights in psychology and political science on which it was built. This study thus adds a new piece to the puzzle of understanding what does and what does not underlie intrinsic motivation for political engagement.",TRUE,FALSE,Civic Engagement|Cognitive Processing|Expectancy Value Theory|Motivation Studies|Open Science|Political Participation|Rational Choice Theory|Self-determination theory,2019-12-05T18:18:02.530772,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-05,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/citation/,347zn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/7m4gd/,7m4gd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de92a1884c479000b78654f/,5de92a1884c479000b78654f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/347zn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/347zn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/347zn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This finding, however, can depict people of color or poor people as more prejudiced than White, middle-class families. In this 18-month ethnographic study, the author complicates this rejection paradigm through documenting the narratives of 40 LGBTQ youth experienc- ing homelessness. The author examines how poverty and family instability shaped the con- ditions that the youth perceived as their being rejected because of their gender and sexuality.

However, the validity of the instrument has been barely assessed. The current study addressed the concurrent and content validity of four popular MAS items (justifiability of homosexuality, suicide, prostitution, and euthanasia). A sample of 493 Russians completed both MAS and the four validated multi-item scales. Results demonstrated that, except for the homosexuality item, the MAS items had low concurrent validity, explaining less than 50% of the variance of the corresponding multi-item scales. The MAS items underestimated the justifiability of homosexuality, prostitution, and suicide, and overestimated the justifiability of euthanasia. The MAS homosexuality item appeared to be a precise measure of attitude towards male (but not female) homosexuality, responses to the prostitution and suicide items overlooked the positive arguments, and the euthanasia item tapped more into attitudes towards euthanasia of a dying person. The four items showed strong dependence on the overall justifiability. We conclude that separate MAS items should be used with caution, given the detected content bias and the items’ strong link to non-specific overall justifiability.",TRUE,FALSE,Concurrent validity|European Values Study|Justifiability|Moral Attitudes Scale,2019-04-11T16:44:44.361038,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr86y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr86y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr86y/citation/,hr86y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr86y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr86y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr86y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cade571e3915600175eea32/,5cade571e3915600175eea32,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr86y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr86y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hr86y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hr86y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hr86y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

An inferentialist account of computer simulation,"The dual problems of how an idealized model can represent and provide information about its target have become a central topic of in the philosophy of science. We argue that several current views are misguided in assuming that the epistemology of modeling and simulation must build on a philosophical theory of the representation relation (e.g. isomorphism, similarity). We extend Robert Brandom’s inferentialist account of meaning into scientific representation to argue that representational language is explicatory, not explanatory, in nature. We provide a broader philosophical rationale for inferential accounts of scientific representation, and an epistemologically modest account of the role of models in terms of inferential scorekeeping. We apply these views to the contested case of computer simulations to argue that, although the praxis of simulation modeling resembles that of scientific experimentation, simulations alone cannot lead to genuinely novel discoveries about the world, as they are merely tools for keeping our reasoning straight.",TRUE,FALSE,computer simulation|inferentialism|scientific representation|similarity,2019-06-04T11:27:42.681708,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cf4|5a8c80f5c698300375c76cfc|Arts and Humanities|Philosophy|Philosophy of Science,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/citation/,v9bmr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf62a07b700fa001b9fede6/,5cf62a07b700fa001b9fede6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/v9bmr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/v9bmr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/v9bmr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We used semi-structured interviews with 27 academic, management and professional staff at the University of Edinburgh to explore the life cycles of selected projects and centres from planning and preparation through to decommissioning. We observed the degree to which pursuit of challenge-led opportunities induced the emergence of new project-level organizational forms or changed academics’ modus operandi from “Mode 1” research to “Mode2” knowledge production.  We further explored the levels of management input and administrative support expected and received by the project organization from its host academic schools, colleges the university. We found that the size, complexity and disciplinary, interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary scope of the initiatives influenced their emergence as autonomous project organisations. “Role strain” affected many respondents as they sought to balance Mode 1 academic and Mode 2 leadership and management roles in their project organizations.  Further exploration of the distribution of leadership management and professional support functions among project organizations and the support structures of academic schools, colleges and the university is warranted.  We suggest that the university might usefully act as a boundary organization and adopt a Mode 2 knowledge exchange mission in support of multi-stakeholder projects.

This chapter addresses the commitments which Georgia has imposed on itself, be that on the basis of unilateral acts or in the framework of an international agreement, and are aimed at approximating the Georgian law to that of the EU. Obviously, in this sense, commitments undertaken under the EU-Georgia Association Agreement are of great significance. The chapter explores Georgian approach to the EU law which is reflected in unilateral acts adopted by the Georgian lawmaker. Furthermore, particular attention is given over to commitments assumed under the EU-Georgia Association Agreement, especially to preserve and respect common values and to approximate Georgian laws to EU norms.

The conveniently selected participants were thirteen ESL learners and a native speaker of English instructor. Two data collection instruments were employed to gather the primary data for this research study. The first instrument was a student survey to explore the perceptions and beliefs of the students about MMCs. The second measure involved a set of semi-structured interviews with four students and their instructor. The results of the statistical data analysis of the student survey indicated that the majority of the student participants expressed their preference for using MMCs because this writing approach enabled them to more completely and professionally explain their meanings to others.

This paper argues that U-learning represents a new perspective in terms of pedagogy. The main contributor to this process is foremost the teacher, who has to adhere to the ever-changing language learning/teaching scenery. This study aims at setting the fundamentals of materials development at the intersection of two major areas of contemporary education, namely the needs of the ‘net generation’ students and the educational potential of the evolving social web and digital technology. It seeks to answer the following questions: What is digital technology and how does it lead to U-learning? What is web 2.0 and how does it affect classroom pedagogy, practice, and the design of quality teaching/learning materials? How does it help teachers improve their practice and materials development procedures? And how can teachers transform today’s innovative technology into ubiquitous learning experiences, promoting learner autonomy, regardless of any geographical or institutional boundaries?

Several criteria exist for measuring pairwise dissimilarities among sequences. Typically, dissimilarity matrices are employed as input to heuristic clustering algorithms, with the aim of identifying the most relevant patterns in the data.

Here, we propose a model-based clustering approach for categorical sequence data. The technique is applied to a survey data set containing information on the career trajectories of a cohort of Northern Irish youths tracked between the ages of 16 and 22.

Specifically, we develop a family of methods for clustering sequences directly, based on mixtures of exponential-distance models, which we call MEDseq. The use of the Hamming distance or weighted variants thereof as the distance metrics permits closed-form expressions for the normalising constant, thereby facilitating the development of an ECM algorithm for model fitting. Additionally, MEDseq models allow the probability of component membership to depend on fixed covariates. Sampling weights, which are often associated with life-course data arising from surveys, are also accommodated. Simultaneously including weights and covariates in the clustering process yields new insights on the Northern Irish data.",TRUE,FALSE,exponential-distance models|gating covariates|Life-course data|model-based clustering|sequence analysis|survey sampling weights|weighted Hamming distance,2019-12-05T18:08:01.342946,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-05,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/citation/,f5n8k,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de7c691e1e62f000a334c46/,5de7c691e1e62f000a334c46,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f5n8k/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f5n8k/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f5n8k,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that there was indeed an influx of people from regions north of the Black Sea or further east in the fourth century CE, but there is no indication of a large-scale migration from central Asia. It is possible that the climatic downturn and increased aridity in the 430s to 450s disrupted both the economic organisation of the incomers and that of the local Romanised population, requiring both to adopt new subsistence strategies.

Explaining the Use of Facebook News Posts as a Substitute for Other News Sources,"An increasing number of, especially younger, users use Facebook as their primary source for news about political and societal issues. At the same time, research suggests that Facebook use contributes to societal knowledge gaps. Against this background, we investigate the antecedents of using Facebook as a substitute for other news sources. We argue that exposure to news posts on Facebook increases the feeling of being well-informed, regardless of actual knowledge acquisition. This might lead users, especially those with a low need for cognition (NfC), to use Facebook as a substitute for other news sources. We test these assumptions with an online survey (n = 390) of German Internet users. Results show that the feeling of being well-informed through Facebook is reinforced by the quantity of exposure to news content on Facebook but not by the amount of actually read news posts. The feeling of being informed is an important predictor of using Facebook news as a substitute. High NfC interferes with this effect. It makes the substitution of other news sources less likely—but only for moderate to high levels of the feeling of being informed. We discuss these results in the light of their societal consequences.",TRUE,FALSE,Facebook|Feeling of Being Informed|Need for Cognition|News Exposure|Substitution,2019-04-17T13:39:27.908432,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Mass Communication,Philipp Müller|Svenja Schäfer|&amp; Pascal Schneiders,2016,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/citation/,cjz54,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb6273d3992690018152062/,5cb6273d3992690018152062,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cjz54/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cjz54/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cjz54,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chb.2016.09.003,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The expulsion of large numbers of Roma individuals, accompanied by other discriminatory practices and forms of hostility, exclusion and violence against the Roma across Europe, has brought the attention of the media and policy makers to Roma issues to a greater extent than ever before during the last decade. The range of problems still afflicting the lives of many Roma nowadays is extremely wide, well researched and profusely documented. This contribution leaves aside issues related to free movement and EU citizenship, thus moving the debate beyond the narrow framework of the ‘migrant Roma’. The contribution considers the wide range of relevant EU competences in this field, and assesses how comprehensive and appropriate the EU’s approach to Roma issues is. The analysis combines legal instruments, policy papers, and case law, draws from legal and non-legal literature, and integrates considerations of social, economic and cultural nature. In the process, this contribution considers themes that cut across several strands of the EU’s Roma policy, including fundamental rights, intercultural sensitivity, the limits of the ‘integration model’, and issues of enforcement, monitoring and funding. The logical narrative developed puts together the key jigsaw pieces that currently contribute to a EU Roma policy, and clearly identifies the limitations of the current state of affairs.

Introducing Agent-Based Models as a tool for linkage analysis,"Linkage analyses use data from panel surveys and content analyses to assess media effects under field conditions and are able to close the gap between experimental and survey-based media effects research. Results from current studies and simulations indicate, however, that these studies systematically under-estimate real media effects as they aggregate measurement errors and reduce the complexity of media content. In response to these issues, we propose a new method for linkage analysis which applies agent-based simulations to directly assess short-term media effects using empirical data as guideposts.
Results from an example study modeling opinion dynamics in the run-up of a Swiss referendum show that this method outperforms traditional regression-based linkage analyses in detail and explanatory power. In spite of the time-consuming modeling and computation process, this approach is a promising tool to study individual media effects under field conditions.",TRUE,FALSE,Agent Based Modeling|Linkage Analysis|Simulation,2019-07-19T17:06:02.110738,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Other Communication,Martin Wettstein|University of Zürich,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp4hm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp4hm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp4hm/citation/,gp4hm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp4hm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp4hm/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/uhv6e/,uhv6e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp4hm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d318ec4251f0e001905b970/,5d318ec4251f0e001905b970,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp4hm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp4hm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gp4hm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gp4hm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gp4hm,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study collected primary data based on a set of questionnaire survey among 134 executives and managers of GLCs in Malaysia. The data were collected based on opinions of the seven factors of entrepreneurial orientation practices by using the five-point Likert scale. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Further, the reliability of the data was tested using Cronbach’s alpha test, the validity of the data was tested by checking the normality test through skewness and kurtosis, and the consistency of the data was tested using factor analysis. On an average, 70.9% of the respondents agreed that they focus on these factors of entrepreneurial orientation. The federal owned GLCs place more emphasis on entrepreneurial orientation than the state owned GLCs. This study suggests improving the practices of entrepreneurial orientation of GLCs in Malaysia by emphasizing on recognizing individual risk takers for their willingness to champion new projects, whether it eventually turns out to be successful or not, encouraging employees to take calculated risks with new ideas, considering the term “risk taker” as a positive attribute for people in the organization, and supporting many small and experimental projects by realizing that some will undoubtedly fail.",TRUE,FALSE,entrepreneurial orientation|government linked companies|Malaysia|sustainable competitive advantage,2019-06-13T19:11:08.050934,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbq97/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbq97/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbq97/citation/,wbq97,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbq97/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbq97/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/b3u7x/,b3u7x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbq97/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d020b35760f11001afba6ba/,5d020b35760f11001afba6ba,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbq97/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbq97/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wbq97/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wbq97/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wbq97,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Nevertheless, how to shift population behaviour patterns in this way remains one of the greatest uncertainties for research and policy. Evidence about behaviour change interventions that are easier to evaluate tends to overshadow that for population- and system-wide approaches that generate and sustain healthier behaviours. Population health interventions are often implemented as natural experiments, which makes their evaluation more complex and unpredictable than a typical randomised controlled trial (RCT). We discuss the growing importance of evaluating natural experiments, and their distinctive contribution to the evidence for public health policy. We contrast the established evidence-based practice pathway, in which RCTs generate ‘definitive’ evidence for particular interventions, with a practice-based evidence pathway in which evaluation can help adjust the compass bearing of existing policy. We propose that intervention studies should focus on reducing critical uncertainties, that non-randomised study designs should be embraced rather than tolerated, and that a more nuanced approach to appraising the utility of diverse types of evidence is required. The complex evidence needed to guide public health action is not necessarily the same as that which is needed to provide an unbiased effect size estimate. The practice-based evidence pathway is neither inferior, nor merely the best available when all else fails.

We provide the first global overview of parental bereavement, its magnitude, prevalence, and distribution over age, for the 1950-2000 annual birth cohorts of women using a novel methodology from formal demography applied to data from the 2019 Revision of the United Nations World Population Prospects. We project that the global burden of parental bereavement will be 1.6 times lower for women born in the year 2000 than for women born in 1955. Accounting for compositional effects, we anticipate the largest improvements in regions of the Global South where offspring mortality continues to be a common life event. The paper quantifies an unprecedented shift in the timing of parental bereavement from reproductive to retirement ages. Starting with the 1985 cohort, women will be more likely to lose an adult child after age 65 than a young child before age 50, reversing a long-standing global trend. ""Child death"" will increasingly come to mean the death of adult offspring. We project persisting regional inequalities in offspring mortality and in the availability of children in later life, a particular concern for parents dependent on support from their children after retirement. Nevertheless, our analyses suggest a progressive narrowing of the historical gap between the Global North and South in the near future.

This approach overlooks perceptions of appropriate behavior for men and gender dynamics within families. We use nationally representative data of 12th-grade students from Monitoring the Future surveys (1976–2014) to evaluate changes in youths’ preferred division of labor arrangements. Over this period, contemporary young people exhibited greater openness to a variety of division of labor scenarios for their future selves as parents, although the husband-as-earner/wife-as-homemaker arrangement remained most desired. Using latent class analysis, we identify six configurations of gender attitudes: conventionalists, neo-traditionalists, conventional realists, dual-earners, intensive parents, and strong intensive parents.

Comparing Frame Occurrence in Online and Traditional News Media Reporting on Europe’s  “Migration Crisis”,"News media have transformed over the last decades, with rising online news suppliers and an increase in online news consumption. We examine how reporting on immigration differs between popular German online and print media over three crucial years of the so-called immigration crisis, from 2015 to 2017. This study extends knowledge on framing of the crisis by examining a period covering start, peak, and the time after the intake of refugees. Moreover, we establish whether online and print reporting differs in terms of both frame occurrence and variability. The period of the crisis provided an ideal test to see whether the focus of media reporting differed between online and print sources. Employing a most similar cases design based on (autonomous) online and print versions of three major German news outlets, we extract the dominant frames in almost 18,500 articles using algorithm-based topic modelling.

According to the cognitive linguistic approach, the stereotype is considered to be an element of the cultural and linguistic world view and an integral part of reality categorization mechanism. Ethnic stereotypes are very important in the process of intercultural communication since they can increase its effectiveness and eliminate interethnic problems or they can act vice versa. So auto- and hetero-stereotypes play a significant role in intercultural communication. This fact underlines the relevance of ethnic stereotype studies. The notions of ""auto- stereotype” and “hetero-stereotype"" are considered in the article, using the examples of English-language political media text headlines.

It presents a general analysis of the shortcomings of national legislation that limits the constitutional provisions for citizens of Ukraine to obtain the appropriate level of social protection. The article shows the problems of the status of internally
displaced persons (IDPs), which should provide for them additional guarantees from the state, including social ones. However, the carried out research shows that this status often becomes a discriminatory factor that imposes disproportionate restrictions on individuals. The current legal regulation of social payments for internally displaced persons contains a number of rigid and rather complicated administrative procedures that significantly restrict, and in some cases even generally make it impossible to obtain social protection. The only effective remedy for the protection of an infringed right for pensions or other social benefits for internally displaced persons is an appeal to a court. The courts do not always carry out effective and prompt protection of the violated law. Despite positive examples of judicial practice, it can not always provide an adequate and well-timed level of social protection, which causes the need for the improvement of national legislation.

Boundary work is scattered in programmatic manifestos, lectures, and speeches, and it can be found in historicism, philosophy, and not least in the natural sciences. Revealing how local boundary work brings about the Geisteswissenschaften as a stable and robust social entity, this essay tracks symbolic boundaries between the two cultures. The German case deviates from the usual two cultures narrative: Although a distinction between the two cultures is just as momentous, the boundary between them does not distinguish a literary from a scientific culture, but two scientific cultures. The analysis contributes to a historical sociology of the social sciences and humanities by highlighting the temporality, the situatedness and the relational character of boundary work.",TRUE,FALSE,Boundary Work|Geisteswissenschaften|History of Humanities|History of the Human Sciences|Humanities|Natural Sciences|Naturwissenschaften|Relational|Sociology of Science|Sociology of Scientific Knowledge|Two Cultures,2019-09-29T02:24:02.322750,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-29,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd1|Arts and Humanities|History|Intellectual History|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd6|Arts and Humanities|History|History of Science, Technology, and Medicine|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/citation/,zv3mf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8f1c57c43280001cc57001/,5d8f1c57c43280001cc57001,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zv3mf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zv3mf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zv3mf,https://doi.org/10.1086/696300,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is probably one of the most frequently asked questions in the history of human kind. Moral decisions can be very hard in particularly when people are just starting their adventure with an adult life, that is, in their early 20’s. This report shows the moral condition of academic youth from one of the most religious regions in Poland. Therefore, the focus of this study was to show the relationship between religion and morality of young Poles. This article presents the results of a survey study conducted among 139 students of the University of Rzeszow attending the 2006/2007 academic year. The results showed that the morality of surveyed students seems to depend in a high degree on circumstances of situations (i.e., moderate moral relativism) rather than absolute norms. Moreover, the comparison of the results of this study with previous questionnaire research conducted at the same institution in mid-90’s show that religion has smaller impact on moral choices of academic youth from Subcarpathia province.

Differentiated access to integration for asylum seekers in Germany,"This paper investigates the normative permissibility of differential inclusion policies, taking Germany as a case study. In the face of mounting asylum applications, Germany introduced new administrative rules differentiating access to integration for asylum seekers. The paper normatively examines whether this practice is consistent with two conventional liberal concepts: special obligations grounding the moral commitments of the liberal state towards its own citizens and the principle of legal certainty grounding its moral commitments towards everyone under its jurisdiction, including asylum seekers. Combining these two usually separately employed perspectives, it argues that while differential inclusion is in principle consistent with these liberal principles, the crude criterion of the country of origin does not comply with both perspectives.

It also aimed at showing that having no exposure to English language culture alongside learning the English language itself will affect learners' understanding and production of the language. In this light, the study attempts to answer the following questions: to what extent is the culture of the English language present in the lessons of English language that are introduced to secondary school students? What cultural background do secondary school students have about the English language? And if they do have any cultural background, what is the source of that background and whether culture teaching enhances EFL learners' socio-cultural competence? We hypothesised that teaching culture to Algerian EFL learners will increase their sociocultural competence and improve their understanding of the language. This hypothesis was tested through conducting a quasi-experimental study with a group of eighteen students from Habba Abd El-Madjid Secondary School in El-Meghaier, El-Oued (Algeria) The final results revealed a remarkable improvement among the majority of students concerning their sociocultural competence and their perception and understanding of authentic English language.

csfpy,preprints,2019-02-20,2019-02-20,2019-02-20,NA,NA,Luck as a Double-Edged Sword: Personnel and Performance Changes after Lucky Outcomes in the National Football League,"Luck is an omnipresent factor which influences experiences and outcomes for individuals and organizations. This article analyzes how lucky and unlucky outcomes influence future organizational learning, decision-making and performance. Team statistics and outcomes are analyzed over 769 National Football League seasons for 32 franchises from 1990-2015. Four specific sources of luck are identified and measured: 1) divergence of win outcomes from actual team quality; 2) difficulty of opposition; 3) fumble recovery rates and 4) player injuries. Teams and players have little or no influence over these lucky factors, which nevertheless influence game outcomes, and by extension, the careers of players and coaches. Luck alters game outcomes and in turn significantly influences the retention or firing of coaches and players, which shapes their career incentives and decision-making.

Using longitudinal data from a large commercially insured population, we construct a network where a tie between patients was weighted by the number of shared opioid prescribers. Given prior research suggesting that doctor shopping may be a social process, we hypothesize that active doctor shoppers will occupy central structural positions in this network. We show that network prominence, operationalized using PageRank, was associated with more opioid prescriptions, higher predicted risk for dangerous morphine dosage, opioid overdose, and opioid use disorder, controlling for number of prescribers and other variables. Moreover, as a patient’s own prominence increased over time, so did their risk for these outcomes, compared to their own average level of risk. These findings point to structural properties of co-prescription networks as a promising indicator of social or strategic drug-seeking behavior and overdose risk.",TRUE,FALSE,opioid epidemic|PageRank|Social network,2019-02-05T17:11:23.971208,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-05,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5v2z4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5v2z4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5v2z4/citation/,5v2z4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5v2z4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5v2z4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5v2z4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5888fa76653c001a24028b/,5c5888fa76653c001a24028b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5v2z4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5v2z4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5v2z4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5v2z4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5v2z4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Lessons from a Campaign Against Vote Buying in Uganda","We estimate the effects of one of the largest anti-vote-buying campaigns ever studied—with half a million voters exposed across 1427 villages—in Uganda’s 2016 elections. Working with civil society organizations, we designed the study to estimate how voters and candidates responded to their campaign in treatment and spillover villages, and how impacts varied with campaign intensity. Despite its heavy footprint, the campaign did not reduce politician offers of gifts in exchange for votes. However, it had sizable effects on people’s votes. Votes swung from well-funded incumbents (who buy most votes) towards their poorly-financed challengers. We argue the swing arose from changes in village social norms plus the tactical response of candidates.

Couples were more likely to report that one person managed the shared pot of money in countries with high gender inequality compared with couples in more gender equal countries. This pattern was not moderated by within-couple earnings equality. We found a cohabitation—marriage gap in income arrangements that is largest where national-level gender equality is high. In more gender equal contexts, married couples were more likely to pool and manage their money together, whereas a larger proportion of married couples assigned one money manager in countries with less gender equality. Cohabiting couples were more likely to keep some money separate than to take-up a pooled, jointly managed approach in more gender equal countries.

Sociologists, on the other hand, have extensively studied nationalism, but have only sporadically engaged in debates about institutional politics. In this study, we bring these literatures together by considering how nationalist beliefs shaped respondents' voting preferences in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and how the election outcome built on long-term changes in the distribution of nationalism in the U.S. population. The results suggest that competing understandings of American nationhood were effectively mobilized by candidates from the two parties, both in the 2016 primaries and the general election. Furthermore, over the past twenty years, nationalism has become sorted by party, as Republican identifiers have come to define America in more exclusionary and critical terms and Democrats have increasingly endorsed inclusive and positive conceptions of nationhood. These trends point to the rising demand for radical candidates among Republicans and suggests a potentially bleak future for U.S. politics, as nationalism becomes yet another among multiple overlapping social and cultural cleavages that serve to reinforce partisan divisions and undermine the stability of liberal democratic institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,2016 election|Clinton|cultural sociology|electoral politics|latent class analysis|national identity|nationalism|political communication|political sociology|populism|radical right|Sanders|Trump|word2vec|word embeddings,2019-08-16T14:51:01.914587,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-16,FALSE,NA,no,Data will be made available after publication.,NA,no,It is not customary to preregister non-experimental research in sociology.,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/citation/,pmg95,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d56bafeffde5b001affc26e/,5d56bafeffde5b001affc26e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pmg95/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pmg95/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pmg95,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We propose here both a new explanation for the endurance of these statements as well as an analysis of the power, limitations, and possibilities of aphorisms. By drawing from the critical scholarship concerned with aphorisms, we demonstrate that some of the allure of the classical sociological texts derives from their form, and particularly their reliance on the relative autonomy of the aphorism. Through examining Marx’s “opiate of the people,” Weber’s “iron cage,” and, briefly, two more contemporary sociological aphorisms, we suggest that aphorisms have an ambivalent role in sociological theory: they make claims memorable even as they potentially oversimplify complex arguments.

The standard historiography of clinical trials, at least in Britain, is built around the trial of streptomycin as a treatment for tuberculosis organised by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) in the late 1940s. A series of clinical trials took place in Glasgow in the 1930s which doesn’t feature in the standard account. The reasons for their exclusion, and why they did take place, are the subject of this paper.

In recovering the context in which the Glasgow clinical trials took place three factors stand out. Firstly, the practice operated by the Glasgow Corporation of treating most cases of skin infection by hospitalising patients. Secondly, the high degree of interconnectivity between voluntary and state-funded hospitals in Glasgow at the time. Thirdly, the belief of Thomas Anderson in the value of biometry as a basis for evaluating therapies.

These factors can be given names. The first is the moral economy of medicine - the practice of establishing fever and isolation hospitals as part of hospital provision in Glasgow in the nineteenth century.

It can be challenging for teacher educators to support teacher candidates in learning through these experiences when the records of practice are stored in audio or video files. This article discusses a portal being developed through design-based research to allow teacher educators to access and efficiently process records of teacher candidates’ performance from a digital simulation. A pilot study was conducted to see how two teacher educators used a prototyped portal to plan and facilitate a post-simulation debriefing with five teacher candidates, and to identify additional opportunities to foster teacher candidate learning. Findings suggest that accessing short transcripts of teacher candidate performance supported teacher educators in planning a debriefing that was grounded in clear learning objectives and responsive to teacher candidates’ needs, while using the data from the portal to make practice public during the debriefing created opportunities for targeted feedback and supported meaning-making.",TRUE,FALSE,debriefing|digital simulation|practice based teacher education|Simulation|teacher education,2019-02-12T15:40:07.537814,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7f|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|Higher Education and Teaching,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/citation/,pwqb8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c619e11832ca60017b252a7/,5c619e11832ca60017b252a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pwqb8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pwqb8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pwqb8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In addition to overt forms of GBV, transgender individuals experience gender identity-related microaggressions: subtle, frequently-occurring aversive events that convey nonaffirmation or rejection of an individual’s gender identity. The degree to which a transgender individual is socially perceived as the gender with which they identify, sometimes referred to as passing, as well as sociodemographic factors such as annual income and race/ethnicity, have been previously linked with experiencing overt GBV. This study aimed to quantitatively assess whether self-rated degree of passing, age, annual income, and non-white race/ethnicity were associated with the frequency with which transgender individuals experience less overt identity-related victimisation in the form of gender nonaffirmation microaggressions. Among an age-diverse sample of U.S. adolescent and adult transgender persons (𝑛 = 224) who responded to 14 situational prompts of nonaffirmation microaggressions, adolescents experienced the highest average weekly frequency of nonaffirmation microaggressions (M = 2.16, SD = 1.48).

We identify five core areas ripe for potentially transformative investment, including (1) machine-readable standards, (2) data access platforms, (3) search and discoverability, (4) claim validation, and (5) insight generation. In each case, we review limitations associated with current practices, identify concrete opportunities for improvement via automation, and discuss near-term barriers to progress.

rqzj3,preprints,2019-04-26,2020-07-16,2019-04-26,NA,NA,Understanding the Marriage–Cohabitation Gap in Income Pooling: Evidence from 29 European Countries,"Pooling all incomes was long seen as the norm in male-breadwinner marriages, but in a time of dual-earner families, cohabitation, and divorce, the underpinnings of this model are eroding.  What consequences does this have for income pooling? 
We compare ca. 130,000 married and cohabiting couples from 29 European countries in the 2010 European Union Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) via random effects logit models. We show that cohabiting couples are generally more likely than married couples to keep at least some income separately, the so-called cohabitation gap.  Roughly a fifth of this gap we can attribute to compositional differences between married and cohabiting couples.  Further, the cohabiting group is heterogeneous and smaller when comparing only couples with children or only couples with a long relationship duration.  Lastly, we show that there is substantial variation in the size of the cohabitation gap across countries.  The size of this gap varies with the country-specific cohabitation rate, divorce rate, and female labor force participation rate.

The main objective of this study is to investigate the English teacher education programme (ETEP) in order to reform and develop current teaching practices in a rapidly developing area of research. The present study aims to look at three main areas which include the university preparation strategy, classroom teaching and supervisory support of an ETEP in Yemen. The data were collected through a questionnaire emailed to all the fourth-year student teachers of the English Department, Faculty of Education, at a public university in Yemen. The results reveal several issues concerning university courses, pedagogical practices, planning lessons, methodologies, and approaches. They disclose some inconsistencies between the proposed strategies at the university and the actual classroom implementation. The results also indicate that the present teaching duration is insufficient to realize the real benefits of the program for sustainable growth.

Estonia, a small Baltic state, has become a role model for the renewal of the social contract in times of big data (hence, often ironically referred to as ""E-stonia"").

The Estonian example suggests that online governance is most accepted in a small state, with a young population, trustworthy institutions and the need of technological renewal. This work examines the development of e-governance usage (citizens interacting digitally with the government) during the last decade in Europe from a comprehensive cross-country perspective: Size, age and trust are relevant for the usage of digital government services in Europe.

While recent work indicates that the TAP family comprises a Timor (T) branch and an Alor Pantar (AP) branch (Holton et al. 2012, Schapper et al. 2017) the internal structure of the AP branch has proven to be a challenging issue, and earlier studies leave large gaps in our understanding. Our Bayesian inference study is based on an extensive set of TAP lexical data from the online LexiRumah database (Kaiping &amp; Klamer, 2019). Systematically testing different approaches to cognate coding, loan exclusion, and explicit modelling choices, we arrive at a subgrouping structure of the TAP family that is based on features of the phylogenies shared across the different analyses.

However, the consequences of this large- scale institutional change for the educational inequality between children from different social class backgrounds in East Germany continue to be poorly understood. This article seeks to shed new light on this question by using a quasi-experimental approach to examine the difference in educational inequality between East and West Germany before and after German unification. We compare changes in the class gradient in educational attainment in East and West Germany across six birth cohorts, including three cohorts of individuals who completed their schooling after unification. Contrasting with past findings, our results show that before unification, educational inequality at the mid-secondary, upper-secondary and tertiary level was substantially lower in East Germany than in West Germany and that unification led to a substantial and sustained convergence of the level of educational inequality in East Germany towards that of West Germany.",TRUE,FALSE,Central and Eastern Europe|Difference-in-difference design|Educational inequality|Education policy|Equality of opportunity|German unification|Intergenerational social mobility|Market transition|Post-socialist transition|State socialism,2019-11-09T16:37:21.613396,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-09,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4f|Education|Vocational Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d55|Education|Early Childhood Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d56|Education|Adult and Continuing Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5c|Education|Higher Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d5f|Education|International and Comparative Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d64|Education|Social and Philosophical Foundations of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/citation/,bythr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc6a93d8f0e5e000bd02cb5/,5dc6a93d8f0e5e000bd02cb5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bythr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bythr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bythr,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcz012,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We test whether higher levels of educational attainment are associated with the decrease in housework participation as the previous research in countries of the global north suggests. Our findings reveal that education is not likely to reduce housework participation among Japanese women. Married Japanese women with children are unlikely to reduce their time spent on housework with the increase of their educational level and married Japanese women without children are more likely to increase their housework participation proportionately to the level of their education.

Nonetheless, by standard classification metrics the discipline seems to have made little progress. Although some remedy is promised by particular cross-validation strategies and machine learning tools, which increase accuracy rates substantively, predictions over time remain challenging. In this research note we provide evidence that the predictive performance of conflict models is plagued by temporal residual error. We demonstrate that standard classification metrics for binary outcome data are prone to underestimate model performance in a Binary-Time-Series-Cross-Section context when temporal prediction error is high. We approach this problem as a Modifiable Temporal Unit Problem and propose to evaluate the predictive performance of this type of model in differently sized temporal windows. While retaining the ability of models to leverage disaggregated data for prediction, we provide a parsimonious aggregation approach that allows researchers to evaluate the time frame in which predictive models perform best.

A set of questionnaire was distributed among 134 managers and executives from these GLCs to collect the primary data for this study. The perspectives of executives were collected based on ten factors of innovation practices utilizing the five-point Likert scales. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the data while the reliability and validity were tested using the Cronbach’s alpha test and the Skewness and Kurtosis test, respectively. Factor analysis was used to test the data consistency. The findings revealed the 82.8% of the respondents were agreeable to their firms’ emphasis on the factors of innovation. However, it was found that GLCs that were owned by the federal government placed more focus on innovation compared to the GLCs that were state-owned. This study reveals that overall the Malaysian GLCs should enhance their innovation practices by placing more focus on being engaged in the adoption of innovative designs at work, the reengineering of business processes, innovative pricing, market distribution and promotional methods, enhancing customer satisfaction by importing innovative warranty and maintenance systems, as well as by importing innovative claim clearing processes and methods, and the adoption of innovative order management and follow-up systems.",TRUE,FALSE,innovation; government-linked companies; sustainable competitive advantage; Malaysia,2019-06-14T09:59:07.358978,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/citation/,u7yth,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jbyxc/,jbyxc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d020fd6760f11001bfbc329/,5d020fd6760f11001bfbc329,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/u7yth/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/u7yth/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/u7yth,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

---

Dieses Dokument möchte einen möglichst breiten Konsens zur Findung einer internationalen Strategie zur Implementierung von Open Scholarship finden, die sowohl den Ansprüchen verschiedener nationaler und regionaler Communities gerecht werden kann, aber auch global funktioniert.

Forschung kann idealisiert als ein inspirierender Prozess gesehen werden, um unser kollektives Wissen zum Nutzen der gesamten Menschheit weiterzuentwickeln. Die aktuelle Forschungspraxis sieht sich jedoch im aktuellen Prozess der Adaption an die digitale Welt noch mit einer Reihe von Spannungen und Konflikten konfrontiert, die sicherlich teilweise auf Differenzen zwischen dem Ideal einer wissenschaftl. Commons-Community und dem Alltag des traditionell-hochkompetitiven Wissenschaftssystems liegen mag und teilweise auf die sowieso schon bestehenden Herausforderungen durch die Veränderung des Wissenschaftssystems inkl. Infrastruktur hin zu digitalen Lösungen. Das, was gemeinhin als Open Scholarship bezeichnet wird, ist hier als Ansatz gedacht, moderne Forschungs- und Lehr-/Lernpraktiken auf diese digitale Welt auszurichten. Wir schlagen hier keine normative Definition von Open Scholarship vor, sondern wollen anerkennen, dass es sich dabei um einen holistischen Begriff handelt, der das ganze Spektrum wissenschaftlicher Disziplinen und damit einhergehender, sich unterscheidender Prinzipien und Praktiken umfasst, die in anderen Kontexten u.a. auch als Open Science, Open Research oder Digital Humanities bezeichnet werden (mehr dazu in Punkt 3). Wir wählen den Begriff ""Open Scholarship"", um diese Aspekte in einem universellen und konstruktiven Sinne inklusiv einzubinden. (Wenn wir hier verkürzt mancherorts den Begriff der Forschung verwenden, ist dies stets den historischen Entwicklungen Rechnung tragend und als verkürzt für den gesamten Life Cycle von Wissenschaft, Forschung und Lehre.)

Zweck dieses Dokuments ist es, eine präzise Analyse des aktuellen Standes der weltweiten Open Scholarship-Bewegung bereitzustellen: dies wird eine Auseinandersetzung mit Fragen nach gemeinsamen Gedankenstränge, nach Stärken der Bewegung und nach Potential und beinhalten. Abschließend wird dargestellt, wie wir als global vernetzte Gemeinschaft effizienter zusammenarbeiten können, um die wichtigsten strategischen Prioritäten zu erkennen und gemeinsam voranzubringen. Dieses Dokument wurde von den Foundations for OER Strategy Development und der Arbeit der FORCE11 Scholarly Commons Working Group inspiriert und durch eine offene Arbeitsgruppe gemeinsam kollaborativ entwickelt.

Wir hoffen, dass dieses Dokument als eine Grundlage für weiteren Austausch, Diskussionen und sich daraus entwickelnden Initiativen zur Umsetzung wirksamer Strategien dienen kann, um die Integration von Open Scholarship-Praktiken in eine sich entwickelnde, moderne, digitale Forschungskultur gemeinsam voranzubringen. Dadurch erhoffen wir uns, die Reichweite und Wirkung von Open Scholarship in einem globalen Kontext ausweiten und verstärken zu können, um damit sicherzustellen, dass es wirklich offen für alle ist. Wir hoffen auch, dass sich dieses Dokument im Laufe der zahlreichen Diskussionen über Open Scholarship weiterentwickeln und dazu beitragen wird, nützliche Erkenntnisse sowohl für die globale Koordination der Sache, als auch für direktes Handeln vor Ort zu liefern. Wir glauben, dass dies ein wichtiger Schritt vorwärts ist, um Open Scholarship zur Norm werden lassen zu können.

Letztendlich erwarten wir, dass sich die Auswirkungen einer weit verbreiteten Übernahme von Open Scholarship vielfältig äußern werden. Wir erhoffen uns, dass neuartige Forschungspraktiken das Innovationstempo erhöhen und damit wichtige Industriezweige weltweit stimulieren können. Durch Open Scholarship wäre auch eine Zunahme des Vertrauens der Öffentlichkeit in die Wissenschaft möglich, da Transparenz im Wissenschaftsprozess damit normativer wird. Daher erwarten wir, dass das Interesse an Open Scholarship aufgrund seines inhärenten Einflusses sowohl auf die Zivilgesellschaft als auch die Weltwirtschaft in Zukunft deutlich zunehmen wird.",TRUE,FALSE,Offenes Publizieren|Open Access|Open Data|Open Education|Open Mindset|Opennes|Open Research|Open Scholarship|Open Science|Open Source|Scholarly Communication|Scholarly Publishing|Strategieentwicklung|Strategies|Strategy Development|Wissenschaftskommunikation,2019-02-17T17:45:42.331872,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hu9sj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hu9sj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hu9sj/citation/,hu9sj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hu9sj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hu9sj/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/fnq5u/,fnq5u,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hu9sj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c688c59f9de85001833ef5b/,5c688c59f9de85001833ef5b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hu9sj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hu9sj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hu9sj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hu9sj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hu9sj,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

First, the presence of women in formal politics has increased, albeit unevenly across parties and minority groups over time. Simultaneously, the capacity to study ‘political women’ has become supported through institutional mechanisms such as academic journals and communities of practice. Moreover, gender as a critical focus of analysis has been developed and refined. In the literature on women and politics, the shift from studying sex differences to interrogating gendered political institutions is especially salient. This institutional focus, along with recent intersectional studies of gender and politics, increases opportunities for cross-pollination of sociological and political science perspectives. In this review, I provide a brief history of the U.S. scholarship on gender and politics and map these relevant social, institutional, and theoretical advances. I highlight the value of recent intersectional contributions in this field and make the case for bringing partisanship – an increasingly salient political identity and structure – into intersectional approaches to gender and politics.",TRUE,FALSE,gender and politics|intersectionality|partisanship|political institutions|political representation,2019-05-09T16:03:27.505468,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-09,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/citation/,yag7f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd32ce0f244ec0021e27d41/,5cd32ce0f244ec0021e27d41,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yag7f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yag7f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yag7f,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Prior computational analyses attempting to analyze these elements have primarily relied on summarizing relatively low-level features. Beginning with the early work of Barry Salt, one particularly prominent metric is the distribution of median shot lengths. Works on shot length include Yuri Tsivian's Cinemetrics project, Arclight, and Jeremy Butler's ShotLogger.

This position ignores the moral and material value attributed to literacy in upland folklore, as well as the many radical messianic movements that purported to bring writing back to the highlands. I review nine such cases of recuperated literacy among Southeast Asian minorities, all of which were created in circumstances of violent conflict with lowland states. Leaders of these movements recognised literacy as an important vehicle of state power but their appropriation of writing was limited to very specific purposes and domains. In short, the new literacy practices did not mirror its ordinary bureaucratic uses in lowland states.

Relatively little is known about how demand-side market actors use online information and the implications for social stratification and mobility. This study provides an in-depth exploration of the online recruitment strategies pursued by human resource (HR) professionals. Qualitative interviews with 61 HR recruiters in two southern US metro areas reveal two distinct patterns in how they use Internet resources to fill jobs. For low and general skill work, they post advertisements to online job boards (e.g., Monster, CareerBuilder) with massive audiences of job seekers. By contrast, for high-skill or supervisory positions, they use LinkedIn to target passive candidates – employed individuals who are not looking for work but might be willing to change jobs. Although there are some intermediate practices, the overall picture is one of an increasingly bifurcated “winner-take-all” labor market in which recruiters focus their efforts on poaching specialized superstar talent (“purple squirrels”) from the ranks of the currently employed, while active job seekers are relegated to the hyper-competitive and impersonal “black hole” of the online job boards.",TRUE,FALSE,hiring|inequality|internet|job search|labor markets|recruitment|stratification,2019-08-22T15:38:23.100514,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Emerald,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/citation/,36p2x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nmbze/,nmbze,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5c86189aa3820019fb46af/,5d5c86189aa3820019fb46af,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/36p2x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/36p2x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/36p2x,https://doi.org/10.1108/S0277-283320190000033006,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To understand news rhythms, scholars have primarily studied how the rituals and routines of news organizations align with the practices and expectations of audiences.  The rhythms of today’s networked press, though, are set not only by journalists and consumers, but also by largely invisible digital infrastructures: software, data, and technologies from outside newsrooms that are increasingly intertwined with journalistic work.  Here, we argue that the rhythms of the contemporary, networked press live in the materials, practices, and values of hybrid, time-setting sociotechnical systems, a new concept we call anticipatory news infrastructure.  We explicate this concept through a typology of sociotechnical dynamics, showing how the networked press is poised to sense events, structure journalistic work, predict and commodify traffic, architect audience relations, and categorize content.  We argue that these infrastructures anticipate possible public life, thus creating anticipation publics through their largely invisible power to shape expectations of journalists and audiences alike.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-09-28T01:31:43.775640,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e13|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Critical and Cultural Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/citation/,2jtns,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8e483ed5512000195bf6de/,5d8e483ed5512000195bf6de,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2jtns/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2jtns/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2jtns,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study also examines how their cognition and pedagogical practices interplayed with the ecological contexts in the setting in which they taught. Integral to the study was the use of semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, stimulated-recall interviews, and course document review. Constructivist grounded theory informed the data analysis. Results revealed that the instructors’ cognition about second language (L2) writing, about teaching and learning L2 writing, and about their professional roles influences their teaching approach, curriculum design, and classroom assessment methods. The findings also stressed the role of the ecological contexts as a mediating force influencing the interaction between cognition and practices. The classroom context was identified as the most significant barrier to teaching writing; however, gaining access to L2 writing scholarship was viewed as the most significant facilitator for implementing effective practices in the L2 writing classroom. The findings showed that the instructors’ cognition about themselves as professionals could mitigate the impact of the ecological constraints hindering L2 writing instruction. This finding of the role of cognition may explain why teachers working in the same context under the same conditions teach differently. The implications of these findings include the importance of encouraging EFL writing instructors to reflect upon their cognition, pedagogical practices, and working contexts and the need for introducing recommended models of L2 writing instruction in tertiary institutions.",TRUE,FALSE,contextual factors|Grounded theory|L2 writing|teacher cognition,2019-10-11T16:48:05.803794,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/citation/,hx23j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da00b1ca7bc73000eea3440/,5da00b1ca7bc73000eea3440,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hx23j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hx23j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hx23j,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Progress has been limited by the availability of quantitative data to test competing theories, by divergent ideas regarding both predictor and outcomes variables, and by differences of opinion over methodology. To address all these problems, we utilize Seshat: Global History Databank, a large storehouse of information designed to test theories concerning the evolutionary drivers of social complexity in world history. In addition to the Big Gods hypothesis, which proposes that moralizing religion contributed to the success of increasingly large-scale complex societies, we consider the role of warfare, animal husbandry, and agricultural productivity in the rise of moralizing religions. Using a broad range of new measures of belief in moralizing supernatural punishment, we find strong support for previous research showing that such beliefs did not drive the rise of social complexity in world history. By contrast, our analyses indicate that intergroup warfare, supported by resource availability, played the most significant role in the evolution of both social complexity and moralizing religions. Thus, the correlation between social complexity and moralizing religion would seem to result from shared evolutionary drivers, rather than from strong direct causal relationships between these two variables. The data, methods, and results presented in this paper have been made publicly available online for others to inspect and critique, allowing additional analyses to be run and alternative assumptions to be tested, prior to peer review and publication.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|empirical test of theories|religion|social complexity|warfare,2019-11-20T12:26:23.381642,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-20,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://seshatdatabank.info/datasets/,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v59j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v59j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v59j/citation/,2v59j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v59j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v59j/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pa4qf/,pa4qf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v59j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd2ce9383135e000cbf46a8/,5dd2ce9383135e000cbf46a8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v59j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v59j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2v59j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2v59j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2v59j,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This raises questions of how stacking persists and how opportunities arise for athletes of different races to assume different roles. Demographic data on 41,484 NCAA football players reveal differences in opportunities and playing roles for student-athletes of different races. In concert with previous racial stacking studies, white players continue to be overrepresented in central, leadership positions. Racial minorities are overrepresented in peripheral ‘skill’ positions. Stacking at each playing position is affected differently by the demographics of player high schools and college teams. Players assuming non-stereotypical roles are much more likely to come from a racially homogenous high school or college team. Even though racially homogenous schools provide stereotype-defying opportunities, they also exhibit intense racial stacking. The few white (or black) players on such teams are overwhelmingly slotted into stereotypical positions. Since stereotype-defying opportunities tend to emerge in racially homogenous schools, blacks playing typically white positions come from relatively poor schools. In contrast, whites playing typically black positions are relatively affluent, since such opportunities tend to emerge in whiter, wealthier schools.

The article from a university instructor’s experience aims to bring forward the reasons the WC at Lebanese universities is slowly attracting students to its provided practices and how disciplinary instructors amongst other socio-cultural factors are contributing towards students misconceptions of the WC philosophy and services.  The article first introduces the profile of the Lebanese university English as a foreign language (EFL) student to provide a background on their English language level of proficiency and expectations from the WC tutors and the misguided understanding of the WC philosophies and framework practices that are opposing students’ expectations from the WC; and continues to construct the need for the WC to re-evaluate its current writing pedagogy and process between tutor and student.  The article concludes by discussing the negotiated roles WC tutors, disciplinary instructors and faculty management should take in order to transfer students’ misconception of the WC aims and objectives and to take responsibility for their writing.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-10-11T16:41:41.204640,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/citation/,wyc58,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da00657f6b03e00101cfa49/,5da00657f6b03e00101cfa49,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wyc58/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wyc58/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wyc58,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Classification Approaches for German User Comments.,"Impoliteness and incivility in online discussions have recently been discussed as relevant issues in communication science. However, automatically detecting these concepts with computational methods is challenging. In our study, we build and compare supervised classification models to predict impoliteness and incivility in online discussions on German media outlets on Facebook. Using a sample of 10,000 hand-coded user comments and a theory-grounded coding scheme, we develop classifiers on different feature sets including unigram and n-gram distributions as well as various dictionary-based features. Our findings show that impoliteness and incivility can be measured to a certain extent on the word level of a comment, but the models suffer from high misclassification rates, even if lexical resources are included. This is mainly because the classifiers cannot reveal subtle forms of incivility and because comment authors often use predictive words of incivility or impoliteness in non-offensive ways or in different contexts. Still, when applying the classifiers to a comparable set of comments, we find that the machine-coded categories and the hand-coded categories reveal similar patterns regarding the distribution of and the user reactions to uncivil/impolite comments. The findings of our study therefore provide new insights into the supervised machine learning approach to the detection of different forms of offensive language.",TRUE,FALSE,automated content analysis|document classification|impoliteness|incivility|machine learning|online discussions|user comments,2019-12-04T11:33:06.011387,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e18|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Speech and Rhetorical Studies,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/citation/,a47ch,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de6e3d4ab905e000beeda29/,5de6e3d4ab905e000beeda29,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a47ch/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a47ch/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a47ch,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is a dearth of systematic information about the Black movement and Black protests between 1995 and its reemergence in Black Lives Matter in 2012. Using a new automated system, we identified 1017 events in 1049 news wire stories relevant to Black protest between 1994 and 2010 from the Annotated English Gigaword file. These data provide insight into Black activism in the between 1994 and 2010 and identify themes that are salient for both the resurgence of the Black Lives Movement after 2012 and the rise of White supremacist movements. Over a third of all protest events are about policing, generally about police violence. Other major themes include direct struggles over White vs. Black symbolic representations and access to resources, including protests over Confederate symbols, abolition of affirmative action programs, and White supremacists. The 1995 Million Man March shows up as having a significant connection to subsequent mobilization, a relationship that is confirmed by historical accounts. A third of the protests are around a wide variety of other specific issues that will require more detailed classification. Time trends show active and rising Black mobilization in the 1990s through 2001 that was interrupted by the 9/11 terror attacks and not significantly resumed until 2006-7. Overall, most protests in this era appear to have been reacting against attacks on existing benefits rather than proactively seeking new benefits. Methodologically, we show the importance of maintaining information about both events and coverage of events and of identifying the relations between events using the concepts of campaign, master event, and subevent.

Objectives: The article describes the results of author’s own research into selected aspects of sexual health of women with intellectual disability (ID). The focus has been on issues such as menstruation, health and gynecological care, pharmacologization, contraception, STDs, and menopause.

Methods: The research was conducted with 11 women using structured interviews.

Results: Results suggest that these women have a low level of competencies to manage and control health problems in an optimal way. Their behavior is determined by people from their living environment to a large extent. Women with ID report various abnormalities in the course of developmental phenomena and in their own health, indicating potentially serious diseases and disorders.

Respondent perception of good governance practices was measured using a seven-point Likert scale and analyzed by descriptive statistics and path measurement modeling. Standard diagnostic tests were also conducted to check the reliability of the data and model. Results indicated that nine factors were significant in the measurement of good governance practices. However, very few people in the public sector of Malaysia practice fraud control, which is at the lowest intensity.

This renewed interest has been informed by new approaches that emphasize sensitive and critical periods during the first years of life, offer an understanding of human development as a hierarchical and cross-fertilizing process, suggest plausible mechanisms for the persistent effect of early exposures, and explore heterogeneity in effects based on environmental and biological factors. The articles included in this special issue of Population Research and Policy Review advance the field of early-life circumstances in several important dimensions. They examine the determinants and effects of noxious exposures at different developmental stages—ranging from the prenatal period to adolescence—in a variety of national settings. They offer an understanding of early-life circumstances that moves from discrete outcomes to a dynamic life-course approach, and consider diverse sources of heterogeneity in the effects of early exposures.",TRUE,FALSE,Child development|Early childhood|Early life|Environmental exposures|Health|Life course|Prenatal exposures|Stratification,2019-12-04T04:23:45.645214,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/citation/,b4hmv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de691f5ab905e000bee6225/,5de691f5ab905e000bee6225,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b4hmv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b4hmv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b4hmv,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-019-09555-w,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
3jteh,preprints,2019-09-20,2019-09-23,2019-09-20,NA,NA,Understanding Coordinated and Inauthentic Link Sharing Behavior on Facebook in the Run-up to 2018 General Election and 2019 European Election in Italy,"The year 2016 marked a turning point in the history of relations between the Internet, social media, public opinion, and politics. Online practices of grassroots participation, which used to be considered the prerogative of democratizing forces fighting established powers, turned out to be an effective platform for far-right extremists. In the attempt to make sense of what happened and develop workable solutions, stakeholders rapidly moved through the different stages of grief, ranging from denial to anger and acceptance.

As a case in point, we trace the path through these stages which moved from an initial denial of the problem to concern over “fake news” and hoaxes, to finally focusing on the behavior of certain actors on the platform. Starting from the current phase, we analyze “coordinated inauthentic behavior”, a concept only briefly defined in Facebook public statements which, nevertheless, is useful to frame future studies insofar as both the idea of coordination and authenticity have been studied in the literature. Leveraging these works, we suggest a definition that is at once framed in this literature and easy to operationalize.

Using this definition and an unprecedented combination of CrowdTangle API (a tool for accessing Facebook and other social media data) and two datasets of Italian political news stories published in the run-up to the 2018 Italian general election and 2019 European election, we developed a method that led to the identification of several networks of pages/groups/verified public profiles (“entities”) that shared the same political news stories on Facebook within a very short period of time (10 in 2018, composed of 28 entities, and 50 in 2019, composed of 143 entities). We call this behavior “coordinated link sharing”. By analyzing the social media profiles of such coordinated entities, we observed that while some of them were clearly political, others presented themselves as entertainment venues, despite sharing political content too. Since the political news stories shared by these non-political entities can reach a broad audience which is largely unguarded against attempts to influence, we describe their behavior as “inauthentic”.

Further analyses showed that the news shared by the coordinated networks received a Facebook engagement higher than other news included in our dataset, that much news boosted anti-immigration and far-right propaganda and that several of the news outlets shared by these networks were already blacklisted by fact-checkers.",TRUE,FALSE,coordinated inauthentic behaviour|crowdtangle|election|facebook|italy|link sharing|social media,2019-09-20T20:42:43.439056,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e11|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Journalism Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Social Influence and Political Communication,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/citation/,3jteh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wy7rd/,wy7rd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d84d8ac305a6800190b5b65/,5d84d8ac305a6800190b5b65,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3jteh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3jteh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3jteh,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
purmh,preprints,2019-01-28,2020-07-16,2019-01-28,NA,NA,Thinking in time within urban health,"Time as a dimension is beguiling. Philosophy has puzzled over it, physics queried its nature, and popular culture entertained us with its peculiarities. As a construct, time is multifaceted. While we experience time, we are subject to it. We also harness time, and apply it as an instrument and a lens. However, time also represents a means to enrich knowledge of urban health. To achieve this aim will involve accounting for time as well as thinking in time.
Thinking in time within urban health draws attention to the evolution of urban contexts, such as neighbourhoods, the life-courses of these settings and, the dynamics between the life-course of people and their health in place, with the life-course of place. Thinking in time also entails attending to the nature of time itself, and the manner by which re-imagining time may transform how urban health is queried.
Cross-disciplinary in nature, and trans-disciplinary in its intent, this conceptual review reflects on observational research to consider what has been discovered about neighbourhood effects, and how time features in this information. Furthermore, this review outlines theories and methods for thinking in time to advance understandings of how, why and for whom neighbourhoods matter to health.",TRUE,FALSE,Lifecourse|Neighborhoods|Time|Transdisciplinary|Urban health,2019-01-28T23:02:05.472044,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/purmh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/purmh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/purmh/citation/,purmh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/purmh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/purmh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/purmh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4ec8ff568329001d7f7b86/,5c4ec8ff568329001d7f7b86,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/purmh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/purmh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/purmh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/purmh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/purmh,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The relevant literature links emigration to states’ developmental needs, which does not explain why some states choose to economically subsidize their citizens’ emigration. This article explores for the first time the soft power importance of high-skilled emigration from authoritarian emigration states. It finds that the Egyptian state under Gamal Abdel Nasser employed labor emigration for two distinct purposes linked to broader soft power interests: first, as an instrument of cultural diplomacy to spread revolutionary ideals of Arab unity and anti-imperialism across the Middle East; second, as a tool for disseminating development aid, particularly in Yemen and sub-Saharan Africa.

On many occasions, one community becomes dominant owing to several societal factors, and other communities remain on the edge. Religion in Bangladesh has a complex history. Besides, digital media as a new phenomenon has met religion recently, although this issue is often overlooked. As a result, no formal academic endeavor is seen in Bangladesh to date which focuses on the emerging digital Islamic public sphere and online religious communication. The present study tries to bridge this gap. Through careful observation of the digital public, their used contents, and produced cases of contestation, this article finds some exclusive communication patterns. First, communication among religious communities is unequal where Muslims dominate the discourse. Second, Islamic contents are more frequent in cyberspace than the contents of other religions.

srcg2,preprints,2019-11-18,2019-11-18,2019-11-18,NA,NA,"Electoral Systems, Competition, and Incentives for Corruption","What is the effect of electoral rules on political corruption? While the influence of electoral systems on accountability and representation has been widely studied, the link between electoral systems and corruption remains sparse. This paper develops a model for the interplay between corruption and electoral rules, considering the incentives for challengers to expose the corruption undertaken by the incumbents. I identify two major components: first, rules that increase competition create incentives for freeriding, as challengers would prefer that other challengers pay the cost of exposure. Second, larger district sizes create coordination problems, as the same incumbent may be overexposed, while others were not exposed at all.

And in my point of view, tomb of King Qa’a resembles a particular burial system – “Huangchangticou”(黄肠题凑). Since human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroups O be found in Egypt, but no in the others in the image in the paper, I speculate that there must be a “indigenous people” in the Liangzhu area to return to Egypt with the fleet. From the paper , I speculate that the eagle in a statue of a man, dating from Yue State (越国) and the eagles in Fanshan Cemetery and Yaoshan Hill, the Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City (良渚古城遗址反山墓地和瑶山), resemble the God Horus in Egypt. I can also get a conclusion that Zhejiang(浙江)(including Yuhang(余杭)and Shaoxing(绍兴)) was once Egypt’s colony. From the paper, I can get a conclusion that Mojiaoshan Terrace (莫角山台地) resembles the Ziggurat of Ur and Anu Ziggurat, Uruk (modern Warka) in function and shape. In my point of view, Narmer's tomb in Umm el-Qa'ab near Abydos in Upper Egypt is a cenotaph of his. And from the paper, I can conclude that the “grass-wrapped silt” discovered by Liangzhu archaeologists in Archaeological Ruins of Liangzhu City has the same shape, size and use of building materials as the mud bricks used in the construction of cities, palaces and tombs during Narmer’s period of ancient Egypt, so I can conclude that the territory of Liangzhu culture (including Yuhang(余杭)and Shaoxing(绍兴)) was once Egypt’s colony. From the paper, I can find the prototype of the square-shape (the shape of ""Hui""(回), a Chinese character) altars on Mt. Yaoshan and Mt. Huiguanshan from Dendera zodiac. From the paper, I can conclude that the divine emblem unearthed from Tomb M12, Fanshan cemetery indicates that the owner of the tomb was probably the governor of ancient Egypt. Since Fanshan (反山) is an artificially piled up mastaba shape like mound and it is larger than any other tombs of mastabas of the kings in ancient Egypt, I can get a hypothesis that Yu (Narmer) died while on a hunting tour to the eastern frontier of his empire, and chose Fanshan (反山) as his tomb at first , but for some unknown reasons, he buried in Yu mausoleum (大禹陵) ,  Mount Kuaiji (会稽山) , south of present-day Shaoxing (绍兴).",TRUE,FALSE,Anu Ziggurat|Dendera zodiac|divine emblem|Fanshan (反山)|governor of ancient Egypt|grass-wrapped silt|Horus|Huangchangticou(黄肠题凑)|mastaba|Mojiaoshan Terrace|mud bricks|Narmer|square-shape altars|Uruk|Yu mausoleum (大禹陵)|Yu (禹)|Ziggurat of Ur,2019-08-28T20:54:25.351548,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ce5|Arts and Humanities|History|Other History,"Bohai,Xu",2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/citation/,gbhvf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d650c392a8cc000163d47c8/,5d650c392a8cc000163d47c8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gbhvf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gbhvf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gbhvf,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

8rf2h,preprints,2019-05-03,2020-07-16,2019-05-03,NA,NA,Coding Together - Coding Alone: The Role of Trust in Collaborative Programming,"In the digital economy, innovation processes increasingly rely on highly specialised know-how and open-source software shared on digital platforms on collaborative programming. The information that feeds into the content on these platforms is provided voluntarily by a vast crowd of knowledgeable users from all over the world. In contributing to the platforms, users invest their time and share knowledge with strangers to add to the rising body of digital knowledge.This requires an open mindset and trust. In this study, we argue that such a mindset is not just an individual asset, but determined by the local communities the users are embedded in. We, therefore, hypothesise that places with higher levels of trust should contribute more to StackOverflow, the world’s largest question-and-answer platform for programming questions. In relating the city-level contributions of 266 OECD metropolitan areas to infrastructure, economic, and trust measures, we find this hypothesis confirmed. In contrast, click rates to the platform are  solely  driven  by  infrastructure  and  economic  variables,  but  not  by  trust.  These  findings highlight the importance of societal values in the 21st century knowledge economy: if policy-makers want to develop a lively local digital economy, it is not enough to provide fast Internet access and business opportunities.

This study examines how gender inequalities in evaluations depend on the design of the tools used to judge merit. Exploiting a quasi-natural experiment at a large North American university, we found that the number of scale points used in faculty teaching evaluations—whether instructors were rated on a scale of 6 versus a scale of 10—significantly affected the size of the gender gap in evaluations. A survey experiment, which presented all participants with an identical lecture transcript but randomly varied instructor gender and the number of scale points, replicated this finding and suggested that the number of scale points affects the extent to which gender stereotypes of brilliance are expressed in quantitative ratings.

This approach's potential is shown by analysing the collective patterns of the most notable sociologists on Wikipedia –i.e., those who have their biographies in ten or more languages. We perform a formal analysis of this 'social memory' source, building cultural cartographies that visualise frequencies of recognised sociologists, trends in gender composition, diffusion and centrality of the main referents, geographical centres of the discipline, clusters of biographical connections, reference flows between countries and birth-death mobility. Linking these patterns in a diachronic way, we distinguish five generations of sociologists and emphasise the high historical concentration of the discipline in geographical areas, gender, and schools of thought.

Recent research points to the incentive structures faced by differentially positioned members of a parliamentary party: unlike backbenchers, MPs who hold a ministerial portfolio can use the prerequisites of executive office to shield themselves from the costs of governance. This article tests the theory of executive particularism by examining the electoral fortunes of government ministers in India. Sitting government ministers are found to outperform other candidates, however, tests of causality fail to demonstrate that holding a ministerial portfolio causes this electoral benefit. Instead, it appears that a candidate’s electoral performance enhances the likelihood of being granted a ministerial portfolio in the first place.

In particular, we will explore a series of substantial challenges that are likely to come to the fore during the 2020s. These include:
* making a persuasive case for retaining traditional models of ‘school’ and ‘teacher’ in the face of compelling alternatives
* develop broader notions of ‘skills’, ‘competencies’ and ‘aptitudes’ that help students to flourish in an age of precarious employment, misinformation and an increasingly fragmented society
* engaging with digital technology in ways that strengthen the character and values of public education
* renegotiating relationships between educational institutions and the corporate actors that are shaping education agendas around the world
* engaging with public opinion, and fostering a genuine public understanding of (and support for) education
* re-imagining educational provision and practices that are appropriate for an age of climate change.
While these are all incredibly complex challenges, there is good reason to remain hopeful.

In this study, we argue that communication practices are an important but overlooked factor in the formation of useful advice relationships between entrepreneurs, particularly in the context of developing economies. We hypothesize that improving entrepreneurs’ communication practices will affect the relationships they form and have implications for their business performance. To test our theory, we conducted a field experiment in Togo with 301 entrepreneurs who were randomized into a communication practices intervention that was embedded in a business training program. We found that entrepreneurs who were exposed to better communication practices perceived interactions more cooperatively and exchanged more information during those interactions. Moreover, improving communication practices also led to a 50 percent increase in the number of relationships entrepreneurs formed with peers. These relationships exhibited more matching based on skill and were more ethnically diverse. Finally, communication practices training also substantially increased entrepreneurs’ business performance.

Recent studies have advanced the political backlash model by emphasizing the process at lower levels, measuring broad political disagreement within congregations and subsequent disaffiliation among religionists. I argue that while studying political disagreement at the congregational level is a step in the right direction, the role of conflict on specific, salient issues has been underemphasized. Using data from the Baylor Religion Survey, I exploit a unique set of items to analyze what I call “conflicted religionists”—religionists who experience attitudinal conflict with their churches—and I measure conflict on two salient issues: same-sex marriage and abortion. I find that there is a considerable proportion of conflicted religionists on both issues and that the probability of experiencing conflict varies drastically across different groups in the sample. I further demonstrate that experiencing conflict is significantly associated with lower church attendance.

Melalui pelacakan data kualitatif dan wawancara, ditunjukkan bahwa sebagai masyarakat sipil komunitas ini tidak memposisikan diri sebagai lawan maupun partner bagi pemerintah. Lebih jauh bahwa sesungguhnya keduanya lebih mementingkan terwujudnya gagasan yang mereka usung, keterbukaan dan profesionalisme publikasi. Baik gagasan itu merupakan usulan mereka, maupun gagasan yang muncul dari pihak pemerintah. Pemerintah dalam hal ini tidak saja kemenristekdikti, melainkan lembaga-lembaga riset di bawah kementrian dan komisi lain yang merepresentasi pemerintah seperti Komisi Informasi Pusat. Pelacakan irisan gagasan sebagai penggerak organisasi ditengarai merupakan bentuk kepemimpinan masyarakat sipil baru. Bergerak dari personifikasi aktor-aktor menjadi perdebatan gagasan.

The article maps out the terrain of diversity discourses, both as a specific type of discourse and as an example of ethical, moral and pragmatic modes of argumentation. The author examines Swedish ""diversity discourses"" in the periods of 1968-1975 and 1991-1995 in an effort to tease out the pragmatic, moral and ethical aspects of these discourses. Diversity discourses are defined as discourses regarding how much and what kind of diversity is acceptable or desirable in a society, as well as how such diversity should be handled. I find that values, both contextually-dependent ethical values and universal moral values, rather than being ""prior"" to politics, arise out of the intersection of pragmatic, ethical and moral discourses. What is moral and ethical, then is colored by the particular nexus of moral, ethical and pragmatic concerns such that what is acceptable at one particular time and location, may be unacceptable in another, even coming from the same actors with the same ideological commitments. Shifts in the ethical/moral modes of justification, then, lead to shifts in who is included in a democratic community.",TRUE,FALSE,Civil Repair|Habermas|Immigration|Morality|Politics|Sweden|Values,2019-04-17T13:43:10.440844,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Carly Schall,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/citation/,qnwaz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb7176da3bc970017f1567d/,5cb7176da3bc970017f1567d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qnwaz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qnwaz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qnwaz,https://doi.org/10.1057/s41290-020-00105-y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We argue that both problems and solutions can be diverging (contested, complex, uncertain) or converging (uncontested, well-defined, informed). Based on the resulting problem-solution topology, we suggest a process-oriented view on MIP and discuss three alternative pathways along which convergence between problems and solutions can be achieved to transform wicked problems into legitimate solutions.

Previous research shows the generic structure of acknowledgements written by native Persian postgraduate students contains a ‘thanking-God move’, absent in native English speakers’ acknowledgements. In an approximate replication of Hyland’s (2004) study of the generic structure of acknowledgments, we aimed to verify the occurrence, frequency, and variation of moves and steps in three small corpora of acknowledgments from six disciplines (applied linguistics, business management, computer science, electrical engineering, microbial biotechnology, &amp; biochemistry). Each corpus contained 200 sample acknowledgements written in Persian or English. The authors were native Persian speakers and native English speakers. Fifty acknowledgements (100-400 words) were randomly selected from each corpus and analyzed using Hyland’s model. Two coders carefully, content-analyzed, and coded the acknowledgments. Then the data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The results confirmed findings of previous research indicating that acknowledgements written by native Persian speakers (in Persian &amp; in English) contain all the moves and steps defined by Hyland plus a new step called ‘thanking-God’ step. The use of this step was significantly different across Persian and English (84% in English &amp; 100% in Persian; X2= 1.63, p≤ 0.05) and across writers (84% Persian &amp; 34% English; X2= 28.17, p≤.05). ‘Accepting responsibility’ and ‘dedicating the thesis’ were used least frequently by all writers, while ‘thanking move’ and ‘reflecting move’ were used most frequently.

If the child has been diagnosed with autism, parents already face special behavioural challenges. What makes ASD even more difficult, are the many other medical health issues that often arise in this population.
The purpose of this article is to summarise the latest understanding of autism’s commonly associated physical and mental health conditions.
Methods: An analysis of relevant literature, sources from the internet and published literature, personal experience and observations of the author.
Recent findings: Autism is a disorder of the whole body. It is often in co-morbidity with: epilepsy, gastrointestinal disorders, neuro-inflammation and immunological disorders, asthma, eczema, sleep disturbances, eating and feeding disorders, food allergies, attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), headaches, anxiety disorders, bipolar disorder, depression, schizophrenia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Fragile X syndrome, intellectual disability, nonverbal learning disorder, motor clumsiness, Tourette syndrome, sensory problems, tuberous sclerosis, oxidative stress, acquired mitochondrial dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities. Many of the issues outlined here can overlap each other.
Conclusions:Improved understanding of the underlying pathology of ASD and associated conditions, and the development of a common purpose across multiple treating sites, can improve the consistent and coordinated healthcare of children with autism.

This paper seeks to measure the changes in legitimation efforts around the time of elections in authoritarian regimes. It is well understood that authoritarian regimes can benefit from the process and image of elections, as long as they remain managed. But it is less clear how these governments justify the management of such elections, and whether they are accepted by the population. Relying on detailed events data measuring the frequency of certain legitimating government statements, this paper tests whether electoral authoritarian regimes increase their justifications for remaining in power or devote their efforts to undermining the legitimacy of opposition parties in order to reduce the uncertainty of electoral loss.",TRUE,FALSE,Authoritarian Regimes|Elections|Human Rights|Legitimation|Propaganda|State Repression,2019-04-09T22:06:33.075967,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-09,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnb7t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnb7t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnb7t/citation/,xnb7t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnb7t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnb7t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5sjem/,5sjem,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnb7t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cad0f14404d5f0019efd9db/,5cad0f14404d5f0019efd9db,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnb7t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnb7t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xnb7t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xnb7t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xnb7t,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In the world of fusion power development, in November 2018, a U.S. National Academies’ report on US fusion research recommended a national ‘burning plasma’ fusion power facility but also emphasized the private sector’s role in fusion innovation. In the same month, the Fusion Industry Association publicly announced its launch, indicating a level of private-sector industry maturity. Multiple FIA members boldly aim to accelerate fusion’s commercial deployment to approximately one decade, yet none are fully funded to overcome the ‘valley of death’ innovation-to-commercialization obstacle. Nonetheless, introducing fusion power (a ‘Future Fusion Economy’) in a 2030-2040 timeframe could contribute substantially towards transitioning from fossil fuels within this century and thereby contribute significantly to addressing climate change in the post-Paris Agreement period. This article applies the Quadruple and Quintuple Innovation Helix Ecosystem framework to this problem. We consider how Global South funding for entrepreneurship and innovation, via petrostates’ sovereign wealth funds, can accelerate the development and commercialization of fusion, through funding continuous innovation operations. We advocate a multi-sectoral and multilateral approach to accelerate fusion innovation, increase global quality of democracy, and protect the natural environment, via a managed co-opetive global solution like the IEA’s commission.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|fusion|Global South|private sector|Quintuple Innovation Helix|super wicked problem,2019-09-04T19:52:22.025361,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|International Economics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/citation/,axb95,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n3jvx/,n3jvx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ea8b380f9b5001666af89/,5d6ea8b380f9b5001666af89,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/axb95/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/axb95/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/axb95,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To achieve the aim of the study, 40 ESP College students were randomly chosen from the college of political sciences at A-Nahrain University in Iraq, the participants were in the second grade during the academic year 2017-2018. Two groups were enrolled in this experiment, 20 ESP students in the experimental group and the same number in the control group. To determine if the intensive reading strategy had an impact on ESP student's in developing vocabulary, a pre-posttest was administered for both groups. The control group was treated by the traditional way of teaching vocabulary through translating the words in Arabic language and memorizing them with the help of the teacher, while the experimental group was treated by using intensive reading strategy for about ten weeks. The chosen texts were taken from (New Head way Pre-intermediate student's book). Fill in the blank exercises had been chosen in the pre-posttest which consist of 50 items for each, the test was administered by the researcher. Based on the findings of this research, it was found that the new strategy has a positive impact on ESP College students' in mastering vocabulary that was proven from the improvement of students’ mean score from pretest to posttest.

Representative surveys consistently find dramatically decreasing levels of sexual prejudice among all groups, among men and young men in particular. Qualitative scholarship, however, continues to find that enactments of homophobia remain integral components of contemporary masculine identities. In this article, we make sense of this shift and apparent methodological inconsistency. We do not question which measure is best.

In “The Elementary Forms of Religious Life,” Durkheim studied Aboriginal Australian religion in an effort to better understand humanity as a whole. In doing so, he introduced a variety of concepts and terms that to many of today’s readers could be considered rather confusing. This project works to make tangible and relatable the implications behind the esoteric Aboriginal Australian terminology used by Durkheim. It does so by relating vocabulary and themes contained within the text to the galaxy far, far away of Star Wars. Several key examples of this application and relation to Star Wars include relating Durkheim’s totemic force to The Force in Star Wars, connecting the concept of a churinga to the lightsaber, and examining Durkheim’s division between religion and magic by looking at the Jedi and Sith.

This institutionalized sexism not only inhibits women’s ability to protest safely and effectively, but also permeates the activist imagination and aggravates interpersonal violence. Even Nonhuman Animals as a feminized group are unwittingly disparaged in popular campaigns. This essay suggests that structural sexism in the Nonhuman Animal rights movement is nourished by its patriarchal organization, specifically its decision to professionalize. Twenty-first century vegan feminist activism on the margins has been able to circumvent the hegemony of professionalized power and challenge taken-for-granted bureaucratic structures. Yet, despite indications that vegan feminist activists are influencing the movement dialogue, the movement’s patriarchal norms have encouraged considerable pushback. Indeed, the patriarchal influence of professionalization has even created division between second wave and third wave vegan feminists.",TRUE,FALSE,Animal Rights|Critical Animal Studies|Digital Culture|Digital Protest|Ecofeminism|Factionalism|Feminism|Intersectionality|Nonprofit Industrial Complex|Nonprofits|Professionalization|Social Movements|Solidarity|Veganism,2019-05-03T14:23:07.327391,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-03,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e45|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Animals and Society,Corey Wrenn,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/citation/,jtps8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccaf2cdd7dc3f00176d10d0/,5ccaf2cdd7dc3f00176d10d0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jtps8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jtps8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jtps8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Through interviews with 23 religious sisters, I analyze the subtle strategies of action they employ to minister to marginalized populations who may feel alienated by the institutional Catholic Church. Despite their own structural position in the Catholic Church and secular society, American Catholic nuns like the Sisters of St. Joseph emerge as powerful women who exercise agency to respond to the human and social needs of lay Catholics and non-Catholics, even when this work is counter to official Church teaching. Overall, I argue that the Sisters of St. Joseph are guiding progressive voices in the Catholic Church—particularly around human sexuality and relationships—and have the potential to shape the direction of the Church in the twenty-first century.",TRUE,FALSE,Agency|Catholic Church|Gender|Nuns|Qualitative|Religion|Sexuality|Sociology|Women Religious,2019-07-19T17:10:02.002577,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcx4b/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcx4b/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcx4b/citation/,fcx4b,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcx4b/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcx4b/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcx4b/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d30b2e7251f0e0016071c43/,5d30b2e7251f0e0016071c43,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcx4b/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcx4b/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fcx4b/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fcx4b/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fcx4b,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Bewertungen in akademischen Nachrufen,"Evaluations have a long history in academia. They do not only ascribe worth to individual achievements like article manuscripts and project proposals, but also to the academic personnel. Evaluations of academic persons are particularly apparent in academic obituaries, a genre that evaluates lifetime achievements of deceased academics. Drawing on a qualitative analysis of 216 obituaries that have been published in academic journals, this contribution reconstructs basic characteristics of evaluations of academic persons. The article highlights, first, typical practices of the evaluation of academic persons, second, temporal, national and disciplinary variations of selected evaluation criteria, and, third, it distinguishes modes of evaluation in which academics evaluate either themselves or others. Against this backdrop, the contribution develops an exploratory comparison with other academic and non-academic genres of the evaluation of persons: religious confessions, therapy, and biographies on scientists.

In our approach, which we call Concept Mover's Distance, a document is measured by the minimum distance the words in the document need to travel to arrive at the position of a ""pseudo document"" consisting of only words denoting a focal concept.  This approach captures the prototypical structure of concepts,  is fairly robust to pruning sparse terms as well as variation in text lengths within a corpus, and when used with pre-trained embeddings, can be used even when terms denoting concepts are absent from corpora and can be applied to bag-of-words datasets.

Ego network data provide personal network information, as the data are based on a sample of individuals. This chapter details the basic features of such data, describing the advantages, disadvantages and potential applications of using ego network data. Ego network data remain a popular choice, despite the growing availability of full networks from automated sources (such as cell phone records). This is in large part because ego network data are easy to collect but still provide a surprisingly large amount of network information. Ego network data are also quite flexible, with past work using the same basic data structure for widely different purposes: from measuring social support and social boundaries; to inferring global network features from a sample; to acting as a corrective for other sampling techniques (such as respondent-driven sampling). Ego network data are thus easy to collect and useful for a wide variety of substantive and methodological problems. Given the ease of collection and the flexibility of use, there is every reason to believe that ego network data will continue to be a useful option for network scholars.

89fvt,preprints,2019-11-26,2019-11-27,2019-11-27,NA,NA,Is orgasmic meditation a form of sex?,"Orgasmic Meditation(OM) is a structured, partnered meditative practice in which one person, who can be any gender, strokes the clitoris of their partner for 15 minutes. As such, it resembles a sexual activity. OM is taught as a practice that is distinct from sex, and we wondered whether people who engage in OM actually maintain that distinction themselves. We conducted an online convenience sample survey including qualitative open-ended text questions and quantitative Likert-style questions that was distributed to email listservs for practitioners of OM. The 30-item questionnaire included questions designed to differentiate the potentially related concepts of OM, seated meditation, fondling, and sex, as bases for comparison. The quantitative results of this mixed method study show that OM practitioners view the practice as significantly more similar to meditation than to sex or fondling. These results were consistent, regardless of whether the question was asked in the positive or negative and whether OM was being compared to one behavior individually or to multiple behaviors at the same time. The distinction between OM and sex/fondling rapidly becomes more pronounced as practitioners complete more OMs. This suggests that the novelty of genital touching in meditation may diminish over time, as practitioners get used to the more alternative point of focus.

The development of the pragmatic, integrated method of Communicative Circle builds upon the linguo-didactic, integrated, and activity approaches, and the theory of three levels of awareness of learning. These perspectives are reflected in the integration of listening, reading and speaking skills, three stages of teaching, regarding the psychological phases of awareness of the studied material, and the choice of tasks according to the students’ abilities, basic skills and the tempo of learning. In the course of study students are gradually offered more complicated tasks for training speaking and texts for reading and listening, and the whole teaching process builds upon broadening some professional and scientific knowledge of students at a technical university. The efficiency of the developed Communicative Circle method is verified in the course of a two-year experiment. The results of teaching by the traditional program (developed on the basis of the Federal State Standards) and by the method of the Communicative Circle are compared and evaluated. The article concludes a greater efficiency of the developed method which reveals itself in higher English proficiency, confidence, and wider professional purview of the students who were taught by the Communicative Circle method.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-07-21T21:17:42.284409,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/citation/,aktrg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bd01545253a001c41af8e/,5d2bd01545253a001c41af8e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/aktrg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/aktrg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/aktrg,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In view of this, a time series approach is considered to examine the empirical evidence of Fisher’s effect in the country. By applying OLS and Unit Root test, the estimated value is used to determine the casual relationship between interest rates and inflation for the monthly sample period of August 1996 to December 2003. The empirical results suggest that there does not exist any co-movement of inflation with interest rates and the relationship between the variables is also not significant for Bangladesh.

Smugglers have developed their kind of artifacts, the narcosubs. The Colombian Navy has adopted several strategies and adapted several technologies in their attempt to control the flows of illicit drugs. In the so-called War on Drugs (WoD), law enforcement, military, and drug smugglers have engaged in the production, modification, and maintenance of technological artifacts. Based on documentary material, observations and interviews I present the process of innovation by antagonism in the War on Drugs in Colombia. I present an overview of the co-evolution of drug trafficking technologies and the techniques and technologies used by the Colombian Navy to counter the activities of drug smugglers. I emphasize on the process of self-building artifacts by smugglers, explained as a bricolage of local knowledge of traditional boat building with off-the-shelf technologies and in the localized character of the responses by the Navy personnel.

The choice for corresponding author was a second best approach, as the preferred choice for this analysis would have been submitting author.

Starting in the 1950s, various traditions in economics purported to explain the concept of “inflation inertia”. Contributions ranging from Celso Furtado and M.H. Simonsen to James Tobin anticipated key aspects of what later became the inertial inflation hypothesis, building it into either mathematical or conceptual frameworks compatible with the then contemporaneous macroeconomic theory. In doing so, they bridged the analytical gap with the North-American developments whilst maintaining the key features of the CEPAL approach, such as distributional conflicts and local institutional details. These contributions eventually influenced the second moment of the monetarist-structuralist controversy that unraveled in the 1980s. The paper also highlights how later works by structuralist economists gradually stripped the inertial inflation approach of its previous substance and form, thereby unearthing tensions among Latin-American structuralists that led to the eventual decline of this research program.",TRUE,FALSE,|Celso Furtado|inertial inflation|James Tobin|Latin America stabilization,2019-01-28T23:06:41.750236,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Other Economics,History of Economics Society,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/citation/,gxy4n,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c4f0875bf723100197a642b/,5c4f0875bf723100197a642b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gxy4n/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gxy4n/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gxy4n,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although the cybersecurity scholarship had an initial promise to be the primus inter pares among these emerging fields, the main thrust of this new methodological innovation came through the ‘digital conflict studies’ sub-field. By integrating Internet and social media research tools and questions into its core topics of sub-national violence, terrorism and radical mobilization, digital conflict studies has recently succeeded in addressing some of the data validity and methodology problems faced by the cybersecurity scholarship. This article begins by briefly reviewing some of the persistent data and method-oriented hurdles faced by the cybersecurity scholarship. Then, it moves onto a more detailed account of how digital conflict studies have been addressing some of these deadlocks by focusing individually on the literature on onset, mobilization, targeting, intensity/duration and termination phases of conflicts. Ultimately, the article concludes with the suggestion that the cybersecurity scholarship could move past its own deadlocks by building more granular and dedicated research datasets and establishing mechanisms to share event data with the scientific community.",TRUE,FALSE,civil war|conflict studies|cybersecurity|digital media|international relations|internet research|political violence|social media,2019-05-06T16:00:03.106177,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-06,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj8gx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj8gx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj8gx/citation/,nj8gx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj8gx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj8gx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj8gx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccf83067788f50019a9674b/,5ccf83067788f50019a9674b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj8gx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj8gx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nj8gx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nj8gx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nj8gx,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The publication of this essay prompted many responses, including three public letters circulated within the mathematical sciences community. Each letter was signed by hundreds of people and was published online, also by the American Mathematical Society. We report on a study of the signatories' demographics, which we infer using a crowdsourcing approach. Letter A highlights diversity and social justice. The pool of signatories contains relatively more individuals inferred to be women and/or members of underrepresented ethnic groups. Moreover, this pool is diverse with respect to the levels of professional security and types of academic institutions represented. Letter B does not comment on diversity, but rather, asks for discussion and debate. This letter was signed by a strong majority of individuals inferred to be white men in professionally secure positions at highly research intensive universities. Letter C speaks out specifically against diversity statements, calling them ""a mistake,"" and claiming that their usage during early stages of faculty hiring ""diminishes mathematical achievement."" Individuals who signed both Letters B and C, that is, signatories who both privilege debate and oppose diversity statements, are overwhelmingly inferred to be tenured white men at highly research intensive universities.

A vital one was the presence of a need, initially that of how to get water out of mines and later how to drive the new machinery that was being produced as part of the industrial revolution. But needs are common and they are not always met. The reasons why those needs were met was due to the scientific progress that was going on in 16th and 17th century Europe concerning the knowledge of atmospheric pressure, how to create vacuums and of the properties of gases. Allied to this scientific progress was a belief in Europe at the time that progress could be made and problems could be solved. The inventors at the time applied scientific knowledge to solving the problems that existed and after long periods of trial and error, including the development of new and better materials, were able to produce a working steam engine. Crucial to the progress made by the inventors was the diffusion of scientific and engineering knowledge which enabled them to build on each other’s work.

It is cutting across various population boundaries and has almost assumed an endemic proportion. Its consequential impact on the standard language has acquired greater importance. This paper aims to determine the perceptions and attitudes of English Second Language (ESL) learners at Aligarh Muslim University towards the consequences of texting on Standard English. The data were collected through a five-point scale questionnaire from ninety students who were enrolled at Aligarh Muslim University during the academic year 2010-2011. The respondents completed a 16-item questionnaire. The students from which the data were collected were grouped according to their levels.

Yet unstudied is Western migration to the Philippines, a developing nation with numerous disadvantages for residents and from which many locals emigrate. The present study aimed to estimate numbers and demographic characteristics of Westerners living there and some motives for and outcomes of their move. From various embassy estimates, perhaps 218,350 Westerners not of Filipino descent lived in the Philippines in 2014. Some Western migrants were studied in- country and 134 completed a survey. Most survey respondents were well-educated male retirees who had paired up with a local woman. Major migration motives were low living costs, a warm climate, dislike of a home nation and availability of attractive partners. Reported outcomes of moving to the Philippines varied greatly. Some do not adjust well and quickly leave while others are dissatisfied but lack funds to exit. However, some apparently integrate well. Local impacts of the Western influx mainly seem slight to date but may grow.

The scholarship on radicalism largely portrays radical discourse as opposition to powerful ideas and enemies, but radicals often evince great interest in personal and local concerns. To shed light on how radicals use and adopt rhetoric, we analyze an original corpus of more than 23,000 pages produced by Afghan radical groups between 1979 and 2001 using a novel computational abductive approach. We first identify how radicalism not only attacks dominant ideas, actors, and institutions using a rhetoric of subversion, but also how it can use a rhetoric of reversion to urge intimate transformations in morals and behavior. Next, we find evidence that radicals’ networks of support affect the rhetorical mixture they espouse, due to social ties drawing radicals into encounters with backers’ social domains. Our study advances a relational understanding of radical discourse, while also showing how a combination of computational and abductive methods can help theorize and analyze discourses of contention.",TRUE,FALSE,Afghanistan|computational adductive analysis|radicalism|sociology of the future|text analysis,2019-04-17T13:41:44.055366,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/citation/,yfzsh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jx756/,jx756,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb6e4dd3992690017126cbc/,5cb6e4dd3992690017126cbc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yfzsh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yfzsh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yfzsh,https://doi.org/10.1177/0003122419859519,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Predictions were derived and tested from an evolutionary psychology (EP) perspective, a social–cognitive perspective, and the double-shot perspective. The data were not consistent with the EP predictions because men tended to respond in the predicted manner in only the U.S. student samples, whereas the rest of the data were largely consistent with the social–cognitive theory. Specifically, both sexes tended to be more upset by emotional than sexual infidelity when forced to choose which type of infidelity was more distressing. Both sexes indicated that sexual infidelity was more distressing than emotional when asked to rate their level of distress separately for each using continuous measures. The lesbian and gay samples were mostly consistent with the double-shot hypothesis because they tended to respond based on stereotyping grounded in the sex of their partner, paralleling heterosexuals in this regard. Analysis of the scenarios designed to test the double-shot hypothesis found somewhat smaller effects when the possibility of both types of infidelity was ruled out. These findings suggest that professionals seeking to address problems associated with jealousy in romantic relationships would profit from avoiding sex-linked assumptions about which aspect of infidelity is likely to be more upsetting.",TRUE,FALSE,emotional jealousy|evolutionary psychology|infidelity|jealousy|sex differences|sexual jealousy|social-cognitive theory,2019-01-13T18:46:05.292231,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology,Christopher J.

One dimension of precarious work of growing interest to scholars and policymakers is instability faced by workers in the amount and regularity of their work hours. However, we know little about the magnitude of month-to-month or week-to-week (intra-year) volatility in hours worked, the extent of class-based polarization in this measure of job quality, and whether worker power moderates this polarization. In this paper, we make novel use of the panel nature of the nationally-representative Current Population Survey (CPS) to estimate intra-year volatility in the actual hours respondents report working in the previous week across four consecutive survey months. Using this new measure, we then show that, net of demographic characteristics and controls for occupation and industry, low-wage workers experience disproportionately greater work hour volatility. Finally, we find evidence that reductions in marketplace bargaining power--as measured by higher state-level unemployment rates--increase wage- and education-based polarization in work hour volatility, while increases in associational power--as measured by union coverage--reduce wage-based polarization in work hour volatility.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-02-11T04:41:27.729159,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/citation/,rzfg2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c60f11476653c0019271c60/,5c60f11476653c0019271c60,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rzfg2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rzfg2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rzfg2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

markets. This claim is based on earlier studies showing that the ethnic gap is smaller for users with reviews than for
users without reviews. Using simulations, we show that this conclusion may be premature, as reviews can only be
written after completed interactions. Hence, initial differences between users in the probability to be selected as transaction partner may accumulate over time, thereby diminishing the potential of reputation systems to decrease

Evidence from the German Family Panel,"A growing body of evidence suggests that imbalanced local sex ratios are correlated with social consequences, including the pattern and timing of union formation, fertility and relationship stability. Scholars have argued that these findings can be understood as a result of imbalances in the bargaining power the respective sex holds in male- or female-skewed regions, but they remain vague on the underlying mechanisms. Specifically, the literature implicitly considers individual partner market experiences to be a function of local sex ratios. However, empirical evidence on the correspondence between subjective partner availability and local sex ratios remains scarce. This study addresses this gap by linking individual-level German longitudinal survey data (pairfam) with local sex ratios from population data for different entities (states, counties, and municipalities). Using multilevel regression models, this paper analyses the correlations between a subjective partner market indicator and a variety of local sex ratio measures. Moreover, an event history analysis explored how either indicator relates transitions into relationships. Results revealed that none of the local sex ratio measures, including those for narrow age ranges and/or lower level administrative entities, significantly predicted whether individuals predominantly met individuals of their own sex. Event history models yielded significant correlations between this subjective partner market indicator and relationship formation for both genders, substantiating the validity of the subjective indicator. For local sex ratios, results revealed an additional association between local sex ratios and female relationship formation when the sex ratios were adjusted for age hypergamy. Male relationship formation was uncorrelated with any local sex ratio. Both evolutionary and social scientific reasoning on the consequences of sex ratio imbalances rest on assumptions of subjective partner availability that may not be adequately represented by local sex ratios. Future research should be careful not to equate local sex ratios and conscious partner market experiences.",TRUE,FALSE,mating|pairfam|partner market|relationship formation|sex ratio,2019-04-17T13:38:28.219770,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17,FALSE,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/citation/,vs9r3,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb5d0f4f2be3c001602c477/,5cb5d0f4f2be3c001602c477,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vs9r3/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vs9r3/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vs9r3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Evolutionary game theoretic models represent individual’s thought processes by strategy update protocols. The most common of these are random mutation, individual learning, selective imitation, and myopic optimization. Recently we introduced a new strategy update protocol - foresight - which takes into account future payoffs, and how groupmates respond to one’s own strategies. Here we apply our approach to a new 2x2 game, where one player, a leader, ensures via inspection and punishment that the other player, a subordinate, produces collective good. We compare the levels of inspection and production predicted by Nash Equilibrium, Quantal Response Equilibrium, level-k cognition, fictitious play, reinforcement learning, selective imitation, and foresight. We show that only foresight and selective imitation are effective at promoting contribution by the subordinate and inspection and punishment by the leader. The role of selective imitation in cultural and social evolution is well appreciated.

Departing instead from (fugitive) theories and practices of (under)commoning from peoples (presumed to be) excluded from ‘modernity’ suggests however there is much more and less to the picture than is often presented, and perhaps, following Benjamin (2001[1940]), it’s the past to (and from) which we should look in our efforts of and for futurity. Cautious against the often totalising and universalising accounts that constitute much of ‘radical left’ (or whatever) thought, this thesis instead recognises those insurgent and inventive intensities that remain elusive(ly everywhere), fugitive and excess yet never forgotten despite the serial efforts of (the) settlement.

We set out a research agenda for answering the question of how platform power is held accountable that is both empirical and normative. Empirically, we emphasize the need to trace how accountability actually operates in practice. What accountability mechanisms exist, how are they used by publics, how do platforms respond, and with what effects? At the same time, we outline a normative agenda to investigate what genuine accountability requires and how existing accountability practices compare to this standard. Informed by deliberative approaches to democracy, and drawing in particular on Rainer Forst’s work on justification, we argue that the accountability of platforms is a question of their power being justified adequately to affected publics and that this depends on the quality of the discursive processes through which decisions about platforms are justified. Focusing on the quality of discursive processes allows us to distinguish critically between cases where publics merely accept platform power, unreflectively and in contexts of limited information and choice, to cases where power is justified through good reasons tested through inclusive public discourse.",TRUE,FALSE,Internet governance|Internet regulation|platform accountability|platform governance|platform regulation,2019-11-15T07:52:41.772841,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Communication Technology and New Media,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/citation/,tx2db,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dccd4107cbfdf000c9d4f6c/,5dccd4107cbfdf000c9d4f6c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tx2db/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tx2db/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tx2db,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In general, it is a space and place study. The thesis suggests that, Antoinette has some conditions and circumstances that she developed in an autonomic manner with different experiences in order to navigate and recognize the dangerous and safe spaces around her. Wide Sargasso Sea, by Jean Rhys, elaborates a self-sacrifice experience that the protagonist went through in her search for identity, which she lost due to the circumstances around her. In this research, a psychological analysis of Antoinette's personality will be taken, moreover; an attempt is made to find out the reasons for her schizophrenic behavior. The research focuses on Antoinette's shattered identity and the specters she faced in her life, which ultimately played a huge role in her madness. Also, the visible opposite aspects of black/white, rationality/unconsciousness, male/female, and sanity/madness are conceived by her conscious mind, and it causes the frantic thoughts of insanity, womanhood, and blackness. Also, it sheds light on Antoinette's journey in life to figure out where she belongs and her struggle in this search. Antoinette's personality and identity crisis as a Creole girl will be discussed in depth. There are different areas that are explored in this paper; such as the interpretation of how the surrounding spaces affect Antoinette and the reasons behind the absence of a loving mother in Wide Sargasso Sea. Furthermore, Rochester's character is also examined to find out how the masculine space differs from feminine space, and to what extent Mr. Rochester's cruelty harms Antoinette. Another important thing that is discussed in the paper is the effect of family relationships on a person's identity, and how it becomes a reason of mental disorder.",TRUE,FALSE,Black|Identity|Madness|Schizophrenic behavior|Spaces|White,2019-07-20T21:26:05.014568,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/citation/,dsgxj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5cfdbb76653c001b2cc625/,5c5cfdbb76653c001b2cc625,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgxj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dsgxj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dsgxj,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.228,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While our focus is in the energy sector, we also plan to draw on evidence (where relevant) from examples of sharing economy models in non-energy sectors.

We set out where and how we will seek to identify evidence (through online searching, reference checking and calling for evidence). In line with our exploratory and iterative approach, we propose broad inclusion criteria. We will assess evidence quality subjectively on the basis of relevance and rigour for each Context-Mechanism-Outcome group, not at document level.

Having critiqued white gay men for colluding in the maintenance of white supremacy, I conclude by brainstorming what a radically antiracist approach to queer desire might look like.

The study addresses the following research questions: what are the linguistic, social-cultural, mistrust and communication-related barriers that are encountered by interpreters and language assistants in conflict zones, how do they cope with these challenges, and what could be done to train them to handle such challenges and difficulties. The study adopted a qualitative methodology with semi-structured interviews being the main method of data collection. Twenty participants agreed to voluntarily take part in the investigation by allowing face-to-face interviews. Interview data was transcribed, coded and analyzed thematically. The results of data analysis showed that participants faced a range of challenges that negatively affected their job. They reported difficulties understanding and dealing with some social and cultural issues specific to the region. They also reported some serious life-threatening incidents ranging from physical and verbal attacks. For example, interpreters encountered hostilities from their fellow citizens accusing them of siding with enemy parties involved in the conflicts. Additionally, communication barriers were reported by participants as being the most salient challenge they experienced even when they interpreted accurately, as they would still encounter communication breakdowns caused by the inherent differences in the indigenous languages and varieties in addition to some cultural barriers.

The analysis revealed that a majority of heterosexuals hold ambivalent attitudes about gay and lesbian rights. Moreover, results from a multinomial logistic regression imply that Barbadians whose views on sexuality were theologically based were less likely to support restrictions on same-sex intimacy when they have a close relationship with a gay man or lesbian.

A simultaneous discussion on the role of automation in unemployment complicates the political narrative; by one estimate, 47% of American jobs are at risk of computerization (Frey and Osborne, 2013). This study analyzes how occupational automation corresponds with racial and ethnic demographics within occupational groups from both a historical and contemporary perspective. I find that throughout American industrialization, non-White and immigrant workers shifted to low-wage, unskilled work because of the political and social limitations imposed upon these groups.

Estimates of the global incidence of dengue infections per year have ranged between 50 million and 200 million; however, recent estimates using cartographic approaches suggest this number is closer to almost 400 million.

Testing a Salience Model on German Service Sector Employees,"The present study tested an extended version of Voydanoff's (2004) 'differential salience vs. comparable salience' model in a sample of German service workers. Our findings partially support the model in a different national/cultural context but also yielded some divergent findings with respect to within-domain resources and boundary-spanning demands. In line with the theoretical framework, work-to-home interference (WHI) mainly occurred because of high work demands and not because of a lack of work resources. Boundary-spanning resources yielded comparable potential to reduce WHI and enhance work-to-home enrichment (WHE). WHE was expected to more likely occur due to the activation of work resources rather than the absence of work demands. However, control over one's work did not have a significant impact on WHE.

In this letter, we demonstrate two results. First, we derive bounds for the bias in non-spatial models with omitted spatially-lagged predictors or outcomes. These bias expressions can be obtained without prior knowledge of the network, and are more informative than familiar omitted variable bias formulas. Second, we derive bounds for the bias in spatial econometric models with non-differential error in the specification of the weights matrix. Under these conditions, we demonstrate that an omitted spatial input is the limit condition of including a misspecificed spatial weights matrix. Simulated experiments further demonstrate that spatial models with a misspecified weights matrix weakly dominate non-spatial models.

This paper determines the availability and accessibility of 3D printing technology in low-income communities through public libraries and gives insights on how libraries use 3D printers. By examining the 2013 Digital Inclusion Survey and conducting interviews, we found that libraries are quickly acquiring 3D printers; however, the technology is not being fully adopted by the patrons due to the lack of training, software and practical applications of the technology. Also, we found out that the cost to use a 3D printer in public libraries is relatively low, and does not prevent patrons from accessing the technology.

Variants of this MC model are being implemented in more than 60 different countries of the world. It has become almost a universal antidote for poverty especially from 2006 when Professor Muhammad Yunus- the founder of the Grameen Bank (GB) and the bank itself shared the Nobel peace prize. Although the GB is the pioneer of MC program in Bangladesh, there are many other non-governmental organizations (NGO)s that offer the same program in Bangladesh in different forms and names. The providers of MCs claim that the overwhelming majority of the borrowers are using the loan funds profitably for productive purposes, repaying the loans and interest regularly, and thus improving their socio-economic conditions steadily. The findings of the present study are somewhat contrary and disturbing to the claim of the MC programs. This study finds that a bulk of the MC is borrowed for non productive purposes. About one quarter of the borrowers use the credit exclusively for consumption and debt repayment purposes. Nearly half of them use the credits entirely for investment purposes. For all, the return on investment is very meager. About two-third of the borrowers, on average have an impressive 83% net return on investment available for payment of interest and dividend in addition to the principal. But in case of as high as one third of them, average return on investment is not enough even to cover the most minimum or tolerance level of wages for family labors, let alone paying any interest and making any profit after keeping aside the principal.",TRUE,FALSE,implicit cost of labor|microcredit|microenterprise|Microlending|small business,2019-02-20T19:29:02.447801,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/citation/,xh9na,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/9hq4g/,9hq4g,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6d150d62c82a001ad6442b/,5c6d150d62c82a001ad6442b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xh9na/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xh9na/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xh9na,https://doi.org/10.2753/0577-5132510608,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Yet as admission to selective colleges has become increasingly competitive, a market for services to help students succeed in the application process has rapidly expanded. When is participation in this market understood to be morally legitimate? Research on moral markets has examined how participants distinguish legitimate from illegitimate markets, and how relational strategies can hide or purify illegitimate transactions. Less attention has been paid to why groups define a market as legitimate, particularly when its existence conflicts with other group values. Drawing on digital ethnography of an online forum for current and prospective Taiwanese international students and interviews with forum participants, we find that participants define the purchase of college admissions services as moral when it is compensating for collective disadvantage, yet reject its morality in other contexts. Paying to beat a “meritocratic” system becomes legitimate when one recognizes one’s systematic disadvantage in that system.

A Field Study Examining Religiosity and Social Capital in Tunisia,"The present study sheds light upon critical factors that help explain the entrepreneurial success among Muslim women living in a democratic Tunisia, a Muslim-majority country considered by many to be the lone Arab Spring success story. We hypothesized that successful entrepreneurs need social capital, including the capital that comes from marriage and high levels of wasta (the Arabic concept of having personal connections with influential others). Moreover, given the lack of empirical attention paid to the role of the culture, language, and customs associated with Islam on women’s empowerment, we examine whether religiosity is related to entrepreneurial performance among Tunisian women. Data collected with 84 female entrepreneurs participating in entrepreneurship training programs across Tunisia reveal that two forms of social capital, marital status and wasta, are related to training center directors’ ratings of women entrepreneurs’ performance, suggesting that social capital is a critical asset for Muslim women entrepreneurs. Religiosity, on the other hand, had no statistically significant relationship with entrepreneurial performance. Our study contributes to research on entrepreneurship by identifying wasta as a form of social capital that may be necessary for women entrepreneurs to succeed in the Middle East and North Africa and by taking an initial step towards better understanding the empirical (and controversial) relationship between religiosity and career success among Muslim women. We recommend that training organizations supporting entrepreneurs directly assist women in the development of social capital and acknowledge, rather than ignore, that nepotism and wasta are linked to entrepreneurial success in some cultures.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab world|entrepreneurs|human capital|Islam|marital status|religiosity|self-employment|social capital|spirituality|Tunisia|wasta,2019-03-16T20:13:49.639382,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Industrial and Organizational Psychology,Lisa Baranik|Brandon Gorman|and William J.

Bucke and Schleiermacher cited three forms of consciousness: Animal or Brutish Self-awareness, Sensual or Self-Consciousness, and Cosmic Consciousness. While examining the poetry of indigenous people, Palestinians and Native Americans, we find out that the majority moves within the confines of the Sensual or Self-Consciousness in their reaction to the brutish consciousness of the oppressors who deny their unalienable rights for life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness. Unlike others, Mahmoud Darwish, the Palestinian, and Joy Harjo, the Native American, attempt to transcend the sensual consciousness and adopt a broader universal vision or cosmic consciousness; however, their peaceful vision is often shattered by bitter realities and frustrated by the inhuman conduct of their oppressors.

The results are as follows: During the early Ratanakosin period, only one piece of Thai poetry recording the lives of two Hindu Indians fighting over a Melayu woman was written using a Thai setting. In the Middle Ratanakosin period, one renowned book about India recounted the visit of a young King Rama V of Siam to India to experience and learn from the positive and negative experience of colonized countries. His Majesty was inspired by that visit and reformed Siam (former name of Thailand) into a dynastic state with numerous new economic political and social developments. In the current Ratanakosin period of rampant globalization, “Indianness” presented in the settings and protagonists are plotted in many Thai novels mixing with “Thainess” through Thai or Indian-Thai characterisation and aspects of culture and concepts related to Hinduism and Buddhism. “Dharma” and “Karma” are the main key reflections found in Thai works.

With Fake Learners, They Might Not Be!","The rich data that Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) platforms collect on the behavior of millions of users provide a unique opportunity to study human learning and to develop data-driven methods that can address the needs of individual learners. This type of research falls into the emerging field of learning analytics. However, learning analytics research tends to ignore the issue of the reliability of results that are based on MOOCs data, which is typically noisy and generated by a largely anonymous crowd of learners. This paper provides evidence that learning analytics in MOOCs can be significantly biased by users who abuse the anonymity and open-nature of MOOCs, for example by setting up multiple accounts, due to their amount and aberrant behavior. We identify these users, denoted fake learners, using dedicated algorithms. The methodology for measuring the bias caused by fake learners’ activity combines the ideas of Replication Research and Sensitivity Analysis. We replicate two highly-cited learning analytics studies with and without fake learners data, and compare the results. While in one study, the results were relatively stable against fake learners, in the other, removing the fake learners’ data significantly changed the results.

The social stratification of food consumption profiles in Italy, 1997-2016","Using data from the Multiporpose Survey of Daily Life by ISTAT, this paper analyses the profiling and social stratification of food consumption among Italian adults from 1997 to 2016. We first apply Latent Class Analysis on a set of central food categories of the Mediterranean diet to document the existence of six consumption clusters, (herbivore, carnivore, hedonist, enhanced Mediterranean, paucivore, omnivore) and their relative size over time. Second, we employ fractional response models to illustrate how gender and education are associated with each of the identified clusters. Finally, we use variance-weighted least square regressions to document the evolution of gender and education gradients over time.
Results point to an increase in the relative size of the herbivores and omnivores, a substantial stability of the hedonists and paucivores, and a decline of the carnivores and enhanced Mediterraneans. Moreover, our findings highlight a substantial social stratification of food profiles and show that, within a broad picture of persistence, gender and education became more important in affecting the propensity of adopting certain profiles. Women and upper educated individuals are more likely to belong to clusters characterised by daily fruit and vegetable consumption. Moreover, women are also less likely to belong to clusters defined by the presence of alcoholics and soft drinks. In addition, the gap between upper and lower educated individuals in the probability of belonging to the omnivore profile, and the gap between women and men in the probability of belonging to the herbivore and hedonist profiles have increased over time.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural stratification|eating patterns|food consumption|health stratification|latent class analysis|omnivore-univore,2019-09-24T12:14:24.188731,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-24,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d85|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Food Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e36|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Consumers and Consumption|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Filippo Oncini &amp; Moris Triventi,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/citation/,32x6m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d88e06f53713d00191c03f6/,5d88e06f53713d00191c03f6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/32x6m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/32x6m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/32x6m,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They can also recreate their own identities in the course of their interaction. This study investigates ways in which the identities of speakers can be revealed by their use of language in multiple-participant conversations. In particular, the study aims to elicit the strategies that speakers employ the most by analysing the way they talk at a micro-analytic level, and the ways in which they organise and sequence their turns at talking. The results show that the processes of turn-taking and topic development are subject to distraction and breakdown in computer-mediated environments. There are many instances of pauses caused by frequent overlaps between participants. The accents of participants are considered the main feature which can constitute one’s identity in voice-based chat-rooms.

With the dawn of technology and its various tools, exploring pronunciation and its effectiveness in successful communication attracts a bunch of scholarly attention. The use of Computer Assisted Language Learning opens the gateway for the possibility to integrate other tools in language learning as mobiles and gives birth to mobile learning or free education. In this vein, the incentive behind the current research work is in twofold:  to investigate the attitudes of both teachers and students towards the inclusion of mobiles in language learning, and to prove the effectiveness of this new approach in improving the listening and speaking skills of foreign language learners. To fulfill these aims, the researcher held an interview with 15 teachers teaching English at Dr Moulay Tahar University of Saida. The researcher also conducted a pretest and a posttest with 95 students of the second year from the same university. To this end, the findings revealed that both teachers and students have positive attitudes towards the introduction of mobile technology in language learning, even though some teachers still favor the traditional approaches of language teaching and learning. The results also demonstrated that the applications, used in the experiment, showed the usability of Mobile Assisted Language in learning English pronunciation.",TRUE,FALSE,Attitudes|EFL Learners|English pronunciation|Mobile Assisted Language Learning,2019-08-04T20:57:22.052337,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/citation/,6ks52,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4732f5bcd6d9001692a1bd/,5d4732f5bcd6d9001692a1bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ks52/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ks52/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ks52,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/call5.9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This manuscript incorporates two important, though ignored features in past research by inves- tigating how time shapes the properties of belief networks for different populations of people – those who exhibit high and low levels of political knowledge. Subsequent analysis produces several findings: (1) belief network density increases asymmetrically among people with high relative to low knowledge; (2) symbolic preferences are always more central to belief networks irrespective of survey timing or popula- tion; in contrast, policy beliefs exhibit some increase in centrality over time among the politically knowl- edgeable; and, (3) centrality does not predict variance within standard parametric models.

One of the most challenging tests faced by Saudi students in their studies, is the summative speaking test. The test is consisting of three tasks in which students required to go through them all. Accordingly, there is a need to seek approaches to enhance students’ performance in the speaking test. In other words, formative assessment has not been used to overcome the challenges faced by the Saudi students at Taibah University in the speaking test. This research aims to investigate whether a formative speaking assessment has a significant impact on students’ performance in the summative test. Also, it aims to monitor student learning and to provide constructive feedback that can be used by teachers to improve students’ learning and help the students to identify their strengths and weaknesses in speaking skills.

Library of Porto, held on the 24th November 1945, sets the motto for the construction of
a historically and sociologically based analysis of the modes of usage of public and semi-
public space – namely libraries – used by women and their meanings in those days.
Within the framework of a qualitative approach, sources such as literature, photography
and personal interviews are added to documentary data from institutional archives. A
fictional narrative, built from historical data, is inserted to sustain our analysis, where
Adozinda is the character embodying a woman reader who crosses the city to visit the
recently inaugurated Feminine Reading Room. Two female figures punctuate this narrative,
Virgínia de Castro e Almeida, the person after whom this room was named, and Tília Dulce
Machado Martins, the main legator of the collection it holds. Using this fictional narrative,
we aimed at reconstructing a holistic context for the facts as they might have happened
through a pleasurable reading of a plausible text. These women’s diverse histories are
also inserted in that context.
Fiction is a resource used to inscribe data on the social, economic, and political situation
in the city and in the country at that time, with an emphasis on women and their uses of
public space.
As to the theoretical framing of public and semi-public use of the space, the theory of
gendered spaces, as opposed to separate spheres, is evoked and confirmed to account
for the presence of women in public space, according to gender and social class roles, a
presence which is however socially invisibilised.
We conclude that the Room’s space, initially segregated for moral reasons, was later
transformed through an appropriation which went from separatism to integration, as a
response to ethical claims gaining ground in society. This separatism was, therefore, an
intermediate step towards a more equalitarian use of space.",TRUE,FALSE,gendered space|Portugal|public libraries|public space|the New State regime|women,2019-08-09T22:04:26.797393,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/citation/,ybnvh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4b12900f488d00168eba09/,5d4b12900f488d00168eba09,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ybnvh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ybnvh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ybnvh,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The aim of the present paper is to investigate how translators deal with English 'there' sentences in two translated Arabic texts. The method adopted in the study is a descriptive-analytic one. In Arabic the words 'hunaaka' and 'tammata' are usually used to render English 'there' ; however, the data of the study show that in many cases translators avoid using  these two words. The flexibility of word order in Arabic , in addition to the use of full lexical verbs , more frequently than English does in 'there' sentences , help to translate these sentences adequately into Arabic. It is also found that syntactic restrictions are not the only reason for the fact that many 'there' sentences are not translated using 'hunaaka' and ' tammata'; the discourse and stylistic levels, play a role in the translator's decision to use other means. In some cases, the use of 'hunaaka /tammata' is shown to be optional and in other cases to be obligatory, unless an alternative construction is produced.

s8z6u,preprints,2019-08-21,2021-03-01,2019-08-22,NA,NA,How to align disciplinary ideals with actual practices: Transparency and openness in archaeological science,"Archaeology is a highly diverse community of researchers without universally adopted methods,concepts, or theoretical perspectives. One ideal that unites us is that we typically perceive of ourselves as contributing to the public good by helping to understand and preserve the past (Chippindale 1994). We act as stewards for archaeological sites and artefacts, and we work to correct misinformed views of the past that might have sinister motives. However, many of the current norms of archaeological practice are at odds with these ideals of archaeology. We share relatively little of our research with each other or the public. Typically we produce a journal article or monograph as a final product, but we rarely share the data files or computational methods that generated those final products, nor do we share our written work in ways that are readily accessible to the public. This suggests a gap between current practice and ideals. It also limits the reproducibility of our research, and the efficiency with which new methods can spread through the discipline. We show that an exploration of this mismatch between ideals and practice can reveal untapped potential for digital tools in archaeology to improve its sustainability as a research domain, and indicate new ways to engage with the public. We describe emerging norms in archaeology, and some new digital tools that archaeologists are using, that are helping to close the gap between ideals and current practices.",TRUE,FALSE,archaeology|ethics|openscience|stewardship,2019-08-22T15:33:01.636655,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-22,FALSE,NA,available,NA,http://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/RHVN5,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/citation/,s8z6u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/sbmt2/,sbmt2,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5d9a27bc2a23001986d662/,5d5d9a27bc2a23001986d662,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s8z6u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s8z6u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s8z6u,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The expanding role of experts and institutions in managing risks has come at a time of declining public trust in institutions and a legitimacy crisis around expert knowledge. What happens when these tendencies collide? Previous scholarship has examined how disaster arises through failures of foresight, and how cultural-cognitive biases can prevent actors from seeing disasters coming. Less is known about the mobilization of resistance against risk management policies. This theoretical essay examines a particular category of that resistance: conspiracist discourse that frames risk as emanating primarily from perceived secret agendas of institutions and experts that explicitly claim to be acting in the public interest. This essay argues that conspiracy thinking can be best understood as rooted in a “populist risk imaginary,” which is rooted in negative asymmetry, a cultural-cognitive bias that foregrounds the possibility of worst-case outcomes. Conspiracy discourse can be understood as the “dark side” of negative asymmetry, which is otherwise used by service-oriented professionals to sharpen their foresight in preempting future dangers.",TRUE,FALSE,anticipation|culture and cognition|politics|risk|the future,2019-06-13T12:03:42.928151,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/citation/,7pj6y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0225fd35988f0018de3baa/,5d0225fd35988f0018de3baa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7pj6y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7pj6y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7pj6y,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12547,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

By applying fixed-effects models to data from the adult cohort of the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), the study finds that respondents report more egalitarian views to female interviewers.

The effect of weather on the intensity and spatial distribution of crime,"Despite an extensive literature on weather and crime, the magnitude of weather effects on crime and their implications for practical policing remain unclear. Similarly, the effects of weather on the location of crime have barely been explored empirically. We investigated how weather influences the intensity and spatial distribution of crime in Oslo, the capital of Norway. Geocoded locations of criminal offences were combined with data on temperature, wind, and rain. We used negative binomial count models to assess the effect of weather on the intensity of crime and generalized additive models (GAMs) to test for spatial variations. The intensity and spatial distribution of crime were not very sensitive to weather in Oslo. The largest effect was for drug crimes, for which maximum relative to minimum temperature was related to a single incident increase every six days. No effects were found for dislocation in the spatial models. In Oslo, Norway, weather conditions are of little importance for practical policing.

In this paper we provide the first public evaluation of the redistribution of taxing rights associated with the leading proposals of the OECD, IMF and the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporate Taxation (ICRICT).

Another benefit of CCTV though is its utility in investigations and in clearing cases, which has been much less studied. Using a sample of public crimes and case clearances in Dallas, Texas, we examine the efficacy that public CCTV cameras increase case clearance rates using a pre-post research design. We find that cases closer to cameras did have an increased clearance rate after the cameras were installed in Dallas. But the effects faded quite quickly in space, and were mostly limited to thefts. While our estimates here suggest the cameras are likely not cost-effective in this sample in terms of increasing clearances, it suggests there is potential to be more targeted in camera placement that might provide better justification for their (limited) use.",TRUE,FALSE,arrests|CCTV|crime-clearance|police-technology,2019-08-16T13:37:04.058975,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/citation/,eh5bg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5596bf6e9c70001bfe5a3a/,5d5596bf6e9c70001bfe5a3a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/eh5bg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/eh5bg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/eh5bg,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Research on student loans has focused on quantitative estimation of the effects of borrowing on educational attainment, economic well-being, health, and life course milestones. Drawing on sixty interviews with respondents working as lawyers in the northeastern U.S., we argue that student loans also have underappreciated relational effects, even for relatively privileged borrowers. Relational work around student loans is particularly visible during three important moments: the decision to borrow, the decision to partner, and when planning children’s futures. While scholars have examined the effects of borrowing on marriage and childbearing decisions, they have implicitly assumed that it is difficulty repaying that causes such effects. Attention to relational work, however, shows how debt can create additional burdens even when borrowers have the ability to repay, and may help explain why similar debt levels affect different groups differently.",TRUE,FALSE,culture|family|higher education|relational work|student loans,2019-11-01T19:38:27.327115,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-01,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgpj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgpj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgpj/citation/,dsgpj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgpj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgpj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgpj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dbc88debc32f4000f15cbed/,5dbc88debc32f4000f15cbed,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgpj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgpj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dsgpj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dsgpj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dsgpj,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The simultaneous and relatively rapid transitions that occur during gentrification make accounting for duration of exposure particularly important when exploring the relationship between gentrification and individual well-being. Though a large literature explores how the residential context, as well as the timing and duration of exposure to relatively stable neighborhood conditions, affects health, little is known about how duration of exposure to gentrification is linked to the health of longtime residents. Using restricted, longitudinal data from the Los Angeles Family and Neighborhood Survey, I ask (1) how is duration of exposure to gentrification linked to individual health? (2) How is gentrification differentially linked to individual health outcomes across ethnoracial groups? Results demonstrate that a longer duration of residence in a gentrifying neighborhood is associated with improved self-reported health.

While SNA-informed designs are often resource-intensive, they are uniquely able to help reach those most in need of HIV prevention and treatment interventions.

Background: Wealth can be an important resource to deal with the adverse economic consequences of union dissolution. Marital property regimes usually ensure that both partners receive a share of the couples’ wealth following a divorce. The dissolution of cohabiting unions is not governed by such rules in most countries, including Germany, which may lead to a more unequal division of wealth following the dissolution of cohabitation as compared to marriage.
Method: The analysis consists of multivariable fixed-effects regression models based on longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (N = 6,388 individuals) for the years 2002 to 2017.
Results: Changes in wealth are relatively similar for men and women after the dissolution of marriage. The dissolution of cohabiting unions is related to losses in wealth for women, but not for men. Controlling for post-dissolution processes, gender inequality increases after the dissolution of cohabitations.
Conclusion: Union dissolution is associated with wealth losses. The legal protection of the economically weaker spouse in marriage prevents gender inequality in these wealth losses. Lacking such legal protection, cohabitation is associated with gender inequality in the consequences of dissolution.",TRUE,FALSE,Cohabitation|Divorce|Gender Inequality|Separation|Wealth,2019-09-16T19:19:02.163398,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/citation/,rcuvd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7f6f8a710c95001e59b27a/,5d7f6f8a710c95001e59b27a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/rcuvd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/rcuvd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/rcuvd,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Results were very promising as they revealed significant improvement in the mean scores of the experimental group in the oral test as T-test value was (5.41). The evidence indicated that using instructional scaffolding strategies was effective as the ratio of effectiveness was (1.06).

The role of memorization and repetition of English language structures has always been a dominant teaching attitude. This attitude has revealed unsuccessful results in promoting speaking proficiency among English language learners when communicating in real-world situations beyond the classroom context. Therefore, it is essential to address such practices and shed light on some of the issues that hinder English Language Learners (ELLs) from effectively using English in real-world communicative situations. This review paper focuses on ELT practices that have been unsuccessful in promoting English language learners’ speaking proficiency. Additionally, it provides implications for classroom teaching instructions that integrate authentic tasks and materials. Implementing meaningful tasks that represent real-world situations could be a promising solution for enhancing ELLs’ language competencies to enable them to transfer the language they learn to real-life situations beyond school settings.

How academic obituaries consecrate research biographies,"Academics undertake considerable efforts in order to define positions for themselves and for their peers that are meaningful and convey who they “are”. The current article examines how academics manage the practical task of making sense of one another by analyzing the way in which academic obituaries beget and consecrate research biographies. A qualitative analysis of 216 obituaries published in academic journals from the United States, United Kingdom, and Germany, in physics, history, and sociology, and from the 1960s to the 2000s reveals (e)valuative practices that consecrate academic subjects. The results demonstrate how obituaries: (1) categorize academic subjects by positioning them within spheres of academic knowledge and institutional posts, and (2) legitimize academic subjects by applying biographical narratives of talent and merit. This biographical (e)valuation evokes naturally talented, highly devoted academic subjects with coherent research profiles, and omits both biographical hurdles and the decedent’s gender and class.

Issues pertaining to the origin of human cooperation have, however, been characterized by a forager bias, the assumption being that they have a close link to our evolutionary past. In contrast little effort has been spent on documenting and explaining cooperative herding among nomadic pastoralists. As the Mongolian empire attest to nomadic pastoralists—in contrast to foragers—can form large-scale empires. In combination with the prevalence of small-scale cooperative herding groups, nomadic pastoral societies thus provide a fertile ground for expanding our understanding of the evolution of cooperation.

The appeal of these plots is that they visualize confidence intervals around the estimates and generally center the plot around zero, meaning that any estimate that crosses zero is statistically non-significant at at least the alpha-level around which the confidence intervals are constructed. For models with statistical significance levels determined via randomization models of inference and for which there is no standard error or confidence intervals for the estimate itself, these plots appear less useful. In this paper, I illustrate a variant of the coefficient plot for regression models with p-values constructed using permutation tests. These visualizations plot each estimate's p-value and its associated confidence interval in relation to a specified alpha-level. These plots can help the analyst interpret and report both the statistical and substantive significance of their models.

The apparent lack of literature regarding the Aetas’ view on Usog and the health implications of this phenomenon prompted the researchers to explore the concept of Usog among the Aetas of Nabuclod, Pampanga. In this qualitative study, in-depth interviews were conducted to gather data from the respondents. Purposive sampling was used in the selection of subjects and informed consent was sought. Following the individual interviews with five different Aeta families, thematic analysis was done so as to identify the common emerging concept of Usog. It was found that the Aetas of Nabuclod see Usog as a transmittable mystical force primarily inflicted by humans and not by spirits. This force is said to be transferred unintentionally through eye or physical contact. Similarly, this usually affects infants, with crying fits as the most common symptom. The Aetas’ primary treatment for Usog was the use of Amyong as incense or decoction. The saliva of the inflictor of Usog, when applied on the abdomen or forehead of the afflicted infant was also seen as an effective remedy. The Aetas of Nabuclod, Pampanga see Usog as a transmittable mystical force unintentionally inflicted by humans through eye or physical contact, thereby producing physical symptoms among its victims.

The quasi-governmental Waterfront Toronto agency has partnered with the Alphabet subsidiary company Sidewalk Labs to plan and build out the neighborhood, essentially from the ground up, and embedded it with sophisticated technologies. The redevelopment plan details a digital layer made up of sensors that will collect and process locational information, tracking movement and usage patterns. Yet the project has been mired in controversy, mainly because of questions about data ownership and management. While there will be the amassing of an unfathomable amount of data, it is not clear who will control it and how it will be processed and used.  Critics of the project have pointed out that the potential value of the data is enormous and if a private company has exclusive domain over it, that company could decide to sell it at will. Securely storing citizen’s data is another problem. This paper provides a description of the popular newspaper accounts of the Waterfront Toronto Project. It discusses how the project and redevelopment authority came to be, how Alphabet be-came the primary partner, the redevelopment vision, and controversy that has engulfed this smart-city project.",TRUE,FALSE,canadian cities|data generation|digital privacy|smart cities|urban development,2019-06-12T21:26:47.386709,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgz2s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgz2s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgz2s/citation/,xgz2s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgz2s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgz2s/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgz2s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0134132a575b0017a12e51/,5d0134132a575b0017a12e51,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgz2s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgz2s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xgz2s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xgz2s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xgz2s,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This interaction and communication may appear in different language styles. This is much more influenced by a situation or place where communication takes place. In class, for example, the language utilized by lecturers in the class room is different from others. This research aims at exploring lecturers’ language style and its implication to student’s psychological condition in Indonesia. The main question in this research is what kind of language style used by the lecturer in the learning process? does the using of lecturers’ language style influence students’ psychological condition? What are the factors that affect the presence of lecturers’ language style? This research used the grounded theory method by Keraf language style theory (2006), perlocutionary act theory of Austin (1962), and Leech’s politeness theory (1983). This research was conducted at Institut Agama Islam Negeri Kendari, Indonesia. Observation, in-depth interviews, and documentation were used as data collection. The results indicated that (1) there were two kinds of lecturers’ language styles which are always delivered to students, namely language style based on sentence structures and language  style based on  directness and indirectness of  meaning (2)  the using of that language style has  a great influence  on students’ psychological  condition. There are three psychological conditions of the students, they are motivation, self-efficacy, and interpersonal relation.

The text-mining program searches 167,193 newspaper articles and 18,056 movie plots for over 35,000 job titles and codes them into standard U.S. Census occupational categories.  These occupations are then recoded into common definitions of the working class and tracked over time.  For The New York Times since 1980, recognition of working-class jobs has not declined, but it was always low.  For regional American papers like the St. Louis Post Gazette, the Detroit News, or the Tampa Bay Times, working-class occupations had once enjoyed higher levels of recognition, but the rates have declined recently to levels similar to the New York Times.

A total of 542 employees in various occupations completed online and offline surveys, including measures on sexist attitudes, job satisfaction, stress in general, and demographic background. Results indicated that gender discrimination is evident among Vietnamese working men and women and it significantly predicts their job satisfaction and mental health outcomes.

The Effect of Mohamed Salah on Islamophobic Behaviors and Attitudes,"Can exposure to celebrities from a stigmatized group reduce prejudice toward that group writ large? We estimate the causal effect of Mohammed Salah—a visibly Muslim soccer player— joining Liverpool Football Club on Islamophobia, using hate crime reports throughout England, 15 million tweets from British soccer fans, and a survey experiment of Liverpool F.C. fans. We find that hate crimes in Merseyside (home to Liverpool F.C.) dropped by 16% compared to a synthetic control, and Liverpool F.C. fans halved their rates of posting anti-Muslim tweets relative to fans of other top-flight clubs. Our survey experiment suggests that the salience of Salah’s Muslim identity enabled positive feelings toward Salah to generalize to Muslims more broadly.

The Role of Emotion, Race, and Politics in Social Movement Perceptions and Support","Scholars have long studied how social movements frame and deliver their messages, yet much less is known about how these “signals” are received by the public. In this study, we ask whether and how social movement members’ characteristics interact with a bystander’s to influence whether they support a particular protest movement. In addition, we examine how perceived likelihood of violence mediates these outcomes. We test five competing models based on previous theories of emotion, race, and political views in social movement support. To adjudicate between these frameworks, we conduct an experiment using a 2x2 factorial design in which participants read a news story about a protest accompanied by an image of a neutral/angry, white/Black protestor, measuring three types of social movement support. Results provide support for the politicized race model: a Black protestor is more motivating for liberals’ social movement support, while a white protestor is more motivating for conservatives.

The first report established a causal association between smoking and lung cancer, and subsequent reports expanded the list of smoking-attributable causes of death to include other cancers, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and respiratory diseases. For a second level of causes of death, the current evidence is suggestive but not sufficient to infer a causal relationship with smoking. This study draws on 1980–2004 U.S. vital statistics data and applies a cause-specific version of the Preston-Glei-Wilmoth indirect method, which uses the association between lung cancer death rates and death rates for other causes of death to estimate the fraction and number of deaths attributable to smoking overall and by cause. Nearly all of the established and additional causes of death are positively associated with lung cancer mortality, suggesting that the additional causes are in fact attributable to smoking. I find 420,284 annual smoking-attributable deaths at ages 50+ for years 2000–2004, 14% of which are due to the additional causes. Results corroborate recent estimates of cause-specific smoking-attributable mortality using prospective cohort data that directly measure smoking status. The U.S. Surgeon General should reevaluate the evidence for the additional causes and consider reclassifying them as causally attributable to smoking.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-11-09T16:39:22.536314,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-09,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Alcohol, Drugs, Tobacco|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/citation/,wf2b6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc6e6ac7f37e3000dcb5759/,5dc6e6ac7f37e3000dcb5759,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wf2b6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wf2b6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wf2b6,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2019.100349,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While these policies can increase the size of the electorate, they may also carry costs through changing electorate composition, by differentially enfranchising those who are highly sensitive to costs. Using new administrative data from South Africa and a difference-in-differences design, I show that a 15 year, large scale, expansion of access to voting stations increased national turnout by between 2.3 and 4.7 percentage points. In the context of a natural quasi-experiment, I then use 39,000 survey respondents geo-referenced to their nearest voting station to document that those of high socioeconomic status, and those who are older, are much more sensitive to electoral access than others.

New plant breeding techniques (NPBTs) provide a means to enhance PMF systems more quickly and with greater precision than ever before, and have the potential to produce health and health-related products that are superior to current mammalian systems. However, the feasibility, regulatory standing and social acceptability of both PMF and NPBTs are in question. This paper qualitatively explores the perceptions of key stakeholders on two European Union (EU) Horizon 2020 programmes – Pharma-Factory and Newcotiana – towards the barriers and facilitators of PMF and NPBTs in Europe. One-on-one qualitative interviews were undertaken with N=20 individuals involved in one or both of the two projects at 16 institutions in seven countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Israel, Spain and the UK). The findings indicate that the current EU regulatory environment and the perception of the public towards biotechnology are seen as the main barriers to scaling-up PMF and NPBTs. Competition from existing systems and the lack of plant-specific regulations likewise present challenges for PMF developing beyond its current niche. However, respondents felt that the communication of the benefits and purpose of NPBT PMF could provide a platform for improving the social acceptance of genetic modification. The importance of the media in this process was highlighted. This article explores the justifications used by scientists for the use of NPBTs for crop improvement and suggests that the multi-level perspective framework is a useful tool for understanding the systemic factors that have shaped the development of PMF up until today.",TRUE,FALSE,Barriers and Facilitators|New Plant Breeding Techniques|Plant Molecular Farming|Qualitative Research|Responsible Research and Innovation,2019-09-12T14:40:22.443175,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/citation/,gwve2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7a3ac79defac0017165714/,5d7a3ac79defac0017165714,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gwve2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gwve2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gwve2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The relevant literature on refugee politics has yet to fully explore how forced migration encourages host states to employ their position in order to extract revenue from other state or non-state actors for maintaining refugee groups within their borders. This article explores the workings of refugee rentier states, namely states seeking to leverage their position as host states of displaced communities for material gain. It focuses on the Syrian refugee crisis, examining the foreign-policy responses of three major host states – Jordan, Lebanon, and Turkey. While all three engaged in post-2011 refugee rent-seeking behavior, Jordan and Lebanon deployed a backscratching strategy based on bargains, while Turkey deployed a blackmailing strategy based on threats. Employing primary sources in English and Arabic, the article inductively examines how the choice of strategy depended on the host state’s size of refugee community and domestic elites’ perception of their state’s geostrategic importance vis-à-vis the target state(s). The article concludes with a discussion on the significance of its findings for understanding the international dimension of the Syrian refugee crisis and paves the way for future research on the effects of forced displacement on host states’ political development.",TRUE,FALSE,Arab migration|Arab world|Case Studies|Eastern Mediterranean|Forced Displacement|Mediterranean refugee crisis|Middle East|Migration|Migration Diplomacy|Refugee Diplomacy|Refugee Rentierism|Refugee Rentier States|Refugees|Rentier states|Rentier state theory|Syrian Civil War|Syrian refugees integration,2019-01-05T04:45:41.732996,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d94|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Near and Middle Eastern Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/citation/,a6s58,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2fb82c00b540001dfe0fd3/,5c2fb82c00b540001dfe0fd3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/a6s58/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/a6s58/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/a6s58,https://doi.org/10.1093/jogss/ogz016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We discuss the dynamics of pup play, demonstrating that it primarily consists of mimicking the behaviors and adopting the role of a dog. We show that the majority of participants use pup play for sexual satisfaction. It is also a form of relaxation, demonstrated primarily through the existence of a “headspace.”  We classify pup play as a kink, and find no evidence for the framing of it as a form of zoophilia.

Such scripts are amplified by a context in which a version of Islamic family law that envisions women as primarily domestic and men as household authorities and breadwinners has been institutionalized. However, this vision is also being challenged by women’s increasing educational attainment as well as competing egalitarian discourses of gender in Islam. The gendered religious scripts used by Muslim couples compensate for social changes that threaten to reshape both domestic and public life. I propose that how Muslim men and women talk about their marriages and households has become a key mechanism for accomplishing modern Muslim gender identities in a context where men’s authority is at risk. These dynamics may be especially prevalent in Muslim contexts where Islamic law is becoming more institutionalized in state bureaucracies and everyday life.",TRUE,FALSE,Family|Gender|Indonesia|Islam|Marriage|Muslim|Women,2019-05-23T21:20:14.185482,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,Rachel Rinaldo,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uhjf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uhjf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uhjf/citation/,9uhjf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uhjf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uhjf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uhjf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ce70cec2a50c400187bf634/,5ce70cec2a50c400187bf634,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uhjf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uhjf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9uhjf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9uhjf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9uhjf,https://doi.org/10.1093/socrel/sry045,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It investigates the value of EFL within the Saudi education system and surveys the extent to which English has been adapted to suit the needs and customs of Saudi citizens. While focusing on major policy issues related to planning and implementing EFL instruction, the paper examines how stakeholders have worked to preserve Saudi culture, Arabic, and the structure of Saudi society. It seeks to determine whether EFL courses in Saudi schools meet the needs of students, the results of which are compared with Saudi policies on language teaching. The study then presents observations on the compatibility of teaching practices and policies, as well as the issues involved. Saudi Arabia faces several challenges that have greatly hindered the planning and implementation of language-teaching policies.

This study focuses on the content of Twitter messages related to the 2016 terrorist attack on the Berlin Christmas market. We complement the collective sense-making perspective with the terror management theory (TMT) perspective to understand why people used Twitter in the aftermath of the attack. We use structural topic modeling to analyze our dataset of 51,000 tweets. Our results indicate that people used Twitter to make sense of the events and as part of typical reactions in TMT, that is, to validate their own worldviews and maintain their self-esteem. In accordance with TMT, we found that people used Twitter to search for meaning and value, show sympathy for victims and their families, or call for tolerance, but also to express nationalistic sentiment and greater hostility toward values and views other than their own. We further show that topics varied over the course of the attack and in the days that followed. Whereas in the first two days there were many emotion-related tweets and operational updates, subsequent days saw more opinion-related tweets.

This paper uses complete death certificate data from the Mortality Multiple Cause Files with American Community Survey data to examine age-specific mortality rates for married and non-married people from 2007 to 2017. The overall rise in White mortality is limited almost exclusively to those who are not married, for men and women. By comparison, mortality for Blacks and Hispanics has fallen or remained flat regardless of marital status (except for young, single Hispanic men). Analysis by education level shows death rates have risen most for Whites with the lowest education, but have also increased for those with high school or some college. Because mortality has risen faster for unmarried Whites at all but the lowest education levels, there has been an increase in the marriage mortality ratio.

This is both theoretically and normatively appealing, suggesting that European party politics operates in a way that is consistent with spatial models. Nonetheless, virtually all previous studies are based on a single, uni-dimensional measure of public opinion: left-right self-placement from the Eurobarometer surveys. This measure has a number of flaws, including the fact that political conflict in Europe now occurs across multiple issue dimensions beyond the classic divide on state involvement in the economy. We use new measures of Europeans' ideological positions across four different issue dimensions and twenty-six countries from 1981-2016, together with data on parties' policy positions from their manifestos, to re-evaluate findings on responsiveness. Across many different model specifications, samples and outcome measures, we find virtually no evidence that European political parties respond to public opinion on any issue dimension.

We use data from the 1996 and 2014 General Social Surveys and consider relative political tolerance toward old-fashioned racists (i.e., persons who believe black Americans are genetically inferior) compared to other historically stigmatized groups, including anti-religionists, communists, militarists, and homosexuals. Viewing Christian identity as essential to American civic belonging is among the strongest predictors of whites’ being politically intolerant of all stigmatized groups, racists included. However, when we examine relative tolerance toward racists compared to other stigmatized groups, white Christian nationalists show greater tolerance than other whites. This effect is distinct from personal religiosity which is associated with lower relative tolerance toward racists. Additionally, we find both survey year and gender moderate the association between white Christian nationalism and relative tolerance toward racists. Findings ultimately demonstrate that white Americans who adhere to Christian nationalism exhibit authoritarian tendencies―expressing lower tolerance for all groups considered―while making greater relative allowance for old-fashioned racists, who may be allies in the task of social control and coercion.",TRUE,FALSE,blacks|political tolerance|racism|racists|religion|Trump|White Christian nationalism|whites,2019-09-19T11:57:23.437077,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/citation/,kw73j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d824bcb0d263000190bd216/,5d824bcb0d263000190bd216,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kw73j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kw73j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kw73j,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, studies of the timing, prevalence, and nature of home-leaving do not generally incorporate the full range of experiences that young adults increasingly face—such as military service and incarceration. With the growing prevalence and uneven distribution of these institutional experiences, consideration of the role these institutions play in the home-leaving transition becomes increasingly important to our understanding of this life event. This study uses life table analysis of the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth to compare estimates of the timing and cumulative risk of first home-leaving by age 27 using conventional and institution-inclusive definitions of home-leaving. I find that the institution-inclusive definition of home-leaving yields earlier and higher overall risks of first home-leaving by age 27 and that there is meaningful racial/ethnic variation in the types of transitions young adults make when they leave the parental home for the first time.",TRUE,FALSE,1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth|emerging adulthood|family|higher education|home-leaving|incarceration|race/ethnicity|transition to adulthood|young adulthood,2019-06-11T12:43:41.853049,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7c83/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7c83/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7c83/citation/,h7c83,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7c83/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7c83/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/d3xku/,d3xku,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7c83/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cfe3eba3cd70c00170132fb/,5cfe3eba3cd70c00170132fb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7c83/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7c83/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/h7c83/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/h7c83/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/h7c83,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Produced annually since 1990 in conjunction with the US Census Bureau, the IRS migration data represent 95 to 98 percent of the tax-filing universe and their dependents, making the IRS migration data one of the largest sources of migration data. However, any analysis using the IRS migration data must process at least seven legacy formats of these public data across more than 2000 data files -- a serious burden for migration scholars. 

OBJECTIVE: To produce a single, flat data file containing complete county-to-county IRS migration flow data and to make the computer code to process the migration data freely available. 

METHODS: This paper uses R to process more than 2,000 IRS migration files into a single, flat data file for use in migration research. 

CONTRIBUTION: To encourage and facilitate the use of this data, we provide a single, standardized, flat data file containing county-to-county 1-year migration flows for the period 1990-2010 (containing 163,883 dyadic county pairs resulting in 3.2 million county pair-year observations totaling over 343 million migrants) and provide the full R script to download, process, and flatten the IRS migration data.",TRUE,FALSE,data|demography|IRS|migration|R,2019-03-07T16:53:41.983582,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-07,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/citation/,zmp4t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/wgcf3/,wgcf3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c81253202da7700198f70d3/,5c81253202da7700198f70d3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zmp4t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zmp4t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zmp4t,https://doi.org/10.4054/DemRes.2019.40.40,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study extended the understanding of bicycle mode choice and the influence of built form through an analysis of dwelling type, density, and mode choice. Apartment dwelling and active transportation are related to intensification, but an understanding of the impact of increased density on bicycling is muddied by the lack of isolation of cycling from walking in many studies and by the lack of controls for the confounding effects of dwelling type. This study examined the relationship between dwelling type and mode choice in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. In this study of 223,232 trips, 25 variables were controlled for, and multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to estimate relative risk ratios. Strong evidence was found that a trip that originated from an apartment-based household was less than half as likely to be taken by bicycle as a similar trip that originated from a house-based household in Toronto in 2011. Increased population density of the household location had a positive impact on the likelihood that a trip would be taken by walking and a negligible and uncertain impact on the likelihood that it would be taken by transit. However, increased population density had a negative impact on bicycling. Further analysis found that the negative impact of density did not seem to apply to those who lived in single detached housing but rather only to the likelihood that apartment and townhouse dwellers would cycle. Further research is required to identify the exact barriers to cycling that apartment dwellers experience.",TRUE,FALSE,apartments|bicycle|density|mode choice|Toronto,2019-07-24T11:03:46.304196,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,Trudy Ledsham|Steven Farber|&amp; Nate Wessel,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/citation/,nvg64,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d371272251f0e001809ac7a/,5d371272251f0e001809ac7a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/nvg64/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/nvg64/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/nvg64,https://doi.org/10.3141/2662-08,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I investigate the racial and ethnic compositions of stably integrated communities as well as the characteristics that distinguish these places. Using the information theory index (H) among stably diverse places, I identify cities and suburbs that were racially integrated between 2000 and 2010. Integrated places cluster in highly diverse, coastal metropolitan areas and almost entirely within suburbs. Moreover, integration is firmly patterned along racial lines. Reflecting the antiblack nature of segregation in the US, the rate of black-white integration remains remarkably low (10.5%), but in multiethnic communities with Asians and Latinxs, the probability of black-white integration nearly quadruples (40.1%). Several critical features of place are positively associated with integration: military and public sector employment as well as public university enrollment; new housing stock; and metropolitan political fragmentation.

Drawing on insights from the history and sociology of science, I argue that the social sciences rely on knowledge infrastructures to monitor trends and identify stylized facts. These infrastructures collect, process, and distribute data in ways that channel sustained attention to particular problems while rendering other potential observations out of focus. Knowledge infrastructures, like other infrastructures, have significant inertia: initial design choices that followed from particular theoretical, political, and practical priorities become locked in and shape the kinds of data readily available to future researchers. Using this framework, I show how the dominant economic knowledge infrastructures constructed in the mid-20th century were incapable of tracking top incomes, creating the conditions under which experts, policymakers, and the public alike could be surprised by the rediscovery of the 1%.",TRUE,FALSE,economics|inequality|knowledge infrastructures|stylized facts|top incomes,2019-06-11T12:51:29.940959,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-11,FALSE,NA,no,Coded articles available on request.,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",Daniel Hirschman,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea2hy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea2hy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea2hy/citation/,ea2hy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea2hy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea2hy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea2hy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cff1f80edaf28001a9d18f3/,5cff1f80edaf28001a9d18f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea2hy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea2hy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ea2hy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ea2hy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ea2hy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
npkdy,preprints,2019-09-09,2020-07-11,2019-09-09,NA,NA,"Small gods, rituals, and cooperation: The Mentawai water spirit Sikameinan","Cognitive and evolutionary research has overwhelmingly focused on the powerful deities of large-scale societies, yet little work has examined the smaller gods of animist traditions. Here, in a study of the Mentawai water spirit Sikameinan (Siberut Island, Indonesia), we address three questions: (1) Are smaller gods believed to enforce cooperation, especially compared to bigger gods in larger-scale societies? (2) Do beliefs in these deities encourage people to engage in behavior that would otherwise be perceived as costly? and (3) Does ritual reinforce beliefs in these deities? Drawing on interview responses, data from healing ceremonies, and ethnographic observation, we show that Sikameinan is believed to punish people who violate meat-sharing norms and that people ‘attacked’ by Sikameinan pay shamans to conduct healing rituals.

The most widely shared beliefs about Sikameinan are represented in rituals while beliefs not represented vary considerably, indicating that ritual may be potent for cultural transmission.

It employs Google Docs as an educational tool to engage Saudi EFL students in online peer review to address some challenges faced instructors when they implement peer review in class. The main goals of the study are examining what kinds of corrective feedback that Saudi EFL students provide when they edit their peers’ texts in Google Docs, how they can improve their texts based on the collaborative online peer review, and what their attitudes are toward using Google Docs as an online peer review tool.  The study utilizes Google Docs, an online questionnaire, and an interview as research tools; after thematic analysis, the results show that Saudi EFL students focus on local and global writing issues and provide different types of corrective feedback that aid them to improve their writing. They have positive attitudes toward using Google Docs in peer review. This tool allows them to engage in an online social environment outside the classroom, feel as critical editors, adjust their writing, and avoid embarrassment. The results also suggest that hierarchical power in the classroom and students’ prior beliefs and experiences can impact their responses to the given feedback from teachers and peers.

Digital involvement may be particularly valuable in exploring methods to plan at a megaregional scale. Research is beginning to address digital inequalities, recognizing that broadband and smartphone access may restrict opportunities for disadvantaged groups. However, the geography and equity of participation remain pragmatic issues for practice and research. This paper reviews the geography and equity of the participation methods in Austin, Texas for active transportation (bicycling and pedestrian) through three approaches to co-produce informed plans: in-person meetings, public participation geographic information system (PPGIS), and an emerging smartphone platform that logs trips and encourages input on route quality. In addition to spatial analysis with standard deviational ellipses, we include qualitative case analysis to contextualize the geographic and equity implications of different participation approaches. Results show that both online techniques resulted in a larger geography for participation than in-person meetings, with the regional PPGIS covering the most area. However, review of the income levels in each area shows that use of the smartphone-based crowdsourcing platform was aligned with lowest-income areas. This study shows that online participation methods are not homogeneous regarding geography or equity. In some contexts, smartphone applications can help reach lower-income communities, even when compared with in-person meetings. Crowdsourcing tools can be valuable approaches to increase geography and equity of public participation in transportation planning.",TRUE,FALSE,bicycling|crowdsourcing|equity|GIS|megaregion|public participation,2019-01-12T15:10:26.982152,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/citation/,9ghrn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c398bf48047080018fceb7a/,5c398bf48047080018fceb7a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9ghrn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9ghrn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9ghrn,https://doi.org/10.1177/0361198118823498,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This resulted in many national mandates and international guidelines on OA publishing of scientific results. One of the reasons OA has been pushed so strongly by science policy is found in the argument that what is financed publicly, should be publicly available. This argument, also known as the ‘tax payers argument’ is used to support and legitimize the push for open accessibility, not only of scientific publications, but also of the underlying research data, in order to guarantee the nonacademic sector, with lower degrees of accessibility to otherwise ‘behind-the-paywall’ information, access to outcomes of scientific research in the public sector. In this study we will focus on the developments in the OA publishing in one particular institutional sector, the private sector. Business enterprises represent the main sector in terms of R&amp;D investments. According to Eurostat, in the year 2016 this sector represented 65% of the total R&amp;D expenditures within the EU28. While objectives and incentives in the private sector might not always been aligned with the disclosure of research results in the open scientific literature, there is no doubt that this is the main actor when it comes to R&amp;D performance. Within the business sector, we will focus our study in the pharmaceutical sector, by selecting a number of large pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies represent an interesting case of study, given that is it one of the most R&amp;D intensive industries, while it si also known for its shift in R&amp;D orientation, from an in-house focus in the development of R&amp;D towards a model much more open and collaborative, with more interactions with academic partners and other companies. Despite the importance of industrial R&amp;D, until now it remains relatively understudied how private sector institutions which are active in R&amp;D have embraced the OA movement, hence it remains relatively unknown how the private sector adapts to and can benefit from the new paradigm of open scholarship. Our objective is to shed more light on the extent to which big pharma both has been publishing in OA and also has been benefiting from OA publications to build their own research.",TRUE,FALSE,Big Pharma|OA data usage|OA publishing|Public-private cooperation,2019-02-07T20:17:27.915125,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-07,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/citation/,zt6kc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5b053376653c001a26750e/,5c5b053376653c001a26750e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zt6kc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zt6kc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zt6kc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The results, obtained via propensity score matching and linear regression, show that coresidence with and parental support for adult children is negatively associated with non-home assets and positively associated with debt levels among Canadian households. Further analyses suggest that these relationships stem from differences in financial assets, retirement savings, student loan debt, and credit card balances.

Additionally, it also attempts to explore and shed some light on the relationship between the two domains: pragmatics and literature in order to reveal their commonalities.

However, to best of my knowledge a little has been done in this regard to keep the students in line with the most recent advancements in this paradigm in Saudi Arabia. This paper evaluates the efficacy of CALL in improving students’ writing skills and provides innovative techniques and robust strategies for long-lasting learning. The research seeks to fill in the knowledge gap regarding prospects of using CALL in the Kingdom with these main research questions; 1) how is the technology presently used for teaching the writing skills?; 2) what is the true impact of using CALL on students’ writing skills?; 3) which area of the language (organization, structure, content, grammar) sees the most improvements by CALL to make them better writers? A quantitative research design was used for this study. The sample was sixty female students of a Saudi University divided equally into control and experimental groups. The elicited data analysis indicates that the performance scores of two groups differ significantly when taught through CALL. The research contends that using CALL can enhance students’ writing skills over a short period of time when compared to the traditional ways of improving the writing skills.

The Yakuza Exclusion Ordinances (YEOs) of Japan aim to combat organized crime syndicates—the yakuza—and to increase social welfare. Consistent with the principles of TPP, the YEOs prohibit third parties—non-yakuza individuals—from providing any benefit to the yakuza. We study both intended and unintended consequences of the YEOs by examining the YEOs’ effects on the number of yakuza members and on the revenues generated by communications fraud, which is the yakuza’s emergent income source.                                                       Methods: We use unique data on the yakuza and communications fraud. Using prefecture-level variation in the YEOs’ enactment dates, we apply a difference-indifferences approach, while allowing for heterogeneity in the YEOs’ effects by regional concentration levels of yakuza syndicates.
Results: The YEOs decrease the number of yakuza members but increases the revenues generated by communications fraud. Moreover, the YEOs’ effects are smaller in regions with higher concentration levels of yakuza syndicates. These results are consistent with the argument that former yakuza members, who generally experience poor economic conditions and criminogenic conditions, tend to engage in widespread communications fraud.                                 Conclusions: The YEOs are related to TPP strategies that rely on coercive techniques. Given this, our results support the effectiveness of TPP against organized crime but suggest that TPP can have unintended consequences on organized crime by increasing the level of income-generating crime.

Nearly three decades ago, the Austrian government deployed special accommodations to handle a similarly sized influx of refugees entering Europe, individuals and families who were fleeing ethnic cleansing from the Bosnian War. These accommodations, and their eventual economic integration components, provide longitudinal data that indicates a system that allowed employment rates of Bosnian refugees to match the rate of host country populations within a generation. 
Through thematic analysis of an extensive literature review and field consultations in Vienna, this research will investigate what lessons the global community can learn from Austria’s treatment of Bosnians refugees, and whether these lessons can contribute to improved procedures for integrating refugees into host societies. Preliminary results indicate the role of social capital, civil society, and religion as factors of labor market integration, while also acknowledging rates of underemployment and stagnation in the asylum process as deterrents to positive relationship formation between host societies and refugee populations.

Social media adoption and de-adoption are related to the extent of students’ bonding integration (social connections and social support) and competitive integration (related to status and dominance hierarchies) into the social life of the school, where more integrated students are more likely to adopt more social media platforms.

To probe the generality of the experimental finding, we combine a representative geo-referenced survey with neighborhood-level census-derived measures of local inequality, a proxy for direct encounters with tangible reminders of economic inequality.

We use both text mining and qualitative analysis methods to ask three research questions about GoFundMe campaigns from the United States created in 2018 and 2019. First, how do campaigners on GoFundMe describe their need for personal vehicles? Second, what precipitating events led them to seek crowdfunding for a car purchase or repair? Third, what are broader contexts for these requests for financial assistance?
We find that many campaigns describe several interrelated crises, complications, or challenges that the campaigners faced, such as medical conditions, loss of employment, and housing crises. Most campaigners are without a functioning car because of an unexpected event—a car crash, a breakdown, or repairs piling up—combined with their inability to pay for the repairs or replacement.

We provide an extensive assessment of issue accountability at the individual level. We trace the congressional rollcall votes on 44 bills across seven Congresses (2006-2018), and link them to constituent's perceptions of their representative's votes and their evaluation of their representative.  Correlational, instrumental variables, and experimental approaches all show that constituents hold representatives accountable. A one-standard deviation increase in a constituent's perceived issue agreement with their representative can improve net approval by 35 percentage points.

We test between these alternatives with experiments that offer incentives for correct survey responses and allow respondents to search for information before answering each question.

Incentives have no impact on partisan divides in information search; these divides are no different from those that occur outside the survey context when we examine web browsing data from the same respondents.

Initially the focus of this centred on the proliferation of online groups and websites promoting and distributing discriminatory content. Since the introduction of more interactive tools and platforms in the mid-2000s that enabled new and faster ways of disseminating content in a relatively anonymous fashion, concerns about online hate speech becoming a pervasive behavior have increased.

Current research and analysis acknowledge the complex nature of online hate, the mediating role of technology and the influence of other contextual factors (e.g. social or political events). However, despite the growing attention on the topic, New Zealand-based research looking at personal experiences and/or exposure to online hate is surprisingly absent. This study seeks to address this gap. It builds on existing international research on young people’s experiences to explore those of the adult New Zealand population based on a nationally representative sample.

From the language classroom comes further the wider social context of university in which EFL students learn outside the formal learning environment in relation to the opportunities to use and to be exposed to the target language. Two data collection methods are employed: questionnaires and interviews. It is revealed that the students perceive that the wider social context indeed influences their learning experiences outside as well as in the language classroom in two major aspects: self-development in English use and drawing on English as a common means of communication or a lingua franca (ELF) whereby there is an implicit search for similarities through English. Many further report that the specific university culture and its environment play a great role in their English learning, motivating or demotivating them to use English for communication. Implications from the study can be made to Thai EFL universities to focus on the stance on English and their efforts to make the school environment more conducive to English use and learning.",TRUE,FALSE,English as a foreign language (EFL) English as a lingua franca (ELF)|school Culture|social context|university learners,2019-07-21T21:16:22.608866,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/citation/,53dvt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2bce931c5b4a001aa462bd/,5d2bce931c5b4a001aa462bd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/53dvt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/53dvt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/53dvt,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no2.3,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This paper uses qualitative interviews to understand the process by which graduates of elite colleges decide where to live following graduation. It shows that many graduates are indifferent about exactly where they live, and find themselves funneled towards certain cities based on geographically uneven access to two key types of information. Facilitative information eases the job search process, enabling graduates to find and obtain opportunities they want, while formative information helps them determine what they want in the first place.  Graduates’ position in social structure—in particular their past experiences and personal networks—affects their exposure to both types of information in ways that strongly influence where they end up and on occasion even overcome their stated location preferences. This geographically uneven access to information supplies one mechanism leading to the spatial concentration of human capital.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-03-16T19:16:29.682034,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/citation/,f6rnk,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8d28ce075b640019a3d3c1/,5c8d28ce075b640019a3d3c1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f6rnk/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f6rnk/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f6rnk,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A review of South Australian school uniform policy following mandated requirement for choice.,"Background: School uniform options such as skirts and dresses can impact physical activity and psychological wellbeing of girls. Restrictions that exclude trousers/pants or shorts as uniform options for girls can promote inequality in comfort and engagement in school activities. The South Australian Department of Education and Child Development (DECD) School Dress Code Procedure mandates school dress codes provide flexible uniform options with the right to choice, regardless of gender. This review examines public school adherence to DECD guidelines, and compares girls’ uniform options between public and private school sectors.

Method: The proportion of girls shorts and pants/trouser options provided in school uniform policies collated in 2018 were compared across 486 public and 193 private primary, secondary, and combined schools within South Australia. Policies were grouped based on the choice they provided girls for shorts, and separately for trousers/pants. The groups were gender specific choice/open choice, unisex choice, restricted choice, or no option.

Results: Overall, 98.6% of public and 26.4% of private school policies included shorts as a uniform option for girls. Of these schools, about nine in ten public, and just over half private, policies listed gender-specific or open choice shorts options. All public primary and high schools, and a majority of combined schools (98.8%) provided girls pants/trouser options, with 93.4% providing gender specific or open choices. This compared to 34.2% of private school policies including girls’ pants options. In total less than 1.0% of public, and 45.5% to 66.7% of private schools provide no opportunity for girls to wear shorts every day. Similarly, 56.0% of private schools do not provide any trouser/pant option.

Conclusion: The results highlight a small proportion of public schools fail to follow mandated uniform policy procedures set by the DECD, specifically in context of shorts. Moreover, this report clearly demonstrates the discrepancy in girls’ uniform options between the public and private school sectors. We present suggestions and recommendations with the aim to improve current policy, as well as a need to advance adherence to policy and South Australian anti-discrimination legislation in public and particularly private schools.",TRUE,FALSE,anti-discrimination|gender equity|girls uniform|school uniform|uniform|uniform choice,2019-08-07T12:58:22.330514,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-07,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6a|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6b|Education|Disability and Equity in Education|Gender Equity in Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/citation/,kvwge,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4abb72272b140019eabaf1/,5d4abb72272b140019eabaf1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kvwge/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kvwge/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kvwge,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The securitization of cross-border mobility has been a common theme in examining immigration policies in the Global North. The securitization of emigration and diasporas in non-democratic contexts remains neglected; this is particularly true with regard to Arab states’ extraterritorial authoritarian practices. This article argues that authoritarian states develop a range of migration policies that are driven by the contradictory pressures of economic and political imperatives or, put differently, an illiberal paradox: if a state does not expect economic gains from cross-border mobility, it is more likely to securitize its emigration policy; otherwise, it is more likely to securitize its diaspora policy.

We take up the three empirical dimensions of self-determination that Ryan and Deci have distinguished in their motivational theory of psychological self-determination and transpose them to the collective level. On the dimension of autonomy, collective self-determination refers to the institutions and rules of a democratic communication order; on the competence dimension, it refers to citizens’ political efficacy beliefs; and on the dimension of social connectedness, collective self-determination denotes the existence of shared communicative spaces even across deep divides. This conception of self-determination allows us, on the one hand, to identify causal influences between the individual and collective levels and, on the other hand, helps bring into focus the problems of realizing self-determination in societal communication as well as potentials for their solution.

The problem formulation of this study is how the principle of composing listening materials that contain the value of local wisdom based on the dimensions of roles and parts. The findings of this study can be used as a reference in making learning models, especially listening materials which can be used as a means to foster students’ characters related to their culture and appreciation toward local wisdom. The research design used in this study is research and development (R &amp; D) design. This research produces roles with local wisdom to be an emotionally better person for a harmonious life, especially when the students are engaged in group discussion activities. To teach local wisdom related to environment care can be done through learning activities. It can be seen how the students are actively participating in the listening activities. Then, cognitive domain can be carried out in the learning process in the form of memorizing or remembering.

The purpose of the book is threefold: (i) to present a historical and theoretical analysis of social protection systems and welfare regimes in contemporary Latin America; (ii) to discuss the politics of contemporary social protection and how national/global actors and institutions shape social policy in the region; and (iii) to examine several debates on social protection and welfare systems in contemporary Latin America. The chapter presents state-of-the-art research in the areas of social policy and welfare that is examined in each of the three parts of the book. What do we know about welfare regimes in Latin America? What do we know about the role of (f)actors shaping social protection development and inclusion? What do we know about recent debates regarding social protection and welfare in Latin America? Particular attention is paid to the contribution made by chapters in this edited volume to the social policy literature.

Two decades after South Africa launched a world-leading legal framework for LGBTI protections, I argue that these media representations depict the growing inclusion of black LGBTIQ people as a process of bridging the supposed “gap” between homosexuality and African culture. This new “bridging the gap” script seemingly rejects the older, dominant script portraying homosexuality as intrinsically “un-African.” But I argue that it instead reproduces the “un-African” script in a new, liberal guise, offering inclusion to black LGBTIQ South Africans on limited terms that continue to obscure their embeddedness within African histories and communities.",TRUE,FALSE,African culture|African marriage|homosexuality|intersectionality|LGBT identities|media|same-sex marriage|South Africa|tradition,2019-05-12T15:51:46.884196,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-12,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c99|Arts and Humanities|African Languages and Societies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d02|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d03|Arts and Humanities|Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies|Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Studies|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d22|Arts and Humanities|Film and Media Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d92|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|African Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e23|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Human Rights|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/citation/,hcq9y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/8duwz/,8duwz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd799ee840cae001a6f9f5b/,5cd799ee840cae001a6f9f5b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/hcq9y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/hcq9y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/hcq9y,https://doi.org/10.2979/africatoday.67.1.04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

But how exactly are such evaluative judgments formed? What are the underlying psychological processes of media entertainment evaluations? And why do we sometimes feel that the heart and mind are in conflict about those evaluations? To cover the whole complexity of individual media entertainment ratings, we apply the associative–propositional evaluation (APE) model (Gawronski &amp; Bodenhausen, 2006a, 2011) to the case of movie evaluation processes before, during and after exposure. After defining evaluation and introducing the APE model, we discuss its theoretical and methodological implications for movies and entertainment research.

While the average age and educational attainment of workers in these occupations has increased significantly since the 1970s, many of these occupations offer low wages, along with limited fringe benefits and opportunities for advancement. These occupations also employ a disproportionate share of Black and Hispanic women. Using longitudinal data from the 2004 and 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation which provide occupational data over a four year timespan, we evaluate the prevalence of occupational mobility by sex, race, and ethnicity. This research shows there are racial disparities in occupational mobility, with Black and Hispanic women less likely to exit retail and service occupations than White, non-Hispanic women. Educational attainment increased the likelihood of occupational mobility. Hispanic women’s lower levels of educational attainment depressed their occupational mobility, while longer job tenure increased the likelihood they would be occupationally mobile. Differences in human capital and job tenure did not explain mobility disparities between Black and White, non-Hispanic women. However, unionization reduced occupational mobility and partly accounts for Black women’s lower rates of mobility. Black women were more likely to be unionized and unionization was associated with decreased occupational mobility among women. Workers in unionized retail and service occupations earned higher wages, reducing the incentive to leave and lowering their occupational mobility rate.",TRUE,FALSE,occupational mobility|race and ethnicity|retail|service|women's employment,2019-07-24T13:11:04.709808,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-24,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Labor Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/citation/,ykufd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kj8dx/,kj8dx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3761725d2cdc0019078056/,5d3761725d2cdc0019078056,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ykufd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ykufd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ykufd,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The introduction of information and communication technologies in educational and research processes is a compulsory requirement to implement the concept of modernization in Russian education. Recently, interest in English as a means of international communication has increased significantly, it has already been recognized as the language of professional communication in various fields of activity. The relevance of this work is undoubted. Modern higher school teachers are constantly looking for more effective approaches in training English and in the process of creating an electronic educational environment that would allow students access to various sources of information and help satisfy the interests of the modern student. The goal of the research is to increase the efficiency of training English in the system of higher professional education through the development and use of educational software products that apply modern information technology. Methods to achieve this goal include the method of using computer technology, methods of network planning and project management. The research showed that the organization of the information-instrumental educational environment uses a student centered approach, the development of an electronic educational and methodological complex (EEMC) is a search for an algorithm, most adapted to the student's cognitive needs, and EEMC in English creates the best conditions for the principle of interactivity.

The food and feeding habits including types and amount of feed and seasonal pattern of feeding were studied. 168 Aspidoparia morar were collected from the River Padma, Rajshahi, Bangladesh from May to December, 2011. The relationship between total length and alimentary canal length was tested using OLS regression. Qualitative as well as quantitative analyses of stomach and gut contents of each fish were done by percentage of occurrence and point method and fullness of stomach was measured by fullness index method. Aspidoparia morar was omnivorous due to the presence of both phytoplankton (Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Cyanophyceae) and zooplankton (Rotifera, Crustacea) in the gut content. Based on the point method, the average percentage of phytoplankton and zooplankton was 80.71% and 19.29%, respectively. The highest average percentage of fullness was 72.62% in October whereas the lowest was 56.55% in December. The highest average percentage of emptiness recorded was 43.45% in December and the lowest was 27.38% in October. Total length was found statistically positively significant (P0.01) with the alimentary canal length. Overall, the article concludes that Aspidoparia morar is an omnivore with a higher feeding preference for phytoplankton and the food habits change with the seasons based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of food.",TRUE,FALSE,emptiness of stomach|feeding intensity|Food and feeding habit|fullness of stomach|plankton,2019-02-28T16:49:23.710715,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Studies,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/citation/,kybg9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/nqshr/,nqshr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7754b782a3950018ce8fbf/,5c7754b782a3950018ce8fbf,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kybg9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kybg9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kybg9,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Besondere Prominenz in dieser Debatte hat dabei die Hypothese sogenannter „Echokammern“ gewonnen, wonach digitale Medien ihre Nutzer darin bestärken, insbesondere solche Nachrichten zu beziehen, deren politische Positionierung sie teilen, und dadurch zu einer gesellschaftlichen Polarisierung beitragen. Während Echokammern in der öffentlichen Debatte zumeist unkritisch als gegeben betrachtet werden, wird das Konzept im wissenschaftlichen Diskurs zunehmend hinterfragt. Als Herausforderungen erweisen sich dabei eine schwache theoretische Aufarbeitung des Phänomens, ein stark zersplittertes Forschungsfeld und eine mangelnde Generalisierbarkeit von Forschungsergebnissen aufgrund des primären Fokus auf den US-amerikanischen Kontext. Der vorliegende Beitrag begegnet diesen Problemstellungen und gibt einen detaillierten Überblick über das Forschungsfeld. Der Literaturüberblick trägt dabei zur theoretischen Erfassung des Untersuchungsgegenstands bei, insbesondere durch eine explizite Differenzierung zwischen Fragmentierung und Polarisierung, und berücksichtigt außerdem länderspezifische Variationen. Insgesamt kommt dieser Überblick zu dem Schluss, dass die im öffentlichen Diskurs geäußerte Furcht vor einer gesamtgesellschaftlichen Fragmentierung durch digitale Medien und einer damit verbundenen politischen Polarisierung empirisch nicht unterstützt wird. So ist aufbauend auf die bisherige Forschung keine Fragmentierung öffentlicher Aufmerksamkeit entlang politischer Präferenzen feststellbar. Auch auf der Wirkungsebene der Polarisierung sprechen die bisherigen Erkenntnisse gegen die vereinfachten Annahmen der Echokammer-Hypothese. Dennoch sind die bisherigen wissenschaftlichen Befunde aufgrund von Limitationen im Datenzugang noch nicht umfassend genug. Der Beitrag verdeutlicht, dass die politische Kommunikationsforschung insbesondere von innovativen, extern validen Designs und komparativer Forschung außerhalb des US-Kontexts profitieren würde.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-09-06T15:32:02.628550,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-06,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu2mt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu2mt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu2mt/citation/,bu2mt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu2mt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu2mt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu2mt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6fadfe6f41fc0019319565/,5d6fadfe6f41fc0019319565,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu2mt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu2mt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bu2mt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bu2mt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bu2mt,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12286-019-00429-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

To reduce emissions, policies aim to enhance material efficiency and the circular economy, but our understanding of the dynamics of material-related greenhouse gas emissions is limited. Here, I quantify the greenhouse gas emissions from material production and the carbon footprint of materials in industries that are the first users of materials, and in final consumption, using a multiregional input–output model of the global economy and the hypothetical extraction method. From 1995 to 2015, greenhouse gas emissions from just material production increased by 120%, with 11 billion tons of CO2-equivalent emitted in 2015. As a proportion of global emissions, material production rose from 15 to 23%. China accounted for 75% of the growth. In terms of the first use of materials, two-fifths of the carbon footprint of materials is attributed to construction, and two-fifths to the manufacturing of machinery, vehicles and other durable products. Overall, the replacement of existing or formation of new capital stocks now accounts for 60% of material-related emissions.

pr5ec,preprints,2019-03-17,2020-07-16,2019-03-17,NA,NA,Men and women differ in their perception of gender bias in research institutions,"There is extensive evidence of gender inequality in research, leading to insufficient representation of women in leadership positions. Numbers revealing a gender gap in research are periodically reported by national and international institutions but data on perceptions of gender equality within the research community are scarce. In the present study, a questionnaire based on the British Athena Survey of Science, Engineering and Technology (ASSET 2016) was distributed among researchers working in Spain. Consistent with the original UK-based study, women in research perceived a greater degree of gender inequality than men. This difference was consistent from junior to senior positions, within public and private universities as well as research centres, and across all research disciplines. When responses were compared with the existing UK-based questionnaire, researchers in Spain felt that women and men are treated more equally in the workplace, yet they perceived their home departments to be less supportive regarding matters of gender equality. The results of this study provide clear evidence that men and women do not share the same perceptions of gender equality in science and that their differing perceptions are relatively consistent across two major European countries. The fact that men occupy the majority of senior positions while not perceiving the same inequality as women do, may be critical when it comes to ensuring the fair ascent of women to senior positions in an academic system.

This study describes the development and validation the Menstrual Practice Needs Scale (MPNS-36) which measures the extent to which females’ menstrual practices and environments meet their needs. 
Methods. A 54-item pool was developed following systematic-review of qualitative and quantitative studies and expert feedback. Item reduction and scale validation were undertaken using a cross-sectional survey of 538 menstruating schoolgirls in Soroti, Uganda. Test-retest reliability was assessed in a sub-sample of 52 girls two weeks after the first administration. Construct validity was tested through relationships with hypothesised correlates: confidence to manage menses, self-reported school absenteeism, and mental health symptoms. 
Results. The final MPNS-36 comprises 28 items applicable to all respondents, and 8 items capturing washing and drying experiences for those reusing menstrual materials. A four-factor solution for the core 28 items was the best fit for the data (RMSEA=0.028-0.029; CFI=0.961-0.964; TFI=0.957-0.959), supplemented by two factors for reuse (RMSEA=0.021-0.030; CFI=0.987-0.994; TFI=0.981-0.991). Subscale and total scores were calculated as mean scores to support accessibility for practitioners. Subscales were ‘material and home environment needs’ (11 items, α-ordinal=0.84), ‘transport and school environment needs’ (5-items, α-ordinal=0.73), ‘material reliability concerns’ (3-items, α-ordinal=0.55), ‘change and disposal insecurity’ (9-items, α-ordinal=0.80), ‘reuse needs’ (5-items, α-ordinal=0.76), and ‘reuse insecurity’ (3-items, α-ordinal=0.56). Relationships between subscales and hypothesised correlates supported validity. Home- and school-based items were more strongly associated with confidence to manage menstruation at home and school, respectively. Higher scores predicted not missing school during the last menstrual period (total score: OR=2.62, 95%CI=1.52-4.50). Test-retest reliability was moderate (total score: ICC(2,1)=0.69).
Conclusions. The MPNS-36 demonstrated acceptable reliability and validity. It is the first measure to capture women and girls perceived menstrual hygiene and may be used across a range of study designs to assess menstrual needs. Future research should explore the suitability and sensitivity of the measure across contexts.",TRUE,FALSE,menstrual health|menstrual hygiene|outcome assessment|psychometrics,2019-09-20T09:10:43.418954,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/citation/,djh4x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/qshkc/,qshkc,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d83bdc0b3103d00164f543e/,5d83bdc0b3103d00164f543e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/djh4x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/djh4x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/djh4x,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I ask two questions: 1) how do people who live in regions of consistent economic decline interpret the meanings of absent transportation? And thus, 2) what does transportation maintenance look like in those regions? This line of inquiry emerged unexpectedly from a broader interview project. Between 2015 and 2017, I conducted 90 interviews in two communities at opposite ends of a former, Midwestern steel commodity chain. In both a rural, iron mining community and an urban steel manufacturing neighborhood, transportation infrastructure emerged unbidden and central in interviewees’ descriptions of boom and bust. The late 19th and early 20th century construction of industrial transportation—rail, shipping, and roadways—was recalled by interviewees as facilitating both economic growth and cultural connection required for the social thriving of these communities. The closure of the anchor companies in these communities, then, was the climax in interviewees’ narratives, and the decline (both intentional and natural) of industrial transportation infrastructure appeared again and again as a visible, experienced, and emotional metaphor of the gradual disconnection and loss they experienced. References to declines in industrial transportation often segued to frustrations about the uneven distribution of public transportation (bus and passenger train) or highways. Declines in industrial employment and infrastructures propelled massive depopulation in my case study regions; depopulation, in turn, caused disinvestment in public transportation. This paper expands on the transportation track themes of marginalization of certain segments of the population, with a particular focus on the lived experiences of deindustrialization.",TRUE,FALSE,embodiment|infrastructure|metaphor|rust belt|transportation,2019-09-20T20:38:21.922019,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/citation/,3mhca,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d84cc8f305a6800170ba768/,5d84cc8f305a6800170ba768,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3mhca/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3mhca/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3mhca,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this paper, we evaluate a two-year field experiment in an apparel factory to analyze altered compensation systems designed to increase worker pay while supporting factory goals around productivity and profitability. Using a quasi-experimental design, with unique data on wages, hours, productivity, quality, and worker engagement, we estimate the impact of three altered compensation systems on pay, productivity, and factory profits. The compensation systems can be described as: 1) an improved productivity-based scheme, 2) a scheme that brings quality and waste reduction into the calculation; and 3) a “target wage” scheme. Overall, the treatments raised wages by 4.2-9.7% and increased productivity by 8-10% points. Management reported significant financial benefits from the experiment, including increased profits for five of six lines, and avoided costs and productivity losses due to decreased turnover. The factory workers, through focus-group interviews before, during, and after the intervention, reported improved relations with team members and managers.

xgrvb,preprints,2019-08-01,2020-08-04,2019-08-02,NA,NA,"The Search for Satisfaction: A Journey Through Drive, Jouissance And Repetition Incorporating Neuroscience","Understanding drives is essential because they tell us about that original encounter in which a somatic stimulus encounters the mental representations. This paper is an attempt to recollect previous research and construct a parallel of psychoanalytic concepts and neuroscientific findings such as the correspondence between drive and libido and the dopaminergic seeking system. We are mind, body and language.
In our research we present the hypothesis that there are three existing paths of obtaining certain level of satisfaction – pleasure, jouissance and death drive, led by the pleasure principle of partial satisfaction and the Nirvana principle of (impossible) complete satisfaction.
In Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Freud reviews his own drive theory incorporating a new term - death drive. Freud theorized about compulsion repetition, a cycle in which a behavior is carried out repeatedly and repressed material is lived instead of remembered, let alone elaborated. He observes that some are not guided by the principle of pleasure seeking, which reveals a complacency of the subject with the suffering of his symptoms, beyond their conscious yearning for healing. While the goal of the life drives is self-preservation, sexual satisfaction, creation and procreation, the final goal of the death drive appears to be to completely reduce tensions and return the living individual to the inorganic state of stillness and repose which is unachievable.
When Jacques Lacan introduces the concept of jouissance (enjoyment), he refers to this mythical state of complete satisfaction before the barrier of the castration as such.
The way to achieve this state of minimum tension, can as well be mediated by addiction and/or compulsive behavior as we have seen before, suppressing the internal tension of stimulus and surrendering to the principle of Nirvana and the death drives – complete reduction of any tension.
Now we know that the frontal cortex is responsible for regulating the instinctual reactions and puts them in social context.

Examples include the valuation of a credit default swap (CDS) contract that is affected by the trilateral credit risk of the buyer, seller and reference entity. We show that default dependency has a significant impact on asset pricing. In fact, correlated default risk is one of the most pervasive threats in financial markets. We also show that a fully collateralized CDS is not equivalent to a risk-free one.

To address this gap, we aim to identify factors that influence bystanders’ risk of being physically victimized. Methods: We observed bystander behavior from video surveillance footage of naturally occurring violence in night-time economy settings, and data was analyzed with a logistic regression model. Results: Data shows that approximately one out of six interventions results in some type of victimization, typically with a relatively low degree of severity. The bystander’s social group membership, the setting of the emergency, and the bystander’s intervention type are estimated as risk factors for victimization. Conclusions: Previous research suggests that a bystander’s social group membership with victims promotes intervention behavior.

On an average, 86.6% of the respondents agreed that they focus on these factors of market orientation. The federal owned GLCs place more emphasis on market orientation than the state owned GLCs. This study suggests improving the practices of market orientation of GLCs in Malaysia by emphasizing on providing close attention to after-sales service, responding rapidly to the threats of competitive actions, regularly discussing the competitors’ strengths and strategies by top management, and freely communicating successful and unsuccessful customer experiences across all business functions.

Moreover, it tests the pedagogy of adopting the strategy of Digital Story Telling (DST) in teaching English as a foreign language. The study is applied on Northern Boarder University as a case study. The first question raised in this study is whether the conventional methods of teaching are the reason behind their failure of speaking the English language and whether the modification in the pedagogy of teaching affects the learners' speaking skill. To this end, data are collected through a questionnaire.  Furthermore, a model of a teaching program, based on using DST strategy, is improved and tested with a group of learners at the chosen university in Saudi Arabia. The findings reveal that the learners at the selected university find difficulty in speaking English, and that applying DST as a pedagogy help the students to develop their overall speaking skill. These findings assist EFL teachers in Saudi Arabia in creating a conducive atmosphere in and out their classes, which will motivate the learners a lot to speak English fluently.

study focuses on the relationships of educators’ general and ICT-related pedagogical beliefs, and the 
foundations of educators’ positive ICT pedagogical beliefs.   
In their general pedagogical beliefs, the educators emphasized the learning of socio-emotional skills, 
and reported that they carry out practices where children have an active role in their learning. In their 
ICT pedagogical beliefs, the educators emphasized the learning of academic skills, and the methods 
they described were usually individual exercises which were either carried out using ICT or by 
following educators’ ICT-supported instructions. Positive ICT pedagogical beliefs were, to a large 
extent, based on perceptions of what different devices and software promise in terms of children’s

The prehistory focuses on Heller’s dementia Infantilis and Bleuler’s autism and schizophrenia. The more formal history begins with Tramer (1924), and continues with Ssucharewa (1926), which still contains some of the best descriptions of autism, although she called the condition schizoid psychopaths or schizoid personality disorders. There is still debate about when and whether Asperger and Kanner read Ssucharewa (1926), but the paper was republished in German in 1932 and quoted by Kanner, post his 1943 paper. The point is that Ssucharewa publication has precedents. George Frankl, the predecessor of Hans Asperger by many years, in the Heilpadogik Clinic was therefore a key figure in the description of autism in Vienna and later he went to America and worked under Leo Kanner, whom he described autism to.",TRUE,FALSE,Asperger syndrome|autism|history|origins,2019-02-18T17:23:47.815983,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dab|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6xg9/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6xg9/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6xg9/citation/,k6xg9,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6xg9/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6xg9/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/q3ywn/,q3ywn,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6xg9/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6a617316506900170faf44/,5c6a617316506900170faf44,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6xg9/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6xg9/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k6xg9/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k6xg9/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k6xg9,https://doi.org/10.26407/2018jrtdd.1.13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While email continues to dominate much workplace interaction, the use of instant messaging (IM) continues to grow (Garrett &amp; Danziger, 2007), prompting scholars to look at how it is used in a variety of organizational contexts. In this chapter, I first give a background on the research into IM use in organizations.

Individuals’ increasing income, flourishing consumer culture, and security in social life as a cumulative force smooths the scope of modern global amenities to come in and grow up amid this changing society. Of them, new age digital communication is vital one. Digital media is encompassing people’s everyday life. Process of acquiring information has also changed remarkably: instead of searching to get one, people now struggle to look for reliable information due to ample information. Cyberspace becomes the cornucopia of fluid information that often baffles the surfers by providing distorted information. Bangladesh has been experiencing digital media-initiated disinformation from the beginning of 2010s. Interest groups are playing with digital disinformation conjoining religious sentiment. As a result, incidents of assault on religious minorities based on digital (dis)information have become frequent. Considering the importance of digital disinformation instigating communalism in Bangladesh, this study explores the nature of contemporary digital communalism and violence on religious minorities.

Estimate whether police legitimacy predicts willingness to cooperate in weak-norm neighborhoods, but not in strong-norm neighborhoods, where most people are willing to cooperate (or not to cooperate) irrespective of their perceptions of police legitimacy. 
 
Methods: A survey of 1,057 individuals in 98 relatively high-crime neighborhoods defined at a small spatial scale measured (a) willingness to cooperate using a hypothetical crime vignette and (b) legitimacy using indicators of normative alignment between police and citizen values. A mixed-effects, location-scale model estimated the cluster-level mean and cluster-level variance of willingness to cooperate as a neighborhood-level latent variable. A cross-level interaction tested whether legitimacy predicts individual-level willingness to cooperate only in neighborhoods where the norm is weak.

Results: Willingness to cooperate clustered strongly by neighborhood. There were neighborhoods with (i) high mean and low variance, (ii) high mean and high variance, (iii) (relatively) low mean and low variance, and (iv) (relatively) low mean and high variance. Legitimacy was only a positive predictor of cooperation in neighborhoods that had a (relatively) low mean and high variance. There was little variance left to explain in neighborhoods where the norm was strong. 

Conclusions: Findings support a boundary condition of procedural justice theory: namely, cooperation can be modelled as a placed-based norm that varies in strength from neighborhood to neighborhood and legitimacy only predicts cooperation in neighborhoods where the norm is relatively weak.",TRUE,FALSE,legitimacy|location-scale|multi-level|neighbourhoods|norms|police|trust,2019-12-04T04:27:02.348708,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-04,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/citation/,jb74u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de62d0ee1e62f000c351f27/,5de62d0ee1e62f000c351f27,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb74u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jb74u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jb74u,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We analyze data from in-depth interviews with 60 adults aged 25-89 from a large southwestern U.S. city to consider how social connections shape smoking behavior across the life course. Respondents provided explanations for how and why they avoided, initiated, continued, and/or quit smoking. At various times, social connections were viewed as having both positive and negative influences on smoking behavior. Both people who never smoked and continuous smokers pointed to the importance of early life social connections in shaping decisions to smoke or not smoke, and viewed later connections (e.g., marriage, coworkers) as less important. People who quit smoking or relapsed tended to attribute their smoking behavior to social connections in adulthood rather than early life. People who changed their smoking behavior highlighted the importance of transitions as related to social connections, with more instability in social connections often discussed by relapsed smokers as a reason for instability in smoking status.

New evidence on age cleavages in Europe since the 1980s,"This paper asks how strong the evidence is for a large and growing age cleavage in European politics, using new estimates of the ideological positions of different age groups in 27 European countries across four issue domains from 1981-2016, together with age-period-cohort analysis and an examination of voting patterns by age. The young turn out to be much more socially liberal than the old in most countries, but also more opposed to taxation and government spending. Age divides are generally no larger now than they were thirty years ago, are explained primarily by cohort replacement effects, and are likely to fall in the near future. Nonetheless, age divides in voting are large and in some places actually increasing. A likely explanation is that, although age-based ideological differences are not new, parties have increasingly emerged and polarised along the dimensions where the young and old have long differed from each other.",TRUE,FALSE,age|Cleavages|European politics|ideology|public opinion,2019-09-04T02:45:02.618354,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8xbg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8xbg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8xbg/citation/,r8xbg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8xbg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8xbg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8xbg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6cd9c5536cf5001786d11b/,5d6cd9c5536cf5001786d11b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8xbg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8xbg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/r8xbg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/r8xbg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/r8xbg,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study examines how social enterprises interact with social finance organizations in the context of impact measurement. Through qualitative research with eight social enterprises and their respective funders, I find evidence that both sides view impact measurement primarily as a means for establishing legitimacy prior to engagement, and in the early stages of their relationship. These relationships are hierarchical and rigid at early stages, but over time evolve into more collaborative partnerships. Eventually, social enterprises embrace impact measurement as a tool for organizational learning, and social finance organizations develop more empowering approaches for impact measurement.

Drawing upon national survey data, we fit logistic regression models and compute standardized logistic regression coefficients to estimate the relative net effects of religious tradition, practices, and beliefs about the Bible on support for same-sex adoption. Findings reveal that religious factors are among the strongest predictors of opposition to same-sex adoption, but that religious tradition has no significant effect on support for same-sex adoption once frequency of religious practice and beliefs about the Bible are held constant. Americans who more frequently engage in practices such as religious service attendance and sacred text reading are less supportive of same-sex adoption, and compared to biblical literalists, those who believe the Bible requires interpretation, contains human error, or is a book of history/legends are all more likely to support same-sex adoption.

In our analysis, we make use of random variation in the field period of the European Social Survey (ESS) to fashion a natural experimental design. The survey’s field period took place in Germany from August 23, 2016, to March 26, 2017. Hence, the Christmas market attack took place approximately halfway through the ESS’s field phase, thus making it possible to study the causal effect on changing attitudes toward minorities before and after the attack. We argue that the terrorist attack creates a spillover effect and negatively shapes public opinion of uninvolved ethnic minorities. Our data analysis suggests that immediately after the event, only people with a right-wing political attitude appear to be affected by the proposed spillover effect. However, we find that the worsening of attitudes toward refugees can also be observed in the general population as time progresses.

xn9uj,preprints,2019-02-27,2020-02-24,2019-02-27,NA,NA,After Coming Out: Parental Acceptance of Young Lesbian and Gay People,"This study examines extant scholarly knowledge on parental acceptance of young lesbian and gay people in traditional heteronormative families. Recent literature shows that parents generally accept their 
lesbian and gay children. However, parents do not always accept them immediately after they  come out. Acceptance takes time, and transitioning to acceptance is often a complex process that depends on parents’ access to the   necessary resources for coping with the stresses of knowing that their child identifies as lesbian or gay. These resources include counseling or therapy, supportive friends and extended family, and a network of other parents with lesbian and gay children. This study also highlights the need for further research on parental acceptance in non-traditional families and of children with other non-heterosexual identities, such as asexuality, gray ace, bisexuality, or pansexuality. It also calls for an exploration of the complexities of parental acceptance as an ongoing process rather than as a singular event.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-02-27T11:25:49.438179,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn9uj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn9uj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn9uj/citation/,xn9uj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn9uj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn9uj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn9uj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c761c6062c82a0019dce73f/,5c761c6062c82a0019dce73f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn9uj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn9uj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xn9uj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xn9uj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xn9uj,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Specifically, we aimed to determine if the participants’ familiarity with the irrelevant speech’s talker affected the magnitude of the irrelevant sound effect. Experiment 1was an exploration of talker familiarity established in a natural listening environment(i.e. a university classroom)in which we manipulated the participants’ relationships with the talker. In Experiment 2 we manipulated the participants’ familiarity with the talker via 4 days of controlled exposure to the target talker’s audio recordings. For both Experiments1 and 2, a robust effect of irrelevant speech was found; however, regardless of the talker manipulation, talker familiarity did not influence the size of the effect.

Academy at the beginning of the 20th century by reconstructing the spiritual biographies of two theological academy professors: Archimandrite (later, Archbishop

the spiritual experience of these figures. The author of the article argues that, as a result of revolutionary events in 1917–1919, both Kyiv Theological Academy professors experienced transformations in personal cultural identity, and their spiritual biographies reveal a transition from Russian to Western European and a combination of both (Tykhon (Liashchenko) identities), and from Russian to Ukrainian ideological cultural orientation (Petro Kudriavtsev).

In this context this paper tries to find evidence supporting the reality of weak-form efficiency of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) by examining the issues of market risk-return relationship and market depth or liquidity for DSE. The study uses a data set of daily market index and returns for the period of 1994 to 2005 and weekly market capital turnover in proportion of total market capital for the period of 1994 to 2005. The paper also looks about the market risk (systemic risk) and return where it is found that market rate of return of DSE is very low or sometimes negative. Eventually Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), which envisages the relationship between risk and the expected rate of return on a risky security, is found unrelated in DSE market. As proper risk-return relationships of the market is seems to be deficient in DSE and the market is not liquid, interest of the available investors are bring into being very insignificant.

These essays were written by 56 Swedish university students studying English as a second language at three different educational levels. The results reveal that while there were clear links between mid-essay corrections/comments and grades given, the links between mid-essay corrections/comments and end comments were not only comparatively few, but less clear. Moreover, although valued highly in the research literature because of their ability to promote writing skills in an enhanced manner, there were more summative end comments than formative ones. The conclusion was, therefore, drawn that it is quite taxing for assessors, even for experienced ones, to produce connections that involve an alignment among a) mid-essay corrections/comments, b) end comments and c) grade that will, at the same time, promote students’ writing skills in accordance with what is suggested by the research literature. The assessors were, however, irrespective of grade given, attuned to the educational level at hand, focusing more on analytic aspects at the two lower levels, while taking a more holistic approach at the highest educational level.

Previously thought to be a sparsely occupied environment, archaeologists have recorded hundreds of geometric earthworks between the Purús and Acre rivers in recent years, spurring renewed interest in understanding the distribution, age, and function of these structures. A challenge has been to identify possible relationships between sites and to place them in their broader landscape setting. The precise spatial scale, relative importance of different factors, and strength of any relationships that contributed to shaping their distributions remain an open question. This paper develops and applies an explicitly spatial framework to address this problem, drawing on a rich body of recent research in Acre state (Brazil) and advanced point process modelling.

This chapter focuses on the fact- finding aspect. In this sense, science can be viewed as a process of signal detection for facts. We wish to discover true associations between variables. However, our methods for measurement are imprecise. We sometimes mistake noise for signal, and vice versa. How we conceptualize the scientific enterprise shapes how we go about the business of conducting research as well as how we strive to improve scientific practices. In this chapter, I’ll present several models of science. I’ll begin by showing ways in which the classic “hypothesis testing” model of science is misleading, and leads to flawed inferences. As a remedy, I’ll discuss models that treat science as a population process, with important dynamics at the group level that trickle down to the individual practitioners.

Management commitment is a critical issue as lack of it could lead to failures in governance, fraud, inefficacy, corruption as well as weak financial management, particularly in the public sector. This study evaluated the state of present practices of management commitment among public sector employees from various Malaysian service schemes. Primary data were collected using a questionnaire survey approach with 194 heads of departments in the Malaysian federal ministries. The collection of data was in accordance with the perspective of 10 factors in management commitment practices, using a five-point Likert scale. Factor analysis and descriptive statistics were utilized for data analysis. In addition, data reliability was checked by Cronbach’s alpha test, data normality was examined by Skewness and Kurtosis tests, and data validity was tested by using Kaiser-Meyer Olkin test and Barlett’s test. The findings show that 97% of the participants reported that they practised management commitment within their departments. Nevertheless, the priority for these management commitment factors varied according to the service schemes. In general, management commitment practice was the highest within the groups that used the finance scheme and the lowest among the employees who were under the accounting and audit schemes.

These frameworks are based preferentially on conceptual approaches, which leads to biases when applied in practice. Here, we present a study with an alternate focus: the skills proposed in the frameworks are connected with user behavior and heuristics are employed to group these skills. The objectives of the study were to: (1) achieve a greater coherence between the skills incorporated in these frameworks and user behavior, and (2) identify and reliably organize the clusters of skills that form frameworks. The study consisted of collecting data from a group of students about their practices within the skills of the Mozilla Web Literacy Map. The data was then grouped via factor analysis. The results were then contrasted with the initial organization of the Mozilla framework. The gap between the theoretical definition of a skill and individual behaviors was found to be more pronounced in the case of those skills whose definitions included a wider range of concepts and practices.

This paper argues that, because of the tariff’s role in the societal decision making process, it should not be understood as merely a statistical model, but as a major instrument of democratic participation.

Two decades later such concerns had virtually disappeared. Rather than as a problem, IFDI were now portrayed as a solution - even symbols of national economic success. To better understand the ideational dynamics underlying this remarkable transformation in perceptions of IFDI, this research traces the evolution of economic discourses in the United Kingdom over the post-war period. Deviating from conventional accounts in constructivist IPE, the investigation indicates that the rise of first-generation neoliberal discourses in the 1980s played only a secondary role in these processes. Instead, the discursive reshaping of IFDI was primarily driven by the rise of the narrative of national competitiveness in the early 1990s – a discourse inspired by managerial rather than neoclassical economic theory. Building a framework that prioritizes (multinational) firms over national economies, the rise of this second-generation neoliberal narrative played a critical role in promoting now taken-for-granted imaginaries of the global economy as an economic ”race” between nations-as-platforms-of-production. The findings highlight both the ideational underbelly of the rise of the competition state and how it re-shaped dominant social representations of IFDI.",TRUE,FALSE,business schools|competitiveness|economic ideas|foreign direct investments|United Kingdom,2019-07-10T12:50:41.364278,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,Lukas Linsi,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/citation/,s4j6y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d24bd82a26b340019063aca/,5d24bd82a26b340019063aca,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s4j6y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s4j6y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s4j6y,https://doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2019.1687557,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

this massage reach to the ends of the earth for the evangelization of all, both the Jews and Gentiles,
he selected twelve apostles out of the disciples that followed him. These twelve he molded and
made the ""light"" of the world and ""salt"" of the earth and urged them to let their light shine so that
people will see their light and glorify their father who is in heaven (Matt. 5:13-16). It is this
twelve that followed him from the inception of his ministry to the end of his ministry. The
implication is that they were with him from his baptism to his ascension. Having formed the
Twelve, he sent them on a mission to evangelize the whole world. The aim of this article is to
restate anew the inseparability of formation and mission in the work of evangelization and their
indispensability in the work of evangelization. This paper argues that if the mandate of Jesus in

Moreover, recent literature finds that exposure to one event tends to increase risk of the other. However, next to nothing is known about the size or composition – or changes therein – of the divorced/separated and unemployed (DSU) subpopulation. Using large, nationally representative, repeated cross-sectional datasets extending back to 1984, we aim to fill this gap for the UK. We give a descriptive account of the prevalence and social distribution of DSU, and of the cross-sectional association between its two component states: among which groups, by education and gender, does being either divorced/separated or unemployed most strongly imply a heightened risk of also being the other, and how has this changed over time? We find stable and strong educational inequality in DSU, while the gender gap has narrowed and recently closed. The association between the two states is stronger among men; has weakened strikingly over the time period we consider, for both men and, especially, women; and is educationally stratified among men but not women. Contrary to expectations, higher-educated men in one of the two states are most likely to also be in the other. Possible explanations and further questions are discussed. In particular, we highlight the possibility that over this time period the divorced/separated have become more like the general population, rather than a negatively selected subgroup among whom unemployment is a particular risk.",TRUE,FALSE,cumulative disadvantage|divorced|job loss|marital dissolution|repartnering|unemployed,2019-07-29T12:35:25.905922,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-29,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/citation/,yj6t4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pyc76/,pyc76,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d3ece4a596eee001d64998a/,5d3ece4a596eee001d64998a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yj6t4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yj6t4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yj6t4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

As agriculture is one of the major consumers of freshwater, more yield or output using same or less amount of water has become the global interest. Therefore water productivity (WP) is also considered as an indicator of agricultural productivity. Several research works have been conducted on WP values of different yields, tools and technologies to improve WP. Most of the studies on water productivity considered the crop productivity using limited water resource and searched for better technologies for improving crop water productivity. Researchers also concentrated on improving irrigation efficiency or water use efficiency at field level for irrigation through water management and for yielding more crops. But there is a research gap in assessing values of water productivity in aquatic ecosystems especially floodplain areas. A floodplain area remains dry and flooded in two different seasons. Thus, a combined valuation of aquatic resources and rice production in two different seasons are very important to measure the efficient usages of the lands. So, this study deals with how to measure annual aggregate water productivity for dry season and flood season in a floodplain beel area.",TRUE,FALSE,Floodplain; Beel; Water Productivity; Fish-Rice Culture,2019-02-28T19:27:09.383549,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/citation/,q3ayc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3su2k/,3su2k,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c776db382a3950017d59b4f/,5c776db382a3950017d59b4f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q3ayc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q3ayc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q3ayc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Indeed, visual sequences of punctuation from different authors produce marvelously different (and visually striking) sequences. Punctuation is a largely overlooked stylistic feature in ``stylometry'', the quantitative analysis of written text. In this paper, we examine punctuation sequences in a corpus of literary documents and ask the following questions: Are the properties of such sequences a distinctive feature of different authors? Is it possible to distinguish literary genres based on their punctuation sequences? Do the punctuation styles of authors evolve over time? Are we on to something interesting in trying to do stylometry without words, or are we full of sound and fury (signifying nothing)?",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-01-01T13:21:27.115741,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-01,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|Arts and Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dff|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Computational Linguistics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/citation/,2rzsg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2acbdda7c0a700193c293a/,5c2acbdda7c0a700193c293a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2rzsg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2rzsg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2rzsg,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This chapter attempts to understand what is driving this uncharacteristic focus on the Navy, concentrating on developments in the 20-year period since the end of the Cold War (1991–2011). The analysis proceeds in two parts. The first section examines several different measures, including number of ships, aggregate tonnage, number of missile cells and budgetary allocation to understand the trajectory of the Indian Navy over the past 20 years. Section two examines three oft-cited justifications for naval expansion – defence against hostile maritime powers, the cultivation of power projection capability to further India’s political interests, and the protection of trade – in relation to the fleet’s actual platform acquisitions to determine their relative importance in driving naval development. The available data suggests that the primary mission driving naval modernization is sea-lane security, with the development of ‘softer’ aspects of power projection capability receiving some support, while the need to deter hostile maritime powers does little to explain India’s recent naval modernization. This focus on enhancing India’s ability to provide regional ‘public goods,’ such as sea-lane security and humanitarian response, strongly suggests that this growing naval strength can emerge as a net positive for the region.",TRUE,FALSE,India|Indo-Pacific|navy|power projection|seapower,2019-12-23T17:31:21.343678,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/citation/,8xf7y,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e00641afad25100096daa31/,5e00641afad25100096daa31,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8xf7y/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8xf7y/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8xf7y,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It uses a sequential logit model to study the changing impact of family background on educational transitions and educational attainment, comparing birth cohorts that completed their schooling during different stages of the market transition process. Data are derived from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), a large and nationally representative household survey that provides detailed retrospective information. The findings show that in reform-era China educational inequality has increased despite large-scale educational expansion. Since the onset of the market reforms the importance of social origin has continuously increased, particularly at the crucial transition to senior high school.

Early selfies were often taken with webcams hooked up to desktop computers and are more stationary in character. They are taken within the home, within the intimacy of the living room or bedroom, and mostly focus exclusively on the photographer’s face. But the prevalence of camera- and internet-enabled smartphones has brought the selfie into the outside world. A selfie today is as much about the photographer’s surroundings as it is about the photographer themselves. Considering how selfies are intricately linked with various social media platforms, the selfie cannot be considered to be just a visual object or cultural representation. Instead, of just being a cultural product, the selfie is intricately tied up in producing social media culture . Selfies are viewed, ‘liked’, commented on and shared onwards by followers and friends on social media platforms as well as by more traditional media. Since smartphones have enabled the selfie to untether itself from the living room webcam, naturally the geography of the selfie and how it produces representations of places becomes an important and intriguing subject. This amplified further by the fact that many selfies are explicitly geotagged. That is, users of social media platforms such as Instagram and Twitter choose to add a specific geographic location to the selfie they are uploading. With this implicit indication that the location of that photo is somehow important, we ask ‘what is the geography of the selfie?’.

To answer these questions, this article uses a global dataset of geotagged selfies posted to Twitter since the summer of 2012 (cf. Poorthuis et al., 2016). By matching based on keywords and hashtags related to selfies, a dataset of ~10 million tweets and their corresponding images is extracted. The empirical section on the article consists of two parts. In the first part, characteristics of these selfies are compared with random samples that represent all tweets and all tweets with images attached, respectively. These datasets are mapped and visualized to analyze the geographic distribution of selfie production.",TRUE,FALSE,selfie|Twitter,2019-09-29T21:28:23.129009,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-29,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/citation/,uw954,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d90be81c43280001cc64633/,5d90be81c43280001cc64633,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uw954/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uw954/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uw954,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Besides, the pronunciation of Huni resembles吴回(wuhui). From the paper I speculate that the eagle in the statue unearthed in Taibo's tomb and the eagle in a statue of a man, dating from the State of Yue era, the eagles in the two statues resemble the God Horus in Egypt, so I can also get a conclusion that Wuxi(无锡) and Zhejiang(浙江) was once Egypt’s colony. I can also get a conclusion that Zhangshan Hill(嶂山)means Egypt governor or pharaoh had come to Wuxi. 
Besides, we can get a conclusion that Chanshan Hill(产山)is a man-made pyramid, and Heliekou(河埒口)means enclosure around the man-made pyramid- Chanshan Hill, this pyramid complex looks like Djoser's Pyramid Complex which has enclosure around it. From the paper, we can conclude that Huishan clay figurines（惠山泥人）are ushabtis with Chinese characteristic, it indicates that Wuxi（无锡）was the colony of ancient Egypt. So Wuxi（无锡）means binding spot, Mount Xi（锡山）means a binding hill. And the ruins of Mount Xi(锡山) resemble ""Pyramid of Khufu"" in Giza pyramid complex.

However, in Saudi Arabia, students have difficulties learning English, especially those taught with traditional teacher-centered methods. In contrast, in the constructivist and cooperative learning methods, textbooks and teachers are no longer the only sources of information; their primary task is facilitating interaction among students and connecting students’ prior knowledge with new information. The present study investigates the effects of using the 5Es teaching model on EFL female students’ motivation and achievement at Taif University. Likewise, it may contribute to the literature on the 5Es model with EFL students’ motivation and achievement. The sample included 119 female Saudi undergraduate students studying English as a foreign language (EFL) at the first level at Taif University, in Saudi Arabia.  They study English language with a focus on reading, writing, listening and speaking, for 6 hours weekly over one academic semester. The sample was divided into a control group (n = 61) and an experimental group (n = 58). Two research questions were addressed to examine whether: (1) there are significant differences between the experimental group scores and the control group scores on post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’ motivation and their achievement and (2) there are significant differences between the mean scores of the pre-test and post-tests of the students’ motivation and their achievement for the experimental group. The researcher designed a program incorporating the 5Es model of teaching and learning which was used with the experimental group for ten weeks in 20 sessions. The 5Es model program provides the basis for learners to construct an accurate understanding of a new concept based on existing knowledge. In contrast, the researcher used traditional instruction with the control group for the same period. Besides the 5Es program, the two groups were asked to answer questions on a 5-point Likert-scale motivation questionnaire before and after the instruction to compare changes on students’ motivation.  The following statistics calculations were performed: t-test, mean, SD, and Pearson coefficient correlations to analyze the data. The results showed that there are significant differences between the mean scores of the experimental and control groups on the post-tests of the EFL female Saudi students’ motivation and their achievement in favor of the experimental group. Moreover, statistically significant differences were found in the mean scores of the pre-test and post-tests of the students’ motivation and their achievement for the experimental group, in favor of post-test.",TRUE,FALSE,5Es model|achievement|EFL female Saudi students|motivation|training program,2019-07-19T19:11:42.375119,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/citation/,3cbek,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cafae4aa3bc970019eda394/,5cafae4aa3bc970019eda394,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3cbek/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3cbek/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3cbek,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/th.231,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There is a law to promote whistleblowing practices, but the negative subsequent effect of whistleblowing demotivates the reporting of unethical behaviours. Thus, it is important to identify the factors that motivate an employee to exercise whistleblowing in an organization. Therefore, this study aims to examine whether the personal factor of job satisfaction and organizational factors such as fair treatment as well as cooperativeness contribute to the whistleblowing practice in an organization.
Design/methodology/approach: This study collected primary data based on a questionnaire survey from 73 respondents of the seven top most GLCs in Malaysia. The data are analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and cross-sectional regression.
Findings: The findings of the study reveal that only fair treatment is statistically significant and positively related to the whistleblowing practice. The findings imply that if employees perceive that the organization provides fair treatment in terms of career advancement, awards, training, performance appraisal, job assignment, and pay increases, they would tend to report wrongdoing activities to protect the image of the organization.
Practical implications: The findings of the study will help the policy makers to ensure better working environment and accountability in the public sector of Malaysia and other similar countries.
Originality/value: This is an original study based on primary data to examine the current practices of whistleblowing and its relationship with the practices of job satisfaction, fair treatment, and cooperativeness in the government linked companies of Malaysia.",TRUE,FALSE,Government Linked Company (GLC); Job Satisfaction; Fair Treatment; Cooperativeness; Whistleblowing practice,2019-06-14T15:58:28.261924,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vd2eh/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vd2eh/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vd2eh/citation/,vd2eh,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vd2eh/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vd2eh/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/96hpd/,96hpd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vd2eh/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d021d8635988f001bde773b/,5d021d8635988f001bde773b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vd2eh/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vd2eh/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vd2eh/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vd2eh/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vd2eh,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Una mirada desde las comunidades marginadas en Puerto Rico,"Las comunidades marginadas en Puerto Rico presentan cicatrices sociales por la estigmatización, desigualdad y falta de oportunidades experimentadas durante décadas. Está obra recoge expresiones de este sector tradicionalmente marginado por el gobierno, mercado y la misma sociedad puertorriqueña. Dos son los principales propósitos del libro: (1) realizar un análisis histórico del desarrollo e institucionalización del Estado de bienestar emergente en Puerto Rico, y (2) examinar las relaciones del bienestar y la distribución de riesgos sociales entre los principales actores garantes del bienestar en las comunidades marginadas del archipiélago caribeño.

Para cumplir el primer propósito se realiza una revisión histórica sobre el desarrollo de las instituciones y programas del bienestar puertorriqueño. El segundo objetivo del libro se materializa mediante la exposición de datos y relatos recopilados mediante entrevistas semiestructuradas y encuestas en siete comunidades marginadas del país (Daguao, Dulces Labios, El Rabanal, Playita Cortada, San Antón, Toro Negro y Tras Talleres).

El valor añadido de este libro a los estudios de regímenes de bienestar es la conceptualización de la comunidad como uno de los principales actores garantes del bienestar junto a la familia, Estado y mercado. Asimismo, se demuestra el grado de (des)mercantilización, (des)familiarización y estadocentrismo/residualismo de los programas de bienestar puertorriqueños en las áreas de vivienda, maternidad/paternidad, educación, alimentación, salud, incapacidad, (des)empleo y vejez.

Due to the complicatedness of this skill, many teachers find it difficult to make their learners aware of the divergent phases of writing so they produce better compositions. Thus, the professionalism of teachers is inevitably essential in shaping the learners’ writing ability (assisting students as they develop a piece of writing, and boosting their engagement with writing), and learners can achieve successful learning outcomes if they grasp how best to improve their work. To make language learning more effective, there is a need for pursuing professional growth and providing conditions where teachers cooperate to attain higher levels of learning among their students. Indeed, professional development for a teacher is about acquiring new skills, creating a potent learning atmosphere, surmounting the barriers, rectifying the failures and moving forward. It provides ongoing opportunities for educators to continue to identify teaching/learning problems, develop solutions, raise their performance, address students’ needs and up their achievements. The present paper sets out to take a closer look at how teachers work with writing among the first year English as foreign language (EFL) students. It tends to offer an instruction based on a set of professional development methods that provide practitioners with several avenues to implement them in classroom practice. To this end, findings of the research indicate that the proposed strategies can lead to a virtuous bond between the teaching/learning process of written expression that may generate beneficial knowledge, valuable teaching, and constructive learning results.",TRUE,FALSE,EFL students|professional development|writing|written expression,2019-07-20T21:30:43.935495,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/citation/,5yhgj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa43b1df977b0019f42787/,5caa43b1df977b0019f42787,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5yhgj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5yhgj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5yhgj,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This is the main puzzle raised in this paper. The argument is that the decision to stage elections and democratize is highly strategic and depends on the ethnic size of the post-conflict government leader. Especially post-conflict leaders with large ethnic support are able to utilize quick post-conflict elections to stabilize and legitimize their political position. However, in the long run the government leaders prefer institutions that maximize their time in office and therefore will hinder full scale democratization.

While systems of informal control are by their very nature more decentralized and unorganized, can systems of informal social control come to resemble centralized systems of formal control? This article offers a highly detailed empirical analysis of a particular form of informal social control in a highly observable setting over time: fist-fighting in the National Hockey League. Fighting is commonly understood to be both an instrument of retaliatory “self-help” exercised by all players, but also the semi-exclusive domain of “enforcers” or “goons” who are employed by teams to physically retaliate on behalf of their opponents and deter violent play in others. A 52-year record of nearly 30,000 fist fights between players is analyzed alongside other player statistics. An analysis of the player distribution, network structure, and in-game contexts of these fights demonstrates a gradual shift from a system of self-help to a system of specialized enforcement. This shift is connected to larger changes in the size of the league and the talent pool, processes of specialization at the level of the team, and the emergence of an unofficial “enforcer” role that motivates participation in fights for certain players.",TRUE,FALSE,hockey|sanctioning|social control|social networks,2019-02-22T04:23:28.401736,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-22,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/citation/,j9qpd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6eb3ca82a395001ac91d7f/,5c6eb3ca82a395001ac91d7f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9qpd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j9qpd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j9qpd,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
tvbcz,preprints,2019-02-12,2019-02-13,2019-02-13,NA,NA,Factors influencing low prevalence of neurodevelopmental disabilities among Hispanic/Latino children,"Objectives. Hispanic/Latino children have substantially lower prevalence of neurodevelopmental disabilities than other groups (Boyle et al., 2011; Froehlich et al., 2007; Pedersen et al., 2012). The explanation for variations in prevalence are complex, but are generally thought to be related to language barriers and lack of access to and utilization of healthcare services. Previous research focused on how language barriers and lack of access to and utilization of healthcare services affects children with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD), but no research has examined whether these factors predict NDD. This study extends prior research by examining if social and environmental factors explain low prevalence of NDD in this population. 

Methods. This study uses nationally representative Integrated Public Use Microdata Series National Health Interview Survey data and multivariate analyses to compare NDD prevalence in whites and Hispanics/Latinos and examines whether healthcare access, healthcare utilization, language barriers, and length of time living in the United States (U.S.) explains this disability disparity. 

Results. Findings reveal that the H/L NDD disparity is not explained by differences in access to or utilization of healthcare, or as a result of spoken language differences that may create barriers to NDD diagnosis. However, while H/Ls born in the U.S. have lower rates of NDD than whites, H/Ls who were not born in the U.S. have even lower probability of NDD than H/Ls who were born in the U.S. 

Conclusions. These findings may be a result of cultural differences in understanding of disability knowledge, differential treatment within the U.S. healthcare system, avoidance of the U.S. healthcare system out of mistrust, or difficulty navigating the complex U.S. healthcare system.

Research documents the struggles of individuals trying to find their way back into society. Less attention has been given to the organizational aspects of reentry. This is unfortunate given the rapid growth of nonprofit reentry organizations in the U.S., which introduces a new set of questions about the context and challenges to prisoner reentry. Drawing on an ethnography of Safe, a nonprofit reentry organization in the Northeast, I describe the organization's pivotal role in institutionalizing the pathway to prisoner reentry: a road to reentry, which takes former prisoners through a process that reconfigures their morality, identity, and social relationships. The road to reentry concept helps bring together scholars of the welfare state and criminology by highlighting how the challenges of prisoner reentry rely on how this process is organized. The way in which prison reentry is organized, in turn, affects former prisoners' agency and shapes the relationship between these men and women and their respective families and communities.",TRUE,FALSE,agency|criminology|ethnography|organizations|prisoner re-entry|structure|welfare state,2019-03-05T12:22:47.650582,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-05,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/citation/,5kr3x,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xcsqa/,xcsqa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c7d0d2cff4a89001925e248/,5c7d0d2cff4a89001925e248,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/5kr3x/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/5kr3x/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/5kr3x,https://doi.org/10.1111/socf.12254,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Eleven (11) nurses working for at least three (3) years from three (3) selected hemodialysis units within Metro Manila participated in this study. Multiple face to face in-depth interviews, story-telling sessions and non-participatory observation were utilized to create the individual narratives from where the patterns and expressions of caring were later explicated. 
After a series of content analysis following the focused ethnography design, three patterns and expressions of caring were then identified: (1) being at the moment, (2) transcending perceived boundaries and (3) harmonizing with technology. These patterns represent for informants their unique expressions of caring in the context of working in a hemodialysis unit. It reflects a moment to moment transitioning between caring for and caring with persons thru technology.
Insights from this study suggest that the nature of caring as articulated by the informants is an expression of their anticipated role as career within the moment and their perceived image of the person being cared for. 
Professional role clarification, fluency in communication and technological competency training were implied as possible ways of strengthening their perception of being caring which in the end could improve patient outcomes.

This study is based on primary data that were collected in Jul-Oct 2012 through a questionnaire survey on 460 poor and low income households from the Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu States of Malaysia. The sample was selected from E-Kasih poor household database based on cluster random sampling technique.

In the case of the International Civic and Citizenship Education Study (ICCS 2009), along with  civic knowledge there are a series of relevant instruments for measuring citizenship related concepts as attitudes, beliefs and behavior. In order to facilitate and estimulate the use of these questionnaires, this database incorporates variables constructed on the basis of compound indices (estimated with IRT) of those scales that address the same topic, such as trust in institutions, participation, school climate, attitudes towards minorities and ethnic groups, among others. Many times these variables are used as they come in the database, without stopping to analyze or problematize the validity of these measurements and their consequences in terms of analysis and contrast of hypotheses.

The main contributor to this process is always the teacher who has to adhere to the process of change for the purposes of developing his/her own career and improving the quality of teaching. This study aims to determine how action research would improve quality teaching in pre-service and in-service teacher training, and shed light on the reciprocal relationship between action research and innovation. In this paper, action research is considered as a constant independent variable that can enhance the dependent variables of pre-service / in-service teacher training and quality teaching requirements. The latter are supposed to be two purposes of innovation. Innovation is, thus, performed as the usual practice of innovative teachers who take risks of improving quality teaching in a methodological procedure according to their teaching contexts. The study attempts to answer the following questions: What is quality teaching and how does it impact innovation within the quality teaching assurance framework? What is action research and how does it help teachers improve their research and innovation potential?

hbg3m,preprints,2019-11-26,2021-04-19,2019-11-27,NA,NA,Graphical Causal Models for Survey Inference,"Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are now a popular tool to inform causal inferences. Departing from their informal use in the survey research literature, we discuss how DAGs can also be used to encode theoretical assumptions about nonprobability samples and survey nonresponse and to determine whether population quantities, including conditional distributions and regressions, can be identified from a sample. We describe sources of bias and assumptions for eliminating it in selection scenarios familiar from the missing data literature.

dynamics of the modern social order. The implications of modern society on the nature of being human in a social world are vast, as demonstrated by the myriad upheavals witnessed since the ‘long’ 19th century2. But what are the implications of modern society on what it means to be a moral  being? How do individualism and social solidarity coexist? The following addresses the complexity of these questions by analyzing Weber and Durkheim’s perspectives on the transition to modern life and the relationship between modern society and the individual. With Marx as a theoretical backdrop, this essay examines how Weber and Durkheim conceived of the problems of modern society by underscoring the dualities that are reflected in autonomy, authority, rationalization, and other dimensions of structure inherent within social organization and interdependence. These concomitant dualities evince the necessary doubleness of the human condition and how it enmeshes society in a “poverty of morality” (Durkheim,  Suicide , p. 387) that is in need of a new moral order and greater social solidarity.",TRUE,FALSE,classical social theory|duality of structure|durkheim|political sociology|weber,2019-05-14T13:01:21.239644,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e53|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Altruism, Morality, and Social Solidarity",Jules Ostro,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/citation/,3uvkr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bc8w9/,bc8w9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cd9da1f2d1b9e001ca25cc8/,5cd9da1f2d1b9e001ca25cc8,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3uvkr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3uvkr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3uvkr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In contrast to previous studies, the model relies on the probability distribution of a default time/jump rather than the default time itself, as the default time is usually inaccessible. As such, the model can achieve a high order of accuracy with a relatively easy implementation. We find that the valuation of a defaultable derivative is normally determined via backward induction when their payoffs could be positive or negative.

The historical CO2 emission performance data also indicate that the iron and steel, chemical, paper and pulp and cement were the top four largest industrial emitters, and these top four emitting industries contributed nearly two-third of the industrial sector‟s total CO2 emission amount during 1990-2015. Evidently, any appropriate efforts or strategies guided by an empirical investigation like this are expected to help Japan‟s industrial emitters move toward a more tolerable and less polluted carbon footprint, which is well-matched with the country‟s commitment to Kyoto Protocol. This study is thus an effort to empirically investigate the causality and long-run trend/relationship between Japan‟s industrial production and CO2 emissions and to propose some corporate environmental strategies using the econometric techniques of Vector Error Correction (VEC) and Granger causality. It found that there exists no Granger causality between Japan‟s industrial production and CO2 emissions in any direction. But the VEC estimation reveals that an increase in Japan‟s industrial production by 1% is associated with a 0.08% increase in the country‟s CO2 emissions. It also reveals that any disequilibrium between Japan‟s industrial production and CO2 emissions could take about 0.7 quarters for half of the error to be corrected for. The adjustment rate for Japan‟s industrial production is found to be positive but quite slow at the rate of 0.08% per year. Since Japan‟s CO2 emissions vis-à-vis its industrial production is found to have reached above the long-run equilibrium level, its industrial sector is expected to encounter with stricter government regulations requiring reduction of CO2 emissions to the targeted/equilibrium level in the future.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-06-14T16:01:27.369118,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/citation/,zb2dv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kqbr9/,kqbr9,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0228bd7b8c4d00189af71e/,5d0228bd7b8c4d00189af71e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/zb2dv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zb2dv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/zb2dv,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

n8j5w,preprints,2019-11-04,2020-06-04,2019-11-05,NA,NA,Measurement in the study of menstrual health and hygiene: A systematic review and audit,"Background. The lack of established measurement tools in the study of menstrual health and hygiene has been identified as a significant limitation of quantitative studies to date. However, there has been limited exploration of existing measurement to identify avenues for improvement. 
Methods. We undertook two linked systematic reviews of (1) trials of menstrual health interventions and their nested studies in low- and middle-income countries, (2) studies developing or validating measures of menstrual experiences from any location. Systematic searching was undertaken in 12 databases, together with handsearching. We iteratively grouped and audited concepts measured across included studies and extracted and compared measures of each concept.
Results. A total of 23 trials, 9 nested studies and 22 measure development studies were included. Trials measured a range of outcomes including menstrual knowledge, attitudes, and practices, school absenteeism, and health. Most measure validation studies focused on assessing attitudes towards menstruation, while a group of five studies assessed the accuracy of women’s recall of their menstrual characteristics such as timing and cycle length. Measures of menstrual knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and restrictions were inconsistent and frequently overlapped. No two studies measured the same menstrual or hygiene practices, with 44 different practices assessed. This audit provides a summary of current measures and extant efforts to pilot or test their performance. 
Conclusions. Inconsistencies in both the definition and operationalisation of concepts measured in menstrual health and hygiene research should be addressed. To improve measurement, authors should clearly define the constructs they aim to measure and outline how these were operationalised for measurement. Results of this audit indicate the need for the development and validation of new measures, and the evaluation of the performance of existing measures across contexts. In particular, the definition and measurement of menstrual practices, knowledge, attitudes, norms and restrictions should be addressed.

This paper couples a meta-narrative literature review with expert interviews to explore how socio-technical regimes associated with centralised systems of provision (i.e. the prevailing paradigm in many countries around the world) differ to those of smart local energy systems (SLES). Findings show how SLES regimes incorporate niche technologies, business models and governance structures to enable new forms of localised operation and optimisation (e.g. automated network management), smarter decision making and planning, by new actors (e.g. local authorities, other local stakeholders), and engaging users in new ways. Through this they are expected to deliver on a wide range of outcomes, both within the SLES boundary and to the wider system.

However, it also introduces new potential security threats and risks. These include threats that range from the direct hacking of devices
that could undermine the security, privacy and safety of its users, to the enslaving of IoT devices to commit cybercrime at scale, such as Denial of Service attacks. The IoT is recognised as being widely insecure, in large part, due to the lack of security features built into devices. Additionally, consumers
do not always actively use security features when available. More disconcerting is that we lack market surveillance on whether manufacturers ship products with good security features or how the importance of user-controlled security features is explained to IoT users. Our study seeks to address this gap. To do this, we compiled a database of 270 consumer IoT devices produced by 220 different manufacturers on sale at the time of the study. The user manuals and associated support pages for these devices were then analysed to provide a “consumer eye” view of the security features they provide and the cyber hygiene advice that is communicated to users. The security features identified were then mapped to the UK Government's Secure by Design Code of Practice for IoT devices to examine the extent to which devices currently on the market appear to conform to it. Our findings suggest that manufacturers provide too little publicly-available information about the security features of their devices which makes market surveillance challenging and provides consumers with little information about the security of devices prior to their purchase. On average, there was discussion of around four security features, with account
management and software updates being the most frequently mentioned. Advice to consumers on cyber hygiene was also rarely provided. Finally, we found a lack of standardisation in the communication of security-related information for IoT devices among our sample.

Executive Report.,"In an era of mass migration, social scientists, populist parties and social movements raise concerns over the future of immigration-destination societies. What impacts does this have on policy and social solidarity? Comparative cross-national research, relying mostly on secondary data, has findings in different directions. There is a threat of selective model reporting and lack of replicability. The heterogeneity of countries obscures attempts to clearly define data-generating models. P-hacking and HARKing lurk among standard research practices in this area.
This project employs crowdsourcing to address these issues. It draws on replication, deliberation, meta-analysis and harnessing the power of many minds at once.

We extend previous work from Europe, where weak effects were found, in two ways. First, kin effects are likely to be context-dependent and differ by the type and generosity of the welfare state, and by mortality rates. Second, it may be that the grandparent derives more benefits from the grandchild as young child than a new-born or infant. We retest this hypothesis with longitudinal data from the US and England. Both these studies follow people for a longer time so we further test whether effects of grandparenting emerge later after the birth of the grandchild. We found no evidence for these hypotheses in either setting, with the exception of English women who reported higher subjective life expectancy after becoming a grandmother.

The present paper builds from this growing literature in its analysis of the formation of National Public Radio (NPR), to better understand how organizational actors translate racialized practices into new organizations at their foundation, even when they seek greater racial inclusivity. I coin a new analytical concept, white institutional isomorphism, to analyze how organizations that embrace a mission of diversity may end up reproducing racially exclusionary practices. White institutional isomorphic pressures are racialized norms that shape the standards and practices adopted across organizations within a given field. Using organizational meeting minutes, external reports, oral histories, and founder memoirs, I show that early implementation of station membership criteria, hiring practices, and programming priorities, while considered race-neutral decisions by the founders that shared a white habitus, inhibited the inclusion of nonwhite voices into NPR’s workforce, station membership, and programming.",TRUE,FALSE,diversity|organizations|race|radio|whiteness,2019-03-16T15:41:45.108558,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-16,FALSE,NA,no,"National Public Broadcasting Archives, College Park, Maryland",NA,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Laura Garbes,2021,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/citation/,tj5cs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8d0c65075b640019a3be05/,5c8d0c65075b640019a3be05,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tj5cs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tj5cs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tj5cs,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When put in traditional competitive settings, students worry more about their self-esteem and tend to shy away from participating in the activities, while, only those with higher level of oral skills volunteer in answering the questions. This inequity in practice causes a discrepancy in students’ performance in the oral expression exams and thus, results in a gap in the achievement. This paper suggests cooperative learning as a means to reduce the achievement gap between high and low achievers in the oral expression classes. This study is an endeavor to highlight the effectiveness of cooperative learning in reducing the disparity between high and low achievers and also to accentuate the benefits of this method in the English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom. The study followed an experimental pretest-posttest non-equivalent groups design with a sample of 44 second year EFL students from the University of Khenchela, Algeria. The intervention lasted for a semester. The results showed that the achievement gap was reduced in the experimental group after using cooperative learning instructions, while the traditional method, in the control group, failed in closing the achievement gap between high and low-achievers.

Teachers initiate learners to the whole learning process, and their feedback constitutes the significant step forward that triggers learners towards enunciating a language. As an illustration, Swain (1985, 2000) uses empirical evidence to show the importance of teacher’s feedback during the production of speaking. Relatable to feedback during oral activity are issues that highlight teachers’ pronunciation, fluency, body language, facial expressions, and error correction during the production phase. To identify these areas, the current article used students’ questionnaires. The general aim is to gauge learners’ perceptions, practices and problems. Results highlight the pivotal teachers’ role in the whole process. Therefore, the specific aim of this study is to investigate the role of teachers’ feedback during speaking activities in Moroccan classes.

Participants learned how to use the scientific method in real-world settings to generate new knowledge. In order to consolidate these knowledge gains and bolster the program’s inspirational power, capstone projects empowered participants to speak with NASA mission managers and, in some cases, acquire never-before-seen images of Mars. While longitudinal study and a more robust sample size are required to bolster conclusions about the efficacy of our approach, initial results suggest that Ad Astra programs significantly enhance self-efficacy and science-oriented career ambitions.",TRUE,FALSE,Astrobiology|Astronomy education|Mars exploration|Outreach for development|Student motivation,2019-11-20T12:22:42.397122,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d69|Education|Science and Mathematics Education|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d6f|Education|Educational Psychology|5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d70|Education|Educational Methods,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w4sp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w4sp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w4sp/citation/,7w4sp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w4sp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w4sp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/z8vng/,z8vng,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w4sp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd4d0f31d56d2000ddf57bb/,5dd4d0f31d56d2000ddf57bb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w4sp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w4sp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7w4sp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7w4sp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7w4sp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The study follows the methodological synergy approach proposed by Baker et al. (2008), a heuristic methodological approach that combines methods of discourse analysis and corpus-assisted statistical tools including keyword, collocation, and concordance analysis. Drawing on this methodological synergy approach, the investigation yields significant findings contextualized within the socio-economic-political context of the European Union (EU) leave referendum to trace how the issue of immigration is represented in the discourses of the Remain and Leave campaigns. The frequency results show that immigration is one of the most salient topics in the Brexit corpus. Concordance analysis of the word immigrants and collocation investigation of the word immigration reveal opposing attitudes toward immigration in the EU referendum debate. The analysis uncovers negative attitudes toward the uncontrolled flow of immigrants from other EU countries and public concerns about immigrants' negative impacts on wages, education, and health services. Other findings reveal positive attitudes toward immigrants emphasizing their positive contributions to the UK economy.

Seshat contains high-dimensional sociopolitical features for hundreds of polities, from multiple continents, over many thousands of years. Examining the statistical covariations among those social features, we find that the process of sociopolitical development is dominated first by growth in polity scale, then by improvements in its information processing and economic systems, and then by further increases in scale. This allows us to define a Scale Threshold for societies, beyond which growth in information processing becomes paramount, and an Information Threshold, which once crossed permits additional growth in scale. Polities diverge from one another in sociopolitical feature space prior to crossing the Information Threshold, but then reconverge.

One significant transition was the media image of the New Warrior – a warrior who’s sacrifice no longer transformed the nation. The NRA, emerging from the 1970s with a more hardline stance toward Second Amendment absolutism, played an active role in reshaping the relationship between this new warrior culture, military service, and the Second Amendment. Building on a narrative of government betrayal of the soldiers in Vietnam, the NRA recast the ordinary gun owner into the New Warrior, an independent warrior who will go to any lengths to defend the sacred right to bear arms against corrupt agents of the government. But the deeper question of how the NRA has accomplished this transformation of cultural meaning remains largely unexplored. This paper argues that the NRA used the rhetoric of national failure following Vietnam and the blood sacrifice of American soldiers who died in the defense of the Constitution to transform the cultural meaning of the Second Amendment for ordinary citizens. Through the Second Amendment, ordinary men are transformed into Second Amendment warriors, defending the freedoms the American soldiers died to protect. As one of the original real life heroes of the post-Vietnam New War -  a retired soldier who operated outside of the law in order to defend the Nation– Oliver North’s ascension to the NRA presidency represents the fulfillment of the post-Vietnam New War archetype and merges the New War mythology with the blood sacrifice of Christian nationalism.",TRUE,FALSE,american rifleman|blood sacrifice|conquest narrative|discourse analysis|gun culture|gun culture 2.0|guns|new warrior culture|NRA|oliver north|Religious nationalism|sacrifice|support the troops|warrior culture,2019-08-13T20:39:42.164045,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture,Jessica Dawson,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/citation/,2zyr6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d50ac4273347900196cca99/,5d50ac4273347900196cca99,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2zyr6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2zyr6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2zyr6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Grounded on the interpretive paradigm, forty two (42) participants were recruited to partake in this study. Further, reflection papers from the participants serve as the narratives of the study and where then reflectively analyze via the process of thematization. 

After the three (3) level of reflective analysis, the following themes were identified: (1) Dedication: Focused Learning; (2) Mastery of Professional Qualities; (3) Setbacks: Stress &amp; Weariness. The themes shows that in general, the overall experience of the participants was affirmative and optimistic claiming that LRSS promotes a conducive learning environment wherein they felt “less pressured” to perform task. Further the participants felt that the LRSS provides them with a mean to fully realize the development of their professional qualities, skills and attitude of a “real” nurse since it mirrors the realities of an “on-the-job-training”. Lastly, the identified setbacks of the LRSS are two-folds: stress and a sense of weariness, largely attribute to the consecutive days of duty schedules as well as a perceived monotony of activities in the area of exposure. 

Insights from this study suggest that there is a need to update and upgrade strategies and methodologies of teaching implemented in the clinical area to provide varied approaches to learning skills as well as limit the perception of monotony among student clinicians.

The first practitioners of this technique and mode of narrative reportedness are Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Richardson, and James Joyce, all of whom are modernist fictional writers who engaged with what previous novelists of the nineteenth century failed to engage with. Woolf observed - in a lecture given to the Cambridge Heretics Society in May 1924 - that: “no generation since the world began has known quite so much about character as our generation”. Woolf’s fiction tends to be psychological, for she experiments with the working of the psyche of her characters and the permanence of the past in the present beyond the reach of realism. Her fiction treats the complex networks of emotions and memories of which the character is the center of the narrative. This paper accordingly, addresses the philosophical background of the Stream of Consciousness and its use within fictional exertion and how the latter is deployed in Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway (1925) to show and uncover the anxieties vis-à-vis her thanatophobia, not only this, but also to express the anxieties of the Great War and the disillusionment towards the modern enterprise.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-09-04T02:35:44.287166,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/citation/,k23m4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ee6d66f41fc001b35c5b4/,5d6ee6d66f41fc001b35c5b4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k23m4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k23m4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k23m4,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no3.14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Georgia,"We interrogate the Georgia Supreme Court ruling in the 2002 capital murder trial of Brandon Smith to illustrate how “fair cross section” implementation in Georgia’s legal system was used to create case law that institutionalized discrimination against Hispanic participation in the jury process. By paying scrupulous attention to legal precedents specifically intended to widen inclusion under the equal protection clause, the Justices’ decision put into place one legal standard for Hispanic participation in the jury process and another standard for all other groups. Using critical race theory, we argue that legal precedents based on distorted perceptions of the composition of the Hispanic community in new destination states, common practices of jury forced balancing and sole reliance on decennial census numbers collided to create case law that unintentionally deprives Georgia’s Hispanics of equal protection under the law and may contribute to the disproportionate presence of racialized minorities and Hispanic youth in the criminal justice system.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-08-14T18:53:23.467333,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e22|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|International Migration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Crime, Law, and Deviance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Latina/o Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population",Stephanie A.

Such coverage is not only conveyed by the media and newspaper articles, but also by creating novels. As a result, the current study focuses on the concept of extremism. The hallmark of this study is to illustrate how such concept is ideologically embedded within a text. Thus, this study is confined to Don DeLillo's Falling man (2007). In this novel, DeLillo describes the trauma caused by 9/11 attacks. It is important to note that he  recruits his language to mirror Islam as an extreme religion.  To access the concept of extremism in this novel, the researchers will apply a critical stylistic approach. Therefore, the analysis will  depend heavily on the textual conceptual model that is represented by Jeffries (2010) to uncover the hidden ideologies related to extremism. The aims of current study is to investigate the way the linguistic meaning is used as a vehicle for constructing the ideology of extremism in the selected novel; in addition to identify the textual meaning that underlies extremism in the selected novel.  With the aid of critical stylistic tools, the researchers find out that DeLillo employs the use of certain linguistic choices in his novel.

However, as can be seen from the Cobb-Douglas production function, capital has the effect of increasing the marginal productivity of labor, and the effect is greater in industries with high labor share (labor-intensive industries). For this reason, if a Pigovian tax is imposed on capital-intensive industries, some capital will move to labor-intensive industries and workers' wages will increase. This paper uses a two-sector model to analyze the optimal Pigovian tax rate that will maximize the income of workers.

A classification of welfare regimes is carried out following a bottom-up approach and relying on the basis of the importance of welfare providers to satisfy social risks and promote well-being. Three traditional (e.g., state, market, family) and one alternative welfare provider (e.g., community) are considered. Data is collected through twenty semi-structured interviews in seven marginalised communities of Puerto Rico. The results show five configurations of intra-national welfare-mixes across the following welfare areas: housing, nourishment, health, education, maternity/paternity, disability, work-unemployment and older-age.

However, many low-income households are disadvantaged because existing public transit service does not provide them with sufficient access to destinations. Limited transit options, compounded with socioeconomic disadvantage, can result in transport poverty, preventing travel to important destinations, like employment opportunities. Given the growing gentrification of Canadian downtowns and the dispersion of poverty into Canadian suburbs, the time is right for a national accounting of those living in transport poverty, and the development of a national transport and land use strategy for alleviating the risks of accessibility deprivation. Accordingly, in this paper we measure and analyze vertical inequalities in access to employment in Canadian cities in order to estimate how many, where, and to what extent, Canadians are at risk of transport poverty. We make use of open transit network data and cutting edge accessibility measurement methods to generate comparative scores suitable for a national-scale analysis. We find that in aggregate, lower income neighbourhoods tend to have better levels of transit accessibility. But despite this overall positive outlook, there are still nearly one million low-income individuals living in urban areas with low transit accessibility. We summarize our findings by generating descriptive typologies for areas vulnerable to transport poverty which are then used to develop and recommend planning strategies to reduce inequalities.",TRUE,FALSE,accessibility|canada|geography|inequalities|policy|poverty|public transit|transit|transport|transportation|urban,2019-01-18T20:52:09.642085,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-18,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/citation/,ua2gj,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c423920154ce50018dd1423/,5c423920154ce50018dd1423,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ua2gj/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ua2gj/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ua2gj,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2018.11.018,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We find that place based factors predicting whether homeless individuals are victimized or the offender being homeless are largely consistent with one another. Out of 26 different crime attractors and generators, prior drug arrests, homeless shelters, and bus stops are the three biggest factors in predicting homeless related crime. We show how the RTM model can effectively forecast future homeless related crimes as well. This suggests that targeted spatial strategies can reduce both homeless offending and victimization risk. Given that the majority of homeless individuals are only intermittently homeless, place based strategies may be a more an effective way to limit risk than strategies that focus on individuals.

Internet access has relaxed geographic constraints on news use to create an- other possibility: exposure to political coverage from foreign media outlets. We study the frequency and form of foreign media exposure in the United States using individual-level web browsing data and a content analysis of the news this sample encountered. This reveals foreign media exposure is widespread and internationally-oriented. 85% of these individuals visited a foreign source. Foreign media accounted for 7% of all news website visits. In a within-subject analysis of over three million visits to foreign and domestic websites, individuals were substantially more likely to encounter foreign affairs coverage, and less likely to reach coverage of U.S. domestic politics, when visiting foreign news sources.

Assuming a simple model of tag assignment, we estimate the locations of parties and ideologies in a common space. We find that the recovered scale can be interpreted in familiar terms of 'left vs. right'. Estimated party positions correlate well with ratings of parties' positions from extant large-scale expert surveys, most strongly with ratings of general left-right ideology. Party position estimates also show high stability in a test-retest scenario. Our results demonstrate that a Wikipedia-based approach yields valid and reliable left-right scores comparable to scores obtained via conventional expert coding methods.

This paper identifies a fourth: transitional temporality. This approach is inspired by Polanyi's (1944) comparative analysis of the rate of change of economic transformation surrounding the respective commodification of land and labor. Following Polanyi, transitional temporality focuses not on the endpoints of social transformation (as in teleological approaches), nor on moments of transformation (as in eventful approaches), but on the potentially lengthy transitions between structures. While eventful temporality equates agency with the choices made by individuals during relatively rare events, transitional temporality identifies the capacity for agents to alter the rate of change and, in so doing, to prevent or bring about events. This approach recovers Polanyi's oft-ignored analysis of the state's role in modulating the rate of change and foregrounds the social costs of disruption and dislocation resulting from abrupt transitions.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-08-06T22:36:25.167682,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-06,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e37|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Theory|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology,Daniel Hirschman,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/citation/,tuz8p,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d486e6390489f001a4b436b/,5d486e6390489f001a4b436b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tuz8p/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tuz8p/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tuz8p,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The current literature is divided on this issue. One line of reasoning suggests that aid is likely to decrease violence by improving employment and prosperity, thereby making participation in conflict more costly. Another view cites evidence showing an association between aid projects and increased insurgent activity. Addressing this contradiction, we argue that different types of aid projects lead to different outcomes, as some projects foster an unequal distribution of benefits within communities. Our reasoning draws on qualitative accounts from conflict zones, recent research on how grievances associated with exclusion can foster civil war onset, and experimental findings regarding perceived inequity and punishment. Building on this scholarship, we use a recently developed event-matching methodology to offer insight from contemporary Afghani- stan. Aid projects that tend to exclude portions of the community yield more insurgent activity in their wake than more inclusive projects. These results shed light on why some aid projects reduce violence while others do not, emphasizing that efforts to ‘win hearts and minds’ can be a source of both contentment and contestation.",TRUE,FALSE,Afghanistan|development aid|event analysis|exclusion|grievances|insurgency|matching,2019-04-17T13:40:41.841159,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d90|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Asian Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d95|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Other International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/citation/,6ea2r,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/avntx/,avntx,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb69c40353c58001b9e7c3b/,5cb69c40353c58001b9e7c3b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ea2r/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ea2r/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ea2r,https://doi.org/10.1177/0022343318777566,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Therefore, it represents a unique skill consists of a mixture of several procedures that encourage the interaction with printed words for content and pleasure. The current study tries to  identify the impact of pleasure reading on enhancing writing achievement and reading comprehension. The study has employed different data collection methods, such as published research, articles, books, theses, and dissertations that are related to the study matter to provide answers to the following question: ‘ Do pleasure reading have an impact on enhancing writing achievement and reading comprehension?’. The results reveal that; pleasure reading has a positive impact on enhancing writing achievement and reading comprehension. In addition to, pleasure reading provides readers with entertainment, relaxation, comfort, as it also offers them a creative outlet and  means of escape, which, in turn, affect positively  effect on the writing performance.

Therefore, this study is an attempt to assess the status of the current level of organizational learning orientation among the Government-Linked Companies (GLCs) in Malaysia. This study collected primary data based on a set of questionnaire survey among 134 executives and managers of GLCs in Malaysia. The data were collected based on opinions of the ten factors of organizational learning practices by using the five-point Likert scale. The data were analysed using descriptive statistics. Further, the reliability of the data was tested using Cronbach’s alpha test, the validity of the data was tested by checking the normality test through skewness and kurtosis, and the consistency of the data was tested using factor analysis. On an average, 74.6% of the respondents agreed that they focus on these factors of organizational learning. The federal owned GLCs place more emphasis on organizational learning than the state owned GLCs. This study suggests improving the practices of organizational learning within the GLCs in Malaysia by emphasizing on the consideration that employee learning is an investment rather than an expense, employees should view themselves as partners in charting the direction of the organization, employees should not be afraid of critically reflecting on the shared assumptions about the ways of managing the organization, and by analyzing unsuccessful organizational endeavours and communicating the lessons learned widely among the employees.",TRUE,FALSE,government-linked companies|Malaysia|organizational learning|sustainable competitive advantage,2019-06-13T19:10:03.116702,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/citation/,yt4xd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/c748p/,c748p,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d020a0fe2124b001a3819fc/,5d020a0fe2124b001a3819fc,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/yt4xd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/yt4xd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/yt4xd,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Tom’s Midnight Garden is regarded by some literary critics as a nostalgic work concerned with the past rather than the present. Its protagonist Tom is sometimes considered as disconnected from the real world and living in the fantastic. This paper will argue that, quite the contrary, Tom’s Midnight Garden stands against disconnection, between the child and the adult, the fantastic and the real, and the past and the present. Tom’s Midnight Garden celebrates connection through the interrelation between the self and the other, through a fantastic world constantly interwoven with the real, and a past tightly tied to the present.

large part because the indiscriminate and heavy-handed tactics employed by the
country’s national police force, the Philippine Constabulary (PC), was a leading
factor driving support for the Huk movement. A key turning point in the campaign
came with the reform and reorganization of the PC, as a result of which the bulk of
the PC’s personnel were transferred into the Army, which was given the lead for the
COIN campaign. Although the idea of a military-led COIN campaign, with the police
in a supporting role, would appear to run counter to the assumptions that inspired
this volume, the example of the Philippine Constabulary illustrates the damage that
an ineffectual police agency can do in counterinsurgency and the lengths that a

That lack of safety was further complicated by any one individual's distance from privileged modes of contribution. In OSC, developers who were on key Contribution Teams and regularly added code to the codebase were valued more highly than those who contributed documentation, user experience research, or quality assurance work. David asked ""What if we made a survey that accounted for all of the ways that people make the web? Can we do it intersectionally? Can we do it the OSC way?""

Previous research suggests that there are significant class inequalities in how much time parents devote to this kind of developmental childcare in the United States. Yet, due in part to data limitations, prior research has not accounted for how class inequalities in family structure, assortative mating, and specialization between partners may exacerbate or ameliorate these gaps. We match parental respondents within the American Time Use Survey to generate synthetic parental dyads, which we use to estimate, in turn, the contributions of family structure, assortative mating, and specialization to class gaps in parental time spent in developmental care of children aged 0-6. We find some evidence that accounting for class differences in family structure widens income gaps in total parental time in developmental childcare of young children. Further, we show that assortative mating of parents further contributes to educational gaps in developmental childcare, while specialization between partners does not offset these wider class divides. While the net effect of these three processes on income-based gaps in childcare time is more modest, accounting for these three processes more than doubles education-based gaps in total parental developmental childcare as compared to maternal time alone. Our findings from this novel empirical approach provide a more holistic view of the extent and sources of inequality in parental time investments in young children’s cognitive and social development.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-01-23T03:01:41.007334,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-23,FALSE,NA,no,data / code provided by request; final replication package to be posted upon publication,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe3kc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe3kc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe3kc/citation/,xe3kc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe3kc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe3kc/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/74psf/,74psf,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe3kc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c47cd6f377632001b2c315f/,5c47cd6f377632001b2c315f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe3kc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe3kc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xe3kc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xe3kc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xe3kc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Both tools are sometimes used concurrently but the relation between children’s scores on the two tools is seldom investigated.

Methods: The Brazilian versions of ASQ-3 and ASQ:SE, known as the ASQ-BR and ASQ:SE-BR, were used for assessing 13,470 children ages one to four in public child daycare centres in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Four groups were defined according to children’s ages as one, two, three, and four year-olds. Correlation and multiple regression were employed to explore the relation between children’s scores on the ASQ-BR and the ASQ:SE-BR.

Results: Results indicated that the domain scores of ASQ-BR, including communication (r = -0.38 to -0.44), gross motor (r = -0.19 to -0.32), fine motor (r = -0.33 to -0.45), problem solving (r = -0.36 to -0.42), and personal-social (r = -0.38 to -0.51) were significantly correlated with ASQ:SE-BR scores. Regression analyses suggested that the communication and personal-social domains were significant predictors of social-emotional scores in most of the age groups.

Conclusion: General developmental assessment is suggested to be conducted with social-emotional screening. If the workload is heavy for administers to use both screeners concurrently, social-emotional screening is recommended for children who fail communication or personal-social domains on developmental screening tests.",TRUE,FALSE,development|developmental screening|social-emotional competence,2019-02-19T11:57:21.365003,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dab|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Clinical Psychology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejszf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejszf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejszf/citation/,ejszf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejszf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejszf/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/t9gj4/,t9gj4,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejszf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6abf8c1431270018a44ba9/,5c6abf8c1431270018a44ba9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejszf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejszf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ejszf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ejszf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ejszf,https://doi.org/10.26407/2018jrtdd.1.11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The analysis employs the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to co-integration in order to examine both the short and long run dynamics among the variables. Furthermore, the study uses the Granger procedure within the VAR framework to identify causality among the variables. The model used in this study is found to be sound, a diagnosis of the reliability of the model reached by testing normality, functional form, serial correlation, and heteroscedasticity, with stability of the model tested using a cumulative sum and cumulative sum square test, based on recursive regression residuals. The ARDL approach to co-integration reveals that real GDP growth positively influences energy consumption as well as significantly in both the short run and long run, while energy prices and technological innovation influence energy consumption negatively and significantly.

Annual gains in life expectancy in Scotland were slower in recent years than in the previous two decades. This analysis investigates how deaths in different age groups and from different causes have contributed to annual average change in life expectancy across two time periods: 2000-02 to 2012-14 and 2012-14 to 2015-17.  

Methods
Life expectancy at birth was calculated from death and population counts, disaggregated by five-year age-group and by underlying cause of death. Arriaga’s method of life expectancy decomposition was applied to produce estimates of the contribution of different age-groups and underlying causes to changes in life expectancy at birth  for the two periods.

Findings
Average annual life expectancy gains between 2012-14 to 2015-17  were markedly smaller than in the earlier period. Almost all age-groups saw worsening mortality trends, which deteriorated for most cause of death groups between 2012-14 and 2015-17. In particular, the previously observed substantial life expectancy gains due to reductions in mortality from circulatory causes, which most benefited those aged 55-84 years, more than halved. Mortality rates for those aged 30-54 years and 90+ years worsened, due in large part to increases in drug-related deaths, and dementia and Alzheimer’s disease respectively. 

Interpretation
Future research should seek to explain the changes in mortality trends for all age-groups and causes. More investigation is required to establish to what extent shortcomings in the social security system and public services may be contributing to the adverse trends and preventing mitigation of the impact of other contributing factors, such as influenza outbreaks.",TRUE,FALSE,decomposition|life expectancy|mortality|scotland,2019-07-15T13:31:03.181891,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Health Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/citation/,q8rme,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2c450f114a42001609218f/,5d2c450f114a42001609218f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/q8rme/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/q8rme/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/q8rme,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
tfesn,preprints,2019-10-31,2020-01-17,2019-10-31,NA,NA,Age Differences in Cognitive Personal Networks,"Background and Objectives
Previous research has found a negative association between network size and age, suggesting that people experience greater isolation from their personal networks with advancing age. In this paper, we evaluate age differences in how individuals perceive their social worlds to be structured, rather than focusing solely on network size.

Research Design &amp; Methods
A nationally represented sample of respondents (n=1,824) reported on their own ties to their close personal network members (i.e., ego-alter ties) as well as their perceptions of the acquaintanceship between those members (i.e., alter-alter ties). We used social network analysis to assess how the structure of these relationships vary by respondent age.

Results
There is a strong pattern of age-homophily with some inter-generational contact for both ego-to-alter and alter-to-alter ties. Egos perceive less age-heterophily among their alters than they perceive in their own ties. Net of the results for age-mixing, we find a positive association between ego age and personal network size and a negative association between average alter age and personal network size. Finally, we find that as alters’ ages increase, their expected degrees as perceived by ego decreases regardless of ego’s own age. 

Discussion &amp; Implication
Our results suggest that our social worlds shift in terms of size and structure across the life course. While contemporary close personal networks may grow slightly with age, our perceptions of older people having fewer network ties remains. We discuss these results in the context of recent findings that suggest aging uniformly insulates individuals from social contact from both structural and symbolic perspectives. Specifically, the findings here challenge the notion that network size declines with age suggesting that this result may be the product of perceptions and not reality.",TRUE,FALSE,aging|gerontology|social networks,2019-10-31T19:43:42.853967,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-31,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/citation/,tfesn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/eaxmj/,eaxmj,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dbb2680af84c3000ce6aeb7/,5dbb2680af84c3000ce6aeb7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tfesn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tfesn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tfesn,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This new emerging literature has already provoked a considerable amount of controversy, involving debates on the precise underlying mechanisms, the role of non-familial institutions and the possibility of reversed causality, as well as the quality of historical data. Using novel historical database of European family this paper reaffirms the hypothesis that historical family organization could be one of the intermediate factors associated with developmental and value disparities among European nations today pointed out in earlier scholarship. We show that countries starting out from more patriarchal family structures in the past exhibit more hierarchical gender relations, more collectivist mindsets, and lower levels of economic and human development in the present. These findings suggest that the criticism of the family role in comparative development may be premature, and that links between historical family organisation and developmental gradients merit further attention.",TRUE,FALSE,comparative development|family systems|family ties|gender inequality|historical persistence|individualism/collectivism|patriarchy,2019-10-04T16:03:03.873351,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|Arts and Humanities|History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/citation/,ad7qr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d96e896055eda000d3c0b48/,5d96e896055eda000d3c0b48,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ad7qr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ad7qr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ad7qr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, the actual trend in the 21st century has been the opposite. Knowledge spillovers have fuelled urbanisation and pulled job-seekers into large cities, increasing the gap to deprived rural areas. We argue that new assemblages of technologies and social practices, so-called ’online labour platforms’, have recently started to counter this trend. By providing effective formal and informal mechanisms of enforcing cooperation, these platforms for project-based remote knowledge work enable users to hire and find work across distance. In analysing data from a leading online labour platform in more than 3,000 urban and rural counties in the United States, we find that rural workers made disproportionate use of the online labour market. Rural counties also supplied, on average, higher skilled online work than urban areas did. However, many of the most deprived regions of the country did not participate in the online labour market at all.

Using three different data sources (retraction notices, expert interviews, survey of scientists), we show that sanctions for scientific misconduct operate within a cycle of visibility, in which sanctions are highly visible, while investigation and decision-making procedures remain mostly invisible. This corresponds to high levels of acceptance for sanctions in the scientific community, but rather low acceptance of the respective authorities.

Children from minority ethnic groups are, on average, 17% less likely to be admitted into their top-ranked secondary school, compared to white children. This gap is large even after controlling for socio-economic status and prior attainment. However, constraints on the length of preference lists mean that stated preferences may not be truthful, as parents may have incentives to strategise by excluding preferred schools. By accounting for strategic stated preferences and biased beliefs about chances of admission, this paper recovers parametric estimates of preference parameters and the degree of strategic selection. To examine the relative contribution of geographic sorting, strategies, and market design (mechanism and admission rules), the corrected revealed preference estimates are used to estimate expected welfare under three scenarios.

Meanwhile, parallel concerns about surveillance practices have already led to multiple successful regulatory efforts of surveillance technologies—many of which have algorithmic components. Here, we examine municipal surveillance regulation as offering lessons for algorithmic oversight. Taking the 2017 Seattle Surveillance Ordinance as our primary case study and surveying efforts across five other cities, we describe the features of existing surveillance regulation; including procedures for describing surveillance technologies in detail, processes for public engagement, and processes for establishing acceptable uses. Although these surveillance-focused laws were not intended to address algorithmic accountability, we find these considerations to be relevant to the law’s aim of surfacing disparate impacts of systems in use. We also find that in notable cases, government employees did not identify regulated algorithmic surveillance technologies as reliant on algorithmic or machine learning systems, highlighting a definitional gap that could hinder future efforts toward algorithmic regulation. We argue that (i) finer-grained distinctions between types of analytic and information systems in the language of law and policy, and (ii) risk assessment tools integrated into their implementation would both strengthen future regulatory efforts by rendering underlying algorithmic components more legible and accountable to political and community stakeholders.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-07-31T21:00:20.880820,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-31,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",Meg Young|Michael Katell|P.

A Comparison of White and Asian Americans’ Perception of Their Social Rank,"Asians are often viewed as the “model minority” group for assumptions about their high income and education level. Does this necessarily translate to higher self-esteem, social desirability, and self-perceived social rank for Asians? Building upon literature examining confidence, beauty, masculinity and the “model minority” stereotype, I use the General Social Survey (2016—2018) to study the relationships between attractiveness and perceived social rank for 124 Asian Americans and 3,038 White Americans. The attractiveness data was collected by the GSS rating respondents on their physical attractiveness. Social rank helps examine a general sense of perceived ranking in society that may not be explicitly expressed by socio-economic class. I propose that a high attractiveness rating positively affects the level of self-perceived ranking for Whites but not for Asians. I also control for sex, age, family income and education. The results of the regression support my hypothesis showing a statistically significant relationship between attractiveness and social rank for the White sample but not the Asian sample. However, the strongest predictor of self-perceived social rank was the level of family income. Therefore, the more money someone makes, the higher they self-reported their social rank for both Asians and Whites. Due to the limited sample size of Asians, further research including a larger group of Asian participants should be conducted to study the relationship between attractiveness and social rank.",TRUE,FALSE,Asian American|Race|Social Rank,2019-12-20T14:49:03.794488,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e32|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Asia and Asian America,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/citation/,6ajb5,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dfc09780236b8000c75b70d/,5dfc09780236b8000c75b70d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6ajb5/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6ajb5/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6ajb5,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A question of great theoretical and practical importance is how successful social institutions get established and spread across groups and societies. Here, using institutionalized punishment in small-scale societies as an example, we contrast two prominent mechanisms - selective imitation and self-interested design - with respect to their ability to converge to cooperative social institutions. While selective imitation has received a great deal of attention in studies of social and cultural evolution, the theoretical toolbox for studying self-interested design is limited. Recently Perry et al. (2018) expanded this toolbox by introducing a novel approach, which they called foresight, generalizing standard myopic best response for the case of individuals with a bounded ability to anticipate actions of their group-mates and care about future payoffs. Here we apply this approach to two general types of collective action – “us vs. nature” and “us vs. them” games. Our results show that foresight increases leaders’ willingness to punish free-riders. This, in turn, leads to increased production and the emergence of an effective institution for collective action. We also observed that largely similar outcomes can be achieved by selective imitation, as argued earlier. Foresight and selective imitation can interact synergistically leading to a faster convergence to an equilibrium. Our approach is applicable to many other types of social

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 1992 (UNFCCC) established a foundation for the development, application and diffusion of low-carbon technologies. Against this background, it is useful to analyse how the Paris Agreement 2015 deals with the subject of intellectual property, technology transfer, and climate change. While there was discussion of a number of options for intellectual property and climate change, the final Paris Agreement 2015 contains no text on intellectual property. There is text, though, on technology transfer. The Paris Agreement 2015 relies upon technology networks and alliances in order to promote the diffusion and dissemination of green technologies. In order to achieve technology transfer, there has been an effort to rely on a number of formal technology networks, alliances, and public–private partnerships—including the UNFCCC Climate Technology Centre and Network (CTCN); the World Intellectual Property Organization’s WIPO GREEN; Mission Innovation; the Breakthrough Energy Coalition; and the International Solar Alliance. There have been grand hopes and ambitions in respect of these collaborative and co-operative ventures. However, there have also been significant challenges in terms of funding, support, and operation. In a case of innovation policy pluralism, there also seems to be a significant level of overlap and duplication between the diverse international initiatives. There have been concerns about whether such technology networks are effective, efficient, adaptable, and accountable. There is a need to better align intellectual property, innovation policy, and technology transfer in order to achieve access to clean energy and climate justice under the framework of the Paris Agreement 2015. At a conceptual level, philosophical discussions about climate justice should be grounded in pragmatic considerations about intellectual property and technology transfer. An intellectual property mechanism is necessary to provide for research, development, and deployment of clean technologies. There is a need to ensure that the technology mechanism of the Paris Agreement 2015 can enable the research, development, and diffusion of clean technologies at a scale to address the global challenges of climate change.",TRUE,FALSE,climate finance|climate justice|climate law|innovation law|innovation policy|Intellectual Property|SOCARXIV,2019-02-19T11:54:08.338783,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c29|Law|International Trade Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c4e|Law|Intellectual Property Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c75|Law|Environmental Law,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/citation/,fxhvm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6b71078d5d98001b2e6865/,5c6b71078d5d98001b2e6865,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/fxhvm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/fxhvm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/fxhvm,https://doi.org/10.3390/laws8010007,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A survey was deployed via Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) on a randomly selected sample of the inner-Sydney population (n=409). We find that less than half of the participants worry about crime but that a sizable minority (13%) indicated that they have some worry about a category of crime every week of the year or more. Building on a recent conceptual advance Grey et al 2011), we differentiate between functional and dysfunctional fear of crime. We find that greater direct and indirect experience of victimization, believing one’s neighbourhood to be disorderly, and believing that collective efficacy is low all predict moving up the scale from no worry, to functional fear, to increasingly frequent dysfunctional fear. The findings suggest gender and age are largely unrelated to worry about crime, controlling for perceptions of community disorder, perceptions of collective efficacy, direct victimisation experience and indirect victimisation experience.

Admittedly, the Student Revolution spilled over into numerous fields. However, given space restrictions, only its cultural manifestations will be examined. It will be clear that at the root of Lodge’s students’ uprising lies an overpowering urge to break with the cultural heritage and with the academics upholding it. It will be equally clear, nonetheless, that these young activists’ faith in Marcuse’s political doctrine is unwelcome to conservative academics on the ground that it has diverse adverse effects on universities. Not only are politically oriented texts and discourses given precedence over traditional ones but also teachers and administrators are, at times, hindered from doing their duties.

This poses a challenge to the agencies and officers in charge of providing supervision—there are far more offenders in need of supervision than officers can reasonably attend to. This has forced agencies to be innovative in how they allocate their resources. Empirical evidence suggests resources should be allocated to high-risk offenders, but how can officers determine which offender is at a higher risk of misconduct at any given time? Traditionally, this has been achieved by relying on standardized risk assessment. But risk assessment has been criticized for making only marginally better-than-chance predictions of future misconduct. We offer a novel solution by integrating the Elo-rating system into the community supervision decision-making process. We show, by drawing on test data from the Pathways to Desistance Study, that combining the Elo-rating system with traditional risk assessment may lead to increases in predictive power. We then discuss how Elo-rating systems could be used by community supervision agencies to more effectively prioritize their caseloads.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-11-11T20:46:23.087820,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,Shahin Tasharrofi and J.C.

The study delves into how different scholars define modified proverbs (also sometimes referred to as deformed proverbs or anti-proverbs). The researcher will study a sample of adapted proverbs, regarding their new representation, and the effect of formal changes on their meaning, especially, when compared with their original structure. The study focuses on how the use of proverbs in narrative helps to flesh out the material and cultural life of 20th century Syria. This is done mostly by re-contextualizing the adapted proverbs. In so doing, the paper also discusses the different techniques of modification identified by various researchers. Then the focus moves on Alan Partington’s (1998, pp.126-8) four techniques for modifying phrases: substitution, insertion, abbreviation, and rephrasing. This is followed by an examination of sixteen modified proverbs, which are classified into four groups, each one representing the implementation of one of Partington’s four techniques. Finally, the study examines the semantic effect of applying these techniques.",TRUE,FALSE,modified|proverbs|semantics|Syrian|technique,2019-07-25T19:39:41.696329,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ax6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ax6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ax6/citation/,j9ax6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ax6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ax6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ax6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c70ec2e62c82a0018d8f392/,5c70ec2e62c82a0018d8f392,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ax6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ax6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/j9ax6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/j9ax6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/j9ax6,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no1.20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Baker's strategies for translating idioms (1992) formed the basis of the theoretical part of the study. The analytical part comprised Agatha Christie's novel, Appointment with Death (2001) and the translation of the novel by Ameen from English into Arabic. The study concentrated on the most dominant translation solutions when translating idioms from English into Arabic. A lack of equivalent idioms in the Arabic language was one of the outcomes of this study.

Innovative teams face the paradox of relying on experience to generate novelty.  We argue that forbidden triads, as conjunctures of dyadic experience, are the locations where successful novel combinations can be recognized and realized.  Prior scholarship has sidelined such network structural diversity with strong ties, and assumed that strong ties are mostly closed, and weak ties connect to diverse structural locations.  We use data on all recording sessions of more than a century of jazz to show that forbidden triad is the only consistent predictor of six measures of success that span the dualities of insiders and outsiders, and voice and trace. This network structure is also the only predictor of deep success: coinciding success in all four quadrants.

Past research offers three explanations of this phenomenon: 1. the economic explanation maintaining that parents contribute in order to supplement lagging public investments in education; 2. the opportunity hoarding explanation arguing parents contribute to secure educational advantages for their children; and 3. the civic engagement and social capital explanation that sees parent fundraising as an element of parents’ democratic participation in schools. This article considers the efficacy of these explanations in the case of parent fundraising in a Manhattan elementary school I call PSX. Applied to data collected through ethnographic research among PSX parents, the existing explanations provide an incomplete understanding of parent fundraising because they focus on the intentions and motivations of parents. A normative-institutional perspective provides additional explanatory leverage. Educational policy and normative expectations link parental fundraising and school quality. The money supplied by parents is an easy-to-read measure of a good school, and, by association, good parents.

Yet it is among the least researched topics in police science. Other types of investigations are performed using the same overall methodology, but within different jurisdictions and with different objectives.

The model is based on previous work by contemporary scholars and shares similarities with Fahsing’s ”6 Cs” circular model. Descriptive Business Process Model and Notation 2.0 (BPMN 2.0) is used to visualise the process. The objectives are to express, detail and visualise the various investigation actions and the relationship between them, thus contributing to a greater understanding of the investigation process. The model also provides a framework on which further research can be conducted in this multi-disciplinary field.",TRUE,FALSE,Crime|Forensics|Investigation|Process model,2019-05-28T13:56:05.806916,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c0d|Law|Criminal Procedure|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c72|Law|Civil Procedure|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Criminology and Criminal Justice|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|Forensic Science and Technology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/citation/,z4wma,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ced381f23fec40018e77085/,5ced381f23fec40018e77085,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/z4wma/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/z4wma/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/z4wma,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

With an increasingly large number of studies on urban place detection in language, behavior, pricing, and demography, recent critiques of longstanding regional science perspectives on place detection have focused on the arbitrariness and non-geographical nature of measures of best fit. In this paper, we develop new explicitly-geographical measures of cluster fit. These hybrid spatial-social measures, called geosilhouettes, are demonstrated to capture the ""core"" of geographical clusters in racial data on census blocks in Brooklyn neighborhoods. These new geosilhouettes are also useful in a variety of boundary analysis and outlier detection uses.

The previous studies have examined how semiotics could aid second language (L2) learner to learn concrete words. This study aims at investigating the effect of semiotics on learning abstract words. Fifty-five Arab learners of English as a foreign language (EFL) participated in the study and assigned into three groups. The first group was taught abstract words using semiotics. The second group was taught concrete words using semiotics. The third group was taught the same words using a traditional way, i.e., without semiotics. Results of the post-test indicated that participants in semiotics groups (either concrete or abstract) outscored the participants who did not use semiotics to learn new words. The study concluded that semiotics is a useful tool to enhance learning new words.

CMC researchers have suggested that emoticons behave much as do facial expressions in face-to-face interaction (e.g. Danet, Ruedenberg-Wright, &amp; Rosenbaum-Tamari, 1997; Rezabek &amp; Cochenour, 1998; Thompson &amp; Foulger, 1996). Some fMRI research suggests, however, that there is not a direct neural correspondence between emoticons and facial expressions, but that emoticons play an important role in determining the positive or negative valence of an utterance (Yuasa, Saito, &amp; Mukawa, 2011). Following the affective priming paradigm developed by Fazio, Sanbonmatsu, Powell, and Kardes (1986), this study explores the priming effects of emoticons vis-à-vis photographs of facial expression and emotional words on valence judgements of emotionally charged words. Significant main effects of age, prime valence, and target valence were found. There were also significant interactions between these three factors. Overall results suggest that younger and older participants have differing experiences of emoticons, with younger participants experiencing an effect of emoticons that is similar to the effect of facial expressions while older adults seem to experience emoticons in ways more like textual information or even just textual nonsense.",TRUE,FALSE,affect|CMC|computer mediated communication|emoticons|emotion|facial expression|FACS|psycholinguistics|sociolinguistics,2019-12-04T11:31:03.910676,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e00|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Psycholinguistics and Neurolinguistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfd|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e02|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Linguistics|Anthropological Linguistics and Sociolinguistics,Brittney O'Neill,2013,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/citation/,3zrf6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de6b62ae1e62f000b33ba31/,5de6b62ae1e62f000b33ba31,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3zrf6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3zrf6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3zrf6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There have been many attempts to propose a standard for textual resource interoperability, from the ubiquitous Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) format to more recent proposals like the Distributed Text Services (DTS) protocol. In this paper, we critically survey these attempts and introduce our proposal called SHINE, which aims to escape from TEI’s legacy and prioritize instead the ease for software developers to representation and exchange textual resources and their associated metadata. We do so by combining a hierarchical model of textual structure with a flexible metadata scheme in SHINE, and we continue to define and develop it based on user-centered and iterative design principles. Therefore, we argue that SHINE is a protocol for textual interoperability that successfully balances flexibility of resource representation, consistency across resource representation, and overall simplicity of implementation.",TRUE,FALSE,digital humanities|digital resources|digital texts|interoperability|metadata|TEI|textual resources,2019-10-16T18:28:42.234809,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-16,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccb|Arts and Humanities|Digital Humanities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|Cataloging and Metadata,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/citation/,qrmg8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bx8pw/,bx8pw,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da5a583a7bc73000bed7a68/,5da5a583a7bc73000bed7a68,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qrmg8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qrmg8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qrmg8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This has paralleled a greater push towards public engagement with science since the 1980s, with an emphasis on new forms of participation beyond scholarly audiences. Here, we take innovative dissemination to mean dissemination that goes beyond traditional venues for academic publishing in order to achieve more widespread research uptake and understanding.
In this paper, we present ten steps that researchers can take in order to embrace these practices in their research activities.

The purpose of this study was to understand the implementation of self-directed supports for individuals with IDD. Researchers interviewed state developmental disabilities administrators in 34 of 42 states that currently operate self-directed service options and used qualitative analysis to arrive at a thematic map of the strengths and challenges currently experienced by state administrators.

Biases in online listings' representativeness could impact different communities' access to housing search information, reinforcing traditional information segregation patterns through a digital divide. They could also circumscribe housing practitioners' and researchers' ability to draw broad market insights from listings to understand rental supply and affordability. This study examines millions of Craigslist rental listings across the US and finds that they spatially concentrate and over-represent whiter, wealthier, and better-educated communities. Other significant demographic differences exist in age, language, college enrollment, rent, poverty rate, and household size. Most cities' online housing markets are digitally segregated by race and class, and we discuss various implications for residential mobility, community legibility, gentrification, housing voucher utilization, and automated monitoring and analytics in the smart cities paradigm. While Craigslist contains valuable crowdsourced data to better understand affordability and available rental supply in real-time, it does not evenly represent all market segments. The Internet promises information democratization, and online listings can reduce housing search costs and increase choice sets. However, technology access/preferences and information channel segregation can concentrate such information-broadcasting benefits  in already-advantaged communities, reproducing traditional inequalities and reinforcing residential sorting and segregation dynamics. Technology platforms like Craigslist construct new institutions with the power to shape spatial economies, human interactions, and planners' ability to monitor and respond to urban challenges.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|city planning|community|craigslist|critical GIS|demographics|digital divide|displacement|econometrics|gentrification|geospatial|GIS|housing|housing market|housing policy|housing search|housing supply|housing vouchers|inequality|information|neighborhood|regional planning|rental housing|residential mobility|residential sorting|section 8|segregation|smart cities|smart city|spatial econometrics|technology|urban economics|urban planning,2019-07-13T19:17:21.750183,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c5a|Law|Housing Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d88|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Geographic Information Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Regional Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dd4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Library and Information Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Urban Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76deb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76ded|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Science and Technology Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class",Geoff Boeing,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/citation/,pqgw7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/jmkxa/,jmkxa,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2a1e1c1c5b4a001c9fe8b2/,5d2a1e1c1c5b4a001c9fe8b2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/pqgw7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/pqgw7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/pqgw7,https://doi.org/10.1177/0308518X19869678,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The background of learning theories, assessment types, and self-assessment literature provides a foundation for further discussion of the appropriate use of rubrics, including the prioritization of criterion, the quality of scoring, the impact of organizational features on scoring, the influence of bias, and the best application of rubric assessment. Relevant points for further study are identified, such as differentiation in research between generalized analytical rating systems and rubric assessment with specific, empirical criterion. The contradictory research regarding the advantages and disadvantages of rubric assessment in comparison with holistic assessment are of particular and crucial interest for global pedagogy. Many of the reviewed Western articles excluded Asian perspectives- except for China- and thus present a limited understanding of social and educational compatibility with new assessments and rubric assessments in particular. The discussion identifies patterns and points of contention and seeks to explore viewpoints rather than limit the scope of inquiry and consideration thus noting that relevant literature suggests that with appropriate teacher training, teachers may appropriately use rubrics as a formative assessment tool for writing in Asia and the Middle East.",TRUE,FALSE,Asia|education|formative assessment|Middle East|professional development|rater|rubric|scoring|summative assessment,2019-10-11T16:40:01.895452,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/citation/,p9tjc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da00526a7bc73000cea60f3/,5da00526a7bc73000cea60f3,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p9tjc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p9tjc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p9tjc,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This study developed a new model of fraud risk by integrating new elements into a fraud triangle theory. This study simultaneously analyzed religiosity and the three elements of fraud risk factors of employee fraud committed by low and mid-level public officials. The data collected from 120 enforcement officers indicated that religiosity is negatively related to employee fraud. By contrast, all the three elements of fraud triangle theory, namely, pressure, opportunity, and rationalization, are positively related to employee fraud. These results imply that strong religiosity is crucial to mitigate employee fraud. To minimize employee fraud, the opportunity to commit such fraud should be reduced through strong internal control, reduction of negative rationalization, and employee financial pressure. This study contributes to the literature by introducing a new model on employee-fraud occurrence that is not extensively discussed, particularly in the context of local authority in developing countries.",TRUE,FALSE,Local authority; Religiosity; Fraud Triangle; Employees fraud,2019-06-13T10:31:44.869049,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-13,FALSE,NA,no,NA,NA,no,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Legal Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Terrorism Studies",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/citation/,wcyg4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/azk7x/,azk7x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0221e635988f001bde7a8e/,5d0221e635988f001bde7a8e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wcyg4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wcyg4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wcyg4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

More specifically yet, it is concerned with examining the intricate correlation between Moroccan English Language Teachers’ (ELT) attitudes and practices with respect to the way they understand and apply FA by means of WCF on students’ written productions. To that end, the study seeks to investigate this issue in the light of the following guiding questions: What beliefs do Moroccan ELT teachers hold about FA and WCF? How do these teachers provide WCF to their students during the writing lesson? To address these questions, we have opted for a mixed method approach that includes questionnaires for 110 teachers, document analysis of 30 writing productions and a follow- up semi-structured interviews with teachers. Date has been interpreted through an Explanatory Sequential Design. Inspired by Lee‘s (2009) analytical model and Perumanathan (2014) study, major findings have been presented regarding mismatches. These findings have revealed strong mismatches between teachers espoused beliefs concerning WCF, as a formative assessment tool, and their actual classroom practices. Finally, the study sets some implications for teachers, supervisors underlining the implementation of WCF in classroom practices.",TRUE,FALSE,Beliefs|feedback|formative assessment|mismatch|writing,2019-01-05T04:49:46.501181,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/citation/,6j5n7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2bf0800e8efd0017d09853/,5c2bf0800e8efd0017d09853,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6j5n7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6j5n7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6j5n7,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, while ubicomp and IoT are changing and shaping children’s digital and technological landscape, not much is known about how children perceive these omnipresent and concealed forms of digital technology. This qualitatively oriented paper explores 3‐ to 6‐year‐old Finnish children’s perceptions of ubicomp and IoT via interviews and a design task. Initially, the children were skeptical toward the idea that tangible objects, such as toys, could be computer and/or Internet enabled. However, these perceptions were subject to change when children were introduced to a scientific conception of what computers and the Internet are and asked to apply their knowledge to a technological design task.

Compared to most previous studies that employ organization-centric networks where ties stand for hyperlinks, collaborations, or coalitions, the new approach projects organization-public relationships and public-public relationships onto interorganizational ties. By doing so, it 1) brings publics back into networked public relations research; 2) presents organizations and publics—the two most important subjects of public relations research—equally in the same network, 3) drives literature further away from a dyadic view of relationship management, and 4) constitutes one of the first techniques that can analyze direct and timely consequences of organization-public relationships in the network ecology. To demonstrate the new approach, the network of publics overlap is introduced and applied to US-based LGBTQ advocacy groups. The essay also discusses the theoretical inquiries needed to further dual-projection networks, and invites scholars to create novel ways to incorporate publics into their network studies using dual projection.",TRUE,FALSE,dual projection|network ecology|public-public relationships|public relations|publics|social networks,2019-03-01T12:46:22.171334,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-01,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e10|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Public Relations and Advertising|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0d|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e15|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Communication|Organizational Communication,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/citation/,f9cxs,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/3rfby/,3rfby,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c789dcf82a3950018cf6c18/,5c789dcf82a3950018cf6c18,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/f9cxs/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/f9cxs/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/f9cxs,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pubrev.2019.03.004,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Applying two complementary empirical strategies to data on 10,125 adults interviewed by the World Health Organisation's Survey of Global Ageing and Adult Health (WHO-SAGE), we document and standardize gaps in self-reported mental health between the dominant social group (higher caste Hindus) and two marginalized social groups (Scheduled Castes and Muslims).

epidemic spread. In this work, we perform a systematic study with a goal to device a methodology for using the huge amount of
survey data available to understand customer behaviour from a more mathematical and quantitative perspective. We perform
an unsupervised natural language processing based analysis of the responses of a recent survey focusing on referral marketing
to correlate the customers’ psychology with transitional dynamics, and investigate some major determinants that regulate the
diffusion of a campaign. In addition to natural language processing for topic modeling, detailed differential equation based
analysis and graph theoretical treatment, experiments have been performed for generation of a recommendation network to
understand the diffusion dynamics in homogeneous as well as heterogeneous population. A complete mathematical treatment
with analysis over real social networks can help us to determine key customer motivations and their impacts on a marketing
strategy, which are important to ensure an effective spread of a designed marketing campaign. Pointing out possibilities of
extending these studies to game theoretic modeling, we prescribe a new quantitative framework that can find its application to
all areas of social dynamics, beyond the field of marketing.",TRUE,FALSE,Bifurcation|Digital epidemiology|Graph theory|Human behavior modeling|Nonlinear Dynamics|Referral marketing|Social networks|Tipping point,2019-09-12T14:38:49.273436,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d9f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Quantitative Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Behavioral Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology",Sayantari Ghosh,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/citation/,6spnr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7a04f4fcbf44001a445b4d/,5d7a04f4fcbf44001a445b4d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6spnr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6spnr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6spnr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

While the literature relates legislature size to representation and government expenditure, its implications for welfare remain understudied. In this paper, we investigate the effects of legislature size on welfare, exploiting exogenous changes in city-council size in Brazil between 2005 and 2008. We show that adding a legislator improves education and health care. However, the results prove true for the services that are believed to be highly salient to voters, are easiest to claim credit for, and are easy to provide. In this sense, education quality and preventive health care remain unaffected while infant mortality and primary school enrollment significantly improve. To investigate the mechanism, we surveyed former councilors and analyzed 346,553 bills proposed by municipalities in the period.

Few studies, however, investigate the role and impact of such online platforms on planning outcomes. We evaluate the impact of participant input via a public participation geographic information system (PPGIS), a platform to suggest the placement of new bike share stations in New York City (NY) and Chicago (IL). We conducted 2 analyses to evaluate how close planners built new bike share stations to those suggested on PPGIS platforms. According to our proximity analysis, only a small percentage of built stations were within 100 feet (30 m) of suggested stations, but our geospatial analysis showed a substantial clustering of suggested and built stations in both cities that was not likely due to random distribution. We found that the PPGIS platforms have great promise for creating genuine co-production of planning knowledge and insights and that system planners did take account of the suggestions offered online. We did not, however, interview planners in either system, and both cities may be atypical, as is bike share planning; moreover, multiple factors influence where bike stations can be located, so not all suggested stations could be built.

Takeaway for practice: Planners can use PPGIS and similar platforms to help stakeholders learn by doing and to increase their own local knowledge to improve planning outcomes. Planners should work to develop better online participatory systems and to allow stakeholders to provide more and better data, continuing to evaluate PPGIS efforts to improve the transparency and legitimacy of online public involvement processes.",TRUE,FALSE,bike share|co-production|crowdsourcing|PPGIS,2019-01-12T21:42:27.854191,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/citation/,mtnza,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3a4e36e8da0e001a56b2ab/,5c3a4e36e8da0e001a56b2ab,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mtnza/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mtnza/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mtnza,https://doi.org/10.1080/01944363.2018.1476174,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Assessment and recognition in academic recruitment,"How do academics become professors? This paper considers the making of ‘professor’ as a subject position through which academics are acknowledged in both organizational contexts and disciplinary fields. The paper examines social processes of recognition in 145 appointment procedures for professorships in the discipline of history at sixteen German universities between 1950 and 1985. Based on an analysis of over 1500 documents from archived appointment records, I investigate how academics are acknowledged as professorial in appointment procedures. The procedures invoked both (1) processes of judgement, in which worth and qualities are attributed to candidates, and (2) processes of legitimation, in which said judgements are stabilized and made acceptable. Using insights from the sociology of valuation and evaluation, this paper sheds light on the fundamental processes of recognition and valorization in academia. The findings contribute to the sociology of scientific knowledge and science and technology studies, which have concentrated on academic recognition in the realm of research, but paid less attention to such recognition in organizational contexts.

Résumé : Comment les populations indigènes d’Amazonie se représentent-elles les êtres du monde ? En d’autres termes, quelle est leur ontologie ? La plus récente réponse à cette question passe par la réhabilitation d’un concept ancien : l’animisme. Ce modèle de la pensée amazonienne s’est imposé dans les deux dernières décennies, et il occupe aujourd’hui une position hégémonique. Je soutiens ici que le modèle animiste de la pensée amazonienne pose de nombreux problèmes : il rend mal compte des données ethnographiques et échoue à identifier le propre de la pensée amazonienne. Si l’ontologie amazonienne n’est pas animiste, qu’est-elle alors ? Je propose un nouveau modèle selon lequel l’ontologie amazonienne est fondamentalement non essentialiste. Deux types de preuves viennent corroborer cette proposition : je propose d’abord une brève revue de la littérature ethnographique amazoniste, puis présente des données expérimentales que j’ai récemment collectées chez les Huni Kuin du Haut-Purus (Amazonie péruvienne). Je conclus en posant quelques-uns des jalons d’une vaste entreprise de comparaison des ontologies à travers le monde.

Title: « Amazonian ontology: animism or non-essentialism? »
Abstract: How do indigenous Amazonian people conceive of the beings of the world? In other words, what is their ontology? The most recent response to this question consists in revamping an old concept: animism. Within the last two decades, this model of Amazonian thought has become increasingly influential. I contend that the animistic model of Amazonian thought is problematic in many respects: it does not do justice to ethnographic data and fails to pinpoint the uniqueness of Amazonian thought. If the Amazonian ontology cannot be characterized as animistic, what is it then? I put forth a new model according to which the Amazonian ontology is fundamentally non essentialist. Two strands of evidence corroborate this claim: first, I briefly review some of the Amazonianist ethnographic literature, and next present experimental data I recently collected among the Huni Kuin of the Upper Purus River (Peruvian Amazon). In conclusion, I pave the way for a broader endeavor of comparison of ontologies across the world.

But, how do people “bind” otherwise discrete elements as a single element? In cognitive neuroscience and the philosophy of mind, this is known as the “binding problem.” Sociologists can learn from research on binding, as it deepens our understanding of cultural objects, learning, and social change. Binding is the process by which a material “token” is assimilated into (or expands the boundaries of) a cognitive “type,” or resists such typification thereby leading to the formation of a new cognitive “type.” Cultural objects are simultaneously types and tokens, and the interplay between them results in a fundamental cultural instability. “Binding” is an attempt to stabilize meaning in two ways: the first, innovating, is implicated in the emergence of a cultural object, and the second, indexicalizing, in its maintenance and extension. However, even the process of indexicalizing a well established type—i.e., the proliferation of tokens—provides the material fodder from which to innovate new types.

It does so by discovering generative points of contact between two sets of methods that are also typically viewed as antithetical: data science and critique. Cultural analytics is an emerging field wherein humanist scholars leverage the increasing availability of large digital corpora and the affordances of new computational tools. This allows them to study, for example, semantic and narratological patterns in the English-language novel at the scale of centuries and across tens-of-thousands of texts. Cultural analytics is a fast-growing field, with scholars taking on an expanding array of topics, including genre and cultural prestige. Yet there is one topic that remains relatively understudied: race and racial difference. The reasons for this elision are not hard to grasp. Computational methods demand the quantification of one's objects of study. It's likely easier to accept measuring a novel's popularity by sales figures or classifying its genre by diction than labeling it according to discrete racial identifiers.

examining the prospects for bilateral cooperation in Asia. Although peacetime
foreign policy collaboration between major powers is a rarity, China’s rapid rise in
the international system appears to have forced the United States and India into
unprecedentedly close consultation on regional security issues. Will this consultation
mature into active cooperation? To answer this question, this introductory essay first
examines the concept of strategic partnerships—a nebulous type of political
relationship that have proliferated since the end of the Cold War. It then highlights
the obstacles to peacetime cooperation between major powers in other regions of the world. Following this, attention turns to the articles in this special issue which
examine the history of Indo-U.S. cooperation in various sub-regions of Asia.
Collectively, these pieces challenge misperceptions and misunderstandings of each
country’s policies and past behavior, as well as identify the differing understandings
of both the bilateral relationship and the region held by each party. Taken together,
these articles provide a clearer sense of the geopolitical scope and depth, as well as
the important limitations, of the Indo-U.S. strategic partnership. The article
concludes by identifying the key insights that come from this collection and offers
some thoughts the overall trajectory of U.S.-India relations.",TRUE,FALSE,Asia|cooperation|India|Strategic partnership|United States,2019-12-23T17:28:23.108644,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|International Relations,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jeyct/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jeyct/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jeyct/citation/,jeyct,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jeyct/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jeyct/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jeyct/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e0061e3fad251000b71bff5/,5e0061e3fad251000b71bff5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jeyct/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jeyct/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jeyct/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jeyct/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jeyct,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Although in most cases they are earmarked as retracted in bibliographic databases and in the electronic version of journals, they often remain cited a long time after the retraction notice is published. The misconduct case of Jan Hendrik Schön is a well know example.

The game of football (soccer) provides a wealth of real world data with which to quantify managers' use of personal and social information in selecting team formations. I analyse a 5-year dataset of all games (n=9127, 2012-2017) in the five top European leagues (English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish La Liga, French Ligue 1 and Italian Serie A) to quantify the extent to which a manager's initial match formation is guided by their personal past use or success with that formation, or other managers' use or success with that formation. I focus in particular on the use of the 4231 formation, which was the dominant formation at the start of this period but showed a gradual decline in use over time. I find that, as predicted, a manager's choice of whether to use 4231 or not is influenced by both their recent use of 4231 (personal information) and the use of 4231 in the entire population of managers in that division (social information). Contrary to expectations, managers appeared to rely more on personal than social information, although this estimate was highly variable across managers and divisions. Serie A managers, in particular, showed a much stronger use of personal information, likely due to the rarity of 4231 in that division. Finally, there did not appear to be an adaptive tradeoff between social and personal information use, with the relative reliance on each failing to predict managerial success.",TRUE,FALSE,cultural evolution|football|social learning|sport,2019-11-22T19:19:01.696996,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f7c698300375c76da2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Social Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sports Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e51|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Culture",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/citation/,wrx9f,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/pg9cz/,pg9cz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd7d64e6fc769000ad4ca76/,5dd7d64e6fc769000ad4ca76,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wrx9f/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wrx9f/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wrx9f,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, there is a need to develop a measure that exhibits the multidimensional nature of the welfare state, instead of focusing on the social spending dimension. Segura-Ubiergo (The political economy of the welfare state in Latin America: globalization, democracy and development. Cambridge University Press, New York, 2007) constructed a welfare effort index (WEI) to facilitate understand the relative degrees of welfare state development among Latin American countries. The WEI focuses mainly on social spending and ignores the other dimensions of welfare. Based on a comparative analysis of 17 Latin American countries and following the methodology of Segura-Ubiergo, a new index that aims at enriching the WEI was constructed. The new index is multidimensional in that it has eight indicators relating to three dimensions of welfare: social spending, coverage of welfare programs and outcome of welfare institutions. Principal component analysis was used for reducing the indicators into three indexes that represent three proposed dimensions of welfare. The combination of these three indexes gives the multidimensional welfare index. The results of the index account for more than 75 % of the data variance.",TRUE,FALSE,caribbean|composite indicator|coverage|latin america|methodology|principal component analysis|social policy|social protection|welfare|welfare state,2019-02-02T04:40:01.158685,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-02,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Latin American Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Models and Methods|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Welfare",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc786/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc786/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc786/citation/,vc786,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc786/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc786/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/5t732/,5t732,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc786/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c54e0c3e16f550019871899/,5c54e0c3e16f550019871899,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc786/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc786/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vc786/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vc786/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vc786,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-013-0549-7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

They work to create favorable conditions to market their services. At the same time, they are constrained by external political forces, including political parties, social movements, and public opinion. This article reviews what we know about the reciprocal relationship between the private corrections industry and politics. 
Policy Implications: The review of extant research yields several implications for practitioners and policymakers. First, correctional privatization is not uniformly accepted, a fact that presents challenges for the industry and opportunities for critics.

Readability is a practical consideration when making decisions on materials to match a text with target readers’ proficiency.  However, few studies have compared the readability levels of teaching and testing materials in terms of the difficulty of passages.  The present study, therefore, aims to explore the readability levels and the linguistic characteristics of reading passages in English textbooks and the Thai National Education English Test based on three readability formulas and eight aspects of linguistic characteristics as provided by the Coh-Metrix computational tool.  Two sets of corpora were generated and analyzed by using Coh-Metrix as the main instrument.  The obtained data from the reading passages compiled in the English textbooks and the Thai national education English test were compared to explore the significant differences.  The results revealed a mismatch in the readability levels and linguistic characteristics.  Passages from the English textbooks are easier than those used in the English test.  It is recommended that all stakeholders in both teaching and testing administration be aware of the different levels of readability between reading passages.  More considerations should be made when preparing the teaching and testing materials because a suitable difficulty level will ensure that students receive the most benefit from the materials.

Patterns in the Public Acceptance of Protest, 1985 - 2006","A social movement society refers to a society in which protest is a standard, institutionalized feature of the political landscape. Is the U.S. steadily becoming such a society? Whereas other empirical tests of the movement society thesis have focused on political tactics and individual participation in protest, we point to the public’s attitudes as another indicator of the movement society. Using General Social Survey data, we find that the public has grown more accepting of protest with time. In addition, using indicators of social location, social engagement, and political engagement as predictors, we find that while these factors help explain support for protest, their effects vary depending on the type of protest in question. Age, education, gender, income, employment status, and political interest all affect the acceptance of public meetings and demonstrations; however, the effect of income is reversed when it comes to the acceptance of a nationwide strike. Lastly, an age-period-cohort analysis finds evidence that a period effect is greater than a cohort effect in changing attitudes over time. Taken together, these findings support the claim that broad, societal-level influences have contributed to the public acceptance of protest, which is suggestive of a social movement society. Yet while the U.S. may constitute a social movement society, it is one with clear boundaries: individuals do support protest, but only to the extent that it does not disrupt the material advantages associated with their social location.",TRUE,FALSE,age-period-cohort analysis|protest|public opinion|social movement society,2019-06-06T19:26:03.742061,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-06,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/citation/,79k3u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf5644a0966240018d85fc2/,5cf5644a0966240018d85fc2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/79k3u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/79k3u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/79k3u,https://doi.org/10.1080/00380237.2019.1624233,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The subjects of this study were 100 students from different backgrounds who had been exposed to the English language for a significant period of time. They were asked to complete a questionnaire consisting of a test on the use of politically correct English vocabularies and terms, and a survey of their opinions and attitudes towards the use of English with political correctness. Five of the respondents were interviewed about their attitudes. The findings reveal that students are able to identify certain politically correct words and terms regardless of the categories. Respondents also have positive attitudes and they consider this type of language as a formal and respectful language. They also suggest that this type of language is important and it should be implemented in workplaces and certain fields. However, there are few limitations of English with political correctness as it is considered unclear and sometimes it is overused. Moreover, there is no institution or academic initiative to standardize the use of English with political correctness. The findings could be useful to develop the use of English with political correctness in society, to objectify politically correct language, and to promote the importance of politically correct language, which is viewed as formal and respectful language that can reduce conflicts in international communications.",TRUE,FALSE,inclusive language|political correctness|racism|sexism,2019-01-05T04:54:21.961797,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-05,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwxcy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwxcy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwxcy/citation/,bwxcy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwxcy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwxcy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwxcy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c309e0e8efd0016cd5811/,5c2c309e0e8efd0016cd5811,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwxcy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwxcy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bwxcy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bwxcy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bwxcy,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.33,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Prior research, from a range of contexts, has also yielded inconsistent results. We contribute to this debate by using harmonized data and methods to examine the effects of exposure to conflict on preferred and observed fertility outcomes across a spatially and temporally extensive population. We use high-resolution georeferenced data from 25 sub-Saharan African countries, combining records of violent events from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Dataset with data on fertility goals and outcomes from the Demographic and Health Surveys (n=368,765 women aged 15-49 years). We estimate a series of linear and logistic regression models to assess the effects of exposure to conflict events on ideal family size and the probability of childbearing within the 12 months prior to the interview. We find that, on average, exposure to armed conflict leads to modest reductions in both respondents’ preferred family size and their probability of recent childbearing. Many of these effects are heterogeneous between demographic groups and across contexts, which suggests systematic differences in women’s vulnerability or preferred responses to armed conflict. Additional analyses suggest that conflict-related fertility declines may be driven by delays or reductions in marriage. These results contribute new evidence about the demographic effects of conflict and their underlying mechanisms, and broadly underline the importance of studying the many second-order effects of organized violence on vulnerable populations.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-06-16T20:48:22.445693,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-16,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e42|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Peace, War, and Social Conflict",Brian Thiede|Matthew Hancock|Ahmed Kodouda|and James Piazza,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/citation/,4c9b2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d06a4007b8c4d001a9d04d9/,5d06a4007b8c4d001a9d04d9,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4c9b2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4c9b2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4c9b2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

j7h8t,preprints,2019-04-23,2020-07-16,2019-04-23,NA,NA,Becoming a steward of data science,"This article introduces the concept of the steward: the individual to whom the public, and other practitioners, can entrust the integrity of their field. The concept will be defined, particularly with respect to what about stewardship can be demonstrated by the practitioner so that others – including other stewards – can recognize this professional identity. Stewardship is an important aspect of professionalism, and although data science is a very new profession, its growth in terms of the number of practitioners should also include growth in the commitment to integrity in practice. Although an undergraduate program may seem early to begin understanding what this commitment means, and how to generate evidence of that commitment for yourself, those with a strong understanding of stewardship and how to recognize it will be better able to select jobs in contexts where this commitment to integrity is nurtured and valued. Learning about stewardship engages students in taking responsibility for their role in the profession, and so taking responsibility for the profession and the professional community.

Against this background, policymakers often call for more diversity in the teacher workforce, assuming that migrant students might benefit from being taught by a migrant teacher. Despite the popularity of this claim, there is almost no research-based rationale for increasing the diversity of teachers in Europe. This paper is a step to fill this research gap for Germany. We aim to assess whether migrant teachers reduce ethnic educational disadvantages. Our analyses are based on the ‘IQB National Assessment Study on Languages 2008/2009’, a nationally representative large-scale assessment study of ninth-graders that provides information on migration status of both students and teachers. Our dependent variables are objective German language competence scores and teacher-assigned grades. Results run contrary to the widely held expectations.

To do so, Indonesian tertiary universities accommodate and foster this competence using academic writing course. The study, therefore, sought to look into: 1. what undergraduate EFL students’ perceptions of the importance of academic writing to their current study and future career, 2. what the students’ perceptions of the difficulties of academic writing, 3. what the students’ attitudes towards their previous and future academic writing courses. The present study investigates students’ needs emerging in academic writing during classroom practices to gain insightful and profound perspectives for forthcoming needs of the course. Data were collected through a five scaled questionnaire of need analysis distributed to thirty-four EFL students from a private university, and a focus group interview involving nine participants. Results indicate 61% (Mdifficulties=3.05) of students faced difficulties in both general skills and language problems of academic writing and a new course was expected to provide moves/steps for writing the sections in a research article.

We conjecture that the answer depends on whether credible information about individuals’ toughness is available. When people send credible signs and signals of their toughness disputes may be solved without violence. We use a laboratory experiment in which subjects create information about their toughness and decide whether to take others’ resources and resist in case others’ attempt to take theirs. Subjects perform a potentially painful but safe physical exercise to create information and to determine who wins and loses fights. This, realistically, ranks subjects according to their toughness and implicates toughness, a quality important in real conflict, in fighting.

When new methodological tools like social media (SM) research are developed, differing norms of what constitutes ethically responsible research clash. Mining data from SM platforms such as Facebook, is of particular interest to scholars in the research evaluation field and the availability of this data has contributed to the rapid development of the field over recent years. In the research evaluation field, there has been no discussion about the ethical considerations associated with using data from academic social media platforms. Instead, SM platforms are widely considered a general source of seemingly publicly available data, and therefore free for public use. Recent behaviours of researchers and their affiliated entrepreneurial partners such as Cambridge Analytica highlight that despite dominant thought to the contrary, the use of SM data is not ethically-free, nor should it be free from ethical scrutiny. Unfortunately, the nature of SM data is not contingent with traditional notions of consent, privacy, risk to participants, nor the freedom to withdraw. 
This paper reports uses data from UK higher education stake holders which consider the ethical boundaries of SM data, thereby focusing on how these academic governing bodies are failing to consistently promote a community-wide norm relating to the used of SM data. This leads to the application of ad hoc ethical definitions, or the promotion of the ability of researchers to apply a sense of “personal ethics” about SM use, that is not necessarily in line with the nature of SM data. As such, this paper offers a number of recommendations for the academic community to reflect on the ethical dimensions associated with responsible research behaviour relative to the use of SM data.",TRUE,FALSE,personal ethics|Publishing ethics|responsible reserach behaviour|social media data,2019-02-07T20:16:47.277846,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-07,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msyb6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msyb6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msyb6/citation/,msyb6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msyb6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msyb6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msyb6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5af5c176653c001b2a276d/,5c5af5c176653c001b2a276d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msyb6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msyb6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/msyb6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/msyb6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/msyb6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, fusion energy is characterized by a “development divide” between the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) consortium members and the non-ITER “Global South” states. It is beset with problems, which can be divided into geopolitical, geo-economic, geo-sociocultural, and geo-technological (GEO-PEST). Geopolitical problems include cooperation on fusion energy development between ITER members (of the Global North) and the Global South on fusion development. Geo-economic problems include the cost of funding ITER versus newly emerging private-sector fusion companies. Geo-sociocultural problems include the requirement to maintain the peacebuilding tradition of nuclear energy (embodied by the Cold War-era “Atoms for Peace” initiative), as well as public perceptions of radiation. Geo-technological problems include tokamak lock-in, fuel type, the viability of “compact reactors,” and disruptive technology events.

From the process, three themes were revealed and are as follows: (1) in a suspended reality, (2) bargaining with time, and (3) restless in a resting place. These themes are the overarching patterns of the lives of the co-researchers. Further reflection from these themes generated the essence of the co-researchers lives, encapsulated by the phrase “Hope within Hopelessness”. 
Insights from the study suggest that the co-researchers continue to have a glimmer of hope even though the overall context of their experience is that of hopelessness since they seem to have attributed DNR with imminent death.

In practice, fluid processes have been difficult to experimentally quantify. Active self-concepts theoretically respond to social contexts while stable self-concepts are context-independent. Such fluctuations in ‘typical’ adults have rarely been reported. Self-concept research has broad implications; inducing and quantifying active fluctuations is long-sought-after in social psychology. However, since their inception, self-concepts were studied using bicultural participants (e.g., cultural priming experiments) and characterized in psychiatric patients (e.g., ‘fragmented self’). By increasing methodological saliency and ecological validity of popular methods, three studies tested an adapted scale and social interaction priming procedure for differentiating between active and stable self-concepts. Psychometrics, reproducibility and clinical relevance are compared to a common measure of bicultural self-concept fluidity using optimized statistics. Pre-Study controls (N=42) characterize repetition effects. Study 1: Active self-concepts are suppressed in convenience sample of 62 W.E.I.R.D. students. Study 2: Diverse, locally-representative and randomly-sampled adults (N=43) replicates Study 1 findings. Study 3: Patients with schizophrenia (N=27) hold opposing self-concepts, adopting their interlocutor’s while keeping their own. Four distinct flexibility phenotypes emerge.

Background: Much research explores the consequences of parenthood for women, but we know less about health outcomes and trajectories of men who become fathers. Theoretical approaches suggest both health-enhancing changes driven by social control and a new father identity, and health-decreasing changes driven by the costs and burdens of fatherhood.
Method: The NLSY97 longitudinal survey and a battery of novel fixed effects models are used to identify the consequences of paternity on diverse health outcomes, controlling for selectivity based on unobserved characteristics and unobserved trajectories of men who become fathers and accounting for heterogeneity of effects.
Results: Becoming a father induces weight gain and a decline in self-reported health, but reduces alcohol consumption. Effects on weight and alcohol use varied across strata defined by race and education, but changes in self-reported health were consistent across sub-groups.
Conclusion: The transition to fatherhood induces changes in health outcomes and behaviors that are both positive and negative. These consequences are not transitory. Rather, they persist over men’s early adulthood.
Implications: Fatherhood induces health-related changes that endure over the first years after becoming a father, and which may contribute to morbidity and mortality in late adulthood.",TRUE,FALSE,aging|fatherhood|fixed effects|health and illness|millennials|parents|transition to adulthood,2019-07-11T17:16:50.891856,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-11,FALSE,NA,available,NA,https://www.nlsinfo.org/investigator/pages/login,no,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/citation/,x4c7m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/zvnme/,zvnme,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2645db45253a00193b69b1/,5d2645db45253a00193b69b1,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4c7m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x4c7m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x4c7m,https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12732,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The present research paper attempts to address the recurrent thematic element that postmodern fiction revolves around: that of the presence of the historiographic element in postmodern fiction which reflects in itself the evaluation of past history; such a fictional preoccupation reflects the major postmodern philosophers’ and thinkers’ concerns, such as those of Lyotard and Baudrillard, on the impossibility for the existence of a universal coherent history.

Student engagement happens at many levels that correspond to the “principles of good practice in undergraduate education” that were suggested by Chickering and Gamson (1987).  This article tries to identify these aspects of student engagement and good practice in the English Studies Track (EST) program from the EST students’ perspective. The data were collected in three Moroccan universities: Abdelmalek Essaadi University in Tetouan, Ibn Tofail University in Kenitra, and Cadi Ayad University in Marrakech. An adapted version of Student Engagement Questionnaire (Kember, Leung &amp; McNaught, 2009 in Kember &amp; Leung, 2009) was administered to 883 EST students. The data were submitted to a statistical analysis of frequencies using SPSS. The results of this study show that EST students experience a low level of engagement with their studies and that the EST program lacks some aspects of “good practice” in higher education.  This study can help enhance the quality of university programs as it reveals some gaps and negative practices that need to be taken into account in the reform process Moroccan universities are going through. Another implication of this research is that students are aware of their needs and, hence, are able to provide useful feedback that can be used to improve the quality of the teaching and learning environment in Moroccan universities.",TRUE,FALSE,Moroccan university reform|quality enhancement|student engagement|student needs,2019-10-11T16:50:02.469483,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/citation/,9zx7s,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da00ff3a7bc73000dec6fa4/,5da00ff3a7bc73000dec6fa4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/9zx7s/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/9zx7s/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/9zx7s,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no3.11,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In these circumstances, inter-generational reproductive conflicts between younger and older females are predicted to resolve in favor of the younger females, who realize fewer inclusive fitness benefits from ceding reproduction to others. This conceptual model anticipates that immigrants to a community initially have few kin ties to others in the group, gradually showing greater relatedness to group members as they have descendants who remain with them in the group. We examine this prediction in a cross-cultural sample of communities, which vary in their sex-biased dispersal patterns and other aspects of social organization. Drawing on genealogical and demographic data, the analysis provides general but not comprehensive support for the prediction that average relatedness of immigrants to other group members increases as they age. In rare cases, natal members of the community also exhibit age-related increases in relatedness. We also find large variation in the proportion of female group members who are immigrants, beyond simple traditional considerations of patrilocality or matrilocality, which raises questions about the circumstances under which this hypothesis of female competition are met. We consider possible explanations for these heterogenous results, and we address methodological considerations that merit increased attention for research on kinship and reproductive conflict in human societies.",TRUE,FALSE,Descent|Dispersal|Kinship|Life History Theory|Reproductive Conflict|Residence,2019-03-19T14:22:44.701417,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/citation/,xjb7c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/h8cqr/,h8cqr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8fbd404712b400183b30b4/,5c8fbd404712b400183b30b4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/xjb7c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/xjb7c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/xjb7c,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Or, chercher à atteindre ces objectifs en matière de biodiversité peut également affecter les populations qui dépendent de la biodiversité, de ses usages et des valeurs qui lui sont attribuées. Même si les impacts
sociaux sont aussi et de plus en plus pris en compte et atténués par les projets, ceux qui découlent de l’atténuation des impacts sur la biodiversité sont souvent sous-valus et
insuffisamment pris en compte. Ce document met en exergue les principes fondamentaux pour la mise en oeuvre de bonnes pratiques pour la prise en compte optimale des impacts sociaux résultant des pertes et des gains de biodiversité du fait d’un projet de développement et de son application de la hiérarchie d’atténuation. Il vise à:
• Définir les effets sociaux mesurables de la mise en oeuvre de la hiérarchie d’atténuation pour la biodiversité.
• Fournir un cadre pour s’assurer de la bonne intégration des aspects sociaux dans la mise en oeuvre de la compensation pour la biodiversité, conformément aux bonnes pratiques.
• Faciliter, tout au long d’un projet, la collaboration étroite entre toutes les parties prenantes impliquées dans l’atténuation et la compensation des impacts sur la biodiversité, et en en particulier entre les spécialistes environnementaux et sociaux.                                                 Les principes énoncés dans ce document s’appuient sur les bonnes pratiques internationales par lesquelles les projets de développement doivent démontrer une absence de perte nette ou un gain net de biodiversité, tout en s’assurant que les populations affectées ne soient au final pas moins mais de préférence mieux loties par rapport à leur situation de référence. Ils proposent des objectifs de grande qualité en la matière, ce qui, dans la pratique, peut s’avérer être ambitieux pour certains projets. Ils s’appuient sur la littérature et les guides et directives existantes, et sur la synthèse d’une grande diversité de points de vue exprimés au cours d’un processus de consultation approfondi. Nous nous attendons néanmoins à ce qu’ils fassent l’objet de nouvelles améliorations lorsqu’ils seront testés sur le terrain. Les auteurs sont preneurs de toute remarque constructive en ce sens. Ainsi, les projets de développement visant l’absence de perte nette ou le gain net de biodiversité devraient toujours se fixer pour objectif que :
Les populations considèrent que les composantes de leur bien-être affectées par les pertes et les gains de biodiversité sont au moins aussi bonnes à la suite du projet de développement et des mesures visant l’absence de perte nette ou le gain net de biodiversité que si le projet n’avait pas été mis en oeuvre.",TRUE,FALSE,bonnes pratiques|compensation de la biodiversité|développement économique|équité|hiérarchie d’atténuation|impacts sociaux,2019-10-30T12:38:42.554539,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Environmental Policy",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyngd/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyngd/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyngd/citation/,uyngd,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyngd/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyngd/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyngd/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db885debc32f4000e0f906d/,5db885debc32f4000e0f906d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyngd/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyngd/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/uyngd/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uyngd/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/uyngd,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In 2012, the question was changed with the inclusion of an additional response option describing uncertainty about pregnancy desire prior to the pregnancy. This analysis investigates how this additional response option affected women’s responses.
Methods: We use the change in the pregnancy intention question in 2012 as a natural experiment, taking advantage of relatively stable distributions of pregnancy intentions over short periods of time within states. Using PRAMS data from 2009-2014 (N=222,781), we employ a regression discontinuity design to test for differences in the proportion of women choosing each response option in the periods pre- and post-question change. 
Results: In the years 2012-2014, 13-15% of women chose the new answer option, “I wasn’t sure what I wanted”. The addition had a substantial impact on distributions of pregnancy intentions, drawing responses away from all answer choices except for “I wanted to become pregnant then.” Effects were not uniform across age, parity and race combined with Hispanic ethnicity, as well as across states.
Conclusions: These effects could impact estimated levels and trends of the proportion of births that are characterized as intended, mistimed or unwanted, as well as estimates of differences between demographic groups. These findings will help to inform new strategies for measuring women’s pregnancy and childbearing desires.",TRUE,FALSE,PRAMS|Pregnancy Intentions|Public Health|Question wording|Surveillance,2019-03-12T10:45:43.838485,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/citation/,t6pqr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/x8r7v/,x8r7v,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c86acf11d73810017c2f0d2/,5c86acf11d73810017c2f0d2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t6pqr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t6pqr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t6pqr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Political science has introduced a multitude of spectrograms based on different factors, dimensions, axes, and cardinal points.  Most often the graphics do not complement each other, and it seems that each of them describes a completely different reality.  There was an urgent need to conduct an objective analysis of political philosophies and find the factors that influence the political spectrum polarization.

A review of the literature,"This contribution reviews the literature on the role of financial aid in enhancing university participation. This aim will be reached through three main steps. First, we describe a theoretical framework based on rational action theory that could explain the effects exerted by the different measures. Second, we analyse the main forms of financial aid developed by the policy makers in Europe and in the US. More precisely, we look at the role played by: grants, tuition fees, loans and a novel approach in the financial aid debate: asset building.

To do so, the development of linguistic, communicative and socio-pragmatic competences enriched with socio-cultural inputs in English as a Foreign Language (EFL) or Second Language (L2) teaching and learning contexts have a significant impact on language learners both to develop their perception as native speakers of English and to facilitate the progress of cognitive skills and capabilities. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate a case study to show some of the difficulties in teaching English modal auxiliaries to Turkish students in EFL/L2 contexts which arise not only from structural characteristics, but also from insufficiently developed linguistic, communicative and socio-pragmatic competencies. It is also asserted that only teaching the lexical properties of modal auxiliaries in isolation from their socio-pragmatic and semiotic contexts alone cannot help learners to become successful communicators in the target language as it ends in communication failures, hesitation, a slower L2 progress, fear and misunderstandings. Therefore, role-play activities, cloze tests, research assignments, writing tasks and songs can also be integrated into the teaching-learning process to assist learners to become more aware of their actual authentic usages in a wide range of contexts through different activities. On the whole, this would also free language learners to refer to their First Language (L1) input and shape a broader understanding of the Foreign Language (FL) framed with its actual authentic usage.",TRUE,FALSE,cognitive linguistics|competence|curriculum|language learning-teaching|modal auxiliaries,2019-01-03T19:39:22.448815,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-03,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/citation/,kxe9j,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c2c390ea7c0a7001b3cdafd/,5c2c390ea7c0a7001b3cdafd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/kxe9j/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/kxe9j/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/kxe9j,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol9no4.4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How Strong Norms in Organizations Relate to Contractors' Cultural Integration,"Despite evidence that contract workers are often tightly integrated into organizations' work routines and processes, researchers still do not understand when contractors might be more or less culturally integrated with their organizations. How do the prevailing cultural norms in organizations relate to contract workers' cultural integration? It is unclear whether strong norms are conducive to culturally integrating both regular employees and contractors, workers who may have different cultural preferences, and who differ in status as full versus provisional organizational members. Using data from an employer review website, we examine how norm strength in organizations relates to both contractors' and regular employees' cultural integration. While regular employees exhibit more integration in organizations with stronger norms, we find that norm strength is associated with less integration among contractors, specifically those doing more independent jobs. We also examine whether strong collaborative and strong hierarchical norms appear conducive to integrating contractors versus regular employees. The results have implications for the returns to contracting in organizations, and suggest that organizational cultures face trade-offs in integrating workers across different employment arrangements.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-12-29T21:32:01.878722,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-29,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/citation/,cxrjy,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5e08a59e1a65e9004971b1e4/,5e08a59e1a65e9004971b1e4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cxrjy/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cxrjy/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cxrjy,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Berle for a More Democratic Financial System,"At the close of the 1930s, Adolf Berle – brain truster and co-author of The Modern Corporation and Private Property – developed a plan for a “modern financial tool-kit.” This paper recovers Berle’s program for financial reform. The discussion opens with an overview of Berle’s personal and intellectual history, the historical moment in which he developed these proposals, and a summary of alternative proposals circulating at the time. Berle’s own proposals are then presented. Notably, we find that Berle stresses the need for (quasi-)public banks, improved infrastructure finance, and loan guarantees for small business. Based on these proposals, we draw three lessons for efforts to democratize finance today. The first concerns the importance of critiquing misguided alternatives. Here we assert that proponents of democratized finance should push back against private equity’s encroachment on public infrastructure. The second lesson takes inspiration from Berle’ invocation of precedents for government action as justifications for further reform. Here we argue for a closer focus on the trillions in loans currently owned or guaranteed via federal credit programs. The third lesson takes inspiration from Berle’s articulation of core principles to guide reform. In that tradition, we offer a distillation of the overarching principles of Berle that might guide democratic financial reform today: fair allocation, local and global sustainability, and political accountability.",TRUE,FALSE,banking|credit|economics history|finance|infrastructure|political economy,2019-09-28T02:19:44.104885,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/citation/,7e2fc,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8e5c2fc43280001dc63798/,5d8e5c2fc43280001dc63798,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7e2fc/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7e2fc/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7e2fc,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We investigate whether the rise of immigration influenced the novel and salient outcome of preferences for greater law enforcement spending. We propose that these preferences are consequential for policymaking, reflect popular demand for punitive social control, and represent micro-level preferences underlying the politics of criminal justice. Motivated by literatures on criminal justice politics, minority threat, and the fear of crime, we examine whether stocks and flows of immigration influence individual-level preferences for greater law enforcement spending. Using International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data, we analyze between-country variation with multi-level models of 25 countries in 2006, and within-country variation with differences-in-differences (DD) models of 16 countries with available data in both 1996 and 2006. Both multilevel and DD models show that flows of immigration increase preferences for greater law enforcement spending. Indeed, the coefficients for immigration flows are larger than or comparable in magnitude to the coefficients for any other variable, and are robust net of homicide rates and police officers per 100,000. By contrast, the stock of immigrants is not robustly associated with preferences. The results demonstrate that rising immigration contributed to increasing public support for greater law enforcement spending.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-02-27T21:33:46.452115,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-27,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",Joshua J Fink; David Brady,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/citation/,92zwa,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/a76hd/,a76hd,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c76e7de82a3950019cff719/,5c76e7de82a3950019cff719,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/92zwa/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/92zwa/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/92zwa,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

More than 5.7 million in total, Obama-to-Trump voters were essential to Trump’s victory in the Electoral College.  They were more likely to be white, working class, and resident in the Midwest.  They had lower levels of political interest, were centrist in both party affiliation and ideology, and were late deciders for the 2016 election.  On economic interests, they were centrists, except for trade policy, which they viewed, on average, as a greater threat than other voters.  They claimed to have more experience with economic vulnerability than Democratic loyalists of comparable social standing.  On racial attitudes, including the racialized economic topic of immigration, they had a profile similar to Republican loyalists.  While their support of Trump may be attributable to surging white nativism, this article argues for an alternative explanation.  Voters who were attracted by Trump’s economic populism only joined his coalition if they could accept his racialized rhetoric.

Theoretically speaking, the goal behind such reform is to shift from a content-based to a process-based learning/teaching and thus to make learning more relevant and realistic for students. However, in practice, teachers find difficulties in putting into practice the two approaches. The aim of the present paper is to explore those obstacles that hinder the execution of the PBL approach in the third-year secondary education English classes and to identify to what extent English language teachers master and use PBL methodology in their classes. To reach the aim of the study, the following hypothesis is put forward: teachers lack both training and background knowledge on the approaches that help to implement PBL in classrooms. For the sake of collecting information about the issue tackled in this study, twenty EFL teachers from some secondary schools in Mostaganem city received a questionnaire. The research findings confirm the hypothesis mentioned above. They reveal that teachers neither master nor use the project-based instruction proficiently in their classrooms despite the guidance provided in the third-year pedagogical documents. Those hindrances are due to the lack of professional training and the insufficient theoretical knowledge on the diverse approaches, methods and strategies related to PBL",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-07-20T21:40:45.231744,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-20,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/citation/,b8jpu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5caa5437df977b001af3da5d/,5caa5437df977b001af3da5d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/b8jpu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/b8jpu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/b8jpu,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/vol10no1.23,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

When they do, their methods typically focus on discrete policies in isolation—same-sex marriage, no-fault divorce, etc.—with comparatively little investigation of potential connections among policies. This article begins to develop a more holistic approach focused on identifying and explaining what I call conjugal-recognition regimes. Adapting the concept from the existing literature on welfare regimes, I argue that conjugal-recognition regimes exist when an identifiable pattern or principle organizes an institution’s conjugal-recognition policies. Such regimes shape social relations at multiple levels, both between the individuals in conjugal relationships and among the multiple institutions (state, religious, and so on) that confer official conjugal recognition. I argue that these organizing patterns or principles emerge out of historically specific, institutionally situated, and discursively constructed political debates on specific conjugal issues and, to the extent a regime in fact exists, go on to shape subsequent conjugal-policy controversies. I demonstrate these ideas through an extended analysis of post-apartheid South African marriage law, which has recently incorporated numerous previously excluded conjugal formations but has also assigned each new form to its own statutory and administrative structure or, as I call it, “silo.” I argue that these silos entrench a principle of “gendered multiculturalism” that officially defines cultures in terms of their supposedly characteristic gender relations. This principle increasingly tends to embed religious and cultural elites’ understandings of their respective traditions into the state’s marriage laws.",TRUE,FALSE,African marriage|customary law|customary marriage|gender|historical institutionalism|Islamic marriage|legal pluralism|marriage|multiculturalism|Muslim marriage|policy regimes|post-apartheid|same-sex marriage|South Africa,2019-05-06T15:08:29.657718,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c16|Law|Law and Gender|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f1c698300375c76c4b|Law|Law and Society|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c5f|Law|Family Law|5a8c80f0c698300375c76c07|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c67|Law|Legislation|5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f3c698300375c76c99|Arts and Humanities|African Languages and Societies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e39|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Collective Behavior and Social Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e43|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Comparative and Historical Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e44|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Race, Gender, and Class|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/citation/,bg37v,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ccd1c27103390001a9b3bcb/,5ccd1c27103390001a9b3bcb,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg37v/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bg37v/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bg37v,https://doi.org/10.1093/sp/jxv016,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Combining insights from hermeneutic theories of the self and pragmatist theories of action, we develop a theoretical position that challenges dichotomous assumptions about whether motive accounts reflect either justifications or motivations for action, instead illustrating how they can migrate from one status to the other over time.

Women may be pushed out of computing in their youth, but they can come back—and they do. Using data from in-depth interviews with women graduates of coding bootcamps (accelerated programs that teach beginners digital skills), this study provides empirical data on how and why women enter computing later in life, often after having non-technical degrees and careers. This study finds that to successfully enter the computing workforce, women must arrive at three end states, which are often achieved via three transitions: “I can’t code” to “I may code;” “I’m on another path” to “I want to code;” and “I can code” to “I do code.” In addition, this study finds surprising evidence of women choosing to enter computing for better pay and work-life balance, in contrast to research that suggests women leave for these reasons.

However, parental wealth is often ignored in research on social inequality in education, or its influence is only considered at later stages of children’s educational careers. Our paper contributes to this research by examining the relationship between parental wealth and (1) children’s math competences at the beginning of primary school; (2) the development of children’s competences throughout primary school; and (3) children’s transition from primary to secondary school. We are looking at Germany, where the early ability tracking may make an early investment in education particularly important. Analyzing data from the German National Educational Panel Study, we find that parental wealth has a distinct association with children’s educational outcomes that adds to social disparities by other measures of parents’ socioeconomic status (SES). Our results indicate that children in wealthy households have higher competences already in the first grade. This advantage remains stable throughout primary school and translates into a higher probability to attend the highest secondary school track. Moreover, children in these wealthy households are more likely to attend the highest secondary school track, net of differences in competences and performance.

Focusing on openness to racial exogamy as an indicator of racial boundaries, we examine the link between Christian nationalism and white Americans’ views toward their hypothetical daughter marrying an African American, Latino, or Asian. Drawing on theoretical insights from social identity complexity theory, we argue that the convergence of religious and national identities serves to reinforce in-group boundaries, thereby fortifying notions of white purity, and consequently, strengthening whites’ discomfort with potential race-mixing in marriage. Multivariate analyses of national survey data demonstrate that Christian nationalism is strongly associated with an increase in white Americans’ discomfort with their daughter marrying any racial minority, and particularly African Americans.

Thus, the colonized country becomes torn between former traditions and newly modern perspectives. In this respect, the focus of this research paper will fall over as it witnessed Western imposition over its society that tried, in its turn, to maintain a traditional lifestyle, while there were attempts for change. Hence, the researcher attempts to shed light on Jordan-as it sways between traditions and imposed reforms- through the literary work of Fadia Ahmed Faqir, whose main motivation resides in the strong messages she conveys in her novel The Cry of the Dove. Thus, the concern of this paper is how far carrying a double identity affects people’s sense of belonging? In this respect, the article introduces a hint of the author’s life embodied in the protagonist Salma, who carries a swaying identity torn between tradition and modernity through her adventures.  Salma moves forward and backward through time, then she- the protagonist-wins a voice in a foreign country and adopts a new standard of living, releasing herself from the cultural boundaries of Jordan.

Methods: A mixed methods approach was used, consisting of a review of a sample of unresolved homicides, a comparative analysis of the frequency of known serial homicide series and unresolved serial homicide series, and semi-structured interviews of experts.
Results: The past decade contained almost half the cases (13%) that existed at the 1980s peak of serial homicide (27%). Only 282 (1.3%) strangled females made up the 22,444 unresolved homicides reviewed. Most expert respondents thought it unreasonable that any meaningful proportion of missing persons cases are victims of serial homicide. 
Conclusions: Technology, shifts in offending behavior, proactive law enforcement action, and vigilance of society have transformed serial killing and aids in viewing offenders as people impacted by societal shifts and cultural norms. The absence of narrative details inhibited some aspects of the review. An exhaustive list of known unresolved serial homicide series remained elusive as some missing persons are never reported.

In Algeria, Law students receive ELP course aimed to help them in their studies and future careers. However, at the end of their learning process these students still find linguistic and communication difficulties in situations where English is needed as the course received is no more than teaching specific words and phrases and translating some texts following the traditional Grammar Translation Method. Accordingly, this paper aims to presents the current ELP course situation and to measure students’ and teachers’ attitudes towards the use of Blended ELP course based on Content Language Integrated Learning model. The course has twofold: to provide students with international legal knowledge and to compare them to the Algerian one, and to expose learners to intensive reading activities and overcome lack of teaching time activities. In this quantitative study, seven teachers were interviewed and fifty seven masters’ students were questioned. The results revealed that the students have comprehension difficulties because the time load for reading activities is not sufficient.

In particular, I define lineal kinship organization as a social system that emphasizes interactions among lineally related kin — that is, individuals related through females only, if the emphasis is towards matrilineal kin, and individuals related through males only, if the emphasis is towards patrilineal kin. In a given population, the emphasis may be expressed in one or more social domains, corresponding to pathways for the transmission of different resources across generations (e.g. the allocation of food, the transfer of access to the natal territory or household).
A lineal bias in any domain can be viewed as a bias in investment towards a particular set of kin — specifically, towards the offspring of daughters if the bias is matrilineal, and towards the offspring of sons if the bias is patrilineal. Effectively, investment is restricted to the offspring of the females in the population in one case, and to the offspring of the males in the other. This is distinct from a bias in investment towards daughters and towards sons, respectively.
Overall, I propose a shift in focus — from viewing matrilineal and patrilineal kinship as unitary phenomena, to consideration of the different aspects of the social system featuring a bias towards lineally related kin.",TRUE,FALSE,descent|kinship systems|lineal kinship organization|matrilineal|patrilineal|post-marital residence,2019-03-15T18:28:41.535204,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Other Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/citation/,2sznm,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c8bd6b3075b640019a2ae7b/,5c8bd6b3075b640019a2ae7b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sznm/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2sznm/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2sznm,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Contemporary American Ukrainian writers have made attempts to introduce their hybrid experience and include it into American culture. One of them is Alexander J. Motyl, whose novel Fall River (2014) is analyzed as an example of border writing. The novel is based on the author’s narrative memory, rooted in his mother’s stories about Ukraine and their family members’ crossings of borders in the interwar period and belonging to two cultures, Ukrainian and American, that shaped their identities.

By focusing on a major childcare reform in East and West Germany, we examine the effect in two contexts that differ markedly in the acceptance and use of formal childcare and maternal employment. We combine rich longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (2006 to 2014) with annual administrative county-level data on the availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare, estimating event history models. The results indicate that increased childcare availability for under-three-year-olds reduces mothers’ employment interruptions, particularly after a second childbirth, and increases the probability of returning to part-time or full-time employment as opposed to marginal employment. Furthermore, increased availability of low-cost, state-subsidised childcare increases mothers’ likelihood of returning to employment in the second year after childbirth, when paid leave entitlements expire and the availability of childcare becomes important. However, our results are only statistically significant for West German mothers and only after the birth of a second child. The study extends the literature on women’s return-to-work behaviour by providing evidence on the medium-term impact of family policy on the duration of mothers’ employment interruptions.",TRUE,FALSE,childcare|duration of employment interruption|early childhood education|family policy|maternal employment|social policy,2019-10-17T17:40:22.306380,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e48|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Labor and Labor Movements|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/citation/,jb28c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5da860b0f1b0a9000c6251d5/,5da860b0f1b0a9000c6251d5,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jb28c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jb28c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jb28c,https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcx068,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I argue that rural natural resource dependence represents a special case of the core periphery relationship, where rural, resource rich labor markets form a dual dependency on both the global capitalist economy and the local natural environment. This occurs because the contradiction between spatially fixed natural resources and the mobility of capital prompts both external interests and local power elites to use their power to pressure rural labor markets in directions outside their best interest and to exploit rural labor. I argue that both extractive (e.g. mining, timber, agriculture) and non extractive (e. tourism, real estate) forms of natural resource development share this contradiction. Although pushing different uses of the resource base, extractive and non extractive development do not fundamentally vary in their exploitative relationship with rural labor markets.",TRUE,FALSE,Dependency|Extraction|Natural resource dependence|Poverty|Resource curse|Tourism|Uneven Development|United States,2019-07-31T21:01:01.433004,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-31,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Environmental Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4akp/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4akp/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4akp/citation/,e4akp,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4akp/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4akp/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/xfyug/,xfyug,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4akp/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d419d453ce935001aebdc46/,5d419d453ce935001aebdc46,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4akp/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4akp/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/e4akp/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/e4akp/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/e4akp,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Most accounts of campaigns’ strategic decision-makers treat them as masterminds – individuals who devise tactics based on brilliant political insight or masterful data analysis. Others assume they are mercenaries, milking the electoral process for all the money they can regardless of their own ideological commitments or what might actually help candidates win elections. Neither of these approaches is sufficient to understand how political professionals understand their work; they ignore both the fundamental uncertainty of campaign effects and the particularities of the work-world of political operatives. Drawing on 79 interviews with 67 campaign staff and consultants with high-level experience in Presidential and Senate campaigns, I argue that they should be understood as participants in a field of cultural production, which functions much like other arenas where communicative materials are crafted. Gaining esteem and coveted positions within the field is most participants’ primarily motivation, and the quality of the messages, images, and strategies they produce is judged less by measurable effects on voters than by an internally-generated set of norms and ideas about best practices.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-06-04T11:32:51.836895,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db5|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|American Politics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/citation/,2sb9m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf57f564df3460019bd54a6/,5cf57f564df3460019bd54a6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/2sb9m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2sb9m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/2sb9m,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

This pattern of waning effects could well be the result of selective attrition, since those of modest social origins who make a given transition may have unobserved characteristics, such as cognitive or noncognitive skills, that help them make the next transition, while better off individuals may be less steeply selected on these characteristics. I study a sample of American 10th graders from 1980 to assess how much the pattern of waning effects is due to selective attrition along academic and noncognitive skills for this cohort. I find that controlling for academic skills makes the effect of socioeconomic status more stable across transitions, but controlling for noncognitive skills does not. Socioeconomic advantage does not decline uniformly across transitions, and it appears most pronounced at the transition into college. These results do not support a claim that late transitions are egalitarian.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-09-21T23:49:03.446958,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility",N/A,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/citation/,bxe4t,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d86425b51eeee0017bdaace/,5d86425b51eeee0017bdaace,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bxe4t/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bxe4t/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bxe4t,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Hence, this paper addresses the following question: how should the methodology course be reformulated to render it more efficient in raising students’ awareness of this issue? An analysis of some research methods manuals currently in use reveals that two major obstacles hinder students ‘ability to learn this issue: the pluralistic nature of applied linguistics and the rampant use of mixed methodologies. To overcome these obstacles, this paper proposes a teaching strategy consisting of focusing the initial phase on a contrastive analysis of two methods, which stand at extreme positions on the methodological continuum in applied linguistics, namely, experimental design and ethnography. Moreover, given that the presentation of the differences between these two methods is not sufficient, the paper argues that this presentation should be reinforced by a foregrounding of the essential differences in problem statement in the two research traditions in question.

El presente artículo relata las diferentes perspectivas que existen dentro del movimiento feminista chileno, el cual lucha y se mantiene vigente por un mismo propósito que consiste principalmente en la equidad de género, sin embargo, es innegable la diversidad de feminismos que existen dentro del movimiento, promoviendo una infinidad de consignas que configuran nuevos sujetos e ideales por los que luchar. Para este artículo se realizó una encuesta digitalizada, de la cual se utilizaron las respuestas para el desarrollo de un análisis y comprensión sobre lo que opinaban las personas acerca del feminismo actual en Chile en un contexto coyuntural durante el año 2019. A su vez, este registro pareciera revelar la existencia de una estigmatización hacia el género masculino, generando diversas opiniones acerca de la presencia de este dentro del movimiento social. Además, la mayoría de las respuestas de las personas, promueven la idealización de la sororidad, y cómo esta acción parece ayudar, entender y unir a las mujeres y disidencias en esta lucha. Por otro lado, se ponen en evidencia ciertos prejuicios y supuestos que están afectando la comprensión del movimiento feminista chileno, lo que conlleva la necesidad de articular un feminismo interseccional y de implementar una lucha antipatriarcal y antisistémica.

The researcher adopts the view of social learning, particularly in reaching better understandings of the learners’ experiences in learning English. As there exists a tendency to gauge learners’ success in English based on examinations, this study asserts that language learning involves more than a cognitive process, thus values the social aspects of experiential English learning. The focus lies on investigating the perceptions of these high achieving English language learners of their success in learning English as well as the influences contributing to it. Two methods are used to collect data: focus groups and interviews. The findings indicate the participants’ perceptions of their own success in learning English in three main aspects:  English language ability, examination performance and skills in teaching others. In particular, the ability to speak English fluently and correctly appears to be of utmost importance for a successful English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learner. It is also found that most learners identify their own performance in class, the teacher, including teacher rapport, and school culture as contributing to their English learning achievement. In focusing on the learners’ perceptions and their actual experiences, insights into how the learners actually undergo the learning opportunities provided by the education system can be obtained.

In this paper, we focus on the unemployed’s expectations of being stigmatized (stigma consciousness) and the consequences of such negative expectations on job search attitudes and behaviour. Using data from the panel study “Labour Market and Social Security” (PASS), we find that the unemployed with high stigma consciousness suffer from reduced well-being and health. Regarding job search, the stigmatized unemployed
are more likely to expect that their chances of re-employment are low, but in contrast, they are more likely to place a high value on becoming re-employed. Instead of becoming discouraged and passive, we find that stigmatized unemployed
individuals increase their job search effort compared to other unemployed individuals.

It closely follows Brown's model of L2 speech perception and L1 feature geometry (1998), which seeks to relate theories of segmental phonology to L2 speech perception and the first exposure treatment of Gullberg et al. (2010). Eight Arabic sounds were carefully selected for the experiment: /b/-/d/ which are found in both English and Arabic; /x/-/ɣ/ which are not found in English but are distinguished by features which are distinctive in English [dorsal, voice, continuant], and lastly the contrastive pairs /ʔ/-/ʕ/ and /h/-/ħ/, where the latter phoneme in each pair is alien to the phonemic inventory of English. These pairs are distinguished by the feature [RTR (retracted tongue root)] which is lacking in the feature geometry of English. Participants were divided into an Arabic control group, English+ group with prior exposure to Arabic, and an English group with no prior exposure to Arabic.

Therefore, the aim has been to identify those difficulties from an error analysis standpoint and identify the sources underlying them. An analysis of a written corpus of forty students' written essays was thoroughly conducted. Types of errors were categorized, and the factors that contributed to them were analyzed. The participants were English majors in their third year of study enrolled in an advanced writing course during the first term pertinent to the academic year 2018-2019. Three essays were given to each participant to write about two to four pages using the narrative, descriptive, and compare/contrast organization. A writing difficulties questionnaire was further employed. The findings showed that the most frequent types of errors made by the participants were: punctuation errors forming the most troublesome area, followed by spelling errors, preposition errors, article errors, wrong verb tense, wrong word form respectively.

Debt patterns, by contrast, have remained relatively unexplored. Using 2001-2013 data from the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF), we show that after peaking in 2007, debt levels for most debt types had returned to pre-financial crisis levels for blacks and whites by 2013. The primary exception to this is education debt, on which this paper focuses. We show that educational debt has increased substantially for blacks relative to whites in the past decade. We also show that this increase in debt is not attributable to differences in educational attainment across racial groups. These trends, we argue, reflect a process of predatory inclusion, where lenders and financial actors offer needed services to black households, but on exploitative terms that limit or eliminate their long-term benefits.

Still, the conventional FE estimator relies on the assumption of parallel trends between treated and untreated groups. It returns biased results in the presence of heterogeneous slopes or growth curves that are related to the parameter of interest (e.g., selection into treatment is based on individual growth of the outcome). In this study, we derive the bias in conventional FE models, and show that fixed effects individual slope (FEIS) models can overcome this problem. This is a more general version of the conventional FE model, which accounts for heterogeneous slopes or trends, thereby providing a powerful tool for panel data and other multilevel data in general. We propose two versions of the Hausman test that can be used to identify misspecification in FE models. The performance of the FEIS estimator and the specification tests is evaluated in a series of Monte Carlo experiments. Using the examples of the marital wage premium and returns to preschool education (Head Start), we demonstrate how taking heterogeneous effects into account can seriously change the conclusions drawn from conventional FE models. Thus, we propose to test for bias in FE models in practical applications and to apply FEIS if indicated by the specification tests.",TRUE,FALSE,fixed effects|fixed effects individual slopes|Hausman test|Head Start returns|heterogeneous effects|marital wage premium|Monte Carlo simulations,2019-04-08T22:24:28.126999,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-08,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc7|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Econometrics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology,Tobias Rüttenauer|Volker Ludwig,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/citation/,k4rnu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/dr8x3/,dr8x3,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cab46cbdf977b001af44b10/,5cab46cbdf977b001af44b10,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k4rnu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k4rnu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k4rnu,https://doi.org/10.1177/0049124120926211,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Natural resource development generally takes two forms, extractive (e.g. oil and gas, mining, timber) and non-extractive (e.g. tourism, recreation, real estate). However, research has rarely examined both in-tandem. Drawing on the concept of dependence (i.e. over-specialization), I test the hypothesis that increasing levels of both forms of development was associated with diminishing returns to economic prosperity— operationalized as per capita income, inequality, and poverty—in rural America over the period of 2000 to 2015. Extractive development exhibited the expected relationship in remote rural counties for all outcomes, while non-extractive development had a generally negative relationship with per capita income, a positive relationship with poverty, and no relationship with inequality.

Most empirical and all experimental sciences require some form of data analysis, including qualitative methods. However, even those in degree or formal educational programs learning about statistics/biostatistics/data science do not receive training in what constitutes “ethical practice”. The American Statistical Association (ASA) maintains, and recently (2018) updated, Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice. Understanding and being able to utilize these Guidelines (GLs) is relevant for all applications of statistical and data science methodologies – whether for true “research” (following the scientific method) or for business or other predictive/decision-making support. Thus, students who will go on to be statisticians and non-statisticians alike need to learn about ethical statistical practice, including those who seek to apply these methods in marketing, policy, and higher education. This article describes how to employ the case study method to teach the ASA GLs, using simple vignettes and a specific tool called a “stakeholder analysis template”.

Although migration research has established the proximate relationship between armed conflict and increases in migration, much less attention has been paid to the long-term, or distal relationship. This research leverages the case of the 1992-1997 Tajikistani Civil War to examine the distal relationship between armed conflict and migration decisions nearly a decade after the war had ended. Using a series of logistic regression models and a selection-based endogeneity correction, I estimate the likelihood of migrating in 2006, given the intensity of conflict experience at the district level. I find that, controlling for individual, household, and district-level indicators, the legacy of conflict continues to influence migration – for men and for ‘stayers’ – nearly a decade after the peace accord was signed. Some evidence suggests that certain kinds of development projects can moderate this relationship. In conflict-affected countries, incorporating the legacy of conflict into empirical research can help scholars and policy-makers better understand migration in the aftermath of war.",TRUE,FALSE,civil war|development|migration|tajikistan,2019-09-15T11:40:46.531953,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-15,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/citation/,qn5xv,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7e13d37483ec001851e918/,5d7e13d37483ec001851e918,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/qn5xv/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/qn5xv/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/qn5xv,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

There are several factors such as social, economic, political, demographic, natural, and livelihood strategies that causes to the vulnerability of the status of household food security. Therefore examining the vulnerability of these factors is essential to identify the reason and recognize the most vulnerable communities. This study is an attempt to study on the vulnerability of the factors of household food availability and its linkage with climatic changes in Malaysia. The study is based on primary data collected in the months of July – October, 2012 through a questionnaire survey on 460 low income households from East Coast Economic Region (ECER) in Malaysia. The samples were selected from E-Kasih poor household database, based on cluster random sampling technique. The study found that the vulnerability of the factors of household food availability has decreased statistically significantly over the last five years period in Malaysia for the factors of effectiveness of food distribution process, road and transportation facility for food distribution process, availability of expected food in the local market, sufficiency of expected food in the local market, and stability of food supply in market. The mean values of the current status of the factors of household food availability differ significantly at 1% significance level from the scenario of 5 years ago. However, most of the cases climatic issues were found less responsible for the changes of these factors. Though Malaysia is adversely affected by climatic change, the factors of food availability are not affected yet remarkably. This study suggests that the food security programs need to be integrated with climatic change adaptation programs to ensure more effective and sustainable household food security in future, especially among the poor and low income group. Moreover, a proper monitoring agency is required to ensure consistent supply of food in the rural and remote areas, especially at the time of natural calamity or off season.",TRUE,FALSE,Climatic changes|Food availability|Household food security|Poverty|Vulnerability,2019-02-28T19:27:46.775647,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-28,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/649we/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/649we/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/649we/citation/,649we,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/649we/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/649we/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/puqk7/,puqk7,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/649we/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c776ee282a3950017d59c5b/,5c776ee282a3950017d59c5b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/649we/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/649we/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/649we/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/649we/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/649we,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In doing so, we can separate two sources of information: knowledge we have about the particular individual (individual knowledge) and knowledge we have about the social group to which that individual belongs (categorical knowledge). However, it is yet unclear how these two types of knowledge contribute to making predictions about other people’s choice behavior. To fill this gap, we had participants learn probabilistic preferences by predicting object choices of agents that either belonged to a social group (Group condition) or not (Individual condition). We quantified how close predictions for a specific agent are relative to the objective individual preferences of that agent and how close these predictions are relative to the objective group-level preferences to which that agent belongs. As expected, we found that participants’ predictions in the Group condition, relative to the Individual condition, were more similar to the group-level preference, while less similar to the individual-level preferences. We interpret this pattern of results as indicative of a differential weighting of individual and categorical group knowledge when making predictions about individuals that belong to a social group.

The study conducted for 12 weeks in 2018- 2019 academic year, in Zulfi College of Education, Majmaah University, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The sample consists of 64 female students divided equally into two groups: experimental and control groups. The experimental group studied an advanced college writing course supported by the creative writing multitasks designed by the researcher. A group of pre and posttest design was applied in the study. When the pre and posttest’s scores of the experimental group were analyzed and compared, it was detected that there was a statistically considerable difference in the pre- and posttest scores, in favor of posttest’s score. Also, it shows that there was a significant difference in the mean scores of the experimental and control group posttest’s scores, favoring the experimental group posttest’s score. These results prove the main research hypothesis: Creative writing multi-tasks have a significant impact on developing the experimental group’s creative writing competence, compared to the control group. The findings indicate that using creative writing multitasks has a positive effect on developing the students’ creative writing competence in both fiction and nonfiction essays.

This paper draws on data from 2,926 adults interviewed in the Malawi Longitudinal Study of Families and Health to examine how marital status, categorized as never, formerly, monogamously, and polygynous married, and number of children is associated with psychological well-being. With respect to marital status, we find that women in polygynous unions fare worse than monogamously married women and this detrimental effect is stronger for women than for men. Formerly married men and women of reproductive age experience the worst psychological outcomes, although this association wanes with age. In contrast, the benefits of having children is only evident among older Malawians, especially women.

It allows for collateral posting adhering to bankruptcy laws. As such, the model can back out the market price of a collateralized contract. This framework is very useful for valuing outstanding derivatives. Using a unique dataset, we find empirical evidence that credit risk alone is not overly important in determining credit-related spreads. Only accounting for both collateral arrangement and credit risk can sufficiently explain unsecured credit costs. This finding suggests that failure to properly account for collateralization may result in significant mispricing of derivatives. We also empirically gauge the impact of collateral agreements on risk measurements. Our findings indicate that there are important interactions between market and credit risk. https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dh9mr/download",TRUE,FALSE,asset pricing|collateralization|CVA|interaction between market and credit risk|plumbing of financial system|swap premium spread|VaR,2019-09-14T11:44:49.938499,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/citation/,dh9mr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d7c29517483ec001850e5a7/,5d7c29517483ec001850e5a7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dh9mr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dh9mr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dh9mr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We focus on 30 Natural Geographic Areas (NGAs) distributed over 10 major world regions (Europe, Africa, Southwest Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, East Asia, Central Eurasia, North America, South America, and Oceania). The conceptual framework that we use to obtain these estimates combines the influences of the production technologies (and how they change with time), climate change, and effects of artificial selection into a Relative Yield Coefficient, indicating how agricultural productivity changed over time in each NGA between the Neolithic and the 20th century. We then use estimates of historical yield in each NGA to translate the Relative Yield Coefficient into an Estimated Yield (tonnes per hectare per year) trajectory. We tested the proposed methodology in two ways.

In this essay, we will first set out the context in which Oñati Socio-legal Series was created. We will then aim to offer a non-exhaustive view of what an open access journal is and what it implies for scholars and for publishers, and the, sometimes, stark differences in each one’s view. From here, we will move on to draw a succinct description of the implications of the mainstream journal publishing scheme, with a stress on the commercial and economic implications. We will then narrow the focus and zero in on the case of Oñati Socio-legal Series. Drawing on the case of this journal, we will argue why it is possible to expand a 100% free Open Access journal model, with no charges whatsoever on the authors, and why it is necessary for the scientific community.",TRUE,FALSE,academic journals|academic writing|gold open access|iisl-iisj|oñati socio-legal series|open access|technical writing,2019-12-09T22:18:42.760660,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-09,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d06|Arts and Humanities|Technical and Professional Writing|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Law,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25rwu/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25rwu/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25rwu/citation/,25rwu,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25rwu/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25rwu/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25rwu/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dee245331d852000c06325a/,5dee245331d852000c06325a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25rwu/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25rwu/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/25rwu/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/25rwu/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/25rwu,https://doi.org/10.35295/osls.iisl/0000-0000-0000-1112,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It uses the same methodological procedures and applies them to a for-profit, general interest firearm magazine that has been continuously published for 65 years: Guns magazine. Like the earlier study, we hypothesize that the center of gravity in US gun culture has evolved over time from “Gun Culture 1.0,” the historic gun culture of hunting and recreational shooting, to “Gun Culture 2.0,” America’s contemporary defensive gun culture, an evolution reflected in the content of gun advertisements. The data show that the predominance of Gun Culture 1.0 themes in advertising persists through the 1980s and into the 1990s, when the center of gravity of gun culture begins to shift decisively toward the Gun Culture 2.0 themes of personal protection/self-defense and concealed carry. This trend continues through the 1990s and 2000s, with the two emphases crossing-over in the 2010s.

The diversification of migration is put forward as one rationale for implementing measures to support immigrant integration across policy fields and across levels of policy making. In this chapter and against the backdrop of the book’s empirical work, I ask how else, beyond being a rationale for mainstreaming, thinking about superdiversity might add to debates about what is mainstreamed.

It also evaluates the use of Gaelic words referenced to Caithness within Gaelic areas south and west of Caithness. As a result of this investigation a number of features emerged.  Firstly, there are a high number of Gaelic words present in Caithness Scots.  Secondly, the borrowing appears to have been one way as there didn’t appear to be much borrowing from Caithness Scots into local Gaelic. Thirdly, an intriguing question arose, although out with the focus of this study, that the language boundaries apparent from terrestrial place names may not be coincident with the boundaries of names of features pertaining to the sea.

With a so ancient a practice as intertextuality; influence, allusion and quotation seem to smolder the old assumptions about originality and creativity. Therefore, this paper attempts to explore the utilization of intertextuality in the novel entitled The Lonely Londoners (1956) by the Trinidadian postcolonial writer Sam Selvon (1923-1994). To do so, a survey on the provenance of intertextuality is displayed, with reference to its pioneers who claimed that the text is a heterogeneous combination of texts, namely Kristeva and Bakhtin. Additionally, the article introduces several models of the concept that are relevant to the analysis of the aforementioned novel along with a brief overview on the cultural and social parameters leading to its creation. This inquiry shows that The Lonely Londoners textually intertwines with a few works of the literary canon, biblical characters and eminent legal cases via some names of its characters, in addition to other direct quotations. As this paper submits, the audience should reach a rational stance on the use of intertextuality in the postcolonial novel to relate to universally shared images about racial prejudice and alienation.",TRUE,FALSE,alienation|allusion|intertextuality|literary canon|quotation|racial prejudice|Sam Selvon|The Lonely Londoners,2019-07-25T19:31:22.084559,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/citation/,3qwbe,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6f627782a3950017cc1e1f/,5c6f627782a3950017cc1e1f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3qwbe/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3qwbe/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3qwbe,https://doi.org/10.24093/awejtls/vol3no1.17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The Case of Georges Laplace's Group of Typologie Analytique, 1950s–1990s","The majority of analyses investigating the professionalization of scientific domains tend to assume the linear and general features of this transformation. These studies focus on the shift from a non-professionalized state to a professionalized state. This dual approach, however, crucially lacks some other aspects of the process of professionalization. This issue is discussed within the context of the growth of prehistoric archaeology in France from the 1940s, by observing scientific societies, national research organizations and their social networks.

To conduct the analysis, the researcher selected a sample covering the preamble and the three main parts of the Convention representing legal texts in general. Throughout the analysis, every translation shift was traced and manually counted to identify the most frequent type of translation shifts. The inevitability of each of the identified shifts was examined to conclude how necessary translation shifts were to preserve the meaning and effect of the source text. The findings indicated that intra-system shifts were the most frequent type of shifts with the frequency of 174 shifts (=26.6%), followed by unit shifts scoring 171 shifts (=26.3%), then structure shifts with the frequency of 161 shifts (=24.6%), then class shifts being identified 128 times (=19.6%), and finally level shifts with the frequency of 19 shifts (=2.9%). Regarding the inevitability of resorting to translation shifts, 80.1% (=523 cases) of identified translation shifts were obligatory due to the linguistic disparities between English and Arabic. Only 19.9% of detected (=130 cases) were optional due to the technicality of legal texts.

Entropy-maximizing spatial interaction models are a means of building parsimonious models that average over much of this small-scale complexity, while maintaining key large-scale structural features. Dynamic social interaction models extend this approach by allowing archaeologists to explore the co-evolution of human settlement systems and the networks of interaction that drive them. Yet, such models are often imprecise, relying on generalized notions of settlement ""influence"" and ""attractiveness"" rather than concrete material flows of goods and people. Here, I present a dis-aggregated spatial interaction model that explicitly resolves trade and migration flows and their combined influence on settlement growth and decline. I explore how the balance of costs and benefits of each type of interaction influence long-term settlement patterns. I find trade flows are the strongest determinant of equilibrium settlement structure, and that migration flows play a more transient role in balancing site hierarchies. This model illustrates how the broad toolkit for spatial interaction modeling developed in geography and economics can increase the precision of quantitative theory building in archaeology, and provides a road-map for connecting mechanistic models to the empirical archaeological record.",TRUE,FALSE,agricultural hinterland|archaeological networks|competition for resources|settlement patterns|spatial interaction model,2019-09-26T15:12:42.565612,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-26,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Spatial Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db6|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Agricultural and Resource Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Archaeological Anthropology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/citation/,trbf8,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d8c5109c8a75d0019605f2a/,5d8c5109c8a75d0019605f2a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/trbf8/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/trbf8/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/trbf8,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

I collect data on seigneurial jurisdictions for ancien-regime Spain and document a negative relationship between having been a seigneurial town in the 18th century and current economic development. To shed light on the causal effect, I focus on the distribution of lordships in the former Kingdom of Granada after its conquest by the Catholic Monarchs, which can be considered as conditionally random. The results confirm the negative effect of lordship found for the whole country: towns that shortly after the conquest were granted to nobles are relatively poorer today. In addition, I explore the mechanisms of persistence, with the results pointing to lower state capacity as a main explanatory factor. This finding is consistent with an interpretation of seigneurial jurisdictions as a privatization of the local government, which has historically hindered the application of central government policies and lowered the state’s infrastructural capacity in former manorial towns.",TRUE,FALSE,Economic development|Local political institutions|Lordships|State capacity,2019-08-09T21:35:43.413377,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-09,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Economic History|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development,Daniel Oto-Peralías,2018,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/citation/,k8mzr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/gu79q/,gu79q,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d4c51d6272b140016eb97b7/,5d4c51d6272b140016eb97b7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/k8mzr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/k8mzr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/k8mzr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Increasingly appreciated by consumers, peasant heritage products offer small farmers promising opportunities for economic, social and territorial development. To identify the obstacles and levers of this complex, multi-scale and multi-stakeholder objective, an integrative conceptual framework is needed. We applied the panarchy conceptual framework to two cases of participatory research with small quinoa producers: a local fair in Chile and quinoa export production in Bolivia. In both cases, the ""commoning"" process was crucial both to bring stakeholders together inside their communities and to gain recognition for their productions outside and thus reach social and economic inclusion. Despite the difference in scale, the local fair and the export market shared a similar marketing strategy based on short value chains promoting quality products with high identity value. In these dynamics of biocultural heritage valorisation, the panarchical approach revealed the central place as well as the vulnerability of the community territory.

The negative health effects of unemployment are significant, and the potential for increased morbidity and mortality is a major public health challenge. Negative effects may be partially attributable to health behavior change and loss of social ties. Exercise has positive physical and mental health benefits and could help buffer such negative effects. This study examines whether time in social and solitary exercise varies by unemployment and out of the labor force (OOLF) status because exercise, especially social exercise, provides health benefits.
METHODS
Gender-stratified ordinary least squares models are estimated using data from the nationally representative 2003-2016 American Time Use Surveys to test how own and partner employment status are associated with total time in exercise, exercise alone, with children, with a partner, and with others.
RESULTS
Unemployed and OOLF men spend more time in exercise alone and with others compared to employed men. Unemployed women spend more time in exercise with others, and OOLF women in all types of social exercise, compared to employed women.
CONCLUSIONS
Unemployed and OOLF individuals engage in more social exercise, which could be leveraged to help buffer loss of social ties and improve health.

This contradicts the tenet that life expectancy is positively correlated with human welfare, but it coheres with recent literature on mortality and recessions. We construct Lee-Carter interval estimates of life expectancy during the Great Depression, based on trends before 1929. In this analysis, all-race life expectancy did not grow unusually during the Great Depression. However, nonwhites did see greater-than-expected increases in life expectancy in 1930-33.

It addresses recent calls to include actions and interventions which restrict citizenship in the context of illegalized migration within critical citizenship studies literature. Studying the state violence upholding and spatializing normative citizenship allows for a deeper understanding of citizenship’s implication in the European border regime, and raises questions on the concept’s continued application to theorizations of migrants’ political movements and spatial manifestations. The paper proposes anti-citizen politics as an alternative before arguing that the presence of this politics within the city’s squats and jungles, more than the physical occupations as such, is what the French state seeks to eradicate through acts of domicide. Working from empirical examples, the article describes a ‘carrot-and-stick’ domicide currently at work in Calais where the eviction and destruction of autonomous forms of migrant inhabitance is combined with a simultaneous offer of state managed accommodation. These tactics operate together to drive migrants out of the city of Calais, away from the UK border, and ultimately into a determination of their detain/deport-ability via citizenship’s scrutiny.",TRUE,FALSE,anti-citizenship|Calais|domicide|France|spatial inhabitance/segregation|technologies of citizenship,2019-09-04T02:46:04.963783,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d89|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Human Geography,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/citation/,vuw72,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ce458536cf5001a8ab07b/,5d6ce458536cf5001a8ab07b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vuw72/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vuw72/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vuw72,https://doi.org/10.1080/13621025.2019.1634422,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The traditional publishing model does not support public access (i.e., no publisher paywall barrier) to scholarly journals. Newer models of publishing allow free access to research including open access publishing and deposit of scholarship in institutional or disciplinary repositories. This study examined public access to articles in the top 25 social work journals. A random sample of article citations from a total of 1,587 was assessed, with the result that 52% of citations had no full-text access. Of the remaining 48% of citations with full-text access, it is questionable most will remain available long term due to possible copyright violations. Citations from the random sample show only minimal usage of institutional or disciplinary repositories as a means of sharing research. Establishing this baseline measure of access to research is an important first step in understanding the barriers for social workers in accessing research to inform practice.

It uses a mixed method approach, where the students’ essays were analyzed using systemic functional linguistics (SFL) in terms of the textual meta-function of cohesive devices. The five types of the cohesive devices are the following: lexical cohesion, reference, conjunction, substitutions, and ellipses. Moreover, each of their subcategories were analyzed in the students’ texts. The NVivo qualitative data analysis software and the corpus analysis (conducted using AntConc) were used to calculate the frequencies of each cohesive device found in the data. The IELTS writing assessment scale was also used to evaluate the students’ writing scores. The results show that the most frequently used device was lexical cohesion, specifically repetition. Saudi EFL undergraduate students tended to repeatedly stay focused on the central idea of the topic. Furthermore, Pearson’s correlation coefficient found a relationship between the students’ writing scores and length of their essays, the use of cohesive ties and the scores, and cohesive ties and the length of the students’ essays.

Existing research examines why active people “avoid” activist identities but has less to say about how active people adopt such identities as if they automatically follow participation. We draw on interviews with high school and college students from a midsize southwestern city to examine how young people make sense of what it means to be an activist, who identifies as such, and why youth are willing—or unwilling—to adopt this label. We find that respondents’ conceptualizations of “activists” are critical to (non)identification. Those who see activism as a broad category are more likely to identify, holding constant their level of activity.

In-depth analysis found the high-prestige group also advantageous in other network measures such as closeness centrality and eigenvector centrality, as well as the strength, persistence, and reciprocity of their ties. To probe potential explanations of the revealed gap, we further contrasted post content and posting behaviors between two groups. Results did not identify any significant differences in post content but found low-prestige students’ participation less timely and more temporally compressed.

In this framing, institutions of secondary socialization do not seek to socialize all candidates, nor do they seek to simply socialize viable candidates from various social backgrounds differently. Rather, powerful actors in these institutions determine the worthiness of candidates by evaluating whether those candidates engage in the work and social life of the institution. Those evaluations are shaped by race and social class distinctions, and perceptions of engagement are important for the candidate’s future successes.

social and commercial. While the measurement of commercial performance is
relatively straightforward and well understood, our understanding of the factors
related to measuring social performance is more ambiguous. Is the adoption of
social performance measurement (SPM) practices more related to external pressures, such as the need to demonstrate legitimacy to funders and peers, or is it more closely related to the growing rationalization within the social sector? We examine the relationship between external and internal factors and the adoption of SPM using a novel dataset of 1864 nascent social enterprises from around the world. Our findings suggest support for the argument that the adoption of SPM in social
enterprise is related to the growing rationalization of the social sector, which
challenges some of the past research on this topic, and provides a more nuanced
perspective of SPM in social enterprise.",TRUE,FALSE,impact measurement|legitimacy|performance measurement|rationalization|Social enterprise|social entrepreneurship|Social performance measurement,2019-06-26T10:08:02.848922,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-06-26,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/citation/,8wa5c,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/y3p4j/,y3p4j,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d0ec8fb65ffa5001c1def03/,5d0ec8fb65ffa5001c1def03,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8wa5c/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8wa5c/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8wa5c,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11266-017-9898-1,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of this article is to revisit three assumptions on the two main social policy options for the provision of social benefits to older persons. Each assumption is assessed through counterfactual reasoning using a combination of literature review and statistical analysis with a global perspective. The study finds that (i) 79 countries would be economically able to shift from targeted noncontributory pensions to basic universal noncontributory pensions with less than 1.2 per cent of the respective national gross domestic products; (ii) 16 countries have means‐tested/region‐tested noncontributory pensions more expensive than a hypothetical basic universal social pension; (iii) an arbitrary threshold of “economic development” is not a limitation for implementing social pensions; and (iv) at least 17 countries with relatively low economic development have successfully implemented social pensions without means targeting.

At the core of this debate is the question whether behavioural economics is shaped by large-scale content imports from psychology, or whether these transfers have been too selective to challenge dominant approaches in economics. This study contributes to the debate in analysing a variety of bibliographic data from the disciplinary boundary between economics and psychology. Two datasets from the boundary of behavioural economics and psychology are compared to sets of economic and psychology publications in quantifying the use of mathematics, the share of empirical contributions, the authors’ academic background, and their cross-citations via network analysis. In contrast to proposals made by some methodologists and behavioural economists, the statistical results confirm content transfers from psychology via behavioural economics only to a limited extend. The observed level of interaction provides evidence for a selective import of specific psychological findings by a small number of established investigators in behavioural economics.

Historians have discussed whether the individual assemblies in the sixteenth and seventeenth century could be seen as a consistent institution, what constituencies were represented there, what role they played in the relations of the Tsar with his subjects, and if they were similar to the early modern assemblies elsewhere. The growing historiographic consensus does not see the early modern Russian assemblies as an institution. In the nineteenth–early twentieth century, history writing and myth-making integrated the zemskii sobor into the argumentations of both the opponents and the proponents of parliamentarism in Russia. The autocratic mythology, perpetuated by the Slavophiles in the second half of the nineteenth century, proved more coherent yet did not achieve the recognition from the Tsars. The democratic mythology was more heterogeneous and, despite occasionally fading to the background of the debates, lasted for some hundred years between the 1820s and the 1920s. Initially, the autocratic approach to the zemskii sobor was idealistic, but it became more practical at the summit of its popularity during the Revolution of 1905–1907, when the zemskii sobor was discussed by the government as a way to avoid bigger concessions. Regionalist approaches to Russia’s past and future became formative for the democratic mythology of the zemskii sobor, which persisted as part of the romantic nationalist imagery well into the Russian Civil War of 1918–1922. The zemskii sobor came to represent a Russian constituent assembly, destined to mend the post-imperial crisis. The two mythologies converged in the Priamur Zemskii Sobor, which assembled in Vladivostok in 1922 and became the first assembly to include the term into its official name.",TRUE,FALSE,Assembly of the Land|intellectual history|liberalism|nationalism|regionalism|Russia|Slavophiles|Zemskii Sobor|Zemsky Sobor|Земский собор,2019-11-22T19:21:03.482739,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76cd1|Arts and Humanities|History|Intellectual History,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/citation/,bh8xg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd7e5cc215a8f000b4d1894/,5dd7e5cc215a8f000b4d1894,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bh8xg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bh8xg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bh8xg,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Mathematical models of social dynamics have been increasingly recognised as a powerful research tool in achieving this goal. Here, motivated by the fact that the dynamics of the ongoing Yellow Vest Movement in France exhibit anomalously long duration (currently it is in 30th week), we explore whether this can be a result of a dynamical systems phenomenon known as long transients. To this end, we build and study a hierarchy of mathematical models describing the ""population dynamics"" of the movement, i.e. how the number of protesters changes with time. We show that in these models long transients appear via two roots: via a ghost attractor and via an interaction of the slow and fast dynamics. We demonstrate that long transients are also present in some earlier models of social protests. Interestingly, our models predict that the Yellow Vest Movement should end abruptly by, at the latest, mid-summer 2019 without any interference from the French government. More generally, we argue that long transients are a generic feature of dynamical models describing social processes in the same way as they are in models of physical, ecological, and evolutionary systems.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-05-30T21:56:27.307806,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/citation/,tpyux,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cef5d732a50c400167fb73d/,5cef5d732a50c400167fb73d,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/tpyux/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/tpyux/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/tpyux,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

A number of outcomes associated with school belonging, including positive social relationships, perceptions of a fulfilling life, self-respect, optimism, and self-efficacy, are interlinked by the concept of socioemotional flourishing. This study aimed to assess the age-varying prevalence of and association between school belonging and flourishing among sexual or gender minority (SGM) and racial or ethnic minority (REM) students compared with non-minority students in the U.S. higher education setting. Data were drawn from a large national survey of U.S. college and university students ages 18–26, and were examined using varying-coefficient models to estimate the relation of school belonging and flourishing as a continuous function of age. SGM students (n = 6,718) had significantly lower belonging and flourishing than cisgender heterosexual students (n = 19,492) across all age points, and compared to white students (n= 16,444), REM students (n = 10,539) endorsed significantly lower belonging and flourishing at several age points. The association of belonging with flourishing was found to be significantly greater for SGM students than for cisgender heterosexual students across all ages, while age-varying associations for REM and white students were more complex. Findings of this study underline the unique importance and magnitude of the role of school belonging in socioemotional flourishing for SGM young adults, and highlight potential avenues for prevention of negative psychosocial and substance use outcomes among both SGM and REM college and university students.",TRUE,FALSE,flourishing|minority health|racial or ethnic minority|school belonging|sexual and gender minority,2019-11-21T17:11:01.893855,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|5a8c80f8c698300375c76da4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|Health Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e29|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sexualities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Mental Health|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e49|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sex and Gender,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/citation/,utncb,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3/,5ad7979bc69830002d8190e3,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd5be5b82d216000e530751/,5dd5be5b82d216000e530751,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/utncb/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/utncb/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/utncb,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
esgra,preprints,2019-08-24,2019-08-25,2019-08-25,NA,NA,United in Diversity? An Empirical Investigation on Europe's Regional Social Capital,"Aiming to explain the European divide with respect to social and political values, scholars in the past have relied on a simplified four- (or even two-) dimensional regime model which tranches the continent according to the social capacities of its inhabitants. This ""cartography"" of ""Social Europe"" proves to be outdated by the results presented in this study which re-measures the social capital landscape in Europe. In this work, we apply a factor analysis model to the most commonly used approximations of social capital on the European Social Survey.
In addition, we explore, as a novelty in social capital literature, a classification tree to model generalized trust. The analysis shows that three distinct dimensions of social capital measures are important in Europe: additionally to generalised social capital, which is usually approximated by generalised trust, there is one dimension of civic engagement and one of communitarian values. This distinction leads to a new social landscape of Europe, which highlights the relevance of considering regional and cross-border clusters in all relevant social capital dimensions.The results of the non-parametric model reveal that Protestantism and education are good benchmarks to classify trust on an individual level.

awfjt,preprints,2019-02-06,2020-07-09,2019-02-07,NA,NA,Estimating Treatment Heterogeneity of International Monetary Fund Programs on Child Poverty with Generalized Random Forest,"A flourishing group of scholars of family sociology study how macroeconomic shockwaves propagate via households dynamics and landing a blow on children’s living conditions; simultaneously, scholars of political economy unravel impacts of such shockwaves on population outcomes. Since these two strands of literature have evolved independently, little is know about the relative importance of societal and family features moderating this impact on children’s material living conditions. In this article, we synthesize insights from these two strands by examining the effect of economic austerity following International Monetary Fund programs—a type of economic shock—on child poverty across a sample representative of about half the world’s population of mainly the Global South. This article addresses the following fundamental sociological questions: to what extent do the pathways of economic austerity propagate through families’ living conditions and societies’ structural and political characteristics. To capture these multiple non-linear heterogeneous relationships between macro and micro traits, we deploy machine learning in the service of policy evaluation. First, our analysis identifies an adverse average treatment effect (ATE) following the implementation of IMF programs on children’s probability of falling into poverty: 0.14, 95% CI 0.03- 0.24. Second, our algorithms identify substantial impact heterogeneity distributed about this ATE. Macro constellation moderate about half of the impact variation on children, and families’ capabilities moderate the other half of this variation. We named this finding the 50-50 impact-moderation rule of thumb. Our algorithm identified family wealth closely followed by governments’ education spending as the critical moderating factors. IMF program affects children residing in the middle of the social stratification more than compared to their peers residing in both the top and bottom of this stratification; for those children residing in societies that have selected into IMF programs and have historically spent most on education, are at a higher risk of falling into poverty. These findings identify the value of combining family sociology and political economy perspectives.  Scholars will likely cross-fertilize this research further by testing this 50-50 rule of thumb to other types of economic shocks.",TRUE,FALSE,child poverty|economic crisis|family sociology|generalized random forest|global poverty|heterogeneous treatment effect|International Monetary Fund|machine learning|policy evaluation|public policy,2019-02-07T20:22:26.677650,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-07,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc8|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Growth and Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dce|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Public Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e30|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Global and Transnational Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e33|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awfjt/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awfjt/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awfjt/citation/,awfjt,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awfjt/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awfjt/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awfjt/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5b49c876653c001b2aa220/,5c5b49c876653c001b2aa220,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awfjt/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awfjt/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/awfjt/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/awfjt/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/awfjt,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The relation between theoretical development and computational analysis is discussed, and we argue for the value of null-findings and risky research in additive science. Subsequently, the (experimental) two-phase review process is described. In this process,  after the first double-blind review phase, an editor can signal that they intend to publish the article conditional on satisfactory revisions. This starts the second review phase, in which authors and reviewers are no longer required to be anonymous and the authors are encouraged to publish a preprint to their article which will be linked as working paper from the journal.

However, recently, Islamic financial institutions and markets have been emerging, which stand on the Shariah provision – the guided way to behave rationally or guided rationality. Based on the empirical experiences and evidences of both market systems, this paper discusses and compares the performances of the markets under the theoretical arguments of “rationality”, “quasi-rationality”, and “guided rationality”.

Many issues surrounding cognitive ability especially those related to heredity is highly charged. Yet, all of the discussion on heredity has been based on non-DNA evidence. It is largely neglected that DNA and environmental data at individual level are indispensable for understanding the development of cognitive ability. In this article, we report findings from a study that uses both ability-related polygenic scores (PGSs) and a rich set of socioeconomic measures from Add Health. In an all-ethnicity sample excluding blacks, a social-science model predicts verbal ability well yielding an R2 of 17.5%. Adding two ability-related PGSs increases this R2 by 1.7%. Such models yield more accurate estimates of the effects of the PGSs and those of SES context, and provide an estimated degree to which SES context is influenced by parental genomes. Schooling and neighborhood remain important to verbal ability even after an early measure of verbal ability is adjusted in the model. Although the influence from the genome is evident, the influences of SES context are critical and cannot be dismissed.",TRUE,FALSE,Add Health|cognitive ability|gene-environment interaction|genomics|polygenic score|verbal ability,2019-02-09T00:09:03.015170,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-09,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e21|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Evolution, Biology, and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e26|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Education|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e35|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Inequality, Poverty, and Mobility|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e50|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Other Sociology",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/citation/,gz7er,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c5e0e1376653c0018271959/,5c5e0e1376653c0018271959,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/gz7er/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gz7er/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/gz7er,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The purpose of the article is to give a comparative analysis of teaching general English and English for special purposes, to present arguments with respect to approaches designed to organize and ensure the high efficiency of mastering English for special purposes. The study focuses on comparative methods of studying different training programs in order to set out the results of a success study of different students groups. The authors substantiated the necessity of using the basic methodology of teaching a foreign language for special purposes with a higher efficiency of the personality-oriented approach as a basis for teaching ESP. The results of the research proved that the development of the program depends on the analysis of the needs of the learning group and the actual situations of using the language for special purposes. For teaching the EGP course, students have a common standard goal of learning English, which does not always correspond to the language needs of the students. The line of demarcation between the courses of EGP and ESP has become very important, but requires the further discussion. The approaches described in our study combine the study of subject discipline and a foreign language as a tool for mastering subject knowledge is the essence of European Union (EU) policy.

Adopting children out of the household can, however, also be seen as a strategy for dealing with excess children. This topic is the focus of our article, which investigates who was given away for adoption and why in Taiwan during the period 1906-1940. The Taiwan Historical Household Register Database (THHRD), which can take changing household composition over time into account, is analysed using univariate and Cox proportional-hazard analyses. Results demonstrate that gender, birth position among siblings of the same sex, and variation across place and time are the most important factors explaining the likelihood of being adopted for all children. Socio-economic position also played an important role and the presence of a grandfather and grandmother lowered the likelihood of being adopted especially for boys, while only the presence of a grandmother had the same effect for girls. Moreover, when looking more specifically at adoption risks for girls, the age, gender and adoption status of siblings in the household seem to matter as well, as similarly aged young siblings of either sex increased the likelihood of being adopted for girls. These findings underscore that household decision making regarding adoption is more complex than simply giving away later-born children and that it is important to also pay more attention to the reasons and motivation of households in giving away children for adoption. It provides a broader perspective on adoption practices and how children were circulated from households with too many to those with too few and how this benefitted both kinds.",TRUE,FALSE,Adoption|Birth Order|Chinese Family|little daughter-in-law|simpua|Taiwan,2019-11-08T19:33:44.296839,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-08,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccc|5a8c80f4c698300375c76ccf|Arts and Humanities|History|Asian History,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/citation/,4jb3u,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc3d370bb21c7000c883464/,5dc3d370bb21c7000c883464,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/4jb3u/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/4jb3u/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/4jb3u,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Past research shows benefits from spending time in green spaces, including improved well-being, as well as better mental and physical health (van den Berg et al. 2010; Atuoye et al. 2019; Bingley 2013). However, these studies focus on spending time in parks, gardens, or other natural environments and build their cases around the advantageous effects resulting from actual time spent in such places (Fan, Das, and Chen 2011; Litt et al. 2015; van den Berg et al. 2010). This study focuses instead on whether exposure to, regardless of time spent in green spaces, has similar effects. Using attention restoration theory and the theory of therapeutic landscapes, I hypothesize that the more one agrees that they have access to or views of natural environments, the fewer days of poor mental health they will have. This study uses data from the 2018 General Social Survey, with a restricted sample of only those who are employed or temporarily not working (N = 649). After controlling for race, family income, full-time employment status, size of place, and dwelling type, results show no significant relationship between access to or views of natural environments and days of poor mental health. However, multivariate results show that controlling for all other factors, white individuals had more days of poor mental health, and those who work full-time, live in single-family detached homes, or have higher family incomes had fewer days of poor mental health.

Our argument is that these two forms of critique are systematically opposed to each other: They are based on opposing epistemic premises, they are motivated by opposing political concerns, and they pursue opposing visions of social progress.

However, only a few studies applied a longitudinal and dynamic perspective on how intergenerational mobility shapes graduates’ working careers. Using multilevel growth curve modelling and data from the 1970 British cohort study (BCS70), we contribute to this research by looking at the emergence of social inequalities during the first ten years since labour market entry. We further distinguish between graduates of different fields of study as we expect social disparities to develop differently due to differences in initial occupational placement and upward mobility processes. We find that parental class does not affect occupational prestige over and above prior achievement. Separate analyses by the field of study show that initial differences in occupational prestige and career progression do not differ between graduates from different classes of origin in STEM fields and arts and humanities. It is only in the social sciences that working class graduates start with lower occupational prestige but soon catch up with their peers from higher classes.

Trump’s faciality opens up possibilities of authoritarian micropolitics around a messenger/disrupter in chief. It works in connection with a landscape and relative to a
collective assemblage of enunciation that extracted a territory of perception and affect.

Many design methods operationalize this understanding through the use of cultural markers or predefined cultural dimensions. Here, we take a first step to distil the culturally specific values of the Saudi culture.

We theorize and show empirically how concurrency affects electoral outcomes. First, concurrency increases turnout and thereby the participation of peripheral voters. Second, in combined elections, one electoral arena affects the other. In our case of majoritarian executive elections concurrent to proportional representation (PR) legislative elections, the centripetal tendency of majoritarian elections colors off to the concurrent PR race. Third, concurrency also entails spillovers of the incumbency advantage of executive officeholders to the concurrent legislative race. Drawing on quasi-random variation in local election timing in Germany, we show that concurrency increases turnout as well as council votes for the incumbent mayor’s party and centrist parties more generally, with slightly more pronounced gains for the political left.

This study uses the Cox proportional hazard model to show mutually-exclusive patterns between homeownership and childbearing. The results suggest that either short-term rent or home-ownership is negative to have a first child while only home-ownership is negative to have a second child. Also, rural areas show a slightly faster path in having a second child.

Here, we document the indigenous knowledge of the Sheka community in southwestern Ethiopia on stingless bees. We used the snowball sampling technique to locate 60 experienced honey collectors, conducted semi-structured interviews, and complemented interviews with field observations during honey collection trips with interviewees. Honey collectors did not collect honey from aboveground nesting stingless bees, but only from stingless bees nesting belowground. To find the underground nests in the field, honey collectors used several methods, including direct observation of nest entrances and worker bee movement, attaching a thread to the worker bee, and listening for the humming sound of the bee’s natural enemy (wasp). Nests were harvested destructively. Interestingly, a single farmer kept ground-nesting stingless bee colonies at his backyard using uniquely tailored squared box hives. Collected honey is used for home consumption, disease treatment, and the generation of income. Our findings illustrate the deep indigenous knowledge of the Sheka community on wild ground-nesting stingless bees. To facilitate the establishment of stingless bee beekeeping (meliponiculture) in the study area, we may build upon this indigenous knowledge by field research on the biology of stingless bees, taxonomic studies to assess the diversity and identity of ground-nesting stingless bees, and engineering studies to develop beekeeping practices.

that resemble traditional editorial decisions. However, the decisions for social media may
deviate from traditional ones because they are often made outside the newsroom and guided
by audience metrics. This study focuses on selective link sharing as quasi-gatekeeping on
Twitter – conditioning a link sharing decision about news content. It illustrates how selective
link sharing resembles and deviates from gatekeeping for the publication of news stories.
Using a computational data collection method and a machine learning technique called
Structural Topic Model (STM), this study shows that selective link sharing generates a
different topic distribution between news websites and Twitter and thus significantly revokes
the specialty of news organizations. This finding implies that emergent logic, which governs
news organizations’ decisions for social media can undermine the provision of diverse news,

A Study of Satisfaction with the Work–Family Balance among Part-Time Service Sector Employees in Five Western European Countries,"Working part-time is frequently considered a viable strategy for employees to better combine work and non-work responsibilities. The present study examines differences in satisfaction with work-family balance (SWFB) among professional and non-professional part-time service sector employees in five western European countries. Part-time employees were found to be more SWFB than full-time employees even after taking varying demands and resources into account. However, there are important differences among the part-timers.

UCCities Working Paper # 1,"While many urban scholars acknowledge the importance of justice and participation for emerging smart city initiatives, these dimensions remain inadequately addressed in critical literature. To strengthen the smart city critique, in this conceptual intervention we employ the theory of justice developed by philosopher Nancy Fraser, organized along the domains of redistribution, recognition, and representation. Using Fraser’s tripartite framework of justice, we reformulate and expand the existing critiques of the smart city.

METHOD: A grid comparing bioethic stances for the major world religions was created (https://goo.gl/ZpwJL7).  The consensus, or lack thereof, within each religious group is displayed in the grid as a color coded heatmap.  An online quiz (http://bit.ly/2017ethics1) was also created and tested as an educational resource by administered the quiz twice to four years of medical students at Marian University.  The open access online quiz resource emails users personalized results comparing their last score to their prior attempts, against other quiz takers at their institution, and against an average of all quiz takers across institutions.  RESULTS: User demographics were analyzed and their knowledge of religions bioethical stances was determined to not be affected by age or sex, but was found to improve as they progressed through medical school.  There was greater variance between ethical questions than there was between quiz takers for each ethical issue, highlighting specific biomedical ethical issues that may benefit from increased educational time in curricula.  There also appeared to be differences based on the quiz takers religious background but the sample size for most backgrounds was too small to extrapolate the results to a wider population.

Statistical Probability and the Rise of the Novel,"Literary scholars in the information age, whatever issues we may differ on, have long shared a belief that the amount of ""information"" in literary language is not a phenomenon that can be empirically investigated. We tell our students, and remind each other, that the meaning in literary texts is inherently subjective, culture-specific, and contextual rather than fixed. Scholar Katherine Bode reaffirms this article of faith in a new book on digital literary methodology, writing that ""literary data are inevitably constructed and transactional, whether they are explicitly designated so or not."" Long prose forms such as the novel seem especially immune to empirical assessment. As Thomas Pavel notes, the wide-open form of the novel allows ""for any imaginable kind of confabulation without constraint,"" while the fact that each reader can reinterpret and recontextualize a novel anew seems to guarantee that the meanings latent in such texts can never be fully described, much less quantified. Probably because both digital and traditional humanists hold these beliefs, most data mining, topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and other distant reading methods used on fiction search for subtle patterns or relative thematic trends across time, or for faint signals of style detectable in genres or the works of individual writers.

This is a significant omission given that disability severely limits opportunities and contributes to cumulative disadvantage. We draw from feminist disability and intersectional theories to account for how disability intersects with gender, race, and education to produce economic insecurity. The findings from our analyses of 2015 American Community Survey data provide strong empirical support for hierarchies of disadvantage, where women and racial minority groups with disabilities and less education experience the highest poverty levels, report the lowest total income, and have a greater reliance on sources outside the labor market for economic security.

The intervention includes arousal-regulation, multiple sensory processing, conceptualization, affective mentalization and associative memory formation (active learning). Autism Spectrum Disorder is a clinical diagnosis for a heterogeneous group of individuals who experience pervasive neurodevelopmental problems including perceiving the world in a fragmented way: the pre-conceptual state of mind. Tailored ReAttach sessions support individuals with ASD to develop a coherent sense of the self and the world.
Objective: The aim of this article is to describe how a to tailor a ReAttach session to the individual state of mind of individuals with ASD.
Method: ReAttach-C.A.T. is a Computer Adaptive Tool, built to assist therapists to map the individual state of mind before the start of ReAttach sessions. The instrument is in its early stage of development.
Results: A group of 52 patients with complex developmental challenges were interviewed by their ReAttach therapist, using the inclusive ReAttach-C.A.T.

This study addresses an extreme case of exclusion, urban expulsions of Jews in the medieval western Holy Roman Empire. Expulsions were official edicts proclaimed by Christian princes, lords, or town councils, whomever ruled a territory. Changing religious and political culture, in the form of new value on community righteousness and the beginning of territorialization, provided incentives for polities to expel their Jewish residents. Using a new database of Jewish settlement and city development in the Western Holy Roman Empire 1000-1520 CE, I show that the relational structure of political power between Christian elites could insulate or expose Jewish communities to political contests of the time. Jews were derided, lesser members of Christian society, but in spite of increasing focus on Christian piety and legislating community purity, most cities did not expel their Jewish residents.

In the aftermaths of ‘the bloody decade’, Algeria lost the pillars of its tertiary education. To compensate, the government relied on mass access to universities which has in its turn resulted in low quality. This work seeks to check the usability of the human capital approach in solving the quality problem in Algerian universities. Because education could offer both monetary and non-monetary profits, it is considered lucrative to invest in developing human skills and competences which constitute the capital that guarantees earning a living. This research, thus, proposes ‘academic advising’ as a first step on the short term. The current paper presents a descriptive analysis of 50 questionnaires answered by middle and high school teachers and headmasters, university students and professors and guidance counselors. The results of this qualitative study show how ‘academic advising’ when extended up to the university level can harness the learner’s capital.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic advising|Algerian higher education|quality|the human capital approach,2019-07-19T19:24:07.431762,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/citation/,ycrbf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cf9dfc389c9830018bcd6a0/,5cf9dfc389c9830018bcd6a0,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ycrbf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ycrbf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ycrbf,https://doi.org/10.24093/awej/Chief1.4,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Despite its critical importance, it curiously remains poorly understood in a number of dimensions. In order to address this, we have analysed peer review to assess where the major gaps in our theoretical and empirical understanding of it lie. We identify core themes including editorial responsibility, the subjectivity and bias of reviewers, the function and quality of peer review, and the social and epistemic implications of peer review. The high-priority gaps are focused around increased accountability and justification in decision making processes for editors, and developing a deeper, empirical understanding of the social impact of peer review. Addressing this at the bare minimum will require the design of a consensus for a minimal set of standards for what constitutes peer review, and the development of a shared data infrastructure to support this. Such a field requires sustained funding and commitment from publishers and research funders, who both have a commitment to uphold the integrity of the published scholarly record.

We analyze a game-theoretic model that shows how the threat of corruption affects the incentives of non-corrupt politicians to enlist the help of lobbyists to make more informed decisions. Politicians face a dilemma because voters cannot always tell whether a politician allows access to lobbyists in order to solicit corruption or to seek information. Thus, a non-corrupt politician may deny access to lobbyists to signal that she is non-corrupt even though doing so impedes her ability to make good policy.

I sketch the broad outlines of a nuanced theoretical approach for analyzing the law-family relationship, which insists that the relationship entails a contingent and dynamic interplay between relatively powerful regulating institutions and relatively powerless regulated populations.

This study analyzes disparities in attainment of affordable housing between white, black, Hispanic, and Asian households using 2005-2017 American Community Survey microdata linked to county-level ACS 5-year estimates. I test hypotheses regarding the overall disparities between ethnoracial groups, potential limited returns on socioeconomic status and acculturation characteristics for black, Hispanic, and Asian households relative to white households, and the positive effects of high coethnic populations within the county of residence. Results show there are significant gaps between whites and the other groups regarding their attainment of affordable housing throughout the study period. Differential returns on socioeconomic status are also present, with Hispanics and Asians receiving lesser returns on education relative to whites. Hispanics received significant benefits regarding immigrant status compared to other ethnoracial groups. When accounting for county-level ethnoracial composition there is clear evidence that black, Hispanic, and Asian households are more likely to benefit than white households if they live in a county with an increased coethnic population. However, all groups become less likely overall to live in affordable housing as a county’s percentage white decreases suggesting that ethnoracial composition affects both the overall attainment of affordable housing for all groups and the relative disparities between groups within counties.",TRUE,FALSE,Affordable Housing|Ethnicity|Race|Residential Attinment|United States,2019-05-14T12:59:28.633639,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e25|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Community and Urban Sociology,Matthew M.

Previous studies report conflicting evidence: some find that gender-diverse firms experience more positive performance and others find the opposite. However, most research to date has focused on a single country or industry and has not accounted for possible variation across social contexts. This paper advances an institutional framework and predicts that gender diversity’s relationship with performance depends on both its normative and regulatory acceptance in the broader institutional environment. Using a unique longitudinal sample of 1,069 leading public firms around the world, I find that the relationship between gender diversity and firm performance varies significantly across countries and industries due to differences in institutional context. The more gender diversity has been normatively accepted in a country or industry, the more gender-diverse firms experience positive market valuation and increased revenue. These findings underscore the importance of the broader social context when considering the relationship between gender diversity and firm performance.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-09-29T21:35:02.232097,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-29,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e1f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Organization Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e38|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Organizations, Occupations, and Work",Letian Zhang,2020,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/citation/,8792m,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d90d1a5c43280001dc8585f/,5d90d1a5c43280001dc8585f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8792m/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8792m/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8792m,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

However, game-theoretic and institutional models suggest that cooperatives may be inherently fragile due to the individual costs of cooperation. Because of this it is widely believed that organizations which rely less on cooperation may be more stable, while organizations that require cooperation may be at higher risk of folding. Therefore, if cooperatively owned or managed businesses do in fact require higher levels of prosocial and cooperative behavior than hierarchically managed firms, they must attract and maintain cooperation among participants in order to function. We hypothesized that successful consumer food cooperatives will exhibit greater generalized cooperation than conventional grocery stores. We employed an experimental dictator game to measure altruistic cooperation among consumers at a food cooperative and a comparable conventional grocery. Cooperative customers exhibit a higher base rate of cooperation than similar conventional food shoppers, and this relationship holds even when taking demographic factors such as income, education, and age into account.

Associate member groups offered congregations a new way to extend the reach of their respective missions and charisms, while deepening the relationships with lay women and men who partnered with them in ministry.

In this paper, I explore the relatively recent history of associate groups and how these organizations have and continue to work with their sponsoring congregations. I use data from the Center for Applied Research in the Apostolate (CARA)—commissioned recently by the North American Conference of Associates and Religious (NACAR)—to look at demographic trends among women religious and associates. I describe how religious communities incorporate associates into their organizational decision-making, and how certain internal processes—like general chapters—are now open to associate members.

Overall, I submit that given the declining numbers of sisters and aging populations of many religious communities, associate groups have the potential to provide opportunities to conceptualize new forms of religious life in the Catholic Church. Finally, I argue that associate groups also have the important role of increasing gender, racial, and class diversity among communities of women religious, and that this diversity may lead to a more inclusive and democratizing corporate structure for women’s religious congregations in the 21st century.",TRUE,FALSE,Clergy|Gender|Nuns|Religiosity|Religious Life|Sociology of Religion|Spirituality|Women Religious,2019-07-25T10:03:21.904044,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-25,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e31|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Sociology of Religion,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/citation/,we627,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d385f09a667db001afa2f0b/,5d385f09a667db001afa2f0b,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/we627/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/we627/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/we627,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

In this project, we wanted to assign OA tags to publications in KB database. We queried KB in-house database up to 2017 (including Web of Science (WOS) and Scopus) for all articles and reviews. We then matched the corresponding DOIs to three sources of OA information: Unpaywall, Crossref and Bielefeld list of gold OA journals. This allowed us to define the OA status for publications. We found close to 14 million publications (articles and reviews between 2000 and 2016) from WOS (69.75% of all) and close to 18 million from Scopus (68.67% of all) with an equivalent DOI in Unpaywall. We matched KB publications database with Crossref data (from April 2018) and found 53 distinct licence URLs, which define in many cases the legally binding access status of publications. We found that more than half a million publications have more than one licence record in Crossref (in contrast to near 8 million with only one record and more than 6 million without a licence URL). We evaluated if these licences were open or closed access. We also matched respective journal ISSNs with DOAJ and ROAD databases and presented a categorization of publications to Gold, Hidden Gold, Hybrid and Delayed OA accounting for uncertainty due to missing licence information via a new sub-category Probable Hybrid OA. We validate our findings via manual checks and a crosscheck of OA information from the aforementioned varying sources.

How extent of meat restriction impacts individual dietary experience,"There are a variety of approaches to addressing meat overconsumption including forms of meat restriction that vary by the degree of reductions and the type of meat reduced. This study examines three such diets—a vegetarian diet, a reduced-meat diet, and a chicken-free diet—with a focus on the differences in the lived dietary experiences of their adherents. These lived experiences are operationalized using a variety of measures: satisfaction with food-related life, social ties, convenience, social/personal life, health, cost, motivation, identity, perception of prevalence rates, length of diet adherence, and the theory of planned behavior (intentions, attitudes, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norms). The data comes from an online survey of a cross-sectional, census-balanced sample of more than 30,0000 U.S. residents aged 18+ years sourced from Nielsen’s Harris Panel. The results showed meat reducers to be a larger group than previously suspected, with a third of American adults self-identifying as reducing their meat consumption, compared to one percent each who identify as a vegetarian or chicken avoider. The findings also demonstrated that a vegetarian diet had the strongest lived dietary experiences among American adults who are currently eating one of the meat-restricted diets.

This mixed-methods study aimed at examining the effects of the blended learning approach on Jordanian EFL learners’ grammar performance. The study also aimed at investigating the attitudes of Jordanian EFL learners toward blended learning. To achieve the objectives of the study, it employed a quasi-experimental design (pre and posttests) followed by qualitative interviews. The participants were divided into two groups: experimental and control groups. Among the 28 students in the sample, those in the experimental blended learning group (n=13) were taught using Moodle while those in the control group (n=15) were taught using conventional methods. All the 13 participants in the experimental group were interviewed. The results of the posttest revealed that students in the experimental group outperformed students in the control group. Furthermore, the qualitative analysis results showed that blended learning had a positive impact on the learners’ English grammar performance and that they were strongly satisfied and motivated to learn English using similar methods.

Observing the very limited rate of use of English in the Algerian community, English as Foreign Language (EFL) students, actually, need to progress in the mastery of that language by reading and/or listening to texts or messages intensively. To achieve this goal, subsequent procedures should take place by giving the foreign language a rather more appreciable position in the community such as the one held by a second language. To be down-to-earth, a brief survey on the linguistic situation in Algeria is exposed where neat clarification of second-foreign language status in the community is laid out to show that the more a (foreign) language is explicitly exposed in its manifold forms, the more are learners, in that community, likely to acquire it as a second language. However, the assumption of presenting the receptive skills (reading and listening) as the most appropriate means for the growth of foreign language vocabulary is supported by Krashen’s input theory where any input to be understood, should come at EFL learners’ capacity to read/listen and decode easily the meaning. In due course, First year EFL students have been subject to a language proficiency test-‘a pre-test then a post-test’. This typical experimental design is an intervention study which contains two groups: ‘the treatment or experimental’ group which receives the treatment, or which is exposed to some special conditions of intensifying vocabulary learning through a varied, comprehensible input; and a second group of EFL learners- the control group- whose role is to provide a baseline. The findings showed better scores among the experimental group compared to the other group.

Comparing co-authorships and acknowledgements in political science journals from Germany,"Scientific research on academic collaboration focuses on co-authorships, citations and acknowledgements as ‘reward triangle’. However, acknowledgements have received comparatively little attention. In this paper, we compare co-authorship and acknowledgement networks and investigate conditions that influence their formation (gender, institutional affiliation and status of authors and acknowledged individuals). We select three sub-disciplinary political science journals from Germany between 2010 and 2017. We employ techniques from social network analysis to compare these conditions by using homophily measures. The results demonstrate that co-authorships have a rather sparse network while including acknowledgements reveals hidden collaboration structures. Moreover, scholars from the same institution are more likely to co-author and acknowledge each other while we show heterophily effects for acknowledging and co-authoring behavior of professors. We also identify an underrepresentation of female academics as authors and credit-givers alike. Thus, our exploratory study reveals similarities and differences patterns for co-authorships and acknowledgements providing new ground for future studies on all aspects of collaborative behavior in science.",TRUE,FALSE,Academic collaboration|acknowledgements|co-authorship|Germany|political science|social network analysis,2019-07-14T23:06:47.008316,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-07-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e34|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Communication, Information Technologies, and Media Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/citation/,bg4qz,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d2b73fd1c5b4a001ca08286/,5d2b73fd1c5b4a001ca08286,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/bg4qz/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/bg4qz/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/bg4qz,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Assuming a temporally unidirectional environment, our theory describes an intelligent agent as one who aims to perform intelligent acts. The intelligent act is an ongoing attempt made by an agent to predict the future of the self as well as the future of the part or whole of the entire environment. However, the outcome is always uncertain. Our theory categorizes human behavior into intelligent and non-intelligent actions. 
Applying this categorization on literary texts enables us to continuously portray characters as intelligent or non-intelligent entities based on their actions. This approach helps redefine the way we perceive agency in characters’ progression. By investigating depictions of uncertainties in characters, we consider characters as entities who are able to rupture conventions governing the need for character coherence and narrative closure in literary texts. Therefore, we hope that readers will be able to accept stories that are not only at odds with the characters themselves but also with the readers.",TRUE,FALSE,characterization|intelligence|intelligent act|prediction|uncertainty,2019-02-21T00:05:08.155872,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-02-21,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f2c698300375c76c7d|5a8c80f5c698300375c76d10|Arts and Humanities|English Language and Literature|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/citation/,g78mf,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c6ddcd262c82a0018d71f6c/,5c6ddcd262c82a0018d71f6c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g78mf/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g78mf/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g78mf,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The analysis specifically covers the works of professors Stefan Solskyi, Kharysym Orda, Nikolai Drozdov, Afanasii Bulgakov, Mykola Makkaveiskyi, Vasylii Pevnytskyi, Arsenii Tsarevskyi, Volodymyr Rybinskyi, Dmytro Bohdashevskyi, and Aleksandr Glagolev. The author uses the metaphor of the Biblical world to describe the historically developed spiritual and cultural component of the European world, for which the Bible played the role of a normative and symbolic core. Affiliation with the Biblical world — as a way of broad social application of the Bible and assimilation of the norms and public behaviors sanctioned by this text — was and still is a stable symbolic marker as well as a cultural and ideological factor of integration with European civilization. The historical panorama of the reception of Biblical knowledge and the inculturation of Biblical morality by Christianized nations, reproduced in the writings of Kyiv academics, is presented as a field of centuries-old intercultural contacts and active inter-confessional interaction, and as an important ideological and moral factor of the socio-political integration and development of civil society. The issues addressed by Biblical studies in Europe and the rest of the world and considerations and solutions prompted by these issues proved to be fruitful for both the academic research and public practices in which academics of the Kyiv Theological Academy were engaged. The past and modern foreign experience related to the inculturation of the Bible was interpreted by the Kyiv researchers in the local context, more specifically, in the modernization attempts of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Therefore, the reflection of European and worldwide experience, though not fully implemented, was productive and was a potential factor that could have contributed to the European modernization of Kyiv cultural and religious life of the time and its integration into the global Biblical World.

This study gives evidence that trust in government organisations diminishes in an environment of high inequality. With the introduction of a subjective measure of how individuals perceive income inequality, past limitations in quantifying the underlying mechanism between inequality and trust are addressed. A significant negative association between perceived inequality and trust in political institutions, like the government and the EU, is found using a sample of 27 European countries.

Such discussion relates to a debate about the production mode 1, in which basic knowledge is produced irrespective of industry-oriented applications, and the production mode 2, in which knowledge is produced in the context of industry-oriented applications.
In the literature review, a discussion on the New Legal Landmark for ST&amp;I and the National System of Science, Technology and Innovation (NSSTI) relates these themes to the Triple Helix Approach – interaction among university, industry and government. In addition, a discussion on the typologies of academic entrepreneurship and the concept of academic hybridity was carried out, by means of the analysis of how such configurations influence how scholars view the ways of producing, diffusing and commercializing knowledge. This study consists of a qualitative research, of an exploratory character, which is oriented by phenomenology and hermeneutics, and applies the snowball sampling technique for recruiting the interviewees. The subjects of this research consisted of 15 scholars from two public universities of the state of Rio de Janeiro, who somehow perform or have tried to perform academic entrepreneurship activities and/or self-identify as entrepreneurs, according to their cognitive representations of the phenomenon. Such individuals have been named hybrid life individuals. We opted for carrying out in-depth conversational semi-structured interviews as a data collection technique. The research was guided by the following guiding question: how do the hybrid life individuals relate to the new paradigms, tendencies and regulations that promote a greater interaction among university, industry and government at the Brazilian public universities? This central question was supported by three accessory questions: a) how do the so-called hybrid life individuals perceive of and describe their experiences as academic entrepreneurs?; b) what are the barriers that impede the interaction university-industry-government from the perspective of the hybrid life individual?; c) how do the so-called hybrid life individuals view the influence of the New Legal Landmark for Science, Technology and Innovation in their activities? In the analysis and discussion of the research results, we demonstrated the path taken by the interviewees in search for answers. The most relevant conclusions of this research provide some possible clues regarding the multiple and plural ways in the process of production, diffusion and commercialization of knowledge. These clues also point that, despite the advances, there are still barriers for the interaction among university, industry and government. It was also observed that the possibilities for implementing and operationalizing the New Legal Landmark will depend on the adherence by the legal operators and academic scientists to the new regulations.",TRUE,FALSE,academic entrepreneurship|academic hybridity|entrepreneur university|Triple Helix approach,2019-05-31T09:34:51.280752,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-05-31,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f6c698300375c76d4e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d7a|Education|Teacher Education and Professional Development|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies,No,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/citation/,g6ukw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e965,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5ced79af2a50c4001980be6e/,5ced79af2a50c4001980be6e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/g6ukw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/g6ukw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/g6ukw,https://doi.org/10.22409/PPGAd.2019.m.01656969742,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Methods:  Data is baseline data from an evaluation of Talking Parents, Healthy Teens, a multi-session worksite-based parenting program.  Participants are 569 parents of 6-10th grades who responded to an advertisement posted in their workplace, and their 6-10th grade children (n=683): 683 parent-child dyads.  Self-administered survey data were collected in Southern California from 2002-2004.  We compare parent and child responses to 68 items about their relationships and communication about sex, and computed polychoric correlation (PCC), an agreement measure that corrects for possible parent-child differences in response threshholds, across dyads and across items.  Factors associated with higher agreement were found through bivariate comparison of PCC; linear regression on intra-dyad PCC; and linear regression on raw bias.

Results:  After adjusting for possible parent-child differences in response threshholds, PCC for items were low, with median 0.34 (inter-quartile range (IQR) (0.22, 0.41)).  Agreement was higher for sexual discussion topics (median 0.41 (IQR (0.37, 0.46))) than other items (Wilcoxon p&lt;0.001); in general, agreement was higher for factual than emotionally negative or hypothetical items.  PCC for dyads was very high, with median 0.87 (IQR (0.84, 0.91)), but left-skewed (skewness = -3.1).  Factors associated with greater parent-child agreement include younger child age, better parenting skills, parent married or living as married, and parent recollection of good communication with their own parents.  Agreement was not associated with socioeconomic factors.
Conclusions:  Survey-response discordance appears not to be solely attributable to response bias.  Items about concrete events yield better agreement than hypothetical items.  Response discordance may be partially attributable to different parent and child perceptions of their relationship because less discordance is evidence among parents with good parenting skills or who recall good communication with their own parents.",TRUE,FALSE,agreement; polychoric correlation; sex education; adolescents; parents; parent-adolescent communication,2019-03-30T14:38:26.931871,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e47|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Children and Youth|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Family,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/citation/,98kz4,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c9f37630a13d7001a8a1f6c/,5c9f37630a13d7001a8a1f6c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/98kz4/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/98kz4/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/98kz4,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2006.11.080,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

How the system ought to be changed, however, remains unclear. This paper briefly reviews candidate models for electoral reform from other nations, before putting forward the parsimonious mixed-member (PMM) model. This model was inspired by the mixed-member (MM) proportional representation system, as currently used in, for example, Germany. It is 'parsimonious', however, in the sense that the number of additional MPs brought into parliament to reach proportionality is minimized. Like traditional MM, PMM preserves the individual relationship between every voter and an MP, and it eliminates under-representation of parties. Unlike traditional MM, however, it also preserves the incentive for parties to win local races, it avoids unnecessary dilution of constituency representatives, and it avoids misattributing spoiled ballots to major parties. As such, it can be thought of as an optimization of MM. A key feature of this model is conservatism -it modifies our existing system with the minimal set of changes necessary to resolve the most obvious problems in the current system, without creating new ones.

tj4yk,preprints,2019-05-07,2019-05-07,2019-05-07,NA,NA,Inclusive STEM Education: Theoretical Framework for Examining the Experienes of Women Students of Color in STEM Education,"Women students of color (WSOC) continue to be excluded from science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, despite efforts to promote diversity. The existing research to develop inclusive STEM education adopts a deficit approach and fails to address the intersectionality of gender, race and class. By not addressing this intersectionality, research has failed to consider the effects of racial privilege for white women and the unique experiences of each woman of color. In contrast, my research will take an anti- deficit approach and value the intersectionality of each student. The objective of this study is to examine the experiences of WSOC in their secondary STEM education according to the intersection of race, gender and class. This research is also guided by the following questions: (1) What are WSOC’s social and academic experiences of STEM-related courses, and in-class and extracurricular activities? (2) What support systems and barriers do WSOC recognize in their schools pertaining to STEM, if any? (3) How are their experience, support systems and barriers unique yet similar according to their intersectionality? This paper develops the theoretical approach that guides my research. To better understand how WSOC are racialized and gendered in the settler state, I adopt Critical Race Theory (CRT) approach.

They make reference to an array of potentially harmful exposures occurring from birth to eighteen years of age and may be involved in the construction of health inequalities over the lifecourse. As with many simplified concepts, ACEs present limitations. They include diverse types of exposures, are often considered cumulatively, can be identified using prospective and retrospective approaches, and their multidimensional nature may lead to greater measurement error. From a public health perspective, ACEs are useful for describing the need to act upon complex social environments to prevent health inequalities at a population level. As the ACEs concept becomes popular in the context of policy interventions, concerns have emerged. As a probabilistic and population-level tool, it is not adapted to diagnose individual-level vulnerabilities, an approach which could ultimately exacerbate inequalities.

Yet, to attain such skills, teachers need to reshape their teaching practices to be in conformity with the principles of modern education that champion active learning methodologies. The present paper argues for the necessity of rethinking the traditional teacher-centered methods in teaching English literature in the Algerian context as they tend to reduce students’ active participatory roles in learning. In response to this, a number of suggestions have accordingly been put forward to enable students reach more independency in dealing with literature.

The city became a focal point of intensive intellectual debate whose participants regarded Kyiv not only as a place of a recent battleground but also as a sacral place and a highly symbolic image. Within the methodological framework of ethnic symbolism, this study attempts to explain how this physical/symbolic dichotomy was used to reinforce continuing claims for historical origin and cultural heritage, thus serving the contemporary purpose of national identity and political legitimacy. It also deploys the concept of displacement as a complex process of negotiation between homeland and hostland within an émigré community — whose sense of loss and identity crisis creates additional impetus, though in different forms, for exploiting historical narratives.

The mass pilgrimage movement transformed the place into an open air museum, a space that preserves the remnants of Soviet culture, revealing human tragedies of displacement and deaths, and the nature of state nuclear power. This study examines the impact of the site on its visitors and the motivations for their persistence and activities in the Zone, and argues that through photography, cartography, exploration, and discovery, the pilgrims attempt to decode the historical and ideological meaning of Chornobyl and its significance for future generations. Ultimately, the aesthetic and political space of the Zone helps them establish a conceptual and mnemonic connection between the Soviet past and Ukraine’s present and future. Their practices, in turn, help maintain the Zone’s spatial and epistemological continuity.

The problems we are referring to are associated to a particular case study in the Mayan area of Yucatan. In this place, where groundwater is the only source of freshwater, the inhabitants have to deal with water problems such as resource scarcity, groundwater pollution, climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource degradation. Further, it revealed that one way to improve conservation is to ensure the inclusion of cultural values between people and their environment and this is of significance for evolving strong relations with nature. We examined socio-ecological groundwater relations in contemporary Mayan society by analysing how the ancient Maya obtained freshwater, and how and why contemporary local Mayan communities of Yucatan, Mexico, have transformed the groundwater system by intensify groundwater pollution problems. Several authors have attempted to improve the understanding of complex processes underlying the Maya collapse, and the interactions of this society with nature. But, if the demise of the Mayan populations in the past was the result of complex social and ecological factors, then what are those relations, at present, and how they are conceptualized? What kind of government regulation is necessary, and how can communities make decisions to ensure solutions for conservation, at a time when cultural values, worldviews and traditional practices are being lost? To answer those questions, we review the background to the groundwater problem, and the historical and cultural context of Yucatan groundwater system. We use the Mayan society as a case study to elucidate this and of the induced collapse, exacerbated by the overuse of natural resources in a non- sustainable way.

A potential lever to reduce this disadvantage is to improve the health situation of lower socioeconomic groups. Our objective is to explore how the considerable within-US variation in health inequalities compares to the health inequalities across other Western countries. Methods: Representative survey data from 44 European countries and the US federal states were obtained from the fourth wave of the European Values Study (EVS) and the 2008 wave of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System. Using binary logistic regression, we analyze different forms of educational inequalities in self-rated health (SRH), adjusted for age and sex. Results: The extent of educational inequalities in SRH varies considerably over European countries and US states; with US states in general showing greater inequality, however, differences between US states and European countries are less clear than commonly assumed.

The question we ask is how financialized capitalism shapes and formats the politics of the future. Our central tenet is that, far from providing an engine ’imagining’ futures that substantively guide (collective) actions, finance ‘consumes’ forecasts, plans, or visions in its present coordination process. While the “oscillation” between present futures and future presents has been identified as a defining feature of modern conceptions of contingency, freedom, and choice (Luhmann; Esposito), these two temporal modalities are collapsed in contemporary financial markets in an ongoing ‘pricing in’ of various possible future states. Projected futures do not substantively shape collective paths towards them or instruct social learning, but are calculatively assimilated to improve coordination between present prices.  Fatally, central banks have been at the forefront of “synchronist” (Langenohl) finance, believing that as long as numeric calibration of their own and the markets’ expectations as expressed in prices align, they have rendered capitalism governable. Under this regime, central banks really do not govern inflation, but inflation expectations as expressed in the “yield curve” and built into interest rate derivatives. We argue that financial techniques built on the efficient market hypothesis and the Black-Scholes-Merton formula, as two theoretical articulations of this modern “synchronist” (Langenohl) temporality of finance, allow central banks to ignore possible “random” fluctuations in actual inflation and concentrate on the internal calibration of present futures as the sole criterion for monetary policy success. We show that the resultant “assault” on “future presents” was an important factor in the run-up to the crisis of 2007-9. Central banks deliberately attempted to eliminate uncertainties in markets about the future course of monetary policies. For that purpose, shared fictions about the underlying logics of Western economies (real interest rates, NAIRU etc.) were rigidly built into the structures of asset prices. Moreover, since central banks and market actors aligned their expectations over real interest rates, market actors could act as if their uncertainties about future liquidity needs could be neglected, since current money market and official lending rates were supposed to already define the price of liquidity tomorrow. In the last part of the contribution, we will extend this argument to contemporary quantitative easing, to show how it reinforces the pitfalls of generating expectations of economic prosperity and stability via the contemporary financial system.",TRUE,FALSE,central banks|derivatives|expectation|finance|financial markets|financial system|future|futurity|monetary policy|temporality,2019-11-08T19:44:42.164984,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-08,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Other Political Science|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Finance|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dc0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Political Economy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcb|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Macroeconomics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddf|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Economic Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df4|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Science and Technology Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e28|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Rationality and Society|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2d|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Economic Sociology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3b|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Political Economy of the World System|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e40|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Science, Knowledge, and Technology",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/citation/,8dyq2,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dc456a9bb21c7000d8a193f/,5dc456a9bb21c7000d8a193f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/8dyq2/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/8dyq2/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/8dyq2,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

We find that European publics rank northwest European countries highest on developmental attributes and southwestern European nations highest on attributes of cultural wealth, while they rank eastern European countries lowest in both categorisations.

gzt7a,preprints,2019-07-19,2021-02-15,2019-07-19,NA,NA,How threatening are transformations of happiness scales to subjective wellbeing research?,"Although survey data on happiness are increasingly used in economics, their reliability is a long-standing concern. Two recent studies argue that results based on such data can be reversed with monotonic increasing transformations of the associated happiness scale (Bond and Lang 2019; Schröder and Yitzhaki 2017). These studies raise a serious and widely applicable issue. In response, we make three main contributions. First, we derive a simple test of whether OLS coefficients can be reversed by relabelling the scores of reported happiness and deduce bounds for ratios of coefficients under any labelling scheme. Second, we show that when reversals of OLS coefficients are impossible, reversals using ordered probit regressions (as proposed by Bond and Lang) become speculative from an empirical point of view. Third, we make apparent that in order to achieve reversals, respondents must be assumed to use the response scale in a strongly non-linear fashion. However, drawing from the economic and psychological literature, we present arguments and evidence that respondents use response scales in an approximately linear manner. The paper’s main ideas are illustrated using American GSS data. Additionally, using German SOEP data, we empirically show that sign reversals are impossible or implausible for a wide range of demographic variables.

This paper investigates how underreporting affects estimates of the incidence and composition of poverty in the U.S. from 2013 to 2015. Specifically, I apply benefit adjustments for the underreporting of three social transfers to the Current Population Survey (CPS ASEC) to provide more accurate estimates of poverty rates. Diagnostic checks indicate that the imputed benefit adjustments are imperfect, but do provide a more accurate representation of household income than the uncorrected CPS ASEC data. In 2015, the benefit adjustments add more than $30 billion of income transfers to the CPS ASEC, primarily concentrated among low-income households with children. I test the effects of the benefit corrections on two conceptualizations of poverty: the U.S. Supplemental Poverty Measure (SPM) and a relative measure of poverty set at 50 percent of federal median income. In 2015, the SPM poverty rate for the total population falls from 14.3 to 12.7 percent, a 1.6 percentage point (11 percent) decline, after adjusting for underreporting. Among children, the SPM poverty rate falls from 16.1 to 12.8 percent, a 3.3 percentage point (20 percent) decline. The percent-of-median poverty rate experiences similar declines after applying the benefit imputations. The findings suggest that the unadjusted CPS ASEC data meaningfully overestimates the incidence of poverty in the U.S., particularly among households with children. Documentation for applying the benefit corrections to the CPS ASEC is provided for improved estimates in future poverty research.",TRUE,FALSE,child poverty|CPS ASEC|income|measurement|poverty,2019-01-10T02:16:46.953088,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-10,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/citation/,6vmws,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c35c5a8804708001bf6c1dd/,5c35c5a8804708001bf6c1dd,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/6vmws/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/6vmws/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/6vmws,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11205-018-02053-0,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Saiga are Critically Endangered antelopes from Central Asia with horns (often marketed as ling yang) used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Few past studies have assessed saiga horn consumers. This work is the most extensive consumer research to date specifically characterising saiga horn consumers and usage. We conducted 2294 in-person surveys on saiga horn use with Chinese Singaporeans, employing neutral questioning approaches. We found 19% of individuals reported saiga horn as a product they choose most often for themselves and/or others when treating fever and/or heatiness (a TCM state of illness), indicating a minimum estimate of high-frequency usage, not including possible low-frequency users. Overall saiga users were most characterised as middle-aged Buddhists and Taoists. However, saiga users were found in a range of demographic groups. Women preferred saiga shavings (the more traditional form), while men preferred saiga cooling water (the more modern form). About 53% of individuals who used saiga horn themselves also bought it for someone else. Buyers for others were most likely to be female middle-aged Buddhists or Taoists. Key motivating reasons for usage were “it works” and “someone recommended it to me.” The top two reported recommenders were family and TCM shopkeepers. Saiga users were more likely than non-saiga users to perceive saiga as a common species in the wild. This research holds significance for interventions targeting saiga horn consumption within Singapore and throughout Asia, by identifying potential target audiences, product types, non-desirable alternatives, and motivations for use.",TRUE,FALSE,NA,2019-08-14T18:55:31.744183,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-14,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/citation/,t4dp7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/bk879/,bk879,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d54374e278c07001aad7f00/,5d54374e278c07001aad7f00,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/t4dp7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/t4dp7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/t4dp7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The black-white disparity in mortality rates is widest in young adulthood, and then rates converge with increasing age until a crossover occurs at about age 85 years, after which black older adults exhibit a lower mortality rate relative to white older adults. Data quality issues in survey-linked mortality studies may hinder accurate estimation of this disparity and may even be responsible for the observed black-white mortality crossover, especially if the linkage of surveys to death records during mortality follow-up is less accurate for black older adults. This study assesses black-white differences in the linkage of the 1986–2009 National Health Interview Survey to the National Death Index through 2011 and the implications of racial/ethnic differences in record linkage for mortality disparity estimates. Match class and match score (i.e., indicators of linkage quality) differ by race/ethnicity, with black adults exhibiting less certain matches than white adults in all age groups. The magnitude of the black-white mortality disparity varies with alternative linkage scenarios, but convergence and crossover continue to be observed in each case. Beyond black-white differences in linkage quality, this study also identifies declines over time in linkage quality and even eligibility for linkage among all adults. Although linkage quality is lower among black adults than white adults, differential record linkage does not account for the black-white mortality crossover.",TRUE,FALSE,Mortality|Mortality crossover|National Health Interview Survey|Race|Record linkage,2019-12-02T11:58:02.778012,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-30,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2a|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Racial and Ethnic Minorities|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e2c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Methodology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvgsq/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvgsq/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvgsq/citation/,jvgsq,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvgsq/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvgsq/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvgsq/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de1af7dfbde36000b972b73/,5de1af7dfbde36000b972b73,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvgsq/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvgsq/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/jvgsq/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/jvgsq/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/jvgsq,https://doi.org/10.1007/s11113-016-9415-z,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Why should I care about care?” This question, raised by one of María Puig de la Bellacasa’s colleagues, is one that could be reasonably posed by any critical scholar. Care is, after all, a deeply fraught concept. Historically, the ideal of caretaking has been used to justify women’s domestic confinement and their lack of remuneration. More recently, it’s been coopted by corporations in their altruistic marketing strategies (think “CBS Cares” or “Chase Cares” or “Nordstrom Cares”).

Political discourse is a popular area of research of linguistics, as it covers all aspects of modern life and society. Being mainly broadcasted by the politicians, it is considered a complex linguistic phenomenon, whose objectives, direct or indirect, are aimed at disseminating, implementing political authorities and obtaining the majority of votes during the election campaigns. The article is devoted to the evaluation categories, which refer to the semantic and pragmatic categories and can be one of the strongest tools of influence on the public. Within the framework of our research 29 English articles, posted on the Internet, concerning the political leaders of the United States and Great Britain, attributing the personal characteristics to them, were analysed.

A Quasi-Experimental Approach.,"On February 2, 2017, French police officers brutally abused a young black man, leading to the first wave of 2017 French riots. The present study exploits the coincidence that the focal event occurred during the survey period of the European Social Survey (ESS) 2016 (Nov. 11, 2016 – March 11, 2017) in France, thus providing the basis for a Natural Experiment on the effect of media reporting on police misconduct on trust in the police. Data is analyzed by means of a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) as well as more conventional regression analyses with heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors. In line with procedural justice theory as well as institutional theory, the present study finds support for the notion that this special case of police misconduct did decrease trust in the police. In addition, people reporting a migrant background show even less trust in the police after the event. Frequency of different media consumption does not appear to explain deterioration of trust in the police after the event. The results of this study increase the internal and external validity of the assumption that trust in the police can be explained not only by personal experiences, but also by the perceived unfair treatment of others. Results are robust to various placebo tests. There is some evidence that the effect seems to be short-lived, although the data basis is limited in this regard.

In a longitudinal panel-study of high school/grammar school-level biology and chemistry pre-service teachers at all training colleges in the German State of Rhineland-Palatinate, we examine the role of attitudes, perceived behavioral controls, and subjective norms on the participants’ intention to- and actual use of experiments in the classroom. As a theoretical framework, we use the Theory of Planned Behavior. Attitudes, social norms, behavioural control and behavioural intention were measured at time points t1 and t2; behaviour with regards to experiments was measured at t3. In a second step, we examine which fundamental beliefs influence attitudes, social norms and behavioural control. The analyses show that attitudes, subjective norms and behavioural controls play important roles in determining the use of experiments. While for pre-service teachers with the subject biology attitudes play the most important role, for those with the subject chemistry it is behavioural control that most strongly influences the use experiments.

His performance not only objects to Iranian culture industry, but also emphasizes the importance of an audience as well a proper space in furthering this act. The paper will deconstruct this act of rebellion by scrutinizing the local culture industry in Iran, and then contrasting it with the atmosphere created in this particular underground setting. It will attempt to understand the impact of such a small-scale performance in the grand scheme of the country’s youth movement, and it will analyze the importance of space in engendering it.

Addressing this gap, we present results from a q-methodological study on the meanings and values associated with translation held by researchers and clinicians at two major German biomedical research institutions implementing TR strategies. We identify eight different collective understandings of translation in practice, with respect to both where primary translational problems are located and what the most immediate and effective measures should be.

Informed by both life course and biographical perspectives, our research design comprised two interviews incorporating recursive co-construction of the participant’s lifeline. We aimed to meet three objectives with this method: (1) to collect accurate retrospective data about the timing of lives; (2) to garner biographical data that allowed us to explore lives as wholes; and (3) to elicit participant reflexivity on turning points associated with resilience.  Our approach was distinctive in its explicit use of the lifeline both as a means to bring life stories into dialogue with life histories, and as a dynamic prompt to engage participants in the reflexive co-construction of turning points as fateful moments. We illustrate our approach through a case presentation and analysis of the reflexive lifelines co-constructed with two men who participated in our study.

That is, we examine whether parental death has an equalizing or exacerbating effect on offspring socioeconomic attainment, and also whether the socioeconomic status of the rest of the family plays a meaningful role in compensating for parental death. Using data on cohorts born 1973 to 1982 we examine five different outcomes, which are grade point average (GPA) at age 16 in high school, the transition from lower to upper-secondary education, the transition to tertiary education, overall educational attainment, and occupational status by age 30. We match families based upon antemortem parental socioeconomic trajectories. Overall, we find mixed results in our between-family regression analyses adjusting for observables, with inconsistent evidence suggesting that losing a parent with very high socioeconomic resources is worse, and some evidence for a protective effect if the socioeconomic resources of the surviving parent and extended family members are at the top of the distribution. Using sibling fixed effects models that adjust for unobservable factors shared within the family, we see zero results for moderation by parents’ occupations, but find consistent evidence that it is worse to lose a father at a younger age if grandparents have higher ranked occupations.

p6c3g,preprints,2019-08-20,2019-08-22,2019-08-22,NA,NA,The Impact of BMI on Mental Health: Further Evidence from Genetic Markers,"We examine the relationship between BMI and mental health for young adults and elderly individuals using data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health and the Health &amp; Retirement Study. While OLS estimates show that BMI is significantly associated with worse mental health in both young adulthood and old age, they are likely to be confounded by (i) unobserved factors that affect both BMI and mental health and (ii) reverse causality. To tackle confounding, we take two complementary approaches. First, we use a polygenic score for BMI as an IV and adjust for polygenic scores for other factors that may invalidate this IV. The IV estimates indicate that there is no statistically significant relationship between BMI and mental health for young adults, whereas there is a positive and statistically significant relationship for the elderly. Moreover, we show that IV estimates likely have to be interpreted as identifying a weighted average of effects of BMI on mental health mostly for individuals on the upper quantiles of the BMI distribution. Given potential remaining concerns about the validity of the IV, our second approach is to consider it an “imperfect” IV and estimate an upper bound on the average treatment effect for the corresponding population following Nevo &amp; Rosen (2012). The estimated upper bounds reinforce the conclusions from the IV estimates: they show little evidence of a detrimental effect of BMI on mental health for young adults while being consistent with an economically meaningful effect for elderly individuals. Lastly, we explore some of the potential channels through which BMI may affect mental health for the elderly.",TRUE,FALSE,depression|instrumental variables|mental health|obesity|polygenic scores,2019-08-22T15:40:02.811998,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/citation/,p6c3g,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d5c06c5884b6600175bd1c7/,5d5c06c5884b6600175bd1c7,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/p6c3g/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/p6c3g/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/p6c3g,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

It also expands into a discussion of the discrepancies existing between stated objectives and classroom practice. This deviation from the prescribed syllabus is dictated by the Baccalaureate exam, a standardized test par excellence and the ‘entry visa’ to university.

Panel data evidence from The Netherlands during the Great Recession, 2007–2015","Political developments since the 2008 financial crisis have sparked renewed interest in the electoral implications of economic downturns. Research describes a correlation between adverse economic conditions and support for radical parties campaigning on the populist promise to retake the country from a corrupt elite. But does the success of radical parties following economic crises rely on people who are directly affected? To answer this question, we examine whether individual-level changes in economic circumstances drive support for radical parties across the ideological divide. Analyzing eight waves of panel data collected in The Netherlands, before, during, and after the Great Recession (2007–2015), we demonstrate that people who experienced an income loss became more supportive of the radical left but not of the radical right. Looking at these parties’ core concerns, we find that income loss increased support for income redistribution championed by the radical left, but less so for the anti-immigration policies championed by the radical right.

concepts. That these sentiments overlap among members of a culture presumably reflects their roots in the language use that members observe.  Yet the degree to which the affective meaning of a concept is encoded in the way linguistic representations of that concept are used in everyday symbolic exchange has yet to be demonstrated.  The question has methodological as well as theoretical significance for affect control theory, as language may provide an unobtrusive, behavioral method of obtaining EPA ratings complementary to those heretofore obtained via questionnaires.  We pursue a series of studies that evaluate whether tools from machine learning and computational linguistics can capture the fundamental affective meaning of concepts from large text corpora. We develop an algorithm that uses word embeddings to predict EPA profiles available from a recent EPA dictionary derived from traditional questionnaires, as well as novel concepts collected using an open-source web app we have developed.

Classic urban form visualizations – from Giambattista Nolli’s ichnographic maps of Rome to Allan Jacobs’s figure-ground diagrams of city streets – have compressed physical urban complexity into easily comprehensible information artifacts. Today we can enhance these traditional workflows through the Smart Cities paradigm of understanding cities via user-generated content and harvested data in an information management context. New spatial technology platforms and big data offer new lenses to understand, evaluate, monitor, and manage urban form and evolution. This paper builds on the theoretical framework of visual cultures in urban planning and morphology to introduce and situate computational data science processes for exploring urban fabric patterns and spatial order. It demonstrates these workflows with OSMnx and data from OpenStreetMap, a collaborative spatial information system and mapping platform, to examine street network patterns, orientations, and configurations in different study sites around the world, considering what these reveal about the urban fabric.

To build our argument, we draw on two presidential elections held in Iran in 2009 and 2013.

The sample of the study consisted of 132 randomly-selected EFL preparatory year instructors at Al-Imam Mohammad Ibn Saud Islamic University, Princess Nourah Bint Abdulrahman University, and King Saud University in Riyadh city. Three instruments were utilized to collect data for the study: the first one was a questionnaire, the second was semi-structured interviews, and the third one was lectures observations. The researcher designed a five-point Likert scale questionnaire to collect the data of the study which was validated by a panel of raters consisting of ten university professors and instructors. To ensure reliability, Cronbach Alpha formula was calculated. Besides, The findings of the study revealed that the causes of Saudi EFL university instructors’ barriers to teaching the speaking skill in the preparatory year were as follows: students’ use of L1 during group work or pair work, lack of vocabulary, fear of making mistakes, lack of self-confidence, and lack of motivation. Furthermore, the study results advocated the following solutions to Saudi EFL university instructors’ barriers to teaching the speaking skill: enhancing students’ self-confidence to speak without fear, correcting students’ mistakes kindly, meeting students’ needs in speaking textbooks, and adopting recent motivating techniques, increasing the motivating speaking activities in textbooks, and testing the speaking skill.

This paper carefully examines the most widely-read translations of particle هل as held up through the Quran. It is a critique of the translation of the Quran. Contrary to the long-standing concept which perceives هل as solely an interrogative particle, this paper crosses t’s and dots i’s in relation to focusing translators’ attention on other almost-overlooked linguistic functions carried by هل, i.e. corroborative, negative and imperative. It is found that particle هل in all contexts is dealt with from the same perspective in the translations.

year estimates of demographic and socioeconomic indicator data for small geographies
throughout the United States. These estimates are commonly used as indicators for
regression models to measure conditions in communities. The Margins of Error (MOE) in
the ACS estimates for small geographic areas can often be very large, and without taking
them into account, regression analyses using them can be mis-specified, leading to bias in
regression coefficients and model standard errors. This paper directly compares
measurement error model specifications to naive model specifications for a mortality
outcome in Texas Census tracts using Bayesian model specializations. The results show
that there is bias in the naive regression model results. We urge users of the ACS
summary file data to be aware of such bias as it can potentially impact interpretation of
model results and hypothesis tests.",TRUE,FALSE,American Community Survey|Bayesian models|Demography|Mortality|Uncertainty,2019-03-22T19:02:03.548878,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-03-22,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dy9aw/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dy9aw/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dy9aw/citation/,dy9aw,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dy9aw/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dy9aw/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/etmwz/,etmwz,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dy9aw/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c95190aae813800198cd31f/,5c95190aae813800198cd31f,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dy9aw/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dy9aw/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/dy9aw/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/dy9aw/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/dy9aw,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Writing skill is an essential component in mastering English because it incorporates all elements in English. By integrating technology in the learning process, students would be able to improve their writing skill. In Malaysia, students’ performance in examination has declined in recent years since the marks are based mostly on students’ writing. This research aims to know the impact of Digital Storytelling towards Malaysian secondary school students by investigating its impact on content, grammar, vocabulary and overall performance. It also explores students' perception of Digital Storytelling. This quasi-experimental study involved 52 Form four students from a fully-residential school in Melaka who were chosen using convenient sampling as part of the controlled and experimental groups. Data were collected from pre-tests, post-tests and a semi-structured interview. The quantitative data were analyzed using mean analysis, Wilcoxon Signed Tank Test and Independent t-Test while qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. Findings show that there is a significant difference in the score before and after the intervention but there is no significant difference between the score of the experimental group and the controlled group. Participants stated that DS motivates them to write and improves their writing. It is hoped that this study would provide an alternative to teaching narrative writing and adds to the current pool of literature.

The securitisation of cross-border mobility has been a common theme in examining immigration policies in the Global North. The securitisation of emigration and diasporas in non-democratic contexts remains neglected; this is particularly true with regard to Arab states’ extraterritorial authoritarian practices. This article argues that authoritarian states develop a range of migration policies that are driven by the contradictory pressures of economic and political imperatives or, put differently, an ""illiberal paradox"": if a state does not expect economic gains from cross-border mobility, it is more likely to securitise its emigration policy; otherwise, it is more likely to securitise its diaspora policy.

We provide a new actor-centric approach to explicitly model strategic interdependence in multi-actor civil wars. We argue that competitive dynamics dominate strategic behavior between rebel organizations, but these can be offset by incentives to free-ride in cases where the underlying incompatibility displays public good characteristics. Based on a network game theoretic model, we derive a statistical framework that allows for a direct test of strategic interdependence. We find that the estimated duration interdependence is positive, that is weaker in secessionist conflicts, and that modeling this interdependence explicitly outweighs existing empirical measures of interdependence (e.g. number of organizations).

This capacity demands both opacity respect—preserving a gap between the self we present and the self we conceal—and an ability to call into question practices that are ethically wanting. Pushed to its limit, the smooth optimisation of our environment may prevent us from experiencing many of the tensions that otherwise prompt us to reconsider accepted practices. An optimally personalised world may not ever call for any ‘action’ as Hannah Arendt describes it.

Can systems be designed to personalise responsibly? Greater time and research needs to be invested in designing a range of viable ‘perspective widening’ tools, as many such tools either burden users with little guarantee of meaningful engagement, or underestimate the extent to which individuals’ preferences are themselves malleable. Any approach that tries to predict what users might like, or what might change their views, risks the same pitfalls as any other form of personalisation. Instead, we argue that the most promising avenue is to push for diverse uses of newly developed systems, and measure those systems’ success at least partly on that basis. Inviting appropriation  and repurposing would help keep users engaged in systems of data collection and profiling. This will not be a straightforward task: sometimes it will be in tension with traditional measures of success and performance.

How well does school enjoyment explain later educational achievement? Does early school enjoyment at age 6 associate with social or gender differences in later educational achievement at age 16? Our results show that school enjoyment measured at age 6 is associated with gender and cognitive ability but not family socioeconomic background. For example, girls were twice as likely to report enjoying school than boys (OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.56, 2.48). School enjoyment strongly associated with later achievement even after adjustment for socioeconomic background and cognitive ability; pupils who reported enjoying school scored on average 14.4 (95% CI: 6.9, 21.9) more points, equivalent to almost a 3-grade increase across all GCSE’s, and were 29% more likely to obtain 5+ A*-Cs including Maths and English (OR: 1.29; 95% CI: 0.99, 1.7) than those who did not enjoy school. These results highlight the importance of school enjoyment for educational achievement. As a potentially more modifiable factor than socioeconomic background, cognitive ability or gender, school enjoyment may represent a promising intervention target for improving educational outcomes. Whether these relationships are causal should be tested via experimental studies.",TRUE,FALSE,ALSPAC|Attainment|Cognition|Education|Emotion|GCSE|Intelligence,2019-08-10T18:51:10.694112,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-10,NA,NA,no,Data can be accessed by all bonafide researchers by application to the ALSPAC executive committee.

A bibliometric approach is proposed for a case study of a scientific discipline, language and period that are poorly represented in current bibliographic databases. These constraints led to the generation of a data set with articles from 5 journals (2842 articles and 1221 unique authors). Publication language and author nationalities were manually included in the data set. Journal internationality measures and coauthorship network analyses showed: 1) that internationalisation was not the most striking change over the study period: it was one of a number of features that journal editors addressed in their own way; 2) results confirm a change in the social organisation of scientific production in archaeology, with the emergence of co-authorship and reflect the differentiation of local research trends.

Income Inequality, Relative Deprivation, and Financial Satisfaction in U.S. States, 1973–2012","Many accounts posit that as income inequality rises, individuals will be less satisfied with their own financial situation as they feel increasingly deprived relative to others—driving these individuals to spend more as they engage in positional competition and increasing their anxieties as position in the income distribution becomes ever more important. I examine if and for whom income inequality reduces financial satisfaction by analyzing the 1973–2012 General Social Surveys linked to state-level administrative data based on tax returns, the Census, and the American Community Survey. I find that higher state-level income inequality decreases financial satisfaction overall, and I further find that this effect is especially pronounced for those in the middle of the income distribution.

As a consequence, the issue of sustainable waste management has become an important priority for policymakers and other stakeholders of the society. Although there are potentials to recycle up to 80 per cent of the total dry wastes collected, currently most of them are deposited into various landfill sites. Waste treatment facilities are also insufficient in the country. The government has introduced SWM Act 2007 along with other initiatives to improve the waste management scenario, but more needs to be done to be able to recycle and treat a major portion of the wastes. Based on studies on the state of Selangor in Malaysia, this paper this paper attempts to analyse the waste management scenario of Malaysia and the problems and prospects of waste recycling there.

Yet conservationists increasingly recognise the importance of implementing demand-side interventions that target the end consumers in the trade chain. Their aim is to curb the consumption of wildlife or shift consumption to more sustainable alternatives. However, there are still considerable knowledge gaps in our understanding of the diversity of consumer motivations in the context of illegal wildlife trade, which includes hundreds of thousands of species, different uses, and diverse contexts. We developed a typology of common motivations held by wildlife consumers that can be used to inform conservation interventions, based upon consultation with multiple experts from a diversity of backgrounds, nationalities, and focal taxa. We identified five main motivational categories for wildlife use: experiential, social, functional, financial, and spiritual, each containing sub-categories. This framework is intended to facilitate more nuanced approaches to demand reduction, such as the tailoring of interventions—whether behaviour change campaigns, enforcement efforts, or incentive programmes—to the specific context in which they will be used. It is an important step towards producing a more systematic approach to designing demand reduction interventions that are more likely to succeed.",TRUE,FALSE,Behavior change|Behaviour change|Conservation social science|Consumer research|Demand reduction|Illegal wildlife trade,2019-10-26T19:15:21.749746,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-10-26,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df3|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Animal Studies,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/citation/,7vjrg,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5db3180b46b571000e098a0c/,5db3180b46b571000e098a0c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/7vjrg/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/7vjrg/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/7vjrg,https://doi.org/10.1111/cobi.13578,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Just as biologists seek to explain population-level trends in genetic evolution in terms of micro-evolutionary processes such as selection, drift and migration, cultural evolutionists have sought to explain population-level cultural phenomena in terms of underlying social, psychological and demographic factors. Primary amongst these factors are learning biases, describing how cultural items are socially transmitted from person to person. As big datasets become more openly available and workable, and statistical modelling techniques become more powerful, efficient and user-friendly, describing population-level dynamics in terms of simple, individual-level learning biases is becoming more feasible. Here we test for the presence of learning biases in two large datasets of popular song lyrics dating from 1965-2015. We find some evidence of content bias, prestige bias and success bias in the proliferation of negative lyrics, and suggest that negative expression of emotions in music, and perhaps art generally, provides an avenue for people to not only process and express their own negative emotions, but also benefit from the knowledge that prestigious others experience similarly negative emotions as they do.",TRUE,FALSE,big data|content bias|cultural evolution|emotions|prestige bias|song lyrics|success bias,2019-01-17T21:53:21.583548,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-17,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d98|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Psychology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfc|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Biological and Physical Anthropology|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76e0c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Social Statistics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/citation/,3j6wx,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c40b3687cf3f5001bb8d78c/,5c40b3687cf3f5001bb8d78c,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/3j6wx/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/3j6wx/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3j6wx,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

First, they occurred between two democratic NATO allies, members of a Western security community. Second, Iceland came close to withdrawing its NATO membership and closing the US base on Icelandic soil, which would have adversely affected the balance of power in the North Atlantic and jeopardized Iceland’s core security interests. Third, Iceland, a microstate, won each of these disputes. Historians and political scientists have consequently found it problematic to account for these puzzling disputes. This study proposes a Neoclassical Realist account for the occurrence and outcomes of the Cod Wars. I argue that the disputes occurred due to (i) powerful domestic pressures on statesmen to escalate and (ii) elite miscalculation.

7tazd,preprints,2019-07-25,2019-07-25,2019-07-25,NA,NA,Breaking the chain: How arrests reduce the probability of near repeat crimes,"Objectives: Near repeat patterns have been identified for a host of different crimes, but effective strategies to reduce near repeats have had more variable results. This study identifies near repeat crime patterns in Dallas, Texas and examines the effects of an arrest on reducing the probability of future crime. 

Method: Using open source crime data from the Dallas Police Department from July 2014 through June 2018, we identified near repeat patterns for shootings, interpersonal robberies, residential burglaries, and thefts from motor vehicles. Logistic regression models were used to test the effect of an arrest on reducing near repeat crimes; controls for geographic, demographic, and temporal factors were included in each model. 

Results: Near repeat calculations suggest violent crime clustered closely in time and space, with property crime dispersed over larger spatial and temporal dimensions. Across all four crime types, findings suggest arrests resulted in 20% to 40% reductions in a near repeat follow up crime.

Conclusions: In line with past research on shootings, arrests reduced the likelihood of subsequent crimes. This suggests policing strategies to increase arrests may be a fruitful way to reduce near repeat crime patterns.

This article analyses the peacebuilding implications of a ‘burning plasma’ fusion breakthrough, with its enormous implications for both worsening conflicts and for peacebuilding. To do so, we apply the nonkilling global political science peacebuilding conceptual framework; the quintuple helix technology innovation ecosystem model, emphasizing the role of civil society and socioecology; and recent path dependence theory. The first burning plasma will be a nearly unprecedented historical event. The closest parallel is the Trinity Test, which heralded the Atomic Age, the implications of which for perpetuating conflict and potentially for peacebuilding were keenly understood; we analyse the Test in path dependence terms for the first time to compare it with fusion. As with fission power, fusion will be weaponized due to its intrinsic benefits. However, the innovations leading to the burning plasma are not occurring in a vacuum. Unlike Trinity, which was conducted in secret in wartime without civilian or media contributions, fusion is being developed in peacetime in the public eye, and in the context of a low-carbon transition. With fission, immediately following the Second World War, despite initial progress, the USSR rejected the US Baruch Plan to put atomic energy and weapons under the UN to stifle a nuclear arms race, due to an insufficient political imperative to cooperate. The result was the Cold War. As such, we forecast a global critical juncture in which a new normative nuclear order can be created via a ‘new Baruch Plan’, with governments, the private sector, the International Energy Agency, the IAEA, and civil society accelerating the development and commercialization of fusion power. Moreover, if the world does finally enjoy ‘energy for all’, the expected decrease in interstate conflict opens up the possibility of a Universal Global Peace Treaty, with humanity re-prioritising its goals for this century.",TRUE,FALSE,climate change|global nonkilling political science|nuclear fusion|peace building|quintuple helix innovation ecosystem|railgun,2019-09-04T19:54:26.816956,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-09-04,FALSE,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,not_applicable,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d95|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Other International and Area Studies,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/citation/,mrzua,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/n6p7x/,n6p7x,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d6ff05b536cf5001a8e67d6/,5d6ff05b536cf5001a8e67d6,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/mrzua/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/mrzua/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/mrzua,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Local adaptation measures, such as early warning systems for floods (EWSFs), are urgently needed to reduce the risk and impact of flood events. The aim of this study was to assess community perceptions and self-reported actions in response to flooding in a tropical coastal city to inform flood risk reduction policies and programs.
Methods: This qualitative case study was conducted in flood-prone areas in Machala, Ecuador, a coastal city exposed to seasonal floods and extreme floods during El Niño events. Adult community members from three periurban sites were invited to participate. Focus groups discussions (11 focus groups in total) were held with community members (n=65 people) from September to November 2014 to assess perceptions of flood exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and current alert systems. Focus groups discussions were audio recorded, transcribed, and coded by topic; participatory maps were field validated, georeferenced, and digitized using GIS software. 
Results: Community members identified the presence of annual flooding during the rainy season, as well as greater than normal flood events (depths ranging from 0.5 to 3 meters), which recurred every 3-4 years in some communities. The deepest floods occurred during the 1982 and 1997/1998 El Niño events. Community members perceived that exposure to flooding depended on the rainfall coinciding with high ocean tides, and geographic proximity to blocked drainage areas, canals, and low local elevation. Participants reported that children were the most sensitive group due to increased susceptibility to skin infections and mosquito borne diseases (i.e., dengue fever). Other sensitive groups included the elderly, physically handicapped people, low-income families, and recent migrants. They identified persistent social-ecological vulnerabilities that increased flood risk and exposure in the urban periphery, such as inadequate access to garbage collection, homes settled in precarious low-lying geographies, economic barriers, lack of political access, and lack of social mobilization. In addition, communities expressed a lack of social capital (e.g. political voice), despite the existence of formalized community councils. Key neighborhood resources with respect to flooding included green areas, schools, nurseries, fire stations, health clinics, police stations, a retention wall (berm), and an emergency meeting place. Challenges for adaptive capacity existed primarily in actions related to the preparation and recovery stages of flooding. Despite the presence of an official flood warning system, community member relied on informal communication channels via social media. 
Conclusions: The flood vulnerability assessment framework and participatory research process utilized here can potentially inform studies in other flood-prone regions to guide the development of EWSFs and other climate change adaptation policies and actions.",TRUE,FALSE,adaptation|climate|community-based|early warning systems|Ecuador|El Niño|flooding|focus groups|Latin America|livelihoods|natural disasters|participatory GIS|urban|vulnerability,2019-04-19T00:13:32.116584,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-04-19,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d86|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8c|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Geography|Nature and Society Relations|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8f|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|Latin American Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d97|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Urban Studies and Planning|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Environmental Studies,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/citation/,ygh92,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/kzm3e/,kzm3e,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5cb8bc4ea3bc970019f31cc2/,5cb8bc4ea3bc970019f31cc2,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/ygh92/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/ygh92/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ygh92,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Innovations in causal inference have shed new light on these effects. Here, we motivate the importance of innovation in the characterization of fecundity, and prenatal selection in particular. We argue that such innovation is crucial for expanding knowledge of the fetal origins of later life health. Pregnancy loss is common, responsive to environmental factors, and closely related to maternal and fetal health outcomes. As a result, selection into live birth is driven by many of the same exposures that shape the health trajectories of survivors. Lifecourse effects that are inferred without accounting for these dynamics may be significantly distorted by survival bias. We use a set of Monte Carlo simulations with realistic parameters to examine the implications of prenatal survival bias. We find that even in conservatively specified scenarios, true fetal origin effects can be underestimated by 50% or more. In contrast, effects of exposures that reduce the probability of prenatal survival but improve the health of survivors will be overestimated. The absolute magnitude of survival bias can even exceed small effect sizes, resulting in inferences that beneficial exposures are harmful or vice-versa. We also find reason for concern that moderately sized true effects, underestimated due to failure to account for selective survival, are missing from scientific knowledge because they do not clear statistical significance filters. This bias has potential real-world costs; policy decisions about interventions to improve maternal and infant health will be affected by underestimated program impact.",TRUE,FALSE,cohort health|fecundity|fetal origins|lifecourse health|mortality selection|survival bias,2019-12-05T18:09:22.414129,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-12-05,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dbe|5a8c80f8c698300375c76dcd|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Economics|Health Economics|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e3e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Population|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e46|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Aging and the Life Course,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/citation/,x4zm6,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5de81442ab905e000cf567aa/,5de81442ab905e000cf567aa,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/x4zm6/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/x4zm6/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/x4zm6,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Moreover, the paper stresses the impact of the authors as females on their characters’ development throughout that journey. Following the analytical approach within the feminist theory, the article is influenced by two major feminist critiques; Virginia Woolf and Simone De Beauvoir, who believed that women should incorporate their voices into their writings to depict more realistic female characters.

They are said to lack accuracy, encourage gaming and ultimately fail to improve performance. Yet, despite their well-documented weaknesses, performance indicators abound in governance. This article asks under which conditions performance indicators can improve performance outcomes, despite these proven weaknesses and dysfunctions. Our case study is the stress test of the European banking system, a high-profile performance indicator used for risk regulation. Based on interviews with risk managers in Belgian banks as well as staff at the European Central Bank, the European Banking Authority and the National Bank of Belgium, we find that the process of calculating the stress test improves performance outcomes in itself. It does so by fostering banks’ capacity to self-regulate, tying into Foucault’s notion of governmentality. As such, practitioners and academics should not only pay attention to how performance results can be used, but also examine how the process of calculating the performance indicator might be designed to improve performance outcomes latently.",TRUE,FALSE,governmentality|performance indicators|stress test,2019-11-24T19:55:40.844428,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-11-24,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df1|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Public Administration",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/citation/,vf9yn,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5dd7e7466fc769000ad4d9c4/,5dd7e7466fc769000ad4d9c4,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/vf9yn/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/vf9yn/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vf9yn,https://doi.org/10.1177/0020852319857804,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

And, from an epidemiological vantage there is substantive research examining how social traits of neighbourhoods affect health. However, this research has often focused on the effects of social deprivation. Less attention has been given to social fragmentation (SF), a construct aligned with the notions of lesser: social cohesion, social capital, collective functioning, and social isolation. Concurrently, there has been limited research that has described the spatial and temporal patterning of neighbourhood-level social traits. With a focus on SF the main aims of this paper were to model and describe the time-varying and spatial nature of SF.
Conceptually, this research was informed by ‘thinking in time’ and by the ‘lifecourse-of-place’ perspective. While, from an analytical perspective, a longitudinal (3-time points over 10-years) neighbourhood database was created for the metropolitan region of Adelaide, Australia. Latent Transition Analysis was then used to model the developmental profile of SF where neighbourhoods were proxied by ‘suburbs’, and the measurement model for SF was formed of 9-conceptually related census-based indicators. A four-class, nominal-level latent status model of SF was identified: class-A=low SF; class-B=mixed-level SF/inner urban; class-C=mixed-level SF/peri-urban; and class-D=high SF. Class-A and -D neighbourhoods were the most prevalent at all time points.

Specifically, the objectives are to describe the syntax error patterns committed by the student while engaging in speaking and to explore the contributing factors that may affect the errors. To address these objectives, a qualitative research method is employed. Data was collected through audio-tape recordings and a face-to-face interview with the participant. The recorded data was transcribed and coded based on Noor Hashim's (1996)  seven categories of errors. The findings indicate that some of the  first language (L1) negative transfer errors fall into five out of seven categories of Noor Hashim's classification; however, new categories are discovered, such as wrong verb choice, noun forms, overly restricted use of pronouns, and omission of necessary complementizers. These errors can be explained by interference from the L1 and another contributing factor is the limited use of some strategies, such as repetition and confirmation. The significance of this study is a direct pedagogical implication to expose post-graduate students to academic spoken English. This is to avoid miscommunication between students and their academic supervisors.

Past works have attributed this “openness” to deliberate government strategy or lack of capacity. Most, however, do not consider the role of private social media companies, to whom the state delegates information controls. I suggest that the apparent incompleteness of censorship is largely a result of principal-agent problems that arise due to misaligned incentives of government principals and private media company agents. Using a custom dataset of annotated leaked documents from a social media company, Sina Weibo, I find that 16% of directives from the government are disobeyed by Sina Weibo and that disobedience is driven by Sina’s concerns about censoring more strictly than competitor Tencent. I also find that the fragmentation inherent in the Chinese political system exacerbates this principal agent problem. I demonstrate this by retrieving actual censored content from large databases of hundreds of millions of Sina Weibo posts and measuring the performance of Sina Weibo’s censorship employees across a range of events. This paper contributes to our understanding of media control in China by uncovering how market competition can lead media companies to push back against state directives and increase space for counter-hegemonic discourse.",TRUE,FALSE,bureaucracy|censorship|China|delegation|information control|social media,2019-01-12T20:00:41.099219,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-12,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76daf|5a8c80f8c698300375c76db2|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Political Science|Comparative Politics,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/citation/,wn7pr,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96c,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c3a2d2d804708001bf8d910/,5c3a2d2d804708001bf8d910,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/wn7pr/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/wn7pr/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/wn7pr,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

Population-averaged models were used to examine the associations between multiple measures of wealth and obesity among 6,979 respondents while controlling for education, occupation, income, and relevant sociodemographic variables.

Results: The analysis found a robust association between wealth and midlife obesity as well as heterogeneity in the wealth-obesity association across gender, race, and measure of wealth. With the exception of Black men, net worth generally had a significant and inverse relationship with obesity. The net worth-obesity association was largest among women and was driven primarily by home value—in addition to savings and debt for Black women. Although home value was significant for White men, the components of wealth were generally unrelated to obesity among men. 

Conclusions: The association between wealth can obesity was generally robust but also complex, depending on gender, race, and measure of wealth. Research that does not consider multiple components of wealth may overlook the importance of economic resources in shaping obesity rates in the U.S. population",TRUE,FALSE,gender|health disparities|obesity|race|SES|socioeconomic status|wealth,2019-08-13T20:47:51.010593,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-08-13,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80fac698300375c76e20|5a8c80fac698300375c76e4e|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Sociology|Medical Sociology,NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgw59/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgw59/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgw59/citation/,cgw59,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgw59/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgw59/relationships/node/,NA,NA,NA,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgw59/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5d51acb773347900176e329e/,5d51acb773347900176e329e,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgw59/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgw59/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/cgw59/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/cgw59/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/cgw59,https://doi.org/10.1177/0164027519884760,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA

The ‘Enhanced School Health Initiative’ (ESHI) targeted 30 primary schools in southern Ethiopia and aimed to improve the health and educational outcomes of school children through an integrated package of school feeding, deworming and the provision of improved water sanitation and hygiene (WASH). This study investigated parental perceptions of this integrated school health and nutrition programme. 
Methods. The data was collected through group interviews with parents of children at schools targeted by the programme. Ten schools were purposively selected to represent geographical diversity. A team of two trained facilitators led the group interview in each school. All interviews were conducted in local dialects and then directly translated into English and transcribed. The transcripts were analysed using thematic analysis. Findings are structured around key themes identified from the discussions.
Results and Discussion. Three main themes are identified from the interviews. The first relates to the perceptions of equity and opportunity generated for the children and the parents as a result of the programme. The second theme identifies the dissemination of learning throughout the community reported by parents. This includes the use of children as messengers, particularly for good hygiene practices and importance of deworming. The final theme explores concerns about ownership and sustainability of the programme within the communities. When probed on the topic of sustainability, parents raised conflicts surrounding ownership, and their ability to sustain the programme without further external input. 
Conclusions. The findings highlight the parent’s perceptions of this integrated school health and nutrition programme, and the multiple mechanisms through which it has an impact on the wider community. They also highlight what aspects of the programme are felt to be sustainable without further input, particularly behaviour change.",TRUE,FALSE,deworming|Focus Group Discussions|intestinal worms|Local perceptions|School Feeding|WASH,2019-01-08T20:04:02.714401,NA,NA,TRUE,accepted,2019-01-08,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,"5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d8e|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d92|Social and Behavioral Sciences|International and Area Studies|African Studies|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d96|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Other Social and Behavioral Sciences|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de0|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Social Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f8c698300375c76ddb|5a8c80f9c698300375c76de9|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Public Affairs, Public Policy and Public Administration|Education Policy|5a8c80f7c698300375c76d84|5a8c80f9c698300375c76df6|5a8c80f9c698300375c76dfa|Social and Behavioral Sciences|Anthropology|Social and Cultural Anthropology",NA,2019,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/bibliographic_contributors/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/citation/,s9ac7,preprints,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/identifiers/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/relationships/node/,https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/ehfyr/,ehfyr,nodes,https://api.osf.io/v2/licenses/563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a/,563c1cf88c5e4a3877f9e96a,licenses,https://api.osf.io/v2/providers/preprints/socarxiv/,socarxiv,preprint-providers,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/files/,https://api.osf.io/v2/files/5c34dc528047080018f87d2a/,5c34dc528047080018f87d2a,files,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/review_actions/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/requests/,https://api.osf.io/v2/preprints/s9ac7/,https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/s9ac7/,https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/s9ac7,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA
