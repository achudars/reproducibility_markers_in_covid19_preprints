Pathogens experience selection on traits at multiple scales, including replication rates within host individuals and transmissibility between hosts. We analyze a stochastic model linking pathogen growth and competition within individuals to transmission between individuals. Our analysis reveals a new factor, the cross-scale reproductive number of a mutant virion, that quantifies how quickly mutant strains increase in frequency when they initially appear in the infected host population. This cross-scale reproductive number combines with viral mutation rates, single-strain reproductive numbers, and transmission bottleneck width to determine the likelihood of evolutionary emergence, and whether evolution occurs swiftly or gradually within chains of transmission. We find that wider transmission bottlenecks facilitate emergence of pathogens with short-term infections, but hinder emergence of pathogens exhibiting cross-scale selective conflict and long-term infections. Our results provide a framework to advance the integration of laboratory, clinical and field data in the context of evolutionary theory, laying the foundation for a new generation of evidence-based risk assessment of emergence threats.",1,2,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/066688v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/066688v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_066688.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In E. coli, experimental studies performed over the past six decades have revealed major growth laws relating ribosomal mass fraction and cell size to the growth rate. Because they formalize complex emerging principles in biology, growth laws have been instrumental in shaping our understanding of bacterial physiology. Here, we discovered a novel size law that connects cell size to the inverse of the metabolic proteome mass fraction and the active fraction of ribosomes. We used a simple whole-cell coarse-grained model of cell physiology that combines the proteome allocation theory and the structural model of cell division. The model captures all available experimental data connecting the cell proteome composition, ribosome activity, division size and growth rate in response to nutrient quality, antibiotic treatment and increased protein burden. Finally, a stochastic extension of the model explains non-trivial correlations observed in single cell experiments including the adder principle.

In the case of microorganisms, the decreasing cost of sequencing has enabled researchers to generate ever-larger sequence datasets, which in turn have begun to fill gaps in the evolutionary history of microbial groups. However, phylogenetic analyses of these types of datasets create complex trees that can be challenging to interpret. Scientific inferences made by visual inspection of phylogenetic trees can be simplified and enhanced by customizing various parts of the tree. Yet, manual customization is time-consuming and error prone, and programs designed to assist in batch tree customization often require programming experience or complicated file formats for annotation. Iroki, a user-friendly web interface for tree visualization, addresses these issues by providing automatic customization of large trees based on metadata contained in tab-separated text files. Irokis utility for exploring biological and ecological trends in sequencing data was demonstrated through a variety of microbial ecology applications in which trees with hundreds to thousands of leaf nodes were customized according to extensive collections of metadata.

However, reconstruction of this evolutionary history is subject to a great deal of uncertainty, as selection and alignment of extant descendants to represent each ancestor dramatically affects phylogenetic inference of all ancestral nodes. Although historically problematic and somewhat ignored, here we capitalize on that variability by subsampling descendants of each ancestor, generating an ensemble of reconstructions, and integrating over the resulting topological diversity to improve the accuracy of ancestor divergence reconstruction, above the level of subsampling. First, we demonstrate that reproducibility of an all-sequence, single-alignment reconstruction, measured by comparing topologies inferred from 90% subsamples, can be used to assess the likely accuracy of single-alignment reconstructions. We believe this relationship results from modulation of the likelihood landscape around the true topology induced by alignments of resampled sequences. Second, we hypothesize that topological features observed consistently across an ensemble of subsampled reconstructions best reflect true evolutionary history, despite the inaccuracy of each individual reconstruction due to the failure by substitution models to infer the correct sequence of mutations that produced the input sequences. We present a scoring function that evaluates topologies on the basis of their consistency with features extracted from an ensemble, and a reconstruction algorithm (ASPEN) that produces and ranks topologies according to that function. We test our methodology on 600 simulated protein families and the LacI transcription factor family, and find that ASPEN topologies are significantly more accurate than single-alignment reconstructions.",1,5,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/170787v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/170787v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_170787.txt,1,general-purpose repository,1,all sequence simulation materials and simulated sequence alignments are available via figshare (10.6084/m9.figshare.5263885).;     all sequence simulation materials including synthetic phylogenies the template alignment and indel-seq-gen control files as well as simulated sequence alignments are available via figshare (10.6084/m9.figshare.5263885).,the aspen development repository is publicly available at https://github.com/naeglelab/aspen.

Recent work has shown that the remodeling acto-myosin network modifies local membrane organization, but the molecular details are only partly understood due to difficulties with experimentally accessing the relevant time and length scales. Here, we use interferometric scattering (iSCAT) microscopy to investigate a minimal acto-myosin network linked to a supported lipid bilayer membrane. Using the magnitude of the interferometric contrast, which is proportional to molecular mass, and fast acquisition rates, we detect, and image individual membrane attached actin filaments diffusing within the acto-myosin network and follow individual myosin II filament dynamics. We quantify myosin II filament dwell times and processivity as a function of ATP concentration, providing evidence for the predicted ensemble behavior of myosin head domains. Our results show how decreasing ATP concentrations lead to both increasing dwell times of individual myosin II filaments and a global change from a remodeling to a contractile state of the acto-myosin network.

Here, we explored the role of such intrinsic factors in shaping the gut microbiome of northern elephant seals during a critical developmental window of six weeks after weaning, when the pups stay ashore without feeding. We show that the early-life gut microbiome is already substantially different in male and female pups, even though males and females cannot yet be distinguished morphologically. Sex and age both explain around 15% of the variation in gut microbial beta diversity, while microbial communities sampled from the same individual show high levels of similarity across time, explaining another 40% of the variation. Only a small proportion of the variation in beta diversity is explained by health status, but healthy individuals have a greater microbial alpha diversity than their non-healthy peers. Across the post-weaning period, the elephant seal gut microbiome is highly dynamic. We found evidence for several colonisation and extinction events as well as a decline in Bacteriodes and an increase in Prevotella, a pattern that has previously been associated with the transition from nursing to solid food. Lastly, we show that genetic relatedness is correlated with gut microbiome similarity in males but not females, again reflecting substantial early sex-differences.

The mitochondrially-encoded RNA components of the mitochondrial ribosome require various post-transcriptional processing steps. Additional protein factors are required to facilitate the biogenesis of the functional mitoribosome. We have characterised a mitochondrially-localized protein, YbeY, which interacts with the assembling mitoribosome through the small subunit. Loss of YbeY leads to a severe reduction in mitochondrial translation and a loss of cell viability, caused by less accurate mitochondrial mt-tRNASer(AGY) processing from the primary transcript and an accumulation of immature mitochondrial small subunit. Our results suggest that YbeY performs a dual function in mitochondria coupling tRNA processing to mitoribosome biogenesis.

However, it remains unclear how bees respond to divergent sources of social information, and whether such social cues might modify bees’ natural preferences for non-social cues (e.g. flower colour), hence affecting foraging decisions. Here, we investigated honeybees’ (Apis mellifera) inspection and choices of unfamiliar flowers based on both natural colour preferences and simultaneous foraging information from conspecifics and heterospecifics. Individual honeybees’ preferences for flowers were recorded when the reward levels of a learned flower type had declined and novel-coloured flowers were available where they would find either no social information or one conspecific and one heterospecific (Bombus terrestris), each foraging from a different coloured flower (magenta or yellow). Honeybees showed a natural preference for magenta flowers. Honeybees modified their inspection of both types of flowers in response to conspecific and heterospecific social information. The presence of either demonstrator on the less-preferred yellow flower increased honeybees’ inspection of yellow flowers. Conspecific social information influenced observers’ foraging choices of yellow flowers, thus outweighing their original preference for magenta flowers. This effect was not elicited by heterospecific social information.

We previously developed a novel genetic crossing platform for the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum, an obligately sexual, hermaphroditic protozoan, using mice carrying human hepatocytes (the human liver-chimeric FRG NOD huHep mouse) as the vertebrate host. Here we examine the statistical power of two different genetic crosses - (1) between a laboratory parasite (NF54) of African origin and a patient-derived Asian parasite, and (2) between two sympatric patient-derived Asian parasites. We generated >140 unique recombinant clones over a 12-month period from the four parental genotypes, doubling the number of unique recombinant progeny generated in the previous 30 years. Both crosses show bi-parental inheritance of plastid markers amongst recombinant progeny, in contrast to previous crosses (conducted using chimpanzee hosts) which carried single dominant plastid genotypes. Both crosses show distinctive segregation patterns. The allopatric African/Asian cross has minimal levels of inbreeding (2% of clonal progeny are inbred) and extreme skews in marker segregation, while in the sympatric Asian cross, inbred progeny predominate (66% of clonal progeny are inbred) and parental alleles segregate evenly. Using simulations, we demonstrate that these progeny arrays (particularly the sympatric Asian cross) have excellent power to map large-effect mutations to a 31 kb interval and can capture complex, epistatic interactions that were far beyond the capacity of previous malaria crosses to detect. The extreme segregation distortion in the allopatric African/Asian cross erodes power to detect linkage in several genome regions, but the repeatable distortions observed offer promising alternative approaches to identifying genes underlying traits of interest. These crosses show surprising variation in marker segregation, nevertheless, the increased progeny numbers improve our ability to rapidly map biomedically important parasite traits.

Author SummaryUnderstanding how genome mutations contribute to newly emerging drug resistance in parasites like Plasmodium falciparum is important to monitor the spread of drug resistance. This scenario has been playing out in Southeast Asia with the emergence and spread of artemisinin resistance. Here we show that new P. falciparum genetic crosses, using mice carrying human liver cells and infused with human red blood cells (the human liver-chimeric FRG NOD huHep/huRBC mouse), provide an important new tool for understanding complex interactions underlying drug resistance phenotypes. We report two new genetic maps with 84 and 60 unique recombinant progeny, which doubles the number of progeny available from 4 previous P. falciparum genetic crosses. Through extensive simulations we show that with 84 progeny we can find association for a gene that controls only 20% of the variation in a phenotype. We also show that a cross generated from Southeast Asian parasites collected from the same geographic region have unique characteristics not previously observed in P. falciparum genetic crosses. This Southeast Asian cross exhibits even segregation across the genome, unbiased inheritance of mitochondria and apicoplast and higher levels of inbreeding than previously observed.",0,587,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.871830v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.871830v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_2019.12.13.871830.txt,0,NA,1,NA,the entire filtering  691  pipeline is available on github (https://github.com/kbuttons/p01_progenycharacterization) with  692  documentation.

These models are crucial to solving real world problems, such as antimicrobial resistance, pathogen detection, and protein evolution. Machine learning methods depend upon ground truth data to achieve specificity and sensitivity. Since the data is limited in this case, as we will show during the course of this paper, and as the size of available data increases super-linearly, it is of paramount importance to understand the distribution of ground truth data and the analyses it is suited and where it may have limitations that bias downstream learning methods. In this paper, we focus on training data required to model antimicrobial resistance (AR). We report an analysis of bacterial biochemical assay data associated with whole genome sequencing (WGS) from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and discuss important implications when making use of assay data, utilizing genetic features as training data for machine learning models. Complete discussion of machine learning model implementation is outside the scope of this paper and the subject to a later publication.

The antimicrobial assay data was obtained from NCBI BioSample, which contains descriptive information about the physical biological specimen from which experimental data is obtained and the results of those experiments themselves.[1] Assay data includes minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of antibiotics, links to associated microbial WGS data, and treatment of a particular microorganism with antibiotics.

We observe that there is minimal microbial data available for many antibiotics and for targeted taxonomic groups. The antibiotics with the highest number of assays have less than 1500 measurements each. Corresponding bias in available assays makes machine learning problematic for some important microbes and for building more advanced models that can work across microbial genera. In this study we focus, therefore, on the antibiotic with most assay data (tetracycline) and the corresponding genus with the most available sequence (Acinetobacter with 14000 measurements across 49 antibiotic compounds). Using this data for training and testing, we observed contradictions in the distribution of assay outcomes and report methods to identify and resolve such conflicts. Per antibiotic, we find that there can be up to 30% of (resolvable) conflicting measurements. As more data becomes available, automated training data curation will be an important part of creating useful machine learning models to predict antibiotic resistance.

Of note, Nrf1 was shown to be essential for regulating glycolysis pathway, but it is unknown whether it plays a role in cancer metabolic reprogramming, particularly in response to glucose starvation. Herein, we discover that Nrf1-/--derived hepatoma cells are sensitive to rapid death induced by glucose deprivation, such cell death appears to be rescued by Nrf2 interference, but Nrf1/2+/+ or Nrf2-/--derived cells are roughly unaffected by glucose starvation. Further evidence revealed that Nrf1-/- cell death is resulted from severe oxidative stress arising from abberrant redox metabolism. Strikingly, altered gluconeogenesis pathway was aggravated by glucose starvation of Nrf1-/- cells, as also accompanied by weakened pentose phosphate pathway, dysfunction of serine-to-glutathione synthesis, and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and damages, such that the intracellular GSH and NADPH were exhausted. These demonstrate that glucose starvation leads to acute death of Nrf1-/-, rather than Nrf2-/-, cells resulting from its fatal defects in the redox metabolism reprogramming. This is owing to distinct requirements of Nrf1 and Nrf2 for regulating key genes involved in the redox metabolic reprogramming. Altogether, this work substantiates the preventive and therapeutic strategies against Nrf1-deficient cancer by limiting its glucose and energy demands.",1,604,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.875369v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.875369v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2019.12.13.875369.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Pathologically, fibrosis is characterised by expansion of connective tissue due to excessive deposition of extracellular matrix proteins (ECM), including the fibrillar forms of collagen. A significant hurdle for discovering cures for fibrosis is the lack of suitable models and techniques to quantify mature collagen deposition in tissues. Here we have extensively characterized an ex-vivo cultured human lung derived, precision-cut lung slices model (hPCLS) using live fluorescence light microscopy as well as mass spectrometry-based techniques to obtain a proteomic and metabolomic fingerprint. Using an integrated approach of multiple readouts such as quantitative label-free Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging to measure fibrillar collagen in the extracellular matrix and ELISA-based methods to measure soluble ECM biomarkers, we investigated TGFbeta1-mediated pro-fibrotic signalling in hPCLS. We demonstrate that hPCLS are viable and metabolically active with mesenchymal, epithelial, endothelial, and immune cells surviving for at least two weeks in ex vivo culture. Analysis of hPCLS-conditioned supernatants showed strong induction of ECM synthesis proteins P1NP and fibronectin upon TGFb stimulation. Importantly, this effect translated into an increased deposition of fibrillar collagen in ECM of cultured hPCLS as measured by a novel quantitative SHG-based imaging method only following addition of a metalloproteinase inhibitor (GM6001). Together the data show that an integrated approach of measuring soluble pro-fibrotic markers and quantitative SHG-based analysis of fibrillar collagen is a valuable tool for studying pro-fibrotic signalling and testing anti-fibrotic agents.",1,682,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.875963v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.13.875963v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2019.12.13.875963.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In order to compensate for incomplete DNA replication at telomeres, most continually dividing cells, including many cancers, express the telomerase ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. Telomerase maintains telomere length by catalyzing de novo synthesis of short DNA repeats using an internal telomerase RNA (TR) template. TRs from diverse species harbor structurally conserved domains that contribute to RNP biogenesis and function. In vertebrate TRs, the conserved regions 4 and 5 (CR4/5) fold into a three-way junction (3WJ) that binds directly to the telomerase catalytic protein subunit and is required for telomerase function. We have analyzed the structural properties of the human TR (hTR) CR4/5 domain using a combination of in vitro chemical mapping, endogenous RNP assembly assays, and single-molecule structural analysis. Our data suggest that a functionally essential stem loop within CR4/5 is not stably folded in the absence of the telomerase reverse transcriptase protein subunit in vitro. Rather, the hTR CR4/5 domain adopts a heterogeneous ensemble of conformations. RNA structural engineering intended to bias the folding landscape of the hTR CR4/5 demonstrates that a stably folded 3WJ motif is necessary but not sufficient to promote assembly of a functional RNP complex. Finally, single-molecule measurements on the hTR CR4/5 domain show that RNP assembly selects for a conformation that is not the major population in the heterogeneous free RNA ensemble, suggesting that non-canonical hTR folds may be required during telomerase biogenesis.",1,747,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.876565v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.14.876565v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2019.12.14.876565.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

ESS originally measured relative power in family-based GWAS and has recently become important for correcting GWAS summary statistics in post-GWAS analyses. However, existing ESS approaches have been overlooked and based on empirical estimation. This work presents an analytical form of ESS in mixed-model GWAS of quantitative traits, which is derived using the expectation of quadratic form and validated in extensive simulations. We illustrate the performance and relevance of our ESS estimator in common GWAS scenarios and analytically show that (i) family-based studies are consistently underpowered compared to studies of unrelated individuals of the same sample size; (ii) conditioning on polygenic genetic effect by linear mixed models boosts power; and (iii) power of detecting gene-environment interaction can be substantially gained or lost in family-based designs depending on exposure distribution. We further analyze UK Biobank dataset in two samples of 336,347 unrelated and 68,910 related individuals. Analysis in unrelated individuals reveals a high accuracy of our ESS estimator compared to the existing empirical approach; and analysis of related individuals suggests that the loss in effective sample size due to relatedness is at most 0.94x.

Commonly, such forecasts are made based on conservation status assessments produced by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). However, when researchers apply these IUCN conservation status data for predicting future extinctions, important information is often omitted, which can impact the accuracy of these predictions.

Here we present a new approach and a software for simulating future extinctions based on IUCN conservation status information, which incorporates generation length information of individual species when modeling extinction risks. Additionally, we explicitly model future changes in conservation status for each species, based on status transition rates that we estimate from the IUCN assessment history of the last decades. Finally, we apply a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate extinction rates for each species, based on the simulated future extinctions. These estimates inherently incorporate the chances of conservation status changes and the generation length for each given species and are specific to the simulated time frame.

We demonstrate the utility of our approach by estimating extinction rates for all bird species. Our average extinction risk estimate for the next 100 years across all birds is 6.98 x 10-4 extinctions per species-year, and we predict an expected biodiversity loss of between 669 to 738 bird species within that time frame. Further, the rate estimates between species sharing the same IUCN status show larger variation than the rates estimated with alternative approaches, which reflects expected differences in extinction risk among taxa of the same conservation status.

Both activities are featured as indiscriminate nucleic acid cleavage and subjected to the spatiotemporal regulation. To yield further insights into the involved mechanisms, we reconstituted LdCsm, a lactobacilli III-A system in Escherichia coli. Upon activation by target RNA, this immune system mediates robust DNA degradation but lacks the synthesis of cyclic oligoadenylates. Mutagenesis of the Csm3 and Cas10 conserved residues revealed that Csm3 and multiple structural domains in Cas10 function in the allosteric regulation to yield an active enzyme. Target RNAs carrying various truncations in the 3' anti-tag were designed and tested for their influence on DNA binding and DNA cleavage of LdCsm. Three distinct ternary LdCsm complexes were identified. In particular, binding of target RNAs carrying a single nucleotide in the 3' anti-tag to LdCsm yielded an active LdCsm DNase regardless whether the nucleotide shows a mismatch, as in the cognate target RNA (CTR), or a match in the noncognate target RNAs (NTR), to the 5 tag of crRNA. In addition, further increasing the number of 3' anti-tag in CTR facilitated the substrate binding and enhanced the substrate degradation whereas doing the same as in NTR gradually decreased the substrate binding and eventually shut off the DNA cleavage by the enzyme.

Triplicate biological samples of exponential growth, stationary phase, and static biofilm samples were examined. DESeq2 and Rockhopper were used to identify robust and widespread shifts in gene expression the transcriptomic signals specific to each growth phase. Weidentified 1711 protein coding genes (28%) using DESeq2 that had altered expression greater than 2-fold specifically in biofilms compared to exponential growth. Fewer genes were specifically differentially expressed in stationary phase culture (757, 12%). A small set of genes (103/6020) were differentially expressed in opposing fashions in biofilm and stationary phase, indicating potentially substantial shifts in phenotype. Gene Ontology analysis showed that the only class of genes specifically upregulated in biofilms were associated with nutrient transport, highlighting the importance of nutrient uptake in the biofilm. The biofilm specific genes did not overlap substantially with the loci identified by mutagenesis studies, although some were present in both sets. The most highly upregulated biofilm specific gene is predicted to be a part of the RNA degradosome, which indicates that RNA stability is used to regulate the biofilm phenotype. Two small putative proteins, Varpa_0407 and Varpa_3832, are highly expressed specifically in biofilms and are predicted to be secreted DNA binding proteins, that may stabilize extracellular DNA as a component of the biofilm matrix. An flp/tad type IV pilus locus (Varpa_5148-60) is strongly downregulated in specifically in biofilms, in contrast with results from other systems for these pili.

Though sex determination is regulated differently in the germline versus the soma, Sxl is also necessary and sufficient for the female identity in germ cells. Loss of Sxl function in the germline results in ovarian germline tumors, a characteristic of male germ cells developing in a female soma. Further, XY (male) germ cells expressing Sxl are able to produce eggs when transplanted into XX (female) somatic gonads, demonstrating that Sxl is also sufficient for female sexual identity in the germline. As in the soma, the presence of two X chromosomes is sufficient to activate Sxl in the germline, but the mechanism for ""counting"" X chromosomes in the germline is thought to be different from the soma. Here we have explored this mechanism at both cis- and trans-levels. Our data support the model that the Sxl ""establishment"" promoter (SxlPE) is activated in a female-specific manner in the germline, as in the soma, but that the timing of SxlPE activation, and the DNA elements that regulate SxlPE are different from those in the soma. Nevertheless, we find that the X chromosome-encoded gene sisterless A (sisA), which helps activate Sxl in the soma, is also essential for Sxl activation in the germline. Loss of sisA function leads to loss of Sxl expression in the germline, and to ovarian tumors and germline loss. These defects can be rescued by the expression of Sxl, demonstrating that sisA lies upstream of Sxl in germline sex determination. We conclude that sisA acts as an X chromosome counting element in both the soma and the germline, but that additional factors that ensure robust, female-specific expression of Sxl in the germline remain to be discovered.",0,358,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.17.880070v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.17.880070v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2019.12.17.880070.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The transcriptome of virus-infected Malassezia restricta cells was compared to that of virus-cured cells, and the results showed that transcripts involved in ribosomal biosynthesis were downregulated and those involved in energy production and programmed cell death were upregulated. Moreover, transmission electron microscopy revealed significantly larger vacuoles in virus-infected M. restricta cells, indicating that MrV40 infection dramatically altered M. restricta physiology. Our analysis also revealed that viral nucleic acid from MrV40 induced a TLR3-mediated inflammatory immune response in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells, suggesting that a viral element contributes to the pathogenicity of Malassezia.

The chromatin dynamics and regulatory networks that drive human SI lineage formation and regional patterning are essentially unknown. To fill this knowledge void, we apply a cutting-edge genomic technology to a state-of-the-art human model of early SI development. Specifically, we leverage chromatin run-on sequencing (ChRO-seq) to define the landscape of active promoters, enhancers, super enhancers, and gene bodies across distinct stages of directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into SI spheroids with regional specification.

ResultsThrough comprehensive ChRO-seq analysis we identify candidate stage-specific chromatin activity states, novel markers, and enhancer hotspots during the directed differentiation process. Moreover, we propose a detailed transcriptional network associated with SI lineage formation or initial regional patterning. Among our findings is a unique pattern of enhancer activity and transcription at HOX gene loci that is previously undescribed. Analysis of single cell RNA-seq data from human fetal SI at early developmental time points shed further light on the unique HOX gene temporal dynamics that underlies SI regional patterning.

A key component of these droplets are multi-valent proteins that possess several adhesive domains with specific interaction partners (whose number determines total valency of the protein) separated by disordered regions. Here, using multi-scale simulations we show that such proteins self-organize into micro-phase separated droplets of various sizes as opposed to the Flory-like macro-phase separated equilibrium state of homopolymers or equilibrium physical gels. We show that the micro-phase separated state is a dynamic outcome of the interplay between two competing processes: a diffusion-limited encounter between proteins, and the dynamics within small clusters that results in exhaustion of available valencies whereby all specifically interacting domains find their interacting partners within smaller clusters, leading to arrested phase separation. We first model these multi-valent chains as bead-spring polymers with multiple adhesive domains separated by semi-flexible linkers and use Langevin Dynamics (LD) to assess how key timescales depend on the molecular properties of associating polymers. Using the time-scales from LD simulations, we develop a coarse-grained kinetic model to study this phenomenon at longer times. Consistent with LD simulations, the macro-phase separated state was only observed at high concentrations and large interaction valencies. Further, in the regime where cluster sizes approach macro-phase separation, the condensed phase becomes dynamically solid-like, suggesting that it might no longer be biologically functional. Therefore, the micro-phase separated state could be a hallmark of functional droplets formed by proteins with the sticker-spacer architecture.

Significance statementMembraneless organells (MO) are ubiquitous in  healthy living cells, with an altered state in disease. Their formation is likened to liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) between MO-forming proteins. However most models of LLPS predict complete macrophase separation while in reality MOs are small droplets of various sizes, which are malleable to rapid morphological changes. Here we present a microscopic multiscale theoretical study of thermodynamics and kinetics of formation of MO. We show that MOs are long-living dynamic structures formed as a result of arrested macrophase separation.

While a brief exposure to the conditioned stimulus (CS) can trigger reconsolidation of the original memory, a prolonged CS exposure will trigger memory extinction. The conditioned response is maintained after reconsolidation, but is inhibited after extinction, presumably by the formation of a new inhibitory memory trace. In rats and humans, it has been shown that CS exposure of intermediate duration leave the memory in an insensitive or limbo state. Limbo is characterised by the absence of reconsolidation or extinction. Here we investigated the evolutionary conserved nature of limbo using a contextual Pavlovian conditioning (CPC) memory paradigm in the crab Neohelice granulata. In animals with fully consolidated CPC memory, systemic administration of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide after 1 CS presentation disrupted the memory, presumably by interfering with memory reconsolidation. The same intervention given after 320 CSs prevented CPC memory extinction. Cycloheximide had no behavioural effect when administered after 80 CS presentations, a protocol that failed to extinguish CPC memory. Also, we observed that a stronger CPC memory engaged reconsolidation after 80 CS instead of limbo, indicating that memory strength affects the parametrical conditions to engage either reconsolidation or limbo. Altogether, these results indicate that limbo is an evolutionary conserved memory process segregating reconsolidation from extinction in the number of CSs space. Limbo appears as an intrinsic component of retrieval dependent memory processing, with a key function in the transition from memory maintenance to inhibition.

As these memories become remote, they are believed to rely more heavily on cortical structures within the prefrontal cortex (PFC), where they lose much of their contextual detail and become schematized. Odor is a particularly evocative cue for intense remote memory recall and despite these memories being remote, they are highly contextual. In instances such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), intense remote memory recall can occur years after trauma, which seemingly contradicts SC. We hypothesized that odor may shift the organization of salient or fearful memories such that when paired with an odor at the time of encoding, they are delayed in the de-contextualization process that occurs across time, and retrieval may still rely on the HPC, where memories are imbued with contextually rich information, even at remote time points. We investigated this by tagging odor- and non-odor-associated fear memories in male c57BL/6 mice and assessed recall and c-Fos expression in the dorsal CA1 (dCA1) and prelimbic cortex (PL) 1 d or 21 d later. In support of SC, our data showed that recent memories were more dCA1-dependent whereas remote memories were more PL-dependent. However, we also found that odor influenced this temporal dynamic biasing the memory system from the PL to the dCA1 when odor cues were present. Behaviorally, inhibiting the dCA1 with activity-dependent DREADDs had no effect on recall at 1 d and unexpectedly caused an increase in freezing at 21 d. Together, these findings demonstrate that odor can shift the organization of fear memories at the systems level.",1,477,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.881615v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.881615v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2019.12.19.881615.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In response, the DPO-VqmA complex activates transcription of the vqmR gene encoding the VqmR small RNA. VqmR represses genes required for biofilm formation and virulence factor production. Here, we show that VqmA has DPO-dependent and DPO-independent activity.

Known pathotypes of E. fawcettii are based on host range; additionally, cryptic pathotypes have been reported and more novel pathotypes are thought to exist. E. fawcettii produces elsinochrome, a non-host selective toxin which contributes to virulence. However, the mechanisms involved in potential pathogen-host interactions occurring prior to the production of elsinochrome are unknown, yet the host-specificity observed among pathotypes suggests a reliance upon such mechanisms. In this study we have generated a whole genome sequencing project for E. fawcettii, producing an annotated draft assembly 26.01 Mb in size, with 10,080 predicted gene models and low (0.37%) coverage of transposable elements. The assembly showed evidence of AT-rich regions, potentially indicating genomic regions with increased plasticity. Using a variety of computational tools, we mined the E. fawcettii genome for potential virulence genes as candidates for future investigation. A total of 1,280 secreted proteins and 203 candidate effectors were predicted and compared to those of other necrotrophic (Botrytis cinerea, Parastagonospora nodorum, Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and Zymoseptoria tritici), hemibiotrophic (Leptosphaeria maculans, Magnaporthe oryzae, Rhynchosporium commune and Verticillium dahliae) and biotrophic (Ustilago maydis) plant pathogens. Genomic and proteomic features of known fungal effectors were analysed and used to guide the prioritisation of 77 candidate effectors of E. fawcettii. Additionally, 378 carbohydrate-active enzymes were predicted and analysed for likely secretion and sequence similarity with known virulence genes. Furthermore, secondary metabolite prediction indicated nine additional genes potentially involved in the elsinochrome biosynthesis gene cluster than previously described. A further 21 secondary metabolite clusters were predicted, some with similarity to known toxin producing gene clusters.

Plants regulate the macro-organization of photosynthetic complexes within the thylakoid membrane to adapt to changing environmental conditions and avoid oxidative stress. One such mechanism is the state transition which regulates photosynthetic light harvesting and electron transfer. State transitions are driven by changes in the phosphorylation of light harvesting antenna complex II (LHCII), which cause a decrease in grana diameter and stacking, a decreased energetic connectivity between photosystem II (PSII) reaction centres and an increase in the relative LHCII antenna size of photosystem I (PSI) compared to PSII. Phosphorylation is believed to drive these changes by weakening the intra-membrane lateral PSII-LHCII and LHCII-LHCII interactions and the inter-membrane stacking interactions between these complexes, while simultaneously increasing the affinity of LHCII for PSI. We investigated the relative roles and contributions of these three types of interaction to state transitions using a lattice-based model of the thylakoid membrane based on existing structural data, developing a novel algorithm to simulate protein complex dynamics. Monte Carlo simulations revealed that state transitions are unlikely to lead to a large-scale migration of LHCII from the grana to the stromal lamellae. Instead, the increased light harvesting capacity of PSI is largely due to the more efficient recruitment of LHCII already residing in the stromal lamellae into PSI-LHCII supercomplexes upon its phosphorylation. Likewise, the increased light harvesting capacity of PSII upon dephosphorylation was found to be driven by a more efficient recruitment of LHCII already residing in the grana into functional PSII-LHCII clusters, primarily driven by lateral interactions.

Statement of significanceFor photosynthesis to operate at maximum efficiency the activity of the light-driven chlorophyll-protein complexes, photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII) must be fine-tuned to environmental conditions. Plants achieve this balance through a regulatory mechanism known as the state transition, which modulates the relative light-harvesting antenna size and therefore excitation rate of each photosystem. State transitions are driven by changes in the extent of the phosphorylation of light harvesting complex II (LHCII), which modulate the interactions between PSI, PSII and LHCII. Here we developed a novel algorithm to simulate protein complex dynamics and then ran Monte Carlo simulations to understand how these interactions cooperate to affect the organization of the photosynthetic membrane and bring about state transitions.",1,628,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.882886v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.19.882886v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2019.12.19.882886.txt,0,NA,1,NA,233  code availability  234  source code is freely available under a creative commons license at  235  https://github.com/whjwood/thylakoid_model.

For instance, the well-known frequency-following response (FFR) of the auditory midbrain, as measured with electroencephalography (EEG), is dominated by frequencies from [~]100 Hz to several hundred Hz, phase-locking to the acoustic stimulus at those frequencies. In contrast, cortical responses, whether measured by EEG or magnetoencephalography (MEG), are typically characterized by frequencies of a few Hz to a few tens of Hz, time-locking to acoustic envelope features. In this study we investigated a crossover case, cortically generated responses time-locked to continuous speech features at FFR-like rates. Using MEG, we analyzed responses in the high gamma range of 70-200 Hz to continuous speech using neural source-localized reverse correlation and the corresponding temporal response functions (TRFs). Continuous speech stimuli were presented to 40 subjects (17 younger, 23 older adults) with clinically normal hearing and their MEG responses were analyzed in the 70-200 Hz band. Consistent with the relative insensitivity of MEG to many subcortical structures, the spatiotemporal profile of these response components indicated a cortical origin with [~]40 ms peak latency and a right hemisphere bias. TRF analysis was performed using two separate aspects of the speech stimuli: a) the 70-200 Hz carrier of the speech, and b) the 70-200 Hz temporal modulations in the spectral envelope of the speech stimulus. The response was dominantly driven by the envelope modulation, with a much weaker contribution from the carrier. Age-related differences were also analyzed to investigate a reversal previously seen along the ascending auditory pathway, whereby older listeners show weaker midbrain FFR responses than younger listeners, but, paradoxically, have stronger cortical low frequency responses. In contrast to both these earlier results, this study did not find clear age-related differences in high gamma cortical responses to continuous speech. Cortical responses at FFR-like frequencies shared some properties with midbrain responses at the same frequencies and with cortical responses at much lower frequencies.

While multiple risk factors are involved in the disease, its precise etiology remains unclear and the effectiveness of the current control strategies still highly variable. However, and even if the main role of Treponema spp. in the development of the disease is consistently recognized, the importance of other bacterial communities and the factors affecting the skin environment remains uncertain. The objective of this study was to investigate the dynamics of microbiotas from feet affected by DD, before and after the implementation of disinfectant footbaths under field conditions. During this investigation, the diversity, structure, and composition of microbiotas from DD lesions over time were explored according to different clinical factors. The findings of this investigation confirmed a particular microbiota related to DD lesions dominated by Treponema spp. and highly different from those microbiotas of healthy skin. However, the diversity and structure of microbiotas from DD lesions did not vary according to the usage of footbaths or individual topical antibiotic treatments. Otherwise, microbiotas from proliferative lesions evidenced a different structure and diversity in comparison to non-proliferative lesions. The composition of microbiotas changed over time revealing the potential main role of Treponema spp., Fusobacterium spp., Mycoplasma spp. and Porphyromonas spp. in the dynamics of DD lesion progression. Further studies are necessaries to confirm if the clinical evolution of DD lesions is driven by a particular microbiota and how this microbiota induces disease.

The subject of the study was an open-pollinated cultivar (Casoar) and a restored hybrid cultivar (Visby). Three plant protection programmes, two levels of spring nitrogen fertilisation (160 and 220 kg N{middle dot}ha-1), and two different seeding rates for each cultivar (Visby--50 and 70 seeds{middle dot}m-2; Casoar--60 and 80 seeds{middle dot}m-2) were included. The most intensive protection programme comprised three fungicide treatments: first in autumn at the six-leaves-unfolded stage--BBCH 16, second in spring at the stem elongation stage--BBCH 33, and third at the full flowering stage--BBCH 65. One of two less intensive programmes of plant protection included fungicide application in autumn at the six-leaves-unfolded stage--BBCH 16 and at the full flowering stage--BBCH 65, while the second included fungicide application in spring at the stem elongation stage--BBCH 33 and at the full flowering stage--BBCH 65.

The effectiveness of the protection programmes and nitrogen fertilisation was influenced by the intensity of abiotic stress factors. However, the average yield from the plots protected against pathogens was significantly higher than that from the untreated plots. The increase of nitrogen fertilisation from 160 to 220 kg{middle dot}ha-1 also caused significant increase of average seed yield.

To clarify the microscopic mechanism of primary proton transfer from retinal Schiff base (SB) to Asp85 in BR, herein we performed quantum-mechanical metadynamics simulations of the whole BR system ([~]3800 atoms). The simulations showed a novel proton transfer mechanism, viz. hydroxide ion mechanism, in which the deprotonation of specific internal water (Wat452) yields the protonation of Asp85 via Thr89, after which the resulting hydroxide ion accepts the remaining proton from retinal SB. Furthermore, systematic investigations adopting four sequential snapshots obtained by the time-resolved serial femtosecond crystallography revealed that proton transfer took 2-5.25 s on the photocycle. The presence of Wat401, which is the main difference between snapshots at 2 and 5.25 s, is found to be essential in assisting the primary proton transfer.

SIGNIFICANCEBacteriorhodopsin (BR), the benchmark of light-driven proton pumps, has attracted much attention from diverse areas in terms of energy conversion. Despite the significant experimental and theoretical efforts, the microscopic mechanism of the proton transfers in BR is not completely unveiled. In this study, quantum-mechanical molecular dynamics simulations of whole BR system were performed to elucidate the primary proton transfer in the L intermediate state with the latest snapshots obtained from X-ray free electron laser. As a result, it is found that the hydroxide ion originating from the specific internal water, which appears at the active site only in the L state, acts as a carrier for the primary proton transfer, demonstrating the importance of hydroxide ions in proton pumps.",1,354,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.23.887216v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.23.887216v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2019.12.23.887216.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here we present our workflow that assessed processing, solubility and relative abundance of 16 Klebsiella oxytoca Nif proteins targeted to the plant mitochondrial matrix using an Arabidopsis mitochondrial targeting peptide (MTP). The functional consequence of the N-terminal modifications required for mitochondrial targeting of Nif proteins was tested using bacterial nitrogenase assays. We found that despite the use of the same constitutive promoter and MTP, MTP::Nif processing and relative abundance in plant leaf varied considerably. Assessment of solubility for all MTP::Nif proteins found NifF, M, N, S, U, W, X, Y and Z were soluble, while NifB, E, H, J, K, Q and V were mostly insoluble. Although most Nif proteins tolerated the N-terminal extension as a consequence of mitochondrial processing, this extension in NifM reduced nitrogenase activity to 10% of controls. Using proteomics, we detected a [~]50-fold increase in the abundance of NifM when it contained the N-terminal MTP extension, which may account for this reduction seen in nitrogenase activity. Based on plant mitochondrial processing and solubility, and retention of function in a bacterial assay, our workflow has identified that NifF, N, S, U, W, Y and Z satisfied all these criteria.

A polymorphic codon 129 of human PrP that is valine (V129) or methionine (M129) is particularly influential on properties of PrPSc, affecting transmission efficiencies and clinicopathological features. However, how the single residue is so influential has not been elucidated because the detailed structures of PrPSc have not been determined yet due to its incompatibility with high-resolution structural analysis. Previously we created an in-register parallel {beta}-sheet local structural model of human PrPSc encompassing residues 107 to 143 that seemed more compatible with V129 than M129, based on knowledge from -synuclein amyloids and an NMR-based model of the amyloid of Y145Stop mutant of PrP in the literature. Here, we created an M129-compatible local structural model of PrPSc. Severe destabilization of the model by G127V mutation was consistent with the protective effects of V127 polymorphism of human PrP against prions. It was highly sensitive to the length of the hydrophobic side chain of codon 129 and replacement of M129 with leucine or valine destabilized the structures. Interestingly, the U-shaped {beta}-arch which comprises M129 flexibly changed hydrophobic interaction networks inside the {beta}-arch depending on the interactions with the surrounding structures, whereas the previous model with V129 maintained the similar network patterns irrespective of the surroundings.

During the catalytic cycle of EcTPx, the peroxidatic cysteine (CP) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by peroxide, then the resolving cysteine (CR) condenses with the sulfenic acid of CP to form a disulfide bond, which is finally reduced by thioredoxin. Purified EcTPx as dithiol and disulfide behaves as a monomer in close to physiological conditions. Although secondary structure rearrangements are present when comparing different redox states of the enzyme, no significant differences in unfolding free energies are observed under reducing and oxidizing conditions. A conformational change denominated fully folded (FF) to locally unfolded (LU) transition, involving a partial unfolding of H2 and H3 helices, must occur to enable the formation of the disulfide bond since the catalytic cysteines are 12 [A] apart in the FF conformation of EcTPx. To explore this crucial process, the mechanism of the FF[-&gt;]LU and the LU[-&gt;]FF transitions were studied using long time scale conventional molecular dynamic simulations and an enhanced conformational sampling technique for different oxidation and protonation states of CP and/or CR.

Elevated presynaptic Na+ accelerated both slow and rapid forms of endocytosis and facilitated endocytosis overshoot but did not affect the readily releasable pool size, Ca2+ influx, or exocytosis. To examine whether this facilitation of endocytosis is related to the Na+-dependent vesicular content change, we dialyzed increasing concentrations of glutamate into the presynaptic cytosol or blocked the vesicular glutamate uptake with bafilomycin and found the rate of endocytosis was not affected by regulating the glutamate content in the presynaptic terminal. Endocytosis is critically dependent on intracellular Ca2+, and the activity of Na+/Ca2+ exchanger (NCX) may be altered when the Na+ gradient is changed. However, neither NCX blocker nor change of extracellular Na+ concentration affected the endocytosis rate.

Participants filled out self-reported questionnaires (the Profile of Mood States, Beck Depression Inventory, and Big Five Inventory) and reported ASMR estimates throughout a 17-min experiment while listening to binaural tapping and brushing sounds. Cross-correlation results showed that the ASMR estimates were strongly associated with the acoustic features of auditory stimuli, such as their amplitude, spectral centroid, and spectral bandwidth. This indicates that low-pitched sounds with dark timbre trigger the ASMR. The maximum ASMR was observed around 2 s after the acoustic features changed, suggesting that the sluggishness of multisensory integration may lead to the ASMR experience. In addition, individual differences in the ASMR experience were closely linked to participants mood states, such as anxiety, but not to their personality traits.

However, annual killifish live in temporary ponds with a limited time period available for growth and reproduction. It has therefore been hypothesized that among annual killifish, hatchling size variation should be of large relative importance to generate adaptive adult size variation. Using growth curves of 203 individuals from 18 Austrolebias species raised in a common environment, we demonstrate that hatchling size variation indeed is a main determinant of adult size variation in annual killifish, in agreement with the time constraint hypothesis. Furthermore, we find an increased early growth rate in piscivorous species augmenting their difference in size from small congeneric species. This should be adaptive if size differences determine predation success. Environmental effects of spatial location of the population of origin on hatchling size and growth suggest that the time constraint might be weakened in populations occurring near the Atlantic coast.

Cardiovascular complications are the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with MPNs. The acquired kinase mutation JAK2V617F plays a central role in these disorders. Mechanisms responsible for cardiovascular dysfunction in MPNs are not fully understood, limiting the effectiveness of current treatment.

ObjectiveVascular endothelial cells (ECs) play critical roles in the regulation of hemostasis and thrombosis. ECs carrying the JAK2V617F mutation can be detected in patients with MPNs. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that the JAK2V617F mutation alters endothelial function to promote cardiovascular complications in patients with MPNs.

Methods and ResultsWe employed murine models of MPN in which the JAK2V617F mutation is expressed in specific cell lineages. When JAK2V617F is expressed in both blood cells and vascular ECs, the mice developed MPN and spontaneous, age-related dilated cardiomyopathy with an increased risk of sudden death as well as a prothrombotic and vasculopathy phenotype on histology evaluation. We showed that JAK2V617F-mutant ECs are required for this cardiovascular disease phenotype and the mutation can alter endothelial cell function. Finally, in a more therapeutically oriented approach, we demonstrated that transplantation with wild-type donor marrow cells can improve cardiac function by reversing the left ventricle remodeling process in this JAK2V617F-positive MPN murine model.

ConclusionsThese findings suggest that the JAK2V617F mutation alters vascular endothelial function to promote cardiovascular complications in MPNs. Therefore, targeting the MPN vasculature represents a promising new therapeutic strategy for patients with MPNs.",1,434,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.891721v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2019.12.31.891721v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_2019.12.31.891721.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

This formula is written in terms of the magnitudes of the heterogeneities, as quantified by their coefficients of variation, and the correlation between them. A natural question to ask is whether analogous results apply when there are multiple sources of variation in susceptibility and/or infectiousness. In this paper we demonstrate that with three or more coupled heterogeneities, R0 under separable transmission depends on details of the distribution of the heterogeneities in a way that is not seen in the well-known simpler situation. We provide explicit formulae for the cases of multivariate normal and multivariate log-normal distributions, showing that R0 can again be expressed in terms of the magnitudes of the heterogeneities and the pairwise correlations between them. The formulae, however, differ between the two multivariate distributions, demonstrating that no formula of this type applies generally when there are three or more coupled heterogeneities. We see that the results of the formulae are approximately equal when heterogeneities are relatively small and show that an earlier result in the literature (Koella, 1991) should be viewed in this light. We provide numerical illustrations of our results and discuss a setting in which coupled heterogeneities are likely to have a major impact on the value of R0. We also describe a rather surprising result: in a system with three heterogeneities, R0 can exhibit non-monotonic behavior with increasing levels of heterogeneity, in marked contrast to the familiar two heterogeneity setting in which R0 either increases or decreases with increasing heterogeneity.",1,6,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/220004v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/220004v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_220004.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

To accomplish this, cells have evolved methods to measure the presence and concentration of these small molecules in their environment and enact changes in gene expression or behavior. However, cells don’t usually change their DNA in response to such outside stimuli. In this work, we have engineered a genetic circuit that can enact specific and controlled genetic changes in response to changing small molecule concentrations. Known DNA sequences can be repeatedly integrated into a genomic array such that their identity and order encodes information about past small molecule concentrations that the cell has experienced. To accomplish this, we use catalytically inactive CRISPR-Cas9 (dCas9) to bind to and block attachment sites for the integrase Bxb1. Therefore, through the co-expression of dCas9 and guide RNA, Bxb1 can be directed to integrate one of two engineered plasmids, which correspond to two orthogonal small molecule inducers that can be recorded with this system. We identified the optimal location of guide RNA binding to the Bxb1 attP integrase attachment site, and characterized the detection limits of the system by measuring the minimal small molecule concentration and shortest induction time necessary to produce measurable differences in array composition as read out by Oxford Nanopore long read sequencing technology.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",0,11,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/225151v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/225151v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_225151.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Spatially-explicit models of ecosystems suggest that loss of such power-law clustering may indicate loss of ecosystem resilience. Hence, it is hypothesised that spatial clustering properties in ecosystems - which can be readily measured using remotely-sensed high-resolution data - can help infer proximity to ecosystem thresholds and may even provide early warning signals of ecosystem collapse. Recent empirical and simulation studies, however, dont find consistent relationships between spatial clustering and ecosystem resilience. Furthermore, how spatial clustering metrics relate to other well-known early warning signals of ecosystems collapse, specifically the phenomenon of critical slowing down (CSD), remains unclear.
C_LIO_LIWe synthesize the literature on cluster sizes in empirical and theoretical studies that show how local interactions (especially, positive feedback) among organisms can cause power-law clustering. In addition, we analyse a minimal spatial model of ecosystem transitions that allows us to disentangle the role of environmental stressor and positive feedback on spatial patterns and ecosystem resilience.
C_LIO_LIOur literature synthesis reveals that empirically observed power-law clustering in ecosystems is parsimoniously explained by local positive feedback. Our synthesis together with model analysis demonstrates that, depending on the strength of positive feedback, emergence of power-law clustering can occur at any distance from the critical threshold of ecosystem collapse. In fact, we find that for systems with strong positive feedbacks, which are most likely to exhibit abrupt transitions, loss of power-law clustering may not even occur prior to ecosystem thresholds. We also argue that cluster-size distributions are unrelated to the phenomenon of CSD.
C_LIO_LIWe demonstrate that, due to CSD, a power-law feature does occur near critical thresholds but in a different quantity; specifically, a power-law decay of spatial correlations of ecosystem state.
C_LIO_LIWe conclude that loss of power-law clustering cannot be used as a reliable indicator of ecosystem resilience. Our synthesis and model analyses highlights links between local positive feedback, emergent spatial properties and how they may be used to interpret ecosystem resilience.

Through the mining of MS data for the collective dynamic signatures of the kinases substrates revealed by correlation analysis of phosphopeptide intensity data, the tool infers KSAs in the data for the considerable body of substrates lacking such annotations. We benchmarked the tool against existing approaches for predicting KSAs that rely on static information (e.g. sequences, structures and interactions) using publically available MS data, including breast, colon, and ovarian cancer models. The benchmarking reveals that co-phosphorylation analysis can significantly improve prediction performance when static information is available (about 35% of sites) while providing reliable predictions for the remainder, thus tripling the KSAs available from the experimental MS data providing a to comprehensive and reliable characterization of the landscape of kinase-substrate interactions well beyond current limitations.

Author SummaryKinases play an important role in cellular regulation and have emerged as an important class of drug targets for many diseases, particularly cancers. Comprehensive identification of the links between kinases and their substrates enhances our ability to understand the underlying mechanism of diseases and signalling networks to drive drug discovery. Most of the current computational methods for prediction of kinase-substrate associations use static information such as sequence motifs and physical interactions to generate predictions. However, phosphorylation is a dynamic process and these static predictions may overlook unique features of cellular context, where kinases may be rewired. In this manuscript, we propose a computational method, CoPhosK, which uses the mass spectrometry based phosphoproteomics data to predict the kinase for all identified phosphosites in the experiment.

Previous studies detected selection signals in several human pigmentation genes, but few studies have integrated contribution from multiple genes to the evolution of human pigmentation. Moreover, none has quantified selective pressures on human pigmentation over epochs and between populations. Here, we dissect dynamics and differences of selective pressures during different periods and between distinct populations with new approaches. We propose a new model with multiple populations to estimate historical selective pressures by summarizing selective pressures on multiple genes. We use genotype data of 19 genes associated with human pigmentation from 17 datasets, and obtain data for 2346 individuals of six representative population groups from worldwide. Our results quantify selective pressures on light pigmentation not only in modern Europeans (0.0249/generation) but also in proto-Eurasians (0.00665/generation). Our results also support several derived alleles associated with human dark pigmentation may under directional selection by quantifying differences of selective pressures between populations. Our study provides a first attempt to quantitatively investigate the dynamics of selective pressures during different time periods in the evolution of human pigmentation, and may facilitate studies of the evolution of other complex traits.\n\nAuthor SummaryThe color variation of human skin, hair, and eye is affected by multiple genes with different roles. This diversity may be shaped by natural selection and adapted for ultraviolet radiation in different environments around the world. As human populations migrated out from Africa, the ultraviolet radiation in the environment they encountered also changed. It is possible that the selective pressures on human pigmentation varied throughout human evolutionary history. In this study, we develop a new approach and estimate historical selective pressures on light pigmentation not only in modern Europeans but also in proto-Eurasians.

However, the description of the tradeoffs between simulation efficiency and error in FFS remains incomplete. We present a novel and mathematically rigorous analysis of the errors in FFS that, for the first time, covers the contribution of every phase of the simulation. We derive a closed form expression for the optimally efficient count of samples to take in each FFS phase in terms of a fixed constraint on sampling error. We introduce a new method, forward flux pilot sampling (FFPilot), that is designed to take full advantage of our optimizing equation without prior information or assumptions about the phase weights and costs along the transition path. In simulations of both single- and multi-dimensional gene regulatory networks, FFPilot is able to completely control sampling error. Higher dimensional systems have additional sources of error and we show that this extra error can be traced to correlations between phases due to roughness on the probability landscape. Finally, we show that in sets of simulations with matched error, FFPilot is on the order of tens-to-hundreds of times faster than direct sampling, in a fashion that scales with the rarity of the events.",1,11,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/254896v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/254896v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_254896.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We here set out to understand how differences in CKD origin are reflected in gene expression. To this end, we integrated publicly available human glomerular microarray gene expression data for nine kidney disease entities that account for a majority of CKD worldwide. We included data from five distinct studies and compared glomerular gene expression profiles to that of non-tumor parts of kidney cancer nephrectomy tissues. A major challenge was the integration of the data from different sources, platforms and conditions, that we mitigated with a bespoke stringent procedure. This allowed us to perform a global transcriptome-based delineation of different kidney disease entities, obtaining a landscape of their similarities and differences based on the genes that acquire a consistent differential expression between each kidney disease entity and nephrectomy tissue. Furthermore, we derived functional insights by inferring activity of signaling pathways and transcription factors from the collected gene expression data, and identified potential drug candidates based on expression signature matching. We validated representative findings by immunostaining in human kidney biopsies indicating e.g. that the transcription factor FOXM1 is significantly and specifically expressed in parietal epithelial cells in RPGN whereas not expressed in control kidney tissue. These results provide a foundation to comprehend the specific molecular mechanisms underlying different kidney disease entities, that can pave the way to identify biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets.

The primary objective was to use a validated lab tool, the five-item odor identification test, to assess variation in olfactory ability in different environments.

MethodsUsing the five-item test, we conducted two repeated measures experiments that assessed participant ability to correctly identify an odor source in different odor environments. We also examined consistency in odor labelling due to documented potential bias from idiosyncrasies in odor terms.

ResultsWe found no variation in olfactory ability due to environment, but this may be due to methodological biases. First, subjective bias results from idiosyncratic differences in participant labelling and researcher coding of answer correctness. Second, better ability to learn odors may provide an advantage to women. Third, reducing positive female learning bias by analyzing consistency in response (regardless of correct odor source identification) fails to assess functional olfactory ability. Functional olfactory ability (naming correct odor source) is significantly better in females, especially in food-rich odor environments.

ConclusionsEnvironment was not a significant factor in olfactory ability in this study but that result may be confounded by methodological biases. We not recommend odor identification as a field tool. Functional olfactory ability exhibits a sex-based pattern but consistency in recognizing the same odor does not. Food-rich odors may enhance olfactory ability in females.

We also tested how the deviant detection signal is affected by the degree of anticipation. We studied regional neural activity when people watched a movie that had varying saliency of a novel or an anticipated flow of salient events. Using intracranial electroencephalography from ten patients, we observed that high-frequency activity (50-150 Hz) in the hippocampus, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dorsolateral PFC), and medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) tracked event saliency.

We dissected neuronal substrates underlying the identified habituation deficits and integrated genotype-phenotype annotations, gene ontologies and interaction networks to determine the clinical features and molecular processes that are associated with habituation deficits.\n\nResultsWe identified more than 100 genes required for habituation learning. For the vast majority of these, 93 genes, a role in habituation learning was previously unknown. These genes characterize ID disorders with overgrowth/macrocephaly and comorbid ASD. Moreover, ASD individuals from the Simons Simplex Collection carrying disruptive de novo mutations in these genes exhibit increased rates of specific aberrant behaviors including stereotypic speech, hyperactivity and irritability. At the molecular level, ID genes required for normal habituation are enriched in synaptic function and converge on Ras-MAPK signaling. Both increased Ras-MAPK signaling in GABAergic and decreased Ras-MAPK signaling in cholinergic neurons specifically inhibit the adaptive habituation response.\n\nConclusionsOur work demonstrates the relevance of habituation learning to autism, identifies an unprecedented number of novel habituation players, supports an emerging role for inhibitory neurons in habituation and reveals an opposing, circuit-level-based mechanism for Ras-MAPK signaling.

CTCF and cohesin proteins located at chromatin interaction anchors and other DNA-binding proteins such as YY1, ZNF143, and SMARCA4 are involved in chromatin interactions. However, there is still no good overall understanding of proteins associated with chromatin interactions and insulator functions.

ResultsHere, I describe a systematic and comprehensive approach for discovering DNA-binding motifs of transcription factors (TFs) that affect EPIs and gene expression. This analysis identified 96 biased orientations [64 forward-reverse (FR) and 52 reverse-forward (RF)] of motifs that significantly affected the expression level of putative transcriptional target genes in monocytes, T cells, HMEC, and NPC and included CTCF, cohesin (RAD21 and SMC3), YY1, and ZNF143; some TFs have more than one motif in databases; thus, the total number is smaller than the sum of FRs and RFs. KLF4, ERG, RFX, RFX2, HIF1, SP1, STAT3, and AP1 were associated with chromatin interactions. Many other TFs were also known to have chromatin-associated functions. The predicted biased orientations of motifs were compared with chromatin interaction data. Correlations in expression level of nearby genes separated by the motif sites were then examined among 53 tissues.

ConclusionOne hundred FR and RF orientations associated with chromatin interactions and functions were discovered.

However, since SpO2 is dependent on ambient atmospheric pressure, the distribution of SpO2 values in populations living above 2000 m a.s.l. is largely unknown. Here, we propose and evaluate a computer model to predict SpO2 values for pediatric permanent residents living between 0 and 4000 m a.s.l. Based on a sensitivity analysis of oxygen transport parameters, we created an altitude-adaptive SpO2 model that takes physiological adaptation of permanent residents into account. From this model, we derived an altitude-adaptive abnormal SpO2 threshold using patient parameters from literature. We compared the obtained model and threshold against a previously proposed threshold derived statistically from data and two empirical datasets independently recorded from Peruvian children living at altitudes up to 4100 m a.s.l. Our model followed the trends of empirical data, with the empirical data having a narrower healthy SpO2 range below 2000 m a.s.l., but the medians did never differ more than 2.29% across all altitudes. Our threshold estimated abnormal SpO2 in only 17 out of 5981 (0.3%) healthy recordings, whereas the statistical threshold returned 95 (1.6%) recordings outside the healthy range. The strength of our parametrised model is that it is rooted in physiology-derived equations and enables customisation. Furthermore, as it provides a reference SpO2, it could assist practitioners in interpreting SpO2 values for diagnosis, prognosis, and oxygen administration at higher altitudes.\n\nNew & NoteworthyOur model describes the altitude-dependent decrease of SpO2 in healthy pediatric residents based on physiological equations and can be adapted based on measureable clinical parameters. The proposed altitude-specific abnormal SpO2 threshold might be more appropriate than rigid guidelines for administering oxygen that currently are only available for sea level patients. We see this as a starting point to discuss and adapt oxygen administration guidelines.",1,14,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/334482v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/334482v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_334482.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The resulting datasets are quite large (with scales of TB/hour in some cases), which has presented a barrier to routine open sharing of this data, slowing progress in reproducible research. State of the art methods for analyzing this data are based on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF); these approaches solve a non-convex optimization problem, and are highly effective when good initializations are available, but can break down e.g. in low-SNR settings where common initialization approaches fail.\n\nHere we introduce an improved approach to compressing and denoising functional imaging data. The method is based on a spatially-localized penalized matrix decomposition (PMD) of the data to separate (low-dimensional) signal from (temporally-uncorrelated) noise. This approach can be applied in parallel on local spatial patches and is therefore highly scalable, does not impose non-negativity constraints or require stringent identifiability assumptions (leading to significantly more robust results compared to NMF), and estimates all parameters directly from the data, so no hand-tuning is required. We have applied the method to a wide range of functional imaging data (including one-photon, two-photon, three-photon, widefield, somatic, axonal, dendritic, calcium, and voltage imaging datasets): in all cases, we observe ~2-4x increases in SNR and compression rates of 20-300x with minimal visible loss of signal, with no adjustment of hyperparameters; this in turn facilitates the process of demixing the observed activity into contributions from individual neurons. We focus on two challenging applications: dendritic calcium imaging data and voltage imaging data in the context of optogenetic stimulation.

However, very few experimental evolutionary studies have convincingly demonstrated the evolution of reproductive isolation due to sexual conflict. Recently a study on replicate populations of Drosophila melanogaster under differential sexual conflict found that divergent mate preference evolved among replicate populations under high sexual conflict regime. The precopulatory isolating mechanism underlying such divergent mate preference could be sexual signals such as cuticular hydrocarbons since they evolve rapidly and are involved in D. melanogaster mate recognition. Using D. melanogaster replicates used in the previous study, we investigate whether cuticular hydrocarbon divergence bears signatures of sexually antagonistic coevolution that led to reproductive isolation among replicates of high sexual conflict regime. We found that D. melanogaster cuticular hydrocarbon profiles are sexually dimorphic. Although replicate populations under high sexual conflict displayed assortative mating, we found no significant differences in the cuticular hydrocarbon profile between the high and low sexual conflict regimes. Instead we find cuticular hydrocarbon divergence patterns to be suggestive of the Buridans Ass regime which is one of the six possible mechanisms to resolve sexual conflict. Sexual selection that co-vary between populations under high and low sexual conflict regimes may also have contributed to the evolution of cuticular hydrocarbons. This study indicates that population differentiation as a result of cuticular hydrocarbon divergence cannot be credited to sexual conflict despite high sexual conflict regime evolving divergent cuticular hydrocarbon profiles.",0,55,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/351718v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/351718v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_351718.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Claims have been made that hyperoxic breathing can help reduce fatigue, increase alertness, and improve attentional capacities; however, few systematic studies of these potential benefits exist. Here we examined the effects of short-term (15 minute) hyperoxia on resting-states in awake human subjects by measuring spontaneous EEG activity between normoxic and hyperoxic situations, using a within-subjects design for both eyes-opened and eyes-closed conditions. We also measured respiration rate, heart rate, and blood oxygen saturation levels to correlate basic physiological changes due to the hyperoxic challenge with any brain activity changes. Our results show that breathing short term 100% oxygen led to increased blood-oxygen saturation levels, decreased heart rate, and a slight, but non-significant, decrease in breathing rate. Changes of brain activity were apparent, including decreases in low-alpha (7-10 Hz), high-alpha (10-14 Hz), beta (14-30 Hz), and gamma (30-50 Hz) frequency ranges during eyes-opened hyperoxic conditions. During eyes-closed hyperoxia, increases in the delta (0.5-3.5 Hz) and theta (3.5-7 Hz) frequency range were apparent together with decreases in the beta range. Hyperoxia appeared to accentuate the decrease of low alpha and gamma ranges across the eyes-opened and closed conditions suggesting that it modulated brain state itself. As decreased alpha during eyes-opened conditions has been associated with increased attentional processing and selective attention, and increased delta and theta during eyes-closed condition are typically associated with the initiation of sleep, our results suggest a state-specific and perhaps opposing influence of short-term hyperoxia.",1,32,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/355941v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/355941v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_355941.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Oscillations in the alpha frequency band are a predominant feature of human brain activity. This oscillation plays a central role in both selective attention and working memory, suggesting that these important cognitive functions are mediated by a unitary mechanism. We show that the alpha oscillation reflects two distinct processes, one that is supported by continuous sampling of the external sensory environment, and one that is based on sampling from internal representations coded in visual short-term memory.

Here, we use complementary unbiased mass spectrometry-based approaches to demonstrate that a single viral protein, Vpr, is both necessary and sufficient to cause the vast majority of these changes. This global protein regulation requires substrate binding and degradation via DCAF1, but is mostly independent of Vpr-mediated cell cycle arrest. Combined approaches of pulsed-Stable Isotope Labelling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture (pulsed-SILAC) and immunoprecipitation-mass spectrometry (IP-MS) identified at least 38 such cellular proteins directly targeted for degradation by Vpr.

We characterize male and female behavioral tuning for all aspects of song, and show that feature tuning is similar between sexes, suggesting sex-shared song detectors drive divergent behaviors. We then identify higher-order neurons in the Drosophila brain, called pC2, that are tuned for multiple temporal aspects of one mode of the males song, and drive sex-specific behaviors.

However, it remains unclear whether top-down signals are integrated at a single locus within the ventral visual pathway (e.g. V4) or at multiple stages (e.g. both V4 and inferotemporal cortex, IT). To investigate, we recorded neural responses in V4 and IT as rhesus monkeys performed a task that required them to identify when a target object appeared across variation in position, size and background context. We found non-visual, task-specific signals in both V4 and IT. To evaluate whether V4 was the only locus for the integration of top-down signals, we evaluated several feed-forward accounts of processing from V4 to IT, including a model in which IT preferentially sampled from the best V4 units and a model that allowed for nonlinear IT computation.

Disease dynamics was recently deciphered and revealed a multiple and progressive infection caused by the Ostreid herpesvirus OsHV-1 {micro}Var, triggering an immunosuppression followed by microbiota destabilization and bacteraemia by opportunistic bacterial pathogens. However, it remains unknown if microbiota might participate to oyster protection to POMS, and if microbiota characteristics might be predictive of oyster mortalities. To tackle this issue, we transferred full-sib progenies of resistant and susceptible oyster families from hatchery to the field during a period in favour of POMS. After five days of transplantation, oysters from each family were either sampled for individual microbiota analyses using 16S rRNA gene-metabarcoding or transferred into facilities to record their survival using controlled condition. As expected, all oysters from susceptible families died, and all oysters from the resistant family survived. Quantification of OsHV-1 and bacteria showed that five days of transplantation was long enough to contaminate oysters by POMS, but not for entering the pathogenesis process. Thus, it was possible to compare microbiota characteristics between resistant and susceptible oyster families at the early steps of infection. Strikingly, we found that microbiota evenness and abundances of Cyanobacteria (Subsection III, family I), Mycoplasmataceae, Rhodobacteraceae, and Rhodospirillaceae were significantly different between resistant and susceptible oyster families.

Therapeutically, antioxidants have failed multiple times. Instead, focusing on only disease-relevant, enzymatic sources of ROS appears to be a more promising and highly validated approach. Here the family of five NADPH oxidases (NOX) stands out as drug targets. Validation has been restricted, however, mainly to genetically modified rodents and is lacking in other species including human. It is thus unclear whether the different NOX isoforms are sufficiently distinct to allow selective pharmacological modulation. Here we show for five of the most advanced NOX inhibitors that indeed isoform selectivity can be achieved. NOX1 was most potently (IC50) targeted by ML171 (0.1 M); NOX2, by VAS2870 (0.7 M); NOX4, by M13 (0.01 M) and NOX5, by ML090 (0.01 M). Conditions need to be carefully controlled though as previously unrecognized non-specific antioxidant and assay artefacts may limit the interpretation of data and this included, surprisingly, one of the most advanced NOX inhibitors, GKT136901. As proof-of-principle that now also pharmacological and non-rodent target validation of different NOX isoforms is possible, we used a human blood-brain barrier model and NOX inhibitor panel at IC50 concentrations. The protective efficacy pattern of this panel confirmed the predominant role of NOX4 in stroke from previous genetic models. Our findings strongly encourage further lead optimization efforts for isoform-selective NOX inhibitors and clinical development and provide an experimental alternative when genetic validation of a NOX isoform is not an option.\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=193 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/382226v2_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1708996org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@15909daorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@960159org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@328083_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG Graphical abstract C_FIG",1,22,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/382226v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/382226v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_382226.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Plant AAADs catalyze either the decarboxylation or decarboxylation-dependent oxidative deamination of aromatic L-amino acids to produce aromatic monoamines or aromatic acetaldehydes, respectively. These compounds serve as key precursors for the biosynthesis of several important classes of plant natural products, including indole alkaloids, benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, hydroxycinnamic acid amides, phenylacetaldehyde-derived floral volatiles, and tyrosol derivatives. Here, we present the crystal structures of four functionally distinct plant AAAD paralogs. Through structural and functional analyses, we identify variable structural features of the substrate-binding pocket that underlie the divergent evolution of substrate selectivity toward indole, phenyl, or hydroxyphenyl amino acids in plant AAADs. Moreover, we describe two mechanistic classes of independently arising mutations in AAAD paralogs leading to the convergent evolution of the derived aldehyde synthase activity. Applying knowledge learned from this study, we successfully engineered a shortened benzylisoquinoline alkaloid pathway to produce (S)-norcoclaurine in yeast. This work highlights the pliability of the AAAD fold that allows change of substrate selectivity and access to alternative catalytic mechanisms with only a few mutations.

SignificancePlants biosynthesize their own proteinogenic aromatic L-amino acids, namely L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine and L-tryptophan, not only for building proteins but also for the production of a plethora of aromatic-amino-acid-derived natural products. Pyridoxal 5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) family enzymes play important roles in channeling various aromatic L-amino acids into diverse downstream specialized metabolic pathways. Through comparative structural analysis of four functionally divergent plant AAAD proteins together with biochemical characterization and molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal the structural and mechanistic basis for the rich divergent and convergent evolutionary development within the plant AAAD family.

For analysis of trajectories we first used mean squared displacement (MSD) analysis. Secondly, we applied an advanced variational Bayesian treatment of hidden Markov models (vbSPT) in combination with the recently introduced packing coefficient (Pc), which together provided a detailed model of three discrete diffusive states, state transitioning and spatial confinement. Interesting to note, state switching between S3 (fast-diffusing) and S1 (slow-diffusing) occurred sequentially over an intermediate state S2. After ligand stimulation more SNAP-tagged {beta}2AR in HEK wild-type cells switched occupancy into the slow-diffusing state, whereas less receptors were found in the fast diffusive state. Unexpectedly, all three states showed a fraction of confined receptor mobility that increased under stimulation, but confinement sizes were unaffected. Receptor diffusion characteristics were comparable in HEK {beta}-arrestin knockout cells under basal conditions and only minor but non-significant changes occurred upon stimulation, as expected from the depletion of {beta}-arrestin, an important regulatory protein.

In contrast, studies of anaesthesia, coma, deep sleep, or some extreme pathological states such as epilepsy, reveal very different cortical activity; all of which states are essentially involuntary, and generally regarded as ""unconscious"". An exception to involuntary disruption of consciousness is Buddhist jh[a]na meditation, whose implicit aim is to intentionally withdraw from the default consciousness, to an inward-directed state of stillness referred to as jh[a]na consciousness, as a basis to develop insight. The default consciousness is sensorily-based, where information about, and our experience of, the outer world is evaluated against personal and organic needs and forms the basis of our ongoing self-experience. This view conforms both to Buddhist models, and to the emerging work on active inference and minimisation of free energy in determining the network balance of the human default consciousness.

This paper is a preliminary report on the first detailed EEG study of jh[a]na meditation, with findings radically different to studies of more familiar, less focused forms of meditation. While remaining highly alert and ""present"" in their subjective experience, a high proportion of subjects display ""spindle"" activity in their EEG, superficially similar to sleep spindles of stage 2 nREM sleep, while more-experienced subjects display high voltage slow-waves reminiscent, but significantly different, to the slow waves of deeper stage 4 nREM sleep, or even high-voltage delta coma. Some others show brief posterior spike-wave bursts, again similar, but with significant differences, to absence epilepsy. Some subjects also develop the ability to consciously evoke clonic seizure-like activity at will, under full control. We suggest that the remarkable nature of these observations reflects a profound disruption of the human DCs when the personal element is progressively withdrawn.",1,35,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/407544v5?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/407544v5.full.pdf,_10.1101_407544.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

It has long been thought that some severe chronic pain conditions, such as Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), are not only associated with, but even maintained by a reorganisation of the somatotopic representation of the affected limb in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). This notion has driven treatments that aim to restore S1 representations, such as sensory discrimination training and mirror therapy. However, this notion is based on both indirect and incomplete evidence obtained with imaging methods with low spatial resolution. Here, we used functional MRI to characterize the S1 representation of the affected and unaffected hand in patients with unilateral CRPS of one hand. Our study demonstrates that the cortical area, location, and geometry of the S1 representation of the CRPS hand are comparable to those of the healthy hand, as well as to those of controls. Given that S1 representations are largely preserved in CPRS patients, it is compelling to reconsider not only the cortical mechanisms that underlie the disorder, but also the rationale for interventions that aim to \""restore\"" somatotopic representations.",1,62,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/409094v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/409094v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_409094.txt,1,general-purpose repository,0,each individual hand map roi is available at <osf link to be disclosed upon acceptance>.,NA

Genes can shift expression as organisms evolve, but how ancestral expression influences altered descendant expression is not well understood. To examine this, we amalgamated 1,903 RNA-seq datasets from 182 research projects, including 6 organs in 21 vertebrate species. Quality control eliminated project-specific biases, and expression shifts were reconstructed using gene-family-wise phylogenetic Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models. Expression shifts following gene duplication result in more drastic changes in expression properties than shifts without gene duplication. The expression properties were tightly coupled with protein evolutionary rate, depending on whether and how gene duplication occurred. Fluxes in expression patterns among organs were nonrandom, forming modular connections which were reshaped by gene duplication. Thus, if expression shifted, ancestral expression in some organs induces a strong propensity for expression in particular organs in descendants.

The former strategy is non-compatible for characterizing properties innate to RNA strands such as secondary structure, RNA-RNA interactions, and also for nanopore direct RNA sequencing involving the sequencing of native RNA strands. The latter strategy, ultracentrifugation, causes loss in genomic information due to its inability to retrieve unassembled viral RNA. We developed a novel nucleic acid manipulation technique involving the capture of whole viral native RNA genomes for downstream RNA assays using hybridization baits in solution to circumvent these problems. This technique involves hybridization of biotinylated baits at 500 nucleotides (nt) intervals, stringent washes and release of free native RNA strands using DNase I treatment, with a turnaround time of about 6 h 15 min. Proof of concept was primarily done using RT-qPCR with dengue virus infected Huh-7 cells. We report that this protocol was able to purify viral RNA (561-791 fold). We also describe a successful application of our capture-based purification method to direct RNA sequencing, with a 77.47% of reads mapping to the target viral genome. We observed a reduction in human host RNA background by 1580 fold, a 99.91% recovery of viral genome with at least 15x coverage, and a mean coverage across the genome of 120x.

Popular frameworks for studying habitat selection include resource-selection functions (RSFs) and step-selection functions (SSFs) estimated using logistic and conditional logistic regression, respectively. Both frameworks compare environmental covariates associated with locations animals visit with environmental covariates at a set of locations assumed available to the animal. Conceptually, random coefficients could be used to accommodate inter-individual heterogeneity with either approach, but straightforward and efficient one-step procedures for fitting SSFs with random coefficients are currently lacking.

2. We take advantage of the fact that the conditional logistic regression model (i. e., the SSF) is likelihood-equivalent to a Poisson model with stratum-specific intercepts. By interpreting the intercepts as a random effect with a large (fixed) variance, inference becomes feasible with standard Bayesian techniques, but also with frequentist methods that allow one to fix the variance of a random effect. We compare this approach to other commonly applied alternatives, including random intercept-only models, and to a two-step algorithm for fitting mixed-effects models.

3. We also reinforce the need to weight available points when fitting RSFs, since models fit using ""infinitely weighted logistic regression"" have been shown to be equivalent to an inhomogeneous Poisson process (IPP). We generalize this result to ""infinitely weighted Poisson regression"", which converges to the same underlying IPP distribution.

4. Using data from Eurasian otters (Lutra lutra) and mountain goats (Oreamnos americanus), we illustrate that our models lead to valid and feasible inference. In addition, we conduct a simulation study to demonstrate the importance of including random slopes when estimating individual- and population-level habitat-selection parameters.

5. By providing coded examples using integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) and Template Model Builder (TMB) for Bayesian and frequentist analysis via the R packages R-INLA and glmmTMB, we hope to make efficient estimation of RSFs and SSFs with random effects accessible to anyone in the field. SSFs with individual-specific coefficients are particularly attractive since they can provide insights into movement and habitat-selection processes at fine-spatial and temporal scales, but these models had previously been very challenging to fit.",1,88,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/411801v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/411801v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_411801.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, the multiplicity of data sources, the diversity of benchmarks, the mixing of observables of different natures, and the necessity of a long-term, systematic approach make such a task challenging. Here we present a first snapshot of a long-term integrative modeling program designed to address this issue: a comprehensive spiking model of cat primary visual cortex satisfying an unprecedented range of anatomical, statistical and functional constraints under a wide range of visual input statistics. In the presence of physiological levels of tonic stochastic bombardment by spontaneous thalamic activity, the modeled cortical reverberations self-generate a sparse asynchronous ongoing activity that quantitatively matches a range of experimentally measured statistics. When integrating feed-forward drive elicited by a high diversity of visual contexts, the simulated network produces a realistic, quantitatively accurate interplay between visually evoked excitatory and inhibitory conductances; contrast-invariant orientation-tuning width; center surround interactions; and stimulus-dependent changes in the precision of the neural code. This integrative model offers numerous insights into how the studied properties interact, contributing to a better understanding of visual cortical dynamics. It provides a basis for future development towards a comprehensive model of low-level perception.

Significance statementComputational modeling can integrate fragments of understanding generated by experimental neuroscience. However, most previous models considered only a few features of neural computation at a time, leading to either poorly constrained models with many parameters, or lack of expressiveness in over-simplified models. A solution is to commit to detailed models, but constrain them with a broad range of anatomical and functional data. This requires a long-term systematic approach.

Recent data have highlighted the genetic diversity of HSV-1 strains, and demonstrated apparent geographic patterns in strain similarity. Though multiple HSV-1 genomes have been sequenced from Europe to date, there is a lack of sequenced genomes from Nordic countries. Finlands history includes at least two major waves of human migration, suggesting the potential for diverse viruses to persist in the population. Here we used HSV-1 clinical isolates from Finland to test the relationship between viral phylogeny, genetic variation, and phenotypic characteristics. We found that Finnish HSV-1 isolates separated into two distinct phylogenetic groups, potentially reflecting historical waves of human (and viral) migration into Finland. Each HSV-1 isolate harbored a distinct set of phenotypes in cell culture, including differences in virus production, extracellular virus release, and cell-type-specific fitness. Importantly, the phylogenetic clusters were not predictive of any detectable pattern in phenotypic differences, demonstrating that whole-genome relatedness is not a proxy for overall viral phenotype. Instead, we highlight specific gene-level differences that may contribute to observed phenotypic differences, and we note that strains from different phylogenetic groups contain the same genetic variations.\n\nImportanceHerpes simplex viruses (HSV) infect a majority of adults.

While significant progress has been made in measuring the activity in the different sub-populations as well as the connectivity between those in experiments, a comprehensive theoretical explanation of how network structure and its dynamics are related is still missing. We suggest a model of layered mouse visual cortex by extending the model suggested by Potjans and Diesmann (2014) with thalamic input that has an orientation bias according to Sadeh et al. (2014). We then studied the response properties of the network to such non-homogeneous input. We found that, without further assumptions, the connectivity derived from experimental data leads to layer-specific distributions of orientation selectivity very similar to what has been observed in mouse experiments. Interestingly, the network settles in a dynamical operating point, in which the efficacy of the different projections and their contribution to orientation tuning deviate strongly from the expectations based on the underlying anatomical connectivity. To understand the processes that shape the observed dynamics, it is essential to perform the analysis of the microcircuit on the system level. With that perspective, we find in particular that the difference in tuning of L2/3 and L4 neurons is an immediate, albeit unexpected consequence of the specific network connectivity. Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for predicting the effects of optogenetic stimulation of specific neuronal sub-populations and demonstrate its power in network simulations.\n\nSignificance StatementUnderstanding the precise roles of neuronal sub-populations in shaping the activity of neuronal networks is a fundamental objective of neuroscience research. To this end, our work makes three important contributions. First, we show that the experimentally extracted connectivity suffices to explain the degree of selectivity of sub-populations in mouse visual cortex to visual stimulation. Second, we introduce a novel system-level approach for the analysis of input-output relations of recurrent networks, which lead to distinct activity patterns.

Here, we study the noisy growth of elastic sheets subject to mechanical feedback. Considering both isotropic and anisotropic growth, we find that the density-density correlation function shows power law scaling. We also consider the dynamics of marked, neutral clones of cells. We find that the areas (but not the shapes) of two clones are always statistically independent, even when they are adjacent. For anisotropic growth, we show that clone size variance scales like the average area squared and that the mode amplitudes characterizing clone shape show a slow 1/n decay, where n is the mode index. This is in stark contrast to the isotropic case, where relative variations in clone size and shape vanish at long times. The high variability in clone statistics observed in anisotropic growth is due to the presence of two soft modes--growth modes that generate no stress.

However, their role in maintenance of OSCC stem cells remains unclear. Here we report that CD44highCD24low population within OSCC cells and primary HNSCC tumors have an elevated expression of miR-146a. Moreover, over-expression of miR-146a results in enhanced stemness phenotype by augmenting CD44highCD24low population. We demonstrate that miR-146a induces stemness by stabilizing {beta}-catenin with concomitant loss of E-cadherin and CD24. Interestingly, CD24 is identified as a novel functional target of miR-146a and ectopic expression of CD24 abrogates miR-146a driven potential CSC phenotype. Mechanistic analysis reveals that higher CD24 levels inhibit AKT phosphorylation leading to {beta}-catenin degradation. Using stably expressing miR-146a/CD24 OSCC cell lines, we also validate that the miR-146a/ CD24/AKT loop significantly alters tumorigenic ability in vivo. Furthermore, we confirmed that {beta}-catenin trans-activates miR-146a, thereby forming a positive feedback loop contributing to stem cell maintenance.

We applied a doxycycline-inducible CRISPRa technology to increase the expression of the potassium channel gene Kcna1 (encoding Kv1.1) in mouse hippocampal excitatory neurons. CRISPRa-mediated Kv1.1 upregulation led to a substantial decrease in neuronal excitability. Continuous video-EEG telemetry showed that AAV9-mediated delivery of CRISPRa, upon doxycycline administration, decreased spontaneous generalized tonic-clonic seizures in a model of temporal lobe epilepsy, and rescued cognitive impairment and transcriptomic alterations associated with chronic epilepsy. The focal treatment minimizes concerns about off-target effects in other organs and brain areas.

Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine spatially selective responses in these areas related to the processing of random-dot stimuli defined by differences in motion. We used population receptive field (pRF) analyses to map retinotopic cortex using bar stimuli comprising coherently moving dots. In the first experiment, we used three separate background conditions: no background dots (dot-defined bar-only), dots moving coherently in the opposite direction to the bar (kinetic boundary) and dots moving incoherently in random directions (global motion). Clear retinotopic maps were obtained for the bar-only and kinetic-boundary conditions across visual areas V1-V3 and in higher dorsal areas. For the global-motion condition, retinotopic maps were much weaker in early areas and became clear only in higher areas, consistent with the emergence of global-motion processing throughout the visual hierarchy. However, in a second experiment we demonstrate that this pattern is not specific to motion-defined stimuli, with very similar results for a transparent-motion stimulus and a bar defined by a static low-level property (dot size) that should have driven responses particularly in V1. We further exclude explanations based on stimulus visibility by demonstrating that the observed differences in pRF properties do not follow the ability of observers to localise or attend to these bar elements. Rather, our findings indicate that dorsal extrastriate retinotopic maps may primarily be determined by the visibility of the neural responses to the bar relative to the background response (i.e. neural signal-to-noise ratios) and suggests that claims about stimulus selectivity from pRF experiments must be interpreted with caution.",1,49,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/435735v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/435735v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_435735.txt,1,general-purpose repository,0,in brief  272  the samsrf matlab toolbox (available at http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1344765) models  273  the prf of each voxel as a 2d gaussian in the visual field incorporating a canonical haemodynamic  274  response function based on the average of 26 participants in a previous study (haas et al. 2014).,NA

Here, we implement a Bayesian method to estimate species divergence times using quantitative characters. Quantitative character evolution is modelled using Brownian diffusion with character correlation and character variation within populations. Through simulations, we demonstrate that ignoring the population variation (or population ""noise"") and the correlation among characters leads to biased estimates of divergence times and rate, especially if the correlation and population noise are high. We apply our new method to the analysis of quantitative characters (cranium landmarks) and molecular data from carnivoran mammals. Our results show that time estimates are affected by whether the correlations and population noise are accounted for or ignored in the analysis. The estimates are also affected by the type of data analysed, with analyses of morphological characters only, molecular data only, or a combination of both; showing noticeable differences among the time estimates. Rate variation of morphological characters among the carnivoran species appears to be very high, with Bayesian model selection indicating that the independent-rates model fits the morphological data better than the autocorrelated-rates model.

Most variants were like wildtype but, unexpectedly, several enhanced mitophagy. A minority destabilized Parkin or severely disrupted Parkin-mediated mitophagy, most of which were also determined as pathogenic based on clinical evidence alone.

Minimal Cut Sets (MCSs) are minimal sets of reactions whose inhibition blocks a target reaction in a metabolic network. Most approaches for finding the MCSs in constrained-based models require, either as an intermediate step or as a byproduct of the calculation, the computation of the set of elementary flux modes (EFMs), a convex basis for the valid flux vectors in the network. Recently, Ballerstein et al. [BvKKH11] proposed a method for computing the MCSs of a network without first computing its EFMs, by creating a dual network whose EFMs are a superset of the MCSs of the original network. However, their dual network is always larger than the original network and depends on the target reaction.

Here we propose the construction of a different dual network, which is typically smaller than the original network and is independent of the target reaction, for the same purpose. We prove the correctness of our approach, MCS2, and describe how it can be modified to compute the few smallest MCSs for a given target reaction.

ResultsWe compare MCS2 to the method of Ballerstein et al. and two other existing methods. We show that MCS2 succeeds in calculating the full set of MCSs in many models where other approaches cannot finish within a reasonable amount of time.

N-myc downstream-regulated gene 2 (NDRG2) has been reported to be a tumor suppressor gene and inhibits colorectal cancer metastasis. However, whether NDRG2 affects colitis initiation and colitis-associated colorectal cancer is unclear. Here, We found that intestine-specific Ndrg2 deficiency caused mild spontaneous colitis with ageing, aggravated DSS and TNBS induced colitis, increased AOM-DSS induced colitis-associated tumor. Ndrg2 loss led to adherens junction (AJ) structure destruction via E-cadherin expression attenuation, resulting in diminished epithelial barrier function and increased intestinal epithelial permeability. Mechanistically, NDRG2 enhancing the interaction of E3 ligase FBXO11 with Snail, the repressor of E-cadherin, to promote Snail degradation by ubiquitination, and maintained E-cadherin expression. In human ulcerative colitis patients, reduced NDRG2 expression is positively correlated with severe inflammation. These findings demonstrate that NDRG2 is an essential colonic epithelial barrier regulator and plays important role in gut homeostasis maintenance and colitis-associated tumor development.

Current models, largely built upon candidate gene based immuno-histochemical and mRNA analyses, suggest that each of the seven hormones synthesized by the pituitary is produced by a specific and exclusive cell lineage. However, emerging evidence suggests more complex models of hormone specificity and cell plasticity. Here we have applied massively parallel single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), in conjunction with a set of orthogonal mRNA and protein imaging studies, to systematically map the cellular composition of adult male and female mouse pituitaries at single-cell resolution and in the setting of major physiologic demands. These analyses reveal sex-specific cellular diversity associated with normal pituitary homeostasis, and identify an array of cells with complex complements of hormone-enrichment as well as a series of non-hormone producing interstitial and supporting cell lineages. These scRNA-seq studies identify a major cell population that is characterized by a unique multi-hormone gene expression profile. The detection of dynamic shifts in cellular representations and transcriptome profiles in response to two well-defined physiologic stresses suggests corresponding roles of a number of these clusters in cellular plasticity within the adult pituitary.

Both high levels of folic acid and low levels of folate can be harmful to health, as low levels of folate have been linked to several diseases while high folic acid supplements can mask a vitamin B12 deficiency. Depressed patients exhibit folate deficiencies, lower levels of hippocampal neurogenesis, elevated levels of homocysteine, and elevated levels of the stress hormone, cortisol, which may be inter-related. Here, we are interested in whether different doses of natural folate or synthetic folic acid diets can influence neurogenesis in the hippocampus, levels of plasma homocysteine, and serum corticosterone in adult female rats. Adult female Sprague-Dawley rats underwent dietary interventions for 29 days. Animals were randomly assigned to six different dietary groups: folate deficient + succinylsulfathiazole (SST), low 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF), low 5-MTHF + (SST), high 5-MTHF + SST, low folic acid, and high folic acid. SST was added to a subset of the 5-MTHF diets to eliminate folic acid production in the gut. Before and after dietary treatment, blood samples were collected for corticosterone and homocysteine analysis, and brain tissue was collected for neurogenesis analysis. High folic acid and low 5-MTHF without SST increased the number of immature neurons (doublecortin-expressing cells) within the ventral hippocampus compared to folate deficient controls. Low 5-MTHF without SST significantly increased the number of immature neurons compared to low and high 5-MTHF + SST, indicating that SST interfered with elevations in neurogenesis. Low folic acid and high 5-MTHF+SST reduced plasma homocysteine levels compared to controls, but there was no significant effect of diet on serum corticosterone levels. Low folic acid and high 5-MTHF+SST reduced the number of mature new neurons in the ventral hippocampus (BrdU/NeuN-positive cells) compared to folate deficient controls. Overall, folic acid dose-dependently influenced neurogenesis, with low levels decreasing but high levels increasing, neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus, suggesting this region, which is important for regulating stress, is particularly sensitive to folic acid in diets. Furthermore, the addition of SST negated the effects of 5-MTHF to increase neurogenesis in the ventral hippocampus.",1,46,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/477448v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/477448v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_477448.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In such settings, a model that maintains a single representation of the category but continuously adapts the learning rate works well.

Here, we engaged non-human primates (macaca mulatta) in an established task that provides a well defined framework to characterize the neuromodulatory effects. In this task, subjects decide whether to look at a right or a left target, guided by one the targets appearing first. Previous studies showed that excitation/inhibition of oculomotor circuits leads to contralateral/ipsilateral biases in this choice behavior. We found that brief, low-intensity ultrasound stimuli (300 ms, 0.6 MPa, 270 kHz) delivered to the animals left/right frontal eye fields bias the animals decisions to the right/left visual hemifield. The effect was modest, about on the order of that produced when injecting moderate amounts of potent neuromodulatory drugs into the same regions in this task. The polarity of the effects suggested a neuronal excitation within the stimulated regions. No effects were observed when we applied the same stimuli to control brain regions not involved in oculomotor target selection. Together, using an established paradigm, we found that transcranial ultrasound is capable of modulating neurons to the extent of biasing choice behavior of non-human primates.

Understanding early transcriptional changes in ASD would assist in clarifying disease pathogenesis and identifying biomarkers and treatments. However, little is known about umbilical cord blood gene expression profiles in babies later diagnosed with ASD compared to non-typically developing (Non-TD) or neurotypical children.\n\nMethodsGenome-wide transcript levels were measured by Affymetrix Human Gene 2.0 array in RNA from umbilical cord blood samples from both the Markers of Autism Risk in Babies--Learning Early Signs (MARBLES) and the Early Autism Risk Longitudinal Investigation (EARLI) high-risk pregnancy cohorts that enroll younger siblings of a child previously diagnosed with ASD. An algorithm-based diagnosis from 36 month assessments categorized the younger sibling as either ASD, typically developing (TD), or not ASD but non-typically developing (Non-TD). 59 ASD, 92 Non-TD, and 120 TD subjects were included and differences were identified in ASD versus TD subjects, with Non-TD versus TD as a specificity control. Meta-analysis was used to combine the results from both studies. Functional enrichments of differentially-expressed genes were examined across diagnostic groups.\n\nResultsWhile cord blood gene expression differences comparing either ASD or Non-TD to TD did not reach genome-wide significance when adjusting for multiple comparisons, 172 genes were nominally differentially-expressed between ASD and TD cord blood (log2(fold change) > 0.1, p < 0.01). These genes were significantly enriched for toxic substance response and xenobiotic metabolism functions, and gene sets involved in chromatin regulation and systemic lupus erythematosus were significantly upregulated (FDR q < 0.05).

This generally causes a low sensitivity in differential expression analysis on protein level. Here, we propose a quantification-first approach for peptides that reverses the classical identification-first workflow. This prevents valuable information from being discarded prematurely in the identification stage and allows us to spend more effort on the identification process. Specifically, we introduce a method, Quandenser, that applies unsupervised clustering on both MS1 and MS2 level to summarize all analytes of interest without assigning identities. Not only does this eliminate the need for redoing the quantification for each new set of search parameters and engines, but it also reduces search time due to the data reduction by MS2 clustering. For a dataset of partially known composition, we could now employ open modification and de novo searches to identify analytes of interest that would have gone unnoticed in traditional pipelines. Moreover, Quandenser reports error rates for feature matching, which we integrated into our probabilistic protein quantification method, Triqler. This propagates error probabilities from feature to protein level and appropriately deals with the noise in quantitative signals caused by false positives and missing values. Quandenser+Triqler outperformed the state-of-the-art method MaxQuant+Perseus, consistently reporting more differentially abundant proteins at 5% FDR: 123 vs. 117 true positives with 2 vs. 25 false positives in a dataset of partially known composition; 62 vs. 3 proteins in a bladder cancer set; 8 vs. 0 proteins in a hepatic fibrosis set; and 872 vs. 661 proteins in a nanoscale type 1 diabetes set.

Little, however, is known about the mechanisms through which parental care variation influences offspring physiology in natural systems. White-throated sparrows Zonotrichia albicollis (WTSPs) exist in two genetic morphs, tan and white, controlled by a large polymorphic supergene. Morphs mate disassortatively, resulting in two pair types: tan male x white female (TxW) pairs, which provide biparental care and white male x tan female (WxT) pairs, which provide female-biased care. To investigate the effects of parental care variation, we performed RNA-seq on WTSP nestlings sampled from nests of both pair types. Pair type had the largest effect on nestling gene expression, with 881 genes differentially expressed (DE) and seven correlated gene co-expression modules. The DE genes and modules up-regulated in nests with female-biased parental care primarily function in metabolism and stress-related pathways resulting from the overrepresentation of stress response and proteolysis genes. These results show that parental genotypes, a proxy for parental care in this system, alter nestling physiology and highlight avenues of further research investigating the ultimate implications of alternative parental care strategies. Nestlings also exhibited morph-specific gene expression, driven by innate immunity genes and co-expression of genes located in the supergene. Remarkably, we identified the same regulatory hub genes in these blood-derived expression networks as were previously identified in WTSP brains (EPM2A, BPNT1, TAF5L). These hub genes were located within the supergene, highlighting the importance of this gene complex in structuring regulatory networks across diverse tissues.",1,63,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/488684v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/488684v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_488684.txt,1,general-purpose repository,1,all files needed to produce these results including code and counts files will be  808  uploaded to this project’s github page: https://github.com/danielnewhouse/wtsp  809  810  811  author contributions djn designed and performed research analyzed the data and wrote the paper.,all files needed to produce these results including code and counts files will be  808  uploaded to this project’s github page: https://github.com/danielnewhouse/wtsp  809  810  811  author contributions djn designed and performed research analyzed the data and wrote the paper.

Mechanistically, we show that transcription of G-CSF (Csf3) gene in myofibers is regulated by MyoD in a metabolism-dependent manner and the myofibers-secreted G-CSF acts as a metabolic niche factor required for establishing and maintaining the Pax7Hi SC subpopulation in adult and physiological aged mice by promoting the asymmetric division of Pax7Hi and Pax7Mi SCs.

Case studies of individual parthenogenetic animals have reported peculiar genomic features which were suggested to be caused by their mode of reproduction, including high heterozygosity, a high abundance of horizontally acquired genes, a low transposable element load, or the presence of palindromes. We systematically characterized these genomic features in published genomes of 26 parthenogenetic animals representing at least 18 independent transitions to asexuality. Surprisingly, not a single feature was systematically replicated across a majority of these transitions, suggesting that previously reported patterns were lineage specific rather than illustrating general consequences of parthenogenesis. We found that only parthenogens of hybrid origin were characterized by high heterozygosity levels. Parthenogens that were not of hybrid origin appeared to be largely homozygous, independently of the cellular mechanism underlying parthenogenesis. Overall, despite the importance of recombination rate variation for the evolution of sexual animal genomes, the genome-wide absence of recombination does not appear to have had the dramatic effects which are expected from classical theoretical models. The reasons for this are probably a combination of lineage-specific patterns, impact of the origin of parthenogenesis, and a survivorship bias of parthenogenetic lineages.",0,22,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/497495v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/497495v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_497495.txt,1,"general-purpose repository, supplement",1,jaron (kamiljaron@gmail.com) data availability: the code of the pipeline for gathering data calculating and plotting results is available at https://github.com/kamilsjaron/genomic-features-of-asexualanimals; the majority of sequencing reads are available in public databases under the accessions listed in supplementary table 1.   supplementary table 2: genomic features calculated from raw data,jaron (kamiljaron@gmail.com) data availability: the code of the pipeline for gathering data calculating and plotting results is available at https://github.com/kamilsjaron/genomic-features-of-asexualanimals; the majority of sequencing reads are available in public databases under the accessions listed in supplementary table 1.;     the pipeline is available at https://github.com/kamilsjaron/genomic-features-of-asexual-animals. jaron (kamiljaron@gmail.com) data availability: the code of the pipeline for gathering data calculating and plotting results is available at https://github.com/kamilsjaron/genomic-features-of-asexualanimals; the majority of sequencing reads are available in public databases under the accessions listed in supplementary table 1.;     the classified repeats tes and other types of classified repeats were estimated using dnapipete. https://github.com/kamilsjaron/genomic-features-of-asexualanimals/blob/master/tables/genome_table_infered_from_reads.tsv  supplementary table 3: genome assemblies: size number of scaffolds n50 busco number of annotated genes.;     supplementary table 4: a complete overview of horizontal gene transfer analysis. https://github.com/kamilsjaron/genomic-features-of-asexualanimals/blob/master/tables/hgt_table.tsv

An especially high rate of false discoveries has been reported in some areas motivating the creation of resource-intensive collaborations to estimate the replication rate of published research by repeating a large number of studies. The substantial amount of resources required by these replication projects limits the number of studies that can be repeated and consequently the generalizability of the findings.\n\nMethods and findingsIn 2013, Jager and Leek developed a method to estimate the empirical false discovery rate from journal abstracts and applied their method to five high profile journals. Here, we use the relative efficiency of Jager and Leeks method to gather p-values from over 30,000 abstracts and to subsequently estimate the false discovery rate for 94 journals over a five-year time span. We model the empirical false discovery rate by journal subject area (cancer or general medicine), impact factor, and Open Access status. We find that the empirical false discovery rate is higher for cancer vs. general medicine journals (p = 5.14E-6). Within cancer journals, we find that this relationship is further modified by journal impact factor where a lower journal impact factor is associated with a higher empirical false discovery rates (p = 0.012, 95% CI: -0.010, -0.001). We find no significant differences, on average, in the false discovery rate for Open Access vs closed access journals (p = 0.256, 95% CI: -0.014, 0.051).\n\nConclusionsWe find evidence of a higher false discovery rate in cancer journals compared to general medicine journals, especially those with a lower journal impact factor. For cancer journals, a lower journal impact factor of one point is associated with a 0.006 increase in the empirical false discovery rate, on average. For a false discovery rate of 0.05, this would result in over a 10% increase to 0.056. Conversely, we find no significant evidence of a higher false discovery rate, on average, for Open Access vs. closed access journals from InCites. Our results provide identify areas of research that may need of additional scrutiny and support to facilitate replicable science.

Ideally, this is achieved using models of the direct relationship with gold standard criterion measures, but the necessary validation data are often unavailable. This study examines an alternative method of harmonisation by indirect validation. Starting methods were self-report or accelerometry, from which we derived indirect models of relationships with doubly labelled water (DLW)-measured physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) using sets of two bridge equations via one of three intermediate measures. Coefficients and performance of indirect models were compared to corresponding direct validation models (linear regression of DLW-measured PAEE on starting methods). Indirect model beta coefficients were attenuated compared to direct model betas (10-63%), narrowing the range of PAEE values; attenuation was greater when bridge equations were weak. Directly and indirectly harmonised models had similar error variance but most indirectly derived values were biased at group-level. Correlations with DLW-measured PAEE were identical after harmonisation using continuous linear but not categorical models. Wrist acceleration harmonised to DLW-measured PAEE via combined accelerometry and heart rate sensing had lowest error variance (24.5%) and non-significant mean bias 0.9 (95%CI: -1.6; 3.4) kJ*day-1*kg-1. Associations between PAEE and BMI were similar for directly and indirectly harmonised values, but most fell outside the confidence interval of the criterion PAEE-to-BMI association. Indirect models can be used for harmonisation.

EVs carry protein, lipids, and nucleic acids within the circulation, to target cells whereupon they mediate physiological changes. Due to their small size, quantification and characterization by conventional microscopy is not possible. However, nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) has provided a method to determine the fluid concentration and size of extracellular vesicles and other nanoparticles. While NTA provides statistical summaries of samples in an experiment, a recurring difficulty is the organization, manipulation, and management of raw particle count data because of the large size of datasets, and resultant vulnerability to user error. To address these limitations, we developed tidyNano, an R package that provides functions to import, clean, and quickly summarize raw NanoSight (Malvern Panalytical) data for efficient calculation of statistics and visualization. Here, we provide a framework for importing raw nanoparticle data and provide functions to facilitate rapid and efficient analysis, visualization and calculation of summary statistics. tidyNano was used to analyze murine plasma extracellular vesicles across gestation by aggregating and summarizing samples based on technical, biological and gestational parameters. In addition, we developed shinySIGHT, a Shiny web application that allows for interactive exploration and visualization of EV data. Using this package, we analyzed data generated from 36 samples of EV derived from the plasma of mice across gestation.\n\nPeripheral EV concentration increased linearly across pregnancy, with trending increases as early as gestation day (GD) 5.5 and significant rises at GD14.5, and 17.5 relative to EV concentrations in nonpregnant females. Thus, the data highlight the utility of the mouse as a model of EV biology in pregnancy. Further, the package provides a mechanism for seamless analysis of EV data generated by NanoSight.

Moreover, MAGICAL promoted conventional confocal microscopy to visualize finer neuronal structures including synaptic boutons and spines in unprecedented deep regions, without intensive illumination leading to phototoxic effects.

The FinDonor 10 000 study was set up to study iron status and factors affecting iron stores in Finnish blood donors. In Finland, iron supplementation for at-risk groups has been in place since the 1980s.

Material and Methods2584 blood donors (N= 8003 samples) were recruited into the study alongside the standard donation at three donation sites in the capital region of Finland between 5/2015 and 12/2017. All participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire about their health and lifestyle. Blood samples were collected from the sample pouch of whole blood collection set, kept in cool temperature and processed centrally. Whole blood count, CRP, ferritin and sTFR were measured from the samples and DNA was isolated for GWAS studies.

ResultsParticipant demographics, albeit in general similar to the general blood donor population in Finland, indicated some bias toward older and more frequent donors. Participation in the study increased median donation frequency of the donors. Analysis of the effect of time lag from the sampling to the analysis and the time of day when sample was drawn revealed small but significant time-dependent changes.

ConclusionThe FinDonor cohort now provides us with tools to identify potential donor groups at increased risk of iron deficiency as factors explaining this risk. The increase in donation frequency during the study suggests that scientific projects can be used to increase the commitment of blood donors.",1,44,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/507665v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/507665v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_507665.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

While the many different representations of biodiversity can lead to a more complete description of communities, they also lead to a degree of  fragmentation of the biodiversity concept. Developing a unified measure that integrates all the dimensions of biodiversity is a theoretical solution for this problem, however, it remains an operationally utopian task. Alternatively, quantifying the dimensionality of biodiversity is a way to integrate the different dimensions of biological diversity. This concept is explored in the present study. We define the dimensionality of diversity as the number of different diversity metrics needed to effectively describe biodiversity. We provide a solution that joins the two components of dimensionality (correlation and the variation of each diversity metric) in the same framework, allowing us to quantify dimensionality. We show, through a simulation study, that considering the correlation among dimensions with the variation of each dimension offers important information that is neglected when only correlation information (the component used in the current methodology to measure dimensionality) is considered. We demonstrate how to apply the proposed framework by investigating the dimensionality of South American small mammal communities (cricetids and marsupials). Our example demonstrates that the taxonomic dimension of diversity captures most of the spatial variation among these communities.

We proposed that signaling-level responses after PI would reveal new mechanisms of action that could be therapeutically exploited. Unbiased phosphoproteomics after the PI carfilzomib surprisingly demonstrated the most prominent phosphorylation changes on splicing related proteins. Spliceosome modulation was invisible to RNA or protein abundance alone. Transcriptome analysis after PI demonstrated broad-scale intron retention, suggestive of spliceosome interference, as well as specific alternative splicing of protein homeostasis machinery components. These findings led us to evaluate direct spliceosome inhibition in myeloma, which synergized with carfilzomib and showed potent anti-tumor activity. Functional genomics and exome sequencing further supported the spliceosome as a specific vulnerability in myeloma. Our results propose splicing interference as an unrecognized modality of PI mechanism, reveal additional modes of spliceosome modulation, and suggest spliceosome targeting as a promising therapeutic strategy in myeloma.

An example is the moderately psychedelic state caused by low doses of ketamine. Therefore, we investigated whether and how measures of evoked and spontaneous electroencephalographic (EEG) signal diversity are altered by sub-anaesthetic levels of ketamine compared to normal wakefulness, and how these measures relate to subjective assessments of consciousness.\n\nMethodsHigh-density electroencephalography (EEG, 62 channels) was used to record spontaneous brain activity and responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 10 healthy volunteers before and after administration of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine in an open-label within-subject design. Evoked signal diversity was assessed using the perturbational complexity index (PCI), calculated from the global EEG responses to local TMS perturbations. Signal diversity of spontaneous EEG, with eyes open and eyes closed, was assessed by Lempel Ziv complexity (LZc), amplitude coalition entropy (ACE), and synchrony coalition entropy (SCE).\n\nResultsAlthough no significant difference was found in the index of TMS-evoked complexity (PCI) between the sub-anaesthetic ketamine condition and normal wakefulness, all the three measures of spontaneous EEG signal diversity showed significantly increased values in the sub-anaesthetic ketamine condition. This increase in signal diversity also correlated with subjective assessment of altered states of consciousness. Moreover, spontaneous signal diversity was significantly higher when participants had eyes open compared to eyes closed, both during normal wakefulness and during influence of sub-anaesthetic ketamine doses.\n\nConclusionThe results suggest that PCI and spontaneous signal diversity may be complementary and potentially measure different aspects of consciousness. Thus, our results seem compatible with PCI being indicative of the brains ability to sustain consciousness, as indicated by previous research, while it is possible that spontaneous EEG signal diversity may be indicative of the complexity of conscious content. The observed sensitivity of the latter measures to visual input seems to support such an interpretation. Thus, sub-anaesthetic ketamine may increase the complexity of both the conscious content (experience) and the brain activity underlying it, while the level, degree, or general capacity of consciousness remains largely unaffected.",1,56,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/508697v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/508697v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_508697.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Many circular RNAs are stable and contain exons, but are not translated into proteins. Circular RNA has important functions in gene regulation and plays an important role in some human diseases. Several biological methods, such as RNase R treatment, have been developed to identify circular RNA. Multiple bioinformatics tools have also been developed for circular RNA detection with high-throughput sequence data. In this paper, we present circDBG, a new method for circular RNA detection with de Bruijn graph. We conduct various experiments to evaluate the performance of CircDBG based on both simulated and real data. Our results show that CircDBG finds more reliable cir-cRNAs with low bias, has more efficiency in running time, and performs better in balancing accuracy and sensitivity than existing methods. As a byproduct, we also introduce a new method to classify circular RNAs based on reads alignment. Finally, we report a potential chimeric circular RNA that is found by CircDBG based on real sequence data.

We use the McDonald and Kreitman (MK) test to separate the influences of positive and negative selection.

However, dense plant populations may aggravate the abortion rate of young grains and result in fewer number of kernels per ear. Grain filling rate and duration play a decisive role in maize grain yield. Therefore, increasing plant density, consideration of enhancing the grain filling rate and duration of individual maize plant and regulating crop senescence would be the first priority. In this study, we examined the regulatory effects of GA4+7 under two application methods (shank-smearing and silk-smearing). Shank-soaking with GA4+7 at the rate of 0 (CK1), 10 (T1), 60 (T2), and 120 (T3) mg L-1, while silk-smearing at the rate of 0 (CK2), 10 (S1), 60 (S2), and 120 (S3) mg L-1 were used. The results showed that GA4+7 improved the grain filling rate by increasing the content of auxin, gibberellin and zeatin and abscisic acid in grains compared to control plants. In addition, The auxin, gibberellin and zeatin contents in the grains were positively and significantly correlated with the maximum grain weight and the maximum and mean grain-filling rates; the abscisic acid level was positively correlated with the maximum grain weight and the maximum and mean grain-filling rates. Moreover, GA4+7 increased the activities of superoxide dismutases, catalases, peroxidases, and reduced the malondialdehyde content in leaves compared with untreated plants. At the rate of 60 mg L-1, GA4+7 showed the greatest effect for shank-smearing and silk-smearing (T2 and S2), followed by 10 mg L-1 (T1) for shank-smearing and 120 mg L-1 (S3) for silk-smearing.

While expression levels of several cell surface and secreted proteins were unchanged, their exocytosis was increased. Rtn4a depletion reduced cell surface trafficking without affecting ER morphology, and increasing the tubule-to-sheet ratio by other means did not affect trafficking. These data suggest that Rtn4a enhances exocytosis independently of changes in ER morphology. We demonstrate that Rtn4a enhances ER-to-Golgi trafficking and co-localizes with COPII vesicles.

We sought to specifically diagnose such bottlenecks by interactively visualizing data from all levels of bottom-up LC-MS/MS analysis. Many search engines, such as MaxQuant, already provide such data, and we developed an open source platform for their interactive visualization and analysis: Data-driven Optimization of MS (DO-MS). We found that in many cases DO-MS not only specifically diagnosed bottlenecks but also enabled us to rationally optimize them.

The current study investigated mechanisms contributing to within-host evolution of FMDV in a natural host species (cattle). Specifically, vaccinated and non-vaccinated cattle were infected with FMDV under controlled, experimental conditions and subsequently sampled for up to 35 days to monitor viral genomic changes as related to phases of disease and experimental cohorts. Consensus-level genomic changes across the entire FMDV coding region were characterized through three previously defined stages of infection: early, transitional, and persistent. The overall conclusion was that viral evolution occurred via a combination of two mechanisms: emergence of full-genomic minority haplotypes from within the inoculum super-swarm, and concurrent continuous point mutations. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that individuals were infected with multiple distinct haplogroups that were pre-existent within the ancestral inoculum used to infect all animals.

To address these questions, we established a simple system for simultaneously inflicting precise laser wounds and imaging at high spatial and temporal resolution. We show that in C. elegans, wounding provokes a rapid sealing of the plasma membrane, involving reorganisation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5- bisphosphate domains. This is followed by a radial recruitment at the wound site of EBP-2/EB1, a protein that binds the plus ends of microtubules. EB1 recruitment is accompanied by a reorganisation of microtubules, required for the subsequent recruitment of actin and wound closure. It is also required for the directed trafficking towards the site of injury of the key signalling protein SNF-12. In the absence of SNF-12 recruitment, there is an abrogation of the immune response.

As the quality of the error correction has huge impacts on downstream processes, developing methods allowing to evaluate error correction tools with precise and reliable statistics is therefore a crucial need. Since error correction is often a resource bottleneck in long reads pipelines, a key feature of assessment methods is therefore to be efficient, in order to allow the fast comparison of different tools.

ResultsWe propose ELECTOR, a reliable and efficient tool to evaluate long reads correction, that enables the evaluation of hybrid and self-correction methods. Our tool provides a complete and relevant set of metrics to assess the read quality improvement after correction and scales to large datasets. ELECTOR is directly compatible with a wide range of state-of-the-art error correction tools, using whether simulated or real long reads. We show that ELECTOR displays a wider range of metrics than the state-of-the-art tool, LRCstats, and additionally importantly decreases the runtime needed for assessment on all the studied datasets.

It is known that different mitochondrial matrix proteins undergo mitophagy with very different rates, but to date the mechanism underlying this selectivity at the individual protein level has remained obscure. We now present evidence indicating that protein phosphorylation within the mitochondrial matrix plays a mechanistic role in regulating selective mitophagic degradation in yeast, via involvement of the Aup1 mitochondrial protein phosphatase, as well as two known matrix-localized protein kinases, Pkp1 and Pkp2. By focusing on a specific matrix phosphoprotein reporter, we also demonstrate that phospho-mimetic and non-phosphorylatable point mutations at known phosphosites in the reporter increased or decreased its tendency to undergo mitophagy. Finally, we show that phosphorylation of the reporter protein is dynamically regulated during mitophagy, in an Aup1-dependent manner. Our results indicate that structural determinants on a mitochondrial matrix protein can govern its mitophagic fate, and that protein phosphorylation regulates these determinants.\n\nSignificance statementMitochondrial dysfunction underlies many age-related human pathologies. In normal cells, defective mitochondria are often degraded by mitophagy, a process in which these mitochondria are engulfed in autophagosomes and sent for degradation in the lysosome/vacuole. Surprisingly, studies on mitophagy in diverse eukaryotic organisms reveal an unexpected dimension of protein-level selectivity, wherein individual protein species exhibit divergent rates of mitophagic degradation. In this manuscript, we show that this surprising intra-mitochondrial selectivity can be generated by differential phosphorylation of individual mitochondrial protein species, and we identify mitochondrial phosphatases and kinases which contribute to this regulation. By identifying a mechanism which regulates the intra-mitochondrial selectivity of mitophagic degradation, our findings open the door to potential manipulation of the quality control process in the future.",1,47,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513135v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/513135v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_513135.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

From postnatal days (PD) 4-9, a period of brain development equivalent to the third trimester, Sprague-Dawley rats received EtOH (5.25g/kg/day) or sham intubation, as well as CP (0.4 mg/kg/day) or vehicle. All subjects were tested on open field activity (PD 18-21), spatial learning (PD 40-46), and elevated plus maze (PD 30) tasks. Both EtOH and CP increased locomotor activity in the open field, and the combination produced more severe overactivity than either exposure alone. Similarly, increases in thigmotaxis in the Morris water maze were caused by either EtOH or CP alone, and were more severe with combined exposure, although only EtOH impaired spatial learning. Finally, developmental CP, but not EtOH, increased time spent in the open arms on the elevated plus maze. Overall, these data indicate that EtOH and CP produce some independent domain-specific effects, but many effects of EtOH and CP on behavior were additive.

Animal models have demonstrated the importance of spatial context representations within the hippocampal formation in contextualization of fear learning. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) is known to play an important role in safety learning, possibly also through the incorporation of context information. However, if contextual representations are related to context-dependent expression of fear memory in humans remains unclear. Twenty-one healthy participants underwent functional MRI combined with a cue-context conditioning paradigm within a self-navigated virtual reality environment. The environment included two buildings (Threat and Safe context), which had distinct features outside but were identical inside. Within each context, participants saw two cues (CS+, CS-). The CS+ was consistently (100% reinforcement rate) paired with an electric shock in the Threat context, but never in the Safe context. The CS- was never paired with a shock. We found robust differential skin conductance responses (SCRs; CS+ > CS-) in the Threat context, but also within the Safe context, indicating fear generalization. Within the Safe context, vmPFC responses to the CS+ were larger than those in the Threat context. We furthermore found environment-specific representantions for the two contexts in the training paradigm (i.e., before conditioning took place) in the hippocampus to be related to fear expression and generalization. Namely, participants with a weak context representation (z-score < 1.65) showed stronger fear generalization compared to participants with a strong context representation (z-score > 1.65). Thus, a low neural representation of spatial context may explain overgeneralization of memory to safe contexts. In addition, our findings demonstrate that context-dependent regulation of fear expression engages ventromedial prefrontal pathways suggesting this involves a similar mechanism that is known to be involved in retrieval of extinction memory.",1,352,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/514505v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/514505v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_514505.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here we demonstrate a completely different mechanism which occurs without cell wedging. In mammalian salivary glands and teeth, we show that initial invagination occurs through coordinated vertical cell movement. Specifically, we show that cells towards the periphery of the placode move vertically upwards while their more central neighbours move downwards to create the invagination. We further show that this occurs by active cell-on-cell migration: outer cells migrate with an apical leading edge protrusion, depressing the central cells to \""telescope\"" the epithelium downwards into the underlaying mesenchyme. Cells remain basally attached to the underlying lamina while their apical protrusions are dynamic and planar polarised centripetally. These protrusions depend on the actin cytoskeleton, and inhibition of the branching molecule Arp2/3 inhibits them and the invagination.

By employing its two heads (motor domains), cytoplasmic dynein shows various bipedal stepping motions; the inchworm and hand-over-hand motions, as well as non-alternate steps of one head. However, the molecular basis to achieve such diverse stepping manners remains obscure. Here, we propose a kinetic model for bipedal motions of cytoplasmic dynein and performed Gillespie Monte Carlo simulations that reproduces most experimental data obtained to date. The model represents status of each motor domain as five states according to conformations, nucleotide- and MT-binding conditions of the domain. Also, the relative positions of the two domains were approximated by three discrete states. Accompanied by ATP hydrolysis cycles, the model dynein stochastically and processively moved forward in multiple steps via diverse pathways, including inchworm and hand-over-hand motions, same as experimental data. The model reproduced key experimental motility-related parameters including velocity and run-length as functions of ATP concentration and external force. Our model reveals that, in a typical inchworm motion, the leading domain moves via the ATP-dependent power-stroke of the linker coupled with a small change in the stalk angle, whereas the lagging domain moves via diffusion dragged by the leading domain. Moreover, the hand-over-hand motion in the model dynein clearly differs from that of kinesin by the usage of the power-stroke.\n\nAuthor SummaryCytoplasmic dynein is a two-headed molecular motor, which moves linearly and transports intra-cellar organelles along microtubules driven by ATP hydrolysis free energy. In contrast to other better-known molecular motors, such as kinesin, dynein is known to take various stepping motions including motions akin to human walking and inchworm-like motions. However, molecular mechanisms underpinning the diverse stepping motions are unclear. Here, based on recent high-resolution structure information and single-molecule motility assay data, we designed a kinetic model that explicitly include two heads, each of which makes ATP hydrolysis cycles and moves along the microtubules. Using the model, we performed Monte Carlo simulations. The simulation reproduced most of currently available experimental results. More importantly, the simulation suggested molecular mechanisms of various stepping motions. While stepping motions apparently resemble to those proposed before, once looking into details, we found the resulting mechanisms distinct from previously proposed ones in the usage of ATP and protein conformation changes coupled with stepping motions.",0,315,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/516179v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/516179v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_516179.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Network embedding approaches analyze these complicated networks by representing genes as low-dimensional vectors based on the network topology. These low-dimensional vectors have recently become the building blocks for a larger number of systems biology applications. Despite the success of embedding genes in this way, it remains unclear how to effectively represent gene sets, such as protein complexes and signaling pathways. The direct adaptation of existing gene embedding approaches to gene sets cannot model the diverse functions of genes in a set. Here, we propose GRep, a novel gene set embedding approach, which represents each gene set as a multivariate Gaussian distribution rather than a single point in the low-dimensional space. The diversity of genes in a set, or the uncertainty of their contribution to a particular function, is modeled by the covariance matrix of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. By doing so, GRep produces a highly informative and compact gene set representation. Using our representation, we analyze two major pharmacogenomics studies and observe substantial improvement in drug target identification from expression-derived gene sets. Overall, the GRep framework provides a novel representation of gene sets that can be used as input features to off-the-shelf machine learning classifiers for gene set analysis.",0,634,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/519033v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/519033v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_519033.txt,0,NA,1,NA,the grep software package is available at ​https://github.com/wangshenguiuc/grep​ .

Observers performed a perpetual grouping task in which they reported whether a grid of identical tilted bars (45{degrees} counterclockwise from the vertical) is perceived as rows or columns. Performance was measured multiple times during a testing session to determine the effects of repeated exposure to the stimuli. To test for possible effects of learning on the within-session dynamics, observers repeated the experiment on five different days. We found that repeated performance produced rapid within-day improvements, which were largely transient, and were not retained when tested on subsequent days. In addition, exposure to stimuli with equal orientation contributed to the within-session improvement, whereas stimuli having an orientation differing by 45{degrees} from the orientation used in the grouping task diminished the improvement previously obtained in the same session. Practice with the task, over days, resulted in faster improvements. The transient nature of these exposure-driven improvements and their susceptibility to interference by stimuli designed to reduce adaptation suggests that adaptation was the main cause for the observed improvements. Finally, to investigate the effects of adaptation on internal noise and on spatial integration, we employed an external noise paradigm, showing that internal noise reduction resulted from adaptation. Internal noise was reduced only when spatial integration was effective, suggesting that adaptation improved perception of global stimulus properties. Overall, our results suggest that the grouping task benefits from an adaptation process that rapidly adjusts the visual system to the statistics of the visual stimuli. We suggest that this effect is achieved through spatial decorrelation of neural responses. With practice, the visual system is able to adjust faster to changes in the statistics of the environment.",1,67,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/519561v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/519561v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_519561.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Computational prioritization approaches aim to support target selection by ranking candidate targets in the context of a given disease. We propose a novel target prioritization approach, GuiltyTargets, which relies on deep network representation learning of a genome-wide protein-protein interaction network annotated with disease-specific differential gene expression and uses positive-unlabeled machine learning for candidate ranking. We evaluated our approach on six diseases of different types (cancer, metabolic, neurodegenerative) within a 10 times repeated 5-fold stratified cross-validation and achieved AUROC values between 0.92 - 0.94, significantly outperforming a previous approach, which relies on manually engineered topological features. Moreover, we showed that GuiltyTargets allows for target repositioning across related disease areas. Applying GuiltyTargets to Alzheimers disease resulted into a number of highly ranked candidates that are currently discussed as targets in the literature. Interestingly, one (COMT) is also the target of an approved drug (Tolcapone) for Parkinsons disease, highlighting the potential for target repositioning of our method.\n\nAvailabilityThe GuiltyTargets Python package is available on PyPI and all code used for analysis can be found under the MIT License at https://github.com/GuiltyTargets.\n\nAuthor summaryMany drug candidates fail in clinical trials due to low efficacy. One of the reasons is the choice of the wrong target protein, i.e. perturbation of the protein does not effectively modulate the disease phenotype on a molecular level. In consequence many patients do not demonstrate a clear response to the drug candidate. Traditionally, targets are selected based on evidence from the literature and follow-up experiments. However, this process is very labor intensive and often biased by subjective choices. Computational tools could help a more rational and unbiased choice of target proteins and thus increase the chance of drug discovery programs. In this work we propose a novel machine learning based method for target candidate ranking. The method (GuiltyTargets) captures properties of known targets to learn a ranking of candidates.

We tested whether the sight of a distressed conspecific elicited fear in zebrafish, and whether this was modulated by familiarity.

The behaviour of individual fish was then recorded in paired tanks within sight of either a familiar or an unfamiliar individual, before and after distilled water or an alarm substance was added to the demonstrator, but not to the observer. As expected, addition of distilled water did not elicit any behavioural change in either the demonstrator or the observer. However, addition of an alarm cue triggered anti-predatory behaviours in the demonstrator which caused the expression of anti-predatory behaviours in the observer, suggesting the existence of fear contagion. Furthermore, the extent of fear contagion was affected by familiarity, and observers were more active, swam closer to the bottom and further away from the demonstrator when they watched a distressed familiar neighbour than when they watched an unfamiliar fish. Our results have implications for fish welfare because they show that fish can become stressed by simply watching others become stressed.

Whereas most human studies are limited to correlational conclusions, rodent studies can prospectively investigate how ELA alters cognitive performance in a number of domains. Despite the vast volume of reports, no consensus has yet been reached on the i) behavioral domains being affected by ELA and ii) the extent of these effects.\n\nMethodsTo test how ELA (here: aberrant maternal care) affects specific behavioral domains, we used a 3-level mixed-effect meta-analysis, a flexible model that accounts for the dependency of observations. We thoroughly explored heterogeneity with MetaForest, a machine-learning data-driven analysis never applied before in preclinical literature. We validated the robustness of our findings with substantial sensitivity analyses and bias assessments.\n\nResultsOur results, based on >400 independent experiments, yielded >700 comparisons, involving ~8600 animals. Especially in males, ELA promotes memory formation during stressful learning but impairs non-stressful learning. Furthermore, ELA increases anxiety and decreases social behavior.

Furthermore, the question of whether removal of pro-inflammatory mediators from the perfusate might offer additional benefits in optimising kidneys prior to transplantation has not been addressed. Using pairs of human kidneys obtained from the same donor, we compared the effect of NMP with that of cold storage on the global transcriptome of kidneys, and then went on to investigate the impact of adding a haemoadsorption device to the NMP circuit. We found that cold storage significantly reduced the expression of inflammatory genes, but also of genes required for energy generation such as those encoding oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) enzymes. In contrast, during NMP, there was marked upregulation OXPHOS genes, as well as a number of immune and inflammatory pathway genes. The induction of inflammatory genes during NMP was substantially attenuated by the addition of a haemoadsorber to the perfusion circuit, which also further increased OXPHOS pathway gene expression.

The efficiency of CRISPR/LbCpf1-based HDR was significantly modulated by physical culture conditions such as temperature and light. Ten days of incubation at 31{degrees}C under a light/dark cycle after Agrobacterium-mediated transformation resulted in the best performance among the tested conditions.

In response to dynamic changes in TE content, host genomes are proposed to alter the piRNAs that they produce in order to silence the most active TE families. Surprisingly, however, piRNA pathway proteins, which execute piRNA biogenesis and enforce silencing of targeted sequences, also evolve rapidly and adaptively in animals. If TE silencing evolves through changes in piRNAs, what necessitates changes in piRNA pathway proteins? Here we used interspecific complementation to test for functional differences between Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans alleles of three adaptively evolving piRNA pathway proteins: Armitage, Aubergine and Spindle-E. Surprisingly, we observed interspecific divergence in the regulation of only a handful of TE families, which were more robustly silenced by the heterospecific piRNA pathway protein. This suggests that positive selection does not act on piRNA effector proteins to enhance their function in TE repression, but rather that TEs may evolve to ""escape"" silencing by homospecific alleles. We also discovered that D. simulans alleles of aub and armi exhibit enhanced off-target effects on host transcripts in a D. melanogaster background, suggesting the avoidance of genomic auto-immunity as a critical target of selection. Our observations suggest that piRNA effector proteins are subject to an evolutionary trade-off between defending the host genome from the harmful effect of TEs while also minimizing friendly fire against host genes.

Author SummaryTransposable elements are mobile fragments of selfish DNA that burden host genomes with deleterious mutations and incite genome instability. Host cells employ a specialized small-RNA mediated silencing pathway, the piRNA pathway, to act as a genomic immune system suppressing the mobilization of TEs. Changes in genomic TE content are met with rapid changes in the piRNA pool, thereby maintain host control over transposition. However, piRNA pathway proteins--which enact piRNA biogenesis and silence target TEs--also evolve adaptively. To isolate forces that underlie this adaptive evolution, we examined functional divergence between two Drosophila species for three adaptively evolving piRNA pathway proteins. To our surprise, we found very few differences in TE regulation, suggesting that evolution has not generally acted to enhance control of TE parasites. Rather, we discovered interspecific differences in the regulation of host mRNAs for two proteins, which suggested that proteins evolve to avoid off-target silencing of host transcripts. We propose that the avoidance of such ""genomic autoimmunity"" is an important and underappreciated force driving the adaptive evolution of piRNA proteins.",1,76,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/521773v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/521773v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_521773.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

EphA2 functions as a cellular receptor for the gH/gL glycoprotein complex of KSHV for several adherent cell types. KSHV gH/gL was previously shown to also weakly interact with other members of the Eph family of receptors. Whether these interactions are of functional consequence remained unclear so far, even if other A-type Ephs were shown to be able to compensate for absence of EphA2 in overexpression systems. Here, we demonstrate for the first time that endogenously expressed EphA7 in BJAB B cells is critical for the cell-to-cell transmission of KSHV from producer iSLK cells to BJAB target cells. The BJAB lymphoblastoid cell line often serves as a model for B cell infection and expresses only low levels of all Eph family receptors other than EphA7. Endogenous EphA7 could be precipitated from the cellular lysate of BJAB cells using recombinant gH/gL, and knockout of EphA7 significantly reduced transmission of KSHV into BJAB target cells by over 80%. Finally, we demonstrate that receptor function of EphA7 is conserved between cell-to-cell transmission of KSHV and cell-free infection by the related rhesus monkey rhadinovirus (RRV), which is relatively even more dependent on EphA7 for infection of BJAB cells.\n\nIMPORTANCEInfection of B cells is biologically relevant for two KSHV-associated malignancies, the plasmablastic variant of multicentric Castlemans disease (MCD) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). Elucidating the process of B cell infection is therefore important to understand the pathogenesis of these diseases. For various types of adherent cells, EphA2 has been shown by several groups to function as an entry receptor that is engaged by the gH/gL glycoprotein complex. Our previous findings indicate that KSHV does not only interact with EphA2, but can also bind to other members of the Eph family of receptor tyrosine kinases with comparatively lower avidity. We now analyzed the requirement of Eph interactions for infection of the BJAB B cell line, a model for infection of B cells by KSHV. We identify EphA7 as the principal Eph receptor for infection of this model B cell line by both KSHV and the related rhesus monkey rhadinovirus.",1,359,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/522243v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/522243v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_522243.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Mab is intrinsically resistant to several classes of antibiotics and an increasing number of strains isolated from patients exhibit resistance to most antibiotics considered for treatment of Mab infections.

Synthesis of the essential cell wall peptidoglycan in Mab is achieved via two enzyme classes, L,D- and D-D-transpeptidases, with each class preferentially inhibited by different subclasses of {beta}-lactam antibiotics. We hypothesized that a combination of two {beta}-lactams that comprehensively inhibit the two enzyme classes will exhibit synergy in killing Mab. Paired combinations of antibiotics tested for in vitro synergy against Mab included dual {beta}-lactams, a {beta}-lactam and a {beta}-lactamase inhibitor, and a {beta}-lactam and a rifamycin. Of the initial 206 combinations screened, 24 pairs exhibited synergy. 13/24 pairs were combinations of two {beta}-lactams. 12/24 pairs brought the minimum inhibitory concentrations of both drugs to within the therapeutic range.

We observed DAM enrichment associated with neuronal loss and the degree of amyloid deposits, which was commonly found in different brain regions. The neuronal subtype analyses showed that DAM enrichment was correlated with the proportion of two excitatory neurons located in the cortical layer 4.

Recent work supports that mechanical membrane disruption or perturbation to NPC assembly can trigger an ESCRT-dependent surveillance system that seals nuclear envelope pores: how these pores are sensed and sealed remains to be fully defined. Here, we show that the principal components of the nuclear envelope surveillance system in yeast, which includes the ESCRT Chm7 and the integral inner nuclear membrane (INM) protein Heh1, are spatially segregated by the nuclear transport system. Specifically, at steady state Chm7 is actively restricted from the nucleus by Crm1/Xpo1. Consistent with the idea that it is the exposure of the INM that triggers surveillance, the expression of a transmembrane anchor and the winged helix domain of Heh1 is sufficient to recruit and activate Chm7 at a membrane interface. Correlative light electron tomography under conditions of Chm7 hyper-activation further show the formation of an elaborate network of fenestrated sheets at the INM and suggest ER-membrane delivery at sites of nuclear envelope herniation. Our data point to a model in which exposure of Chm7 to Heh1, driven by any perturbation in the nuclear envelope barrier would lead to local nuclear envelope remodeling to promote membrane sealing.

SWI/SNF complexes remodel nucleosomes to regulate gene expression and play a key role in organogenesis. Here we reported a unique function of BAF250a in regulating the physical interaction of OCT4 and {beta}-CATENIN during cardiac lineage differentiation from human ESCs. BAF250a deletion greatly reduced the physical interaction between OCT4 and {beta}-CATENIN but did not alter the expression of {beta}-CATENIN and OCT4 in the mesodermal progenitor cells. BAF250a ablation led to decreased recruitment of OCT4 and {beta}-CATENIN at promoters of key mesodermal lineage genes, such as MESP1 and EOMES. Subsequently, the expression of lineage specific genes was down-regulated whereas the expression of pluripotent genes was up-regulated. In parallel, BAF250a ablation also altered recruitments of OCT4 and {beta}-CATENIN to the promoter of CCND2 and CCND3, two key genes for S phase entry during cell cycle. Consequently, BAF250a deletion led to prolonged S phase in Mesp1+ cardiac progenitor cells, which in turn inhibited efficient differentiation of Mesp1+ to Isl1+ cells. Furthermore, BAF250a deletion abolished the interaction of OCT4 and BRG1 in mesoderm, suggesting that BAF250a is the key component in SWI/SNF complex that determines the interaction of Oct4/{beta}-catenin in mesoderm. In contrast, we found that BAF250a did not regulate the OCT4/{beta}-CATENIN interaction during neuroectoderm differentiation.

This process promotes the rapid spread of genetic information across lineages, typically in the form of clusters of genes referred to as genomic islands (GIs). Different types of GIs exist, often classified by the content of their cargo genes or their means of integration and mobility. Various computational methods have been devised to detect different types of GIs, but no single method currently is capable of detecting all GIs.

ResultsWe propose a method, which we call Shutter Island, that uses a deep learning model (Inception V3, widely used in computer vision) to detect genomic islands. The intrinsic value of deep learning methods lies in their ability to generalize. Via a technique called transfer learning, the model is pre-trained on a large generic dataset and then re-trained on images that we generate to represent genomic fragments. We demonstrate that this image-based approach generalizes better than the existing tools.

ConclusionsWe used a deep neural network and an image-based approach to detect the most out of the correct GI predictions made by other tools, in addition to making novel GI predictions. The fact that the deep neural network was retrained on only a limited number of GI datasets and then successfully generalized indicates that this approach could be applied to other problems in the field where data is still lacking or hard to curate.",1,89,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/525030v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/525030v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_525030.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The virus-host interactions regulating HCMV metabolic hijacking are essential to infection. While multiple host factors including kinases and transcription factors have been defined, little is known about the viral factors required. Some host factors involved are dependent on Ca2+ signaling or host stress response. The viral pUL37x1 protein mobilizes Ca2+ and targets the mitochondria. The Ca2+ changes induced by pUL37x1 can activate stress responses. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the viral pUL37x1 protein is required for HCMV metabolic remodeling. Using a combination of metabolomics, lipidomics, and metabolic tracers, we demonstrate that pUL37x1 protein is necessary for HCMV induced fatty acid elongation and lipid metabolism but not required for most viral hijacking of central carbon metabolism. Additionally, we show that pUL37x1 is required for HCMV to fully induce two host proteins that were previously demonstrated to be important for virus induced lipid metabolism: fatty acid elongase 7 and the ER-stress related kinase PERK. We also demonstrate, for the first time, that HCMV replication results in the increase in phospholipids with very-long chain fatty acyl tails. We conclude that pUL37x1 is required for HCMV metabolic remodeling but is not necessary to for the virus to hijack metabolism on a network-wide scale.",1,717,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/526228v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/526228v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_526228.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

When listening to melodies, most humans encode the relations between pitches into memory using an ability called relative pitch (RP). A small subpopulation, almost exclusively musicians, preferentially encode pitches using absolute pitch (AP): the ability to identify the pitch of a sound without an external reference. In this study, we recruited a large sample of musicians with AP (AP musicians) and without AP (RP musicians). The participants performed a pitch-processing task with a Listening and a Labeling condition during functional magnetic resonance imaging. General linear model analysis revealed that while labeling tones, AP musicians showed lower blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal in the inferior frontal gyrus and the presupplementary motor area -- brain regions associated with working memory, language functions, and auditory imagery. At the same time, AP musicians labeled tones more accurately suggesting that AP might be an example of neural efficiency. In addition, using multivariate pattern analysis, we found that BOLD signal patterns in the inferior frontal gyrus and the presupplementary motor area differentiated between the groups. These clusters were similar, but not identical compared to the general linear model-based clusters. Therefore, information about AP and RP might be present on different spatial scales. While listening to tones, AP musicians showed increased BOLD signal in the right planum temporale which may reflect the matching of pitch information with internal templates and corroborates the importance of the planum temporale in AP processing.",1,147,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/526541v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/526541v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_526541.txt,1,general-purpose repository,0,all stimuli and the  150  stimulus presentation scripts are available online on the open science framework (https://osf.io/ybghd/).,NA

This process occurs through the action of molecular motors, cytoskeletal networks and the nucleus. How the combined activity of these different components is spatiotemporally regulated to ensure efficient spindle assembly remains unclear. Here we show that during prophase the centrosomes-nucleus axis reorients, so that centrosomes are positioned on the shortest nuclear axis at nuclear envelope (NE) breakdown. This centrosomes-nucleus configuration depends on mechanical cues generated by mitotic chromosome condensation on the prophase nucleus. We further show these mechanosensitive cues act through SUN1/2 and NudE+NudEL to enable the polarized loading of Dynein on the NE. Finally, we observe this centrosome configuration favors the establishment of an initial bipolar spindle scaffold, facilitating chromosome capture and accurate segregation, without compromising division plane orientation. We propose that chromosome segregation fidelity depends on the mechanical properties of the prophase nucleus that facilitate spindle assembly by regulating NE-Dynein localization.",0,33,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/526939v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/526939v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_526939.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

To provide a novel interpretation of the evolution of primate brains, sulcal morphological variability of the medial frontal cortex was assessed in old-world monkeys (macaque, baboon) and Hominoidea (chimpanzee, human). We discovered that both Hominoidea do possess a paracingulate sulcus, which was previously thought to be uniquely human and linked to higher cognitive functions like mentalizing. Also, we revealed systematic sulcal morphological organisations of the medial frontal cortex that can be traced from multiple old-world monkey to Hominoidea species, demonstrating an evolutionary conserved organizational principle.

Network topology studies may reveal patterns associated to specific organisms. Here we propose a new methodology to denoise PPI networks and predict missing links solely based on the network topology, the Organization Measurement (OM) method. The OM methodology was applied in the denoising of the PPI networks of two Saccharomyces Cerevisiae datasets (Yeast and CS2007) and one Homo Sapiens dataset (Human). To evaluate the denoising capabilities of OM methodology, two strategies were applied. The first compared its application in random networks and in the reference set networks, while the second perturbed the networks with the gradual random addition and removal of edges. The application of OM methodology to the Yeast and Human reference sets achieved an AUC of 0.95 and 0.87, in Yeast and Human networks, respectively. The random removal of 80% of the Yeast and Human reference sets interactions resulted in an AUC of 0.71 and 0.62, whereas the random addition of 80% interactions resulted in an AUC of 0.75 and 0.72, respectively. Applying the OM methodology to the CS2007 dataset yields an AUC of 0.99. We also perturbed the network of the CS2007 dataset by randomly inserting and removing edges in the same proportions previously described. The false positives identified and removed from the network varied from 97%, when inserting 20% more edges, to 89% when 80% more edges were inserted. The true positives identified and inserted in the network varied from 95% when removing 20% of the edges, to 40% after the random deletion 80% edges. The OM methodology is sensitive to the topological structure of the biological networks. The obtained results suggest that the present approach can efficiently be used to denoise PPI networks.",1,44,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/527606v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/527606v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_527606.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here, we demonstrate a de novo approach to identify mobile elements from short-read sequencing data. The method identifies the precise site of mobile element insertion and infers the identity of the inserted sequence. This is an improvement over previous methods that either rely on curated databases of known mobile elements or rely on  split-read alignments that assume the inserted element exists within the reference genome. We apply our approach to 12,419 sequenced isolates of nine prevalent bacterial pathogens, and we identify hundreds of known and novel mobile genetic elements, including many candidate insertion sequences. We find that the mobile element repertoire and insertion rate vary considerably across species, and that many of the identified mobile elements are biased toward certain target sequences, several of them being highly specific. Mobile element insertion hotspots often cluster near genes involved in mechanisms of antibiotic resistance, and such insertions are associated with antibiotic resistance in laboratory experiments and clinical isolates. Finally, we demonstrate that mutagenesis caused by these mobile elements contributes to antibiotic resistance in a genome-wide association study of mobile element insertions in pathogenic Escherichia coli. In summary, by applying a de novo approach to precisely identify mobile genetic elements and their insertion sites, we thoroughly characterize the mobile element repertoire and insertion spectrum of nine pathogenic bacterial species and find that mobile element insertions play a significant role in the evolution of clinically relevant phenotypes, such as antibiotic resistance.",1,415,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/527788v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/527788v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_527788.txt,0,NA,1,NA,604  methods  605  code availability  606  the  mustache  command-line  tool  is  available  for  download  607  https://github.com/durrantmm/mustache.

This revealed the presence of 27 viral species, of which 24 were novel, including double-stranded RNA viruses (Picobirnaviridae and Reoviridae), single-stranded RNA viruses (Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae), a retro-transcribing DNA virus (Hepadnaviridae), and a single-stranded DNA virus (Parvoviridae). These viruses comprise multi-host generalist viruses and those that are host-specific, indicative of both virome connectivity and heterogeneity. Virome connectivity was apparent in two well described multi-host virus species (avian coronavirus and influenza A virus) and a novel Rotavirus species that were shared among some Anseriform species, while heterogeneity was reflected in the absence of viruses shared between Anseriformes and Charadriiformes. Notably, within avian host families there was no significant relationship between either host taxonomy or foraging ecology and virome composition, although Anseriform species positive for influenza A virus harboured more additional viruses than those negative for influenza virus.

Here we investigate the m6A topology during early vertebrate embryogenesis and its association with polyadenylated mRNA levels. The majority (>70%) of maternal transcripts harbor m6A, and there is a substantial increase of m6A in the polyadenylated mRNA fraction between 0 and 2 hours post fertilization. Notably, we find strong associations between m6A, cytoplasmic polyadenylation and translational efficiency prior to zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Interestingly, the relationship between m6A and translation is strongest for peaks located in the 3UTR, but not overlapping stop codons. Sequence analyses revealed enrichment of motifs for RNA binding proteins involved in translational regulation and RNA degradation. After ZGA, m6A seem to diminish the effect of miR-430 mediated degradation.

In tropical forests, a large percentage of seeds is dispersed by animals, and their foraging behaviour and movement patterns determine SDD. Direct observations of seed dispersal events by animals in natural plant populations are mostly constrained by the high mobility and low visibility of their vectors. Therefore, diverse alternative methods are used to estimate SDD, but direct comparisons of these approaches within the same seed dispersal system are mostly missing.
C_LIO_LIIn this study, we take advantage of two plant species with different life history traits, Leonia cymosa and Parkia panurensis that are exclusively dispersed by two tamarin species, Saguinus mystax and Leontocebus nigrifrons (Callitrichidae) at our study site in the Peruvian Amazon. We compare SDD estimates obtained from direct observations, genetic identification of mother plants from seed coats, parentage analysis of seedlings, and modelling approaches, including the combination of movement data and gut passage times and individual-based modelling.
C_LIO_LIWe detect differences between SDD estimates that can be linked to the processes relevant at different phases of the seed dispersal loop covered by the respective approaches. Despite these differences, SDD estimates for P. panurensis are consistently lower than for L. cymosa which is likely related to differences in fruit characteristics and fruit abundance, factors that influence gut passage time, foraging behaviour and movement patterns of the tamarins.

Recently, we presented a general theory showing common electrophysiological traits in different CP rat models, i.e. a collapse of relevant functional connectivity network properties, such as modularity, in the somatosensory thalamo-cortical (TC) network. In this work, we preliminary investigated by an in silico accurate simulator of the six-layer mammalian cortical networks that evidenced the crucial collapse of network modularity in CP simulated conditions and the consequent reduction of network adaptive processes. On this track, in studies on CP experimental animals affected by sciatic nerve multiple ligature (Bennett-Xie model), by synchrotron-generated X-ray microbeam (MB) irradiations (7 parallel beams, 100um width), we targeted in vivo the CP involved hindlimb somatosensory projection cortex that, because of the doses radiation (360 Gy, peak at each beam), non-invasively produced fast and precise tissue destruction along the 7 beam projections. These parcellated the cortical tissue and restored the cortical network statistics related to modularity and information processing efficiency as evidenced from post irradiation in vivo electrophysiological recordings. In addition, by MB treatment there was an ensuing removal of behavioral signs of allodynia and hyperalgesia accompanied by recovered normal gait schemes yet preserving the normal sensory thresholds of the experimental rats up to three months after the MB irradiation. Finally, novel and unprecedented therapeutic appraisals for CP are devised.

Significance StatementChronic pain (CP) is an excruciating condition with severe effects on patients life. Apart from many clinical and experimental studies no current theory on CP is generally accepted. Recently, we proposed a general theory of CP in experimental animals as characterized by strong alteration of the connections among neurons in different brain regions. We show here on in silico simulations that specific connectivity changes in the somatosensory cortex recover the lost functional integrity. Concurrently, in experimental animals, we re-modulated, in vivo, some anatomical connections of the somatosensory cortex by extremely thin synchrotron generated X-ray microbeam irradiations. The resulting behavioral and electrophysiological signs of CP disappeared yet maintaining normal sensory responses. No adverse or pathological effects on blank animals were observable.",0,429,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/528539v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/528539v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_528539.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Efforts to link these clinical differences to specific molecular features have focused on somatic mutations within the coding regions of the genome. Here, we describe the first pan-cancer analysis of sex differences in whole genomes of 1,983 tumours of 28 subtypes from the ICGC Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes project. We both confirm the results of exome studies, and also uncover previously undescribed sex differences. These include sex-biases in coding and non-coding cancer drivers, mutation prevalence and strikingly, in mutational signatures related to underlying mutational processes. These results underline the pervasiveness of molecular sex differences and strengthen the call for increased consideration of sex in cancer research.

Sex disparities in cancer epidemiology include an increased overall cancer risk in males corresponding with higher incidence in most tumor types, even after adjusting for known risk factors1,2. Cancer mortality is also higher in males, due in part to better survival for female patients in many cancer types, including those of the colon and head & neck3. Interestingly, female colorectal cancer patients respond better to surgery4 and adjuvant chemotherapy, though this is partially due to biases in tumour location and microsatellite instability5. Similarly, premenopausal female nasopharyngeal cancer patients have improved survival regardless of tumour stage, radiation or chemotherapy regimen6. There is a growing body of evidence for sex differences in cancer genomics7-13, but their molecular origins and clinical implications remain largely elusive.

Previous studies have mostly focused on protein coding regions, leaving the vast majority of the genome unexplored. We hypothesized that there are uncharacterized sex differences in the non-coding regions of the genome. Using whole genome sequencing data from the Pan-cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) project14, we performed a survey of sex-biased mutations in 1,983 samples (1,213 male, 770 female) from 28 tumour subtypes, excluding those of the sex organs (Supplementary Table 1). We also excluded the X and Y chromosomes to focus on autosomal sex differences in cancers affecting both men and women, but there are known to be significant X-chromosome mutational differences between tumours arising in men and women15. Our analysis revealed sex differences in both genome-wide phenomena and in specific genes. These sex-biases occur not only at the pan-cancer level across all 1,983 samples, but also in individual tumour subtypes.",1,311,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/528968v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/528968v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_528968.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, interactions are captured only for the labeled subset of molecules, which tends to be a small fraction. As a result, it has remained a challenge to calculate molecular interaction kinetics, in particular association rates, from single-molecule tracking data. To overcome this challenge, we developed a mathematical modeling-based Framework for the Inference of in Situ Interaction Kinetics from single-molecule imaging data (termed ""FISIK""). FISIK consists of (1) devising a mathematical model of molecular movement and interactions, mimicking the biological system and data-acquisition setup, and (2) estimating the unknown model parameters, including molecular association and dissociation rates, by fitting the model to experimental single-molecule data. Due to the stochastic nature of the model and data, we adapted the method of indirect inference for model calibration. We validated FISIK using a series of tests, where we simulated trajectories of diffusing molecules that interact with each other, considering a wide range of model parameters, and including resolution limitations and tracking errors. We found that FISIK has the sensitivity to determine association and dissociation rates, where its accuracy depends on the labeled fraction of molecules and the extent of molecule tracking errors. For cases where the labeled fraction is relatively low (e.g. to afford accurate tracking), combining dynamic but sparse single-molecule imaging data with almost whole-population oligomer distribution data improves FISIKs performance. All in all, FISIK is a promising approach for the derivation of molecular interaction kinetics in their native environment from single-molecule imaging data.",1,93,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/530063v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/530063v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_530063.txt,0,NA,1,NA,software availability fisik code to perform all of the procedures and analyses described in this work is available on github (https://github.com/kjaqaman/fisik).

Minor deleterious effects of high-pass filtering in traditional time-series analysis have been well-documented, including temporal displacements. However, its effects on time-resolved multivariate pattern classification analyses (MVPA) are largely unknown.

New MethodTo prevent potential displacement effects, we extend an alternative method of removing slow drift noise - robust detrending - with a procedure in which we mask out all cortical events from each trial. We refer to this method as trial-masked robust detrending.

ResultsIn both real and simulated EEG data of a working memory experiment, we show that both high-pass filtering and standard robust detrending create artifacts that result in the displacement of multivariate patterns into activity silent periods, particularly apparent in temporal generalization analyses, and especially in combination with baseline correction. We show that trial-masked robust detrending is free from such displacements.

Comparison with Existing Method(s)Temporal displacement may emerge even with modest filter cut-off settings such as 0.05 Hz, and even in regular robust detrending. However, trial-masked robust detrending results in artifact-free decoding without displacements. Baseline correction may unwittingly obfuscate spurious decoding effects and displace them to the rest of the trial.

ConclusionsDecoding analyses benefits from trial-masked robust detrending, without the unwanted side effects introduced by filtering or regular robust detrending. However, for sufficiently clean data sets and sufficiently strong signals, no filtering or detrending at all may work adequately.

Long read sequencing greatly assists with resolving complex bacterial genomes, particularly when combined with short-read Illumina data (hybrid assembly). However, it is not clear how different long-read sequencing methods impact on assembly accuracy. Relative automation of the assembly process is also crucial to facilitating high-throughput complete bacterial genome reconstruction, avoiding multiple bespoke filtering and data manipulation steps. In this study, we compared hybrid assemblies for 20 bacterial isolates, including two reference strains, using Illumina sequencing and long reads from either Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) or from SMRT Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) sequencing platforms. We chose isolates from the Enterobacteriaceae family, as these frequently have highly plastic, repetitive genetic structures and complete genome reconstruction for these species is relevant for a precise understanding of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance. We de novo assembled genomes using the hybrid assembler Unicycler and compared different read processing strategies. Both strategies facilitate high-quality genome reconstruction. Combining ONT and Illumina reads fully resolved most genomes without additional manual steps, and at a lower consumables cost per isolate in our setting. Automated hybrid assembly is a powerful tool for complete and accurate bacterial genome assembly.

IMPACT STATEMENTIllumina short-read sequencing is frequently used for tasks in bacterial genomics, such as assessing which species are present within samples, checking if specific genes of interest are present within individual isolates, and reconstructing the evolutionary relationships between strains. However, while short-read sequencing can reveal significant detail about the genomic content of bacterial isolates, it is often insufficient for assessing genomic structure: how different genes are arranged within genomes, and particularly which genes are on plasmids - potentially highly mobile components of the genome frequently carrying antimicrobial resistance elements. This is because Illumina short reads are typically too short to span repetitive structures in the genome, making it impossible to accurately reconstruct these repetitive regions. One solution is to complement Illumina short reads with long reads generated with SMRT Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) or Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) sequencing platforms. Using this approach, called  hybrid assembly, we show that we can automatically fully reconstruct complex bacterial genomes of Enterobacteriaceae isolates in the majority of cases (best-performing method: 17/20 isolates). In particular, by comparing different methods we find that using the assembler Unicycler with Illumina and ONT reads represents a low-cost, high-quality approach for reconstructing bacterial genomes using publicly available software.

A causal direction between the affective traits and asthma is difficult to determine, however, it may be that there is a common underlying pathway attributable to shared genetic factors. Our aim was to determine whether a common genetic susceptibility exists for asthma and each of the affective traits.

An adult twin cohort from the Swedish Twin Register underwent questionnaire-based health assessments (n=23 693) and genotyping (n=15 908). Firstly, questionnaire-based associations between asthma and affective traits were explored. This was followed by genetic analyses: a) polygenic risk scores (PRS) for affective traits were used as predictors of asthma, and b) linkage-disequilibrium score regression based on genome-wide association results from UK Biobank was used to quantify genetic correlations.

Analyses found that the questionnaire-based associations between asthma and each affective trait were associated (OR 1.7, 95%CI 1.5-1.9 major depression, OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.3-1.6 anxiety, and OR 1.6, 95% 1.4-1.8 high neuroticism). Genetic susceptibility for neuroticism explained the variance in asthma with a dose response effect; that is, those in the highest neuroticism PRS quartile were more likely to have asthma than those in the lowest quartile (OR 1.4, 95%CI 1.2-1.6). Genetic correlations were found between depression and asthma (rg= 0.17), but not for anxiety or neuroticism score.

We conclude that the observed comorbidity between asthma and the affective traits may in part be due to shared genetic influences between asthma and depression and neuroticism, but not anxiety.",1,614,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/530865v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/530865v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_530865.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Recent evidence suggests that integrating additional omics can improve the prediction accuracy which raises the question of how to integrate the additional omics. Regardless of the integration strategy, clinical utility and translatability are crucial. Thus, we reasoned a multi-omics approach combined with clinical datasets would improve drug response prediction and clinical relevance.

ResultsWe propose MOLI, a Multi-Omics Late Integration method based on deep neural networks. MOLI takes somatic mutation, copy number aberration, and gene expression data as input, and integrates them for drug response prediction. MOLI uses type-specific encoding subnetworks to learn features for each omics type, concatenates them into one representation and optimizes this representation via a combined cost function consisting of a triplet loss and a binary cross-entropy loss. The former makes the representations of responder samples more similar to each and different from the non-responders, and the latter makes this representation predictive of the response values. We validate MOLI on in vitro and in vivo datasets for five chemotherapy agents and two targeted therapeutics. Compared to state-of-the-art single-omics and early integration multi-omics methods, MOLI achieves higher prediction accuracy in external validations. Moreover, a significant improvement in MOLIs performance is observed for targeted drugs when training on a pan-drug input, i.e. using all the drugs with the same target compared to training only on drug-specific inputs. MOLIs high predictive power suggests it may have utility in precision oncology.

This system is conserved in related bacteria, including the sister genus Brevundimonas. Previous studies had shown unexpected phenotypic differences between the C. crescentus divK mutant and the analogous mutant of Brevundimonas subvibrioides, but further characterization was not performed. Here, phenotypic assays analyzing motility, adhesion, and pilus production (the latter characterized by a newly discovered bacteriophage) revealed that divJ and pleC mutants have mostly similar phenotypes as their C. crescentus homologs, but divK mutants maintain largely opposite phenotypes than expected. Suppressor mutations of the B. subvibrioides divK motility defect were involved in cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) signaling, including the diguanylate cyclase dgcB, and cleD which is hypothesized to affect flagellar function in a c-di-GMP dependent fashion. However, the screen did not identify the diguanylate cyclase pleD. Disruption of pleD in B. subvibrioides caused hypermotility in wild-type, but not in the divK background. Analysis of c-di-GMP levels in these strains revealed incongruities between c-di-GMP levels and displayed phenotypes with a notable result that suppressor mutations altered phenotypes but had little impact on c-di-GMP levels in the divK background. Conversely, when c-di-GMP levels were artificially manipulated, alterations of c-di-GMP levels in the divK strain had minimal impact on phenotypes. These results suggest that DivK performs a critical function in the integration of c-di-GMP signaling into the B. subvibrioides cell cycle.

ImportanceCyclic-di-GMP signaling is one of the most broadly conserved signaling systems in bacteria, but there is little understanding of how this system directly affects the physiology of the organism. In C. crescentus, c-di-GMP has been integrated into the developmental cell cycle, but there is increasing evidence that environmental factors can impact this system as well. The research presented here suggests that developmental signaling could impact physiological Processes in c-di-GMP dependent and independent ways. This hints that the integration of these signaling networks could be more complex than previously hypothesized, which could have a bearing on the larger field of c-di-GMP signaling.

In this study, we present a pipeline integrating modelling and experimental approaches to understand metabolic interactions between organisms in a community. We define a new index named Metabolic Support Index (MSI), which quantifies the benefits derived by each organism in the presence of the other when grown as a co-culture. We computed MSI for several experimentally demonstrated co-culture systems and showed that MSI, as a metric, accurately identifies the organism that derives the maximum benefit. We also computed MSI for a commonly used yeast co-culture consisting of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia stipitis and observed that the latter derives higher benefit from the interaction. Further, we designed two-stage experiments to study mutual interactions and showed that P. stipitis indeed derives the maximum benefit from the interaction, as shown from our computational predictions. Also, using our previously developed computational tool MetQuest, we identified all the metabolic exchanges happening between these organisms by analysing the pathways spanning the two organisms. By analysing the HPLC profiles and studying the isotope labelling, we show that P. stipitis consumes the ethanol produced by S. cerevisiae when grown on glucose-rich medium under aerobic conditions, as also indicated by our in silico pathway analyses.

Often situated in coastal beach ridges or sand dunes, sites exhibit horizontal and vertical disturbances, while datable materials such as wood charcoal are typically highly degraded, or derived from old trees or drift wood and bone collagen rarely survives in the tropical conditions. Shell, therefore, is the most logical material for dating Pacific sites since it is resistant to alteration, can be sampled to ensure only the last few seasons of growth are represented and is often closely tied to human economic activities. However, shell radiocarbon (14C) dating has been plagued by interpretive problems largely due to our limited knowledge of the 14C cycle in near shore marine and estuarine environments. Consequently, shell dates are typically ignored in regional chronometric evaluations and often avoided for dating altogether. Recent advances in our understanding of the source of shell 14C content as well as the development of the first South Pacific Gyre model of changing marine 14C over time, combined with Bayesian statistical modelling, have now provided us with insight into the value of these shell radiocarbon dates, enabling a revision of the age of the Toaga site on Ofu Island, an early occupation site associated with the initial Polynesian Plainware period in Samoa, the earliest use of which is now dated to between 2782 and 2667 cal BP.",1,725,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/532648v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/532648v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_532648.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

One of the main barriers to adherence is the long distance between patient residences and healthcare facilities. We designed an intervention, Mobile Antiretroviral Therapy and HIV care (MAP-HC) in rural southwestern Uganda aimed to reduce travel distance and hypothesized that MAP-HC would improve ART adherence and rates of viral load suppression.

MethodsThe study was conducted at two sites, Kitagata and Itojo Hospitals, and these are public health facilities located in rural southwestern Uganda. Patients who lived >5km from the hospital were provided the option to participate. For each hospital, we identified 4 health centres in the catchment area to serve as site for the mobile pharmacy. Each site was visited once a month to provide ART refills, adherence counseling and treatment of other illnesses. We measured patient waiting time, adherence and viral load suppression before and after the intervention.

ResultsWe conducted baseline assessment among 292 patients at the two hospitals. The mean waiting time at Kitagata Hospital changed from 4.48 hours before the intervention but increased to 4.76 hours after the intervention (p=0.13). The proportion of patients who missed an ART dose in the last 30 days dropped from 20% at baseline to 8.5% at 12 months after the intervention (p=0.009). The proportion of patients with detectable viral load from 19.9% to 7.4% after the intervention (p=0.001).

ConclusionsOur study has showed that a mobile pharmacy intervention in rural Uganda is feasible and resulted in improvement in adherence and viral load suppression. Although it did not reduce patient waiting time at the clinic, we recommend a scale-up of this intervention in rural areas where patients face challenges of transportation to the clinic.",1,794,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/533950v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/533950v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_533950.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Revisiting this idea, recent neuroscientific theories have proposed that emotions experienced in dreams contribute to the resolution of emotional distress (e.g. fear extinction) and preparation for future waking affective reactions. Here we addressed one emerging common prediction from these theoretical accounts, namely that experiencing fear in dreams is associated with more adapted responses to threatening signals during wakefulness. Using a stepwise approach across two studies, we first identified brain regions activated when experiencing fear in dreams and then showed that frightening dreams modulated the response of these same regions to threatening stimuli during wakefulness. As predicted, more fear in dreams was associated with reduced activation of those fear-responsive regions during wakefulness. Specifically, in Study 1, we performed serial awakenings in 18 participants recorded throughout the night with high-density EEG and asked them whether they experienced any fear in their dreams. Insula activity increased (i.e. decreased delta and increased gamma power) for dreams containing fear. In Study 2, we tested 89 participants and found that those with higher incidence of fear in their dreams showed reduced fMRI response to fear-eliciting stimuli in the insula, amygdala and midcingulate cortex, while awake. Consistent with better emotion regulation processes, the same participants also displayed increased medial prefrontal cortex activity. These findings support that emotions in dreams and wakefulness engage similar neural substrates, and substantiate a link between emotional processes occurring during sleep and emotional brain functions during wakefulness.",1,99,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/534099v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/534099v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_534099.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

To circumvent these limitations, we developed a spatial memory task that required minimal human intervention, allowed simultaneous and unsupervised testing of several mice, and yielded a high number of recall trials per session (up to ~20). Moreover, because recall sessions could be repeated over many days, the task provided enough statistical power to characterize in detail the animals behavior during memory recall, even to quantify the decay in spatial accuracy of memories as they are stacked across days. In addition, the task is compatible with neural activity recordings.

Selective expression of Shh by motor neurons of the lateral motor column at the beginning of oligodendrogenesis ensures a more yielding pMN domain at limb levels compared to thoracic levels.

This inversion, which drastically displaces the ori site, changes the relative length of the replication arms so that one replichore is approximately 0.41 Mb while the other is about 1.40 Mb in length. Genomic reversion to the original chromosome constellation is not observed in PCR-monitored analyses after 180 generations of growth in rich medium. As compared to the parental strain, the inversion surprisingly demonstrates a nearly identical growth pattern in exponential phase. Similarly, when cultured separately in rich medium during prolong stationary phase or in an experimental acute infection animal model (Galleria mellonella), the survival rate of both the parental strain and the invertant is equivalent. However, when co-incubated together, both in vitro and in vivo, the survival of the invertant declines relative to the parental strain. The accompanying aspect of the study suggests that inversions taking place nearby oriC, always happen to secure the linkage of oriC to DNA sequences responsible for chromosome partition. The biological relevance of large scale inversions is also discussed.

IMPORTANCEBased on our previous work, we created to our knowledge the largest asymmetric inversion covering 43.5% of the S. pyogenes genome. In spite of a drastic replacement of origin of replication and the unbalanced size of replichores (1.4 Mb vs 0.41 Mb), the invertant, when not challenged with its progenitor, showed impressive vitality for growth in vitro and pathogenesis assays. The mutant supports the existing idea that slightly deleterious mutations can provide the setting for secondary adaptive changes. Furthermore, comparative analysis of the mutant with previously published data strongly indicate that even large genomic rearrangements survive provided that the integrity of the oriC and the chromosome partition cluster is preserved.",1,364,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/534933v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/534933v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_534933.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In Arabidopsis thaliana the establishment of reproductive growth can be divided into two phases: In the first phase, cauline leaves with axillary meristems are formed and internode elongation begins. In the second phase, lateral meristems develop into flowers with defined organs. Floral shoots are usually determinate and suppress the development of lateral shoots. Here, we describe a Ds transposon insertion mutant in the Nossen (No-0) accession with severe defects in floral development and flower morphology. The most striking aspect is the outgrowth of stems from the axillary bracts of the primary flower carrying terminal secondary flowers. Therefore, we named this mutant flower-in-flower (fif). However, the insertion of the transposon in the annotated gene is not responsible for the fif phenotype. By means of classical and genome sequencing-based mapping, the mutation responsible for the fif phenotype was found to be in the LEAFY (LFY) gene. The mutation, a G-to-A exchange in the second exon of LFY, creates a novel lfy allele and causes a cysteine-to-tyrosine exchange in the 1-helix of the LFY DNA-binding domain. Whereas subcellular localization and homomerization are not affected, the DNA-binding of LFYFIF is abolished. We propose that the amino acid exchange interferes with the cooperative binding of LFY to its target DNA. To generate the strong fif phenotype, LFYFIF may act dominant-negatively by either forming non-binding LFY/LFYFIF heteromers or by titrating out the interaction partners, required for LFY function as transcription factor.

However, under certain conditions, its release into the atmosphere can be mitigated by methane-oxidizing microorganisms. Typically, cultivated wetlands (i.e., paddy fields) are a major source of methane (CH4) while forests and meadow uplands are considered to be CH4 sinks. As the global need for rice production increases each year, more uplands are converted to inundated paddy fields. To investigate soils that may be converted into productive land for rice production, we investigated a paddy field and adjacent meadow in Northern Italy. Using a combination of 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing to analyze the bacterial community, and gas flux measurements to quantify CH4 emissions, we looked for differences between classically defined CH4 sinks (meadow soils) and CH4 sources (paddy fields). Analysis of the total bacterial community revealed that the family Fimbriimonadaceae, which belongs to the phylum Armatimonadetes, was significantly higher in paddy field soils driving the difference between paddy and meadow soils. Whereas, we found that the methylotrophic families Methyloligellaceae and Methylomirabilaceae were also present in higher relative abundance in the paddy field. Despite these major differences, CH4 fluxes were highly variable between the two sites with no significant differences observed. Furthermore, we found the Methylomonaceae family to be more abundant at the center of a neighboring paddy field compared to the edge of the paddy field from the current study, hinting at methanotrophic variation based on location. Taking these results into account, we propose a conceptual model to explain possible scenarios that may result in paddy and meadow fields not exhibiting classical source/sink properties. These findings call for caution when including paddy and meadow areas separately into global CH4 flux calculations, and urge further research to discern drivers of CH4 cycling under a range of environmental conditions rather than relying on assumptions.",0,361,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/535229v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/535229v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_535229.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The abundance of selected peptides, which correspond to groups of BIN1 protein isoforms, was measured in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and their relation to neuropathological features of AD was assessed. Peptides contained in exon 7 of BIN1s N-BAR domain were found to be significantly associated with AD-related traits and, particularly, tau pathology. Since only isoforms 1, 2 and 3 contain exon 7, it appears that decreased protein expression of the N-BAR domain of BIN1 is associated with greater accumulation of tau pathology and subsequent cognitive decline, with astrocytic rather than neuronal BIN1 being the more likely culprit. These effects are independent of the BIN1 AD risk variant, suggesting that targeting specific BIN1 isoforms might be a novel therapeutic approach to prevent the accumulation of tau pathology.",1,397,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/535682v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/535682v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_535682.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Kentucky) can be a common causative agent of salmonellosis, usually associated with consumption of contaminated poultry. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to multiple drugs, including ciprofloxacin, is an emerging problem within this serotype. We used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate the phylogenetic structure and AMR content of 121 S. Kentucky ST198 isolates from five continents. Population structure was inferred using phylogenomic analysis and whole genomes were compared to investigate changes in gene content, with a focus on acquired AMR genes. Our analysis showed that multidrug resistant (MDR) S. Kentucky isolates belonged to a single lineage, which we estimate emerged circa 1989 following the acquisition of the AMR-associated Salmonella genomic island 1 (variant SGI1-K) conferring resistance ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole, and tetracycline. Phylogeographic analysis indicates this clone emerged in Egypt before disseminating into Northern, Southern and Western Africa, then to the Middle East, Asia and the European Union. The MDR clone has since accumulated various substitution mutations in the quinolone resistance determining regions (QRDR) of DNA gyrase (gyrA) and DNA topoisomerase (parC), such that most strains carry three QRDR mutations which together confer resistance to ciprofloxacin. The majority of AMR genes in the S. Kentucky genomes were carried either on plasmids or SGI structures. Remarkably, each genome carried a different SGI1-K derivative structure; this variation could be attributed to IS26-mediated insertions and deletions, which appear to have hampered previous attempts to trace the clone's evolution using sub-WGS resolution approaches. Several different AMR plasmids were also identified, encoding resistance to chloramphenicol, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems, and/or azithromycin. These results indicate that most MDR S. Kentucky circulating globally result from the clonal expansion of a single lineage that acquired chromosomal AMR genes 30 years ago, and has continued to diversify and accumulate additional resistances to last-line oral antimicrobials.",1,697,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/535914v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/535914v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_535914.txt,1,field-specific repository,1,kentucky strain 201001922 has been deposited into genbank under accession cp028357.;     short-read sequences have been deposited at the european nucleotide archive (ena) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena) under study accession number prjna445436 and the genome accession numbers are provided in table s1.;     kentucky st198 isolate 201001922 has been deposited in genbank under the accession number cp028357.,it is made available under acc-by 4.0 international license.  255 256 257 258 259 260 261 262 263 264 265 266 267 268 269 270 271 272 273 274 275 276 277 278 279 280 281 282 283 284 285 286 287 288 289 290 291 292 293 294 295 296 297 298 299 300 301 302 303 304  (https://github.com/katholt/reddog) to identify single nucleotide variants (snvs).

Annexins play a myriad of critical and well-characterized roles in mammals, ranging from membrane repair to vesicular secretion. The role of annexins in the kingdoms of bacteria, protozoa and fungi have been largely overlooked. The fact that there is no known homologue of annexins in the model organism may contribute to this gap in knowledge. However, annexins are found in most medically important fungal pathogens, with the notable exception of Candida albicans. In this study we evaluated the function of the one annexin gene in Cryptococcus neoformans, a causative agent of cryptococcosis. This gene CNAG_02415, is annotated in the C. neoformans genome as a target of calcineurin through its transcription factor Crz1, and we propose to update its name to cryptococcal annexin, AnnexinC1. C. neoformans strains deleted for AnnexinC1 revealed no difference in survival after exposure to various chemical stressor relative the wild type, as well as no major alteration in virulence or mating. The only alteration observed in strains deleted for AnnexinC1 was a small increase in the titan cells formation in vitro. The preservation of annexins in many different fungal species suggests an important function, and therefore the lack of a strong phenotype for annexin-deficient C. neoformans is suggestive of either redundant genes that can compensate for the absence of AnnexinC1 function or novel functions not revealed by standard assays of cell function and pathogenicity.

ImportanceCryptococcus neoformans is the deadliest human fungal pathogen, causing almost 200,000 deaths each year. Treatment of this lethal infection is lengthy, and in some patients therapy is not curative and patients require lifelong therapy. Fundamental research in this yeast is needed so that we can understand mechanisms of infection and disease and ultimately devise better therapies. In this work we investigated a fungal representative of the annexin family of proteins, specifically in the context of virulence and mating. We find that the cryptococcal annexin does not seem to be involved in virulence or mating but affects generation of titan cells, enlarged yeast cells that are detected in the lungs of mammalian hosts. Our data provides new knowledge in an unexplored area of fungal biology.",1,459,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/536193v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/536193v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_536193.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

While well appreciated, almost all analyses of GWAS data consider reported disease phenotype values as is without accounting for potential misclassification. Here, we introduce Phenotype Latent variable Extraction of disease misdiagnosis (PheLEx), a GWAS analysis framework that learns and corrects misclassified phenotypes using structured genotype associations within a dataset. PheLEx consists of a hierarchical Bayesian latent variable model, where inference of differential misclassification is accomplished using filtered genotypes while implementing a full mixed model to account for population structure and genetic relatedness in study populations. Through simulations, we show that the PheLEx framework dramatically improves recovery of the correct disease state when considering realistic allele effect sizes compared to existing methodologies designed for Bayesian recovery of disease phenotypes. We also demonstrate the potential of PheLEx for extracting new candidate loci from existing GWAS data by analyzing epilepsy and bipolar disorder phenotypes available from the UK Biobank dataset, where we identify new candidate disease loci not previously reported for these datasets that have biological connections to the disease phenotypes and/or were identified in independent GWAS. In the discussion, we consider both the broader consequences and importance of careful interpretation of misclassification correction in GWAS phenotypes, as well as potential of PheLEx for re-analyzing existing GWAS data to make novel discoveries.

Author SummaryPrevalent misdiagnosis of diseases due to lack of understanding and/or gold-standard diagnostic measures can impact any analytics that follow. These misdiagnosis errors are especially significant in the domain of psychiatric or psychological disorders where the definition of disease and/or their diagnostic tools are always in flux or under further improvement. Here, we propose a method to extract misdiagnosis from disease and infer the correct disease phenotype. We examined the performance of this method on rigorous simulations and real disease phenotypes obtained from the UK Biobank database. We found that this method successfully recovered misdiagnosed individuals in simulations using a carefully designed hierarchical Bayesian latent variable model framework. For real disease phenotypes, epilepsy and bipolar disorder, this method not only suggested an alternate phenotype but results from this method were also used to discover new genomic loci that have been previously showed to be associated with the respective phenotypes, suggesting that this method can be further used to reanalyze large-scale genetic datasets to discover novel loci that might be ignored using traditional methodologies.",1,409,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/536532v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/536532v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_536532.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Developmental refinement of the eye and visual system is regulated by light and visual stimulation. One compelling example is that fetal mouse pups deprived of light exhibit altered vascular development in their eyes. Previous work demonstrated that light activation of the photopigment melanopsin (Opn4), an atypical opsin expressed in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells (ipRGCs), is crucial to normal vascular development. This suggested the unusual hypothesis that vascular development of the eye was regulated by ipRGC responses in the fetal eye by light that traveled through the body wall of the mother. Here, we test the requirement of OPN4 during fetal stages using genetic approaches. The G-protein GNAQ (Gq) is a candidate mediator of melanopsin signaling. We show that ipRGC-specific deletion of Gnaq phenocopies both hyaloid and retinal vascular development of the Opn4 null mouse. Furthermore, GNAQ gain-of-function in Opn4-expressing cells only during late gestation was sufficient to reverse the consequences for vascular development of either dark rearing or Opn4 loss-of-function.

Increased prefrontal activity is associated with improved proprioception and motor performance. Anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has been found to increase activity of the sensorimotor cortex. Thus, this study aimed to investigate whether anodal tDCS of the DLPFC may enhance proprioception measured with a target task. It was hypothesized that tDCS over the left DLPFC would improve motor performance (error and variability) on a target task completed without vision.

DesignSingle blind, within-participant, sham-controlled trial.

MethodsFifteen healthy young adults (M:F=6:9, age=23.3 years) completed 18 trials of a computerized target task (manipulating a mouse) with their non-dominant upper-limb, with and without vision, before and after (pre/post assessment) 20-minutes of stimulation (anodal tDCS of the left DLPFC) and sham conditions. Averages and coefficient of variation (CV, variability between trials) of spatio-temporal parameters associated with the movement were measured. Stimulation/ sham sessions were counterbalanced (stimulation first session, n=8), with each session separated by one week. Repeated-measures ANOVA and pairwise comparisons (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were conducted.

ResultsRegarding distance travelled CV, a significant interaction between condition and assessment (F(1,14)=5.09, p=0.041) demonstrated that variability was significantly less post-stimulation compared to pre (p=0.003). A significant interaction between assessment and vision (F(1,14)=30.08, p<0.001) regarding distance travelled CV showed that without vision, variability was significantly less at post compared to pre (p<0.001), and this decrease was found after the stimulation condition only (95% CI = {Delta} 7.4 +/- 1.6 [4.0 to 10.9]).

ConclusionSince variability of distance travelled during the target task without vision was lower post-stimulation compared to pre, consistency of movement without vision, and therefore proprioception, may have been enhanced by anodal tDCS of the DLPFC. This improvement could be due to modulation of fronto-striatal-thalamic circuits. These findings may be the first step in developing tDCS methods as an effective adjunct therapy for dysfunctional proprioception in various disorders, such as Parkinsons disease.",0,731,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/539510v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/539510v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_539510.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Patients with 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS) have a 25-30% risk of developing schizophrenia, and also suffer frequent hearing loss. Here, we used the Df1/+ mouse model of 22q11.2DS to investigate the relationship between hearing loss and susceptibility to schizophrenia-relevant brain and behavioral abnormalities. Df1/+ mice have a multi-gene deletion analogous to the chromosomal microdeletion that causes human 22q11.2DS, and like human 22q11.2DS patients exhibit high rates of hearing loss arising primarily from susceptibility to middle ear inflammation. We found that hearing loss in Df1/+ mice affected schizophrenia-relevant endophenotypes, including electrophysiological measures of central auditory gain and behavioral measures of auditory sensorimotor gating. Moreover, PV+ inhibitory interneurons, another marker for schizophrenia pathology, were significantly reduced in density in auditory cortex but not secondary motor cortex of Df1/+ mice with hearing loss. These results reveal bottom-up neurobiological mechanisms through which peripheral hearing loss arising from the 22q11.2 deletion may promote the emergence of schizophrenia-relevant auditory brain and behavioral abnormalities, and also suggest a link between conductive hearing loss and reduced PV+ interneuron density in the auditory cortex.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENTHearing loss is a known risk factor for schizophrenia. Deletion of chromosomal locus 22q11.2 is associated with both schizophrenia and hearing loss in humans. In the Df1/+ mouse model of human 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome, we find that hearing loss shapes measures that are considered schizophrenia-relevant endophenotypes, such as central auditory gain and auditory sensorimotor gating.

We used X-ray computed microtomography (μ-CT) to better document its anatomy and phylogenetic affinities. μ-CT reveals parts of the internal skeleton. We correct errors in original description, including the number of infraorbital bones and the misidentification of the dermosphenotic as sclerotic ossifications. These reinterpretations of external anatomy are joined by new data on internal structure, including the palate, parasphenoid, and branchial and hyoid arches. A maximum parsimony analysis of anatomical data resolves Brazilichthys as a stem actinopterygian, crownward of all Devonian species. This placement is supported by the absence of a dermosphenotic posterior ramus and the presence of opercular process of the hyomandibula. A similar placement is suggested by a Bayesian analysis of this same dataset, although relationships throughout the tree are less resolved. Our results reject previous interpretations of Brazilichthys as a relative of Birgeriidae, a Triassic group consistently placed within the actinopterygian crown. Although Acrolepis is too poorly known to be included in our analysis, we also reject a close relationship between this taxon and Brazilichthys, as their only shared similarities appear to be broadly distributed among early actinopterygians.View Full Text",1,845,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/540310v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/540310v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_540310.txt,1,"general-purpose repository, supplement",0,blender models exported as .ply files and the tomographic stack are publically available through the following link: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7600103. 6   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/540310; this version posted february 5 2019.;     the strict consensus tree with the character mapping is available through the link: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7600103. 7   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/540310; this version posted february 5 2019.;     the bayesian consensus with all mapped synapomorphies is available through the link: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.7600103.  the complete matrix contains 93 taxa and 265 unweighted characters (supplementary data 1).;     a formatted file is provided in supplementary data 2 to reproduce results of the parsimony analysis.;     the most parsimonious trees (supplementary data 3) were used to calculate the strict consensus topology and the file was exported to mesquite (maddison and maddison 2018) where we mapped the evolution of each character based on the likelihood and parsimony algorithms (lewis 2001).;     a complete script for mrbayes is given in supplementary data 4.;     the resulting phylogram (supplementary data 5) was visualized in figtree 1.4.3 (rambaut 2018) and the tree file was exported to mesquite (maddison and maddison 2018) where we mapped the evolution of each character based on the likelihood and parsimony algorithms (lewis 2001).;     a complete list of synapomorphies for the node uniting brazilichthys and post-devonian taxa is available in supplementary data 4.,NA

Contemporary machine-learning may improve risk-prediction by identifying complex relationships between predictors and outcomes.

Methods and ResultsWe studied 993,905 patients in the American College of Cardiology Chest Pain-MI Registry hospitalized with AMI (mean age 64 {+/-} 13 years, 34% women) between January 2011 and December 2016. We developed and validated three machine learning models to predict in-hospital mortality and compared the performance characteristics with a logistic regression model. In an independent validation cohort, we compared logistic regression with lasso regularization (c-statistic, 0.891 [95% CI, 0.890-0.892]), gradient descent boosting (c-statistic, 0.902 [0.901-0.903]), and meta-classification that combined gradient descent boosting with a neural network (c-statistic, 0.904 [0.903-0.905]) with traditional logistic regression (c-statistic, 0.882 [0.881-0.883]). There were improvements in classification of individuals across the spectrum of patient risk with each of the three methods; the meta-classifier model - our best performing model - reclassified 20.9% of individuals deemed high-risk for mortality in logistic regression appropriately as low-to-moderate risk, and 8.2% of deemed low-risk to moderate-to-high risk based consistent with the actual event rates.

Neural responses recorded using electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG) can be used to study how our brain functions, as well as for various promising brain computer interface (BCI) applications. However, a common problem is the low signal to noise ratio (SNR) which makes it challenging to estimate task-related neural responses or the temporal response function (TRF) describing the linear relationship between the stimulus and the neural response, particularly over short data windows. To address these, we present an algorithm that takes advantage of the multi-channel nature of the recordings, and knowledge of the presented stimulus, to achieve a joint noise reduction and dimensionality reduction using spatial filtering. Methods. Forward modeling is used to project the stimulus onto the electrode space. The second-order statistics of this estimated desired signal and the raw neural data are used to estimate spatial filters that maximize the SNR of the neural response, based on a generalized eigenvalue decomposition. Main Results. 1. For synthesized EEG data, over a range of SNRs, our filtering resulted in significantly better TRF estimates from 20 s trials, compared to unfiltered EEG data. 2. On a dataset from 28 subjects who listened to a single-talker stimulus, our method resulted in correlations between predicted neural responses and the original EEG data that were significantly higher compared to standard approaches. 3. On a dataset of 16 subjects attending to 1 speaker in a two-speaker scenario, our method resulted in attention decoding accuracies which were higher compared to existing forward modelling methods. Significance. Our algorithm presents a data-driven way to denoise and reduce dimensionality of neural data, thus aiding further analysis, by utilizing the knowledge of the stimulus. The method is computationally efficient, and does not require repeated trials, thereby relieving experiment design from the necessity of presenting repeated stimuli to the subjects.",1,52,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/541318v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/541318v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_541318.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

This signaling, which is highly regulated, is initiated by pattern recognition receptors, such as RIG-I, that sense viral RNA and then signal to the adaptor protein, MAVS. This adaptor protein then recruits additional signaling proteins, including TRAF3 and TBK1, to form a signaling complex that results in IRF3 activation for transcriptional induction of IFN. Here, we show that the GTPase trafficking protein RAB1B positively regulates RIG-I signaling to promote IFN-{beta} induction and the antiviral response. Over-expression of RAB1B increases RIG-I-mediated signaling to IFN-{beta}, while deletion results in reduced signaling of this pathway. Additionally, this loss of RAB1B results in a dampened antiviral response, as Zika virus infection is enhanced in the absence of RAB1B. Importantly, we identified the mechanism of RAB1B action by determining that it interacts with TRAF3 to facilitate the interaction of TRAF3 with MAVS. Thus, we identified RAB1B as a regulator of TRAF3 to promote the formation of innate immune signaling complexes in response to nucleic acid sensing.",1,877,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/542050v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/542050v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_542050.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, whether a prior cancer diagnosis affects trial outcomes is still unknown. We aimed to determine the impact of prior cancer on survival in NPC.

MethodsWe identified patients diagnosed with NPC between 2004 and 2009 in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Variables were compared by chi-squared test and t-test as appropriate. Propensity score-adjusted Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate the impact of prior cancer on overall survival (OS).

ResultsAmong 3,131 eligible NPC patients, 349 (11.15%) patients had a history of prior cancer. The Kaplan-Meier curves did not show a statistically significantly different OS (p=0.19). Subgroup analyses stratified by timing of prior cancer and AJCC TNM stage of index cancer displayed the same tendency, prior cancer didnt adversely affect OS compared with patients without prior cancer (p>0.05). Furthermore, in propensity score-adjusted COX models analysis, patients with prior cancer had the same/non-inferior OS (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.12, 95% confidence interval= 0.88 to 1.42).

ConclusionsAmong patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, prior cancer does not convey an adverse effect on clinical outcomes, regardless of the timing of prior cancer and AJCC TNM stage of index cancer.

A new strategy enabling electrical stimulation of bacteria with simultaneous monitoring of single-cell membrane potential dynamics would allow bridging this knowledge gap and further extend electrophysiological studies into the field of microbiology. Here we report that an identical electrical stimulus can cause opposite polarization dynamics depending on cellular proliferation capacity. This was demonstrated using two model organisms, namely B. subtilis and E. coli, and by developing an apparatus enabling exogenous electrical stimulation and single-cell time-lapse microscopy. Using this bespoke apparatus, we show that a 2.5 sec electrical stimulation causes hyperpolarization in unperturbed cells. Measurements of intracellular K+ and the deletion of the K+ channel suggested that the hyperpolarization response is caused by the K+ efflux through the channel. When cells are pre-exposed to UV-violet light, the same electrical stimulation depolarizes cells instead of causing hyperpolarization. A mathematical model extended from the FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron model suggested that the opposite response dynamics are due to the shift in resting membrane potential. As predicted by the model, electrical stimulation only induced depolarization when cells are treated with antibiotics, protonophore or alcohol. Therefore, electrically induced membrane potential dynamics offer a novel and reliable approach for rapid detection of proliferative bacteria and determination of their sensitivity to antimicrobial agents at the single-cell level.",1,322,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/542746v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/542746v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_542746.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Previous studies investigating ATP-mediated cardenolide insensitivity in five insect orders have revealed remarkably high levels of parallelism in the evolution of this trait, including the frequent occurrence of parallel amino acid substitutions at two sites and recurrent episodes of duplication followed by neo-functionalisation. Here we add data for a sixth insect order, Orthoptera, which includes an ancient group of highly aposematic cardenolide-sequestering grasshoppers in the family Pyrgomorphidae.

These are whole-brain states in which the voxelwise-normalized BOLD (vnBOLD) activation of a large proportion of voxels is simultaneously either very high or very low. The presence of such states during a resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) scan is significantly anti-correlated with diagnosed schizophrenia, significantly anti-correlated with connectivity between subcortical networks and auditory, visual and sensorimotor networks and also significantly anti-correlated with contemporaneous occupancy of transient functional network connectivity states featuring broad disconnectivity or strong inhibitory connections between the default mode and other networks. Conversely, the presence of highly polarized vn-BOLD states is significantly correlated with connectivity strength between auditory, visual and sensorimotor networks and with contemporaneous occupancy of transient whole-brain patterns of strongly modularized network connectivity and diffuse hyperconnectivity. Despite their consistency with well-documented effects of schizophrenia on static and time-varying functional network connectivity, the observed relationships between polarization and network connectivity are with very few exceptions unmediated by schizophrenia diagnosis. We also find that the spatial distribution of voxels most likely to contribute to the highly polarized states (polarity participation maps (PPMs)) differs with a high degree of statistical significance between schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Finally, we report evidence suggesting the process by which the most polarized states are achieved, i.e. the ways that strongly polarized voxel regions extend, merge and recede also differs significantly between patient and control populations. Many differences observed between patients and controls are echoed within the patient population itself in the effect patterns of positive symptomology (e.g. hallucinations, delusions, grandiosity and other positive symptoms of schizophrenia).

To deal with a diverse set of stresses, bacteria are able to reprogram gene expression using a wide variety of transcription factors. Here, we focused on the MarR-type regulator MalR conserved in the Corynebacterineae, including the prominent pathogens Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In several corynebacterial species, the malR gene forms an operon with a gene encoding a universal stress protein (uspA). Chromatin-affinity purification and sequencing (ChAP-Seq) analysis revealed that MalR binds more than 60 target promoters in the C. glutamicum genome as well as in the large cryptic prophage CGP3. Overproduction of MalR caused severe growth defects and an elongated cell morphology. ChAP-Seq data combined with a global transcriptome analysis of the malR overexpression strain emphasized a central role of MalR in cell envelope remodeling in response to environmental stresses. Prominent MalR targets are for example involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis and synthesis of branched-chain fatty acids. Phenotypic microarrays suggest an altered sensitivity of a {Delta}malR mutant towards several {beta}-lactam antibiotics. We furthermore revealed MalR as a repressor of several prophage genes suggesting that MalR may be involved in the control of stress-responsive induction of the large CGP3 element. In conclusion, our results emphasize MalR as a regulator involved in stress-responsive remodeling of the cell envelope of C. glutamicum and suggest a link between cell envelope stress and the control of phage gene expression.

ImportanceBacteria live in changing environments that force the cells to be highly adaptive. The cell envelope represents both, a barrier against harsh external conditions and an interaction interface. The dynamic remodeling of the cell envelope as a response towards, e.g. antibiotic treatment represents a major challenge in the treatment of diseases. Members of the MarR family of regulators are known to contribute to an adaptation of bacterial cells towards antibiotic stress.

The use of children in employment in developing economies constitutes a major threat to the societies, and concerted efforts are made by the relevant stakeholders towards addressing some of the factors/issues responsible for the menace. Significant risk factors include socio-demographic and economic factors, including poverty, neglect, lack of adequate care, and exposure of children to various grades of violence, parental education status, gender, place of residence, household size, residences type or size, wealth index, parental survivorship and household size.

ObjectivesThis study, therefore, focuses on identifying socio-demographic/economic and geospatial factors associated with child labour participation.

MethodsWe utilised 2014 Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS) from the Ministry health and Population in Egypt, with the record of 20, 560 never married children aged 5-17years engaging in economic activities, in and out of their home. The data focused on demographic and socio-economic characteristics of household members. Multivariate Bayesian geo-additive models were employed to examine the demographical and socio-economic factors for children working less than 16hrs; between 16 and 45hrs and above 45hrours weekly.

ResultsThe results showed that at least 31.6% of the children in the age group from 5-10 were working, 68.5% of children aged 11-17 years engaging in child labour (wage), while 44.7 of the children in the age group from 5-10 were engaged in hazard work. From the multivariate Bayesian geo-additive models, the female children (with male children as reference category) working at least 16hrs (OR: 1.3; with 95% CI: 1.2-1.5) are more likely to be engaged in child labour than those working 16 to 45hours (OR: 1; 95% CI: 0.3-1.5). Children born to women without formal education, under non-hazardous jobs, irrespective of the hours spent at work, were mostly exposed to child labour with following percentages: 52.9%, 56.8%, 62.4%, compared to children of mothers with some levels of education. Finally, children that have experienced psychological aggression and physical punishment are mostly exposed to child labour than those without such experience across the job types and hours spent.

ConclusionThis study revealed a significant influence of socio-demographic and economic factors on the children labour and violence against children in Egypt. Poverty neglects, lack of adequate care and exposures of children to various grades of violence are major drivers of child labour across the country.

We identified a heterozygous missense RAD21 variant in a non-cons anguineous Chinese family with multiple peripheral sclerocomea patients spanning across three generations inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

MethodsComprehensive ophthalmic examinations were conducted on all 14 members. Whole exome sequencing was used to identify the genetic alterations in the affected pedigree members. Lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs) were established using blood samples from all members. Cleavage of RAD21 protein was quantified in these cell lines.

ResultsAll affected individuals showed features of scleralization over the peripheral cornea of both eyes. Mean horizontal and vertical corneal diameter were significantly decreased in the affected members. Significant differences were also observed on mean apex pachymetry between affected and unaffected subjects. A RAD21C1348T variant was co-segregated with affected members. Both the wild-type allele and the missense variant were expressed at the mRNA level. This variant caused RAD21 R450C substitution at the separase cleavage site, which led to reduced RAD21 cleavage.

Given recent advances in quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) we sought to tackle the unresolved question about the link between the presumed injury associated volume differences and underlying brain tissue property changes in a cohort of chronic complete SCI patients. Using the established computational anatomy methods of voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and voxel-based quantification (VBQ) we performed statistical analyses of grey matter volume and parameter maps indicative for brains myelin, iron and free tissue water content in complete SCI patients (n=14) and healthy individuals (n=14). Our whole-brain analysis showed significant white matter volume loss in the rostral and dorsal part of the spinal cord consistent with Wallerian degeneration of proprioceptive axons in the lemniscal tract in SCI subjects, which correlated with spinal cord atrophy assessed with quantification of the spinal cord cross-sectional area at cervical level. The latter finding suggests that Wallerian degeneration of the lemniscal tract represents a main contributor to the observed spinal cord atrophy, which is highly consistent with preclinical ultrastructural/histological evidence of remote changes in the central nervous system secondary to SCI. Structural changes in the brain representing remote changes in the course of chronic SCI could not be confirmed with conventional VBM or VBQ statistical analysis.

Typically, oscillations and synchronization take place concurrently in many distinct frequencies, which serve separate computational roles in cognitive functions. While within-frequency phase synchronization has been studied extensively, less is known about the mechanisms that govern neuronal processing distributed across frequencies and brain regions. Such integration of processing between frequencies could be achieved via cross-frequency coupling (CFC), either by phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) or by n:m-cross-frequency phase synchrony (CFS). So far, studies have mostly focused on local CFC in individual brain regions, whereas the presence and functional organization of CFC between brain areas have remained largely unknown. We posit that inter-areal CFC may be essential for large-scale coordination of neuronal activity and investigate here whether genuine CFC networks are present in human resting-state brain activity.

To assess the functional organization of CFC networks, we identified brain-wide CFC networks at meso-scale resolution from stereo-electroencephalography (SEEG) and at macro-scale resolution from source-reconstructed magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We developed a novel graph-theoretical method to distinguish genuine CFC from spurious CFC that may arise from non-sinusoidal signals ubiquitous in neuronal activity. We show that genuine inter-areal CFC is present in human resting-state activity in both MEG and SEEG data. Both CFS and PAC networks coupled theta and alpha oscillations with higher frequencies in large-scale networks connecting anterior and posterior brain regions. CFS and PAC networks had distinct spectral patterns and opposing distribution of low- and high frequency network hubs, implying that they constitute distinct CFC mechanisms. The strength of CFS networks was also predictive of cognitive performance in a separate neuropsychological assessment. In conclusion, these results provide evidence for inter-areal CFS and PAC being two distinct mechanisms for coupling oscillations across frequencies in large-scale brain networks.",1,225,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/547638v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/547638v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_547638.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In visual cortices, auditory stimulation induced widespread inhibition irrespective of attention, whereas auditory relative to visual attention suppressed mainly central visual field representations. In auditory cortices, visual stimulation suppressed activations, but amplified responses to concurrent auditory stimuli, in a patchy topography. Critically, multisensory interactions in auditory cortices were stronger in deeper laminae, while attentional influences were greatest at the surface.

Synthetic biologists typically impose explicit genetic control of cell-cell communication and programmable cell state to realize engineered biological patterns. Such engineering approaches do not usually consider the underlying physical properties of individual cells that inevitably contribute to pattern development. To better integrate synthetic genetic systems engineering with natural growth and patterning we derived abstract functions that relate how changes in basic cell properties such as growth rate, length, and radius of curvature result in differences in the curvature, end-point reliability, and texture of borders that define boundaries among growing cell lineages. Each abstracted border function is derived holistically as an emergent consequence of underlying cell physical properties. We experimentally demonstrate control of border curvature to angles of 60{degrees} from initial trajectories, control of end-point variability to within 15{degrees} of desired target endpoints, and control of border texture between 10 to 60 unit cell lengths. In combination with synthetic genetic control systems, we grow arbitrary two-dimensional patterns including phases of the moon, PacMen, and a yinyang-like pattern.

Some of these SNPs may contribute to disease by regulating gene splicing. Here, we investigate whether SNPs that are associated with alternative splicing (splice QTL or sQTL) can identify novel functions for existing GWAS variants or suggest new associated variants in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

RNA sequencing was performed on whole blood from 376 subjects from the COPDGene Study. Using linear models, we identified 561,060 unique sQTL SNPs associated with 30,333 splice sites corresponding to 6,419 unique genes. Similarly, 708,928 unique eQTL SNPs involving 15,913 genes were detected at 10% FDR. While there is overlap between sQTLs and eQTLs, 60% of sQTLs are not eQTLs. Co-localization analysis revealed that 7 out of 21 loci associated with COPD (p<1x10-6) in a published GWAS have at least one shared causal variant between the GWAS and sQTL studies. Among the genes identified to have splice sites associated with top GWAS SNPs was FBXO38, in which a novel exon was discovered to be protective against COPD. Importantly, the sQTL in this locus was validated by qPCR in both blood and lung tissue, demonstrating that splice variants relevant to lung tissue can be identified in blood. Other identified genes included CDK11A and SULT1A2.

Overall, these data indicate that analysis of alternative splicing can provide novel insights into disease mechanisms. In particular, we demonstrated that SNPs in a known COPD GWAS locus on chromosome 5q32 influence alternative splicing in the gene FBXO38.

Author SummaryWhile it is known that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is caused in part by genetic factors, few studies have identified specific causative genes. Genetic variants that alter the expression levels of genes have explained part of the genetic component of COPD, however, there are additional genetic variants with unknown function. In some genes the protein coding sequence can be altered by a mechanism known as RNA splicing. We hypothesized that some genetic variants that are associated with risk of COPD contribute to the disease by altering RNA splicing. In this study, we identified genetic variants that are associated both with COPD risk and RNA splicing. In particular, we found that a COPD associated variant of previously unknown function may contribute to the inclusion of a new exon in the FBXO38 gene. These finding are significant because they indicate that analysis of RNA splicing can help identify genes that contribute to disease.",1,336,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/549626v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/549626v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_549626.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Focusing on resilience mechanisms, such as diversity, network architectures or adaptive capacity, has recently been suggested as means to operationalize resilience. Still, the focus on mechanisms is not specific enough because the usefulness of a mechanism is context-dependent. We suggest a conceptual framework, resilience trinity, to facilitate management of resilience mechanisms in three distinctive decision contexts and time-horizons. i) reactive, when there is an imminent threat to ES resilience and a high pressure to act, ii) adjustive, when the threat is known in general but there is still time to adapt management, and iii) provident when time horizons are very long and the nature of the threats is uncertain, leading to a low willingness to act. This emphasizes that resilience has different interpretations and implications at different time horizons which however need to be reconciled. The inclusion of time into resilience thinking ensures that longer-term management actions are not missed while urgent threats to ES are given priority.",1,367,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/549873v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/549873v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_549873.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Despite life-long infection, the role of latent toxoplasmosis on chronic neurodegenerative processes is poorly understood. Huntingtons disease (HD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a dominant CAG repeat expansion in the huntingtin gene (HTT) that results in the expression and accumulation of mutant huntingtin protein (mHTT). The mutant HD gene is fully penetrant. However, there is significant variability in disease progression that is in part explained by as yet unidentified environmental factors. The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism (KP) is an inflammatory pathway and its activation is implicated in HD pathogenesis. KP upregulation also occurs in response to infection with Toxoplasma gondii suggesting that the latent infection may promote HD. We discovered that mice on the FVB/NJ background develop latent toxoplasmosis following infection with the ME49 strain of T. gondii. This finding enabled us to address the hypothesis that latent toxoplasmosis potentiates disease in the YAC128 mouse model of HD, as these mice are maintained on the FVB/NJ background. Wild-type and HD mice were infected at 2-months of age. During the 10-month follow-up, infection had adverse effects on mice of both genotypes. However, YAC128 HD mice demonstrated specific vulnerability to latent toxoplasmosis, as demonstrated by the presence of increased striatal degeneration, high levels of the blood neurodegeneration marker neurofilament light protein, and elevated brain soluble mHTT.

Instead, plasmids generally integrate into the genome. Here, we assessed plasmid and transformant properties, including plasmid geometry, transformant colony size, four selectable markers, and potential origins of replication for their ability to drive autonomous plasmid maintenance. Importantly, linear plasmids with terminal telomere repeats yielded many more autonomous transformants than circular plasmids with the identical sequences.

Furthermore, we could distinguish by colony size, transient, autonomously replicating and chromosomally integrated transformants (tiny, medium and large, respectively). Candida albicans URA3 and a heterologous marker, ARG4, yielded many transient transformants indicative of weak origin activity; replication of plasmid carrying heterologous LEU2 marker was highly dependent upon the addition of a bona fide origin sequence. Several bona fide chromosomal origins, with an origin fragment of ~100 bp as well as a heterologous origin, panARS, from Kluyveromyces lactis drove autonomous replication, yielding moderate transformation efficiency and plasmid stability. Thus, C. albicans maintains linear plasmids that yield high transformation efficiency and are maintained autonomously in an origin-dependent manner.

ImportanceCircular plasmids are important tools for molecular manipulation in model fungi such as bakers yeast, yet, in Candida albicans, an important yeast pathogen of humans, prior studies were not able to generate circular plasmids that were autonomous (duplicated without inserting themselves into the chromosome). Here, we found that linearizing circular plasmids with sequences from telomeres, the chromosome ends, allows the plasmids to duplicate and segregate in C. albicans. We used this system to identify chromosomal sequences that facilitate the initiation of plasmid replication (origins) and to show that a ~100 bp fragment of a C. albicans origin, as well as an origin sequence from a distantly related yeast, can both function as origins in C. albicans. Thus, the requirements for plasmid geometry, but not necessarily for origin sequences, differ between C. albicans and bakers yeast.",1,453,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/551127v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/551127v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_551127.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Organ development relies on a tightly regulated interplay between extrinsic signaling cues and cell intrinsic factors. At present, however, there is limited knowledge about the specific extrinsic signaling cues that regulate foregut endoderm patterning, thyroid cell specification and subsequent morphogenetic processes in thyroid development.

MethodsTo begin to address this problem in a systematic way, we used zebrafish embryos to perform a series of in vivo phenotype-driven chemical genetic screens to identify signaling cues regulating early thyroid development. For this purpose, we treated zebrafish embryos during different developmental periods with a panel of small molecule compounds known to manipulate the activity of major signaling pathways and scored phenotypic deviations in thyroid, endoderm and cardiovascular development using whole mount in situ hybridization and transgenic fluorescent reporter models.

ResultsSystematic assessment of drugged embryos recovered a range of thyroid phenotypes including expansion, reduction or lack of the early thyroid anlage, defective thyroid budding as well as hypoplastic, enlarged or overtly disorganized presentation of the thyroid primordium after budding. Our pharmacological screening identified BMP and FGF signaling as key factors for thyroid specification and early thyroid organogenesis, highlight the importance of low Wnt activities during early development for thyroid specification and implicate drug-induced cardiac and vascular anomalies as likely indirect mechanisms causing various forms of thyroid dysgenesis.

ConclusionsBy integrating the outcome of our screening efforts with previously available information from other model organisms including Xenopus, chicken and mouse, we conclude that signaling cues regulating thyroid development appear broadly conserved across vertebrates. We therefore expect that observations made in zebrafish can inform mammalian models of thyroid organogenesis to further our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of congenital thyroid diseases.",1,597,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/551861v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/551861v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_551861.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

They have the modified pedal digit II that characterize all dromeosaurids, which is typically related to predation. However, derived Laurasian dromaeosaurids (eudromaeosaurs) differ from unenlagiines in having a shorter metatarsus and pedal phalanx II-1, and more ginglymoid articular surfaces in metatarsals and pedal phalanges. Further, unenlagiines have a subarctometatarsal condition, which could have increased the mechanical efficiency during locomotion. All these discrepancies possibly reflect different locomotor and predatory habits. To evaluate this we conducted morphometric analyses and comparisons of qualitative morphological aspects. The former consisted in two phylogenetic principal component analyses, one of them based on lengths of femur, tibia and metatarsus, and width of metatarsus, and the other based on lengths of pedal phalanges. The data sampling covered several coelurosaurian and non-coelurosaurian taxa. The first analysis showed the unenlagiines close to taxa with long tibiae and long and slender metatarsi, which are features considered to provide high cursorial capacities. Instead, eudromaeosaurs are close to taxa with shorter tibiae and shorter and wider metatarsi, which can be considered with low cursorial capacities. The second analysis showed that eudromaeosaurs and unenlagiines have similar phalangeal proportions. Moreover, they share the elongation of distal phalanges, which is a feature related to the capacity of grasping. The shorter and wider metatarsus, more ginglymoid articular surfaces and a shorter pedal phalanx II-2 of eudromaeosaurs possibly allowed them to exert a greater gripping strength. Thus, they had the potential of hunting large prey. Instead, the longer and slender subarctometatarsus, lesser ginglymoid articular surfaces and a longer pedal phalanx II-2 of unenlagiines possibly gave to them greater cursorial capacities and the ability to hunt smaller and elusive prey on the ground.

However, the underlying mechanisms of some features of the muscle activation patterns and their differential appearance on different species are still obscure. In this study, we explain the muscle activation patterns by using 3D computational fluid dynamics models coupled to the motion of fish with prescribed deformation and examining the torque and power required along the fish body with two primary swimming modes. We find that the torque required by the hydrodynamic forces and body inertia exhibits a wave pattern that travels faster than the curvature wave in both anguilliform and carangiform swimmers, which can explain the traveling wave speeds of the muscle activations. Most interestingly, intermittent negative power (i.e., power delivered by the fluid to the body) on the posterior part, along with a timely transfer of torque and energy by tendons, explains the decrease of the duration of muscle activation towards the tail. The torque contribution from the body elasticity further solves the mystery of the wave speed increase or the reverse of the wave direction of the muscle activation on the posterior part of a carangiform swimmer. For anguilliform swimmers, the absence of the changes mentioned above in the muscle activation on the posterior part is in line with our torque prediction and the absence of long tendons from experimental observations. These results provide novel insights into the function of muscles and tendons as an integrative part of the internal driving system, especially from an energy perspective, and highlight the differences in the internal driving systems between the two primary swimming modes.

Author summaryFor undulatory swimming, fish form posteriorly traveling waves of body bending by activating their muscles sequentially along the body. However, experimental observations have showed that the muscle activation wave does not simply match the bending wave. Researchers have previously computed the torque required for muscles along the body based on classic hydrodynamic theories and explained the higher wave speed of the muscle activation compared to the curvature wave. However, the origins of other features of the muscle activation pattern and their variation among different species are still obscure after decades of research. In this study, we use 3D computational fluid dynamics models to compute the spatiotemporal distributions of both the torque and power required for eel-like and mackerel-like swimming. By examining both the torque and power patterns and considering the energy transfer, storage, and release by tendons and body viscoelasticity, we can explain not only the features and variations in the muscle activation patterns as observed from fish experiments but also how tendons and body elasticity save energy. We provide a mechanical picture in which the body shape, body movement, muscles, tendons, and body elasticity of a mackerel (or similar) orchestrate to make swimming efficient.",1,312,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/556126v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/556126v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_556126.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, Fe0 corrosion by complex environmental communities, and especially the interplay between microbial physiological groups, is still poorly understood. In this study, we combined experimental physiology and metagenomics to explore Fe0-dependent microbial interactions between physiological groups enriched from anoxic climate lake sediments. Then, we investigated how each physiological group interacts with Fe0. We offer evidence for a new interspecies interaction during Fe0 corrosion. We showed that acetogens enhanced methanogenesis but were negatively impacted by methanogens (opportunistic microbial interaction). Methanogens were positively impacted by acetogens. In the metagenome of the corrosive community, the acetogens were mostly represented by Clostridium and Eubacterium, the methanogens by Methanosarcinales, Methanothermobacter and Methanobrevibacter. Within the corrosive community, acetogens and methanogens produced acetate and methane concurrently, however at rates that cannot be explained by abiotic H2-buildup at the Fe0 surface. Thus, microbial-induced corrosion might have occurred via a direct or enzymatically mediated electron uptake from Fe0. The shotgun metagenome of Clostridium within the corrosive community contained several H2-releasing enzymes including [FeFe]-hydrogenases, which could boost Fe0-dependent H2-formation as previously shown for pure culture acetogens. Outside the cell, acetogenic hydrogenases could become a common good for any H2/CO2-consuming member in the microbial community including methanogens that rely on Fe0 as a sole energy source. However, the exact electron uptake mechanism from Fe0 remains to be unraveled.",1,400,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/556704v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/556704v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_556704.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

They have been long known to play a fundamental role in bacterial conjugation and virulence of several species. It was recently shown that a subtype of T4SS harboured by the plant pathogenic bacterium Xanthomonas citri transfers toxins into other bacteria cells resulting in cell death. In this study, we show that a similar T4SS from the multi-drug-resistant global opportunistic pathogen Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is proficient in killing competitor bacterial species. T4SS-dependent duelling between S. maltophilia and X. citri was observed by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. A bioinformatic search of the S. maltophilia K279a genome for proteins containing a C-terminal domain (XVIPCD) conserved in X. citri T4SS effectors identified eleven putative effectors secreted by the S. maltophilia T4SS. Six of these effectors have no recognizable domain except for the XVIPCD. We selected one of these new effectors (Smlt3024) and its cognate inhibitor (Smlt3025) for further characterization and confirmed that Smlt3024 is indeed secreted in a T4SS-dependent manner by S. maltophilia when in contact with a target bacterial species. Expression of Smlt3024 in the periplasm of E. coli resulted in greatly reduced growth rate and cell size, which could be counteracted by co-expression with its cognate periplasmic inhibitor, Smlt3025. This work expands our current knowledge about the diverse function of T4SSs subtypes and increases the panel of effectors known to be involved in T4SS-mediated interbacterial competition. Further elucidation of the mechanism of these antibacterial proteins could lead to the discovery of new antibacterial targets. The study also adds information about the molecular mechanisms possibly contributing to the establishment of S. maltophilia in different biotic and abiotic surfaces in both clinical and environmental settings.

Author SummaryCompetition between microorganisms for nutrients and space determines which species will emerge and dominate or be eradicated from a specific habitat. Bacteria use a series of mechanisms to kill or prevent multiplication of competitor species. Recently, it was reported that a subtype of type IV secretion system (T4SS) works as a weapon to kill competitor bacterial species. In this study, we show that an important human opportunistic pathogen, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, harbours a T4SS that promotes killing of competitor species. We also identified a series of new toxic proteins secreted by S. maltophilia via its T4SS to poison competitor species. We showed that two different bacterial species that harbour a bacteria-killing T4SS can kill each other; most likely due to differences in effector-immunity protein pairs. This work expands our current knowledge about the bacterial arsenal used in competitions with other species and expands the repertoire of antibacterial ammunition fired by T4SSs. In addition, the work contributes with knowledge on the possible mechanisms used by S. maltophilia to establish communities in different biotic and abiotic surfaces in both clinical and environmental settings.",1,414,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/557322v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/557322v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_557322.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, the molecular mechanisms by which ADCs are internalized and activated within cells remain unclear. Here we use CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify genes that control the toxicity of ADCs. Our results demonstrate critical roles for a range of known and novel endolysosomal trafficking regulators in ADC toxicity. We identify and characterize C18orf8/RMC1 as a regulator of ADC toxicity through its role in endosomal maturation. Through comparative analysis of CRISPR screens with ADCs bearing a noncleavable linker versus a cleavable valine-citrulline (VC) linker, we show that a subset of late endosomal and lysosomal regulators are selectively essential for toxicity of noncleavable linker ADCs. We further show that cleavable VC linkers are rapidly processed upon internalization and therefore surprisingly appear to bypass the requirement of lysosomal delivery. Lastly, we show that inhibition of sialic acid biosynthesis sensitizes cells to ADC treatment by increasing the rate of ADC internalization. This sensitization was observed using several ADCs targeting different antigens in diverse cancer cell types, including the FDA-approved ADC trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) in Her2-positive breast cancer cells. Together, these results reveal novel regulators of endolysosomal trafficking, provide important insights to guide future ADC design, and identify candidate combination therapy targets as well as potential mechanisms of ADC resistance.",0,603,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/557454v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/557454v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_557454.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

These accumulations lead to the development of atherosclerotic plaques. The rupture of plaques that contain lipid-rich necrotic cores can trigger heart attacks and strokes via occlusion of blood vessels. We construct and analyse a system of partial integro-differential equations that model lipid accumulation by macrophages, including generating apoptotic cells and a necrotic core. The model includes the following cell behaviours: recruitment of macrophages into the plaque; macrophage ingestion of low density lipoproteins LDL and of apoptotic cells and necrotic material; lipid offloading to high density lipoproteins (HDL); macrophage emigration; and macrophage apoptosis and necrosis of apoptotic cells. With this model, we study how changes in parameters predict the characteristic features of plaque pathology. In particular, we find the qualitative form of lipid distribution across the macrophage population and show that high lipid loads can occur in the absence of LDL ingestion. We also demonstrate the importance of macrophage emigration in the model in mitigating and resolving inflammation and plaque lipid accumulation.

It is therefore unclear for potential users which tool best fits the purpose of their research. In this work, we performed a systematic assessment of the current genome-scale reconstruction software platforms. To meet our goal, we first defined a list of features for assessing software quality related to genome-scale reconstruction, which we expect to be useful for the potential users of these tools. Subsequently, we used the feature list to evaluate the performance of each tool. In order to assess the similarity of the draft reconstructions to high-quality models, we compared each tools output networks with that of the high-quality, manually curated, models of Lactobacillus plantarum and Bordetella pertussis, representatives of gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively. We showed that none of the tools outperforms the others in all the defined features and that model builders should carefully choose a tool (or combinations of tools) depending on the intended use of the metabolic model.

During cell migration, dynamics are governed by the bidirectional interplay between cell-generated mechanical forces and the activity of Rho GTPases, a family of small GTP-binding proteins that regulate actin cytoskeleton assembly and cellular contractility. These interactions are inherently more complex during the collective migration of mechanically coupled cells, due to the additional regulation of cell-cell junctional forces. In this study, we present a minimal modeling framework to simulate the interactions between mechanochemical signaling in individual cells and interactions with cell-cell junctional forces during collective cell migration. We find that migration of individual cells depends on the feedback between mechanical tension and Rho GTPase activity in a biphasic manner. During collective cell migration, waves of Rho GTPase activity mediate mechanical contraction/extension and thus synchronization throughout the tissue. Further, cell-cell junctional forces exhibit distinct spatial patterns during collective cell migration, with larger forces near the leading edge. Larger junctional force magnitudes are associated with faster collective cell migration and larger tissue size. Simulations of heterogeneous tissue migration exhibit a complex dependence on the properties of both leading and trailing cells.

In this context, recent theoretical studies suggest that an environment containing both resources and toxic waste can promote the emergence of complex, spatially distributed proto-organisms exhibiting division of labor and higher-scale features beyond the cell-cell pairwise interactions. Some previous non-spatial models suggest that the presence of a growth inhibitor can trigger the coexistence of competitive species in an antibiotic-resistance context. In this paper we further explore this idea using both mathematical and computational models taking the most fundamental features of the proto-organisms interactions.

This indicates that the strong association between paralogs, specifically ohnologs, and dominant disorders is often a consequence of a mechanism through which pre-existing dosage sensitive/haploinsufficient genes are successfully duplicated and retained.

Success of extinction programs now rests on the possibility of resistance evolution, which is largely unknown. For CRISPR technology, resistance may take many forms, from mutations in the nuclease target sequence to specific types of non-random population structures that limit the drive. We develop mathematical models of various deviations from random mating to consider escapes from extinction-causing gene drives. We use a version of Maynard Smiths haystack model to show that population structure can enable drive-free subpopulations to be maintained against gene drives. Our main emphasis, however, is sib mating in the face of recessive-lethal and Y-chromosome drives. Sib mating easily evolves in response to both kinds of gene drives and maintains mean fitness above 0, with equilibrium fitness depending on the level of inbreeding depression. Environmental determination of sib mating (as might stem from population density crashes) can also maintain mean fitness above 0. Translation of mean fitness into population size depends on ecological details, so understanding mean fitness evolution and dynamics is merely the first step in predicting extinction.

Diffusion MRI-based tractography is being used increasingly to segment white matter tracts as regions-of-interest for subsequent quantitative analysis. Since MS lesions can interrupt the tractography algorithms tract reconstruction, clinical studies frequently resort to atlas-based approaches, which are convenient but ignorant to individual variability in tract size and shape. Here, we revisit the problem of individual tractography in MS, comparing tractography algorithms using: (i) The diffusion tensor framework; (ii) constrained spherical deconvoution (CSD); and (iii) damped Richardson-Lucy (dRL) deconvolution. Firstly, using simulated and in vivo data from 29 MS patients and 19 healthy controls, we show that the three tracking algorithms respond differentially to MS pathology. While the tensor-based approach is unable to deal with crossing fibres, CSD produces spurious stream-lines, in particular in tissue with high fibre loss and low diffusion anisotropy. With dRL, streamlines are increasingly interrupted in pathological tissue. Secondly, we demonstrate that despite the effects of lesion on the fibre orientation reconstruction algorithms, fibre tracking algorithms are still able to segment tracts that pass areas with high prevalence of lesions. Combining dRL-based tractography with an automated tract segmentation tool on data from 131 MS patients, the corticospinal tracts and arcuate fasciculi were successfully reconstructed in more than 90% of individuals. Comparing tractspecific microstructural parameters (fractional anisotropy, radial diffusivity and magnetisation transfer ratio) in individually segmented tracts to those from a tract probability map, we showed that there is no systematic disease-related bias in the individually reconstructed tracts, suggesting that lesions and otherwise damaged parts are not systematically omitted during tractography. Thirdly, we demonstrate modest anatomical correspondence between the individual and tract probability-based approach, with a spatial overlap between 35 and 55%. Correlations between tract-averaged microstructural parameters in individually segmented tracts and the probability-map approach ranged between r = .52 (p < .001) for radial diffusivity in the right cortico-spinal tract and r = .97 (p < .001) for magnetization transfer ratio in the arcuate fasciculi. Our results show that MS white matter lesions impact fibre orientation reconstructions but this does not appear to hinder the ability to anatomically localise white matter tracts in MS.

Asparagine endopeptidase (AEP) activity in particular has been associated with tau dysfunction and aggregation, and the activity of the protease is increased in both aging and AD.

Methods and ResultsUsing a mass spectrometry approach we identified a novel tau cleavage site at N167 and confirmed its processing by AEP. In combination with the previously known site at N368, we show that AEP cleavage yields a tau fragment that is present in both control and AD brains at similar levels. AEP is a lysosomal enzyme, and our data suggest that it is expressed in microglia rather than in neurons. Accordingly, we observe tau cleavage at N167 and N368 after endocytotic uptake into microglia, but not neurons. However, tau168-368 does not accumulate in microglia and we thus conclude that the fragment is part of a proteolytic cascade leading to tau degradation.

ConclusionsWhile we confirm previous studies showing increased overall AEP activity in AD brains, our data suggests that AEP-mediated cleavage of tau is a physiological event occurring during microglial degradation of the secreted neuronal protein. The disease-associated increase in active AEP may thus be related to pro-inflammatory conditions in AD brains, and our findings argue against AEP inhibition as a therapeutic approach in AD.",1,762,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/560110v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/560110v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_560110.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, the frequency and nature of these mutations at the intra-molecular level is poorly understood. To address this, we analysed the impact of protein architecture on the rate of adaptive substitutions, aiming to understand how protein biophysics influences fitness and adaptation. Using Drosophila melanogaster and Arabidopsis thaliana population genomics data, we fitted models of distribution of fitness effects and estimated the rate of adaptive amino-acid substitutions both at the protein and amino-acid residue level. We performed a comprehensive analysis covering genome, gene and protein structure, by exploring a multitude of factors with a plausible impact on the rate of adaptive evolution, such as intron number, protein length, secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, intrinsic protein disorder, chaperone affinity, gene expression, protein function and protein-protein interactions. We found that the relative solvent accessibility is a major driver of adaptive evolution, with most adaptive mutations occurring at the surface of proteins. Moreover, we observe that the rate of adaptive substitutions differs between protein functional classes, with genes encoding for protein biosynthesis and degradation signalling exhibiting the fastest rates of protein adaptation. Overall, our results suggest that adaptive evolution in proteins is mainly driven by inter-molecular interactions, with host-pathogen coevolution likely playing a major role.",1,731,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/560185v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/560185v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_560185.txt,1,supplement,1,file s1 includes the raw data,for this purpose we discarded 1% in the maximum and minimum values for the mean and shape parameters of the dfe (see supplementary files for detailed r scripts).

Here, we asked how a few minutes of (multi)sensory training could shape cortical interactions in a subsequent perceptual task, and investigated oscillatory activity and functional connectivity as a function of sensory history in training. Human participants performed a visual motion coherence discrimination task while being recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG). Three groups of participants performed the same task with visual stimuli only, while listening to acoustic textures temporally comodulated with the strength of visual motion coherence, or with auditory noise uncorrelated with visual motion. The functional connectivity patterns before and after training were contrasted to resting-state networks to assess the variability of common task-relevant networks, and the emergence of new functional inter-actions following training.

The limited availability of clinical treatment options could be a result of poor predictions in early stage drug screens on standard tissue culture polystyrene (TCPS). TCPS does not capture the mechanical and biochemical cues that cells experience in vivo, which can impact how cells will respond to a drug. Therefore, an in vitro model that captures some of the microenvironment features that the cells experience in vivo could provide better insights into drug response. In this study, we formed 3D multicellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) in microwells, and encapsulated them in 3D omentum-inspired hydrogels. SKOV-3 MCTS were resistant to Paclitaxel in our 3D hydrogels compared to a monolayer on TCPS. Toward clinical application, we tested cells from patients (ovarian carcinoma ascites spheroids (OCAS)), and drug responses predicted by using the 3D omentum-inspired hydrogels correlated with the reported pathology reports of those same patients. Additionally, we observed the presence of collagen production around the encapsulated SKOV-3 MCTS, but not on TCPS.

These genome rearrangements, or structural variants, can be detected in tumor DNA sequencing data by abnormal mapping of se-quence reads to the reference genome. However, nearly all cancer sequencing to date is of bulk tumor samples which consist of a heterogeneous mixture of normal cells and subpopulations of cancers cells, or clones, that harbor distinct somatic structural variants. We introduce a novel algorithm, Reconstructing Cancer Karyotypes (RCK), to reconstruct haplotype-specific karyotypes of one or more rearranged cancer genomes, or clones, that best explain the read alignments from a bulk tumor sample. RCK leverages specific evolutionary constraints on the somatic mutation process in cancer to reduce ambiguity in the deconvolution of admixed DNA sequence data into multiple haplotype-specific cancer karyotypes. In particular, RCK relies on generalizations of the infinite sites assumption that a genome re-arrangement is highly unlikely to occur at the same nucleotide position more than once during somatic evolution. RCKs comprehensive model allows us to incorporate information both from short and long-read sequencing technologies and is applicable to bulk tumor samples containing a mixture of an arbitrary number of derived genomes. We compared RCK to the state-of-the-art method ReMixT on a dataset of 17 primary and metastatic prostate cancer samples. We demonstrate that ReMixTs limited support for heterogeneity and lack of evolutionary constrains leads to reconstruction of implausible karyotypes. In contrast, RCKs infers cancer karyotypes that better explain read alignments from bulk tumor samples and are consistent with a reasonable evolutionary model. RCKs reconstructions of clone- and haplotype-specific karyotypes will aid further studies of the role of intra-tumor heterogeneity in cancer development and response to treatment.

Herein, we adapted the current culture systems to cells seeded on microporous biomaterials, with the hypothesis that the pores can guide the assembly into {beta}-cell clusters of defined size that can enhance maturation. The microporous scaffold culture allows hPSC-derived pancreatic progenitors to form clusters at a consistent size as cells undergo differentiation to immature {beta}-cells. By modulating the scaffold pore sizes, we observed 250-425 {micro}m pore size scaffolds significantly enhance insulin expression and key {beta}-cell maturation markers compared to suspension cultures. Furthermore, when compared to suspension cultures, the scaffold culture showed increased insulin secretion in response to glucose stimulus indicating the development of functional {beta}-cells. In addition, scaffolds facilitated cell-cell interactions enabled by the scaffold design and cell-mediated matrix deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins associated with the basement membrane of islet cells. We further investigated the influence of ECM on cell development by incorporating an ECM matrix on the scaffold prior to cell seeding; however, their presence did not further enhance maturation. These results suggest the microporous scaffold culture facilitates 3D cluster formation, supports cell-cell interactions, and provides a matrix similar to a basement membrane to drive in vitro hPSC-derived {beta}-cell maturation and demonstrates the feasibility of these scaffolds as a biomanufacturing platform.",0,712,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/560979v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/560979v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_560979.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Progress is hampered by an incomplete understanding of the immune mechanisms that protect against infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of TB1. Over 90% of people who become infected with Mtb mount an immune response that contains the bacteria indefinitely, leading to a state known as ""latent TB infection"" (LTBI)2. A significant body of epidemiologic evidence indicates that LTBI protects against active TB after re-exposure, offering an intriguing avenue to identifying protective mechanisms3, 4. We show that in a mouse model, LTBI is highly protective against infection with Mtb for up to 100 days following aerosol challenge. LTBI mice are also protected against heterologous bacterial challenge (Listeria monocytogenes) and disseminated melanoma suggesting that protection is in part mediated by alterations in the activation state of the innate immune system. Protection is associated with elevated activation of alveolar macrophages (AM), the first cells that respond to inhaled Mtb, and accelerated recruitment of Mtb-specific T cells to the lung parenchyma upon aerosol challenge. Systems approaches, including transcriptome analysis of both naive and infected AMs, as well as ex vivo functional assays, demonstrate that LTBI reconfigures the response of tissue resident AMs.. Furthermore, we demonstrate that both LTBI mice and latently infected humans show similar alterations in the relative proportions of circulating innate immune cells, suggesting that the same cellular changes observed in the LTBI mouse model are also occurring in humans.

Two models describe the relationship between disulfide formation and folding, the folded precursor model, in which formation of nascent structure occurs prior to the disulfides and the quasi-stochastic model where disulfides form prior to complete domain folding. Here we investigate oxidative folding within a cellular milieu of three structurally diverse substrates in order to understand the folding mechanisms required to achieve correct cysteine coupling. We use a eukaryotic translation system in which we can manipulate the redox conditions and produce stalled translation intermediates representative of different stages of translocation. We identify different disulfide bonded isomers by non-reducing SDS-PAGE. Using this approach, we determined whether each substrate followed a folding driven or disulfide driven mechanism. Our results demonstrate that the folding model is substrate-dependent with disulfides forming prior to complete domain folding in a cysteine-rich domain lacking secondary structure, whereas disulfide formation was absent in proteins with defined structural elements. In addition, we demonstrate the presence and rearrangement of non-native disulfides specifically in substrates following the quasi-stochastic model. These findings demonstrate why non-native disulfides are prevented from forming in proteins with well-defined secondary structure.

Significance statementA third of human proteins contain structural elements called disulfide bonds that are often crucial for stability and function. Disulfides form between cysteines in the specialised environment of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), during the complex process of protein folding. Many proteins contain multiple cysteines that can potentially form correct or incorrect cysteine pairings. To investigate how correct disulfide pairs are formed in a biological context, we developed an experimental approach to assess disulfide formation and rearrangement as proteins enter the ER. We found that a disulfide-dense protein domain with atypical secondary structure undergoes disulfide orchestrated folding as it enters the ER and is prone to incorrect disulfide formation. In contrast, proteins with defined secondary structure form folding dependent, native disulfides. These findings show how different mechanisms of disulfide formation can be rationalised from structural features of the folding domains.",1,59,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/564740v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/564740v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_564740.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

High incidence of antibiotic resistant bacteria and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in solid organic waste necessitates the development of effective treatment strategies. The objective of this study was to assess ARG diversity and abundance as well as the relationship between resistome and microbial community structure during anaerobic co-digestion (AD) of food waste, paper and cardboard. A lab-scale solid-state AD system consisting of six sequentially fed leach beds (each with a solids retention time of 42 days) and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor was operated under mesophilic conditions continuously for 88 weeks to successfully treat municipal organic waste and produce biogas. A total of ten samples from digester feed and digestion products were collected for microbial community analysis including SSU rRNA gene sequencing, total community metagenome sequencing and quantitative PCR. Taxonomic analyses revealed that AD changed the taxonomic profile of the microbial community: digester feed was dominated by bacterial and eukaryotic taxa while anaerobic digestate possessed a large proportion of archaea mainly belonging to the methanogenic genus Methanosaeta. ARGs were identified in all samples with significantly higher richness and relative abundance per 16S rRNA gene in digester feed compared to digestion products. Multidrug resistance was the most abundant ARG type. AD was not able to completely remove ARGs as shown by ARGs detected in digestion products. Using metagenomic assembly and binning we detected potential bacterial hosts of ARGs in digester feed, that included Erwinia, Bifidobacteriaceae, Lactococcus lactis and Lactobacillus.

IMPORTANCESolid organic waste is a significant source of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) (1) and effective treatment strategies are urgently required to limit the spread of antimicrobial resistance. Here we studied the antibiotic resistome and microbial community structure within an anaerobic digester treating a mixture of food waste, paper and cardboard. We observed a significant shift in microbial community composition and a reduction in ARG diversity and abundance after 6 weeks of digestion. We identified the host organisms of some of the ARGs including potentially pathogenic as well as non-pathogenic bacteria, and we detected mobile genetic elements required for horizontal gene transfer. Our results indicate that the process of sequential solid-state anaerobic digestion of food waste, paper and cardboard tested herein provides a significant reduction in the relative abundance of ARGs per 16S rRNA gene.",1,564,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/564823v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/564823v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_564823.txt,1,field-specific repository,1,sequencing data from ssu rrna gene sequencing  602  (accession numbers provided in table s1 in supplemental material) and total community  603  metagenome sequencing (accession numbers provided in table s3 in supplemental  604  material) is available on ncbi sequence read archive under bioproject prjna501900  605  sra study srp167436 accession numbers srx4965138–47 (ssu rrna gene  606  sequencing) and srx4986160–6 (total community metagenome sequencing).,it is made available under acc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license.  965  from assembled contigs taxonomic annotation of assembled contigs (tool 3.9) binning of  966  the assembled contigs into metagenome assembled genomes (tools 3.11 3.12 3.13) and  967  detection of args in metagenome assembled genomes by a local python script (tool  968  3.14). contigs with multiple  589  args were identified by a local python script that counted how many times a contig id  590  appeared in the list of contigs that carried args (method s1 in supplemental material).

At the nano-scale these metals are of even higher value due to their catalytic abilities for industrial applications. Desulfovibrio alaskensis is able to capture ionic forms of both of these metals, reduce them, and synthesize elemental nanoparticles. Despite this ability very little is known about the biological pathways involved in the formation of these nanoparticles. Proteomic analysis of D. alaskensis in response to platinum and palladium has highlighted those proteins involved in both the reductive pathways and the wider stress-response system. A core set of 13 proteins was found in both treatments and consisted of proteins involved in metal transport and reduction. There were also 7 proteins specific to either platinum or palladium. Over-expression of one of these platinum-specific genes, a NiFe hydrogenase small subunit (Dde_2137), resulted in the formation of larger nanoparticles. This study improves our understanding of the pathways involved in the metal resistance mechanism of Desulfovibrio and informs how we can tailor the bacterium for nanoparticle production, enhancing its application as a bioremediation tool and as way to capture contaminant metals from the environment.

ImportanceBacteria, in particularly D. alaskensis, represent a biological and greener way to capture high value metals such as platinum group metals from environmental and industrial waste streams. The recovery of these metals in nanoparticle forms adds extra value to this process as they can be used in a variety of different industrial applications as they have exceptional catalytic capabilities. D. alaskensis ability to do this, has been widely reported, though very little is understood about the underlying protein and genetic components.

Small molecule drugs known as capsid inhibitors (CIs) impede the highly-regulated activity of CA. Intriguingly, a few CIs, such as PF-3450074 (PF74) and GS-CA1, exhibit effects at multiple stages of the viral lifecycle at effective concentrations in the pM to nM regimes, while the majority of CIs target a single stage of the viral lifecycle and are effective at nM to {micro}M concentrations. In this work, we use coarse-grained (CG) molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that enable CIs to have such curious broad-spectrum activity. Our quantitatively analyzed findings show that CIs can have a profound impact on the hierarchical self-assembly of CA by perturbing the population of small CA oligomers. The self-assembly process is accelerated by the emergence of alternative assembly pathways that favor the rapid incorporation of CA pentamers, and leads to increased structural pleomorphism of mature capsids. Two relevant phenotypes are observed: (1) eccentric capsid formation that may fail to encase the viral genome and (2) rapid disassembly of the capsid, which express at late and early stages of infection, respectively.

In practice, a visual inspection of the signals is still required, which is impractical with large datasets. Avant-garde is a new tool to refine DIA (and PRM) by removing interfered transitions, adjusting integration boundaries and scoring peaks to control the FDR. Unlike other tools where MS runs are scored independently from each other, Avant-garde uses a novel data-driven scoring strategy. DIA signals are refined by learning from the data itself, using all measurements in all samples together to achieve the best optimization. We evaluated the performances of Avant-garde with a calibrated sample using spiked-in standards in a complex background, a phospho-enriched dataset (Abelin et al, 2016), and two complex hybrid proteome samples for benchmarking DIA software tools. The results clearly showed that Avant-garde is capable of improving the selectivity, accuracy, and reproducibility of the quantification results in very complex biological matrices.

Consistent with addiction being a complex disorder, prior studies have noted many factors that predict addiction vulnerability, such as drug-induced aversive effects, behavioral responses to novelty, and sensitivity to punishment.\n\nMethodsWe tested different inbred strains of rats, as well as selectively bred Sprague-Dawley (SD) or Heterogeneous Stock (HS) rats, on cocaine avoidance, sensitivity to punishment, and locomotor responses to novelty, and calculated heritability estimates of these behaviors. We tested animals on additional control tasks (progressive ratio, shock avoidance) to control for alternate interpretations of addiction-like behaviors.\n\nResultsConditioned avoidance to cocaine varied greatly between individual rats as measured using either the runway operant task or conditioned place aversion (CPA). Cocaine avoidance responded rapidly to selective breeding, yielding heritability estimates of 0.70 and 0.58 in SD and HS rats. Resistance to punishment was also highly heritable in inbred rats (estimated h2 = 0.62), and varied independently of cocaine avoidance despite both behaviors being mediated by the RMTg. Furthermore, cocaine avoidance correlated positively with cocaine-induced c-Fos induction in the RMTg, negatively with initial rates of acquisition of intravenous cocaine self-administration, and positively with both cued and cocaine-primed reinstatement.\n\nConclusionsCocaine avoidance and resistance to punishment are strongly and independently heritable behaviors that may both control different aspects of individual propensity to acquire and maintain drug-seeking.",0,640,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/566018v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/566018v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_566018.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

For each cohort, we estimated incidence rates over a 5 year follow-up period and used Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models in order to estimate the impact of the change in policy on TB.\n\nResultsIn the non-UK born, we found evidence for an association between a reduction in incidence rates and the change in BCG policy (school-age IRR: 0.74 (95%CI 0.61, 0.88), neonatal IRR: 0.62 (95%CI 0.44, 0.88)). We found some evidence that the change in BCG policy was associated with a increase in incidence rates in the UK born school-age population (IRR: 1.08 (95%CI 0.97, 1.19)) and weaker evidence of an association with a reduction in incidence rates in UK born neonates (IRR: 0.96 (95%CI 0.82, 1.14)). Overall, we found that the change in BCG policy was associated with directly preventing 385 (95% CI -105, 881) TB cases.\n\nConclusionsWithdrawing universal vaccination at school-age and targeting BCG vaccination towards high-risk neonates was associated with reduced incidence of TB in England. This was largely driven by reductions in the non-UK born. There was a slight increase in UK born school-age cases.\n\nKey MessagesO_LIThere is little existing literature on the impact of withdrawing universal school-age BCG vaccination and introducing high-risk neonatal BCG vaccination on TB incidence rates in the populations directly affected by the vaccination programmes.\nC_LIO_LIThere was strong evidence that the change in policy was associated with a decrease in TB incidence rates in non-UK born neonates and school-age children. In the UK born individuals, there was some evidence that the change in policy was associated with an increase in TB incidence rates in those relevant to the universal school-age scheme, with little evidence of a decrease in incidence rates in those relevant to the high-risk neonatal vaccination scheme.\nC_LIO_LIOverall the change in vaccination policy was associated with preventing TB cases, mainly in the non-UK born.\nC_LIO_LIThese results provide an important evaluation of the direct effects of both withdrawing and implementing a BCG vaccination programme in a low incidence, high income, country and are relevant to several other countries that have made similar changes to their vaccination programmes.\nC_LI",1,554,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/567511v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/567511v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_567511.txt,1,"general-purpose repository, data availability statement",1,accessibility of data and programming code the code used to clean the data used in this paper can be found at: doi:10.5281/zenodo.2551555 the code for the analysis contained in this paper can be found at: doi:10.5281/zenodo.2583056  17   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/567511; this version posted march 8 2019.     accessibility of data and programming code the code used to clean the data used in this paper can be found at: doi,available from: https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3 16.

Here, we compare seed and adult plant communities at twelve grassland sites with different climates in southern Norway to explore the degree to which community membership is shaped by dispersal limitation and local niche-based filtering, and how this varies with climate. To do this, we first divide species at each site into two groups: \""locally-transient\"" species, which occur as seeds but are rare or absent as adults (i.e., they arrive but are filtered out), or \""locally-persistent\"" species, which occur consistently as adults in annual vegetation surveys. We then ask questions to reveal where, when, why, and how locally-transient species are systematically disfavored during community assembly. Our results led to four main conclusions: (1) the strength of local filtering on community membership increased with temperature, (2) surprisingly, local filtering was stronger during seedling emergence than during seedling establishment, (3) climate-based niche differences drove differential performance among species, especially for seeds dispersing outside of their realized climate niches into more stressful (colder and drier) climates, and (4) locally-transient species had traits that may made them better dispersers (smaller seeds) but poorer competitors for light (shorter statures, less persistent clonal connections) than locally-persistent species, providing a potential explanation for why they arrived to new sites but failed to establish persistent adult populations.

However, in addition to the mutations that confer a growth advantage, cancer genomes accumulate a large number of passenger somatic mutations resulting from normal DNA damage and repair processes as well as mutations triggered by carcinogenic exposures or cancer related aberrations of DNA maintenance machinery. These mutagenic processes often produce characteristic mutational patterns called mutational signatures. Understanding the etiology of the mutational signatures shaping a cancer genome is an important step towards understanding tumorigenesis. Considering mutational signatures as phenotypes, we asked two complementary questions (i) what are functional pathways whose gene expression profiles are associated with mutational signatures, and (ii) what are mutated pathways (if any) that might underlie specific mutational signatures? We have been able to identify pathways associated with mutational signatures on both expression and mutation levels. In particular, our analysis provides novel insights into mutagenic processes in breast cancer by capturing important differences in the etiology of different APOBEC related signatures and the two clock-like signatures.

A case in hand concerns roan antelope, one of Africas most iconic large mammal species. Despite their large size, these antelope are sensitive to habitat disturbance and interspecific competition, leading to the species being listed as Least Concern but with decreasing population trends, and as extinct over parts of its range. Molecular research identified the presence of two evolutionary significant units across their sub-Saharan range, corresponding to a West African lineage and a second larger group which includes animals from East, Central and Southern Africa. Within South Africa, one of the remaining bastions with increasing population sizes, there are a number of West African roan antelope populations on private farms, and concerns are that these animals hybridize with roan that naturally occur in the southern African region. We used a suite of 27 microsatellite markers to conduct admixture analysis.

A promising approach for linking changes in developmental gene expression to altered morphogenesis is the comparison of developmental transcriptomes of closely related and further diverged species within the same phylum. Here we generated quantitative transcriptomes of the sea star, Patiria miniata (P. miniata) of the echinoderm phylum, at eight embryonic stages. We then compared developmental gene expression between P. miniata and the sea urchin, Paracentrotus lividus (~500 million year divergence) and between Paracentrotus lividus and the sea urchin, Strongylocentrotus purpuratus (~40 million year divergence). We discovered that the interspecies correlations of gene expression level between morphologically equivalent stages decreases with increasing evolutionary distance, and becomes more similar to the correlations between morphologically distinct stages. This trend is observed for different sub-sets of genes, from various functional classes and embryonic territories, but is least severe for developmental genes sub-sets. The interspecies correlation matrices of developmental genes show a consistent peak at the onset of gastrulation, supporting the hourglass model of phylotypic stage conservation. We propose that at large evolutionary distance the conservation of relative expression levels for most sets of genes is more related to the required quantities of transcripts in a cell than to conserved morphogenesis processes. In these distances, the information about morphological similarity is reflected mostly in the interspecies correlations between the expressions of developmental control genes.\n\nAuthor summaryUnderstanding the relationship between the interspecies conservation of gene expression and morphological similarity is a major challenge in modern evolutionary and developmental biology. The Interspecies correlations of gene expression levels have been used extensively to illuminate these relationships and reveal the developmental stages that show the highest conservation of gene expression, focusing on the diagonal elements of the correlation matrices. Here we generated the developmental transcriptomes of the sea star, Patiria miniata, and used them to study the interspecies correlations between closely related and further diverged species within the echinoderm phylum. Our study reveals that the diagonal elements of the correlation matrices contain only partial information. The off-diagonal elements, that compare gene expression between distinct developmental stages, indicate whether the conservation of gene expression is indeed related to similar morphology or instead, to general cellular constraints that linger throughout development. With increasing evolutionary distances the diagonal elements decrease and become similar to the off-diagonal elements, reflecting the shift from morphological to general cellular constraints. Within this trend, the interspecies correlations of developmental control genes maintain their diagonality even at large evolutionary distance, and peak at the onset of gastrulation, supporting the hourglass model of phylotypic stage conservation.",1,754,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/573741v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/573741v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_573741.txt,1,"field-specific repository, data availability statement",0,352  p. miniata data availability: illumina short read sequences generated in this study was submitted  353  to the ncbi sequence read archive (sra) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under bio-project  354  prjna522463  355  srr8580044 - srr8580066 assembled p. miniara transcriptome accession: samn10967027.      data availability: illumina short read sequences generated in this study was submitted  353  to the ncbi sequence read archive (sra) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) under bio-project  354  prjna522463,NA

Larvae of both the species fed on host plant leaves that were either chemically sterilized or treated with antibiotics had significantly reduced bacterial loads and disrupted gut bacterial communities substantially. However, neither host species treated this way suffered a significant fitness cost. We did not find significant variation in survival, growth and development between test larvae and control larvae.

We generated new monoclonal antibodies that recognize the M. tuberculosis secreted protein, Ag85B, and used them to establish and characterize a sensitive ELISA to quantitate Ag85B in samples generated in vitro and in vivo. We found that nutritional or culture conditions had little impact on secretion of Ag85B, and that there is considerable variation in Ag85B secretion by distinct strains in the M. tuberculosis complex: compared with the commonly-used H37Rv strain (Lineage 4), M. africanum (Lineage 6) secretes less, and two strains from Lineage 2 secrete more Ag85B. We also used the ELISA to determine that the rate of secretion of Ag85B is 10-to 100-fold lower than that of proteins secreted by gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria, respectively. ELISA quantitation of Ag85B in lung homogenates of M. tuberculosis H37Rv-infected mice revealed that although Ag85B accumulates in the lungs as the bacterial population expands, the amount of Ag85B per bacterium decreases nearly 10,000-fold at later stages of infection, coincident with development of T cell responses and arrest of bacterial population growth. These results indicate that bacterial protein secretion in vivo is dynamic and regulated, and quantitation of secreted bacterial proteins can contribute to understanding pathogenesis and immunity in tuberculosis and other infections.

ImportanceBacterial protein secretion contributes to host-pathogen interactions, yet the process and consequences of bacterial protein secretion during infection are poorly understood. We developed a sensitive ELISA to quantitate a protein (termed Ag85B) secreted by M. tuberculosis and used it to find that Ag85B secretion occurs with slower kinetics than for proteins secreted by gram positive and gram negative bacteria, and that accumulation of Ag85B in the lungs is markedly regulated as a function of the bacterial population density.

Extensive research efforts are geared, through pharmacological approach, towards preventing or reversing this. Erythrina abyssinica Lam ex DC is an indigenous tree used widely used in traditional medicine, including for the treatment of liver related diseases, and has been shown to possess hypoglycemic, anti-oxidant, antimicrobial and anti-plasmodia effects. The present study is aimed at establishing the effects of E. abyssinica on the development of Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease induced by a high-fat and high-sugar diet in rats, in-vivo model.\n\nMethodsForty rats (40) were randomly divided into five groups: positive control (pioglitazone), Negative control (high fat/high sugar diet), low test dose (200 mg/kg), high test dose (400 mg/kg) and normal group (standard chow pellets and fresh water).\n\nThe inhibitory effect of the stem bark extract of E. abyssinica on the development of NAFLD was evaluated by chronic administration the herb extracts to rats on a high-fat/high-sugar diet. Biochemical indices of hepatic function including serum lipid profile, serum aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels were then determined. Histological analysis of liver samples was carried out to quantify the degree of steato-hepatitis. Liver weights were taken and used to determine the hepatic index. The data was analyzed using one-way ANOVA, and Tukeys post-hoc tests were done in cases of significance. Histology data was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Dunns post-hoc test was done in cases of significance. Significance was set at p<0.05.\n\nResultsThe freeze dried extract of E. abyssinica had significant effects on fasting blood glucose [5.43 {+/-} 0.17 (HF/HSD) vs 3.8 {+/-} 0.15 (E 400 mg/kg) vs 4.54 {+/-} 0.09 (E 200 mg/kg) vs. 4.16 {+/-} 0.13 (PIOG) vs. 2.91 {+/-} 0.16 (normal control): P value < 0.0001], and insulin sensitivity [329.4 {+/-} 13.48 mmol/L {middle dot} min (HF/HSD) vs. 189.8 {+/-} 12.11 mmol/L {middle dot} min (E 400 mg/kg) vs. 233.8 {+/-} 6.55 mmol/L{middle dot} min (E 200 mg/kg) vs. 211.1 {+/-} 7.35 mmol/L {middle dot} min (PIOG) vs. 142.9 {+/-} 11.94 mmol/L {middle dot} min: P value < 0.0001],\n\nThe extract had significant effects on hepatic indices including, hepatic triglycerides (P value < 0.0001), liver weights (P value < 0.0001), liver weight-body weight ratio (P value < 0.0001), serum ALT levels (P value < 0.0001), serum AST (P value < 0.0017), serum total cholesterol (P value < 0.0001), serum triglycerides (P value < 0.0001), and serum LDL-cholesterol (P value < 0.0001).

Infected plants lose tissue integrity and functional immunity as a result, exposing the nutrient rich, decayed tissues to the environment. One challenge for the necrotrophs to successfully cause secondary infection (infection spread from an initially infected plant to the nearby uninfected plants) is to effectively utilize nutrients released from hosts towards building up a large population before other saprophytes come. In this study, we observed that the necrotrophic pathogen Dickeya dadantii exhibited heterogeneity in bacterial cell length in an isogenic population during infection of potato tuber. While some cells were regular rod-shape (<10m), the rest elongated into filamentous cells (>10m). Short cells tended to occur at the interface of healthy and diseased tissues, during the early stage of infection when active attacking and killing is occurring, while filamentous cells tended to form when large amount of nutrients were released at a later stage of infection. Short cells expressed all necessary virulence factors and motility, whereas filamentous cells did not engage in virulence, were non-mobile and more sensitive to environmental stress. However, compared to the short cells, the filamentous cells displayed elevated metabolism and faster growth, which may benefit the pathogens to build up a large population necessary for the secondary infection. The segregation of the two subpopulations was dependent on differential expression of the alarmone guanosine tetraphosphate (ppGpp). When exposed to fresh tuber tissues or freestanding water, filamentous cells quickly transformed to short virulent cells.

Mutations may also affect miRNA biogenesis by changing the structure of miRNA precursors, DROSHA and DICER cleavage sites, and regulatory sequence/structure motifs. We identified 10 significantly overmutated hotspot miRNA genes, including the miR-379 gene in LUAD enriched in mutations in the mature miRNA and regulatory sequences.

We present a simple model of a quadruped that can spontaneously produce any of the 2300+ planar footfall sequences available to quadrupeds. Through trajectory optimization of a work and force-rate cost, and a large sample of random initial guesses, we provide stronger evidence towards the global optimality of symmetrical four-beat walking at low speeds and two beat running (trotting) at intermediate speeds. Using input parameters based on measurements in dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), the model predicts the correct phase offset in walking and a realistic walk-trot transition speed. It also spontaneously reproduces the double-hump ground reaction force profile observed in walking, and the smooth single-hump profile observed in trotting, despite the models lack of springs. However, the model incorrectly predicts duty factor at the slowest speeds, and does not choose galloping as globally optimal at high speeds. These limitations might point to missing levels of complexity that could be added to future quadrupedal models, but the present results suggest that massive legs, elastic components, head-neck oscillations and even multi-linked legs are not critical determiners for the optimality of natural quadrupedal walking and trotting.\n\nAuthor summaryWhy do quadrupedal mammals move in consistent ways, when so many options are available? We tackled this problem by determining energetically-optimal gaits using a simple computational model of a four-legged animal. The model can use virtually any pattern of movement (physics-permitting!) but selects natural movement strategies as energetically optimal. The similarities between the computer-based predictions and natural animal movement are striking, and suggest mammals utilize movement strategies that optimize energy use when they move.",0,168,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/580779v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/580779v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_580779.txt,1,data availability statement,0,data availability  328  data supporting this work is available as supplemental files using a comma-delimited  329  format.  330  14/45   biorxiv preprint doi,NA

The survey also outlines to what extent researchers are occupied with reproducing experiments themselves. Currently, there is an increasing range of tools that attempt to address the production of reproducible research by making code, data, and analyses available to the community for reuse. We wanted to collect information about attitudes around the consumer end of the spectrum, where life scientists interact with research outputs to interpret scientific results. Static plots and figures within articles are a central part of this interpretation, and therefore we asked respondents to consider various features for an interactive figure within a research article that would allow them to better understand and reproduce a published analysis. The majority (91%) of respondents reported that when authors describe their research methodology (methods and analyses) in detail, published research can become more reproducible. The respondents believe that having interactive figures in published papers is a beneficial element to themselves, the papers they read as well as to their readers.

Mycolic acids are synthesized in the cytoplasm and are thought to be transported to the cell wall as a trehalose ester by the MmpL3 transporter, an antibiotic target for M. tuberculosis. However, the mechanism by which mycolate synthesis is coupled to transport, and the full MmpL3 transport machinery, is unknown. Here we identify two new components of the MmpL3 transport machinery in mycobacteria. The protein encoded by MSMEG_0736/Rv0383c is essential for growth of M. smegmatis and M. tuberculosis, is anchored to the cytoplasmic membrane, physically interacts with and colocalizes with MmpL3 in growing cells, and is required for trehalose monomycolate transport to the cell wall. In light of these findings we propose Msmeg_0736/Rv0383c be named \""TMM transport factor A\"", TtfA. The protein encoded by MSMEG_5308 also interacts with the MmpL3 complex, but is nonessential for growth or TMM transport. However, MSMEG_5308 accumulates with inhibition of MmpL3 mediated TMM transport and stabilizes the MmpL3/TtfA complex, indicating that it stabilizes the transport system during stress.

Both evolutionary dynamics and the identities of mutations differed between lifestyle. Planktonic populations experienced selective sweeps of mutations including the primary topoisomerase drug targets, whereas biofilm-adapted populations acquired mutations in regulators of efflux pumps.

Its symptom burden is pervasive, persistent and associated with poor rehabilitation outcomes, though its mechanisms are poorly understood. Many patients with PSF experience cognitive difficulties, but studies aiming to identify cognitive correlates of PSF have been largely inconclusive. In contrast to conventional neuropsychological assessment, computational modeling of behavioral data allows for a dissection of specific cognitive processes associated with group or individual differences in fatigue. With the aim to zero in on the cognitive phenotype of PSF, we fitted a hierarchical drift diffusion model (hDDM) to response time data from Attention Network Test (ANT) obtained from 53 chronic stroke patients. The computational model accurately reconstructed the individual level response time distributions in the different ANT conditions, and hDDM regressions identified an interaction between trial number and fatigue symptoms on non-decision time, intuitively indicating that the cognitive phenotype of fatigue entails an increased vulnerability to sustained attentional effort. These novel results demonstrate the significance of considering the sustained nature of cognitive effort when defining the cognitive phenotype of post-stroke fatigue, and suggest that the use of computational approaches offers a further characterization of the specific processes underlying observed behavioral differences.",0,290,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/582502v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/582502v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_582502.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Sequencing can be used to obtain genotypes but does not provide unambiguous genotype calls, especially when sequencing depth is low in order to reduce costs. In that case, standard parentage analysis methods no longer apply. A strategy for using low-depth sequencing data for parentage assignment is developed here. It entails the use of relatedness estimates along with a metric termed excess mismatch rate which, for parent-offspring pairs or trios, is the difference between the observed mismatch rate and the rate expected under a model of inheritance and allele reads without error. When more than one putative parent has similar statistics, bootstrapping can provide a measure of the relatedness similarity. Putative parent-offspring trios can be further checked for consistency by comparing the offsprings estimated inbreeding to half the parent relatedness. Suitable thresholds are required for each metric. These methods were applied to a deer breeding operation consisting of two herds of different breeds. Relatedness estimates were more in line with expectation when the herds were analysed separately than when combined, although this did not alter which parents were the best matches with each offspring. Parentage results were largely consistent with those based on a microsatellite parentage panel with three discordant parent assignments out of 1561.

Here, we scale modeling processes from gene expression through photosynthetic metabolism to predict leaf physiology in evaluating acclimation of photosynthesis to rising [CO2]. Model integration with the yggdrasil interface enabled asynchronous message passing between models. The multiscale model of soybean photosynthesis calibrated to physiological measures at ambient [CO2] successfully predicted the acclimatory changes in the photosynthetic apparatus that were observed at 550 ppm [CO2] in the field. We hypothesized that genetic alteration is necessary to achieve optimal photosynthetic efficiency under global change. Flux control analysis in the metabolic system under elevated [CO2] identified enzymes requiring the greatest change to adapt optimally to the new conditions. This predicted that Rubisco was less limiting under elevated [CO2] and should be down-regulated allowing re-allocation of resource to enzymes controlling the rate of regeneration of ribulose-1:5 bisphosphate (RubP). By linking the GRN through protein concentration to the metabolic model it was possible to identify transcription factors (TF) that matched the up- and down-regulation of genes needed to improve photosynthesis. Most striking was TF GmGATA2, which down-regulated genes for Rubisco synthesis while up-regulating key genes controlling RubP regeneration and starch synthesis. The changes predicted for this TF most closely matched the physiological ideotype that the modeling predicted as optimal for the future elevated [CO2] world.",1,265,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/582981v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/582981v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_582981.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

These sources include errors in the presynaptic inputs to the neurons, noise in synaptic transmission, and fluctuations in the neurons postsynaptic potentials. Collectively they lead to errors in the neurons outputs which are, in turn, injected into the network. Does unreliable network activity hinder fundamental functions of the brain, such as learning and memory retrieval? To explore this question, this article examines the effects of errors and noise on properties of biologically constrained networks of inhibitory and excitatory neurons involved in associative sequence learning. The associative learning problem is solved analytically and numerically, and it is also shown how memory sequences can be loaded into the network with a more biologically plausible perceptron-type learning rule. Interestingly, the results reveal that errors and noise during learning increase the probability of memory recall. There is a tradeoff between the capacity and reliability of stored memories, and, noise during learning is required for optimal retrieval of stored information. What is more, networks loaded with associative memories to capacity display many structural and dynamical features observed in local cortical circuits. Due to the similarities between the associative and brain networks, this article predicts that the connections originating from unreliable inhibitory and excitatory neurons or neuron classes in the cortex must be depressed or eliminated during learning, while the connections onto noisy neurons or neuron classes must have lower probabilities and higher weights.",1,432,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/583922v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/583922v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_583922.txt,0,NA,1,NA,this system contains six latent variables u  x    y  and z which determine the critical capacity of the neuron  c : (1  f ) f u  f f u  0    out    out   4  u  u  f out e  u   (1  f out ) e  u  x  2   f out f  u   (1  f out ) f  u   dout  dout    1 n    2 zaj g j  y  syn aj  cj     2 wy  f   2 cj  n j 1 c j x  b j     1 n aj g j c j    2 za g  y  a  j j syn j   2y f      n c x  b 2 c 1 j  j j j     2 b     2 za g  y  a 1 n cj u  u    j j j syn j    cj  d  2 2     2 cj  n j 1  c j x  b j   2  dout  dout       n  a c    2 zaj g j  y  syn aj  j  1  syn j   2 w  4 z  4 int2 y f     n j 1 c j x  b j 2 cj    u  u  0 f out d  u   (1  f out ) d  u  1 c  x 2  fout e  u   (1  fout ) e  u   n 2  c 2j  n   j 1  c x  b  j  j  2      int2 y 2  yw  2 yz       2 zaj g j  y  syn aj d  2 cj        (s22) these equations were solved in matlab to produce the results shown in figure 4 of the main text  (network  of  heterogeneous  neurons)  and  the  https://github.com/neurogeometry/associative_learning_with_noise  25  code  is  available  at   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/583922; this version posted march 21 2019.;     this code is available at https://github.com/neurogeometry/associative_learning_with_noise  memory storage and recall in an associative network of model neurons  we consider a mcculloch and pitts neural network [1] of nexc excitatory and (n - nexc) inhibitory neurons.

Basal media, feed, feeding strategy and glycan structures are always among the most important concerns during process development and optimization. In this study, first, a traditional screening study was performed to identify the top media/feed combinations by evaluating the cell culture performance including cell growth and protein titre. Optimization of the process was also performed using response surface methodology in order to find the most optimum feeding strategy and glucose set point regarding final titre of the recombinant monoclonal antibody being produced in Chinese hamster ovary cell line. The focus of this study is not only on titre, but also on product quality and comparability especially protein glycosylation. The prediction model of product titre as a function of feeding percentage and glucose set point was successfully applied for the second set of experiments that was performed for glycan improvement. Statistical design of experiments was applied to determine the most important factors and their effects on galactosylated and afucosylated glycans. Uridine, manganese, galactose and fucosyltransferase inhibitor were chosen to evaluate if their presence can affect glycans and to obtain their best combination for fed-batch culture supplementation. We determined that 2.5 % daily feeding combined with maintaining the glucose set point on 2.5{+/-}0.2 g/L could achieve final titre of 2.5{+/-} 0.1 g/L. Galactosylation of antibody was increased about 25% using MnCl2 and galactose while afucosylation was increased about 8% in presence of fucosyltransferase inhibitor. Galactose and Mn2+ led to a shift from G0F to G1F and presence of Fucosyltransferase inhibitor caused to an increase in G0 compared to its absence. These results demonstrated that supplementation of culture with all these components can provide exact control of antibody galactosylation and fucosylation with minimal impact on culture characteristics and product quality attributes. Subsequently, validation experiments were also carried out in 5L STR bioreactors which showed that similar results could be achieved in bioreactors compared to shake flasks regarding both titre and quality.",0,350,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/584144v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/584144v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_584144.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Recently, there has been a focus shift towards continuous prosthesis control, yet little is known about whether and how user adaptation affects myoelectric control performance in dexterous, intuitive tasks. We investigate the effect of short-term adaptation with independent finger position control by conducting real-time experiments with 10 able-bodied and two transradial amputee subjects. We demonstrate that despite using an intuitive decoder, experience leads to significant improvements in performance. We argue that this is due to the lack of an utterly natural control scheme, which is mainly caused by differences in the anatomy of human and artificial hands, movement intent decoding inaccuracies, and lack of proprioception.

Intriguingly, its reported Km for lactate, obtained with pH-sensitive probes, is more than an order of magnitude higher than physiological lactate. Here we examined MCT4-rich MDA-MB-231 cells using the FRET sensor Laconic and found a median Km for lactate uptake of only 1.7 mM, while parallel estimation in the same cells with a pH probe gave a Km of 27 mM. The median Km of MCT4 for lactate was 0.7 mM in MCT4-expressing HEK293 cells and 1.2 mM in human macrophages, suggesting that high substrate affinity is a robust property of the transporter. Probed with the FRET sensor Pyronic, MCT4 showed a Km for pyruvate of only 4.2 mM in MDA-MB-231 cells, as opposed to > 150 mM reported previously. We conclude that prior estimates of MCT4 affinity based on pH probes were severely biased by the confounding action of pH regulatory mechanisms.

Our lab has previously characterized a secreted P. aeruginosa peptidase, PaAP, that is highly expressed in chronic CF isolates. This leucine aminopeptidase is not only secreted solubly, it also associates with bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), structures known for their contribution to virulence mechanisms in a variety of Gram-negative species and one of the major components of the biofilm matrix. With this in mind, we hypothesized that PaAP may play a role in P. aeruginosa biofilm formation. Using a lung epithelial cell/bacterial biofilm coculture model, we show that PaAP deletion in a clinical P. aeruginosa background leads to increased early biofilm formation. We additionally found that only native vesicle-bound PaAP, as opposed to its soluble forms, could reconstitute the original PaAP-mediated inhibition phenotype, and that the PaAP-containing vesicles could disperse preformed biofilm microcolonies of Klebsiella pneumoniae, another lung pathogen.

The different diets also strongly influenced both the viral and bacterial gut community, but surprisingly the effect of vendor exceeded the effect of diet.

In Japan, as in the rest of world, the under-diagnose rate of CD is alarmingly high. Various studies have highlighted the importance of informed knowledge in the seeking behavior. Educational integrative activities, with consideration for socio-cultural factors, can help increase the knowledge of the participants. There has been no studies that analyze the difference in knowledge, before and after these educational activities. This study aimed to qualitatively and quantitatively investigate the knowledge, behavior and attitude toward CD among LA migrants in Japan and to evaluate the effectiveness of the community educational activity in increasing knowledge of CD.\n\nMethodologyThis cross-sectional study involved two questionnaires to analyze the knowledge of the LA migrant participants before and after the community activity (CA) in four cities in Japan (Oizumi, Suzuka, Hadano, and Nagoya).\n\nPrincipal FindingsA total of 75 participants were enrolled, predominantly Bolivians from hyperendemic areas. The baseline knowledge of CD was low. However, most of them were familiar with the disease although less than 10% of them had been tested for CD before. Living in Japan for more than 10 years and previously being tested for CD were the factors associated with better knowledge. The conducted CA significantly improved the knowledge of the participants. They associated the term \""Chagas\"" mostly with fear and concern. In contrast to other studies, the level of stigmatization was low. The barriers in care seeking behavior were language, migration process and difficulties to access to the healthcare system.\n\nConclusionEducational activities with integrative approach are useful to increase knowledge of CD. The activity brings the possibility to explore not only the level of knowledge, but also to reveal the experience and to understand the needs of the people at risk.\n\nAuthor SummaryThough the incident rate of Chagas disease (CD) has fallen, more than 7 million people are affected worldwide. The CD prevalence is under-estimated because just 1% of these affected people can access to the diagnosis and treatment. This situation is maintaining mainly for the lack of implication of socio-cultural factors in the interventions to decrease the burden of the disease. Educational activities with integral approach are useful to increase the knowledge of the people at risk. People that have being tested for CD before or living in Japan for more than 10 years have better knowledge about the disease, suggesting the importance of knowledge in the seeking behavior. The authors recommend the implementation of educational activities with integral approach as a strategy to improves the knowledge of Chagas disease among Latin America migrants in Japan.",0,293,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/589051v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/589051v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_589051.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Preclinical evidence shows antipsychotics can cause myocardial fibrosis and myocardial inflammation in murine models, but it is not known if this is the case in patients. We therefore set out to determine if there is evidence of cardiac fibrosis and/or inflammation using cardiac MRI in medicated patients with schizophrenia compared with matched healthy controls. 31 participants (14 patients and 17 controls) underwent cardiac MRI assessing myocardial markers of fibrosis/inflammation, indexed by native myocardial T1 time, and cardiac structure (left ventricular (LV) mass) and function (left/right ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes, stroke volumes, and ejection fractions). Participants were physically fit, and matched for age, gender, smoking, blood pressure, BMI, HbA1c, ethnicity, and physical activity. Compared with controls, native myocardial T1 was significantly longer in patients with schizophrenia (effect size, d=0.89; p=0.02). Patients had significantly lower LV mass, and lower left/right ventricular end-diastolic and stroke volumes (effect sizes, d=0.86-1.08; all p-values <0.05). There were no significant differences in left/right end-systolic volumes and ejection fractions between groups (p>0.05). These results suggest an early diffuse fibro-inflammatory myocardial process in patients that is independent of established CVD-risk factors and could contribute to the excess cardiovascular mortality associated with schizophrenia.

We also investigated whether stress-induced variations of miR-218 expression in the mPFC can be detected in blood. We find that downregulation of miR-218 in the mPFC increases susceptibility to a single session of social defeat, whereas overexpression of miR-218 selectively in mPFC pyramidal neurons promotes resilience to CSDS and prevents stress-induced morphological alterations to those neurons. After CSDS, susceptible mice have low levels of miR-218 in the blood as compared to control or resilient groups. We show further that up-and downregulation of miR-218 levels specifically in the mPFC correlates with miR-218 expression in blood.

It is necessary to understand the epidemiological characteristics of these attacks to protect the local population. This study aimed to characterize attacks of humans by vampire bats in the municipality of Sao Joao da Ponta, Para state, Brazil, from 2013 to 2015. All individuals attacked by bats who sought medical care during the study period (n=5) were identified in the Notifiable Diseases Information System (SINAN) database and answered a questionnaire about the circumstances of the attack. Using snowball sampling, seed cases identified other individuals who were attacked in the same period but did not seek medical care (n=61), totalizing 66 people attacked in the same period. The interviewees were male (92.4%), adults between 20 and 50 years old (69.6%) and had completed elementary education (86.3%). Most were rural residents (92.4%) and crab fishermen (79.3%). The interviewees (92.4%) identified the mangrove of the Mae Grande de Curuca extractive reserve as an area conducive to attacks by vampire bats, where groups of fishermen sometimes concentrate for days for crab fishing, often living in improvised dwellings without walls and covered by tarps or straw (88.8%). The wounds were single bites (71.2%) and were located on the lower limbs (93.9%). Overall, 42.4% of participants had been bitten more than four times throughout their life (range 1-23 attacks). Participants were unaware of the risk of contracting rabies by the bite (95.4%). Using Sao Joao da Ponta as a model, this study shows that bat attacks are an essentially occupational problem in the study region. Indeed, for each reported attack, there are 12.2 unreported cases. It is necessary to develop strategies to reach this population for prophylactic treatment.\n\nAuthor SummaryDifferent from which occurs worldwide in relation to rabies transmission, in Amazon region, vampire bat is involved on direct transmission of rabies virus to humans when searching for bloodmeal. It is common in the state of Para, Eastern Amazon, large areas inhabited near forests and mangroves. People living there use forest natural resources as a way of income and sustenance and these working conditions is what our study points out as an important factor for aggressions predisposition. Here this subject is shown as an occupational problem. This study also quantified for the first time underreported humans aggressions by bats in Amazon, using the snowball sampling, which valued the relationship between individuals to reach the target population. Based on these results, rabies surveillance may direct actions for prevention and health education for these individuals, including changes in notifications forms and suggesting pre-exposure prophylaxis in vaccination calendar of the Brazilian Ministry of Health for these individuals exposed to the rabies virus.",0,787,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/590083v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/590083v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_590083.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Third, Aboav-Weaires (AW) law relates the number of neighbours that a cell has to that of its direct neighbours. While the first rule can be explained with topological constraints in contiguous polygonal lattices, and the second rule (Lewis law) with the minimisation of the lateral contact surface energy, the driving forces behind the AW law have remained elusive. We now show that also the AW law emerges to minimise the lateral contact surface energy in polygonal lattices by driving cells to the most regular polygonal shape, but while Lewis law regulates the side lengths, the AW law controls the angles.

Individual cells occupy a particular transient state in the cell cycle, circadian rhythm, or during cell death. An appealing concept of pseudo-time trajectory analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing data was proposed in the software Monocle, and several methods of trajectory analysis have since been published to date. These aim to infer the ordering of cells and enable the tracing of gene expression profile trajectories in cell differentiation and reprogramming. However, the methods are restricted in terms of time structure because of the pre-specified structure of trajectories (linear, branched, tree or cyclic) which contrasts with the mixed state of single cells.\n\nHere, we propose a technique to extract underlying flows in single-cell data based on the Hodge decomposition (HD). HD is a theorem of vector fields on a manifold which guarantees that any given flow can decompose into three types of orthogonal component: gradient-flow (acyclic), curl-, and harmonic-flow (cyclic). HD is generalized on a simplicial complex (graph) and the discretized HD has only a weak assumption that the graph is directed. Therefore, in principle, HD can extract flows from any mixture of tree and cyclic time flows of observed cells. The decomposed flows provide intuitive interpretations about complex flow because of their linearity and orthogonality. Thus, each extracted flow can be focused on separately with no need to consider crosstalk.\n\nWe developed ddhodge software, which aims to model the underlying flow structure that implies unobserved time or causal relations in the hodge-podge collection of data points. We demonstrated that the mathematical framework of HD is suitable to reconstruct a sparse graph representation of diffusion process as a candidate model of differentiation while preserving the divergence of the original fully-connected graph. The preserved divergence can be used as an indicator of the source and sink cells in the observed population. A sparse graph representation of the diffusion process transforms data analysis of the non-linear structure embedded in the high-dimensional space of single-cell data into inspection of the visible flow using graph algorithms. Hence, ddhodge is a suitable toolkit to visualize, inspect, and subsequently interpret large data sets including, but not limited to, high-throughput measurements of biological data.\n\nThe beta version of ddhodge R package is available at: https://github.com/kazumits/ddhodge",0,462,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/592089v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/592089v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_592089.txt,0,NA,1,NA,the beta version of ddhodge r package is available at: https://github.com/kazumits/ddhodge  keywords hodge decomposition · single-cell rna-seq · trajectory analysis   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/592089; this version posted march 28 2019.

Metagenomics characterization of microbiomes is associated with minimal manipulation during sample processing, which includes sampling, storage, DNA isolation, library preparation and sequencing, before the raw data are obtained. Here we assess the effect of library preparation using a kit with a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) step (Nextera) and two PCR-free kits (NEXTflex and KAPA), and the effect of sequencing platform (HiSeq and NextSeq) on the description of microbial communities in pig feces and sewage. Two pig fecal samples were obtained from different farms and two sewage samples were collected as inlet water at a local wastewater treatment facility. Samples were processed to both perform DNA-isolation immediately upon arrival in the lab and after storage for 64 hours at -80{degrees}C, DNA isolation was performed in duplicate.\n\nWe find that both library preparation and sequencing platform had systematic effects on the microbial community description. The effects were at a level that made differentiating between the two pig fecal samples difficult. The sewage samples represented two very different communities and were at all times distinguishable from each other. We find that library preparation and sequencing platform introduced more variation than freezing the samples. The community changes did not seem associated with contamination during processing and distinct patterns connected specific types of organisms with a processing method, but it was difficult to generalize between samples. This highlights the need for continuous validation of the effect of sample processing in different types of samples and that all processing steps need to be considered when comparing between studies.

For this medicinally and commercially important plant, design principles of gene-regulatory and protein-protein interaction networks at sub-cellular level are largely un-characterized mainly because neither its reference assembly nor annotated genome is available though plenty of its transcriptomes have been studied. In this work, we report a tea leaf interologous PPI network (TeaLIPIN) consisting of 11,208 nodes and 1,97,820 interactions. A reference transcriptome assembly was first developed from all the 44 samples of 6 publicly available leaf transcriptomes (1,567,288,290 raw reads). By inferring the high-confidence interactions among potential proteins coded by these transcripts using known experimental information about PPIs in 14 plants, an interologous PPI network was constructed and its modular architecture was explored. Comparing this PPI network with 10,000 realisations of corresponding random networks (Erd[o]s-Renyi models) and examining over three network centrality metrics, we predict 2,931 bottleneck proteins (having p-values <0.01). 270 of these are deduced to have transcription factor domains by developing the HMM models of known plant TFs. Final transcripts were also mapped to the draft tea genome in order to search the probable loci of their origin.

Despite the importance of 3D chromatin conformation to cellular function and human health, little is known about how 3D chromatin conformation varies in the human population, or whether DNA sequence variation between individuals influences 3D chromatin conformation. To address these questions, we performed Hi-C on Lymphoblastoid Cell Lines (LCLs) from 20 individuals. We identified thousands of regions across the genome where 3D chromatin conformation varies between individuals and found that this conformational variation is often accompanied by variation in gene expression, histone modifications, and transcription factor (TF) binding. Moreover, we found that DNA sequence variation influences several features of 3D chromatin conformation including loop strength, contact insulation, contact directionality and density of local cis contacts. We mapped hundreds of Quantitative Trait Loci (QTLs) associated with 3D chromatin features and found evidence that some of these same variants are associated at modest levels with other molecular phenotypes as well as complex disease risk.

Because of the chemical complexity of herbal medicines, it is simpler to begin to conduct compatibility research based on herbs rather than component plant secondary metabolites. We have used transcriptome analysis to explore the effects and interactions of two plant extracts (Kushen and Baituling) combined in Compound Kushen Injection (CKI). Based on shared chemical compounds and in vitro cytotoxicity comparisons, we found that both the major compounds in CKI, and the cytotoxicity effects of CKI were mainly derived from the extract of Kushen (Sophorae flavescentis). We generated and analyzed transcriptome data from MDA-MB-231 cells treated with single-herb extracts or CKI and results showed that Kushen contributed to the perturbation of the majority of cytotoxicity/cancer related pathways in CKI such as cell cycle and DNA replication. We also found that Baituling (Heterosmilax yunnanensis Gagnep) could not only enhance the cytotoxic effects of Kushen in CKI, but also activate immune-related pathways. Our analyses predicted that IL-1{beta} gene expression was upregulated by Baituling in CKI and we confirmed that IL-1{beta} protein expression was increased using an ELISA assay. Altogether, these findings help to explain the rationale for combining Kushen and Baituling in CKI, and transcriptome analysis using single herb extracts is an effective method for understanding herbal compatibility in TCM.",1,691,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/592964v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/592964v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_592964.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, the resulting miniaturization limits the inter-electrode distance and the scalp area that can be covered by a single device. The concept of wireless EEG sensor networks (WESNs) attempts to overcome this limitation by placing a multitude of these mini-EEG devices at various scalp locations. We investigate whether optimizing the WESN topology can compensate for miniaturization effects in an auditory attention detection (AAD) paradigm.\n\nMethodsStarting from standard full-cap high-density EEG data, we emulate several candidate mini-EEG sensor nodes which locally collect EEG data with embedded electrodes separated by short distances. We propose a greedy group-utility based channel selection strategy to select a subset of these candidate nodes, to form a WESN. We compare the AAD performance of this WESN with the performance obtained using long-distance EEG recordings.\n\nResultsThe AAD performance using short-distance EEG measurements is comparable to using an equal number of long-distance EEG measurements if in both cases the optimal electrode positions are selected. A significant increase in performance was found when using nodes with three electrodes over nodes with two electrodes.\n\nConclusionWhen the nodes are optimally placed, WESNs do not significantly suffer from EEG miniaturization effects in the case of AAD.\n\nSignificanceWESN-like platforms allow to achieve similar AAD performance as with long-distance EEG recordings, while adhering to the stringent miniaturization constraints for ambulatory EEG.

It departs from the current method of gapped alignment, which uses a simplified binary state model of nucleotide position. In gapped alignment nucleotide positions have either no relationship (1-to-None) or else orthological relationship (1-to-1) with nucleotides in other sequences. Maximal homology alignment, however, allows additional states such as 1-to-Many and Many-to-Many, thus modeling both orthological and paralogical relationships, which together comprise the main homology types. Maximal homology alignment collects dispersed microparalogy into the same alignment columns on multiple rows, and thereby generates a two-dimensional representation of a single sequence. Sequence alignment then proceeds as the alignment of two-dimensional topological objects. The operations of producing and aligning two-dimensional auto-alignments motivate a need for tests of two-dimensional homological integrity. Here, I work out and implement basic principles for computationally testing the two dimensions of positional homology, which are inherent to biological sequences due to replication slippage and related errors. I then show that maximal homology alignment is more informative than gapped alignment in modeling the evolution of genetic sequences. In general, MHA is more suited when small insertions and deletions predominantly originate as local microparalogy.

Oral gavage is typically used for delivery of both antibiotic and bacteria. Although convenient, this method requires a moderate level of expertise, can be stressful for experimental animals, and may lead to unwanted tracheal or systemic introduction of bacteria. Here, we demonstrate a simple method for oral infection of mice using small pieces of regular mouse chow inoculated with a known number of bacteria. Mice readily ate chow pieces containing up to 108 CFU Salmonella, allowing for a wide range of infectious doses. In mice pretreated with streptomycin, infection with inoculated chow resulted in less variability in numbers of bacteria recovered from tissues compared to oral gavage, and highly consistent infections even at doses as low as 103 Salmonella. Mice not treated with streptomycin, as well as resistant Nramp1 reconstituted C57Bl/6J mice, were also readily infected using this method. In summary, we show that foodborne infection of mice by feeding with pieces of chow inoculated with Salmonella results in infection comparable to oral gavage but represents a natural route of infection with fewer side effects and less variability among mice.",1,550,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/593442v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/593442v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_593442.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here we discuss the plausibility of de novo emergence of viroid-like replicons by giving theoretical support to the likelihood of different steps along a parsimonious evolutionary pathway. While Avsunviroidae-like structures are relatively easy to obtain through evolution of a population of random RNA sequences of fixed length, rod-like structures typical of Pospiviroidae are difficult to fix. Using different quantitative approaches, we evaluate the likelihood that RNA sequences fold into a rod-like structure and bear specific sequence motifs facilitating interactions with other molecules, e.g. RNA polymerases, RNases and ligases. By means of numerical simulations, we show that circular RNA replicons analogous to Pospiviroidae emerge if evolution is seeded with minimal circular RNAs that grow through the gradual addition of nucleotides. Further, these rod-like replicons often maintain their structure if independent functional modules are acquired that impose selective constraints.

UPEC strains have high genomic diversity and encode numerous virulence factors that differentiate them from non-UTI causing strains, including ompT. As OmpT homologues cleave and inactivate AMPs, we hypothesized that high OmpT protease activity-levels contribute to UPEC colonization during symptomatic UTIs. Therefore, we measured OmpT activity in 58 UPEC clinical isolates. While heterogeneous OmpT activities were observed, OmpT activity was significantly greater in UPEC strains isolated from patients with symptomatic infections. Unexpectedly, UPEC strains exhibiting the greatest protease activities harboured an additional ompT-like gene called arlC (ompTp).

Here we aim at establishing a deeper understanding of the complex multilocus dynamics underlying such speciation transitions under resource competition. In reality, a single populations resource utilization can never exactly match a resource distribution, making residual selection pressures inevitable. We find that this commonly leads to three-phase transitions to reproductive isolation. First, partial assortativity emerges, quickly adjusting a populations variance to the resource distributions variance. Second, allelic variance slowly erodes across loci, allowing an increasingly bimodal phenotype distribution to emerge. Third, a fast transition occurs toward full bimodality in conjunction with practically complete reproductive isolation of the emerging two species. The first phase is driven by frequency-dependent divergent ecological selection. The second phase is driven by self-accelerating residual ecological selection: the more loci code for the selected phenotype, the slower is this intermediate phase. The third phase is driven by self-accelerating sexual selection. We study three types of mismatch-driven speciation, resulting from (i) incongruences between the shapes of resource distributions and competition kernels, (ii) low numbers of loci, and (iii) premature cessations of the first phases variance expansion.

However, the elevated CO2 contributed more to plant growth (1.9% ~ 7.3%) than decomposition (1.7% ~ 6.1%), which could offset the warming-induced carbon loss. The interannual and decadal-scale dynamics of the carbon fluxes in the alpine grassland were primarily controlled by temperature, while the role of precipitation became increasingly important in modulating carbon cycle. The strengthened correlation between precipitation and carbon budget suggested that further research should consider the performance of precipitation in evaluating carbon dynamics in a warmer climate scenario.",1,757,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/595926v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/595926v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_595926.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Although recognized for its role in IH-dependent changes in cardio-respiratory physiology, it remains unclear how IH-dependent HIF1a signaling affects neurophysiology underlying learning and memory. This study examines how IH affects hippocampal associated learning and memory in wildtype mice and mice heterozygous for the HIF1a gene (HIF1a+/-). In wild-type mice, ten days of IH impaired performance in the Barnes maze increased hippocampal HIF1a and elevated protein carbonyls. These behavioral and biochemical effects of IH were accompanied by a decrease in the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate receptor (NMDAr) and an attenuation of long-term potentiation (LTP) in area CA1. In HIF1a+/-, IH did not impair Barnes maze performance, increase hippocampal HIF1a, or enhance protein carbonyl content. At the network level, IH neither led to a decrease in NMDAr nor impaired LTP. Concurrent antioxidant treatment during IH mitigated the IH-dependent effects on the Barnes maze performance and LTP in wildtype mice. Our findings indicate that IH-dependent HIF1a signaling leads to oxidative stress and reduces NMDAr to impair LTP in area CA1, which contributes to IH-dependent deficits in learning and memory associated with the hippocampus.\n\nSignificanceIntermittent Hypoxia is a hallmark of sleep apnea and decreases the threshold for cognitive deficit.

Podocytes are highly differentiated and vulnerable to an array of noxious stimuli during various clinical conditions whereas podocyte loss plays a key role in progressive glomerular diseases. Elevated circulating growth hormone (GH) levels are associated with podocyte injury and proteinuria in diabetics. Previous studies have shown that podocytes express GH receptors (GHR), and induce Notch signaling when exposed to GH. However, the precise mechanism(s) by which excess GH elicits podocytopathy remains to be elucidated. In the present study, we demonstrate that GH induces cognate TGF-{beta}1 signaling and provokes cell cycle re-entry of otherwise quiescent podocytes. Though, differentiated podocytes re-enter the cell cycle in response to GH and TGF-{beta}1 unable to accomplish cytokinesis, despite nuclear division. Owing to this aberrant cell-cycle events significant amount of GH or TGF-{beta}1 treated cells remain binucleated and undergo mitotic catastrophe. Importantly, inhibition of GHR, TGFBR1, or Notch signaling prevented cell cycle re-entry and protects podocyte from cell death. Furthermore, inhibition of Notch activation prevents GH-dependent podocyte injury and proteinuria. Kidney biopsy sections from patients with diabetic nephropathy show activation of Notch signaling and bi-nucleated podocytes. All these data confirm that excess GH induces Notch1 signaling via TGF-{beta}1 and contributes to the mitotic catastrophe of podocytes. This study highlights the role of aberrant GH signaling in the podocytopathy and the potential application of inhibitors of TGF-{beta}1 or Notch inhibitors as a therapeutic agent for diabetic nephropathy.

Significance StatementElevated circulating levels of growth hormone (GH) associated with glomerular hypertrophy and proteinuria. Whereas decreased GH action protected against proteinuria. Podocytes are highly differentiated cells that play a vital role in glomerular filtration and curb protein loss. The direct role of GH in podocytes is the focus of our study. We found that GH induces TGF-{beta}1 and both provoke cell cycle re-entry of podocytes in Notch1 dependent manner. Notch activation enables the podocytes to accomplish karyokinesis, but not cytokinesis owing to which podocytes remain binucleated. Binucleated podocytes that were observed during GH/TGF-{beta}1 treatment are susceptible to cell death. Our study highlighted the fact that enforcing the differentiated podocytes to re-enter the cell cycle results in mitotic catastrophe and permanent loss.",0,147,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/597344v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/597344v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_597344.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Phylogenetic group 2 HAs contain the conserved cholesterol consensus motif (CCM) YKLW in the transmembrane region. We previously reported that mutations in the CCM retarded intracellular transport of HA and decreased its nanodomain association. Here we analyzed whether cholesterol interacts with the CCM. Incorporation of photocholesterol into HA was significantly reduced if the whole CCM is replaced by alanine, both using immunoprecipitated HA and when HA is embedded in the membrane. Next, we used reverse genetics to investigate the significance of the CCM for virus replication. No virus was rescued if the whole motif is exchanged (YKLW4A); single (LA) or double (YK2A and LW2A) mutated virus showed decreased titers and a comparative fitness disadvantage. In polarized cells transport of HA mutants to the apical membrane was not disturbed. Reduced amounts of HA and cholesterol were incorporated into the viral membrane. Mutant viruses exhibit a decrease in hemolysis, which is only partially corrected if the membrane is replenished with cholesterol. More specifically, viruses have a defect in hemifusion as demonstrated by fluorescence dequenching. Cells expressing HA-YKLW4A fuse with erythrocytes, but the number of events are reduced. Even after acidification unfused erythrocytes remain cell-bound, a phenomenon not observed with wildtype HA. We conclude that cholesterol-binding to a group 2 HA is essential for virus replication. It has pleiotropic effects on virus assembly and membrane fusion, mainly on lipid mixing and possibly a preceding step.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) is a major pathogenicity factor of Influenza viruses. Whereas the structure and function of HAs ectodomain is known in great detail, similar data for the membrane-anchoring part of the protein are missing. Here we demonstrate that the transmembrane region of a group 2 HA interacts with cholesterol, the major lipid of the plasma membrane and the defining element of the viral budding site nanodomains of the plama membrane. The cholesterol binding motif is essential for virus replication. Its partial removal affects various steps of the viral life cycle, such as assembly of new virus particles and their subsequent cell entry via membrane fusion. A cholesterol-binding pocket in group 2 HAs might be a promising target for a small lipophilic drug that inactivates the virus.",1,683,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/598953v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/598953v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_598953.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here we present a method that requires only a single measurement of TCO during controlled movements of the eye to map retinal chromatic image shifts to the image space of a pupil camera. After such calibration, TCO can be compensated by continuously monitoring eye position during experimentation and by interpolating correction vectors from a linear fit to the calibration data. The average change rate of TCO per head shift and the correlation between Kappa and the individual foveal TCA are close to the expectations based on a chromatic eye model.

We focus on the feedforward flow of information from sensory neurons to motor neurons, and apply a recently developed network analysis framework referred to as the ""hourglass effect"". The analysis reveals that this feedforward flow traverses a small core (""hourglass waist"") that consists of 10-15 interneurons. These are mostly the same interneurons that were previously shown (using a different analytical approach) to constitute the ""rich-club"" of the C. elegans connectome. This result is robust to the methodology that separates the feedforward from the feedback flow of information. The set of core interneurons remains mostly the same when we consider only chemical synapses or the combination of chemical synapses and gap junctions. The hourglass organization of the connectome suggests that C. elegans has some similarities with encoder-decoder artificial neural networks in which the input is first compressed and integrated in a low-dimensional latent space that encodes the given data in a more efficient manner, followed by a decoding network through which intermediate-level sub-functions are combined in different ways to compute the correlated outputs of the network. The core neurons at the hourglass waist represent the information bottleneck of the system, balancing the representation accuracy and compactness (complexity) of the given sensory information.

Author SummaryThe C. elegans nematode is the only species for which the complete wiring diagram (""connectome"") of its neural system has been mapped. The connectome provides architectural constraints that limit the scope of possible functions of a neural system. In this work, we identify one such architectural constraint: the C. elegans connectome includes a small set (10-15) of neurons that compress and integrate the information provided by the much larger set of sensory neurons. These intermediate-level neurons encode few sub-functions that are combined and re-used in different ways to activate the circuits of motor neurons, which drive all higher-level complex functions of the organism such as feeding or locomotion. We refer to this encoding-decoding structure as ""hourglass architecture"" and identify the core neurons at the ""waist"" of the hourglass. We also discuss the similarities between this property of the C. elegans connectome and artificial neural networks. The hourglass architecture opens a new way to think about, and experiment with, intermediate-level neurons between input and output neural circuits.",1,45,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/600999v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/600999v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_600999.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Reversible TDP-43 aggregation has been shown to precede the formation of irreversible amyloid fibrils similar to the behavior of proteins hnRNPA1 and FUS8-10. Still unknown, however, are the structural features of TDP-43 fibrils that confer both reversibility and irreversibility and how hereditary mutations can impose irreversible aggregation. Here, we determined the structures of amyloid fibrils formed by two segments previously reported to be the pathogenic cores of TDP-43 aggregation7,11,12; these are termed SegA (residues 311-360) and SegB A315E (residues 286-331 containing the ALS hereditary mutation A315E). SegA forms three polymorphs, all with dagger-shaped folds. SegB forms R-shaped folds. All four polymorphs have folds confined to two dimensions, and are stabilized by hydrophobic cores and peripheral hydrogen bonds. Energetic analysis suggests that the dagger-shaped polymorphs are examples of the irreversible fibril structures of TDP-43, whereas the SegB polymorph may participate in both reversible and irreversible fibril structure. Our structure suggests how the A315E mutation may convert this polymorph to the irreversible type and lead to mutation-enhanced pathology.",1,603,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601120v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601120v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_601120.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,data and materials availability: all structural data have been deposited into the worldwide protein data bank (wwpdb) and the electron microscopy data bank (emdb) with the following accession codes: sega-sym (pdb 6n37 emd-9339) sega-asym (pdb 6n3b emd-9350) sega-slow (pdb 6n3a emid-9349) segb a315e (pdb 6n3c emd-0334).,NA

Whereas formerly the head appeared still for much of a scan with brief excursions from baseline, the head now appears to be in constant motion, and motion estimates often seem to divulge little information about what is happening in a scan. This constant motion has been attributed to respiratory oscillations that do not alias at faster sampling rates, and investigators are divided on the extent to which such motion is \""real\"" motion or only \""apparent\"" pseudomotion. Some investigators have abandoned the use of motion estimates entirely due to these considerations. Here we investigate the properties of motion in several fMRI datasets sampled at rates between 720-1160 ms, and describe 5 distinct kinds of respiratory motion: 1) constant real respiratory motion in the form of head nodding most evident in vertical position and pitch, which can be very large; 2) constant pseudomotion at the same respiratory rate as real motion, occurring only in the phase encode direction; 3) punctate real motions occurring at times of very deep breaths; 4) a low-frequency pseudomotion in only the phase encode direction following very deep breaths; 5) slow modulation of vertical and anterior-posterior head position by the respiratory envelope. We reformulate motion estimates in light of these considerations and obtain good concordance between motion estimates, physiologic records, image quality measures, and events evident in the fMRI signals.\n\nHighlights- Examines several fast-TR datasets with sampling rates of 720-1160 ms\n- Identifies 7 kinds of motion in fMRI scans, 5 of them related to respiration\n- Identifies 2 forms of pseudomotion occurring only in phase encode direction\n- Pseudomotion is a function of soft tissue mass, not lung volume\n- Reformulates motion estimates to draw out particular kinds of motion",1,668,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601286v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601286v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_601286.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Despite the prevalence of co-use, factors that influence the suppression and enhancement of concurrent alcohol and nicotine intake are largely unknown.\n\nObjectivesOur goals were to assess how nicotine abstinence and availability influenced concurrent alcohol consumption, and to determine the impact of quinine adulteration of alcohol on aversion resistant alcohol consumption and concurrent nicotine consumption.\n\nMethodsMale and female C57BL/6J mice voluntarily consumed unsweetened alcohol, nicotine and water in a chronic 3-bottle choice procedure. In Experiment 1, nicotine access was removed for 1 week and re-introduced the following week, while the alcohol and water bottles remained available at all times. In Experiment 2, quinine (100-1000 M) was added to the 20% alcohol bottle, while the nicotine and water bottles remained unaltered.\n\nResultsIn Experiment 1, we found that alcohol consumption and preference were unaffected by the presence or absence of nicotine access in both male and female mice. In Experiment 2a, we found that quinine temporarily suppressed alcohol intake and enhanced concurrent nicotine, but not water, preference in both male and female mice. In Experiment 2b, chronic quinine suppression of alcohol intake increased nicotine consumption and preference in female mice without affecting water preference, whereas it increased water and nicotine preference in male mice.\n\nConclusionsQuinine suppression of alcohol consumption enhanced the preference for concurrent nicotine preference in male and female mice, suggesting that mice compensate for the quinine adulteration of alcohol by increasing their nicotine preference.",1,108,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601641v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601641v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_601641.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

These deficits are often attributed to the abnormal development of high-level attentional networks. However, neuroimaging evidence from amblyopia suggests that reduced MOT performance can be explained by impaired function in motion sensitive area MT+ alone. To test the hypothesis that MT+ plays an important role in MOT, we assessed whether modulation of MT+ activity using continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) influenced MOT performance in participants with normal vision. An additional experiment involving numerosity judgements of MOT stimulus elements was conducted to control for non-specific effects of MT+ cTBS on psychophysical task performance. The MOT stimulus consisted of 4 target and 4 distractor dots and was presented at 10{degrees} eccentricity in the right or left hemifield. Functional MRI-guided cTBS was applied to left MT+. Participants (n = 13, age:27 {+/-} 3) attended separate active and sham cTBS sessions where the MOT task was completed before, 5 mins post and 30 mins post cTBS. Active cTBS significantly impaired MOT task accuracy relative to baseline for the right (stimulated) hemifield 5 mins (10 {+/-} 2% reduction; t12 = 1.95, p = 0.03) and 30 mins (14 {+/-} 3% reduction; t12 = 2.96, p = 0.01) post stimulation. No impairment occurred within the left (control) hemifield after active cTBS or for either hemifield after sham cTBS. Numerosity task performance was unaffected by cTBS.

Here we present the first systematic data on IVSO among Artiodactyla, infer their ancestral social organisation, and test whether habitat, sexual dimorphism, seasonal breeding, and body size predict inter- and intraspecific variation in social organisation. We found data on social organisation for 110 of 226 artiodactyl species, of which 74.5% showed IVSO.

Greater sexual dimorphism and smaller body size both predicted more IVSO; smaller body size also predicted a higher likelihood of pair-living.

Variably present genetic markers used to elucidate strain origin, relatedness and virulence in B. pseudomallei include the Burkholderia intracellular motility factor A (bimA) and filamentous hemagglutinin 3 (fhaB3) gene variants. Three lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen types in B. pseudomallei have been described, which vary in proportion between Australian and Asian isolates. However, it remains unknown if these LPS types can be used as genetic markers for geospatial analysis within a contiguous melioidosis-endemic region. Using a combination of whole-genome sequencing (WGS), statistical analysis and geographical mapping, we examined if the LPS types can be used as geographical markers in the Northern Territory, Australia. The clinical isolates revealed that LPS A prevalence was highest in the Darwin and surrounds (n = 660; 96% being LPS A and 4% LPS B) and LPS B in the Katherine and Katherine remote and East Arnhem regions (n = 79; 60% being LPS A and 40% LPS B). Bivariate logistics regression of 999 clinical B. pseudomallei isolates revealed that the odds of getting a clinical isolate with LPS B was highest in East Arnhem in comparison to Darwin and surrounds (OR 19.5, 95% CI 9.1 - 42.0; p<0.001). This geospatial correlation was subsequently confirmed by geographically mapping the LPS type from 340 environmental Top End strains. We also found that in the Top End, the minority bimA genotype bimABm has a similar remote region geographical footprint to that of LPS B. In addition, correlation of LPS type with multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was strong, and where multiple LPS types were identified within a single sequence type, WGS confirmed homoplasy of the MLST loci. The clinical, sero-diagnostic and vaccine implications of geographically-based B. pseudomallei LPS types, and their relationships to regional and global dispersal of melioidosis, require global collaborations with further analysis of larger clinically and geospatially-linked datasets.\n\nAuthor SummaryBurkholderia pseudomallei is a pathogenic soil bacterium that causes the disease melioidosis, which occurs in many tropical regions globally and in recent years has emerged in non-tropical regions. Melioidosis has been predicted to affect 165,000 people every year resulting in an estimated 89,000 deaths. Person to person transmission is rare with most cases linked to exposure to the bacterium from the environment. The genetic background of B. pseudomallei has been well studied and variably present genes have been linked to distinct melioidosis disease states and geographic regions, however we still need a stronger understanding of the association of genes with geography. Three lipopolysaccharide types exist in B. pseudomallei and the prevalence of the lipopolysaccharide genes vary between melioidosis endemic regions, but it is unknown if the lipopolysaccharide genes can be used as geographical markers in a single melioidosis-endemic region. In this study, we used a combination of whole-genome sequencing, statistics and geographical mapping to elucidate if the three lipopolysaccharide genes can be used as geographical markers within the Northern Territory, Australia. We show that the three LPS types have distinct but overlapping geographical footprints within a single melioidosis region and can be used as geographic markers alongside a number of other important variably present B. pseudomallei genes.",1,363,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/603886v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/603886v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_603886.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Two sets of replicate 5-liter sequencing batch reactors were operated at different, low and high, F:M (0.19-0.36 mgCOD/mgTSS/d) and C:N (3.5-6.3 mgCOD/mgTKN) conditions for a period of 74 days, following 53 days of sludge acclimation. Recovery and resilience were tested during the last 14 days by operating all reactors at low F:M and C:N (henceforth termed F:M-C:N). Stable nitrite accumulation (77%) was achieved through high F:M-C:N loading with a concurrent reduction in the abundance of Nitrospira. Subsequently, only two of the three reactors experiencing a switch back from high to low F:M-C:N recovered the nitrite oxidation function, with an increase in Nitrobacter as the predominant NOB, without a recovery of Nitrospira. The AOB community was more diverse, resistant and resilient than the NOB community. We showed that functional recovery and resilience can vary across replicate reactors, and that nitrification recovery need not coincide with a return to the initial nitrifying community structure.",1,82,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/605733v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/605733v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_605733.txt,1,data availability statement,0,data availability  407  dna sequencing data are available at ncbi bioprojects prjna559245,NA

Attempts to study microbial ribosomal heterogeneity have mostly relied on comparing wild-type strains with mutants in which subunits have been deleted, but this approach does not allow direct comparison of alternate ribosome isoforms isolated from identical cellular contexts. Here, by simultaneously purifying canonical and alternative RpsR ribosomes from Mycobacterium smegmatis, we show that alternative ribosomes have distinct translational features compared with their canonical counterparts. Both alternative and canonical ribosomes actively take part in gene translation, although they translate a subset of genes with differential efficiency as measured by ribosome profiling. We also show that alternative ribosomes have a relative defect in initiation complex formation. Our work convincingly confirms the distinct and non-redundant contribution of alternative bacterial ribosomes for adaptation to hostile environments.\n\nSignificance StatementMany organisms, including most bacteria code for multiple paralogues of some ribosomal protein subunits. The relative contribution of these alternative subunits to ribosome function and gene translation is unknown and controversial. Furthermore, many studies on alternative ribosomes have been confounded by isolation of alternative and canonical ribosomes from different strains and/ or different growth conditions, potentially confounding results. Here, we show unequivocally that one form of alternative ribosome from Mycobacterium smegmatis actively engages in gene translation, but its translational profile from an identical cellular context is subtly different from canonical ribosomes.

These variants are traditionally ascertained from genome-wide association studies (GWAS), which utilize samples with tens or hundreds of thousands of individuals for whom a single summary measurement (e.g., BMI) is collected. An alternative approach is to focus on a smaller, more deeply characterized sample in conjunction with advanced statistical models that leverage detailed phenotypes. Here we use novel functional data analysis (FDA) techniques to capitalize on longitudinal growth information and construct a polygenic risk score (PRS) for obesity in children followed from birth to three years of age. This score, comprised of 24 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), is significantly higher in children with (vs. without) rapid infant weight gain--a predictor of obesity later in life. Using two independent cohorts, we show that genetic variants identified in early childhood are also informative in older children and in adults, consistent with early childhood obesity being predictive of obesity later in life. In contrast, PRSs based on SNPs identified by adult obesity GWAS are not predictive of weight gain in our cohort of children. Our research provides an example of a successful application of FDA to GWAS. We demonstrate that a deep, statistically sophisticated characterization of a longitudinal phenotype can provide increased statistical power to studies with relatively small sample sizes. This study shows how FDA approaches can be used as an alternative to the traditional GWAS.

Author SummaryFinding genetic variants that confer an increased risk of developing a particular disease has long been a focus of modern genetics. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have catalogued single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a variety of complex diseases in humans, including obesity, but by and large have done so using increasingly large samples-- tens or even hundreds of thousands of individuals, whose phenotypes are thus often only superficially characterized. This, in turn, may hide the intricacies of the genetic influence on disease. GWAS findings are also usually study-population dependent. We found that genetic risk scores based on SNPs from large adult obesity studies are not predictive of the propensity to gain weight in very young children. However, using a small cohort of a few hundred children deeply characterized with growth trajectories between birth and two years, and leveraging such trajectories through novel functional data analysis (FDA) techniques, we were able to produce a strong childhood obesity genetic risk score.",0,491,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/606277v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/606277v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_606277.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,data availability phenotypic and genetic data are/will be available under dbgap study number: phs001498.v2.p1.,NA

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans1 have implicated tens of thousands of DNA sequence variants in disease risk and quantitative trait variation, but these variants fail to account for the entire heritability of diseases and traits. GWAS have by design focused on common DNA sequence variants; however, recent studies underscore the likely importance of the contribution of rare variants to heritable variation2. Further, finding the genes that underlie the GWAS signals remains a major challenge. Here, we use a unique model system to disentangle the contributions of common and rare variants to a large number of quantitative traits. We generated large crosses among 16 diverse yeast strains and identified thousands of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) that explain most of the heritable variation in 38 traits. We combined our results with sequencing data for 1,011 yeast isolates3 to decouple variant effect size estimation from allele frequency and showed that rare variants make a disproportionate contribution to trait variation as a consequence of their larger effect sizes. Evolutionary analyses revealed that this contribution is driven by rare variants that arose recently, that such variants are more likely to decrease fitness, and that negative selection has shaped the relationship between variant frequency and effect size. Finally, we leveraged the structure of the crosses to resolve hundreds of QTLs to single genes. These results refine our understanding of trait variation at the population level and suggest that studies of rare variants are a fertile ground for discovery of genetic effects.",1,770,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/607291v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/607291v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_607291.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Although most GAS serotypes are able to form biofilms, there is large heterogeneity between individual strains in biofilm formation, as measured by standard crystal violet assays. It is generally accepted that biofilm formation includes initial adhesion of bacterial cells to a surface, followed by microcolony formation, biofilm maturation, and extensive production of extracellular matrix that links together proliferating cells and provides a scaffold for the three-dimensional biofilm structure. However, our studies show that for GAS strain JS95, microcolony formation is not an essential step in static biofilm formation, and instead, biofilm can be effectively formed from slow-growing or non-replicating late exponential or early stationary planktonic cells, via sedimentation and fixation of GAS chains into biofilms. In addition, we show that the GAS capsule specifically contributes to the alternative, sedimentation-initiated biofilms. Microcolony-independent, sedimentation biofilms are similar in morphology and 3-D structure to biofilms initiated by actively dividing planktonic bacteria. We conclude that GAS can form biofilms by an alternate, non-canonical mechanism that does not require transition from microcolony formation to biofilm maturation, and which may be obscured by biofilm phenotypes that arise via the classical biofilm maturation processes.\n\nIMPORTANCEThe static biofilm assay is a common tool for easy biomass quantification of biofilm forming bacteria. However, S. pyogenes biofilm formation as measured by the static assay is strain dependent and yields heterogeneous results for different strains of the same serotype.

These temperature-dependent changes in voltage-dependent ion channel kinetics (rates of opening, closing and inactivating) are commonly represented with Q10 coefficients or an Eyring relationship. In this paper we assess the validity of these representations by characterising channel kinetics at multiple temperatures. We focus on the hERG channel, which is important in drug safety assessment and commonly screened at room temperature, so that results require extrapolation to physiological temperature. In Part I of this study we established a reliable method for high-throughput characterisation of hERG1a (Kv11.1) kinetics, using a 15 second information-rich optimised protocol. In this Part II, we use this protocol to study the temperature dependence of hERG kinetics using CHO cells over-expressing hERG1a on the Nanion SyncroPatch 384PE, a 384-well automated patch clamp platform, with temperature control. We characterise the temperature dependence of hERG gating by fitting the parameters of a mathematical model of hERG kinetics to data obtained at five distinct temperatures between 25 and 37 {degrees}C, and validate the models using different protocols. Our models reveal that activation is far more temperature sensitive than inactivation, and we observe that the temperature dependency of the kinetic parameters is not represented well by Q10 coefficients: it broadly follows a generalised, but not the standardly-used, Eyring relationship. We also demonstrate that experimental estimations of Q10 coefficients are protocol-dependent. Our results show that a direct fit using our 15 second protocol best represents hERG kinetics at any given temperature, and suggests that predictions from the Generalised Eyring theory may be preferentially used if no experimentally-derived data are available.\n\nStatement of SignificanceIon channel currents are highly sensitive to temperature changes. Yet because many experiments are performed more easily at room temperature, it is common to extrapolate findings to physiological temperatures through the use of Q10 coefficients or Eyring rate theory. By applying short, information-rich protocols that we developed in Part I of this study we identify how kinetic parameters change over temperature. We find that the commonly-used Q10 and Eyring formulations are incapable of describing the parameters temperature dependence, a more Generalised Eyring relationship works well, but remeasuring kinetics and refitting a model is optimal. The findings have implications for the accuracy of the many applications of Q10 coefficients in electrophysiology, and suggest that care is needed to avoid misleading extrapolations in their many scientific and industrial pharmaceutical applications.",1,804,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/609719v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/609719v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_609719.txt,1,general-purpose repository,1,all codes and data are freely available at https://github.com/cardiacmodelling/ hergrapidcharacterisation.;     all codes and data are freely available at https://github.com/cardiacmodelling/ hergrapidcharacterisation.,all codes and data are freely available at https://github.com/cardiacmodelling/ hergrapidcharacterisation.;     all codes and data are freely available at https://github.com/cardiacmodelling/ hergrapidcharacterisation.

Each of these components is replicated for cell reproduction. To address an essential role of the huge diversity of cellular components, we study a model of protocells that convert resources into catalysts with the aid of a catalytic reaction network. As the resources are limited, it is shown that diversity in intracellular components is increased to allow the use of diverse resources for cellular growth. Scaling relation is demonstrated between resource abundances and molecular diversity. We then study how the molecule species diversify and complex catalytic reaction networks develop through the evolutionary course.

In the present study, we found that HFD greatly enhanced starvation-induced hyperactivity. HFD increased the excitability of these OA neurons to a hunger hormone named adipokinetic hormone (AKH), via increasing the accumulation of AKH receptor (AKHR) in these neurons. Upon HFD, excess dietary lipids were transported by a lipoprotein LTP to enter these OA neurons via the cognate receptor LpR1, which activated AMPK-TOR signaling and suppressed autophagy-dependent degradation of AKHR.

These advances have overturned two long-held dogmas: only adaptive immunity confers immunological memory and innate immunity lacks specificity. This work describes the novel observation that innate immune effector cells can be recruited to specific tissues of the body where pathology is present by using a microbial-based immune stimulus that consists of an inactivated pathogen that typically resides or causes infection in that target tissue site. We demonstrate this principle using experimental models of cancer and infection for which different subcutaneously delivered microbial-based treatments were shown to induce the recruitment of immune effector cells to specific diseased organs. Amelioration of disease in a given organ niche was dependent on matching the correct microbial stimulus for the affected organ site but was independent of the nature of the pathology. This observation intriguingly suggests that the immune system, upon pathogen recognition, tends to direct its resources to the compartment in which the pathogen has previously been encountered and would be the most likely source of infection. Importantly, this phenomenon provides a novel means to therapeutically target innate immune effector cells to sites of specific disease localization to potentially treat a wide spectrum of pathologies, including cancer, infection, and chronic inflammatory disorders.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYVaccines that target adaptive immune memory have revolutionized medicine. This study describes a novel strategy that works as a modified innate immune \""vaccine\"" that exploits the trained response of innate immune effector cells to clear pathology in a specific tissue site. Unlike memory of the adaptive immune system, which functions like a lock and key, innate immune memory is more akin to a reflex response - like experienced muscle or neural cells that are changed by a stimulus to respond more efficiently upon re-exposure. This change in behavior through experience is the definition of learning. Our study suggests that this innate immune learning occurs at different levels. Emergency hematopoiesis trains new innate immune cells in the bone marrow to respond quickly and effectively to a non-specific threat; whereas, pathogen-specific training occurs at sites where cells making up the immunologic niche have had interactions with a particular pathogen and have been trained to respond more robustly to it upon re-presentation in the context of a danger signal. The speed with which new immune cells are trained in the bone marrow in response to an imminent microbial threat and their subsequent recruitment to the target organ site where that microbe typically resides suggests there are ways the immune system communicates to coordinate this rapid response that are yet to be fully delineated. These findings provide a novel highly proficient way to harness the potent effector functions of the innate immune system to address a wide range of immune-based diseases.",0,340,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/612598v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/612598v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_612598.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Understanding the mechanism of PafBC activation is impeded by a lack of structural information on this transcription factor that contains a widespread, but poorly understood WYL domain frequently encountered in bacterial transcription factors. Here, we determined the crystal structure of Arthrobacter aurescens PafBC. The protein consists of two modules, each harboring an N-terminal helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain followed by a central WYL and a C-terminal extension (WCX) domain. The WYL domains exhibit Sm-folds, while the WCX domains adopt ferredoxin-like folds, both characteristic for RNA binding proteins. Our results suggest a mechanism of regulation in which WYL domain-containing transcription factors may be activated by binding RNA molecules.

Using the blocking/unblocking paradigm, we found that when actor rats have fully learned a stimulus-self reward association, adding a cue that predicted additional partner reward unblocked associative learning about this cue. In contrast, additional cues that did not predict partner reward remained blocked from acquiring associative value.

Small RNAs with homology to telomeres have been observed in several organisms and could originate from telomeres or from interstitial telomere sequences (ITSs), which are composites of degenerate and perfect telomere repeat sequences found on chromosome arms. We identified C. elegans small RNAs composed of the Caenorhabditis telomere sequence (TTAGGC)n with up to three mismatches, which might interact with telomeres. We rigorously defined ITSs for genomes of C. elegans and for two closely related nematodes, C. briggsae and C. remanei. We found that most telomeric small RNAs with mismatches originated from ITSs, which were depleted from mRNAs and but were enriched in introns whose genes often displayed hallmarks of genomic silencing. C. elegans small RNAs composed of perfect telomere repeats were very rare but were increased by several orders of magnitude in C. briggsae and C. remanei. Major small RNA species in C. elegans begin with a 5 guanine nucleotide, which was strongly depleted from perfect telomeric small RNAs of all three Caenorhabditis species. Perfect telomeric small RNAs corresponding to the G-rich strand of the telomere commonly began with 5 UAGGCU and 5UUAGGC, whereas C-rich strand RNAs commonly begin with 5CUAAGC. In contrast, telomeric small RNAs with mismatches had a mixture of all four 5 nucleotides.

We identified chronic disease multimorbidity patterns in Koreans 50 years of age or older, and explored whether such patterns were associated with particular sociodemographic factors and health-related quality-of-life.\n\nMethodsThe multimorbidity patterns of 10 chronic diseases (hypertension, dyslipidemia, stroke, osteoarthritis, tuberculosis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, depression, diabetes mellitus, and thyroid disease) were identified via latent class analysis of data on 8,370 Korean adults aged 50+ years who participated in the sixth Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2013-2015). The associations between multimorbidity patterns, and sociodemographic factors and health-related quality of life, were subjected to regression analysis.\n\nResultsThree patterns of multimorbidity were identified: 1) a relatively healthy group (60.4% of the population); 2) a  cardiometabolic conditions group (27.8%); and, 3) an  arthritis, asthma, allergic rhinitis, depression, and thyroid disease group (11.8%). The female (compared to male) gender was associated with an increased likelihood of membership of the cardiometabolic conditions group (odds ratio [OR]=1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.15-1.51) and (to a much greater extent) the arthritis, asthma, allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group (OR=4.32, 95% CI=3.30-5.66). Low socioeconomic status was associated with membership of the two multimorbidity classes. Membership of the arthritis, asthma, allergy, depression, and thyroid disease group was associated with a significantly poorer health-related quality-of-life than was membership of the other two groups.\n\nConclusionThe co-occurrence of chronic diseases was not attributable to chance.

Such respiratory fluctuations can have substantial influence in studies of fMRI signal covariance in subjects at rest, the so-called \""resting state functional connectivity\"" technique. If respiration is monitored during fMRI scanning, it is typically done using a belt about the subjects abdomen to record abdominal circumference. Several measures have been derived from these belt records, including the windowed envelope of the waveform (ENV), the windowed variance in the waveform (respiration variation, RV), and a measure of the amplitude of each breath divided by the cycle time of the breath (respiration volume per time, RVT). Any attempt to gauge respiratory contributions to fMRI signals requires a respiratory measure, but little is known about how these measures compare to each other, or how they perform beyond the small studies in which they were initially proposed. In this paper, we examine the properties of these measures in hundreds of healthy young adults scanned for an hour each at rest, a subset of the Human Connectome Project chosen for having high-quality physiological records. We find: 1) ENV, RV, and RVT are all similar, though ENV and RV are more similar to each other than to RVT; 2) respiratory events like deep breaths exhibit characteristic fMRI signal changes, head motions, and image quality abnormalities time-locked to deep breaths evident in the belt traces; 3) all measures can \""miss\"" respiratory events evident in the belt traces; 4) RVT \""misses\"" deep breaths (i.e., yawns and sighs) more than ENV or RV; 5) all respiratory measures change systematically over the course of a 14.4-minute scan, decreasing in mean value.

In this species big ants have larger heads relative to their size than small ants. Hence, their center of mass is shifted forward, and the more so when they are carrying a load in their mandibles. We tested the hypothesis that this could lead to big ants being less statically stable than small ants, thus explaining their lower load carriage performances. When walking unloaded we found that big ants were indeed less statically stable than small ants but that they were nonetheless able to adjust their stepping pattern to partly compensate for this instability. When ants were walking loaded on the other hand, there was no evidence of different locomotor behaviors in individuals of different sizes. Loaded ants, whatever their size, move too slowly to maintain their balance through dynamic stability. Rather, they seem to do so by clinging to the ground with their hind legs during part of a stride.

In the Drosophila embryonic salivary gland placode Rok is planar polarised at the tissue boundary, through a negative regulation by the apical polarity protein Crumbs that is anisotropically localised at the boundary. However, in inner cells of the placode both Crumbs and Rok are isotropically enriched at junctions. We propose a model that reconciles both behaviours through modulation of Rok membrane residence time by Crumbs and downstream effectors. Using FRAP in embryos expressing endogenously-tagged Rok combined with in silico simulations, we find that the lower membrane dissociation rate (koff) of Rok at the tissue boundary, where Crumbs membrane levels are lower, explains this boundary-specific effect. The S/T-kinase Pak1 negatively affects Rok membrane association in vivo within the epidermis, and in vitro can phosphorylate Rok near the PH domain that mediates membrane association. Pak1 is recruited to the membrane by Cdc42 which, like its binding partner Crumbs, shows anisotropic localisation at the boundary.

San Diego,2019-04-22,1,cc_by_nc_nd,Neuroscience,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/04/22/615450.source.xml,"Neural oscillations are observed ubiquitously in the mammalian brain, but their stability is known to be rather variable. Some oscillations are tonic and last for seconds or even minutes. Other oscillations appear as unstable bursts. Likewise, some oscillations rely on excitatory AMPAergic synapses, but others are GABAergic and inhibitory. Why this diversity exists is not clear. We hypothesized Ca 2+ -dependent homeostasis could be important in finding an explanation. We tested this hypothesis in a highly simplified model of hippocampal neurons. In this model homeostasis profoundly alters the modulatory effect of neural oscillations. Under homeostasis, tonic AMPAergic oscillations actually decrease excitability and desynchronize firing. Tonic oscillations that are synaptically GABAergic-like those in real hippocampus-dont provoke a homeostatic response, however. If our simple model is correct, homeostasis can explain why the theta rhythm in the hippocampus is synaptically inhibitory: GABA has little to no intrinsic homeostatic response, and so can preserve the pyramidal cells natural dynamic range. Based on these results we can also speculate that homeostasis may explain why AMPAergic oscillations in cortex, and hippocampus, often appear as bursts. Bursts do not interact with the slow homeostatic time constant, and so retain their normal excitatory effect.

The interplay between oscillatory modulation and homeostasis is not. We studied oscillatory modulation and homeostasis for the first time using a simplified model of hippocampus.

One emerging factor is the influence of parental exposures on offspring phenotype, known as intergenerational carryover effects. Parental exposure may deliver beneficial or detrimental characteristics to offspring that can influence larval recruitment patterns, thus shaping how populations and community structure respond to ocean change. Impacts of adult exposure to elevated winter temperature and pCO2 on reproduction and offspring viability were examined in the Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida) using three populations of adult, hatchery-reared O. lurida, plus an additional cohort spawned from one of the populations. Oysters were sequentially exposed to elevated temperature (+4{degrees}C, at 10{degrees}C), followed by elevated pCO2 (+2204 {micro}atm, at 3045 {micro}atm) during winter months. Male gametes were more developed after elevated temperature exposure and less developed after high pCO2 exposure, but there was no impact on female gametes or sex ratios. Oysters previously exposed to elevated winter temperature released larvae earlier, regardless of pCO2 exposure. Those exposed to elevated winter temperature as a sole treatment released more larvae on a daily basis, but when also exposed to high pCO2 there was no effect. These combined results indicate that elevated winter temperature accelerates O. lurida spermatogenesis, resulting in earlier larval release and increased production, with elevated pCO2 exposure negating effects of elevated temperature. Altered recruitment patterns may therefore follow warmer winters due to precocious spawning, but these effects may be masked by coincidental high pCO2. Offspring were reared in common conditions for one year, then deployed for three months in four estuarine bays with distinct environmental conditions. Offspring of parents exposed to elevated pCO2 had higher survival rates in two of the four bays. This carryover effect demonstrates that parental conditions can have substantial ecologically relevant impacts that should be considered when predicting impacts of environmental change. Furthermore, Olympia oysters may be more resilient in certain environments when progenitors are pre-conditioned in stressful conditions. Combined with other recent studies, our work suggests that the Olympia may be more equipped than other oysters for the challenge of a changing ocean.",1,84,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/616375v4?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/616375v4.full.pdf,_10.1101_616375.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Autosomal recessive mutations are known to be the underlying cause of several Mendelian metabolic diseases, especially among the offspring of related individuals. In line with this, inbreeding coefficient of an individual as a measure of cryptic autozygosity among the general population is known to lead adverse metabolic outcomes including Type 2 diabetes (T2DM); a multifactorial metabolic disease for which the recessive genetic causes remain unknown. In order to unravel such effects for multiple metabolic facades of the disease, we investigated the relationship between the excess of homozygosity and the metabolic signature of T2DM.

Serotonergic neurons broadly innervate the optic ganglia of Drosophila melanogaster, a widely used model for studying vision. The role for serotonergic signaling in the Drosophila optic lobe and the mechanisms by which serotonin regulates visual neurons remain unclear. Here we map the expression patterns of serotonin receptors in the visual system, focusing on a subset of cells with processes in the first optic ganglion, the lamina, and show that serotonin can modulate visual responses. Serotonin receptors are expressed in several types of columnar cells in the lamina including 5-HT2B in lamina monopolar cell L2, required for the initial steps of visual processing, and both 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B in T1 cells, whose function is unknown. Subcellular mapping with GFP-tagged 5-HT2B and 5-HT1A constructs indicates that these receptors localize to layer M2 of the medulla, proximal to serotonergic boutons, suggesting that the medulla is the primary site of serotonergic regulation for these neurons. Serotonin increases intracellular calcium in L2 terminals in layer M2 and alters the kinetics of visually induced calcium transients in L2 neurons following dark flashes. These effects were not observed in flies without a functional 5-HT2B, which displayed severe differences in the amplitude and kinetics of their calcium response to both dark and light flashes. While we did not detect serotonin receptor expression in L1 neurons, they also undergo serotonin-induced calcium changes, presumably via cell non-autonomous signaling pathways. We provide the first functional data showing a role for serotonergic neuromodulation of neurons required for initiating visual processing in Drosophila and establish a new platform for investigating the serotonergic neuromodulation of sensory networks.

Author SummarySerotonergic neurons innervate the Drosophila melanogaster eye, but the function of serotonergic signaling is not known. We found that serotonin receptors are expressed in all neuropils of the optic lobe and identify specific neurons involved in visual information processing that express serotonin receptors. We then demonstrate that activation of these receptors can alter how visual information is processed. These are the first data suggesting a functional role for serotonergic signaling in Drosophila vision.

These changes might in turn alter the circadian system both at behavioral and molecular levels, with knock-on effects on daily physiological processes and behavioural outputs. We examined the evolutionary impact of size-selective mortality on collective risk-taking behavior and the circadian system in a model fish species. We exposed zebrafish (Danio rerio) to either large or small size-selective mortality relative to a control over five generations, followed by eight generations during which harvesting halted to remove maternal effects. Large size-selective mortality typical of many fisheries and specialized predators targeting larger size classes decreased collective risk-taking behavior compared to controls. The opposite occurred in response to small size-selective mortality typical of specialized fisheries and most gape-limited predators. The evolutionary changes in risk-taking behavior were linked to daily activity rhythms in response to small size-selective mortality, while no changes were observed in response to large size-selective mortality. We also found changes in the molecular circadian core clockwork in response to both size selective mortality treatments. These changes disappeared in the clock output pathway, resulting in similar transcription profiles of both size-selected lines. The results suggest a switch downstream to the molecular circadian core clockwork, leading to overall similar daily activity patterns across selection lines. Our experimental harvest left an evolutionary legacy in collective risktaking behavior and relatedly in the circadian system, both at behavioral and molecular levels. Changes to risk-sensitive behavior of exploited organisms can have far-reaching consequences for how space and time is used and may also affect catchability and natural predation.",0,398,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/622043v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/622043v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_622043.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here, we identify an uncharacterized human lncRNA from influenza A virus (IAV) patients, antivirus and activate neutrophil (AVAN), that is significantly up-regulated upon virus infection. Mechanistically, nuclear lncRNA-AVAN positively regulates the transcription of forkhead box O3A (FOXO3a) by associating with its promoter and inducing chromatin remodeling to promote neutrophil chemotaxis. Furthermore, we also found that cytoplasmic lncRNA-AVAN directly binds tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) and enhances the association of TRIM25 and Retinoic acid inducible gene-1 proteins (RIG-I) and the ubiquitylation of RIG-I, thereby promoting TRIM25- and RIG-I-mediated antiviral innate immune signaling. More importantly, we enforced the expression of AVAN in transgenic mice and found that it significantly alleviated IAV virulence and virus production.

Individuals who age faster have intrinsically higher mortality rates and so are preferentially lost over time, in a phenomenon known as cohort selection. In this paper, we use simulations to show that cohort selection biases cross-sectional analysis away from identifying causal loci of aging, to the point where cross-sectional studies are less likely to identify loci that cause aging than if loci had been chosen at random.

However, there is no systematic review and meta-analysis that has been done in a multi-ethnic population like Malaysia. This systematic review aims to determine the trend in prevalence, awareness and control of hypertension in Malaysia.\n\nMethodsSystematic searches were conducted in PubMed, Scopus, Ovid, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Malaysian Medical Repository and Malaysia Citation Index published between 1980 and 2017. All original articles in English were included. Studies included were those on adults aged 18 years and above. Studies of prevalence in children and adolescents and pregnancy related hypertension were excluded. Two authors independently reviewed the studies, carried out data extraction and performed quality assessment. Heterogeneity between studies and publication bias was assessed and effect size was pooled by the random effect model.\n\nResultsFifty-six studies with a total of 241,796 subjects were included. The prevalence of hypertension throughout Malaysia varied (I2 = 99.3%). The overall pooled prevalence of hypertension over the past 4 decades was 28.2% in adults aged 18 years and older (95% CI: 26.1 - 33.3) and the prevalence in those 30 years and older was 40.0% (95% CI: 35.3-44.8).\n\nFor subgroup analysis, the prevalence of hypertension in male aged 18 and above was 31.4% (95% CI: 26.5 - 36.2) and 27.8% in female (95% CI: 20.7 - 34.9). The prevalence of hypertension among the ethnic groups aged 18 years and above were 37.3% in Malays (95% CI: 32.9 - 41.7); 36.4% in Chinese (95% CI 31.6 - 41.2) and 34.8% in Indians (95% CI: 31.2-38.4). The prevalence of hypertension was the lowest in the 1980s (16.2%, 95% CI: 13.4-19.0%), increases up to 36.8% in the 1990s (95% CI: 6.1-67.5), then came down to 28.7% (95% CI: 21.7-35.8) in the 2000s and 29.2% (95% CI: 24.0-34.4) in the 2010s. The prevalence of awareness was 38.7% (95% CI: 31.7 - 45.8) whereas the control of hypertension of those on treatment was 33.3% (95% CI: 28.4 - 38.2).\n\nConclusionThree in 10 adults aged 18 years old and above have hypertension, whereas four in 10 adults aged 30 years old and above have hypertension.

ANO1 is activated by elevation of cytosolic Ca2+ and modulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2). Here we describe a closely concerted experimental and computational study, including electrophysiology, mutagenesis, functional assays, and extended sampling of lipid-protein interactions with molecular dynamics (MD) to characterize PI(4,5)P2 binding modes and sites on ANO1. ANO1 currents in excised inside-out patches activated by 270 nM Ca2+ at +100 mV are increased by exogenous PI(4,5)P2 with an EC50 = 1.24 {micro}M. The effect of PI(4,5)P2 is dependent on membrane voltage and Ca2+ and is explained by a stabilization of the ANO1 Ca2+-bound open state. Unbiased atomistic MD simulations with 1.4 mol% PI(4,5)P2 in a phosphatidylcholine bilayer identified 8 binding sites with significant probability of binding PI(4,5)P2. Three of these sites captured 85% of all ANO1 - PI(4,5)P2 interactions. Mutagenesis of basic amino acids near the membrane-cytosol interface found three regions of ANO1 critical for PI(4,5)P2 regulation that correspond to the same three sites identified by MD. PI(4,5)P2 is stabilized by hydrogen bonding between amino acid sidechains and phosphate/hydroxyl groups on PI(4,5)P2. Binding of PI(4,5)P2 alters the position of the cytoplasmic extension of TM6, which plays a crucial role in ANO1 channel gating, and increases the accessibility of the inner vestibule to Cl-ions. We propose a model consisting of a network of three PI(4,5)P2 binding sites at the cytoplasmic face of the membrane allosterically regulating ANO1 channel gating.\n\nSignificance statementMembrane proteins dwell in a sea of phospholipids that not only structurally stabilize the proteins by providing a hydrophobic environment for their transmembrane segments, but also dynamically regulate protein function. While many cation channels are known to be regulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), relatively little is known about anion channel regulation by phosphoinositides. Using a combination of patch clamp electrophysiology and atomistic molecular dynamics simulations, we have identified several PI(4,5)P2 binding sites in ANO1 (TMEM16A), a Cl- channel that performs myriad physiological functions from epithelial fluid secretion to regulation of electrical excitability. These binding sites form a band at the cytosolic interface of the membrane that we propose constitute a network to dynamically regulate this highly allosteric protein.",1,127,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/625897v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/625897v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_625897.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

MPS1 is recruited to unattached kinetochores where it phosphorylates KNL1, BUB1 and MAD1 to initiate the spindle checkpoint. This arrests the cell cycle until all kinetochores have been stably captured by microtubules. MPS1 also contributes to the error correction process rectifying incorrect kinetochore attachments. MPS1 activity at kinetochores requires auto-phosphorylation at multiple sites including T676 in the activation segment or \""T-loop\"". We now demonstrate that a BUBR1-bound pool of PP2A-B56 regulates MPS1 T-loop autophosphorylation and hence activation status in mammalian cells. Overriding this regulation using phospho-mimetic mutations in the MPS1 T-loop to generate a constitutively active kinase results in a prolonged mitotic arrest with continuous turn-over of microtubule-kinetochore attachments.

PyVs have previously been considered highly host restricted in mammalian hosts, with host-switching events thought rare or nonexistent. Prior investigations have revealed short-range host-switching events of PyVs in two different African bat species within the horseshoe bat genus Rhinolophus. Herein, we have conducted a systematic investigation of PyVs in 1,083 archived bat samples collected from five provinces across China, and identified 192 PyVs from 186 bats from 15 host species within 6 families (Rhinolophidae, Vespertilionidae, Hipposideridae, Emballonuridae, Miniopteridae and Pteropodidae) representing 28 newly-described PyVs, indicative of extensive genetic diversity of bat PyVs. Surprisingly, two PyVs were identified in multiple bat species from different families, and another PyV clustered phylogenetically with PyVs carried by bats from a different host family, indicative of three inter-family PyV host-switching events. The time to most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the three events was estimated at 0.02-11.6 million years ago (MYA), which is inconsistent with the estimated tMRCA of their respective bat hosts (36.3-66.7 MYA), and is most parsimoniously explained by host-switching events. PyVs identified from geographically separated Chinese horseshoe bat species in the present study showed close genetic identities, and clustered with each other and with PyVs from African horseshoe bats, allowing assessment of the effects of positive selection in VP1 within the horseshoe bat family Rhinolophidae. Correlation analysis indicated that co-evolution with their hosts contributed much more to evolutionary divergence of PyV than geographic distance. In conclusion, our findings provide the first evidence of inter-family host-switching events of PyV in mammals and challenge the prevailing evolutionary paradigm for strict host restriction of mammalian PyVs.\n\nAuthor summarySince the discovery of murine polyomavirus in the 1950s, polyomaviruses (PyVs) have been considered both genetically stable and highly host-restricted in their mammalian hosts. In this study, we have identified multiple cases of host-switching events of PyVs by large scale surveillance in diverse bat species collected in China. These host-switching events occurred between bat families living in the same colony, indicating that a large population with frequent contacts between different bat species may represent an ecological niche facilitating PyV host-switching. The cases studied involved members of bats from several families, including horseshoe bats, which were previously found to harbor a number of highly virulent viruses to both humans and domestic animals. Our findings have provided evidence that even highly host-specific DNA viruses can transmit between bats of different species and indicate an increased propensity for spillover events involving horseshoe bats. We propose an evolutionary scheme for bat-borne PyVs in which intra-host divergence and host-switching has generated the diverse PyVs in present day bats. This scheme provides a useful model to study the evolution of PyVs in other hosts and, potentially, the modeling of bat zoonoses and the transmission of other DNA viruses in other mammals, including humans.",0,506,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/627158v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/627158v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_627158.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The larvae of Pieris butterflies express nitrile-specifier proteins (NSPs), a key innovation for overcoming the glucosinolate (GLS)-myrosinase-based defense system of their Brassicales host-plants. NSPs are a member of the NSP-like gene family, which includes the major allergen (MA) protein, a paralog of NSP with a GLS-disarming function, and a single domain major allergen (SDMA) protein, whose function is unknown. The arms-race between a highly variable host-plant defense system and members of the NSP-like gene family is suggested to mediate diversification in both Pierid butterflies and Brassicales plants. Here, we combined feeding experiments using 25 Brassicaceae plants and five Pieris species with larval transcriptome data to investigate the evolutionary forces acting on NSP-like gene family members associated with patterns of host-plant usage. Although we observed significantly elevated nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratios in NSPs, no such pattern was observed in MAs or SDMAs.

Our data indicate that NSPs have evolved in response to shifting preferences for host plants among five Pieris butterflies, whereas MAs and SDMAs appear to have more conserved functions.

Experimental data show that during in vitro infection both viruses exhibit qualitatively distinct replication cycle kinetics. Chikungunya viral load rapidly accumulates within the first several hours post infection whereas Zika virus begins to increase at much later times. We sought to characterize these qualitatively distinct in vitro kinetics of chikungunya and Zika viruses by fitting a family of mathematical models to time course viral load datasets. We demonstrate that the standard viral kinetic model, which considers that new infections result only from free virus penetrating susceptible cells, does not fit experimental data as well as a model in which the number of virus-infected cells is the primary determinant of infection rate. We provide biologically meaningful quantifications of the main viral kinetic parameters and show that our results support cell-to-cell or localized transmission as a significant contributor to viral infection with chikungunya and Zika viruses.\n\nImportanceMathematical modeling has become a useful tool to tease out information about virus-host interactions and thus complements experimental work in characterizing and quantifying processes within viral replication cycle. Importantly, mathematical models can fill in incomplete data sets and identify key parameters of infection, provided the appropriate model is used. The in vitro time course dynamics of mosquito transmitted viruses, such as chikungunya and Zika, have not been studied by mathematical modeling and thus limits our knowledge about quantitative description of the individual determinants of viral replication cycle. This study employs dynamical modeling framework to show that the rate at which cells become virus-infected is proportional to the number or virus-infected cells rather than free extracellular virus in the milieu, a widely accepted assumption in models of viral infections. Using the refined mathematical model in combination with viral load data, we provide quantification of the main drivers of chikungunya and Zika in vitro kinetics.

CRISPR homing gene drives have shown much promise for providing an effective drive mechanism, but they typically suffer from the rapid formation of resistance alleles. Even if the problem of resistance can be overcome, the utility of such drives would still be limited by their tendency to spread into all areas of a population. To provide additional options for gene drive applications that are substantially less prone to the formation of resistance alleles and could potentially remain confined to a target area, we developed several designs for CRISPR-based gene drives utilizing toxin-antidote (TA) principles. These drives target and disrupt an essential gene with the drive providing rescue. Here, we assess the performance of several types of TA gene drive systems using modeling and individual-based simulations. We show that Toxin-Antidote Recessive Embryo (TARE) drive should allow for the design of robust, regionally confined, population modification strategies with high flexibility in choosing drive promoters and recessive lethal targets. Toxin-Antidote Dominant Embryo (TADE) drive requires a haplolethal target gene and a germline-restricted promoter but should enable the design of both faster regional population modification drives and even regionally-confined population suppression drives. Toxin-antidote dominant sperm (TADS) drive can be used for population modification or suppression. It spreads nearly as quickly as a homing drive and can flexibly use a variety of promoters, but unlike the other TA systems, it is not regionally confined and requires highly specific target genes.

However, if life history traits that promote gene flow buffer populations from such impacts, conservation efforts should aim to maintain those traits in vulnerable species. Tibetan antelope (Pantholops hodgsonii) has experienced population reduction by 95% due to poaching during the 20th century. We hypothesize that opportunities for gene flow provided by their sex-specific migration buffered their genetic diversity from the poaching impacts. We measured the mtDNA (control region, CR) and nuDNA (microsatellites or STRs) diversity, population differentiation, along with the change in effective population size (pre-poaching era vs. post-poaching era) and tested for a genetic bottleneck. Our results showed that Tibetan antelope maintained considerable genetic diversity in both mtDNA CR and STR markers (Hd = 0.9970 and Hobs = 0.8446, respectively), despite a marked reduction in post-poaching effective population size 368.9 (95% CI of 249.3 - 660.6) compared to the pre-poaching average (4.93x103 - 4.17x104). Post-poached populations also had low population structure and showed no evidence of a genetic bottleneck. Pairwise Fst values using CR haplotype frequencies were higher than those using STR allele frequencies, suggesting different degrees of gene flow mediated by females and males. This study suggests that the Tibetan antelopes sex-specific migration buffered their loss of genetic diversity in the face of severe demographic decline. These findings highlight the importance of recognizing the traits likely to maintain genetic diversity and promoting conservation efforts that allow them to be exercised.

Using a single-cell reporter of SSA repair, we measure SSA repair efficiency in young and old cells, and report a 23.4% decline in repair efficiency. This decline is not due to increased usage of non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Instead, we identify increased G1-phase duration in old cells as a factor responsible for the decreased SSA repair efficiency.

Nucleosomes, with the (H3-H4)2 tetrasome as a likely intermediate, are highly dynamic in nature by way of several different mechanisms. We have recently shown that tetrasomes spontaneously change the direction of their DNA wrapping between left- and right-handed conformations, which may prevent torque build-up in chromatin during active transcription or replication. DNA sequence has been shown to strongly affect nucleosome positioning throughout chromatin. It is not known, however, whether DNA sequence also impacts the dynamic properties of tetrasomes. To address this question, we examined tetrasomes assembled on a high-affinity DNA sequence using freely orbiting magnetic tweezers. In this context, we also studied the effects of mono- and divalent salts on the flipping dynamics. We found that neither DNA sequence nor altered buffer conditions affect overall tetrasome structure. In contrast, tetrasomes bound to high-affinity DNA sequences showed significantly altered flipping kinetics, predominantly via a reduction in the lifetime of the canonical state of left-handed wrapping. Increased mono- and divalent salt concentrations counteracted this behaviour. Thus, our study indicates that high-affinity DNA sequences impact not only the positioning of the nucleosome, but that they also endow the subnucleosomal tetrasome with enhanced conformational plasticity. This may provide a means to prevent histone loss upon exposure to torsional stress, thereby contributing to the integrity of chromatin at high-affinity sites.\n\nSTATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCECanonical (H3-H4)2 tetrasomes possess high conformational flexibility, as evidenced by their spontaneous flipping between states of left- and right-handed DNA wrapping. Here, we show that these conformational dynamics of tetrasomes cannot be described by a fixed set of rates over all conditions. Instead, an accurate description of their behavior must take into account details of their loading, in particular the underlying DNA sequence. In vivo, differences in tetrasome flexibility could be regulated by modifications of the histone core or the tetrasomal DNA, and as such constitute an intriguing, potentially adjustable mechanism for chromatin to accommodate the torsional stress generated by processes such as transcription and replication.",1,174,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/629485v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/629485v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_629485.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Depending on what is to be understood by non-interacting behavior, several reference models have been developed in the literature. One of them is the celebrated Bliss independence model, which assimilates non-interaction with statistical independence. Intuitively, this requires the dose-response curves to have zero as minimal effect and one as maximal effect, a restriction that was indeed adopted by Bliss. However, we show how non-interaction can be interpreted in terms of statistical independence, while nevertheless allowing arbitrary values for the minimal and the maximal effect. Furthermore, our reference model allows the maximal effects of the dose-response curves to be different. In a first step, we construct a basic reference model for the case of two drugs and where the maximal effects of the two individual dose-response curves are assumed to be equal. By relying on the notion of non-interaction in terms of statistical independence, and by introducing two consistency principles, we show how a unique reference model can be derived. In a second step, a more general reference model, allowing the maximal effects to be different while still restricting to two drugs, is then easily constructed from the basic reference model. Finally, an induction step is applied to generalize the reference model to the case of an arbitrary number of drugs, allowing each dose-response curve to have a possibly different maximal effect. Although the minimal effect of the dose-response curves are restricted to be equal, which we show to be a necessary consequence of consistency rules, its value is arbitrary.\n\nAuthor summaryThe Bliss independence model is a very popular reference model for drug combinations, meaning that it predicts the combined effect of doses of given drugs under the assumption of non-interaction between these drugs. However, because Bliss described non-interaction as statistical independence, he thought that he had to assume that the minimal effect of all dose-response curves are zero, while the maximal effect of all dose-response curves are one. While it is acceptable that all dose-response curves have minimal effect zero, because this amounts to having a common reference state (i.e. the response when no drug at all is given), it is a severe restriction to force all dose-response curves to have maximal effect one. On the other hand, the Bliss independence model has the advantage that it relies on sound statistical theory, and the assimilation of non-interaction with statistical independence is rather intuitive. We have extended the Bliss independence model to allow the involved dose-response curves to have different maximal effects. This has been done in a rigorous way, where the statistical underlying theory that was used by Bliss remains essentially intact.",0,748,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/630616v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/630616v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_630616.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In 2009, the Chinese government introduced the Public Health Service Equalization (PHSE) program to restore the primary healthcare system in both essential medical care and public health service provision. This study evaluates the impact of management on hypertension control and evaluate how the program works.\n\nMethodsThe China National Health Development Research Centre (CNHDRC) undertook the Cross-sectional Health Service Interview Survey (CHSIS) of 62,097 people from primary healthcare reform pilot areas, across 17 provinces from eastern, central and western parts of China in 2014. This study is based on CHSIS survey responses from 9,607 participants, who had been diagnosed with hypertension. Regression analysis was used to estimate the impact of management provided under PHSE on hypertension control adjusting for the effects of other known determinants of hypertension control.\n\nFindingsUncontrolled hypertension was markedly lower among respondents, whose hypertension had been managed (22.4% in managed patients versus 31.1% in unmanaged patients, p<0.001). The interaction between PHSE management and the geographical region was highly significant in the model (p<0.001), suggesting that the PHSE program was not equally effective in all regions. Further analysis suggested that approximately 10% of regional variability was attributed to differences in administrative systems, as there was a significant association (P=0.014) between the presence of established regional Information Management Systems (IMS) and increased PHSE effectiveness. Insurance ({chi}2(5)=4.4, p=0.496) and Hukou ({chi}2(1)=2.4, p=0.121), which denote social security and urban rural differences, respectively, were not significant predictor of hypertension control.\n\nConclusionActive management of hypertension through the PHSE program was effective with 7.31 million more patients receiving hypertension control and equalization of service delivery was reflected to some extent.

The master regulators of oxygen homeostasis in mammalian cells are the heterodimeric hypoxia-inducible transcription factors HIF-1 and HIF-2. The oxygen-labile HIF-2 subunit has not only been implicated in transcription, but also as a regulator of eIF4E2-directed hypoxic translation. Here, we have identified the DEAD-box protein family member DDX28 as a novel interactor and negative regulator of HIF-2 that suppresses its ability to activate eIF4E2-directed translation.

DDX28 depletion elevated both nuclear and cytoplasmic HIF-2, but HIF-2 transcriptional activity did not increase possibly due to its already high nuclear abundance in hypoxic control cells. Depletion of DDX28 conferred a proliferative advantage to hypoxic, but not normoxic cells, which is likely a consequence of the translational upregulation of a subset of hypoxia-response mRNAs.

Failure to permanently exit the cell cycle can result in cancer and disease. However, the molecular mechanisms and timing that coordinates differentiation commitment and cell cycle exit are not yet understood. Here using adipogenesis as a model system to track differentiation commitment in live cells, we show that a rapid switch mechanism engages exclusively in G1 to trigger a simultaneous commitment to differentiate and permanently exit from the cell cycle. We identify a signal integration mechanism whereby the strengths of both mitogen and differentiation stimuli control a molecular competition between cyclin D1 and PPARG-induced expression of the CDK inhibitor p21 which in turn regulates if and when the differentiation switch is triggered and when the proliferative window closes. In this way, the differentiation control system is able to couple mitogen and differentiation stimuli to sustain a long-term balance between terminally differentiating cells and maintaining the progenitor cell pool, a parameter of critical importance for enabling proper development of tissue domains and organs.

HIGHLIGHTSO_LIProgenitor cells both commit to terminally differentiate and permanently exit the cell cycle at a precise time in G1 as a result of a competition process that can last over multiple cell cycles.
C_LIO_LIPositive-feedback driven expression of PPARG and the parallel induction of p21 triggers a rapid commitment to terminally differentiate and then maintains a postmitotic adipocyte state.
C_LIO_LIOpposing mitogen and adipogenic signals are funneled into a molecular competition in G1 phase that controls if and when cells commit to differentiate, which in turn regulates the number of differentiated cells produced while allowing for the maintenance of sufficient progenitor cells.

In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry revealed that MRGPRX4 is expressed in [~]7% of hDRG neurons and co-localizes with HRH1, a known itch-inducing GPCR. Bile acids elicited a robust Ca2+ response in a subset of cultured hDRG neurons, and intradermal injection of bile acids and an MRGPRX4 specific agonist induced significant itch in healthy human subjects. Surprisingly, application of agonist for TGR5, a known sequence conserved bile acid receptor previously implicated in cholestatic itch, failed to elicit Ca2+ response in cultured hDRG neurons, nor did it induce pruritus in human subjects. In situ hybridization and immunostaining results revealed that hTGR5 is selectively expressed in satellite glial cells, unlike mTGR5 (in mouse DRG neurons), likely accounting for the inter-species difference functionally. Finally, we found that patients with cholestatic itch have significantly higher plasma bile acid levels compared to non-itchy patients and the bile acid levels significantly decreased after itch relief. This elevated bile acid level in itchy patients is sufficient to activate MRGPRX4.

Nonetheless, several reports have also demonstrated flux-independent signaling. Astrocytes express NMDAR distinct from its neuronal counterpart, but cultured astrocytes have no electrophysiological response and controversial findings have questioned NMDAR function. We recently demonstrated that in cultured astrocytes NMDA at pH6 (NMDA/pH&) elicits flux-independent Ca2+ release from the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) and depletes mitochondrial membrane potential (m{Delta}{psi}). Here we show that flux-independent Ca2+ release is mainly due to pH6, whereas m{Delta}{psi} depletion requires both pH6 and flux-dependent NMDAR signaling. Immunofluorescence exhibited that plasma membrane (PM) NMDAR is apposed to ER and mitochondria or surrounds these organelles. Moreover, NMDA/pH6 treatment generated ER stress, increased endocytosis, mitochondria-ER and -nuclear contacts and strikingly, PM invaginations near mitochondria along with electrodense structures referred here as PM-mitochondrial bridges (PM-m-br). These data and earlier observations strongly suggest PM-mitochondria communication. As a proof of concept of this notion, NMDA/pH6 provoked mitochondria labeling by the PM dye FM-4-64FX. Finally, we analyzed by WB NMDAR subunit GluN1 to explore putative causes of NMDAR dual function, we found fragments with M.W. consistent with previously identified cleavage sites. Accordingly, GluN1 intracellular and extracellular domains presented little colocalization. Our findings demonstrate that NMDAR plays a dual function: a flux-independent pH sensor and a flux-dependent regulator of m{Delta}{psi}. More importantly, m{Delta}{psi} depletion seems to be mediated by PM-mitochondria communication.

In Staphylococcus aureus, the enzymes that assemble peptidoglycan move during the cell cycle from the periphery, where they are active during growth, to the division site where they build the partition between daughter cells. But how peptidoglycan synthesis is regulated throughout the cell cycle is not understood. Here we identify a membrane protein complex that spatially regulates S. aureus peptidoglycan synthesis. This complex consists of an amidase that removes peptide chains from uncrosslinked peptidoglycan and a partner protein that controls its activity. Typical amidases act after cell division to hydrolyze peptidoglycan between daughter cells so they can separate. However, we show that this amidase controls cell growth. In its absence, excess peptidoglycan synthesis occurs at the cell periphery, causing cells to grow so large that cell division is defective. We show that cell growth and division defects due to loss of this amidase can be mitigated by attenuating the polymerase activity of the major S. aureus peptidoglycan synthase. Our findings lead to a model wherein the amidase complex regulates the density of peptidoglycan assembly sites to control peptidoglycan synthase activity at a given cellular location. Removal of peptide chains from peptidoglycan at the cell periphery promotes synthase movement to midcell during cell division.

The stimulated contacts were classified as seizure onset zone (SOZ), highly irritative zone (IZp) or control. Response contacts were classified as seizure onset zone (SOZ), active interictal (IZp), quiet or other. The normalized number of responses was defined as the number of contacts with any evoked responses divided by the total number of recorded contacts, and the normalized distance is the ratio of the average distance between the site of stimulation and sites of evoked responses to the average distances between the site of stimulation and all other recording contacts. A new metric we labeled the connectivity index (CI) is defined as the product of the two values.\n\nResults57 stimulation-sessions in 22-patients were analyzed.

Within five years after their introduction, killer shrimp spent much more time hiding in the presence of fish kairomones than when they were exposed to blank water. However, no significant difference was found in aggregation behaviour, and killer shrimp were strongly attracted to the scent of conspecifics regardless of predator threat.

However, deep tissue imaging at the single molecule sensitivity has not been achieved in the NIR-II window due to lack of suitable bio-probes. Single-walled carbon nanotubes have emerged as promising near-infrared luminescent molecular bio-probes; yet, their inefficient photoluminescence (quantum yield [~]1%) drives requirements for sizeable excitation doses ([~]1-10 kW/cm2) that are significantly blue-shifted from the NIR-II region (<850 nm) and may thus ultimately compromise live tissue.

Can we delineate the connectivity between the amygdala subnuclei and occipitotemporal cortex in humans, and will it show similar developmental differences as macaques? If so, what functional regions may be contributing to this pattern of connectivity? To address these questions, we anatomically defined the lateral and basal amygdala subnuclei in 20 adult subjects, 27 kids (aged 7-8), and 15 neonates. We then defined the occipitotemporal region in each individuals native anatomy, and split this entire region into five equal sections from anterior to posterior. We also defined visual functional parcellations in the occipitotemporal cortex (e.g. FFA, PPA) and anatomically defined primary visual cortex (i.e., V1). Using Diffusion Weighted Imaging data, we ran probabilistic tractography with FSL between the amygdala subnuclei as seeds and the occipitotemporal cortical parcellations as targets. Results showed that like macaques, the mean connectivity across subjects to the occipitotemporal cortex significantly decreased on a gradient from anterior to posterior, and that connectivity in kids and neonates was adult-like but became more refined across development. Further, refinement of connectivity to mid and posterior occipitotemporal cortex was largely driven by anterior PPA, LO, and V1, with connectivity to higher order visual areas increasing with age.

It is associated with low socioeconomic status (SES) and responsible for considerable mortality and morbidity. Reports suggest that patients with leishmaniasis may have a higher risk of mental illness (MI), psychosocial morbidity (PM) and reduced quality of life (QoL), but this is not well characterised. The aim of this study was to conduct a systematic review to assess the reported impact of leishmaniasis on mental health and psychosocial wellbeing.\n\nMethodsA systematic review of the literature was carried out. Pre-specified criteria were applied to identify publications including observational quantitative studies or systematic reviews. Two reviewers screened all of the titles, abstracts and full-studies and a third reviewer was consulted for disagreements. Data was extracted from papers meeting the criteria and quality appraisal of the methods was performed using the Newcastle-Ottowa Scale or the Risk of Bias in Systematic Review tool.\n\nResultsA total of 14 studies were identified from 12,517 records. Nine cross-sectional, three case-control, one cohort study and one systematic review were included. Eleven assessed MI outcomes and were measured with tools specifically designed for this; nine measured PM and 12 measured QoL using validated measurement tools. Quality appraisal of the studies showed that six were of good quality. Cutaneous leishmaniasis and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis showed evidence of associated MI and PM including depression, anxiety and stigma, while all forms of disease showed decreased QoL. The findings were used to inform a proposed model and conceptual framework to show the possible links between leishmaniasis and mental health outcomes.\n\nConclusionThere is evidence that leishmaniasis has an impact on MI, PM or QoL of patients and their families and this occurs in all the main subtypes of the disease. There are however large gaps in the evidence. Further research is required to understand the full extent of this problem and its mechanistic basis.\n\nAUTHOR SUMMARYLeishmaniasis is a parasitic disease prevalent in many low-and middle-income countries worldwide. In this study the authors looked for evidence as to whether leishmaniasis affected the mental health and quality of life of patients. To conduct the review, a wide search of the literature was conducted, where a total of 14 full articles were included and analysed. It was found that different forms of leishmaniasis (visceral leishmaniasis, cutaneous leishmaniasis and post kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis) do cause a significant impact on patients mental health and quality of life through societal factors such as stigma, lack of knowledge, culture and low self-esteem among others. However, no evidence of biological mechanisms was found linking leishmaniasis to mental illness or decreased quality of life. Despite being a very incapacitating disease physically, leishmaniasis also leads to mental illness and decreased quality of life, and should therefore be a priority on the global health agenda for both researchers and policy makers.",1,829,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/637132v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/637132v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_637132.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

This is mainly due to the easy reprograming of Cas9 specificity using customizable small non-coding RNAs, and to the ability to target several independent genes simultaneously. Despite these advances, the identification of CRISPR-edited plants remains time and resource consuming. Here, based on the premise that one editing event in one locus is a good predictor of editing event/s in other locus/loci, we developed a CRISPR co-editing selection strategy that greatly facilitates the identification of CRISPR-mutagenized Arabidopsis plants. This strategy is based on targeting the gene/s of interest simultaneously with a proxy of CRISPR-Cas9-directed mutagenesis. The proxy is an endogenous gene whose loss-of-function mutation produces an easy-to-detect visible phenotype that is unrelated to the expected phenotype of the gene/s under study. We tested this strategy via assessing the frequency of co-editing of three functionally unrelated proxies. We found all three proxies predicted the occurrence of mutations in either or both of the other two proxies with efficiencies ranging from 40% to 100%, dramatically reducing the number of plants that need to be screened to identify CRISPR mutants. This selection strategy provides a framework to facilitate gene function studies of gene families as well as the function of single copy genes in polyploid plant species where the identification of multiplex mutants remains challenging.",1,881,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/637314v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/637314v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_637314.txt,1,general-purpose repository,0,supplementary figures available at figshare: tbd figure s1 shows the dna sequence containing the three sgrna and regulatory sequences to target jar1 gl1 and ein2.,NA

However, alternative models have started to emerge, from multiple exponential components to power-law distributions. Here, we present an analytical pipeline with an unbiased model selection approach based on different statistical metrics to determine the model that best explains SMT data. We found that a broad spectrum of TFs (including glucocorticoid receptor, oestrogen receptor, FOXA1, CTCF) follow a power-law distribution, blurring the temporal line between non-specific and specific binding, and suggesting that productive binding may involve longer binding events than previously thought.

So far, there are no explicit methods to find loci implied in buffering mechanisms. However, buffering can be seen as interaction with genetic background. Here we develop this idea into a tractable model for quantitative genetics, in which the buffering effect of one locus with many other loci is condensed into a single (statistical) effect, multiplicative on the total (statistical) additive genetic effect. This allows easier interpretation of the results, and it also simplifies the problem of detecting epistasis from quadratic to linear in the number of loci. Armed with this formulation, we construct a linear model for genome-wide association studies that estimates, and declares significance, of multiplicative epistatic effects at single loci. The model has the form of a variance components, norm reaction model and likelihood ratio tests are used for significance. This model is a generalization and explanation of previous ones. We then test our model using bovine data: Brahman and Tropical Composite animals, phenotyped for body weight at yearling and genotyped up to [~]770,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP). After association analysis and based on False Discovery Rate rules, we find a number of loci with buffering action in one, the other, or both breeds; these loci do not have significant statistical additive effect. Most of these loci have been reported in previous studies, either with an additive effect, or as footprints of selection. We identify epistatic SNPs present in or near genes encoding for proteins that are functionally enriched for peptide activity and transcription factors reported in the context of signatures of selection in multi-breed cattle population studies. These include loci known to be associated with coat color, fertility and adaptation to tropical environments. In these populations we found loci that have a non-significant statistical additive effect but a significant epistatic effect. We argue that the discovery and study of loci associated with buffering effects allows attacking the difficult problems, among others, of release of maintenance variance in artificial and natural selection, of quick adaptation to the environment, and of opposite signs of marker effects in different backgrounds.

These partnerships are sensitive to temperature extremes, which cause symbiont loss and increased coral mortality. Previous studies have implicated host immunity and specifically immunity transcription factor NF-{kappa}B as having a role in the maintenance of the cnidarian-algal symbiosis. Here we have further investigated a possible role for NF-{kappa}B in establishment and loss of symbiosis in various strains of the anemone Exaiptasia (Aiptasia) and in the coral Pocillopora damicornis. Our results show that NF-{kappa}B expression is reduced in Aiptasia larvae and adults that host certain algae strains. Treatment of Aiptasia larvae with a known symbiosis-promoting cytokine, transforming growth factor {beta}, also led to decreased NF-{kappa}B expression. We also show that aposymbiotic Aiptasia (with high NF-{kappa}B expression) have increased survival following infection with the pathogenic bacterium Serratia marcescens as compared to symbiotic Aiptasia (low NF-{kappa}B expression). Furthermore, a P. damicornis coral colony hosting Durusdinium spp. (formerly clade D) symbionts had higher basal NF-{kappa}B expression and decreased heat-induced bleaching as compared to two individuals hosting Cladocopium spp. (formerly clade C) symbionts. Lastly, genome-wide gene expression profiling and genomic promoter analysis identified putative NF-{kappa}B target genes that may be involved in thermal bleaching, symbiont maintenance, and/or immune protection in P. damicornis.

A recent study showed that some subjects with developmental prosopagnosia also have congenital amusia, but problems with music perception have not been described in the acquired variant.\n\nObjectiveOur goal was to determine if music perception was also impaired in subjects with acquired prosopagnosia, and if so, its anatomic correlate.\n\nMethodsWe studied eight subjects with acquired prosopagnosia, all of whom had extensive neuropsychological and neuroimaging testing. They performed a battery of tests evaluating pitch and rhythm processing, including the Montreal Battery for the Evaluation of Amusia.\n\nResultsThree of eight subjects with acquired prosopagnosia had impaired musical pitch perception while rhythm perception was spared. Two of the three also showed reduced musical memory. These three reported alterations in their emotional experience of music: one reported music anhedonia and aversion, while the remaining two had changes consistent with musicophilia. The lesions of these three subjects affected the right or bilateral temporal poles as well as the right amygdala and insula. None of the three prosopagnosic subjects with lesions limited to the inferior occipitotemporal cortex had impaired pitch perception or musical memory, or reported changes in music appreciation.\n\nConclusionTogether with the results of our previous studies of voice recognition, these findings indicate an anterior temporal agnosia syndrome that can include the amnestic variant of prosopagnosia, phonagnosia, and various alterations in music perception, including acquired amusia, reduced musical memory, and altered emotional responses to music.",0,742,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/640748v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/640748v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_640748.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Thermincola potens JR is a promising Gram-positive bacterium to be used in these systems because it is thermophilic. In this paper we describe the structural and functional properties of the nonaheme cytochrome OcwA, which is the terminal reductase of this organism. The structure of OcwA, determined at 2.2[A] resolution shows that the overall-fold and organization of the hemes are not related to other metal reductases and instead are similar to that of multiheme cytochromes involved in the biogeochemical cycles of nitrogen and sulfur. We show that, in addition to solid electron acceptors, OcwA can also reduce soluble electron shuttles and oxyanions. These data reveal that OcwA can take the role of a respiratory  swiss-army knife allowing this organism to grow in environments with rapidly changing availability of terminal electron acceptors without the need for transcriptional regulation and protein synthesis.\n\nImportanceThermophilic Gram-positive organisms were recently shown to be a promising class of organisms to be used in bioelectrochemical systems for the production of electrical energy.

Generally, rice leaf media more effectively increased conidiation than panicle media, and certain non-filtered tissue media were better than their filtered counterparts. Among the tested media, the Indica rice leaf medium with 0.06 g/ml of Wanxian 98 leaf was most efficient for inducing conidiation, and it was also usable for conidiation-defective isolates. Although the conidia induced in rice tissue media were smaller, they were able to germinate on potato sucrose agar medium and infect rice normally.

TRPV1 can be activated by low pH, high temperature or naturally occurring pungent molecules such as allicin, capsaicin or resiniferatoxin. Its noxious thermal sensitivity makes it an important participant as a thermal sensor in mammals. However, details of the mechanism of channel activation by increases in temperature remain unclear. Here we used a combination of approaches to try to understand the role of the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) in channel behavior. First, a computational modeling approach by coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulation of the whole TRPV1 embedded in a phosphatidylcholine (POPC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) membrane provides insight into the dynamics of this channel domain. Global analysis of the structural ensemble shows that the ankyrin repeat domain is a region that sustains high fluctuations during dynamics at different temperatures. We then performed biochemical and thermal stability studies of the purified ARD by means of circular dichroism and tryptophan fluorescence and demonstrate that this region undergoes structural changes at similar temperatures that lead to TRPV1 activation. Our data suggest that the ARD is a dynamic module and that it may participate in controlling the temperature sensitivity of TRPV1.\n\nStatement of SignificanceThis work demonstrates that the temperature-dependent dynamics of the ankyrin repeat domain (ARD) of TRPV1 channels, as probed by coarse-grained molecular dynamics, corresponds to the experimentally determined dynamics of an isolated ARD domain.

Mixed linear mrsodels that identify allele associations to environment, while controlling for genome-wide variation at other loci, have emerged as the method of choice when studying local adaptation. Despite their importance, it is unclear whether this approach performs better than identifying environmentally-associated SNPs without accounting for population structure. To examine this, we first use the mixed linear model GEMMA, and simple Spearman correlations, to identify SNPs showing significant associations to climate with and without accounting for population structure. Subsequently, using Italy and Sweden populations, we compare evidence of allele frequency differentiation (FST), linkage disequilibrium (LD), fitness variation, and functional constraint, underlying these SNPs. Using a lenient cut-off for significance, we find that SNPs identified by both approaches, and SNPs uniquely identified by Spearman correlations, were enriched at sites showing genomic evidence of local adaptation and function but were limited across Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) explaining fitness variation. SNPs uniquely identified by GEMMA, showed no direct or indirect evidence of local adaptation, and no enrichment along putative functional sites. Finally, SNPs that showed significantly high FST and LD, were enriched along fitness QTL peaks and cis-regulatory/nonsynonymous sites showing significant functional constraint. Using these SNPs, we identify genes underlying fitness QTL, and genes linking flowering time to local adaptation.

As a case study, they suggest that one variant of such analyses, the inverted encoding model (IEM) analysis framework, should not be used to assay properties of \""stimulus representations\"" because the ability to apply linear transformations at various stages of the analysis procedure renders results  arbitrary. As we discuss, the specification of all models is arbitrary to the extent that an experimenter makes choices based on current knowledge of the model system. However, the results derived from any given model, such as the reconstructed channel response profiles obtained from an IEM analysis, are uniquely defined and are arbitrary only in the sense that changes in the model can predictably change results. Moreover, with knowledge of the model used for IEM analyses, the results remain informative as comparisons between reconstructed channel response profiles across task conditions using a fixed encoding model - the most common use of the IEM technique - can generally capture changes in population-level representation magnitude across linear transformations. Thus, changes in the magnitude of the response profiles across conditions are preserved, even across unprincipled linear transforms. IEM-based channel response profiles should therefore not be considered arbitrary when the model is clearly specified and guided by our best understanding of neural population representations in the brain regions being analyzed.

While such calls are suspected to serve social function, tracking their exchange among conspecifics and correlating their usage with non-acoustic behavior has proven challenging, given both their relative scarcity in the dolphin repertoire and their characteristic shared use among dolphins, which precludes the unique identification of callers on the basis of whistle properties alone. Towards the goal of robustly identifying the callers of non-signature whistles (equivalently, attributing non-signature whistles to callers), we present a new, long-term audiovisual monitoring system designed for and tested at the Dolphin Discovery exhibit of the National Aquarium in Baltimore, Maryland. In this paper, we confirm the systems ability to spatially localize impulse-like sounds using traditional signal processing approaches that have already been used to localize dolphin echolocation clicks. We go on to provide the first rigorous experimental evaluation of the component time-difference-of-arrival-(TDOA) extraction methods on whistle-like tonal sounds in a (reverberant) aquatic environment, showing that they are generally not suited to sound localization. Nevertheless, we find that TDOA extraction under these circumstances is performed significantly better using a Generalized Cross-Correlation with Phase Transform (GCC-PHAT) method than a standard circular cross-correlation method, a potentially important result.",0,107,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/642736v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/642736v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_642736.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In vulnerable individuals, acute illness can also produce profound, maladaptive, cognitive dysfunction including delirium, but our understanding of delirium pathophysiology remains limited. Here we used bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in C57BL/6J mice and acute hip fracture in humans to address whether disrupted energy metabolism contributes to inflammation-induced behavioral and cognitive changes. LPS (250 g/kg) induced hypoglycemia, which was mimicked by IL-1{beta} (25 g/kg) but not prevented in IL-1RI-/- mice, nor by IL-1RA (10 mg/kg). LPS suppression of locomotor activity correlated with blood glucose concentration, was mitigated by exogenous glucose (2 g/kg) and was exacerbated by 2-deoxyglucose glycolytic inhibition, which prevented IL-1{beta} synthesis. Using the ME7 model of chronic neurodegeneration, to examine vulnerability of the diseased brain to acute stressors, we showed that LPS (100 g/kg) produced acute cognitive dysfunction, selectively in those animals. These acute cognitive impairments were mimicked by insulin (11.5 IU/kg) and mitigated by glucose, demonstrating that acutely reduced glucose metabolism impairs cognition in the vulnerable brain. To test whether these acute changes might predict altered carbohydrate metabolism during delirium, we assessed glycolytic metabolite levels in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in humans during delirium, triggered by acute inflammatory trauma. Hip fracture patients showed elevated CSF lactate and pyruvate during delirium, consistent with altered brain energy metabolism.

Coalescence methods are statistically consistent if certain requirements are met including no intralocus recombination, neutral evolution, and no gene tree reconstruction error. However, the assumption of no intralocus recombination may not hold for many DNA sequence data sets, and neutral evolution is not the rule for genetic markers that are commonly employed in phylogenomic coalescence analyses. Most importantly, the assumption of no gene tree reconstruction error is routinely violated, especially for rapid radiations that are deep in the Tree of Life. With the sequencing of complete genomes and novel pipelines, phylogenetic analysis of retroposon insertions has emerged as a valuable alternative to sequence-based phylogenetic analysis. Retroposon insertions avoid or reduce several problems that beset analysis of sequence data with summary coalescence methods: 1) intralocus recombination is avoided because retroposon insertions are singular evolutionary events, 2) neutral evolution is approximated in many cases, and 3) gene tree reconstruction errors are rare because retroposons have low rates of homoplasy. However, the analysis of retroposons within a multispecies coalescent framework has not been realized. Here, we propose a simple workaround in which a retroposon insertion matrix is first transformed into a series of incompletely resolved gene trees. Next, the program ASTRAL is used to estimate a species tree in the statistically consistent framework of the multispecies coalescent. The inferred species tree includes support scores at all nodes and internal branch lengths in coalescent units. As a test case, we analyzed a retroposon dataset for palaeognath birds (ratites and tinamous) with ASTRAL and compared the resulting species tree to an MP-EST species tree for the same clade derived from thousands of sequence-based gene trees. The MP-EST species tree suggests an empirical case of the  anomaly zone with three very short internal branches at the base of Palaeognathae, and as predicted for anomaly zone conditions, the MP-EST species tree differs from the most common gene tree. Although identical in topology to the MP-EST tree, the ASTRAL species tree based on retroposons shows branch lengths that are much longer and incompatible with anomaly zone conditions. Simulation of gene trees from the retroposon-based species tree reveals that the most common gene tree matches the species tree. We contend that the wide discrepancies in branch lengths between sequence-based and retroposon-based species trees are explained by the greater accuracy of retroposon gene trees (bipartitions) relative to sequence-based gene trees. Coalescence analysis of retroposon data provides a promising alternative to the status quo by reducing gene tree reconstruction error that can have large impacts on both branch length estimates and evolutionary interpretations.",0,804,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/643296v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/643296v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_643296.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

While most work has centered on the skeleton, particularly that of amniotes, the evolutionary origins and molecular underpinnings of the neuromuscular diversity of fish appendages have remained enigmatic. The fundamental pattern of segmentation in amniotes, for example, is that all muscle precursors and spinal nerves enter either the paired appendages or body wall at the same spinal level. The condition in finned vertebrates is not understood. To address this gap in knowledge, we investigated the development of muscles and nerves in unpaired and paired fins of skates and compared them to those of chain catsharks. During skate and shark embryogenesis, cell populations of muscle precursors and associated spinal nerves at the same axial level contribute to both appendages and body wall, perhaps representing an ancestral condition of gnathostome appendicular neuromuscular systems. Remarkably in skates, this neuromuscular bifurcation as well as colinear Hox expression extend posteriorly to pattern a broad paired fin domain. In addition, we identified migratory muscle precursors (MMPs), which are known to develop into paired appendage muscles with Pax3 and Lbx1 gene expression, in the dorsal fins of skates. Our results suggest that muscles of paired fins have evolved via redeployment of the genetic program of MMPs that were already involved in dorsal fin development. Appendicular neuromuscular systems most likely have emerged as side branches of body wall neuromusculature and have been modified to adapt to distinct aquatic and terrestrial habitats.",1,860,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/644062v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/644062v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_644062.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In addition, trafficking of immune cells in the healthy central nervous system (CNS) is tightly regulated by CNS vasculature. In CNS autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (MS), these homeostatic mechanisms are overcome by autoreactive lymphocyte entry into the CNS causing inflammatory demyelinating immunopathology. Previous studies have shown that pericytes regulate the development of organ-specific characteristics of brain vasculature such as the BBB and astrocytic end-feet. Whether pericytes are involved in the control of leukocyte trafficking remains elusive. Using adult, pericyte-deficient mice (Pdgfbret/ret), we show here that brain vasculature devoid of pericytes shows increased expression of VCAM-1 and ICAM-1, which is accompanied by increased leukocyte infiltration of dendritic cells, monocytes and T cells into the brain, but not spinal cord parenchyma. Regional differences enabling leukocyte trafficking into the brain as opposed to the spinal cord inversely correlate with the pericyte coverage of blood vessels. Upon induction of experimental autoimmune encephalitomyelitis (EAE), pericyte-deficient mice succumb to severe neurological impairment. Treatment with first line MS therapy - fingolimod significantly reverses EAE, indicating that the observed phenotype is due to the massive influx of immune cells into the brain. Furthermore, pericyte-deficiency in mice that express myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein peptide (MOG35-55) specific T cell receptor (Pdgfbret/ret; 2D2Tg) leads to the development of spontaneous neurological symptoms paralleled by massive influx of leukocytes into the brain, suggesting altered brain vascular immune quiescence as a prime cause of exaggerated neuroinflammation. Thus, we show that pericytes indirectly restrict immune cell transmigration into the CNS under homeostatic conditions and during autoimmune-driven neuroinflammation by inducing immune quiescence of brain endothelial cells.",1,788,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/644120v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/644120v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_644120.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

R-roscovitine, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor that also inhibits L-type calcium channels, inhibits open hERG channels but does not become trapped in the pore. Two-electrode voltage clamp recordings from Xenopus oocytes expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant (T623A, S624A, Y652A, F656A) hERG channels demonstrated that, compared to WT hERG, T623A, Y652A, and F656A inhibition by 200 M R-roscovitine was ~ 48 %, 29 %, and 73 % weaker, respectively. In contrast, S624A hERG was inhibited more potently than WT hERG, with an ~ 34 % stronger inhibition.

Our purpose was to characterize the known hibernacula in terms of male or female bias, and subsequently compare their population trend during two study periods, between 1930-1980 and 1980-2015. Our findings include evidence of colonisation of winter roosts in formerly unoccupied areas and consequently a change in the migration patterns of the male population of this species. As male bats do not assist to raise their offspring, males have abundant time to restore their energy balance after hibernation. Our results suggest that choosing a hibernacula closer to the summer habitat not only decreases energy cost needed for migration, it also lengthens the mating season and presumably also has the additional advantage of increased paternity.

In order to understand potential functions of these species, we combined 16S rRNA sequencing and shotgun metagenomics to characterize the whole-organism microbiota of Daphnia magna.\n\nResultsFive metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were assembled from the Daphnia magna microbiota. Phylogenetic placement of these MAGs indicated that two belong to the Limnohabitans genus, one to Polaromonas, one to Pedobacter, and one unclassifiable below the Burkholderiaceae family. Average nucleotide identity of these MAGs to their closest sequenced relative was <95%, suggesting these may be new species in known genera. 16S rRNA community profiling shows that the Daphnia magna microbiota is distinct from its culture environment. Genes involved in host colonization and immune system evasion were detected across the MAGs.

Nine young healthy participants walked on a narrow beam. Three-dimensional motion capture was used to calculate the COM and XCOM relative to the base of support. Steps were classified as having either the COM or XCOM inside or outside the base of support, and were classified as successful (stable - foot placed on the beam) or failed (unstable - foot stepped off the beam). If the COM or XCOM are valid measures of stability, they should be within the base of support for successful steps and outside the base of support for failed steps. Classifying the COM and XCOM inside or outside the base of support correctly predicted successful or failed steps in 69% and 58% of cases, respectively. When the COM or XCOM were outside the base of support, walking faster seemed to help participants to maintain stability. The further the COM or XCOM were outside the base of support during a successful step, the more likely participants were to fail on a subsequent step. The results of this study suggest that both COM and XCOM are valid measures of stability during a beam walking task, but that classifying COM and XCOM as inside or outside the base of support may be over-simplistic.",1,603,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/646943v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/646943v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_646943.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We examined the patterns of genetic diversity in Pinus sylvestris, a keystone species in many Eurasian ecosystems with a huge distribution range and decades of forestry research showing that it is locally adapted to the vast range of environmental conditions. Making P. sylvestris an even more attractive subject of local adaptation study, population structure has been shown to be weak previously and in this study. However, little is known about the molecular genetic basis of adaptation, as the massive size of gymnosperm genomes has prevented large scale genomic surveys. We generated a both geographically and genomically extensive dataset using a targeted sequencing approach. By applying divergence-based and landscape genomics methods we found that several coding loci contribute to local adaptation. We also discovered a very large (ca. 300 Mbp) putative inversion with a signal of local adaptation, which to our knowledge is the first such discovery in conifers. Our results call for more detailed analysis of structural variation in relation to genomic basis of local adaptation, emphasize the lack of large effect loci contributing to local adaptation in the coding regions and thus point out to the need for more attention towards multi-locus analysis of polygenic adaptation.",1,85,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/647412v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/647412v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_647412.txt,1,general-purpose repository,0,scripts and relevant output files are accessible at dryad (tba) (tyrmi et al.,NA

One way to investigate the behavioral mechanisms underlying ecological novelty is by comparing prey capture kinematics between groups. In this study, we investigated the contribution of kinematics to the origins of a novel ecological niche for scale-eating within a microendemic adaptive radiation of pupfishes on San Salvador Island, Bahamas. We compared prey capture kinematics across three species of pupfish while consuming shrimp and scales in the lab and found that scale-eating pupfish exhibited peak gape sizes that were twice as large as all other groups, but also attacked prey with a more obtuse angle between their lower jaw and suspensorium. We then investigated how this variation in feeding kinematics could explain scale-biting performance by measuring the surface area removed per strike from standardized gelatin cubes. We found that a combination of larger peak gape and more obtuse lower jaw and suspensorium angles resulted in 67% more surface area removed per strike, indicating that scale-eaters may reside on a performance optimum for scale-biting. We also measured feeding kinematics of F1 hybrids to test whether feeding performance could contribute to reproductive isolation between species and found that F1 hybrid kinematics and performance more closely resembled those of generalists, suggesting that they may have low fitness in the scale-eating niche.

We found that transcriptional bursting can explain frequent observations of autosomal monoallelic gene expression in cells. Importantly, the burst frequency largely determined the fraction of cells with monoallelic expression, whereas both burst frequency and size contributed to allelic imbalance. Allelic observations deviate from the expected when analysed across heterogeneous groups of cells, suggesting that allelic modelling can provide an unbiased assessment of heterogeneity within cells.

A major factor in the virulence of EEEV is the presence of four binding sites for the hematopoietic cell-specific microRNA, miR-142-3p, in the 3 untranslated region (3 UTR) of the virus. Three of the sites are \""canonical\"" with all 8 seed sequence residues complimentary to miR-142-3p while one is \""non-canonical\"" and has a seed sequence mismatch. Interaction of the EEEV genome with miR-142-3p limits virus replication in myeloid cells and suppresses the systemic innate immune response, greatly exacerbating EEEV neurovirulence. The presence of the miRNA binding sequences is also required for efficient EEEV replication in mosquitoes and, therefore, essential for transmission of the virus. In the current studies, we have examined the role of each binding site by point mutagenesis of seed sequences in all combinations of sites followed by infection of mammalian myeloid cells, mosquito cells and mice. The resulting data indicate that both canonical and non-canonical sites contribute to cell infection and animal virulence, however, surprisingly, all sites are rapidly deleted from EEEV genomes shortly after infection of myeloid cells or mice. Finally, we show that the virulence of a related encephalitis virus, western equine encephalitis virus, is also dependent upon miR-142-3p binding sites.\n\nAuthor SummaryEastern equine encephalitis virus (EEEV) is one of the most acutely virulent mosquito-borne viruses in the Americas. A major determinant of EEEV virulence is a mammalian microRNA (miRNA) that is primarily expressed in myeloid cells, miR-142-3p. Like miRNA suppression of host mRNA, miR-142-3p binds to the 3 untranslated region (UTR) of the EEEV genome only in myeloid cells suppressing virus replication and the induction of the innate immune response. In this study, we used point mutations in all four miR-142-3p binding sites in the EEEV 3 UTR to understand the mechanism behind this miRNA suppression. We observed that decreasing the number of miR-142-3p binding sites leads to virus escape and ultimately attenuation in vivo. Furthermore, another virus, western equine encephalitis virus, also encodes miR-142-3p binding sites that contribute to virulence in vivo. These results provide insight into the mechanism of how cell-specific miRNAs can mediate suppression of virus replication.",1,734,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/649525v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/649525v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_649525.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Because circulating levels of GCs increase in response to challenges, within-population variation in GCs could reflect individual variation in condition or experience. At the same time, individual variation in the degree to which GCs increase in response to challenges (which is relatively consistent within individuals over time) could have causal effects on stress coping capacity, and the ability to survive and reproduce. Although a number of studies in vertebrates have tested whether within-population variation in GCs predicts components of fitness, it is not clear whether there are consistent patterns across taxa. Here we present the first phylogenetic meta-analysis testing whether within-population variation in GCs is associated with components of fitness across vertebrates. At the same time, we introduce and test predictions about an overlooked but potentially important mediator of GC-fitness relationships: life history context. We suggest that strong context-dependence in the fitness benefit of maintaining elevated GCs could obscure consistent patterns between GCs and fitness across taxa. Meta-analyses revealed that across vertebrates, baseline and stress-induced GCs were consistently negatively correlated with reproductive success. This relationship did not differ depending on life history context. In contrast, the relationships between GCs and survival were highly context dependent, differing according to life history strategy. Both baseline and stress-induced GCs were more strongly negatively associated with survival in longer-lived populations and species. Stress-induced GCs were also more negatively associated with survival in organisms that engage in relatively more valuable reproductive attempts. Fecal GCs did not predict survival or reproductive success. We also used a meta-analytic approach to test whether experimental increases in GCs had consistent causal effects on fitness. Experimental increases in GCs reduced both survival and reproductive success, although the latter relationship was not significant when accounting for phylogeny. Overall, these results support the prediction that GC-fitness relationships can be strongly context dependent, and suggest that incorporating life history may be particularly important for understanding GC-survival relationships. Future studies that explore the role of other aspects of context (e.g., the nature and frequency of stressors, environmental variation) within and across species could provide important insights how and when variation in GC regulation predicts fitness.",1,638,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/649608v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/649608v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_649608.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Indeed, in such case, algorithmic convergence criteria are more difficult to set up. Moreover, the size of the search space makes it difficult to achieve a complete exploration. The interval Branch-and-Prune (iBP) approach, based on the reformulating of the Distance Geometry Problem (DGP) provides a theoretical frame for the generation of protein conformations, by systematically sampling the conformational space. When an appropriate subset of inter-atomic distances is known exactly, this worst-case exponential-time algorithm is provably complete and fixed-parameter tractable. These guarantees, however, immediately disappear as distance measurement errors are introduced. Here we propose an improvement of this approach: the threading-augmented interval Branch-and-Prune (TAiBP), where the combinatorial explosion of the original iBP approach arising from its exponential complexity is alleviated by partitioning the input instances into consecutive peptide fragments and by using Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) to obtain clusters of similar solutions. A validation of the TAiBP approach is presented here on a set of proteins of various sizes and structures. The calculation inputs are: a uniform covalent geometry extracted from force field covalent terms, the backbone dihedral angles with error intervals, and a few long-range distances. For most of the proteins smaller than 50 residues and interval widths of 20{degrees}, the TAiBP approach yielded solutions with RMSD values smaller than 3 [A] with respect to the initial protein conformation. The efficiency of TAiBP approach for proteins larger than 50 residues will require the use of non-uniform covalent geometry, and may have benefits from the recent development of residue-specific force-fields.",1,142,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/650903v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/650903v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_650903.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The modular structure of the representation confers the grid cell neural code with large capacity. Yet, the modularity poses significant challenges for the neural circuitry that maintains the representation, and updates it based on self motion. Small incompatible drifts in different modules, driven by noise, can rapidly lead to large, abrupt shifts in the represented position, resulting in catastrophic readout errors. Here we propose a theoretical model of coupled modules. The coupling suppresses incompatible drifts, allowing for a stable embedding of a two dimensional variable (position) in a higher dimensional neural attractor, while preserving the large capacity. We propose that coupling of this type may be implemented by recurrent synaptic connectivity within the mEC with a relatively simple and biologically plausible structure.",1,811,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/651513v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/651513v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_651513.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Identifying copy number-derived miRNA-target gene regulatory interactions in cancer could shed some light on biological mechanisms in tumor initiation and progression. In the present study, we developed a computational pipeline, called miRDriver which is based on the hypothesis that copy number data from cancer patients can be utilized to discover driver miRNAs of cancer. miRDriver integrates copy number aberration, DNA methylation, gene and miRNA expression datasets to compute copy number-derived miRNA-gene interactions in cancer. We tested miRDriver on breast cancer and ovarian cancer data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. miRDriver discovered some of the known miRNAs, such as miR-125b, mir-320d, let-7g, and miR-21, which are known to be in copy number aberrated regions in breast cancer. We also discovered some potentially novel miRNA-gene interactions. Also, several miRNAs such as miR-127, miR-139 and let-7b were found to be associated with tumor survival and progression based on Cox proportional hazard model.

In this study, we investigated the ischemic penumbras capacity to respond to somatosensory input. We examined adult (3- to 4-month-old) and old (18- to 24-month-old) male mice at 2-4 hours after MCAO, using two-photon microscopy to record somatosensory stimulation-induced neuronal and astrocytic Ca2+ signals in the ischemic penumbra.

Most methods for minimizer schemes use randomized (or close to randomized) ordering of k-mers when finding minimizers, but recent work has shown that not all non-lexicographic orderings perform the same. One way to find k-mer orderings for minimizer schemes is through the use of universal k-mer sets, which are subsets of k-mers that are guaranteed to cover all windows. The smaller this set the fewer false positives (where two poorly aligned sequences being identified as possible matches) are identified. Current methods for creating universal k-mer sets are limited in the length of the k-mer that can be considered, and cannot compute sets in the range of lengths currently used in practice. We take some of the first steps in creating universal k-mer sets that can be used to construct minimizer orders for large values of k that are practical. We do this using iterative extension of the k-mers in a set, and guided contraction of the set itself.

Furthermore, cell disparity within S. rosetta colonies is higher compared to cell disparity within sponge choanocytes.

Hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure [&ge;]140mmHG or diastolic blood pressure [&ge;]90. Obesity was defined as body mass index >30 kg/m2. Frequent alcohol consumption was defined as alcohol use 3 or more times a week. Multivariable log binomial regression analysis was carried out for each of the two outcome variables against age group and controlled for frequency of alcohol consumption and few other independent factors. Non-parametric tests were used to compare trends of prevalence ratios across age groups. Modified Poisson regression was use in few instances when the model failed to converge.\n\nResultsThe results showed increasing trend in the prevalence of hypertension and frequent alcohol consumption but a declining trend for obesity along different age groups (p<0.01). Frequency of alcohol consumption did not significantly modify the age group-hypertension and age group-obesity relationships although the effect was significant with ungrouped age. There was significance in difference of fitted lines for hypertension prevalence ratios between frequent drinkers and mild drinkers and between abstainers and frequent drinkers. Alcohol consumption did not have any significant effect on obesity-age group relationship.\n\nConclusionThe results call for more research to understand the effect of alcohol on the hypertension-age relationship, and the obesity-age relationship.

However, redundancy among the two mammalian family members and the position of the Drosophila gene on the fourth chromosome precluded assessment of Crks full role in embryogenesis. We circumvented these limitations with shRNA and CRISPR technology to assess Crks function in Drosophila morphogenesis. We found Crk is essential beginning in the first few hours of development, where it ensures accurate mitosis by regulating orchestrated dynamics of the actin cytoskeleton to keep mitotic spindles in syncytial embryos from colliding. In this role, it positively regulates levels of the Arp2/3 complex, its regulator SCAR, and F-actin in actin caps and pseudocleavage furrows. Crk loss leads to loss of nuclei and formation of multinucleate cells. We also found roles for Crk in embryonic wound healing and in axon patterning in the nervous system, where it localizes to the axons and midline glia.

Here, we tested (p)ppGpp and codY mutant strains of Enterococcus faecalis in a catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTI) mouse model and used global transcriptional analysis to investigate the (p)ppGpp and CodY relationship. Absence of (p)ppGpp or single inactivation of codY led to lower bacterial loads in catheterized bladders, and diminished biofilm formation on fibrinogen-coated surfaces under in vitro and in vivo conditions. Single inactivation of the bifunctional (p)ppGpp synthetase/hydrolase rel did not affect virulence supporting previous evidence that association of (p)ppGpp with enterococcal virulence is not dependent on activation of the stringent response. Inactivation of codY in the (p)ppGpp0 strain restored E. faecalis virulence in the CAUTI model as well as the ability to form biofilms in vitro. Transcriptome analysis revealed that inactivation of codY restores, for the most part, the dysregulated metabolism of (p)ppGpp0 cells. While a clear linkage between (p)ppGpp and CodY with expression of virulence factors could not be established, targeted transcriptional analysis indicate that a possible association between (p)ppGpp and c-di-AMP signaling pathways in response to the conditions found in the bladder may plays a role in enterococcal CAUTI.

However, the genetic variation responsible for these gene expression changes remain largely unknown. Among the non-coding variants that could be relevant, transposable element insertions are promising candidates as they have been shown to be a rich and diverse source of cis-regulatory elements.

ResultsIn this work, we used a population genetics approach to identify transposable element insertions likely to increase the tolerance of Drosophila melanogaster to bacterial infection by affecting the expression of immune-related genes. We identified 12 insertions associated with allele-specific expression changes in immune-related genes. We experimentally validated three of these insertions including one likely to be acting as a silencer, one as an enhancer, and one with a dual role as enhancer and promoter. The direction in the change of gene expression associated with the presence of several of these insertions was consistent with an increased survival to infection. Indeed, for one of the insertions, we showed that this is the case by analyzing both natural populations and CRISPR/Cas9 mutants in which the insertion was deleted from its native genomic context.

ConclusionsWe showed that transposable elements contribute to gene expression variation in response to infection in D. melanogaster and that this variation is likely to affect their survival capacity. Because the role of transposable elements as regulatory elements is not restricted to Drosophila, TEs are likely to play a role in immune response in other organisms as well.",0,509,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/655225v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/655225v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_655225.txt,1,data availability statement,0,availability of data and materials all data generated or analysed during this study are included in this published article [and its supplementary information files]. competing interests 29   biorxiv preprint doi,NA

Joint analysis of behavioral error patterns and neural decision signal dynamics indicated that subjects systematically began the accumulation process before any informative evidence was presented, and further, that accumulation onset timing varied systematically as a function of the foreperiod of the preceding trial.

To test this hypothesis, we analyzed short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) and mucin components in the stool samples of 40 healthy subjects, 49 ulcerative colitis (UC) patients, and 44 Crohns disease (CD) patients from Japan. The levels of n-butyrate were significantly lower in the stools of both the CD and UC patients than in those of the healthy subjects. Correlation analysis identified 7 bacterial species positively correlated with n-butyrate levels, among which the major n-butyrate producer, Faecalibacterium prausnitzii, was particularly underrepresented in CD patients, but not in UC patients. In UC patients, there were inverse correlations between mucin O-glycan levels and the production of SCFAs, such as n-butyrate, suggesting that mucin O-glycans act as an endogenous fermentation substrate for n-butyrate production. Indeed, mucin-fed rodents exhibited enhanced n-butyrate production, leading to the expansion of RORgt+Treg cells and IgA-producing cells in the colonic lamina propria.

It infects many species of animals including wildlife, and people may get exposed through direct contact with an infected animal or consumption of raw or undercooked animal products. We implemented a linked livestock-human cross-sectional study to determine seroprevalences and risk factors of Brucella spp. in livestock and humans. We also estimated intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICCs) for these observations at the household and village levels.\n\nMethodologyThe study was implemented in Garissa County (specifically Ijara and Sangailu areas) and Tana River (Bura and Hola) counties. A household was the unit of analysis and the sample size was derived using the standard procedures. Serum samples were obtained from selected livestock and people from randomly selected households. Humans were sampled in both counties while livestock could be sampled only in Tana River County. Samples obtained were screened for anti-Brucella IgG antibodies using ELISA kits. Data were analyzed using generalized linear mixed effects logistic regression models with the household (herd) and village being used as random effects.\n\nResultsThe overall seroprevalences were 3.47% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.72 - 4.36%) and 35.81% (95% CI: 32.87 - 38.84) in livestock and humans, respectively. In livestock, older animals and those sampled in Hola had significantly higher seroprevalences that younger ones or those sampled in Bura. Herd and village random effects were significant and ICC estimates associated with these variables were 0.40 (95% CI: 0.22 - 0.60) and 0.24 (95% CI: 0.08 - 0.52), respectively. For human data, older people, males, and people who lived in pastoral areas had significantly higher Brucella spp. seroprevalences than younger ones, females or those who lived in irrigated or riverine areas. People from households that had at least one seropositive animal were 3.35 (95% CI: 1.51 - 7.41) times more likely to be seropositive compared to those that did not. Human exposures significantly clustered at the household level; the ICC estimate obtained was 0.21 (95% CI: 0.06 - 0.52).\n\nConclusionThe presence of a seropositive animal in a household significantly increased the risk of exposure in people in that household. Brucella spp. exposures in both livestock and humans clustered significantly at the household level. This suggests that risk-based surveillance measures, guided by locations of primary cases reported, either in humans or livestock, can be used to detect Brucella spp. infections livestock or humans, respectively.\n\nAuthor summaryBrucellosis is an important zoonotic disease that primarily affects livestock and wildlife. In humans, the disease is characterized by prolonged fever, body aches, joint pains and weakness while in livestock, the disease causes abortions and infertility. We carried out a study in northeastern Kenya (Garissa and Tana River Counties) to identify factors that affect the distribution of the disease in people and livestock. Livestock and people from randomly selected households were recruited and serum samples obtained for screening using anti-Brucella IgG ELISA kits to determine their Brucella spp. exposure. Data obtained were analyzed using mixed effects logistic regression models. Results obtained show that human and animal Brucella spp. seroprevalences cluster at the household level. The odds of exposure in humans were at least three times higher in households that had at least one seropositive animal compared to those that did not. These results can be used to design risk-based surveillance systems where each Brucella infection identified in livestock or humans could signal potential locations of other secondary infections.",1,731,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/658864v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/658864v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_658864.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We discovered a critical role for nucleotides at the 3-end of the catalytic U6 small nuclear RNA in splicing termination.

While the 3-end of U6 is not required for recruiting Prp43 to the spliceosome, the 3 end crosslinks directly to Prp43 in an RNA-dependent manner. Our data indicate a mechanism of splicing termination in which Prp43 translocates along U6 from the 3 end to disassemble the spliceosome and thereby release suboptimal substrates or excised introns.

SOCE refers to influx of Ca2+ into cells that is activated by depletion of endoplasmic or sarcoplasmic reticulum stores (ER/SR) Ca2+ stores. In the SOCE pathway, STIM proteins function as Ca2+ sensors in the ER, and upon ER Ca2+ store depletion STIM rearranges to ER-plasma membrane junctions where it activates Orai Ca2+ influx channels. Multiple studies have implicated STIM and Orai mediated SOCE in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy. Importantly however, the functional roles of SOCE in normal heart physiology have not been well defined. We have addressed this in Drosophila melanogaster, a powerful animal model of cardiac development and physiology. We show that heart specific suppression of Drosophila Stim and Orai resulted in reduced contractility consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy, characterized by increased end diastolic and end systolic dimensions and decreased fractional shortening. Reduced contractility was apparent in larval hearts and became more pronounced in adults. Myofibers were disorganized and more widely spaced in larval and adult hearts with Stim and Orai RNAi as compared to controls, possibly reflecting decompensation or upregulated stress response signaling due to altered Ca2+ homeostasis. Lastly, we show that reduced heart function significantly affected animal health and viability, as animals with heart specific Stim and Orai suppression exhibited significant delays in post-embryonic development and adults died significantly earlier than controls. Collectively, our results demonstrate that SOCE is essential for normal heart physiology and establish Drosophila as an important model for delineation of functional SOCE roles in cardiomyocytes.",1,105,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/659136v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/659136v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_659136.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Characterizing species that grow in harsh conditions could enable the design of more robust yeast strains for biotechnology. However, tolerance to stressful conditions is a multifactorial response, which is difficult to understand since many of the genes involved are as yet uncharacterized. In this work, three divergent yeast species were grown under multiple stressful conditions to identify stress-induced genes. For each condition, duplicated and non-conserved genes were significantly enriched for stress responsiveness compared to single-copy conserved genes. To understand this further, we developed a sorting method that considers evolutionary origin and duplication timing to assign an evolutionary age to each gene. Subsequent analysis of the sets of genes that changed expression revealed a relationship between stress-induced genes and the youngest gene set, regardless of the species or stress in question. These young genes are rarely essential for growth and evolve rapidly, which may facilitate their functionalization for stress tolerance and may explain their stress-induced expression. These findings show that systems-level analyses that consider gene age can expedite the identification of stress tolerance genes.",1,99,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/660274v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/660274v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_660274.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Specific somatic MEIs have been detected at high levels in human cancers2, and at lower to medium levels in human brains3. Dysregulation of somatic retrotransposition in the human brain has been hypothesized to contribute to neuropsychiatric diseases4, 5. However, individual somatic MEIs are present in small proportions of cells at a given anatomical location, and thus standard whole-genome sequencing (WGS) presents a difficult signal-to-noise problem, while single-cell approaches suffer from limited scalability and experimental artifacts introduced by enzymatic whole-genome amplification6. Previous studies produced widely differing estimates for the somatic retrotransposition rates in human brain3, 6-8. Here, we present a highly precise machine learning method (RetroSom) to directly identify somatic L1 and Alu insertions in <1% cells from 200x deep WGS, which allows circumventing the restrictions of whole-genome amplification. Using RetroSom we confirmed a lower rate of retrotransposition for individual somatic L1 insertions in human neurons. We discovered that anatomical distribution of somatic L1 insertion is as widespread in glia as in neurons, and across both hemispheres of the brain, indicating retrotransposition occurs during early embryogenesis. We characterized two of the detected brain-specific L1 insertions in great detail in neurons and glia from a donor with schizophrenia. Both insertions are within introns of genes active in brain (CNNM2, FRMD4A) in regions with multiple genetic associations with neuropsychiatric disorders9-11. Gene expression was significantly reduced by both somatic insertions in a reporter assay. Our results provide novel insights into the potential for pathological effects of somatic retrotransposition in the human brain, now including the large glial fraction.

Here, we propose using a machine-learning approach, called classification, to objectively evaluate auditory perception. In this study, we recorded frequency following responses (FFRs) from 13 normal-hearing adult participants to six short music and speech stimuli sharing similar fundamental frequencies but varying in overall spectral and temporal characteristics. Each participant completed a perceptual identification test using the same stimuli. We used linear discriminant analysis to classify FFRs. Results showed statistically significant FFR classification accuracies using both the full response epoch in the time domain (72.3% accuracy, p < 0.001) as well as real and imaginary Fourier coefficients up to 1 kHz (74.6%, p < 0.001). We classified decomposed versions of the responses in order to examine which response features contributed to successful decoding. Classifier accuracies using Fourier magnitude and phase alone in the same frequency range were lower but still significant (58.2% and 41.3% respectively, p < 0.001). Classification of overlapping 20-msec subsets of the FFR in the time domain similarly produced reduced but significant accuracies (42.3%-62.8%, p < 0.001). Participants mean perceptual responses were most accurate (90.6%, p < 0.001). Confusion matrices from FFR classifications and perceptual responses were converted to distance matrices and visualized as dendrograms. FFR classifications and perceptual responses demonstrate similar patterns of confusion across the stimuli. Our results demonstrate that classification can differentiate auditory stimuli from FFR responses with high accuracy. Moreover, the reduced accuracies obtained when the FFR is decomposed in the time and frequency domains suggest that different response features contribute complementary information, similar to how the human auditory system is thought to rely on both timing and frequency information to accurately process sound.

We show that a computational framework incorporating dimension expansion and a specific form of sparse coding can capture structures that contain maximum information about specific objects, allow redundancy coding, and enable consistent representation of object identities.

Local adaptation in Heliconius butterflies is linked to microhabitat use and the colourful wing colour patterns may be adapted for signalling in different light environments. These toxic butterflies exhibit conspicuous colours as a warning to predators that they should be avoided, but also find and choose potential mates based on colour signals. The two selection pressures of predation and mate preference are therefore acting together. Colour conspicuousness should show habitat-specific contrast for the butterflies, which would facilitate detection and species identification. On the other hand, selection for signal stability would be stronger in the avian visual system. In this study we analysed the contrast of two Heliconius mimicry rings in their natural habitats under varying degrees of forest fragmentation and light conditions. We used digital image analyses and mapped the bird and butterfly vision colour space in order to examine whether warning colours have greater contrast and if they transmit a consistent signal across time of the day and habitat in a tropical forest. We tested conspicuousness using opponent colour channels against a natural green background. For avian vision, colours are generally very stable through time and habitat. For butterfly vision, there is some evidence that species are more contrasting in their own habitats, where conspicuousness is higher for red and yellow bands in the border and for white in the forest. Light environment affects Heliconius butterflies warning signal transmission to a higher degree through their own vision, but to a lesser degree through avian predator vision.

In addition, the obligate haploidy of males makes these wasps a uniquely powerful model for analyzing the role of complex gene interactions in development and evolution. Previous analyses have shown that complex gene interactions underpin different aspects of the shape differences, and developmental incompatibilities that are specific to the head in F2 haploid hybrid males are also governed by networks of gene interaction. Here we use the genetic tools available in Nasonia to extend our understanding of the gene interactions that affect development and morphogenesis in male heads. Using artificial diploid male hybrids, we show that alleles affecting head shape are codominant, leading to uniform, averaged hybrid F1 diploid male heads, while the alleles mediating developmental defects are recessive, and are not visible in the diploid hybrids. We also determine that divergence in time, rather than in morphological disparity is the primary driver of hybrid developmental defects. In addition, we show that doublesex is necessary for the male head shape differences, but is not the only important factor.

However, proper cryopreservation techniques have not been established yet.\n\nMethodsWe evaluated the post-thaw viability and ADSC functions after cryopreservation with three cryoprotectants (serum containing 10% dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), serum-free: CP-1TM, DMSO-free: SCB-DFTM) at two temperature (-80{degrees}C, -150{degrees}C) and two cell densities: (1 x 106, 7 x 106 cells/mL) for up to 18 months using cryovials.

Penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) were long considered as the key peptidoglycan synthesizing enzymes in these complexes. Among these were the bifunctional class A PBPs, which are both glycosyltransferases and transpeptidases, and monofunctional class B PBPs with only transpeptidase activity. Recently, however, it was established that the monofunctional class B PBPs work together with non-PBP glycosyltransferases (FtsW and RodA) to make up the core peptidoglycan synthesizing machineries within the pneumococcal divisome (FtsW/PBP2x) and elongasome (RodA/PBP2b). The function of class A PBPs is therefore now an open question. Here we utilize the peptidoglycan hydrolase CbpD to show that class A PBPs have an autonomous role during cell wall synthesis in S. pneumoniae. Purified CbpD was shown to target the septum of S. pneumoniae cells. Using assays to specifically inhibit PBP2x, we demonstrate that CbpD specifically target nascent peptidoglycan synthesized by the divisome. Notably, class A PBPs could process this nascent peptidoglycan from a CbpD-sensitive to a CbpD-resistant form. The class A PBP mediated processing was independent of divisome and elongasome activities. Class A PBPs thus constitute an autonomous functional entity which processes or repairs nascent peptidoglycan synthesized by FtsW/PBP2x. Our results support a model in which pneumococcal peptidoglycan is made by three functional entities, the divisome, the elongasome and a peptidoglycan-repairing or -remodelling complex consisting of bifunctional PBPs.

Towards addressing this, we developed sci-fate, a new technique that combines S4U labeling of newly synthesized mRNA with single cell combinatorial indexing (sci-), in order to concurrently profile the whole and newly synthesized transcriptome in each of many single cells. As a proof-of-concept, we applied sci-fate to a model system of cortisol response and characterized expression dynamics in over 6,000 single cells. From these data, we quantify the dynamics of the cell cycle and glucocorticoid receptor activation, while also exploring their intersection.

Here, we used a developmental dataset (ages 5-21, N=348) from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) Initiative to directly compare two widely used MRI structural sequences: one based on the Human Connectome Project (MPRAGE) and another based on the ABCD study (MPRAGE+PMC). We aimed to determine if the morphometric measurements obtained from both protocols are equivalent or if one sequence has a clear advantage over the other. The sequences were also compared through quality control measurements. Inter- and intra-sequence reliability were assessed with another set of participants (N=71) from HBN that performed two MPRAGE and two MPRAGE+PMC sequences within the same imaging session, with one MPRAGE (MPRAGE1) and MPRAGE+PMC (MPRAGE+PMC1) pair at the beginning of the session and another pair (MPRAGE2 and MPRAGE+PMC2) at the end of the session. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) scores for morphometric measurements such as volume and cortical thickness showed that intra-sequence reliability is the highest with the two MPRAGE+PMC sequences and lowest with the two MPRAGE sequences. Regarding inter-sequence reliability, ICC scores were higher for the MPRAGE1 - MPRAGE+PMC1 pair at the beginning of the session than the MPRAGE1 - MPRAGE2 pair, possibly due to the higher motion artifacts in the MPRAGE2 run. Results also indicated that the MPRAGE+PMC sequence is robust, but not impervious, to high head motion. For quality control metrics, the traditional MPRAGE yielded better results than MPRAGE+PMC in 5 of the 8 measurements. In conclusion, morphometric measurements evaluated here showed high inter-sequence reliability between the MPRAGE and MPRAGE+PMC sequences, especially in images with low head motion. We suggest that studies targeting hyperkinetic populations use the MPRAGE+PMC sequence, given its robustness to head motion and higher reliability scores. However, neuroimaging researchers studying non-hyperkinetic participants can choose either MPRAGE or MPRAGE+PMC sequences, but should carefully consider the apparent tradeoff between relatively increased reliability, but reduced quality control metrics when using the MPRAGE+PMC sequence.",1,87,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666289v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666289v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_666289.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Co-translational folding mechanisms are therefore linked to elongation rate, which varies as a function of synonymous codon usage. However, synonymous codon substitutions can affect many distinct cellular processes, which has complicated attempts to deconvolve the extent to which synonymous codon usage can promote or frustrate proper protein folding in vivo. Although previous studies have shown that some synonymous changes can lead to different final structures, other substitutions will likely be more subtle, perturbing predominantly the protein folding pathway without radically altering the final structure. Here we show that synonymous codon substitutions encoding a single essential enzyme lead to dramatically slower cell growth. These mutations do not prevent active enzyme formation; instead, they predominantly alter the protein folding mechanism, leading to enhanced degradation in vivo. These results support a model where synonymous codon substitutions can impair cell fitness by significantly perturbing co-translational protein folding mechanisms, despite the chaperoning provided by the cellular protein homeostasis network.\n\nSignificanceMany proteins that are incapable of refolding in vitro nevertheless fold efficiently to their native state in the cell. This suggests that more information than the amino acid sequence is required to properly fold these proteins. Here we show that synonymous mRNA mutations can alter a protein folding mechanism in vivo, leading to changes in cellular fitness. This work demonstrates that synonymous codon selection can play an important role in supporting efficient protein production in vivo.",1,114,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666552v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666552v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_666552.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

A total of 56 mutations, including 24 single nucleotide variations, 23 deletions, and 5 insertions, were detected in five mutant rice lines (two dwarf and three early-heading-date mutants). The mutations were distributed among all 12 chromosomes, and the average mutation frequency in the M1 generation was estimated to be 2.7 x 10-7 per base. Many single base insertions and deletions were associated with homopolymeric repeats, whereas larger deletions up to seven base pairs were observed at polynucleotide repeats in the DNA sequences of the mutation sites.

BLV has spread worldwide and causes a serious problem for the cattle industry. The cellular receptor specifically binds with viral envelope glycoprotein (Env) and this attachment mediates cell fusion to lead virus entry. BLV Env reportedly binds to cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1)/SLC7A1, but whether the CAT1/SLC7A1 is an actual receptor for BLV remains unknown. Here, we showed that CAT1 functioned as an infection receptor, interacting with BLV particles. Cells expressing undetectable CAT1 levels were resistant to BLV infection but became highly susceptible upon CAT1 overexpression. CAT1 exhibited specific binding to BLV particles on the cell surface and co-localized with the Env in endomembrane compartments and membrane. Knockdown of CAT1 in permissive cells significantly reduced binding to BLV particles and BLV infection. In addition, bovine serum with neutralizing activity from a BLV-infected cattle inhibited BLV particles. Expression of CAT1 from various species demonstrated no species-specificity for BLV infection, implicating CAT1 as a functional BLV receptor responsible for its broad host range. These findings provide insights for BLV infection and for developing new strategies for treating BLV and preventing its spread.\n\nAuthor SummaryBovine leukemia virus (BLV), which can infect a variety of animal species and induce lymphoma in cattle, is a member of the family Retroviridae. BLV induces huge economic losses by not only lymphoma but also subclinical forms of the disease. In addition, BLV is frequently used as an animal model of human T-cell leukemia virus (HTLV), as BLV has many similar characteristics to HTLV. Thus, understanding BLV pathogenesis contribute to resolve not only BLV-but also HTLV-induced problems. Retroviral envelope glycoprotein (Env) is specifically recognized by the cellular receptor at cell surface, which induces a conformational changes between viral and cell membrane to entry. Thus, the elucidation of cellular receptor for BLV infection is very important for virus entry. However, the BLV receptor has not been identified yet. In the current study, we found that BLV Env protein binds to cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1)/SLC7A1 at cell surface, artificial expression of CAT1 in CAT1-negative cells confers the cells susceptible to BLV infection, and CAT1-silencing significantly reduces BLV infection, concluding that CAT1 is the BLV receptor. These findings will have far reaching great advantages of insights in the retrovirus study.",1,836,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666958v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/666958v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_666958.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We have developed a computational method for accurate prospective prediction of outer-membrane uptake of drug-like molecules, which we combine with a new medium-throughput experimental assay. Parallel molecular dynamics simulations are used to successfully and quantitatively predict experimental permeabilities. For most polar molecules we test, outer membrane permeability also correlates well with whole-cell uptake. The ability to accurately predict and measure outer-membrane uptake of a wide variety of small molecules will enable simpler determination of which molecular scaffolds and which derivatives are most promising prior to extensive chemical synthesis.

We built a new, real-time database search (RTS) platform, Orbiter, to combat the SPS-MS3 methods longer duty cycles. RTS with Orbiter enables the elimination of SPS-MS3 scans if no peptide matches to a given spectrum. With Orbiters online proteomic analytical pipeline, which includes RTS and false discovery rate analysis, it was possible to process a single spectrum database search in less than 10 milliseconds. The result is a fast, functional means to identify peptide spectral matches using Comet, filter these matches, and more efficiently quantify proteins of interest. Importantly, the use of Comet for peptide spectral matching allowed for a fully featured search, including analysis of post-translational modifications, with well-known and extensively validated scoring. These data could then be used to trigger subsequent scans in an adaptive and flexible manner. In this work we tested the utility of this adaptive data acquisition platform to improve the efficiency and accuracy of multiplexed quantitative experiments. We found that RTS enabled a 2-fold increase in mass spectrometric data acquisition efficiency.

We performed CTCF ChIP-seq in multiple mouse species to create genome-wide binding profiles and associated them with TAD boundaries. Our analyses reveal that CTCF binding is maintained at TAD boundaries by an equilibrium of selective constraints and dynamic evolutionary processes. Regardless of their conservation across species, CTCF binding sites at TAD boundaries are subject to stronger sequence and functional constraints compared to other CTCF sites. TAD boundaries frequently harbor rapidly evolving clusters containing both evolutionary old and young CTCF sites as a result of repeated acquisition of new species-specific sites close to conserved ones. The overwhelming majority of clustered CTCF sites colocalize with cohesin and are significantly closer to gene transcription start sites than nonclustered CTCF sites, suggesting that CTCF clusters particularly contribute to cohesin stabilization and transcriptional regulation.

We found that stress leads to a genome-wide reduction in heritable small RNA levels and that mutants defective in different stress pathways exhibit irregular RNAi inheritance dynamics. Moreover, we discovered that resetting of heritable RNAi is orchestrated by MAPK pathway factors, the transcription factor SKN-1, and the MET-2 methyltransferase.

Particularly the role of lipoproteins in the pathobiological process and treatment of cardiovascular disease will be a main focus.\n\nParticipants1.005 individuals aged 21 years and older undergoing cardiac catheterization during 17 months at a tertiary academic cardiology center were enrolled. The baseline data set contains detailed phenotyping, broad biochemical parameters, genetic data, but also standardized personal and family history, a screening test for cognitive impairment, pulse wave analysis and measurements of hand grip strength, amongst others. Blood samples were stored in a biobank for future analyses.\n\nFindings to dateThe mean age of the participants at enrolment was 70.9{+/-}11.1 years (70% male). Coronary angiography provided evidence of obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in 69.9% of participants. Those with evidence of CAD were significantly more likely to be male, inactive, diabetic and with a family history of cardiovascular disease than participants without CAD.\n\n20% of patients had lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] concentrations above 106.9 nmol/L (fifth quintile). These patients had significantly increased odds of obstructive CAD compared to participants in quintiles 1-4 (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.17 to 2.48, p=0.005). There was reasonable evidence that with increasing severity of CAD the odds of having elevated Lp(a) increased. We were able to replicate the established strong association between specified single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the LPA gene (rs10455872, rs3798220 and rs186696265) and the APOE gene (rs7412), and the concentration of Lp(a), validating our phenotype database and biobank.\n\nFuture plansMortality information will be obtained in two-year intervals. Follow-up phone interviews will be conducted at 3, and 6 years after enrolment. We seek to cooperate with other researchers in the field, e.g. by sharing data and biobank samples.\n\nRegistrationnot applicable, purely observational study",1,626,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/669150v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/669150v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_669150.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, new bone formation in the rat calvarial defect implanted with the closed HA microspheres was limited. The objective of this work is to evaluate size-, time, and structure-dependent bone regeneration between open and closed HA microspheres in an osseous model. Open HA microspheres were obtained by sectioning closed HA microspheres. The open HA microsphere had dense convex surface and rough and porous concave surface. For both size ranges ({phi}106-150 m vs. {phi}212-250 m), the open HA microsphere were more effective in facilitating bone regeneration than the closed HA microspheres in rat calvarial defects. Bone regeneration in the open HA microspheres (49 {+/-} 7% for {phi}106-150 m; 40 {+/-} 8% for {phi}212-250 m) were higher than the closed HA microsphere (26 {+/-} 8% for {phi}106-150 m; 30 {+/-} 9% for {phi}212-250 m) at 12 weeks. Furthermore, the open HA microspheres of smaller size showed a significant increase in bone regeneration than the open HA microspheres of larger size at both 6 weeks and 12 weeks. The difference in bone regeneration between these microspheres could be due to their differences in microstructures, namely curvature, concavity, porosity, surface roughness, and total surface area available for cells to attached to.",0,433,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/669598v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/669598v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_669598.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Genetic variation has been shown to contribute to such clinical variation. We have previously found that protein aggregation-related phenotypes in a model organism, C. elegans, can be modified by destabilizing polymorphisms in the genetic background and by natural genetic variation. Here, we identified a large modifier locus in a Californian wild strain of C. elegans, DR1350, that alters the susceptibility of the head muscle cells to polyglutamine (polyQ) aggregation, and causes an increase in overall aggregation, without changing the basal activity of the muscle proteostasis pathways known to affect polyQ aggregation. We found that the two phenotypes were genetically separable, and identified regulatory variants in a gene encoding a conserved autophagy protein ATG-5 (ATG5 in humans) as being responsible for the overall increase in aggregation. The atg-5 gene conferred a dosage-dependent enhancement of polyQ aggregation, with DR1350-derived atg-5 allele behaving as a hypermorph. Examination of autophagy in animals bearing the modifier locus indicated enhanced response to an autophagy-activating treatment. Because autophagy is known to be required for the clearance of polyQ aggregates, this result was surprising. Thus, we tested whether directly activating autophagy, either pharmacologically or genetically, affected the polyQ aggregation in our model. Strikingly, we found that the effect of autophagy on polyQ aggregation was tissue-dependent, such that activation of autophagy decreased polyQ aggregation in the intestine, but increased it in the muscle cells. Our data show that cryptic genetic variants in genes encoding proteostasis components, although not causing visible phenotypes under normal conditions, can have profound effects on the behavior of aggregation-prone proteins, and suggest that activation of autophagy may have divergent effects on the clearance of such proteins in different cell types.",0,440,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/670042v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/670042v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_670042.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

W e developed an original protocol allowing the fast isolation of mycobacteria by combining a 1%-chlorhexidine decontamination of fecal matter with culture on MOD9 medium. Colonies were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry, combined with DNA sequencing. This protocol yielded no tuberculous mycobacteria among ninety-nine wild boar fecal samples collected in the Provence region. However, non-tuberculous mycobacteria were isolated from five samples (5.05%), including Mycobacterium peregrinum, Mycobacterium vaccae and Mycobacterium setense, the last species being previously unreported in the wild boar; in addition to two positive samples for Nocardia spp. In conclusion, wild boars in southeastern France are not shedding tuberculosis agents, but they could constitute a reservoir of human non-tuberculous mycobacteriosis in selected populations directly exposed to wild boars.",0,548,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/670166v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/670166v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_670166.txt,1,data availability statement,0,availability of data and materials 14   biorxiv preprint doi,NA

Diagnostic delay contributes to the poor outcome. There is an urgent need for new tools for the rapid diagnosis of TBM, especially in children.\n\nMethodsWe collected serum samples from children in whom TBM was suspected at a tertiary hospital in Cape Town, South Africa. Children were subsequently classified as having TBM or no TBM using a published uniform research case-definition. Using a multiplex cytokine array platform, we investigated the concentrations of serum biomarkers comprising 7-markers that were previously found to be of value in the diagnosis of adult pulmonary TB (CRP, SAA, CFH, IFN-{gamma}, IP-10, Apo-AI and transthyretin) plus other potentially useful host biomarkers as diagnostic candidates for TBM.\n\nFindingsOf 47 children included in the study, 23 (48.9%) had a final diagnosis of TBM of which six had HIV co-infection. A modified version of the adult 7-marker biosignature in which transthyretin was replaced by NCAM1, diagnosed TBM in children with AUC of 0.80 (95% CI, 0.67-0.92), sensitivity of 73.9% (95% CI, 51.6-89.8%) and specificity of 66.7% (95% CI, 44.7-84.4%). A new childhood TBM specific 3-marker biosignature (adipsin, A{beta}42 and IL-10) showed potential in the diagnosis of TBM, with AUC of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.73-0.96), sensitivity of 82.6% (95 CI, 61.2-95.0%) and specificity of 75.0% (95% CI, 53.3-90.2%) after leave-one-out cross validation.\n\nConclusionAn adult 7-marker serum protein biosignature showed potential in the diagnosis of TBM in children. However, a smaller childhood TBM-specific biosignature demonstrated improved performance characteristics. Our data indicates that blood-based biomarkers may be useful in the diagnosis of childhood TBM and require further investigation.",1,546,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/670323v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/670323v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_670323.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

This is evident in the Notch pathway, which regulates an array of cellular processes, despite a small number of core components. Here, we describe a Notch4 activated signaling cascade, dependent on the nucleolar localization of the Notch4 Intracellular Domain (NIC4), that protects cells from genotoxic damage. Localization was assessed by immune-staining for endogenous Notch4 and visualization by confocal microscopy, in breast cancer cell lines. Live-cell, imaging-based, biophysical analysis of NIC4-GFP expressing cells, indicated unhindered mobility between the nucleolus and nucleoplasm and a stable nucleolar pool of NIC4-GFP. RNAi-mediated ablations, coupled with analysis of recombinant forms of NIC4 with modifications of its nucleolar localization sequence, confirmed nucleolar localization and identified the nucleolar proteins, Nucleolin and Fibrillarin, as key intermediates in the NIC4-activated signaling cascade. The transcriptional control of ribosome biogenesis (47s and 45s pre-rRNA transcription), emerged as another unexpected consequence of the subcellular distribution of NIC4.

Transcriptomic profiling of E2F1 knockout tumors identified a role for E2F1 as a master regulator of a suite of pro-metastatic genes, but also uncovered E2F1 target genes with an unknown role in pulmonary metastasis. High expression of one of these genes, Fgf13, is associated with early human breast cancer metastasis in a clinical dataset. Together these data led to the hypothesis that Fgf13 is critical for breast cancer metastasis, and that upregulation of Fgf13 may partially explain how E2F1 promotes breast cancer metastasis. To test this hypothesis we ablated Fgf13 via CRISPR. Deletion of Fgf13 in a MMTV-PyMT breast cancer cell line reduces the frequency of pulmonary metastasis. In addition, loss of Fgf13 reduced in vitro cell migration, suggesting that Fgf13 may be critical for tumor cells to invade out of and escape the primary tumor.

Such inferences greatly benefit from new statistical approaches including approximate Bayesian computation - Random Forest (ABC-RF), the latter providing reliable inference at a low computational cost, with the possibility to take into account prior knowledge on both biogeographical history and genetic markers.

Gene circuits, coupled differential equations that represent gene product synthesis with a switch-like function, provide a biologically realistic framework for modeling the time evolution of gene expression. However, their use has been limited to smaller networks due to the computational expense of inferring model parameters from gene expression data using global non-linear optimization. Here we show that the switch-like nature of gene regulation can be exploited to break the gene circuit inference problem into two simpler optimization problems that are amenable to computationally efficient supervised learning techniques. We present FIGR (Fast Inference of Gene Regulation), a novel classification-based inference approach to determining gene circuit parameters. We demonstrate FIGRs effectiveness on synthetic data as well as experimental data from the gap gene system of Drosophila. FIGR is faster than global non-linear optimization by nearly three orders of magnitude and its computational complexity scales much better with GRN size. On a practical level, FIGR can accurately infer the biologically realistic gap gene network in under a minute on desktop-class hardware instead of requiring hours of parallel computing.

But how does the visual system keep track of which stimuli are repeated, especially after long delays and many intervening stimuli? We hypothesized that the hippocampus supports long-lag adaptation, given that it learns from single experiences, maintains information over delays, and sends feedback to visual cortex. We tested this hypothesis with fMRI in an amnesic patient, LSJ, who has encephalitic damage to the medial temporal lobe resulting in complete bilateral hippocampal loss. We measured adaptation at varying time lags between repetitions in functionally localized visual areas that were intact in LSJ. We observed that these areas track information over a few minutes even when the hippocampus is unavailable. Indeed, LSJ and controls were identical when attention was directed away from the repeating stimuli: adaptation occurred for lags up to three minutes, but not six minutes. However, when attention was directed toward stimuli, controls now showed an adaptation effect at six minutes but LSJ did not.

However, the mechanism by which mtDNA-CN influences disease is not currently understood. One such mechanism may be through regulation of nuclear gene expression via the modification of nuclear DNA (nDNA) methylation.

MethodsTo investigate this hypothesis, we assessed the relationship between mtDNA-CN and nDNA methylation in 2,507 African American (AA) and European American (EA) participants from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study. To validate our findings we assayed an additional 2,528 participants from the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS) (N=533) and Framingham Heart Study (FHS) (N=1,995). We further assessed the effect of experimental modification of mtDNA-CN through knockout of TFAM, a regulator of mtDNA replication, via CRISPR-Cas9.

ResultsThirty-four independent CpGs were associated with mtDNA-CN at genome-wide significance (P<5x10-8). Meta-analysis across all cohorts identified six mtDNA-CN associated CpGs at genome-wide significance (P<5x10-8). Additionally, over half of these CpGs were associated with phenotypes known to be associated with mtDNA-CN, including coronary heart disease, cardiovascular disease, and mortality. Experimental modification of mtDNA-CN demonstrated that modulation of mtDNA-CN directly drives changes in nDNA methylation and gene expression of specific CpGs and nearby transcripts. Strikingly, the  neuroactive ligand receptor interaction KEGG pathway was found to be highly overrepresented in the ARIC cohort (P= 5.24x10-12), as well as the TFAM knockout methylation (P=4.41x10-4) and expression (P=4.30x10-4) studies.

Cx43 is strongly expressed in premigratory cranial neural crest cells and is maintained throughout the neural crest cell epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), but its function in these cells is not known. To this end, we have used a combination of in vivo and ex vivo live imaging with confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry, and functional assays to assess gap junction formation, and Cx43 function, in chick premigratory cranial neural crest cells. Our results demonstrate that gap junctions exist between chick premigratory and migratory cranial neural crest cells, with Cx43 depletion inhibiting the function of gap junctions. While a reduction in Cx43 levels just prior to neural crest cell EMT did not affect EMT and subsequent emigration of neural crest cells from the neural tube, the size of the premigratory neural crest cell domain was decreased in the absence of any changes in cell proliferation or death.

The role of strain-specific immunity in preventing GAS infections is poorly understood, representing a critical knowledge gap in vaccine development. A recent GAS murine challenge study showed evidence that sterilising strain-specific and enduring immunity required two skin infections by the same GAS strain within three weeks. This mechanism of developing enduring immunity may be a significant impediment to the accumulation of immunity in populations.\n\nWe used a mathematical model of GAS transmission to investigate the epidemiological consequences of enduring strain-specific immunity developing only after two infections with the same strain within a specified interval. Accounting for uncertainty when correlating murine timeframes to humans, we varied this maximum inter-infection interval from 3 to 420 weeks to assess its impact on prevalence and strain diversity. Model outputs were compared with longitudinal GAS surveillance observations from northern Australia, a region with endemic infection. We also assessed the likely impact of a targeted strain-specific multivalent vaccine in this context.\n\nOur model produced patterns of transmission consistent with observations when the maximum inter-infection interval for developing enduring immunity was 19 weeks. Our vaccine analysis suggests that the leading multivalent GAS vaccine may have limited impact on the prevalence of GAS in populations in northern Australia if strain-specific immunity requires repeated episodes of infection.\n\nOur results suggest that observed GAS epidemiology from disease endemic settings is consistent with enduring strain-specific immunity being dependent on repeated infections with the same strain, and provide additional motivation for relevant human studies to confirm the human immune response to GAS skin infection.\n\nAuthor summaryGroup A Streptococcus (GAS) is a ubiquitous bacterial pathogen that exists in many distinct strains, and is a major cause of death and disability globally. Vaccines against GAS are under development, but their effective use will require better understanding of how immunity develops following infection. Evidence from an animal model of skin infection suggests that the generation of enduring strain-specific immunity requires two infections by the same strain within a short time frame. It is not clear if this mechanism of immune development operates in humans, nor how it would contribute to the persistence of GAS in populations and affect vaccine impact. We used a mathematical model of GAS transmission, calibrated to data collected in an Indigenous Australian community, to assess whether this mechanism of immune development is consistent with epidemiological observations, and to explore its implications for the impact of a vaccine. We found that it is plausible that repeat infections are required for the development of immunity in humans, and illustrate the difficulties associated with achieving sustained reductions in disease prevalence with a vaccine.",1,762,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/674135v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/674135v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_674135.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Two microtubule-binding complexes, the Ndc80 and Ska complexes, are important for efficient end-on coupling and may function as a unit in this process, but precise conditions for their interaction are unknown. Here, we report that the Ska-Ndc80 interaction is phosphorylation-dependent and does not require microtubules, applied force, or several previously identified functional determinants including the Ndc80-loop and the Ndc80-tail. Under force, Ska stabilizes end-on microtubule attachments in parallel with the Ndc80-tail, which we reveal to be essential for end-tracking by Ndc80 multimers. Modulation of force-coupling efficiency demonstrates that the duration of stalled microtubule disassembly predicts whether a microtubule is stabilized and rescued by the kinetochore, likely reflecting a structural transition of the microtubule end.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=78 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/675363v1_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (38K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@9e6207org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@35f668org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@c43242org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@bfcc13_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",1,405,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/675363v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/675363v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_675363.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Since many common fermentation hosts, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, are naturally unable to convert many component plant cell wall polysaccharides, the identification of organisms with broad catabolism capabilities represents an opportunity to expand the range of substrates used in fermentation biorefinery approaches. The red basidiomycete yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides is a promising and robust host for lipid and terpene derived chemicals. Previous studies demonstrated assimilation of a range of substrates, from C5/C6-sugars to aromatic molecules similar to lignin monomers. In the current study, we analyzed R. toruloides potential to assimilate D-galacturonic acid, a major sugar in many pectin-rich agricultural waste streams, including sugar beet pulp and citrus peels. D-galacturonic acid is not a preferred substrate for many fungi, but its metabolism was found to be on par with D-glucose and D-xylose in R. toruloides. A genome-wide analysis by combined RNAseq/RB-TDNAseq revealed those genes with high relevance for fitness on D-galacturonic acid. While R. toruloides was found to utilize the same non-phosphorylative catabolic pathway known from ascomycetes, the maximal velocities of several enzymes exceeded those previously reported. In addition, an efficient downstream glycerol catabolism and a novel transcription factor were found to be important for D-galacturonic acid utilization. These results set the basis for use of R. toruloides as a potential host for pectin-rich waste conversions and demonstrate its suitability as a model for metabolic studies in basidiomycetes.\n\nImportanceThe switch from the traditional fossil-based industry to a green and sustainable bio-economy demands the complete utilization of renewable feedstocks. Many currently used bio-conversion hosts are unable to utilize major components of plant biomass, warranting the identification of microorganisms with broader catabolic capacity and characterization of their unique biochemical pathways. D-galacturonic acid is a plant component of bio-conversion interest and is the major backbone sugar of pectin, a plant cell wall polysaccharide abundant in soft and young plant tissues. The red basidiomycete and oleaginous yeast Rhodosporidium toruloides has been previously shown to utilize a range of sugars and aromatic molecules. Using state-of-the-art functional genomic methods, physiological and biochemical assays, we elucidated the molecular basis underlying the efficient metabolism of D-galacturonic acid.

In the present study, a seed-based resting-state functional MRI method was used to explore the potential abnormal connectivity of this opercular region between an acoustic trauma tinnitus group presenting slight to mild tinnitus and a control group.

Shigellosis seems to be more transmissible in males than in females.\n\nAuthor summaryShigellosis, also known as bacillary dysentery, is an infectious disease caused by the genus Shigella spp. Developing countries have high disease burden of shigellosis. However, its relative transmissibility in male and female individuals remains unclear. In this study, we employed a mathematical model to explore the dataset of reported shigellosis cases built by Hubei Province, China from 2005 to 2017. Two indicators, secondary attack rate (SAR) and relative ratio of SAR between males and females, were developed to assess the relative transmissibility in males and females. We found that shigellosis has medium transmissibility among male and female individuals. The disease seems to be more transmissible in males than in females.",1,372,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/677088v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/677088v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_677088.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Broadband gamma activity (55 - 200 Hz) recorded with subdural electrocorticography (ECoG) during cognitive tasks has been proposed as an attractive tool for mapping cortical areas with specific function but until now has not proven definitive clinical value. Fewer studies have addressed whether the alpha (8 - 12 Hz) and beta (15 - 25 Hz) band activity could also be used to improve eloquent cortex identification. We compared alpha, beta and broadband gamma activity, and their combination for the identification of eloquent cortical areas defined by ESM. Ten patients participated in a delayed-match-to-sample task, where syllable sounds were matched to visually presented letters and responses given by keyboard. We used a generalized linear model (GLM) approach to find the optimal weighting of low frequency bands and broadband gamma power to predict the ESM categories. Broadband gamma activity increased more in eloquent areas than in non-eloquent areas and this difference had a diagnostic ability (area under (AU) the receiving operating characteristic curve - AUROC) of [~]70%. Both alpha and beta power decreased more in eloquent areas. Alpha power had lower AUROC than broadband gamma while beta had similar AUROC. AUROC was enhanced by the combination of alpha and broadband gamma (3% improvement) and by the combination of beta and broadband gamma (7% improvement) over the use of broadband gamma alone. Further analysis showed that the relative performance of broadband gamma and low frequency bands depended on multiple factors including the time period of the cognitive task, the location of the electrodes and the patients attention to the stimulus. However, the combination of beta band and broadband gamma always gave the best performance. We show how ECoG power modulation from cognitive testing periods can be used to map the probability of eloquence by ESM and how this probability can be used as an aid for optimal ESM planning. We conclude that low frequency power during cognitive testing can contribute to the identification of eloquent areas in patients with focal refractory epilepsy improving its precision but does not replace the need of ESM.\n\nHighlightsO_LIGamma, alpha and beta band activity has significant diagnostic ability to identify ESM defined eloquent cortical areas.\nC_LIO_LIWe present a novel method to combine gamma and low frequency activity for enhanced identification.\nC_LIO_LIWe quantify how identification is dependent on analysis time window, cortical function, and patients attentional engagement.\nC_LIO_LIWith further development, this approach may offer an alternative to ESM mapping with reduced burden for patients.\nC_LI",0,425,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/677195v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/677195v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_677195.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Psychometric examination using self-report instruments, such as the SCL-90-R, can assist diagnosis. The SCL-90-R, however, is a lengthy instrument and might not be tolerated by all patients. We assessed several abbreviated forms of the SCL-90-R in patients undergoing video encephalographic monitoring (VEM).\n\nMethod687 patients completed the SCL-90-R and scores were computed for the full SCL-90-R and five abbreviated forms. Correlations and mean differences were computed between different forms. Classification accuracy was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and measurements models were examined using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA).\n\nResultsAll abbreviated forms were strongly correlated with the SCL-90-R for general psychopathology (r = .93 - .99), depression (r = .89 - .95), anxiety (r = .97 - .98), psychosis (r = .95 - .99), and obsessive-compulsive symptoms (r = .97). Classification performance was similar across forms for depression and anxiety, with high negative predictive values (.90 - .94) and lower positive predictive values (.34 - .38). Classification performance for psychotic and obsessive-compulsive disorders was poor. Differences were observed between the full SCL-90-R and its abbreviated forms across most domains (d = 0.00 - 0.65). The published measurement model was most strongly validated for the SCL-27, SCL-14, and the SCL-K-9.\n\nConclusionsThese five SCL-90-R abbreviated forms show high convergent validity with the full version. In patients undergoing investigation for seizure-related disorders, the BSI or BSI-18 are most appropriate where screening for both depression and anxiety is required. The SCL-K-9 is appropriate when only a single measure of global psychological distress is required. None of the instruments were able to detect psychotic or obsessive-compulsive symptoms with great accuracy.

Using the satellite DNA-rich legume plant Lathyrus sativus as a model, we demonstrated this approach by analyzing eleven major satellite repeats using a set of nanopore reads ranging from 30 to over 200 kb in length and representing 0.73x genome coverage. We found surprising differences between the analyzed repeats because only two of them were predominantly organized in long arrays typical for satellite DNA. The remaining nine satellites were found to be derived from short tandem arrays located within LTR-retrotransposons that occasionally expanded in length. While the corresponding LTR-retrotransposons were dispersed across the genome, this array expansion occurred mainly in the primary constrictions of the L. sativus chromosomes, which suggests that these genome regions are favorable for satellite DNA accumulation.\n\nConclusionsThe presented approach proved to be efficient in revealing differences in long-range organization of satellite repeats that can be used to investigate their origin and evolution in the genome.",1,896,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/677575v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/677575v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_677575.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The ECM is a complex biomaterial composed of proteins, glycoproteins, proteoglycans, and glycosaminoglycans, secreted by cells. The ECM contains fundamental biological cues that modulate cell behavior and serves as a structural scaffold for cell adhesion and growth. For clinical applications, where immune rejection is a constraint, ECM can be processed using decellularization methods intended to remove cells and donor antigens from tissue or organs, while preserving native biological cues essential for cell growth and differentiation. Recent studies show bioengineered organs composed by a combination of a diversity of materials and stem cells as a possibility of new therapeutic strategies to treat diseases that affect different tissues and organs, including the central nervous system (CNS). Nevertheless, the methodologies currently described for brain decellularization involve the use of several chemical reagents with many steps that ultimately limit the process of organ or tissue recellularization. Here, we describe for the first time a fast and straightforward method for complete decellularization of mice brain by the combination of rapid freezing and thawing following the use of only one detergent (Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)). Our data show that using the protocol we describe here the brain can be entirely decellularized, while still maintaining ECM components that are essential for cell survival and repopulation of the scaffold. Our results also show the repopulation of the decellularized brain matrix with Neuro2a cells, that were identified by immunohistochemistry in their undifferentiated form. We conclude that this novel and simple method for brain decellularization can be used as a biocompatible scaffold for cell repopulation.\n\nImpact StatementFor the first time we describe an easy, effective and low cost method for complete decellularization of murine brain by the use of only one detergent (SDS) combined with rapid freezing and thawing, that can be used as a 3D scaffold for cell culture of neuronal cells. The results show that the decellularized brains still maintain ECM components essential for cell survival and repopulation of the scaffold.

On the one hand a stringent genetic quality control is necessary to maintain the genetic integrity of the entire species; on the other hand an overly stringent mechanism that kills oocytes with even minor DNA damage can deplete the whole primary oocyte pool leading to infertility. The p53 homolog TAp63 is the key regulator of genome integrity in oocytes. After DNA damage TAp63 is activated by multistep phosphorylation involving multiple phosphorylation events by the kinase CK1, which triggers the transition from a dimeric and inactive conformation to an open and active tetramer. By measuring activation kinetics in ovaries and single site phosphorylation kinetics in vitro with peptides and full length protein we show that TAp63 phosphorylation follows a biphasic behavior. While the first two CK1 phosphorylation events are fast, the third one that constitutes the decisive step to form the active conformation is slow.

This study includes 17 patients diagnosed as EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer and exposed to an EGFR-targeting TKI. The early response to treatment is evaluated with 3 computed tomography (CT) scans of the primitive tumor (one before the TKI introduction and two after). Using our knowledge of the disease, an imaging biomarker based on the tumor heterogeneity evolution between the first and the third exams is defined and computed using a novel mathematical model calibrated on patient data. Defining the overall survival as the time between the introduction of the TKI treatment and the patient death, we obtain a statistically significant correlation between the overall survival and our imaging marker (p = 0.009). Using the ROC curve, the patients are separated into two populations hence the comparison of the survival curves is statistically significant (p = 0.025). Initial state of the tumor seems to have a role for the prognosis of the response to TKI treatment. More precisely, the imaging marker - defined using only the CT scan before the TKI introduction - allows us to determine a first classification of the population which is refined over time using the imaging marker as more CT scans become available.

Here, we determined that Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase 4A3 (PTP4A3) plays a critical role in disease initiation and progression by promoting cell migration in T-ALL. PTP4A3 expression was upregulated in patient T-ALL samples at both the mRNA and protein levels compared to normal lymphocytes. Inhibition of PTP4A3 function with a small molecule inhibitor and knock-down of PTP4A3 expression using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA) in human T-ALL cells significantly impeded T-ALL cell migration capacity in vitro and reduced their ability to engraft and proliferate in vivo in xenograft mouse models. Additionally, PTP4A3 overexpression in a Myc-induced zebrafish T-ALL model significantly accelerated disease onset and shortened the time needed for cells to enter blood circulation. Reverse phase protein array (RPPA) revealed that manipulation of PTP4A3 expression levels in T-ALL cells directly affected the SRC signaling pathway, which plays a well-characterized role in migratory behavior of several cell types.

Confocal images of UCN34 passage across human colonic cells reveals that Sgg utilizes a paracellular pathway. Pil3 was previously shown to be expressed heterogeneously and WT UCN34 consists of about 90% of Pil3low and 10% of Pil3high cells. We found that both the {Delta}pil3 mutant and the Pil3+ overexpressing variant could not translocate across Caco-2 and T84 barriers.

Sgg is a commensal of the rumen of herbivores and transmission to humans most probably occurs through the oral route. In this work, we have studied how this bacterium crosses the intestinal barrier using well-known in vitro models. Confocal microscopy images revealed that Sgg UCN34 can traverse the epithelial monolayer in between adjacent cells. We next showed that passage of Sgg from the apical to the basolateral compartment is dependent on the heterogenous expression of the Pil3 pilus at the bacterial surface. We hypothesize that Pil3high cocci adhere firmly to epithelial cells to activate transient opening of tight junctions thereby allowing the traversal of Pil3low bacteria.",1,894,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/682278v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/682278v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_682278.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We found that >75% of federally-protected plants only occur in Canada peripherally, at the northernmost 20% or less of their total range, and that the most imperilled taxa had the smallest percentage of their range in Canada (endangered plants: median=1.0%). Occurring peripherally in Canada was associated with higher threat even after accounting for range area, potentially because range-edge taxa experienced 85% higher human population densities in their Canadian range than non-peripheral taxa. High conservation priority was not matched by habitat protection, as more imperilled and more peripheral taxa had smaller fractions of their Canadian range in protected areas. Finally, peer-reviewed research on plants at-risk in Canada was low. Only 42% of plants considered at-risk in Canada had been studied in Canada, and only 11% of species with large distributions outside Canada had been studied in the context of their wider geographic range--information that is critical to establishing their relative conservation value.

Leinwand,University of Colorado Boulder,2019-06-27,1,cc_by_nd,Cell Biology,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/06/27/682930.source.xml,"During cardiac disease progression, myocytes undergo molecular, functional and structural changes, including increases in cell size and shape, decreased myocyte alignment and contractility. The heart often increases extracellular matrix production and stiffness, which affect myocytes. The order and hierarchy of these events remain unclear as available in vitro cell culture systems do not adequately model both physiologic and pathologic environments. Traditional cell culture substrates are 5-6 orders of magnitude stiffer than even diseased native cardiac tissue. Studies that do account for substrate stiffness often do not consider intercellular alignment and vice versa. We developed a cardiac myocyte culture platform that better recapitulates native tissue stiffness while simultaneously introducing topographical cues that promote cellular alignment. We show that stiffness and topography impact myocyte molecular and functional properties. We used a spatiotemporally-tunable, photolabile hydrogel platform to generate a range of stiffness and micron-scale topographical patterns to guide neonatal rat ventricular myocyte morphology. Importantly, these substrate patterns were of subcellular dimensions to test whether cells would spontaneously respond to topographical cues rather than an imposed geometry. Cellular contractility was highest and the gene expression profile was most physiologic on gels with healthy cardiac tissue stiffness. Surprisingly, while elongated patterns in stiff gels yielded the greatest cellular alignment, the cells actually had more pathologic functional and molecular profiles. These results highlight that morphological measurements alone are not a surrogate for overall cellular health as many studies assume. In general, substrate stiffness and micropatterning synergistically affect cardiac myocyte phenotype to recreate physiologic and pathologic microenvironments.\n\nSignificance StatementHeart disease is accompanied by organ- and cellular-level remodeling, and deconvoluting their interplay is complex. Cellular-level change is best studied in vitro due to greater control and uniformity of cell types compared to animals. One common metric is degree of cellular alignment as misalignment of myocytes is a hallmark of disease. However, most studies utilize featureless culture surfaces that are orders of magnitude stiffer than, and do not mimic the scaffolding of, the heart. We developed a hydrogel platform with tunable stiffness and patterns providing topographical alignment cues. We cultured heart cells on and characterized multifactorial responses to these dynamic surfaces. Interestingly, conditions that yielded greatest alignment did not yield the healthiest functional and molecular state. Thus, morphology alone is not an indicator of overall cellular health.",0,321,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/682930v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/682930v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_682930.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

This paper presents a control approach broadly applicable to general multistate models based on encoding them as polynomial dynamical systems over a finite algebraic state set, and using computational algebra for finding appropriate intervention strategies. To demonstrate the feasibility and applicability of this method, we apply it to a recently developed multistate intracellular model of E2F-mediated bladder cancerous growth, and to a model linking intracellular iron metabolism and oncogenic pathways. The control strategies identified for these published models are novel in some cases and represent new hypotheses, or are supported by the literature in others as potential drug targets.\n\nOur Macaulay2 scripts to find control strategies are publicly available through GitHub at https://github.com/luissv7/multistatepdscontrol.",1,131,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/682989v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/682989v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_682989.txt,0,NA,1,NA,our macaulay2 scripts to find control strategies are publicly available through github at https://github.com/luissv7/multistatepdscontrol.;     we used a docker image of macaulay2 v: 1.14 [15] and a script available in the github repository for the conversion. 6 supplementary materials all scripts used to generate the data in this manuscript can be found in the first author’s github repository https://github.com/luissv7/multistatepdscontrol.

With these methods, we can detect the heterogeneity of epigenomic profiles within complex biological samples. Yet, existing tools used to analyze bulk epigenomic experiments are not fit for the low coverage and sparsity of single-cell epigenomic datasets.

The user can identify different sub-populations within heterogeneous samples, find differentially enriched regions between subpopulations and identify associated genes and pathways. ChromSCape accepts multiple samples to allow comparisons of cell populations between and within samples.

Although rare, the onset of IS during infancy is the more severe and rapidly progressive form of the disease, leading to increased mortality due to significant respiratory compromise. The pathophysiology of IS, in particular for infantile IS, remain elusive. Here, we show that PRMT5 is critical for the regulation of terminal hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation in the spine and models infantile IS in mouse. Conditional ablation of PRMT5 in osteochondral progenitors led to impaired terminal hypertrophic chondrocyte differentiation and asymmetric defects of endochondral bone formation in the perinatal spine. Analysis of several markers of endochondral ossification revealed increased COLX and Ihh expression and a dramatic reduction of Mmp13 and RUNX2 expression in the intervertebral disc and vertebral growth plate. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PRMT5 function in committed chondrogenic lineages is required for regulation of COLX expression in the adult spine.

The leading edge of the polarized morphology was a spherical protrusion devoid of F-actin but with occasional F-actin scars, indicating the presence of bleb. The polarized form was stable bleb driven since the blebbing was limited to the leading edge. Pentoxifylline induced chemokinesis in Entamoeba as it switched the motility pattern from slow and random to fast and directionally persistent. Pentoxifylline speeded up the cell aggregation in E. invadens during growth and encystation due to enhanced chemotaxis of the polarized form. The transformation of non-polarized adherent trophozoites to nonadherent stable bleb driven form occurred via lamellipodial and bleb driven adherent intermediate phenotypes. The nonadherent polarized phenotype was highly motile under confinement and moved by rearward plasma membrane flow. In contrast to pentoxifylline, adenosine, the adenosine receptor agonist, stimulated the formation of multiple protrusions leading to random motility. Thus pentoxifylline might prevent lateral protrusions by inhibiting adenosine receptor, producing the monopodial polarized morphology.\n\nSummary statementPentoxifylline, the adenosine receptor antagonist induced a stable bleb driven polarized morphology in Entamoeba characterized by fast, directionally persistent and highly chemotactic motility.",0,417,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/683813v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/683813v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_683813.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

One physiological measurement that has been previously investigated in this context, heart rate variability (HRV), has substantial health implications regarding the ability to adapt to stressors and has been shown to be altered in many cardiovascular and neurological disorders. Intriguingly, previous work found significant, strong correlations between HRV and geomagnetic/solar activity. In an attempt to replicate these findings, we simultaneously measured HRV from 20 healthy participants during a thirty-day period. In agreement with previous work, we found several significant correlations between HRV and geophysical time-series. However, after correction for autocorrelation, which is inherent in time-series, the only significant results were an increase in very low frequency during higher local geomagnetic activity and a geomagnetic anticipatory decrease in heart rate a day before higher global geomagnetic activity. Both correlations were very low. The loss of most significant effects after this correction suggests that previous findings may be a result of autocorrelation. A further note of caution is required since our and the previous studies in the field do not correct for multiple comparisons given the exploratory analysis strategy. We thus conclude that the effects of geomagnetic and solar activity are (if present) most likely of very small effect size and question the validity of the previous studies given the methodological concerns we have uncovered in our work.",1,286,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/684035v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/684035v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_684035.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We examined focal adhesion protein homologs in tissues of the freshwater sponge, Ephydatia muelleri (phylum Porifera). We found that sponge homologs of focal adhesion proteins co-precipitate as a complex and localize to cell junctions in sponge tissues. These data support that the adhesion roles of these proteins evolved early, prior to the divergence of sponges and other animals. However, in contrast to the spatially partitioned distribution of cell junctions in epithelia of other animals, focal adhesion proteins were found to be co-distributed with the adherens junction protein Em{beta}-catenin in sponge tissues; both at certain cell-cell and cell-extracellular matrix (ECM) adhesions. Sponge adhesion structures were found to be unique in other ways, too.

Computerized cognitive training (CCT) is among the candidate interventions that may alleviate cognitive difficulties, but the evidence supporting its feasibility and effectiveness is scarce, partly due to the lack of tools for outcome prediction and monitoring. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides candidate markers for disease monitoring and outcome prediction. By integrating information not only about lesion extent and localization, but also regarding the integrity of the unaffected parts of the brain, advanced MRI provides relevant information for developing better prediction models in order to tailor cognitive intervention for patients, especially in a chronic phase.\n\nUsing brain age prediction based on MRI based brain morphometry and machine learning, we tested the hypotheses that stroke patients with a younger-appearing brain relative to their chronological age perform better on cognitive tests and benefit more from cognitive training compared to patients with an older-appearing brain. In this randomized double-blind study, 54 patients who suffered mild stroke (>6 months since hospital admission, NIHSS<7 at hospital discharge) underwent 3-weeks CCT and MRI before and after the intervention. In addition, patients were randomized to one of two groups receiving either active or sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). We tested for main effects of brain age gap (estimated age - chronological age) on cognitive performance, and associations between brain age gap and task improvement.

Although it is well known that attention can modulate neural responses in many brain areas, the computational principles underlying attentional modulation remain unclear. Contrary to the prevailing view of a high-dimensional, distributed neural representation, here we show a surprisingly simple, biased neural representation for feature-based attention in a large dataset including five human fMRI studies. We found that when participants selected one feature from a compound stimulus, voxels in many cortical areas responded consistently higher to one attended feature over the other. This univariate bias was robust at the level of single brain areas and consistent across brain areas within individual subjects. Importantly, this univariate bias showed a progressively stronger magnitude along the cortical hierarchy. In frontoparietal areas, the bias was strongest and contributed largely to pattern-based decoding, whereas early visual areas lacked such a bias.

Here we test whether Inc serves as a Cul3 adaptor by generating mutant forms of Inc and assessing their biochemical properties and physiological activity in vivo. We show that the N-terminal BTB domain of Inc is necessary and sufficient for Inc self-association and interactions with Cul3. Inc point mutations that weaken interactions with Cul3 impair the ability of Inc to rescue the sleep deficits of inc mutants, indicating that Cul3-Inc binding is critical for Inc function in vivo. Deletions of the conserved Inc C-terminus preserve Inc-Inc and Inc-Cul3 interactions but abolish Inc activity in vivo, implicating the Inc C-terminus as an effector domain that recruits Inc substrates. Mutation of a conserved C-terminal arginine similarly abolishes Inc function, suggesting that this residue is vital for the recruitment or ubiquitination of Inc targets. Mutation of the same residue in the human Inc ortholog KCTD17 is associated with myoclonic dystonia, indicating its functional importance in Inc family members. Finally, we show that Inc assembles into multimeric Cul3-Inc complexes in vivo and that depleting Cul3 causes accumulation of Inc, suggesting that Inc is negatively regulated by Cul3-dependent autocatalytic ubiquitination, a hallmark of Cullin adaptors.

Conduction through gap junctions strongly depends on the hemichannel arrangement and transjunctional voltage, rendering the intercellular conductance highly non-Ohmic. Despite this marked non-linear behavior, current tissue-level models of cardiac conduction are rooted on the assumption that gap-junctions conductance is constant (Ohmic), which results in inaccurate predictions of electrical propagation, particularly in the low junctional-coupling regime observed under pathological conditions. In this work, we present a novel non-Ohmic multiscale (NOM) model of cardiac conduction that is suitable for tissue-level simulations. Using non-linear homogenization theory, we develop a conductivity model that seamlessly upscales the voltage-dependent conductance of gap junctions, without the need of explicitly modeling gap junctions. The NOM model allows for the simulation of electrical propagation in tissue-level cardiac domains that accurately resemble that of cell-based microscopic models for a wide range of junctional coupling scenarios, recovering key conduction features at a fraction of the computational complexity. A unique feature of the NOM model is the possibility of upscaling the response of non-symmetric gap-junction conductance distributions, which result in conduction velocities that strongly depend on the direction of propagation, thus allowing to model the normal and retrograde conduction observed in certain regions of the heart. We envision that the NOM model will enable organ-level simulations that are informed by sub- and inter-cellular mechanisms, delivering an accurate and predictive in-silico tool for understanding the heart function.\n\nAuthor summaryThe heart relies on the propagation of electrical impulses that are mediated gap junctions, whose conduction properties vary depending on the transjunctional voltage. Despite this non-linear feature, current mathematical models assume that cardiac tissue behaves like an Ohmic (linear) material, thus delivering inaccurate results when simulated in a computer. Here we present a novel mathematical multiscale model that explicitly includes the non-Ohmic response of gap junctions in its predictions. Our results show that the proposed model recovers important conduction features modulated by gap junctions at a fraction of the computational complexity. This contribution represents an important step towards constructing computer models of a whole heart that can predict organ-level behavior in reasonable computing times.",1,737,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/690255v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/690255v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_690255.txt,0,NA,1,NA,codes are  226  available for download at https://github.com/dehurtado/nonohmicconduction.  227  11/17   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/690255; this version posted july 2 2019.

In Switzerland a nationwide footrot control program for sheep focusing on the virulent strain shall soon be implemented. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to estimate the nationwide prevalence of both strains of D. nodosus in four wild indigenous ruminant species and to identify potential susceptible maintenance hosts that could be a reinfection source for sheep. During two years (2017-2018), interdigital swabs of 1,821 wild indigenous ruminants species (Alpine ibex; Alpine chamois, Rupicapra rupicapra; roe deer, Capreolus capreolus; red deer, Cervus elaphus) were analysed by Real-Time PCR. Furthermore, observed interspecies interactions were documented for each sample. Overall, we report a low prevalence of D. nodosus in all four indigenous wild ruminants, for both the benign (1.97%, N = 36, of which 31 red deer) and virulent (0.05%, N = 1) strain of D. nodosus. Footrot lesions were documented in one ibex with the virulent strain, and in one ibex with the benign strain. Interactions with domestic livestock occurred mainly with cattle and sheep. In conclusion, the data suggest that domestic ungulates represent a significant source of infection for wild ungulates, while wild ruminants are likely irrelevant for the maintenance and spread of D. nodosus.

Examining the meiosis in cin8{triangleup} kip3{triangleup} cells, we detected chromosome breakage in the meiosis II cells. The double mutant exhibits delay in the cohesin removal and spindle elongation during anaphase I. Consequently, some cells abrogate meiosis II and form dyads while some, as they progress through meiosis II, cause defect in chromosome integrity. We believe that in the latter cells, an imbalance of spindle mediated force and simultaneous persistent cohesin on the chromosomes cause their breakage. We provide evidence that tension generated by Cin8 and Kip3 through microtubule cross-linking is essential for signaling efficient cohesin removal and maintenance of chromosome integrity during meiosis.\n\nSummaryMolecular motors generate forces that facilitate chromosome segregation.

However, a subsequent experiment in conscious animals showed that few RVLM neurons respond to small-amplitude movements. This study tested the hypothesis that vestibular inputs to RVLM neurons are modulated in conscious animals, such that vestibulosympathetic responses are only elicited when changes in body position are large enough to require changes in sympathetic nerve activity. The activity of approximately a third of RVLM neurons whose firing rate was related to the cardiac cycle, and thus likely received baroreceptor inputs, responded to vestibular inputs elicited by 40{degrees} head-up tilts in conscious cats, but not during 10{degrees} sinusoidal rotations in the pitch plane that affected the activity of neurons in brain regions providing inputs to the RVLM. These data suggest the existence of brain circuitry that suppresses vestibular influences on the activity of RVLM neurons and the sympathetic nervous system unless these inputs are physiologically warranted. We also determined that RVLM activity is not altered prior to tilts when a light cue is provided signaling the movement. The simplest interpretation of this findings is that feedforward cardiovascular responses are associated with active movement such as occurs during exercise, but not passive movements that require cardiovascular adjustments.",1,698,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/693408v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/693408v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_693408.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

A3R antagonists have been described as potential treatments for numerous diseases including asthma. Given the similarity between ARs orthosteric binding sites, obtaining highly selective antagonists is a challenging but critical task.

Experimental approach39 potential A3R, antagonists were screened using agonist-induced inhibition of cAMP. Positive hits were assessed for AR subtype selectivity through cAMP accumulation assays. The antagonist affinity was determined using Schild analysis (pA2 values) and fluorescent ligand binding. Further, a likely binding pose of the most potent antagonist (K18) was determined through molecular dynamic (MD) simulations and consistent calculated binding free energy differences between K18 and congeners, using a homology model of A3R, combined with mutagenesis studies.

Key ResultsWe demonstrate that K18, which contains a 3-(dichlorophenyl)-isoxazole group connected through carbonyloxycarboximidamide fragment with a 1,3-thiazole ring, is a specific A3R (<1 {micro}M) competitive antagonist. Structure-activity relationship investigations revealed that loss of the 3-(dichlorophenyl)-isoxazole group significantly attenuated K18 antagonistic potency. Mutagenic studies supported by MD simulations identified the residues important for binding in the A3R orthosteric site. Finally, we introduce a model that enables estimates of the equilibrium binding affinity for rapidly disassociating compounds from real-time fluorescent ligand-binding studies.

Conclusions and ImplicationsThese results demonstrate the pharmacological characterisation of a selective competitive A3R antagonist and the description of its orthosteric binding mode. Our findings may provide new insight for drug discovery.

We formulate responses to stressful scenarios in terms of Bayesian belief-updating and subsequent policy selection; namely, planning as (active) inference. Using a minimal model of how creatures or subjects account for their sensations (and subsequent action), we deconstruct the sequences of belief updating and behaviour that underwrite stress-related responses - and simulate the aberrant responses of the sort seen in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Crucially, the model used for belief-updating generates predictions in multiple (exteroceptive, proprioceptive and interoceptive) modalities, to provide an integrated account of evidence accumulation and multimodal integration that has consequences for both motor and autonomic responses. The ensuing phenomenology speaks to many constructs in the ecological and clinical literature on stress, which we unpack with reference to simulated inference processes and accompanying neuronal responses. A key insight afforded by this formal approach rests on the trade-off between the epistemic affordance of certain cues (that resolve uncertainty about states of affairs in the environment) and the consequences of epistemic foraging (that may be in conflict with the instrumental or pragmatic value of  fleeing or  freezing). Starting from first principles, we show how this trade-off is nuanced by prior (subpersonal) beliefs about the outcomes of behaviour - beliefs that, when held with unduly high precision, can lead to (Bayes optimal) responses that closely resemble PTSD.",1,778,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/695445v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/695445v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_695445.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

There is extensive heterogeneity among insulin-secreting {beta}-cells within islets of Langerhans, including their insulin secretory response and gene expression profile; and this heterogeneity can be altered in diabetes. Several studies have identified variations in nutrient sensing between {beta}-cells, including glucokinase (GK) levels, mitochondrial function or expression of genes important for glucose metabolism. Sub-populations of {beta}-cells with defined electrical properties can disproportionately influence islet-wide free-calcium activity ([Ca2+]) and insulin secretion, via gap junction electrical coupling. However, it is poorly understood how sub-populations of {beta}-cells with altered glucose metabolism may impact islet function. To address this, we utilized a multicellular computational model of the islet in which a population of cells deficient in GK activity and glucose metabolism was imposed on the islet, or where {beta}-cells were heterogeneous in glucose metabolism and GK kinetics were altered. This included simulating Glucokinase gene (GCK) mutations that cause monogenic diabetes. We combined these approaches with experimental models in which gck was genetically deleted in a population of cells or GK was pharmacologically inhibited. In each case we modulated gap junction electrical coupling. Both the simulated islet and the experimental system required 30-50% of the cells to have near-normal glucose metabolism. Below this number, the islet lacked any glucose-stimulated [Ca2+] elevations. In the absence of electrical coupling the change in [Ca2+] was more gradual. As such, given heterogeneity in glucose metabolism, electrical coupling allows a large minority of cells with normal glucose metabolism to promote glucose-stimulated [Ca2+]. If insufficient numbers of cells are present, which we predict can be caused by a subset of GCK mutations that cause monogenic diabetes, electrical coupling exacerbates [Ca2+] suppression. This demonstrates precisely how heterogeneous {beta}-cell populations interact to impact islet function.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEBiological tissues contain heterogeneous populations of cells. Insulin-secreting {beta}-cells within the islets of Langerhans are critical for regulating blood glucose homeostasis. {beta}-cells are heterogeneous but it is unclear how the islet response is impacted by different cell populations and their interactions. We use a multicellular computational model and experimental systems to predict and quantify how cellular populations defined by varied glucose metabolism interact via electrical communication to impact islet function. When glucose metabolism is heterogeneous, electrical coupling is critical to promote electrical activity. However, when cells deficient in glucose metabolism are in the majority, electrical activity is completely suppressed. Thus modulating electrical communication can promotes islet electrical activity, following dysfunction caused by gene mutations that impact glucose metabolism.",1,853,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/696096v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/696096v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_696096.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Consequently, several mechanisms and strategies have evolved to optimize the signal-to-noise ratio. Examples to increase detectability are the Lombard effect, an involuntary rise in call amplitude in response to masking ambient noise, which is often associated with several other vocal changes such as call frequency and duration, as well as the animals capability of limiting calling to periods where noise perturbation is absent. Previous studies revealed rapid vocal flexibility and various audio-vocal integration mechanisms in marmoset monkeys. Using acoustic perturbation triggered by vocal behavior, we investigated whether marmoset monkeys are capable of exhibiting changes in call structure when perturbing noise starts after call onset or whether such effects only occur if noise perturbation starts prior to call onset. We show that marmoset monkeys are capable of rapidly modulating call amplitude and frequency in response to such perturbing noise bursts. Vocalizations swiftly increased call frequency after noise onset indicating a rapid effect of perturbing noise on vocal motor pattern production. Call amplitudes were also affected. Interestingly, however, the marmosets did not exhibit the Lombard effect as previously reported but decreased their call intensity in response to perturbing noise. Our findings indicate that marmosets possess a general avoidance strategy to call in the presences of ambient noise and suggest that these animals are capable of counteracting a previously thought involuntary audio-vocal mechanism, the Lombard effect, presumably via cognitive control processes.",1,888,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/696989v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/696989v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_696989.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

At large spatial scales such as those studied in human M/EEG, measured oscillatory dynamics are believed to arise primarily from a combination of cortical (intracolumnar) and corticothalamic rhythmogenic mechanisms. Whilst considerable progress has been made in characterizing these two types of neural circuit separately, relatively little work has been done that attempts to unify them into a single consistent picture. This is the aim of the present paper. We present and examine a whole-brain, connectome-based neural mass model with detailed long-range cortico-cortical connectivity and strong, recurrent corticothalamic circuitry. This system reproduces a variety of known features of human M/EEG recordings, including a 1/f spectral profile, spectral peaks at canonical frequencies, and functional connectivity structure that is shaped by the underlying anatomical connectivity. Importantly, our model is able to capture state-(e.g. idling/active) dependent fluctuations in oscillatory activity and the coexistence of multiple oscillatory phenomena, as well as frequency-specific modulation of functional connectivity. We find that increasing the level of sensory or neuromodulatory drive to the thalamus triggers a suppression of the dominant low frequency rhythms generated by corticothalamic loops, and subsequent disinhibition of higher frequency endogenous rhythmic behaviour of intra-columnar microcircuits. These combine to yield simultaneous decreases in lower frequency and increases in higher frequency components of the M/EEG power spectrum during states of high sensory or cognitive drive. Building on this, we also explored the effect of pulsatile brain stimulation on ongoing oscillatory activity, and evaluated the impact of coexistent frequencies and state-dependent fluctuations on the response of cortical networks. Our results provide new insight into the role played by cortical and corticothalamic circuits in shaping intrinsic brain rhythms, and suggest new directions for brain stimulation therapies aimed at state-and frequency-specific control of oscillatory brain activity.\n\nAuthor SummaryOne of the most distinctive features of brain activity is that it is highly rhythmic. Developing a better understanding of how these rhythms are generated, and how they can be controlled in clinical applications, is a central goal of modern neuroscience. Here we have developed a computational model that succinctly captures several key aspects of the rhythmic brain activity most easily measurable in human subjects. In particular, it provides both a conceptual and a concrete mathematical framework for understanding the well-established experimental observation of antagonism between high- and low-frequency oscillations in human brain recordings. This dynamic has important implications for how we understand the modulation of rhythmic activity in diverse cognitive states relating to arousal, attention, and cognitive processing. As we demonstrate, our model also provides a tool for investigating and improving the use of rhythmic brain stimulation in clinical applications.",1,867,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/697045v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/697045v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_697045.txt,1,general-purpose repository,1,all code and processed data used in this study is  509  freely available at https://github.com/griffithslab/ctwc-model along with additional notes  510  and comments.,all code and processed data used in this study is  509  freely available at https://github.com/griffithslab/ctwc-model along with additional notes  510  and comments.

However, its underlying cause remains elusive, with magnocellular visual processing, temporal auditory processing, visual attentional deficits and cerebellar dysfunction all gaining some traction. More recent theories have concerned visual attention span, measuring the parallel attentive capacity of the sensory visual system. However the VA span task as implemented requires reports, both conscious recall and recognition of letters, that activate many cortical areas beyond sensory visual cortex. Change detection, in contrast, does not require the conscious recognition of items, but simply awareness that the stimulus has changed, or not, again testing visual attention in a parallel fashion, but avoiding the complications of higher order cognitive processes. Thus, we investigated change detection in 33 good and poor readers with ages of around 10 yr, using a gap paradigm. Groups of 4 letters or 4 shapes were presented for a fixed time (0.7 s), followed after a 0.25 s gap, by a second similar group, each item surrounded by an annular frame filled with dynamic random noise of variable contrast. Detection performance was manipulated by varying the contrast of these meta-contrast mask frames, yielding a threshold contrast of the frames at which participants could just detect change. In two separate experiments, letters and rectangular shapes were used as target items, in order to test whether previous findings of superior change detection in good compared with poor readers was a result of greater automaticity in letter recognition of the good readers. The results indicate that the good readers were able to detect change at higher levels of masking distraction for both the letter and shape targets, indicating that this difference is not specifically related to to the training of graphemic or lexical information but more likely reflects a difference in alerting or pre-recognition stages of visual processing. Together, the results provide further support of the notion that there is a low level attentional performance difference between dyslexic and normal reading children.

In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the transition between these lifestyles is known to be modulated by the intracellular secondary messenger cyclic dimeric-GMP (c-di-GMP). We are interested in the control of distinct biofilm-relevant phenotypes in P. aeruginosa through the modulation of intracellular c-di-GMP. Here, we characterise motility and associated biofilm formation and dispersal in two pairs of related multi-domain proteins with putative c-di-GMP turnover domains, selected to contain additional PAS (Per-Arnt-Sim) homology domains known for their ability to process environmental stimuli. The enzymes PA0861 (RbdA) and PA2072 have distinct functions despite their similar domain structures. The {Delta}rbdA deletion mutant showed significantly increased biofilm formation while biofilm formation was impaired in {Delta}PA2072. Using a GFP transcriptional reporter fused to the cyclic di-GMP-responsive cdrA promoter, we show correlation between biofilm phenotype and c-di-GMP levels. Both proteins are shown to play a role in nitric oxide (NO) induced biofilm dispersal. We further studied pseudo-enzymes of similar architecture. PA5017 (DipA) is an inactive cyclase, and PA4959 (FimX) is described here as an inactive cyclase/phosphodiesterase. Loss of swimming and twitching motilities, respectively, is observed in deletion variants, which correlated with NO-induced biofilm dispersal phenotypes, as {Delta}dipA dispersed less well while {Delta}fimX dispersed better than wild type. The study highlights how Pseudomonas differentiates c-di-GMP output - in this case motility - using structurally very similar proteins and underlines a significant role for pseudo-enzymes in motility regulation and associated biofilm dispersal.\n\nImportanceBacterial biofilms exert pervasive economic and societal impact across a range of environmental, engineered and clinical contexts. The secondary messenger cyclic guanosine di-phosphate, c-di-GMP, is known to control the ability of many bacteria to form biofilms.

The specific protein sensory domains and mechanisms of motility that lead to biofilm dispersal remain to be fully understood.

Human deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) was conditionally expressed in the S. cerevisiae genomic library of knockout and knockdown (YKO/KD) strains, to globally and quantitatively characterize differential drug-gene interaction for gemcitabine and cytarabine.

These modifications allow the rapid copying of long RNA templates by multi-step ligation of tetranucleotides, as well as the assembly of long oligonucleotides from short template splints. Our work shows that a functional RNA ligase ribozyme can be assembled from relatively short oligonucleotides, demonstrating a transition from non-enzymatic ligation to enzymatic ligation.

We therefore compared the in vitro functional and molecular characteristics of fresh and cryopreserved hiPSC-CMs generated from two independent hiPSC lines. While the frozen hiPSC-CMs exhibited poorer replating than their freshly-derived counterparts, there was no difference in the proportion of cardiomyocytes retrieved from the mixed population when this was factored in.

However, characterization of the population genetics of Chinese buffalo is poorly understood. Using Axiom(R) buffalo genotyping array, we performed the genetic diversity, linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern and signature of selection in the 176 Chinese buffaloes from thirteen breeds. A total of 35,547 SNPs passed quality control and were used for further analyses. Population genetic analysis revealed a clear separation between the swamp and river types. Ten Chinese indigenous breeds clustered into the swamp group, Murrah and Nili-Ravi breeds were the river group, and the crossbred breed was closer to the river group. Genetic diversity analysis showed that the swamp group had a lower average expected heterozygosities compared to the river group. LD decay distance was much shorter in the swamp group compared with the river group with [Formula] value of approximately 50 Kb. Analysis of runs of homozygosity indicated that extensive remote and recent inbreeding activity was respectively found within swamp and river groups. Moreover, a total of 12 genomic regions under selection were detected between river and swamp groups. Further, 12 QTL regions were found associated with buffalo milk production traits. Some candidate genes within these QTLs were predicted to be involved in the cell structure and function, suggesting that these genes might play vital roles in the buffalo milk performance. Our data contribute to our understanding of the characterization of population genetics in Chinese buffaloes, which in turn may be utilized in buffalo breeding programs.\n\nAuthor SummaryIdentifying the causal genes or markers associated with important economic traits in livestock is critical to increasing the production level on the species. However, current understanding of the genetic basis for milk production traits in buffalo is limited. Here, we confirmed the divergent evolution, distinct population structure, and LD extent among Chinese buffalo breeds. We also identified 12 QTL regions associated with milk production traits in buffaloes using the selective sweeps and haplotype analysis. Further, a total of 7 genes involved in the cell structure and function were predicted within the identified QTLs. These findings suggested that these genes can serve as the candidate genes associated with buffalo milk production, which hold a vital role in the milk trait improvement of dairy buffalo industry.",1,688,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/701045v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/701045v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_701045.txt,1,supplement,0,431  s1 data sheets.,NA

As the role of vision is reduced or disappears, other sensory modalities become hypertrophied allowing cave-adapted organisms to successfully detect and interact their surrounding environment. The array of aquatic subterranean habitats, from fast-flowing streams and waterfalls, to quiet phreatic pools, presents a diverse palette to examine what possible sensory solutions have evolved against a backdrop of complete darkness. Mechanosensation is enhanced in many subterranean animals to such an extent that a longer appendage is recognized as a prominent troglomorphic adaptation in many metazoans. Fishes, however, not only interact with the environment using their fins, but also with specialized sensory organs to detect hydrodynamic events. We hypothesize that subterranean adaptation drives the hypertrophy of the mechanosensory lateral line, but that other environmental forces dictate the specific neuromast phenotype. To this end, we studied differences in the cephalic lateral line of the fishes in the North American family Amblyopsidae, which includes surface, cave-facultative, and cave-obligate species. None of the taxa we examined possessed canal neuromasts on the head. Primarily surface-dwelling species, Chologaster cornuta and Forbesichthys agassizii, possessed receded neuromasts throughout most of the head, with a few on papillae located in front of the nostrils and on ventral grooves on each side of the mouth. The cavefishes Amyblopsis spelaea and Typhlichthys subterraneous possessed papillate superficial neuromasts all over the head. We speculate that the change from the surface to the cave environment has led to papillate neuromasts in this group, which are likely shaped to detect the hydrodynamic characteristics of the boundary layer created by the swimming fish. Moving sensory organs from the surface of the body out into the boundary layer could increase sensitivity to high frequency stimuli created by prey, predators, and conspecifics.",1,713,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/701490v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/701490v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_701490.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

PLB and SLN are single-pass transmembrane (TM) peptides that are critically involved in regulation of contractility in cardiac and skeletal muscle via reversible inhibition of calcium (Ca) transport by SERCA. PLB and SLN also exhibit ion channel activity in vitro, yet the physiological significance of these functions is unknown. Here we have determined that structural insights offered by the tetrameric PLB Cys41 to Leu (C41L) mutation, a mutant with four possible leucine/isoleucine zipper interactions for stabilizing PLB tetramers. Using scanning alanine mutagenesis and SDS-PAGE, we have determined the C41L-PLB tetramer is destabilized by mutation of Leu37 to Ala (L37A) or Ile40 to Ala (I40A), which are the same a- and d-arm residues stabilizing the PLB pentamer via leucine/isoleucine zippers, highlighting the importance of these two zippers in PLB higher-order oligomerization. The new possible zipper arm in C41L-PLB (N34, C41L, I48) did not contribute to tetramerization. On the other hand, we determined that tetramer conversion back to pentamer was induced by alanine mutation of Ile48, a residue located on the e-arm below C41L, implicating steric interaction and restriction are the stabilizing and destabilizing forces that control the distribution between pentamer and tetramer populations. We propose that the e-arm and hydrophobic residues in the adjacent b-arm act as secondary structural motifs that help control the stoichiometry of PLB oligomerization. FRET microscopy and alanine mutagenesis of SLN residues Val14 (V14A) or Leu21 (L21A) decreased the binding affinity of the SLN-SLN complex, demonstrating the importance of each residue in mediating self-association. Helical wheel analysis supports a heptad-repeat TM zipper mechanism of SLN oligomerization, similar to the 3.5 residue/turn Leu and Ile zippers found in PLB pentamers. Collectively, our studies add new insights on the conservation of homologous hydrophobic 3-4 pattern of residues in zipper motifs that mediate PLB and SLN self-assembly.

Although neurons at each level exhibit contrast gain control to similar degrees, adaptation time constants become longer at later stages of the processing hierarchy, resulting in progressively more stable representations.

Here, we evaluated the feasibility of concurrent lipidomics and proteomics analyses from patient plasma cells, and report these data on a limited number of patient samples, demonstrating the feasibility of the method, and establishing hypotheses to be evaluated in the future.

MethodsPlasma cells were purified from fresh bone marrow aspirates using CD138 microbeads. Proteins and lipids were extracted using a bi-phasic solvent system with methanol, methyl tert-butyl ether, and water. Untargeted proteomics, untargeted and targeted lipidomics were performed on 7 patient samples using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. Two comparisons were conducted: high versus low risk; relapse versus newly diagnosed. Proteins and pathways enriched in the relapsed group was compared to a public transcriptomic dataset from Multiple Myeloma Research Consortium reference collection (n=222) at gene and pathways level.

ResultsFrom one million purified plasma cells, we were able to extract material and complete untargeted ([~]6000 and [~]3600 features in positive and negative mode respectively) and targeted lipidomics (313 lipids), as well as untargeted proteomics analysis ([~]4100 reviewed proteins). Comparative analyses revealed limited differences between high and low risk groups (according to the standard clinical criteria), hence we focused on drawing comparisons between the relapsed and newly diagnosed patients. Untargeted and targeted lipidomics indicated significant down-regulation of phosphatidylcholines (PCs) in relapsed MM. Although there was limited overlap of the differential proteins/transcripts, 76 significantly enriched pathways in relapsed MM were common between proteomics and transcriptomics data. Further evaluation of transcriptomics data for lipid metabolism network revealed enriched correlation of PC, ceramide, cardiolipin, arachidonic acid and cholesterol metabolism pathways to be exclusively correlated among relapsed but not in newly-diagnosed patients.

ConclusionsThis study establishes the feasibility and workflow to conduct integrated lipidomics and proteomics analyses on patient-derived plasma cells. Potential lipid metabolism changes associated with MM relapse warrant further investigation.",1,136,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/702993v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/702993v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_702993.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Diverging lineages often evolve highly heterogeneous patterns of differentiation; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. We used an integrated approach to investigate evolutionary processes governing genetic differentiation between the hybridizing campions (Silene dioica (L.) Clairv. and S. latifolia Poiret). Demographic modeling indicated that the two species diverged with continuous gene flow. The best-supported scenario with heterogeneity in both migration rate and effective population size suggested that 5% of the loci evolved without gene flow. Differentiation (FST) and sequence divergence (dXY) were correlated and both tended to peak in the middle of most linkage groups, consistent with reduced gene flow at highly differentiated loci. Highly differentiated loci further exhibited signatures of selection and differentiation was significantly elevated around previously identified QTLs associated with assortative mating. In between-species population pairs, isolation by distance was stronger for genomic regions with low between-species differentiation than for highly differentiated regions that may contain barrier loci. Moreover, differentiation landscapes within and between species were only weakly correlated suggesting that the interplay of background selection and conserved genomic features is not the dominant determinant of genetic differentiation in these lineages. Instead, our results suggest that divergent selection drove the evolution of barrier loci played and the genomic landscape of differentiation between the two species, consistent with predictions for speciation in the face of gene flow.",0,923,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/703108v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/703108v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_703108.txt,1,general-purpose repository,1,the variant  789  call format (vcf) file and perl codes for genetic analysis r codes for plotting and python  790  codes for demographical modeling will be submitted to dryad (project number to be added  791  after upload following acceptance).  792 793  32   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/703108; this version posted july 16 2019.,the variant  789  call format (vcf) file and perl codes for genetic analysis r codes for plotting and python  790  codes for demographical modeling will be submitted to dryad (project number to be added  791  after upload following acceptance).  792 793  32   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/703108; this version posted july 16 2019.

In normal conditions this activity is responsive to behavioural context, changing as an individual switches between directed tasks and task-free conditions. A key feature of such changes is the movement of the brain between corresponding critical and sub-critical states, with these dynamics supporting efficient cognitive processing. Breakdowns in processing efficiency can occur, however, in brain disorders such as depression. It was therefore hypothesised that depressive symptoms would be related to reduced intrinsic activity responsiveness to changes in behavioural state. This was tested in a mixed group of major depressive disorder patients (n = 26) and healthy participants (n = 37) by measuring intrinsic EEG activity temporal structure, quantified with detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), in eyes-closed and eyes-open task-free states and contrasting between the conditions. The degree to which DFA values changed between the states was found to be negatively correlated with depressive symptoms. DFA values did not differ between states at all in those with high symptom levels, meaning that the brain remained in a less flexible sub-critical condition. This sub-critical condition in the eyes-closed state was further found to correlate with levels of maladaptive rumination. This may reflect a general cognitive inflexibility resulting from a lack in neural activity reactivity that may predispose people to overly engage in self-directed attention. These results provide an initial link between intrinsic activity reactivity and psychological features found in psychiatric disorders.",1,851,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/703496v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/703496v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_703496.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here, we investigated the individual and combined effects of 18 years of warming and enhanced nitrogen and sulfate deposition on peat microbial communities in a nutrient-poor boreal mire. The three perturbations individually affected prokaryotic community composition, where nitrogen addition had the most pronounced effect, and its combination with the other perturbations led to additive effects. The functional potential of the community, characterized by shotgun metagenomics, was strongly affected by the interactive effects in the combined treatments. The responses in composition were also partly reflected in the functional gene repertoire and in altered carbon turnover, i.e. an increase of methane production rates as a result of nitrogen addition and a decrease with warming. Long-term nitrogen addition and warming-induced changes caused a shift from Sphagnum-dominated plant communities to vascular plant dominance, which likely transact with many of the observed microbial responses. We conclude that simultaneous perturbations do not always lead to synergistic effects, but can also counteract and even neutralize one another, and thus must be studied in combination when attempting to predict future characteristics and services of peatland ecosystems.",0,912,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/704411v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/704411v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_704411.txt,1,field-specific repository,1,298 299  nucleotide sequence accession numbers  300  the sequence data generated in this study was deposited to the ncbi sequence read archive  301  and is accessible through accession number prjeb14741.,available at https://githubcom/najoshi/sickle.

We have therefore used populations generated from crosses between Yumai 34 and four other wheat cultivars, three with average contents of AX (Ukrainka, Altigo and Claire) and one also having unusually high AX (Valoris), in order to map QTLs for soluble AX (determined as relative viscosity) of aqueous extracts of wholemeal flours) and total AX (determined by enzyme fingerprinting of white flour).

However, all four crosses showed strong QTLs for high RV/total AX on chromosome 1B, with Yumai 34 being the increasing parent, and a KASP marker for the high AX Yumai 34 allele was validated by analysis of high AX lines derived from Yumai 34 but selected by biochemical analysis. A QTL for RV was mapped on chromosome 6B in Yumai 34 x Valoris, with Valoris being the increasing allele, which was consistent with the observation of transgressive segregation for this trait.

The assay allows kinetic analysis of ligand-receptor binding in living HEK293 cells and competition binding experiments using commercially available SMO ligands (SANT-1, cyclopamine-KAAD, SAG1.3 and purmorphamine).\n\nKey ResultsThe NanoBRET binding assay for SMO is sensitive and superior to purely fluorescence-based binding assays.

The vey1 allele of Mo17 inbred line reduces chlorophyll content in the mutants leading to reduced photosynthetic output. Oy1-N1989 mutants in B73 reached reproductive maturity four days later than wild-type siblings. Enhancement of Oy1-N1989 by the Mo17 allele at the vey1 QTL delayed maturity further, resulting in detection of a flowering time QTL in two bi-parental mapping populations crossed to Oy1-N1989. The near isogenic lines of B73 harboring the vey1 allele from Mo17 delayed flowering of Oy1-N1989 mutants by twelve days. Just as previously observed for chlorophyll content, vey1 had no effect on reproductive maturity in the absence of the Oy1-N1989 allele. Loss of chlorophyll biosynthesis in Oy1-N1989 mutants and enhancement by vey1 reduced CO2 assimilation. We attempted to separate the effects of photosynthesis on the induction of flowering from a possible impact of chlorophyll metabolites and retrograde signaling by manually reducing leaf area.

The AID/APOBEC family genes (AID and APOBEC1-4) encode cellular cytosine deaminases that target nucleic acids and catalyze C-to-U mutations. In the case of retroviral replication, APOBEC3 proteins induce C-to-U mutations in minus-stranded viral DNA, which results in G-to-A mutations in the viral genome. Previous studies have indicated that the expansion and rapid evolution of mammalian APOBEC3 genes has been driven by an arms race with retroviral parasites, but this has not been thoroughly investigated. Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are retrotransposons originated from ancient retroviral infections. These sequences sometimes bear the hallmarks of APOBEC3-mediated mutations, and therefore serve as a record of the ancient conflict between retroviruses and APOBEC3 genes. Here we systematically investigated the sequences of ERVs and APOBEC3 genes in mammals to reconstruct details of the evolutionary conflict between them. We identified 1,420 AID/APOBEC family genes in a comprehensive screen of mammalian genome. Of the AID/APOBEC family genes, APOBEC3 genes have been selectively amplified in mammalian genomes and disclose evidence of strong positive selection - whereas the catalytic domain was highly conserved across species, the structure loop 7, which recognizes viral DNA/RNA substrates, was shown to be evolving under strong positive selection. Although APOBEC3 genes have been amplified by tandem gene duplication in most mammalian lineages, the retrotransposition-mediated gene amplification was found in several mammals including New World monkeys and prosimian primates. Comparative analysis revealed that G-to-A mutations are accumulated in ERVs, and that the G-to-A mutation signatures on ERVs is concordant with the target preferences of APOBEC3 proteins. Importantly, the number of APOBEC3 genes was significantly correlated with the frequency of G-to-A mutations in ERVs, suggesting that the amplification of APOBEC3 genes led to stronger attacks on ERVs and/or their ancestral retroviruses by APOBEC3 proteins. Furthermore, the numbers of APOBEC3 genes and ERVs in mammalian genomes were positively correlated, and in primates, the timings of APOBEC3 gene amplification was concordant with that of ERV invasions. Our findings suggest that conflict with ancient retroviruses was a major selective pressure driving the rapid evolution of APOBEC3 genes in mammals.",0,556,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/707190v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/707190v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_707190.txt,1,field-specific repository,1,it is made available under acc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license.  a  c  ua1 a1  a3z2  a4  ua2  a2  a3z1 a3z3 aid  0.1  b gene aid a1 a2 a3z1 a3z2 a3z3 a4 ua1 ua2 total  total 157 166 157 266 362 146 153 9 4 1420  intact 154 163 155 251 332 128 152 7 4 1350  pseudogenized 2 2 1 15 29 18 1 2 0 66  not determined 1 1 1 0 1 0 0 0 0 4  200 150 100 50 mya  capra hircus capra aegagrus capra sibirica pseudois nayaur ammotragus lervia ovis aries pantholops hodgsonii bos taurus bos indicus bos grunniens bubalus bubalis okapia johnstoni giraffa camelopardalis tippelskirchi odocoileus virginianus cervus elaphus hippelaphus neophocaena asiaeorientalis phocoena phocoena delphinapterus leucas tursiops truncatus tursiops aduncus orcinus orca lipotes vexillifer physeter catodon balaenoptera bonaerensis balaenoptera acutorostrata eschrichtius robustus hippopotamus amphibius sus scrofa camelus ferus camelus bactrianus camelus dromedarius vicugna pacos neovison vison mustela putorius furo enhydra lutris gulo gulo ailurus fulgens callorhinus ursinus odobenus rosmarus leptonychotes weddellii neomonachus schauinslandi ursus americanus ursus maritimus ailuropoda melanoleuca lycaon pictus canis familiaris canis lupus dingo vulpes vulpes felis catus puma concolor acinonyx jubatus panthera tigris altaica panthera pardus manis javanica manis pentadactyla equus caballus equus ferus przewalskii ceratotherium simum dicerorhinus sumatrensis rhinolophus sinicus rhinolophus ferrumequinum hipposideros armiger megaderma lyra pteropus vampyrus pteropus alecto rousettus aegyptiacus eidolon helvum myotis brandtii myotis lucifugus myotis davidii eptesicus fuscus miniopterus natalensis pteronotus parnellii desmodus rotundus erinaceus europaeus sorex araneus condylura cristata solenodon paradoxus woodi mus spicilegus mus musculus mus castaneus mus spretus mus caroli mus pahari apodemus speciosus apodemus sylvaticus rattus norvegicus meriones unguiculatus psammomys obesus microtus ochrogaster microtus agrestis ellobius talpinus ellobius lutescens mesocricetus auratus phodopus sungorus cricetulus griseus peromyscus maniculatus bairdii neotoma lepida nannospalax galili jaculus jaculus dipodomys ordii castor canadensis ictidomys tridecemlineatus marmota marmota marmota spermophilus dauricus octomys mimax octodon degus chinchilla lanigera cavia porcellus cavia aperea heterocephalus glaber fukomys damarensis oryctolagus cuniculus ochotona princeps mandrillus leucophaeus cercocebus atys papio anubis theropithecus gelada macaca fuscata macaca mulatta macaca fascicularis macaca nemestrina chlorocebus sabaeus rhinopithecus roxellana rhinopithecus bieti nasalis larvatus colobus angolensis palliatus pan troglodytes homo sapiens gorilla gorilla pongo abelii nomascus leucogenys callithrix jacchus aotus nancymaae saimiri boliviensis cebus capucinus tarsius syrichta eulemur macaco eulemur flavifrons prolemur simus propithecus coquereli microcebus murinus daubentonia madagascariensis otolemur garnettii galeopterus variegatus tupaia belangeri echinops telfairi chrysochloris asiatica elephantulus edwardii orycteropus afer trichechus manatus procavia capensis loxodonta africana dasypus novemcinctus choloepus hoffmanni phascolarctos cinereus macropus eugenii sarcophilus harrisii monodelphis domestica ornithorhynchus anatinus  0  aid a1 a2 a3z1 a3z2 a3z3 a4 ua1 ua2  artiodactyla  cetacea  artiodactyla  carnivora  pholidota perissodactyla  chiroptera  insectivora  muridae  rodentia  lagomorpha  catarrhini primates platyrrhini prosimi dermoptera scandentia afrotheria xenarthra marsupialia monotremata 0  10 20 number of intact z domain  30   figure 2 biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/707190;

In these cases, contributing nothing is a globally convergently stable finite-population ESS, implying that apparent evolution of cooperation in such games is an artifact of the infinite population approximation.

Here we show that expression of Casp-8 in endothelial cells (ECs) is required for proper postnatal angiogenesis. EC specific Casp-8 knockout pups (Casp-8ECko) have reduced retinal angiogenesis, as the loss of Casp-8 reduced EC proliferation, sprouting and migration independent of its cell death function. Instead, the loss of Casp-8 caused hyperactivation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) downstream of receptorinteracting serine/threonine-protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) and destabilization of VE-cadherin at EC junctions. In a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR), resembling retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), loss of Casp-8 in ECs is beneficial, as pathological neovascularization was reduced in Casp-8ECko pups.

We sequenced the genome of 82 strains and, together with other 25 available genomes, performed comprehensive phylogenetic analysis. Our results revealed the presence of three main Patagonia-B lineages together with dozens of admixed strains distributed in three mosaic clusters. The PB-1 lineage isolated from Tierra del Fuego exhibited the highest genetic diversity, lowest LD blocks and highest Fis values compared to the other lineages, suggesting a successful adaptation to cold temperatures in extreme environments and greater inbreeding rates in Tierra del Fuego. Differences between lineages and strains were found in terms of aneuploidy and pangenome content, evidencing a lateral gene transfer event in PB-2 strains from an unknown donor species. Overall, the Patagonian lineages, particularly southern populations, showed a greater global genetic diversity compared to Holarctic and Chinese lineages, supporting the scenario of a S. eubayanus colonization from Patagonia and then spread towards northern and western regions, including the Holarctic (North America and China) and New Zealand. Interestingly, fermentative capacity and maltose consumption resulted negatively correlated with latitude, indicating a better fermentative performance in norther populations. Our genome analysis together with previous reports in the sister species S. uvarum strongly suggests that the S. eubayanus ancestor could have originated in Patagonia or the Southern Hemisphere, rather than China, yet further studies are needed to resolve this conflicting scenario.

The increased scale of these methods led to a higher risk of cell doublets contamination. Available tools and algorithms for identifying doublets and estimating their occurrence in single-cell expression data focus on cell doublets from different species, cell types or individuals.\n\nResultsIn this study, we analyze transcriptomic data from single cells having an identical genetic background. We claim that the ratio of monoallelic to biallelic expression provides a discriminating power towards doublets identification. We present a pipeline called BIRD (BIallelic Ratio for Doublets) that relies on heterologous genetic variations extracted from single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). For each dataset, doublets were artificially created from the actual data and used to train a predictive model. BIRD was applied on Smart-Seq data from 163 primary fibroblasts. The model achieved 100% accuracy in annotating the randomly simulated doublets. Bonafide doublets from female-origin fibroblasts were verified by the unexpected biallelic expression from X-chromosome. Data from 10X Genomics microfluidics of peripheral blood cells analyzed by BIRD achieved in average 83% ({+/-} 3.7%) accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.88 ({+/-} 0.04) for a collection of [~]13,300 single cells.\n\nConclusionsBIRD addresses instances of doublets which were formed from cell mixtures of identical genetic background and cell identity.

AD is the leading cause of dementia. AD is preceded by mild cognitive impairment (MCI). By 2050, 68% of new dementia cases will occur in low- and middle-income countries. In the absence of objective biomarkers, psychological assessments are typically used to diagnose MCI and AD. However, these require specialist training and rely on subjective judgements. The need for low-cost, accessible and objective tools to aid AD and MCI diagnosis is therefore crucial. Electroencephalography (EEG) has potential as one such tool: it is relatively inexpensive (cf. magnetic resonance imaging; MRI) and is portable. In this study, we collected resting state EEG, structural MRI and rich neuropsychological data from older adults (55+ years) with AD, with MCI and from healthy controls (n~60 per group). Our goal was to evaluate the utility of EEG, relative to MRI, for the classification of MCI and AD. We also assessed the performance of combined EEG and behavioural (Mini-Mental State Examination; MMSE) and structural MRI classification models. Resting state EEG classified AD and HC participants with moderate accuracy (AROC=0.76), with lower accuracy when distinguishing MCI from HC participants (AROC=0.67). The addition of EEG data to MMSE scores had no additional value compared to MMSE alone. Structural MRI out-performed EEG (AD vs HC, AD vs MCI: AROCs=1.00; HC vs MCI: AROC=0.73). Resting state EEG does not appear to be a suitable tool for classifying AD.

It is widely accepted that aneurysm formation, enlargement and failure are associated with wall shear stress (WSS) which is exerted by flowing blood on the aneurysmal wall. To date, the combined effect of aneurysm size and wall elasticity on intra-aneurysm (IA) flow characteristics, particularly in the case of side-wall aneurysms, is poorly understood. Here we propose a model of three-dimensional viscous flow in a compliant artery containing an aneurysm by employing the immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann-finite element method. This model allows to adequately account for the elastic deformation of both the blood vessel and aneurysm walls. Using this model, we perform a detailed investigation of the flow through aneurysm under different conditions with a focus on the parameters which may influence the wall shear stress. Most importantly, it is shown in this work that the use of flow velocity as a proxy for wall shear stress is well justified only in those sections of the vessel which are close to the ideal cylindrical geometry. Within the aneurysm domain, however, the correlation between wall shear stress and flow velocity is largely lost due to the complexity of the geometry and the resulting flow pattern. Moreover, the correlations weaken further with the phase shift between flow velocity and transmural pressure. These findings have important implications for medical applications since wall shear stress is believed to play a crucial role in aneurysm rupture.",1,107,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/711564v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/711564v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_711564.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In particular the encapsulation and subsequent differentiation of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) is a strategy that holds great promise for the repair and regeneration of bone and cartilage. However, MSCs are well-known for their sensitivity to mechanical cues, particularly substrate stiffness, and so the inherent softness of hydrogels is poorly matched to the mechanical cues that drive efficient osteogenesis. This limits the success of bone tissue engineering using MSCs encapsulated in a hydrogel. One approach to overcome this limitation is to harness mechanotransductive signalling pathways and override the signals cells receive from their environment. Previous reports have shown that the mechanosensitive miRNAs, miR-100-5p and miR-143-3p can enhance MSC osteogenesis, but this required a complex multi-step procedure to transfect, encapsulate and differentiate the cells. In this study, we develop and characterise a facile system for in situ transfection of MSCs encapsulated within a light-crosslinkable gelatin-PEG hydrogel. Comparing the influence of different transfection agents and hydrogel compositions, we determine the factors affecting transfection agent release and MSC transfection, showing that it is possible to transfect MSCs with miRNAs in situ. We then compare the efficacy of both pretransfection and in situ transfection on the osteogenic capacity of hydrogel-encapsulated MSCs, demonstrating superior mineralisation and osteogenic gene expression for in situ transfected samples. Our platform therefore demonstrates a simple, one-pot system for delivery of pro-osteogenic miRNAs and in situ transfection that is able to enhance MSC osteogenic potential without the need of multi-step transfection procedures, thus demonstrating significant promise for bone tissue engineering.",1,963,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/712042v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/712042v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_712042.txt,1,supplement,0,all data is presented as mean ± sd n = 3. supplementary table 1,NA

We show that primary ZIKV infection generates high titers of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) that protect from detectable plasma viremia following rechallenge and persist for at least 27 months.

Despite the drop in ZIKV cases since the 2015-16 epidemic, questions concerning the prevalence and longevity of protective immunity have left vulnerable communities fearful that they may become the center of next ZIKV outbreak. While pre-existing herd immunity in regions of past outbreaks may dampen the potential for future outbreaks to occur, we currently do not know the longevity of protective immunity to ZIKV after a person becomes infected. Here, we establish a new experimentally defined minimal length of protective ZIKV immunity. We show that five rhesus macaques initially infected with ZIKV two years prior to rechallenge elicit a durable immune response that protected from detectable plasma viremia.

The complete network is a memory efficient implementation that is still able to resolve small root detail in large volumetric images. We evaluate our approach by comparing against a number of different encoder-decoder based architectures from the literature, as well as a popular existing image analysis tool designed for root CT segmentation.

On the one hand, loss aversion may be hardwired due to asymmetric evolutionary pressure on losses and gains and therefore exists across decision-making contexts. On the other hand, distinct brain regions are involved with different decision costs, making it questionable whether similar asymmetries exist. Here, we demonstrate that young healthy participants exhibit loss aversion during effort-based decision-making by exerting more physical effort in order to avoid punishment than to gain a same-size reward. Next, we show that medicated Parkinsons disease (PD) patients show a reduction in loss aversion compared to age-matched controls. Behavioural and computational analysis revealed that people with PD exerted similar physical effort in return for a reward, but were less willing to produce effort in order to avoid punishment. Therefore, loss aversion is present during effort-based decision-making and can be modulated by altered dopaminergic state. This finding could have important implications for our understanding of clinical disorders that show a reduced willingness to exert effort in the pursuit of reward.\n\nSignificance StatementLoss aversion - preferring to avoid punishment than to acquire equivalent reward - is an important concept in decision-making under risk. However, little is known about whether loss aversion also exists during decisions where the cost is physical effort. This is surprising given that motor cost shapes human behaviour, and a reduced willingness to exert effort is a characteristic of many clinical disorders. Here, we show that healthy individuals exert more effort to minimise punishment than to maximise reward (loss aversion). We also demonstrate that loss aversion is modulated by altered dopaminergic state by showing that medicated Parkinsons disease patients exert similar effort to gain reward but less effort to avoid punishment. Therefore, dopamine-dependent loss aversion is crucial for explaining effort-based decision-making.",1,503,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/714840v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/714840v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_714840.txt,1,general-purpose repository,0,the data and codes are available  240  at https://osf.io/hw4rk/.,NA

In mice injected with EV, inflammation was alleviated. Indeed, EVs regulated the levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-, IL-1{beta}, IFN-{gamma}, IL-6, and IL-10 in inflamed colons. However, when injected with TSG-6 depleted EV, the degree of inflammatory relief was reduced. Furthermore, TSG-6 in EVs plays a key role in increasing regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the colon.

The spinal cord also expresses all dopamine receptors however; how the specific receptors regulate spinal network output in mammals is poorly understood. We explore the receptor-specific mechanisms that underlie dopaminergic control of spinal network output of neonatal mice during changes in spinal network excitability. During spontaneous activity, which is a characteristic of developing spinal networks operating in a low excitability state, we found that dopamine is primarily inhibitory. We uncover an excitatory D1-mediated effect of dopamine on motoneurons and network output that also involves co-activation with D2 receptors. Critically, these excitatory actions require higher concentrations of dopamine; however, analysis of dopamine concentrations of neonates indicates that endogenous levels of spinal dopamine are low. Because endogenous levels of spinal dopamine are low, this excitatory dopaminergic pathway is likely physiologically-silent at this stage in development. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of dopamine, at low physiological concentrations is mediated by parallel activation of D2, D3, D4 and 2 receptors which is reproduced when endogenous dopamine levels are increased by blocking dopamine reuptake and metabolism. We provide evidence in support of dedicated spinal network components that are controlled by excitatory D1 and inhibitory D2 receptors that is reminiscent of the classic dopaminergic indirect and direct pathway within the striatum. These results indicate that network state is an important factor that dictates receptor-specific and therefore dose-dependent control of neuromodulators on spinal network output and advances our understanding of how neuromodulators regulate neural networks under dynamically changing excitability.\n\nSignificance statementMonoaminergic neuromodulation of neural networks is dependent not only on target receptors but also on network state. We studied the concentration-dependent control of spinal networks of the neonatal mouse, in vitro, during a low excitability state characterized by spontaneous network activity. Spontaneous activity is an essential element for the development of networks. Under these conditions, we defined converging receptor and cellular mechanisms that contribute to the diverse, concentration-dependent control of spinal motor networks by dopamine, in vitro. These experiments advance understanding of how monoamines modulate neuronal networks under dynamically changing excitability conditions and provide evidence of dedicated D1 and D2 regulated network components in the spinal cord that are consistent with those reported in the striatum.",1,159,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/715326v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/715326v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_715326.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Multiple fixed points in a network of such bistable units can be used to model memory retrieval and pattern separation. The stability of fixed points may change on a slower timescale than that of the dynamics due to short-term synaptic depression, leading to transitions between quasi-stable point attractor states in a sequence that depends on the history of stimuli. To better understand these behaviors, we study a minimal model, which characterizes multiple fixed points and transitions between them in response to stimuli with diverse time- and amplitude-dependences. The interplay between the fast dynamics of firing rate and synaptic responses and the slower timescale of synaptic depression makes the neural activity sensitive to the amplitude and duration of square-pulse stimuli in a non-trivial, history-dependent manner. Weak cross-couplings further deform the basins of attraction for different fixed points into intricate shapes.

Some neurites undergo stereotyped and developmentally regulated pruning. However, the signaling cues that instruct stereotyped neurite pruning are yet to be fully elucidated. Here we show that Wnt morphogen instructs stereotyped neurite pruning for proper neurite projection patterning of the cholinergic motor neuron called PDB in C. elegans. In the loss of lin-44/wnt and lin-17/frizzled mutant animals, the PDB neurites often failed to prune and grew towards the lin-44-expressing cells. Surprisingly, membrane-tethered lin-44 is sufficient to induce proper neurite pruning in PDB, suggesting that neurite pruning does not require Wnt gradient.

Staphylococcus aureus has the BraRS-VraDE system providing resistance against low concentrations of nisin A. The BraRS is one of a two-component system that senses nisin A by BraS and finally induces the expression of ABC transporter VraDE by phosphorylated BraR. Previously, we isolated a highly nisin A resistant strain with increased VraDE expression due to a mutation of braRS. In this study, we isolated a BraRS-VraDE-independent, nisin A resistant mutant from S. aureus MW2. These mutants, designated SAN2 (S. aureus nisin resistant) and SAN469, had a mutation in pmtR (MW1875) which encodes a transcriptional regulator responsible for the expression of the pmtA-D operon. As a result, this mutant exhibited a high level of constitutive production of PmtA-D, a transporter responsible for the export of phenol soluble modulin (PSM). We also obtained two pmtA-D overexpressing, nisin A resistant mutants which contained a point mutation in pmtR from other S. aureus strains.\n\nCharacterization of the mutants revealed that they have a decreased susceptibility to human beta defensin-3 and LL37, which are innate immune factors. Additionally, these mutants showed higher hemolytic activity than the MW2 original strain. Furthermore, in a mouse bacteremia model, the SAN2 strain exhibited a lower survival rate than the MW2 original strain. These results indicate that the over expression of pmtA-D due to the pmtR mutation is an alternative nisin A resistance, which also affects virulence in S. aureus.\n\nAuthor SummaryRecently, the emergence of antibiotic resistant bacteria such as MRSA, MDRP and CRE have brought serious problems for chemotherapy in the world. In addition, many antibacterial agents such as disinfectants and food additives are widely used. Therefore, it raises the possibility that bacteria are becoming resistant to all antibacterial agents. In this study, we investigated whether S. aureus become resistant against nisin A, one of the food additives. Finally, we isolated nisin A highly resistant S. aureus strains. Among these strains, we identified that one strain designated as SAN2 showed nisin A resistance by the overproduction of Pmts which were involved in the secretion of virulence factors called PSMs. We identified a mutation of pmtR gene encoding a regulator for pmt genes. SAN2 strain showed the decreased susceptibility to human antimicrobial peptides and the increased hemolytic activity. Finally, SAN2 showed higher lethal activity in mouse bacteremia model.

Cell polarity plays a crucial role in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and its disruption leads to neoplastic cancer progression. However, the underlying mechanisms by which loss of cell-polarity regulators drives cancer progression are poorly known. In this study, we have explored the tumor progression mechanisms upon scrib knockdown in Drosophila wing imaginal disc using UASRNAi-GAL4 approach. We have found that scrib knockdown in wing disc leads to tumor growth with disrupted actin cytoskeleton, loss of cell-polarity and elevated JNK signalling, resulting in absolute early pupal lethality. Further, scrib abrogated cells in a large area of the disc are capable of invading the surrounding wild type cells and inducing apoptosis along with compensatory proliferation through JNK-Wnt pathways. Moreover, JNK pathway upstream candidate hep (JNKK) knockdown in scrib abrogated cells rescues the cell polarity defects, actin cytoskeleton disruption and tumor growth, while constitutive hep activation further aggravates the tumor phenotype. Interestingly, generation of undead cells by apoptosis inhibition in these hep knockdown cells by p35 expression further leads to tumor development. Hence, we conclude that scrib knockdown in a large area of wing disc might have a  group-protection and  undead-cells microenvironment that modulates the action of JNK signalling resulting in tumor formation. Furthermore, JNK dependent activation of Wnt/Ca2+ signalling also supports the tumor growth and actin cytoskeleton disruption.

Our previous report of L. amazonensis-induced PD-L1 expression on dendritic cells, in combination with decreased IFN-{gamma} production by CD4+ T cells in C57BL/6 mice, led to a hypothesis that the formation of the PD-1/PD-L1 complex contributes to down-modulation of immune responses, especially T cell suppression, enabling parasite survival and persistence. In this study, we tested the therapeutic potential of anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) against a non-healing L. amazonensis infection in BALB/c mice.

However, numerous studies in monkeys have reported that gustatory cortical neurons are broadly-tuned to multiple tastes, and tastes are not represented in discrete spatial locations. Neuroimaging studies in humans have thus far been unable to discern between these two models, though this may be due to the relatively low spatial resolution employed in taste studies to date. In the present study, we examined the spatial representation of taste within the human brain using ultra-high resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at high magnetic field strength (7-Tesla). During scanning, participants tasted sweet, salty, sour and tasteless liquids, delivered via a custom-built MRI-compatible tastant-delivery system.

We found that a structural damping model, not a viscoelastic model, accurately describes the thoraxs linear spring-like properties and frequency independent dissipation. The energy recovered from thorax deformations is sufficient to minimize flight power requirements. By removing the passive musculature, we find that the exoskeleton determines thorax mechanics. To assess the factors that determine the exoskeletons spring-like properties, we isolated functional thorax regions, disrupted strain in an otherwise intact thorax, and compared results to a homogeneous hemisphere.

Using DNA methylation (DNAm) clocks, we investigated biological aging in schizophrenia (SCZ), a severe mental illness that is associated with an increased prevalence of age-related disabilities and morbidities. In a multi-cohort whole blood sample consisting of 1,090 SCZ cases and 1,206 controls, we investigated differential aging using three DNAm clocks (i.e. Hannum, Horvath, Levine). These clocks are highly predictive of chronological age and are known to capture different processes of biological aging.

ResultsWe found that blood-based DNAm aging is significantly altered in SCZ with age- and sex-specific effects that differ between clocks and map to distinct chronological age windows. Most notably, differential phenotypic age (Levine clock) was most pronounced in female SCZ patients in later adulthood compared to matched controls. Female patients with high SCZ polygenic risk scores (PRS) present the highest age acceleration in this age group with +4.30 years (CI: 2.40-6.20, P=1.3E-05). Phenotypic age and SCZ PRS contribute additively to the illness and together explain up to 22.4% of the variance in disease status in this study. This suggests that combining genetic and epigenetic predictors may improve predictions of disease outcomes.

ConclusionsSince increased phenotypic age is associated with increased risk of all-cause mortality, our findings indicate that specific and identifiable patient groups are at increased mortality risk as measured by the Levine clock. These results provide new biological insights into the aging landscape of SCZ with age- and sex-specific effects and warrant further investigations into the potential of DNAm clocks as clinical biomarkers that may help with disease management in schizophrenia.",0,942,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/727859v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/727859v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_727859.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here, we report the discovery of the pathways for FOR-A and PRF-A biosynthesis from diverse actinobacteria, and demonstrate that their biosynthesis is initiated by a lysine N6-monooxygenase. Moreover, we show that the forT and prfE (individually related to FOR-A and PRF-A biosynthesis) mutants are correspondingly capable of accumulating the unexpected pyrazole-related intermediates, compound 11 and 9a.

However, current experimental methods of cell type quantification (e.g. cell flow cytometry) are costly, time consuming, and can introduce bias. Computational approaches that infer cell type abundance from expression data offer an alternate solution. While these methods have gained popularity, most are limited to predicting hematopoietic cell types and do not produce accurate predictions for stromal cell types. Many of these methods are also limited to particular platforms, whether RNA-seq or specific microarrays. We present the Gene Expression Deconvolution Interactive Tool (GEDIT), a tool that overcomes these limitations, compares favorably with existing methods, and provides superior versatility. Using both simulated and experimental data, we extensively evaluate the performance of GEDIT and demonstrate that it returns robust results under a wide variety of conditions. These conditions include a variety of platforms (microarray and RNA-seq), tissue types (blood and stromal), and species (human and mouse). Finally, we provide reference data from eight sources spanning a wide variety of stromal and hematopoietic types in both human and mouse. This reference database allows the user to obtain estimates for a wide variety of tissue samples without having to provide their own data. GEDIT also accepts user submitted reference data, thus allowing the estimation of any cell type or subtype, provided that reference data is available.

Author SummaryThe Gene Expression Deconvolution Interactive Tool (GEDIT) is a robust and accurate tool that uses gene expression data to estimate cell type abundances. Extensive testing on a variety of tissue types and technological platforms demonstrates that GEDIT provides greater versatility than other cell type deconvolution tools. GEDIT utilizes reference data describing the expression profile of purified cell types, and we provide in the software package a library of reference matrices from various sources. GEDIT is also flexible and allows the user to supply custom reference matrices.

During this process, one major event is innervation of the gut by enteric neural crest cells (ENCC) to establish the enteric nervous system (ENS). To understand the molecular processes underpinning gut and ENS development, we generated RNA-seq profiles from wildtype mouse guts at E10.5, E12.5 and E14.5 from both sexes. We also generated these profiles from homozygous Ret null embryos, a model for Hirschsprung disease (HSCR), in whom the ENS is absent. These data reveal four major features: (1) between E10.5 to E14.5 the developmental genetic programs change from expression of major transcription factors (TF) and its modifiers to genes controlling tissue (epithelium, muscle, endothelium) specialization; (2) the major effect of Ret is not only on ENCC differentiation to enteric neurons but also on the enteric mesenchyme and epithelium; (3) a muscle genetic program exerts significant effects on ENS development, and (4) sex differences in gut development profiles are minor. The genetic programs identified, and their changes across development, suggests that both cell autonomous and non-autonomous factors, and interactions between the different developing gut tissues, are important for normal ENS development and its disorders.\n\nSignificance statementThe mammalian gut is a complex set of tissues formed during development by orchestrating the timing of expression of many genes.

Recently, fatty acid auxotrophy of AM fungi is supported by studies showing that lipids synthesized by the host plants are transferred to the fungi and that the latter lack genes encoding cytosolic fatty acid synthases (1-7). Therefore, to establish an asymbiotic cultivation system for AM fungi, we tried to identify the fatty acids that could promote biomass production. To determine whether AM fungi can grow on medium supplied with fatty acids or lipids under asymbiotic conditions, we tested eight saturated or unsaturated fatty acids (C12-C18) and two {beta}-monoacylglycerols. Only myristate (C14:0) led to an increase in biomass of Rhizophagus irregularis, inducing extensive hyphal growth and formation of infection-competent secondary spores. However, such spores were smaller than those generated symbiotically. Furthermore, we demonstrated that R. irregularis can take up fatty acids in its branched hyphae and use myristate as a carbon and energy source. Myristate also promoted the growth of Rhizophagus clarus and Gigaspora margarita. Finally, mixtures of myristate and palmitate accelerated fungal growth and induced a substantial change in fatty acid composition of triacylglycerol compared with single myristate application, although palmitate was not used as a carbon source for cell wall biosynthesis in this culture system. In conclusion, here we demonstrate that myristate boosts asymbiotic growth of AM fungi and can also serve as a carbon and energy source.

Significance statementThe origins of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, which form symbiotic associations with land plants, date back over 460 million years ago. During evolution, these fungi acquired an obligate symbiotic lifestyle, and thus depend on their host for essential nutrients. In particular, fatty acids are regarded as crucial nutrients for the survival of AM fungi owing to the absence of genes involved in de novo fatty acid biosynthesis in the AM fungal genomes that have been sequenced so far. Here, we show that myristate initiates AM fungal growth under asymbiotic conditions. These findings will advance pure culture of AM fungi.",1,679,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/731489v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/731489v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_731489.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, most studies of eQTL mapping have not implemented models that allow for the non-equivalence of parental alleles as so-called parent-of-origin effects (POEs); thus, the number and effects of imprinted genes remain important open questions. Imprinting is a type of POE that the expression of certain genes depends on their allelic parent-of-origin which are important contributors to phenotypic variations, such as diabetes and many cancer types. Besides, multi-collinearity is an important issue arising from modeling multiple genetic effects. To address these challenges, we proposed a statistical framework to test the main allelic effects of the candidate eQTLs along with the POE with an orthogonal model for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. Using simulations, we demonstrated the desirable power and Type I error of the orthogonal model which also achieved accurate estimation of the genetic effects and over-dispersion of the RNA-seq data. These methods were applied to an existing HapMap project trio dataset to validate the reported imprinted genes and to discovery novel imprinted genes. Using the orthogonal method, we validated existing imprinting genes and discovered two novel imprinting genes with significant dominance effect.\n\nAuthor SummaryIn the past decades, an unprecedented wealth of knowledge has been accumulated for understanding variations in human DNA level. However, this DNA-level knowledge has not been sufficiently translated to understanding the mechanisms of human diseases. Gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping is one of the most promising approaches to fill this gap, which aims to explore the genetic basis of gene expression. Genomic imprinting is an important epigenetic phenomenon which is an important contributor to phenotypic variation in human complex diseases and may explain some of the \""hidden\"" heritable variability. Many imprinting genes are known to play important roles in human complex diseases such as diabetes, breast cancer and obesity. However, traditional eQTL mapping approaches does not allow for the detection of imprinting which is usually involved in gene expression imbalance. In this study, we have for the first time demonstrated the orthogonal statistical model can be applied to eQTL mapping for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data. We showed by simulated and real data that the orthogonal model outperformed the usual functional model for detecting main effects in most cases, which addressed the issue of confounding between the dominance and additive effects. Application of the statistical model to the HapMap data resulted in discovery of some potential eQTLs with imprinting effects and dominance effects on expression of RB1 and IGF1R genes.\n\nIn summary, we developed a comprehensive framework for modeling imprinting effect for eQTL mapping, by decomposing the effects to multiple genetic components. This study is providing new insights into statistical modeling of eQTL mapping with RNA-seq data which allows for uncorrelated parameter estimation of genetic effects, covariates and over-dispersion parameter.",0,787,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/732792v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/732792v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_732792.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The Californian tree, coast redwood (Sequoia sempervirens [D. Don] Endl.) is one of such species due to its excellent wood properties and high growth rate. It is sensitive to the freezing temperatures, but several trees of unknown origin introduced to Germany decades ago demonstrated high frost tolerance, and their propagated cuttings were planted all over German botanic gardens and arboreta. The knowledge of their origin within the natural distribution range could help us identify the potential genetic resources of frost resistant coast redwood genotypes. Therefore, both trees of unknown origin in Germany (G) and two reference data sets representing the \""Kuser provenance test\"" established in 1990 in France (F) and samples collected in California (C) with known origin were genotyped using 18 microsatellite markers including 12 nuclear and six chloroplast simple sequence repeat (cpSSR) markers. The number of haplotypes found in the data sets based on six cpSSR markers was surprisingly very high. These markers were used to assign the German frost resistant trees (G) to the two reference data sets (F and C). The genetic structure among California samples (C) based on nSSR and cpSSR markers was very weak and mainly due to northern and southern clusters separated by the San Francisco Bay as a geographic barrier between coast redwood populations confirming previously published data. It was impossible to confidently assign frost tolerant trees (G) to single native populations, but rather to either the northern or southern cluster. However, the existing frost tolerant genotypes can already be used to establish commercial coast redwood plantation for future German forestry.",1,780,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/732834v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/732834v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_732834.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

An example of a synthesis pathway strongly dependent on external conditions is the production of storage lipids, which typically requires high carbon/nitrogen ratio. Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 is known for its ability to produce industrially interesting storage lipids, namely wax esters (WEs). Here, we engineered the central carbon metabolism of A. baylyi ADP1 by deletion of the gene aceA encoding for isocitrate lyase in order to allow redirection of carbon towards WEs. The production was further enhanced by overexpression of fatty acyl-CoA reductase Acr1 in the wax ester production pathway. This strategy led to 3-fold improvement in yield (0.075 g/g glucose) and 3.15-fold improvement in titer (1.82 g/L) and productivity (0.038 g/L/h) by a simple one-stage batch cultivation with glucose as carbon source. The engineered strain accumulated up to 27% WEs of cell dry weight. The titer and cellular WE content are the highest reported to date among microbes. We further showed that the engineering strategy alleviated the inherent requirement for high carbon/nitrogen ratio and demonstrated the production of wax esters using nitrogen-rich substrates including casamino acids, yeast extract and bakers yeast hydrolysate, which support biomass production but not WE production in wild-type cells.

Group living can be facilitated by social tolerance and cooperation among the group members. Social canids (e.g. wolves) display cooperative breeding, hunting, and prosocial activities in different contexts. Unlike cooperative pack-living wolves (Canis lupus lupus), their descendants, domesticated dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), show varying levels of associations from solitary to stable social groups. Free-ranging dogs are group-living but prefer to forage solitarily, hence providing an excellent opportunity for investigating social tolerance and coordinated task performance among the members in various situations. We tested 113 adult-only groups of free-ranging dogs in three different tasks to investigate group responses and performance in problem-solving situations in the presence of an unfamiliar human. Task 1 (unfamiliar, single food reward) and 2 (familiar, single food reward) examined group responses and cooperation from the perspective of familiarity, while Task 3 (familiar, multiple food rewards) enabled us to test whether increased food rewards promote social tolerance and food sharing among the group members. Regardless of significantly higher performance in Task 2 compared to Task 1, cooperation and food sharing were significantly lower in both. Task 3 revealed a strong positive correlation between food sharing and social tolerance, but not between success and social tolerance, suggesting a tendency for cooperation. We conclude that context-dependent cooperation and tolerance among group members facilitate group-living in free-ranging dogs.\n\nSignificance statementGroup living is a common phenomenon in the animal world where the members of a group show social tolerance and co-operative behaviours towards each other. This need for cooperative intents increases manifolds while groups face different problem-solving situations in their day to day lives. Here, we tested a large number of free-ranging dog groups to understand general cooperative intents such as social tolerance and food sharing in different problem-solving conditions. We found shreds of evidence of context-dependent cooperation and social tolerance among group members with minimal display of aggression. It is not adaptive for the dogs to fight or display aggression over resources. Alternatively, use of subtle cues such as display of dominance and subordination seem to be more plausible mechanisms for the development of efficient scavenging strategies and maintaining hierarchy.",0,511,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/736009v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/736009v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_736009.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, some plant pathogens are difficult or impossible to grow in axenic cultures. A molecular methodology capable of detecting living fungi and fungus-like organisms in situ can provide a solution. RNA represents the transcription of genes and can therefore only be produced by living organisms, providing a proxy for viability. We designed and used RNA-based molecular diagnostic assays targeting genes essential to vital processes and assessed their presence in wood colonized by fungi and oomycetes through reverse transcription and real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A stability analysis was conducted by comparing the ratio of mRNA to gDNA over time following heat treatment of wood infected with the Oomycete Phytophthora ramorum and the fungus Grosmannia clavigera. The real-time PCR results indicated that the DNA remained stable over a period of 10 days post treatment in heat-treated wood samples, whereas mRNA could not be detected after 24 hours for P. ramorum or 96 hours for G. clavigera. Therefore, this method provides a reliable way to evaluate the viability of these pathogens and test the effectiveness of existing and emerging wood treatments.

To address this question, we developed an in vitro assay, where microtubules were made to deliver His-tagged plus-end tracking proteins to functionalized microchamber walls. We found that motor-mediated protein clusters formed at microtubule ends were able to transfer to the walls, but non-clustered proteins were not.

Using syntR, and we identify blocks of synteny between these two subspecies and previously published high-density genetic maps. We reconstruct ancestral karyotypes for annual sunflowers using those synteny blocks and conservatively estimate that there have been 7.9 chromosomal rearrangements per million years - a high rate of chromosomal evolution. Although the rate of inversion is even higher than the rate of translocation in this group, we further find that every extant karyotype is distinguished by between 1 and 3 translocations involving only 8 of the 17 chromosomes.

Despite this, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning the sexually dimorphic control of bone quality remain unclear, limiting our ability to effectively prevent fractures, especially in postmenopausal osteoporosis. Recently, using male mice, we found that systemic or osteocyte-intrinsic inhibition of TGF{beta} signaling, achieved using the 9.6-kb DMP1 promoter-driven Cre recombinase (T{beta}RIIocy-/- mice), suppresses osteocyte perilacunar/canalicular remodeling (PLR) and compromises bone quality. Since systemic TGF{beta} inhibition more robustly increases bone mass in female than male mice, we postulated that sex-specific differences in bone quality could likewise result, in part, from dimorphic regulation of PLR by TGF{beta}. Moreover, since lactation induces PLR, we examined the effect of TGF{beta} inhibition on the female skeleton during lactation. In contrast to males, female mice that possess an osteocyte-intrinsic defect in TGF{beta} signaling were protected from TGF{beta}-dependent defects in PLR and bone quality. The expression of requisite PLR enzymes, the lacuno-canalicular network, and the flexural strength of female T{beta}RIIocy-/- bone was intact. With lactation, however, bone loss, and induction in PLR and osteocytic parathyroid hormone type I receptor (PTHR1) expression, were suppressed in T{beta}RIIocy-/- bone, relative to wild-type. Indeed, differential control of PTHR1 expression, by TGF{beta} and other factors, may contribute to dimorphism in PLR regulation in male and female T{beta}RIIocy-/- mice. These findings provide key insights into the sex-based differences in osteocyte PLR that underlie bone quality and highlight TGF{beta} signaling as a crucial regulator of lactation-induced PLR.",1,585,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/737395v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/737395v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_737395.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Understanding the mechanisms that drive social network dynamics requires integrating individual-level biology with comparisons across multiple social networks.
C_LIO_LITestosterone is a key mediator of vertebrate social behavior and can influence how individuals interact with social partners. Although the effects of testosterone on individual behavior are well established, no study has examined whether hormone-mediated behavior can scale up to shape the emergent properties of social networks.
C_LIO_LIWe investigated the relationship between testosterone and social network dynamics in the wire-tailed manakin, a lekking bird species in which male-male social interactions form complex social networks. We used an automated proximity system to longitudinally monitor several leks and we quantified the social network structure at each lek. Our analysis examines three emergent properties of the networks: social specialization (the extent to which a network is partitioned into exclusive partnerships), network stability (the overall persistence of partnerships through time), and behavioral assortment (the tendency for like to associate with like). All three properties are expected to promote the evolution of cooperation. As the predictor, we analyzed the collective testosterone of males within each social network.
C_LIO_LISocial networks that were composed of high-testosterone dominant males were less specialized, less stable, and had more negative behavioral assortment, after accounting for other factors. These results support our main hypothesis that individual-level hormone physiology can predict group-level network dynamics. We also observed that larger leks with more interacting individuals had more positive behavioral assortment, suggesting that small groups may constrain the processes of homophily and behavior-matching.
C_LIO_LIOverall, these results provide evidence that hormone-mediated behavior can shape the broader architecture of social groups. Groups with high average testosterone exhibit social network properties that are predicted to impede the evolution of cooperation.

Our previous analyses of R349P desmin knock-in mice, an animal model for the human R350P desminopathy, already depicted pre-clinical changes in myofibrillar arrangement and increased fiber bundle stiffness compatible with a pre-aged phenotype in the disease. Since the specific effect of R349P desmin on axial biomechanics in fully differentiated muscle fibers is unknown, we used our automated MyoRobot biomechatronics platform to compare passive and active biomechanics in single fibers derived from fast- and slow-twitch muscles from adult to senile mice hetero- or homozygous for this desmin mutation with wild-type littermates. Experimental protocols involved caffeine-induced Ca2+-mediated force transients, pCa-force curves, resting length-tension curves, visco-elasticity and  slack-tests. We demonstrate that the presence of R349P desmin predominantly increased single fiber axial stiffness in both muscle types with a pre-aged phenotype over wild-type fibers. Axial viscosity was unaffected. Likewise, no systematic changes in Ca2+-mediated force properties were found. Notably, mutant single fibers showed faster unloaded shortening over wild-type fibers.

Surprisingly, consistent differences in neither gene ratio nor relative diversity between the subgenomes were detected between these two types of polyploid genotypes although they differ in times exposed to evolutional selection. As expected, the estimated ratio of retained genes between a subgenome and its diploid donor was invariably higher for the artificial allopolyploid genotypes due likely to the presence of variable genome components (VGC). Clearly, the presence of VGC means that exaggerated differences between a donor and a subgenome in a polyploid are inevitable when random genotypes were used to represent species of either a polyploid or its donors. SA was also detected in genotypes before the completion of the polyploidization events as well as in those which were not formed via polyploidization.

We show here that increasing the methylphosphonate neutral DNA from 10 nucleotides in the previous report, to 20 nucleotides, reveals that CMG encircling duplex DNA only interacts with the tracking strand compared to the non-tracking strand. This significantly enhances support that CMG tracks on duplex DNA by binding only one strand. Furthermore, EMSA assays using AMPPNP to load CMG onto DNA shows a stoichiometry of only 2 CMGs on an origin mimic DNA, containing a 150 bp duplex with two 3 prime single-strand (ss) tails, one on each end, enabling assay of dsDNA unwinding by a shearing force produced by only two head-to-head CMGs. The use of non-hydrolysable AMPPNP enabled a preincubation for CMG binding the two 3 prime tailed origin mimic DNA, and gave robust unwinding of dsDNA by head-to-head CMG-Mcm10s.

Being mostly non-functional, and accumulating mutations more slowly than mitochondrial sequence, they act like molecular fossils - they preserve information on the ancestral sequences of the mitochondrial DNA. In addition, changes to the Numt sequence since their insertion into the nuclear genome carry information about the nuclear phylogeny. These attributes cannot be reliably exploited if Numt sequence is confused with the mitochondrial genome (mtDNA). The analysis of mtDNA would be similarly compromised by any confusion, for example producing misleading results in DNA barcoding that used mtDNA sequence. We propose a method to distinguish Numts from mtDNA, without the need for comprehensive assembly of the nuclear genome or the physical separation of organelles and nuclei. It exploits the different biases of long and short-read sequencing. We find that short-read data yield mainly mtDNA sequences, whereas long-read sequencing strongly enriches for Numt sequences. We demonstrate the method using genome-skimming (coverage < 1x) data obtained on Illumina short-read and PacBio long-read technology from DNA extracted from six grasshopper individuals. The mitochondrial genome sequences were assembled from the short-read data despite the presence of Numts. The PacBio data contained a much higher proportion of Numt reads (over 16-fold), making us caution against the use of long-read methods for studies using mitochondrial loci.

FXR-/-mice displayed greater liver damage and inflammatory responses than WT mice, characterized by significant increases in liver weight, serum AST and ALT, hepatocyte apoptosis and liver inflammatory cytokines. Liver IRI increased expression of X box binding protein 1 (XBP1) and FGF21 in WT liver, but not in FXR-/- liver, which conversely increased CHOP expression, suggesting a loss of ER stress protection in the absence of FXR. FXR deficiency increased circulating total BAs and altered BA composition with reduced TUDCA and hepatic BA synthesis markers. FXR deficiency also reshaped gut microbiota composition with increased Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria and decreased Firmicutes. Curiously, Bacteroidetes were positively and Firmicutes were negatively correlated with serum ALT levels.

Here we aimed to (1) evaluate effects of demographic and management factors as well as personality traits on stress reactivity of sport horses, (2) investigate if elite sport horses have elevated stress levels compared to amateur sport horses, and (3) assess whether different equestrian disciplines differentially influence horses adrenal cortex responsiveness. For this purpose, we visited 149 healthy elite (n=94) and amateur (n=54) sport horses in Switzerland and performed an adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test. Additionally, a person who was familiar with the horse completed a questionnaire about demographic and management factors and horses personality traits. Linear models were calculated to assess associations between the questionnaire data and salivary cortisol 60 and 90 minutes after ACTH stimulation. While the model at T90 was not significant, post-stimulatory cortisol after 60 min appears most informative in line with a previous study and was significantly affected by the horses breed and by three management factors: ""number of riders"", ""hours spent outside"" and ""group housing"" (adjusted r2 =15%, p<0.001). Thoroughbred and Warmblood horses displayed an increased adrenal response compared to Franches-Montagnes horses. Horses with several riders had a less pronounced reaction than horses with one rider, and horses that spent more time outside had a decreased response compared to horses that were stabled most of the time. Horses living in groups showed higher post-stimulatory cortisol values than horses that were housed singly. However, no significant associations of cortisol responsiveness with personality traits were found, and neither the horses use as elite or as amateur sport horses nor the discipline had an effect on the cortisol response.

Like many agricultural crops, the interaction between pollen-source variety and pollen-recipient variety can be a major determinant of fruit quality in blueberries. However, little information exists to guide growers in optimising fruit set and quality. Using five commonly grown blueberry varieties, I determined whether crossing between varieties (inter-varietal) increased fruit mass and decreased developmental time relative to crossing within a variety (intra-varietal), and if so, what the best crossing combinations are. While intra-varietal pollination often produced fruit, for certain varieties the fruit set and fruit mass were highly reduced compared to inter-varietal pollination. Furthermore, intra-varietal pollination resulted in longer fruit developmental time in comparison to pollination between varieties. For the same pollen-recipient variety, inter-varietal crosses typically outperformed intra-varietal crosses in fruit mass and developmental time; however, the extent to which inter-varietal crosses outperformed intra-varietal crosses differed between pollen-donor varieties. This result suggests that combinations of varieties are not trivial as some inter-varietal combinations may outperform others. Furthermore, some varieties appear to be more susceptible to the negative effects of intra-varietal crosses than others and that less susceptible varieties may be better suited to conditions where pollinator movement is poor. While our study can guide growers in determining optimal co-planting schemes for the varieties tested, for example in South Africa where these varieties are frequently grown.

Several linked-read sequencing technologies, including 10X linked-read, TELL-Seq, and single tube long fragment read (stLFR), have been recently developed as cost-effective approaches to reconstruct multi-megabase haplotypes (phase blocks) from sequence data of a single sample. These technologies provide an optimal sequencing platform to characterize SVs, though few computational algorithms can utilize them. Thus, we developed Aquila_stLFR, an approach that resolves SVs through haplotype-based assembly of stLFR linked-reads.

ResultsAquila_stLFR first partitions LFRs into two haplotype-specific blocks, by taking advantage of the potential phasing ability of the linked-read itself. Each haplotype is then assembled independently, to achieve a complete diploid assembly to finally reconstruct the genome-wide SVs. We benchmarked Aquila_stLFR on a well-studied sample, NA24385, and showed Aquila_stLFR can detect medium to large size (50bp - 10kb) deletions with a high sensitivity and insertions with a high specificity.

Here, we show that nutrient-stimulated histone acetylation plays a key role in adapting insulin secretion through regulation of genes involved in {beta}-cell nutrient sensing and metabolism. Nutrient regulation of the epigenome occurs at sites occupied by the chromatin-modifying enzyme Lsd1 in islets. We demonstrate that {beta}-cell-specific deletion of Lsd1 leads to insulin hypersecretion, aberrant expression of nutrient response genes, and histone hyperacetylation. Islets from mice adapted to chronically increased insulin demand exhibited similar epigenetic and transcriptional changes. Moreover, genetic variants associated with fasting glucose and type 2 diabetes are enriched at LSD1-bound sites in human islets, suggesting that interpretation of nutrient signals is genetically determined.

Compensatory dynamics, in which anti-synchronous fluctuations between populations buffer against fluctuations at the community level, is a key theoretical mechanism of stability. Classically, compensatory dynamics have been quantified using a \""variance ratio\"" approach that compares the ratio between community variance and aggregate population variance, such that a lower ratio indicates compensation and a higher ratio indicates synchrony among species fluctuations. However, population dynamics may be influenced by different drivers that operate on different timescales, and evidence from aquatic systems indicates that communities can be compensatory on some timescales and synchronous on others. The variance ratio and related metrics cannot reflect this timescale-specificity, yet have remained popular, especially in terrestrial systems. Here, we develop a timescale-specific variance ratio approach that formally decomposes the classical variance ratio according to the timescales of distinct contributions. The approach is implemented in a new R package, called tsvr, that accompanies this paper. We apply our approach to a long-term, multi-site grassland community dataset. Our approach demonstrates that the degree of compensation versus synchrony in community dynamics can vary by timescale. Across sites, population variability was typically greater over longer compared to shorter timescales. At some sites, minimal timescale-specificity in compensatory dynamics translated this pattern of population variability into a similar pattern of greater community variability on longer compared to shorter timescales. But at other sites, differentially stronger compensatory dynamics at longer compared to shorter timescales produced lower-than-expected community variability on longer timescales. Within every site there were plots that exhibited shifts in the strength of compensation between timescales. Our results highlight that compensatory versus synchronous dynamics are intrinsically timescale-dependent concepts, and our timescale-specific variance ratio provides a metric to quantify timescale-specificity and relate it back to the classic variance ratio.",1,321,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/742510v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/742510v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_742510.txt,0,NA,1,NA,these quantities reflect the extent to which either the average or the total across the  254  timescale band of aggregate population variability  255  across the band of community variability  256  are coded into a new r package called tsvr available at www.github.come/reumandc/tsvr  257  (development version) and on the comprehensive r archive network (cran).;     codes which  260  can reproduce the results of this study in their entirety at the click of a button are archived at  261  www.github.com/leiku/varrat_decomp.

Using diffusion MRI, we measured structural connectivity networks in a sample of community dwelling adults (N=124). We used standard graph theoretic measures to characterize the topology of the networks in each individual and correlated individual differences in these topology measures with differences in the Iowa Gambling Task. A principal components regression approach revealed that individual differences in brain network topology associate with differences in optimal decision-making, as well as associate with differences in each participants sensitivity to high frequency rewards.

To maximize transgene packaging in HR-directed gene insertion, we identified minimum optimal homology arm lengths of 300bp for the flanking region of the Cas9-targeting site.

Most of these are diagnosed with Alzheimers disease dementia (ADD) or unspecified dementia. Unrecognized DLB therefore is a critical impediment to clinical studies and treatment trials of both ADD and DLB. There are numerous published studies that suggest that olfactory function tests may be able to differentiate some neurodegenerative conditions from each other and from normal subjects, but there are very few studies with neuropathological confirmation of diagnosis. We compared University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT) results in 209 subjects: 1) 29 concurrently meeting intermediate or high consensus clinicopathological criteria for both DLB and ADD 2) 96 meeting criteria for ADD without DLB 3) 84 control subjects that were non-demented and without parkinsonism at death. The DLB subjects had significantly lower (one-way ANOVA p < 0.0001, pairwise Bonferroni p < 0.05) first and mean UPSIT scores (13.7 and 13.2) than ADD (23.3 and 22.2) or controls (29.6 and 28.9). For subjects with first and mean UPSIT scores less than 20 and 17, respectively, Firth logistic regression analysis, adjusted for age, gender and mean MMSE score, conferred statistically significant odds ratios of 17.5 and 18.0 for predicting a DLB vs ADD diagnosis, as compared to 3.3 for the presence or absence of visual hallucinations throughout the clinical observation period. To our knowledge, this is the largest study to date comparing olfactory function in subjects with neuropathologically confirmed DLB and ADD.

Here, we investigated several mechanisms by which a destabilizing HA mutation, Y17H (activation pH 6.0), may attenuate virus replication and pathogenicity in DBA/2 mice, compared to wild-type (WT; activation pH 5.5). Extracellular lung pH was measured to be near neutral (pH 6.9-7.5). WT and Y17H viruses had similar environmental stability at pH 7.0; thus, extracellular inactivation was unlikely to attenuate Y17H virus. The Y17H virus had accelerated single-step replication kinetics in MDCK, A549, and Raw264.7 cells. The destabilizing mutation also increased early infectivity and type I interferon (IFN) responses in mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DCs). In contrast, the HA-Y17H mutation reduced multistep replication in murine airway mNEC and mTEC cultures and attenuated virus replication, virus spread, severity of infection, and cellular infiltration in the lungs of mice. Normalizing virus infection and weight loss in mice by inoculating them with Y17H virus at a dose 500-fold higher than that of WT virus revealed that the destabilized mutant virus triggered the upregulation of more host genes and increased type I IFN responses and cytokine expression in DBA/2 mouse lungs. Overall, HA destabilization decreased virulence in mice by boosting early infection in DCs, resulting in greater activation of antiviral responses, including type I IFN. These studies reveal HA stability may regulate pathogenicity by modulating IFN responses.\n\nImportanceDiverse influenza A viruses circulate in wild aquatic birds, occasionally infecting farm animals. Rarely, an avian- or swine-origin influenza virus adapts to humans and starts a pandemic. Seasonal and many universal influenza vaccines target the HA surface protein, which is a key component of pandemic influenza. Understanding HA properties needed for replication and pathogenicity in mammals may guide response efforts to control influenza. Some antiviral drugs and broadly reactive influenza vaccines that target the HA protein have suffered resistance due to destabilizing HA mutations that do not compromise replicative fitness in cell culture. Here, we show that despite not compromising fitness in standard cell cultures, a destabilizing H1N1 HA stalk mutation greatly diminishes viral replication and pathogenicity in vivo by modulating type I IFN responses. This encourages targeting the HA stalk with antiviral drugs and vaccines as well as reevaluating previous candidates that were susceptible to destabilizing resistance mutations.",1,472,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/744052v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/744052v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_744052.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

It is thought that evolution has selected for these functions of introns. Here we present evidence for an additional reason why so many metazoan genes have introns, and why some do not. We found that introns control stochasticity in metazoan gene expression. They do this by controlling stochastic autosomal allele bias.

Nevertheless, their fossil record is extremely limited: only Potamidae, Potamonautidae and Trichodactylidae are reported up to the Eocene of the Neotropics so far. This work documents unusually large decapod claws from the Upper Cretaceous (Campanian) continental deposits of Velaux and vicinity (southern France), in close association with large vertebrate remains. In addition to (1) the systematic assignment of these claws, the study addresses (2) the salinity trends in the deposit environment from its faunal assemblage and the elementary chemical patterns of fossils, and (3) the likely scenario for their auto/allochtony in the Velaux fluvial system. These claws belong to a new taxon, Dinocarcinus velauciensis n. gen. n. sp., referred to as Portunoidea sensu lato, a group of “true” crabs nowadays linked to marine systems. However, the faunal assemblage, the claw taphonomy and the carbonates Y/Ho signatures support their ancient freshwater/terrestrial ecology, making them the oldest reported continental brachyurans and extending the presence of crabs in freshwater environments by 40 Ma. Either as primary or as secondary freshwater crabs, the occurrence of these portunoids in Velaux is an evidence for the independent colonizations of continental environments by multiple brachyuran clades over time, as early as the Campanian.View Full Text",1,356,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/747535v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/747535v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_747535.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, social conflict is a potential negative outcome to interaction with a stranger that can be distressing enough to cause an individual to later avoid interactions with other unfamiliar conspecifics. Unfortunately, stress research using a prominent model of social conflict, social defeat stress, has largely omitted female subjects. This has left a void in the literature regarding social strain on female stress biology and adequate comparison of the effect of sex in stress pathways. The prairie vole (Microtus ochrogaster) exhibits aggressive behavior in both sexes, making voles an attractive candidate to model social defeat in both sexes. This study sought to establish a model of social defeat stress in both male and female prairie voles, characterize behavioral changes in response to this stressor, and investigate the role of dopamine signaling in the response to social defeat stress. Defeated male and female prairie voles displayed social avoidance as well as an increase in expression of dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1) in the medial amygdala (MeA). Pharmacological manipulation of DRD1 signaling in the MeA revealed that increased DRD1 signaling is sufficient to induce a social avoidant state, and could be a necessary component in the defeat-induced social avoidance response.

It specifically binds the three identical conserved hydrophobic pockets at the base of the gp41 N-trimer with sub-femtomolar affinity. This extremely high affinity for the transiently exposed gp41 trimer provides a reserve of binding energy (resistance capacitor) to combat resistance via stepwise accumulation of modest affinity-disrupting mutations. Viral passaging in the presence of escalating PIE12-trimer concentrations ultimately selected for PIE12-trimer resistant populations, but required an extremely extended timeframe (>1 year) in comparison to other entry inhibitors. Eventually, HIV developed resistance to PIE12-trimer by mutating Q577 in the gp41 pocket.\n\nResultsUsing deep sequence analysis, we identified three mutations at Q577 (R, N and K) in our two PIE12-trimer resistant pools. Each point mutant is capable of conferring the majority of PIE12-trimer resistance seen in the polyclonal pools. Surface plasmon resonance studies demonstrated substantial affinity loss between PIE12-trimer and the Q577R-mutated gp41 pocket. A high-resolution x-ray crystal structure of PIE12 bound to the Q577R pocket revealed the loss of two hydrogen bonds, the repositioning of neighboring residues, and a small decrease in buried surface area. The Q577 mutations in an NL4-3 backbone decreased viral growth rates. Fitness was ultimately rescued in resistant viral pools by a suite of compensatory mutations in gp120 and gp41, of which we identified seven candidates from our sequencing data.\n\nConclusionsThese data show that PIE12-trimer exhibits a high barrier to resistance, as extended passaging was required to develop resistant virus with normal growth rates. The primary resistance mutation, Q577R/N/K, found in the conserved gp41 pocket, substantially decreases inhibitor affinity but also damages viral fitness. Identified candidate compensatory mutations in gp160 will be the focus of future mechanistic studies.",1,290,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/748111v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/748111v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_748111.txt,1,"field-specific repository, supplement",0,coordinates for the pie12/iqn17q577r complex structure are available at the protein data bank (pdb code: 6psa).     table 2 for crystallographic data,NA

Especially in human gut microbiome studies, where collecting clinical samples can be arduous, the number of taxa considered in any one study often exceeds the number of samples ten to one hundred-fold. This discrepancy decreases the power of studies to identify meaningful differences between samples, increases the likelihood of false positive results, and subsequently limits reproducibility. Despite the vast collections of microbiome data already available, biome-specific patterns of microbial structure are not currently leveraged to inform studies. Instead, most microbiome survey studies focus on differential abundance testing per taxa in pursuit of specific biomarkers for a given phenotype. This methodology assumes differences in individual species, genera, or families can be used to distinguish between microbial communities and ignores community-level response. In this paper, we propose to leverage public microbiome databases to shift the analysis paradigm from a focus on taxonomic counts to a focus on comprehensive properties that more completely characterize microbial community members function and environmental relationships. We learn these properties by applying an embedding algorithm to quantify taxa co-occurrence patterns in over 18,000 samples from the American Gut Project (AGP) microbiome crowdsourcing effort. The resulting set of embeddings transforms human gut microbiome data from thousands of taxa counts to a latent variable landscape of only one hundred \""properties\"", or contextual relationships. We then compare the predictive power of models trained using properties, normalized taxonomic count data, and another commonly used dimensionality reduction method, Principal Component Analysis in categorizing samples from individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and healthy controls. We show that predictive models trained using property data are the most accurate, robust, and generalizable, and that property-based models can be trained on one dataset and deployed on another with positive results. Furthermore, we find that these properties can be interpreted in the context of current knowledge; properties correlate significantly with known metabolic pathways, and distances between taxa in \""property space\"" roughly correlate with their phylogenetic distances. Using these properties, we are able to extract known and new bacterial metabolic pathways associated with inflammatory bowel disease across two completely independent studies.\n\nMore broadly, this paper explores a reframing of the microbiome analysis mindset, from taxonomic counts to comprehensive community-level properties.

Previous research showed that larger L. decemlineata larvae elicit stronger antipredator responses, and mothers perceiving predators improved offspring responses by increasing intraclutch cannibalism -an extreme form of offspring provisioning. We now report substantial additive genetic variation underlying maternal ability to induce intraclutch cannibalism, indicating the potential of this adaptive maternal effect to evolve by natural selection. We also show that paternal size, a heritable trait, impacted larval responses to predation risk, but that larval responses themselves had little additive genetic variation. Together, these results demonstrate how larval responses to predation risk can evolve via two types of parental effects, both of which provide indirect sources of genetic variation for offspring traits.",1,395,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/748251v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/748251v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_748251.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

A subset of PfEMP1 proteins bind to endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), and their expression correlates with development of the symptoms of severe malaria. Structural studies revealed the PfEMP1 to present a helix-kinked-helix motif which forms the core of the EPCR binding site. Using Rosetta-based design we successfully grafted this motif onto a three-helical bundle scaffold. We show that this synthetic binder interacts with EPCR with nanomolar affinity and adopts the expected structure. We also assessed its ability to bind to antibodies found in immunized animals and in humans from malaria endemic regions. Finally, we tested its capacity to effectively elicit antibodies that prevent EPCR binding and analysed the degree of cross-reactivity of these antibodies across a diverse repertoire of EPCR-binding PfEMP1.

Acquisition of the serine (S138) in the common ancestor to modern amniotes created a phosphorylation site for Aurora B. Phosphorylation of S138 disrupts the structure of UBE2D3 and reduces the level of the protein in mouse ES cells (ESCs).

However, there are various sources of error in flight height data (\""height\"" above ground, as opposed to \""altitude\"" above a reference like the sea level): vertical error from the devices themselves, error in the ground elevation below the tracked animals, and error in the horizontal position of the animals and thus the predicted ground elevation below them.\n\nMethodsWe used controlled field trials, simulations, and the reanalysis of raptor case studies with state-space models to illustrate the effect of improper error management.\n\nResultsErrors of a magnitude of 20 meters appear in benign conditions (expected to be larger in more challenging context). These errors distort the shape of the distribution of flight heights, inflate the variance in flight height, bias behavioural state assignments, correlations with environmental covariates, and airspace management recommendations. Improper data filters such as removing all negative recorded flight height records introduce several biases in the remaining dataset, and preclude the opportunity to leverage unambiguous errors to help with model fitting. Analyses that ignore the variance around the mean flight height, e.g., those based on linear models of flight height, and those that ignore the variance inflation caused by telemetry errors, lead to incorrect inferences.\n\nConclusionThe state-space modelling framework, now in widespread use by ecologists and increasingly often automatically implemented within on-board GPS data processing algorithms, makes it possible to fit flight models directly to raw flight height records, with minimal data pre-selection, and to analyse the full distribution of flight heights, not just the mean.

Well-designed training paradigms could be a strong tool for promoting perceptual learning (PL) with rapid and long-lasting improvement in detectability of these subtle mammographic lesions.

However, in this study, we found that the contents of the feedback profoundly and differentially influence the formation and retention of PL to detect calcification and architectural distortion lesions, two types of mammographic lesions that are frequently missed in mammographic screenings. We trained subjects to detect one type of lesion in a mammogram and manipulated the content of the response feedback during training for 3 groups (no feedback, correctness only, and both correctness and location of the lesion). We found that PL occurred for both lesions when both correctness and location feedback were provided. PL also occurred for calcifications but not for distortions when only correctness was provided. No learning occurred without feedback for either lesion. A retest conducted six months later showed that PL was retained only in the group with both correctness and location feedback for both types of lesions.

We show that our approach is superior to previously published methods in several datasets and across different Mycobacterium tuberculosis lineages, as its characteristics allow the comparison of a high number of diverse samples in one analysis - a scenario that becomes more and more likely with the increased usage of whole-genome sequencing in transmission surveillance.\n\nAuthor summaryTuberculosis still is a threat to global health. It is essential to detect and interrupt transmissions to stop the spread of this infectious disease. With the rising use of next-generation sequencing methods, its application in the surveillance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis has become increasingly important in the last years. The main goal of molecular surveillance is the identification of patient-patient transmission and cluster detection. The mutation rate of M. tuberculosis is very low and stable. Therefore, many existing methods for comparative analysis of isolates provide inadequate results since their resolution is too limited. There is a need for a method that takes every detectable difference into account. We developed PANPASCO, a novel approach for comparing pairs of isolates using all genomic information available for each pair. We combine improved SNP-distance calculation with the use of a pan-genome incorporating more than 100 M. tuberculosis reference genomes for read mapping prior to variant detection.

However, the fundamental rules that govern dendritic integration are far from understood. In particular, it is still unclear how cell type-specific differences in dendritic integration arise from general features of neural morphology and membrane properties. Here, retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which relay the visual systems first computations to the brain, represent an exquisite model. They are functionally and morphologically diverse yet defined, and they allow studying dendritic integration in a functionally relevant context. Here, we show how four morphologically distinct types of mouse RGC with shared excitatory synaptic input (transient Off alpha, transient Off mini, sustained Off, and F-miniOff) exhibit distinct dendritic integration rules. Using two-photon imaging of dendritic calcium signals and biophysical modelling, we demonstrate that these RGC types strongly differ in their spatio-temporal dendritic integration: In transient Off alpha cells, dendritic receptive fields displayed little spatial overlap, indicative of a dendritic arbour that is partitioned in largely isolated regions. In contrast, dendritic receptive fields in the other three RGCs overlapped greatly and were offset to the soma, suggesting strong synchronization of dendritic signals likely due to backpropagation of somatic signals. Also temporal correlation of dendritic signals varied extensively among these types, with transient Off mini cells displaying the highest correlation across their dendritic arbour. Modelling suggests that morphology alone cannot explain these differences in dendritic integration, but instead specific combinations of dendritic morphology and ion channel densities are required. Together, our results reveal how neurons exhibit distinct dendritic integration profiles tuned towards their type-specific computations in their circuits, with the interplay between morphology and ion channel complement as a key contributor.",1,807,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/753335v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/753335v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_753335.txt,1,supplement,0,all data scripts and models will become available (see links in table 4,NA

We clarify the principal forces governing the differential manifestation and persistence of the signal of selection by separating the effects of polyploidy on rates of fixation versus rates of diversity (i.e. mutation and recombination) with a set of coalescent simulations. We explore what the major consequences of polyploidy, such as a more localized signal, greater dependence on dominance, and longer persistence of the signal following fixation, mean for within- and across-ploidy inference on the strength and prevalence of selective sweeps.

In territorial species, signals of competitive ability are thought to function primarily during the early stages of territory establishment, but recent evidence suggests that these signals continue to influence interactions with floaters and neighbors well after territory establishment. Here, we examine the influence of the extent of chest spotting displayed by an intruding male on the response of territorial male song sparrows. We exposed males to 3-D printed models with large or small spotting area coupled with conspecific playback and recorded their behavior. We also assessed the response of a subset of males to both the 3-D printed models and a traditional, taxidermic mount to ensure the 3-D models were a realistic stimulus. We found no differences in the number of attacks or proximity to the model due to spotting area. However, territorial males produced more soft songs and tended to sing fewer loud songs, both of which predict attack in our population, in response to the model with less chest spotting. One possibility is that males with less chest spotting elicit a stronger response because they are seen as a greater threat. Based on our previous findings in this system, we think it is more likely that models with less chest spotting are perceived as subordinate and therefore easier to defeat, leading to a stronger response by territory holders. We found males were equally likely to attack 3-D printed models and a taxidermic mount but signaled more aggressively during trials with the taxidermic mount than the 3-D printed models. This suggests that birds recognized the 3-D models as meaningful stimuli but that the use of 3-D printed models should be validated through comparison to a traditional taxidermic mount when possible.",0,326,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/753772v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/753772v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_753772.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here we report that a domain of CHRONO mainly composed of -helixes is critical to repression through the exploitation of protein-protein interactions according to luciferase reporter assays, co-immunoprecipitation, immunofluorescence, genome editing and structural information analysis via circular dichroism spectroscopy. This repression is fulfilled by interactions between CHRONO with a region on the BMAL1 C-terminus where Cryptochrome and CBP bind.

In order to precisely target expression of a gene of interest to particular cell types, intersectional genetic approaches utilizing two promoter/enhancers unique to a cell type are ideal. Within these methodologies, variants that add temporal control of gene expression are the most powerful. We describe the development, validation and application of an intersectional approach that involves three transgenes, requiring the intersection of two promoter/enhancers to target gene expression to precise cell types. Furthermore, the approach utilizes available lines expressing tTA/rTA to control timing of gene expression based on whether doxycycline is absent or present, respectively. We also show that the approach can be extended to other animal models, using chicken embryos.

Studies of cell size homeostasis in single-celled bacteria and yeast have observed several distinct phenomena. Growth can be coupled to division through a range of mechanisms, including a  sizer, wherein cells of varying birth size divide at similar final sizes [1-3], and an  adder, wherein cells increase in size a fixed amount per cell cycle [4-6]. Importantly, intermediate control mechanisms are observed, and even the same organism can exhibit distinct control phenomena depending on growth conditions [2,7,8]. While studying unicellular organisms in laboratory conditions may give insight into their growth control in the wild, this is less apparent for studies of mammalian cells growing outside the organism. Sizer, adder, and intermediate mechanisms have been observed in vitro [9-12], but it is unclear how these diverse size homeostasis phenomena relate to mammalian cell proliferation in vivo. To address this gap, we analyzed time-lapse images of the mouse epidermis taken over one week during normal tissue turnover [13]. We quantified the 3D volume growth and cell cycle progression of single cells within the mouse skin. In dividing epidermal stem cells, we found that cell growth is coupled to division through a sizer mechanism operating largely in the G1 phase. Thus, while the majority of tissue culture studies to-date identified adder mechanisms, our analysis demonstrates that sizer mechanisms are important in vivo and highlights the need to determine their underlying molecular origin.",1,676,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/754424v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/754424v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_754424.txt,0,NA,1,NA,all code used in the study is available at https://github.com/xies/mouse_skin_size_control/.

Yet, the dynamics of the secretion systems activity remains poorly understood, especially when machineries deal with the export of numerous effectors. We address the question of multi-effector secretion by focusing on the Legionella pneumophila Icm/Dot T4SS that translocates a record number of 300 effectors. We set up a kinetic translocation assay, based on the {beta}-lactamase translocation reporter system combined with the effect of the protonophore CCCP. When used for translocation analysis of Icm/Dot substrates constitutively produced by L. pneumophila, this assay allows a fine monitoring of the secretion activity of the T4SS, independently of the expression control of the effectors. We observed that effectors are translocated with a specific timing, suggesting a control of their docking/translocation by the T4SS. Their delivery is accurately organized to allow effective manipulation of the host cell, as exemplified by the sequential translocation of effectors targeting Rab1, namely SidM/DrrA, LidA, LepB. Remarkably, the timed delivery of effectors does not depend only on their interaction with chaperone proteins but implies cyclic-di-GMP signaling, as the diguanylate cyclase Lpl0780/Lpp0809, contributes to the timing of translocation.

Sexes among the wild rock dove and its derived domestic breeds, however, are quite indistinguishable and sex can only be ascertained through genotyping or egg laying and successful hatching of eggs. Yet, the pigeon fancy has discovered sexually dimorphic traits and harnessed some of these traits in some auto-sexing breeds. Early genetics pioneers characterized the sex-linked Stipper locus and showed it to be linked to the pigeon Z linked B-locus (Tyrp1). The alleles of the Stipper locus have variable dominance relative to wild-type (more severe alleles are incompletely dominant, less severe alleles are reportedly fully dominant), characterized by a continuum of lightening in homozygotes and increased variegation in heterozygotes corresponding with severity. We leveraged this positional information and population structure among breeds in a candidate gene approach to identify the genetic mechanism of de novo pigeon sex dichromatism. A large tandem duplication (77 kb) centered on the gene Melanoma antigen recognized by T cells (Mlana) is completely associated with alleles of the Stipper locus.

Genetic variation for this process is therefore important for adaptation. This study investigates the genetic response to temperature fluctuations during SE and its relationship to phenology and height. Canopy height of 315 wheat genotypes (GABI wheat panel) was scanned twice weekly in the field phenotyping platform (FIP) of ETH Zurich using a LIDAR. Temperature response was modelled using linear regressions between SE and mean temperature in each measurement interval. This led to a temperature-responsive (slope) and a temperature-irresponsive (intercept) component.

The temperature response was highly heritable (H2 = 0.81) and positively related to a later start and end of SE as well as final height. Genome-wide association mapping revealed three temperature-responsive and four temperature-irresponsive quantitative trait loci (QTL). Furthermore, putative candidate genes for temperature-response QTL were frequently related to the flowering pathway in A. thaliana, whereas temperature-irresponsive QTLs corresponded with growth and reduced height genes. In combination with Rht and Ppd alleles, these loci, together with the loci for the timing of SE accounted for 71% of the variability in height.

This demonstrates how high-throughput field phenotyping combined with environmental covariates can contribute to a smarter selection of climate-resilient crops.

Mathematical models of biological systems are tools that can be used to investigate causes of cell-to-cell variation. From mathematical analysis and simulation of these models, biological hypotheses can be posed and investigated, then parameter inference can determine which of these is compatible with experimental data. Data from laboratory experiments often consist of \""snapshots\"" representing distributions of cellular properties at different points in time, rather than individual cell trajectories. These data are not straightforward to fit using hierarchical Bayesian methods, which require the number of cell population clusters to be chosen a priori. Here, we introduce a computational sampling method named \""Contour Monte Carlo\"" for estimating mathematical model parameters from snapshot distributions, which is straightforward to implement and does not require cells be assigned to predefined categories. Our method is appropriate for systems where observed variation is mostly due to variability in cellular processes rather than experimental measurement error, which may be the case for many systems due to continued improvements in resolution of laboratory techniques.

Recent studies identified that a single hit of either a de novo or transmitted gene-disrupting, or likely gene-disrupting, mutation in a subset of 65 strongly associated genes can be sufficient to generate an ASD phenotype. We took advantage of consanguineous families with an ASD proband to evaluate this model. By a genome-wide homozygosity mapping of ten families with eleven children displaying ASD, we identified a linkage region of 133 kb in five families at the 3p14.2 locus that includes FEZF2 with a LOD score of 5.8 suggesting a founder effect. Sequencing FEZF2 revealed a common deletion of four codons. However, the damaging FEZF2 mutation did not appear to be sufficient to induce the disease as non-affected parents also carry the mutation and, similarly, Fezf2 knockout mouse embryos electroporated with the mutant human FEZF2 construct did not display any obvious defects in the corticospinal tract, a pathway whose development depends on FEZF2. We extended the genetic analysis of these five FEZF2-linked families versus five FEZF2 non-linked families by studying de novo and transmitted copy number variation (CNV) and performing Whole Exome Sequencing (WES). We identified damaging mutations in the subset of 65 genes strongly associated with ASD whose co-expression analysis suggests an impact on the prefrontal cortex during the mid-fetal periods.

Using phenotypic and genomic data from the UK Biobank, we took advantage of a unique opportunity to screen a wide range of potentially modifiable factors that could offset known risk factors for depression.\n\nMethodsWe curated baseline data on more than 100 lifestyle and environmental factors in participants lives, including behavioral (e.g., exercise, sleep, media use, diet), social (e.g., support, activities), and environmental (e.g., greenspace, pollution) variables. In a follow-up survey, participants reported on their traumatic life experiences and mental health, including depression. Polygenic risk scores for depression were generated based on large-scale genome-wide association results. Excluding those meeting criteria for depression at baseline, we identified at-risk individuals at high predicted probability (> 90th percentile) for clinically significant depression at follow-up based on their (i) polygenic risk, or (ii) reported traumatic life events. Using a factors-wide design corrected for multiple testing and adjusted for potential confounders, we identified modifiable factors associated with follow-up depression in the full sample and among at-risk individuals. Using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) design, we then examined which significant factors showed potential causal influences on depression risk, or vice versa.\n\nResultsA range of baseline modifiable factors were prospectively associated with follow-up depression, including factors related to social engagement, physical activity, media use, and diet. MR follow-up analyses provided further support for the effects of social support-seeking, TV use, and other factors on depression risk.\n\nConclusionAs the field increasingly quantifies the role of genetic factors in complex conditions such as depression, knowledge of modifiable factors that could offset ones genetic risk has become highly relevant. Here, we present an approach to screening for potentially modifiable factors that may offset the risk of depression in general and among at-risk individuals. In light of the burden of disease associated with depression and the urgent need for actionable preventive strategies, this approach could help prioritize candidates for follow-up studies including clinical trials for depression prevention.",0,785,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/759753v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/759753v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_759753.txt,0,NA,1,NA,because prs-cs (available as a python package via https://github.com/getian107/prscs) allows multivariate modeling of local ld patterns and can accommodate a range of underlying genetic architectures while preserving all snps for scoring it demonstrates increased explanatory power compared to conventional and other bayesian methods particularly when using a large discovery gwas23 (for comparison with conventional clumping and thresholding see methods s4).

Do they stand a chance?\n\nThis study aimed to quantitatively characterize audience interactions as an indicator of interest in science news stories authored by early career scientists (henceforth  scientists) trained to function as science reporters, as compared to news items written by reporters and published in the same news outlets.\n\nTo measure users behavior, we collected data on the number of clicks, likes, comments and average time spent on page. The sample was composed of 150 science items written by 50 scientists trained to contribute popular science stories in the Davidson Institute of Science Education reporters program and published on two major Israeli news websites - Mako and Ynet between July 2015 to January 2018. Each science item was paired with another item written by the websites organic reporter, and published on the same channel as the science story (e.g., tourism, health) and the same close time. Overall significant differences were not found in the publics engagement with the different items. Although, on one website there was a significant difference on two out of four engagement types, the second website did not have any difference, e.g., people did not click, like or comment more on items written by organic reporters than on the stories written by scientists.

A popular model posits that inheritance of modified histones, especially in the form of H3-H4 tetramers, underlies inheritance of heterochromatin. Because H3-H4 tetramers are randomly distributed between daughter chromatids during DNA replication, rare occurrences of asymmetric tetramer inheritance within a heterochromatic domain would have the potential to destabilize heterochromatin. This model makes a prediction that shorter heterochromatic domains would experience unbalanced tetramer inheritance more frequently, and thereby be less stable. In contrast to this prediction, we found that shortening a heterochromatic domain in Saccharomyces had no impact on the strength of silencing nor its heritability. Additionally, we found that replisome mutations that disrupt inheritance of H3-H4 tetramers had only minor effects on heterochromatin stability.

The dimer interface overlaps with subsite-1 of the F-box interaction area, explaining why only the Skp1 monomer binds F-box proteins (FBPs).

The three tissue compartments, comprising white matter-, grey matter-, and CSF-like (free water) signals, are potentially useful in the evaluation of brain microstructure in a range of pathologies. However, the reliability and long-term stability of these metrics has not yet been evaluated.\n\nMethodsThis study examined estimates of whole brain microstructure for the three tissue compartments, in three separate test-retest cohorts. Each cohort has different lengths of time between baseline and retest, ranging from within the same scanning session in the shortest interval to three months in the longest interval. Each cohort was also collected with different acquisition parameters.\n\nResultsThe CSF-like compartment displayed the greatest reliability across all cohorts, with intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) values being above 0.95 in each cohort. White matter-like and grey matter-like compartments both demonstrated very high reliability in the immediate cohort (both ICC>0.90), however this declined in the 3 month interval cohort to both compartments having ICC>0.80. Regional CSF-like signal fraction was examined in bilateral hippocampus and had an ICC>0.80 in each cohort.\n\nConclusionThe 3-tissue CSD techniques provide reliable and stable estimates of tissue microstructure composition, up to 3 months longitudinally in a control population. This forms an important basis for further investigations utilizing 3-tissue CSD techniques to track changes in microstructure across a variety of brain pathologies.",1,1061,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/764506v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/764506v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_764506.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Our data suggest that Pol II transcription robustly interferes with Pol III function at specific tRNA genes.

The nodule tissue of the model contains five spatially distinct developmental zones and encompasses the metabolism of both the plant and the bacterium. Flux balance analysis (FBA) suggested that the majority of the metabolic costs associated with symbiotic nitrogen fixation are directly related to supporting nitrogenase activity, while a minority is related to the formation and maintenance of nodule and bacteroid tissue. Interestingly, FBA simulations suggested there was a non-linear relationship between the rate of N2-fixation per gram of nodule and the rate of plant growth; increasing the N2-fixation efficiency was associated with diminishing returns in terms of plant growth. Evaluating the metabolic exchange between the symbiotic partners provided support for: i) differentiating bacteroids having access to sugars (e.g., sucrose) as a major carbon source, ii) ammonium being the major nitrogen export product of N2-fixing bacteria, and iii) N2-fixation being dependent on the transfer of protons from the plant cytoplasm to the bacteria through acidification of the peribacteroid space. Our simulations further suggested that the use of C4-dicarboxylates by N2-fixing bacteroids may be, in part, a consequence of the low concentration of free oxygen in the nodule limiting the activity of the plant mitochondria.

Therefore, the understanding of AR mechanisms, evolution and global distribution is a priority due to its impact on the treatment course and patient survivability. Besides all efforts in the elucidation of AR mechanisms in clinical strains, little is known about its prevalence and evolution in environmental uncultivable microorganisms. In this study, 293 metagenomic from the TARA Oceans project were used to detect and quantify environmental antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) using machine learning tools. After extensive manual curation, we show the global ocean ARG abundance, distribution, taxonomy, phylogeny and their potential to be horizontally transferred by plasmids or viruses and their correlation with environmental and geographical parameters. A total of 99,205 environmental ORFs were identified as potential ARGs. These ORFs belong to 560 ARG families that confer resistance to 26 antibiotic classes. 24,567 ORFs were found in contigs classified as plasmidial sequences, suggesting the importance of mobile genetic elements in the dynamics of ARGs transmission. Moreover, 4,804 contigs with more than 2 ARGs were found, including 2 plasmid-like contigs with 5 different ARGs, highlighting the potential presence of multi-resistant microorganisms in the natural ocean environment. This also raises the possibility of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) between clinical and natural environments. The abundance of ARGs showed different patterns of distribution, with some classes being significantly more abundant in coastal biomes. Finally, we identified ARGs conferring resistance to some of the most relevant clinical antibiotics, revealing the presence of 15 ARGs from the recently discovered MCR-1 family with high abundance on Polar Biomes.

This assembly method allowed for straightforward tuning of bulk scaffold rigidity by varying the tetrazine to norbornene ratio, with increasing tetrazine resulting in increasing scaffold storage modulus, Youngs modulus, and maximum stress. These changes were independent of void fraction.

Mediator has four conserved modules, Head, Middle, Tail, and Kinase, and has been implicated in nearly all aspects of gene regulation. The Tail module has been shown to recruit the Mediator complex to the enhancer or UAS regions of genes via interactions with transcription factors, and the Kinase domain facilitates the transition of Mediator from the UAS/enhancer to the preinitiation complex via protein phosphorylation. Here we analyze expression of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae HO gene using a sin4 Mediator Tail mutation that separates the Tail module from the rest of the complex; the sin4 mutation permits independent recruitment of the Tail module to promoters without the rest of Mediator. Significant increases in recruitment of the SWI/SNF and SAGA coactivators to the HO promoter UAS were observed in a sin4 mutant, along with increased gene activation. These results are consistent with recent studies that have suggested the Kinase module functions negatively to inhibit activation by the Tail. However, we found that Kinase module mutations did not mimic the effect of a sin4 mutation on HO expression. This suggests that at HO the core Mediator complex (Middle and Head modules) must play a role in limiting Tail binding to the promoter UAS and gene activation.

Here we describe a dual color (DC) extension of the fluorescence z-scan technique which has proven successful for quantification of peripheral membrane protein binding to the PM in living cells. We demonstrate that the co-expression of a second distinctly colored fluorescent protein provides a soluble reference species, which delineates the extent of the cell cytoplasm and lowers the detection threshold of z-scan PM binding measurements by an order of magnitude. DC z-scan generates an intensity profile for each detection channel that contains information on the axial distribution of the peripheral membrane and reference protein. Fit models for DC z-scan are developed and verified using simple model systems. Next, we apply the quantitative DC z-scan technique to investigate the binding of two peripheral membrane protein systems for which previous z-scan studies failed to detect binding: human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) matrix (MA) protein and lipidation-deficient mutants of the fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2. Our findings show that these mutations severely disrupt PM association of fibroblast growth factor receptor substrate 2 but do not eliminate it.

Here, we show that the zebrafish olfactory bulbs (OBs) receive direct interhemispheric projections from their contralateral counterparts in addition to top-down inputs from the contralateral zebrafish homolog of olfactory cortex. The direct interhemispheric projections between the OBs reach peripheral layers of the contralateral OB and retain a fine-grained topographic organization, which directly connects similarly tuned olfactory glomeruli across hemispheres. In contrast, interhemispheric top-down inputs consist of diffuse projections that broadly innervate the inhibitory granule cell layer.

We show that the interhemispheric connections in the olfactory system enable the modulation of odor response and improve the detection of a reproductive pheromone, when presented together with competing complex olfactory cues, by boosting the response of the pheromone selective neurons.

However, whether flagella are permanent cell structures and, if not, the circumstances and timing of their production and loss during the bacterial life cycle remain poorly understood. Here we used the single polar flagellum of Vibrio alginolyticus as our model and, using in vivo fluorescence imaging, revealed that the percentage of flagellated bacteria (PFB) in a population varies substantially across different bacterial growth phases. In the early-exponential phase, the PFB increases rapidly in respect to incubation time, mostly through widespread flagella production. In the mid-exponential phase, the PFB peaks at around 76% and the partitioning of flagella between the daughter cells is 1:1 and strictly at the old poles. After entering the stationary phase, the PFB starts to decline, mainly because daughter cells stop making new flagella after cell division. Interestingly, we discovered that bacteria can actively abandon flagella after prolonged stationary culturing, though cell division has long been suspended. Lack of glucose was found to be a major factor promoting flagellar disassembly. We also revealed that the active loss of flagella was initiated by breakage in the rod connecting the extracellular filament to the basal body formed by MS- and C-rings.

Trogocytosis is likely to underlie tissue damage during infection and it represents a potential target for therapeutic intervention, although the mechanism is still unknown. Assays in current use to analyze trogocytosis by amoebae have not been amenable to studying different types of human cells, or to high-throughput analysis. Here, we developed two complementary assays to measure trogocytosis by quantifying human cell viability, both of which can be used for suspension and adherent cells. The first assay uses CellTiterGlo, a luminescent readout for cellular ATP levels, as a proxy for cell viability. We found that the CellTiterGlo signal is proportional to the quantity of viable cells, and can be used to detect death of human cells after co-incubation with amoebae. We established a second assay that is microscopy-based and uses two fluorescent stains to directly differentiate live and dead human cells.

In Drosophila, the mushroom bodies (MBs) are critical for olfactory associative learning and conditioned taste aversion, but how the output of the MBs affects specific behavioral responses is unresolved. In conditioned taste aversion, Drosophila shows a specific behavioral change upon learning: proboscis extension to sugar is reduced after a sugar stimulus is paired with an aversive stimulus. While studies have identified MB output neurons (MBONs) that drive approach or avoidance behavior, whether the same MBONs impact proboscis extension behavior is unknown. Here, we tested the role of MB pathways in modulating proboscis extension and identified 10 MBON split-GAL4 lines that upon activation significantly decreased proboscis extension to sugar. Activating several of these lines also decreased sugar consumption, revealing that these MBONs have a general role in modifying feeding behavior beyond proboscis extension. Although the MBONs that decreased proboscis extension and ingestion are different from those that drive avoidance behavior in another context, the diversity of their arborizations demonstrates that a distributed network influences proboscis extension behavior.

As a result, the electromyographic (EMG) activity associated with digit movement at different wrist postures may also change. Therefore, we sought to quantify the posture-dependence of extrinsic finger muscle activity. Fine-wire bipolar electrodes were inserted in the extrinsic hand muscles of able-bodied subjects to record EMG activity during wrist and finger movements in various postures. EMG activity of all the recorded finger muscles were significantly different (p<.05, ANOVA) when performing the same movement in five different wrist postures. EMG activity varied by up to 70%, with the highest levels of activity observed in finger extensors when the wrist was extended. Similarly, finger flexors were most active when the wrist was flexed. For the finger flexors, EMG variations with wrist posture were most prominent for index finger muscles, while the EMG activity of all finger extensor muscles were similarly modulated. The extrinsic finger muscles also showed significant activity during wrist movements with the digits held still regardless of finger posture, suggesting that they may play a role in generating torque during wrist movements. Finally, we developed a pair of generalized classifiers that show that finger muscle EMG can be used to predict wrist posture.

The earliest stages of development are fueled by maternally provided mRNAs until the zygote can take over transcription of its own genome. In early development, both maternally deposited and zygotically transcribed gene products have been well characterized in model systems. Previously, we demonstrated that across the genus Drosophila, maternal and zygotic mRNAs are largely conserved but also showed a surprising amount of change across species, with more differences evolving at the zygotic stage than the maternal stage. In this study, we use comparative methods to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms underlying maternal deposition and zygotic transcription across species. Through motif analysis, we discovered considerable conservation of regulatory mechanisms associated with maternal transcription, as compared to zygotic transcription. We also found that the regulatory mechanisms active in the two genomes, maternal versus zygotic, are quite different. For maternally deposited genes, we uncovered many signals that are consistent with transcriptional regulation through control at the level of chromatin through factors enriched in the ovary, rather than precisely controlled gene-specific factors. For genes expressed only by the zygotic genome, we found evidence for previously identified regulators such as Zelda and GAGA-factor, with multiple analyses pointing toward gene-specific regulation. The observed mechanisms of regulation are consistent with what is known about regulation in these two genomes: during oogenesis, the maternal genome is optimized to quickly produce a large volume of transcripts to provide to the oocyte; after zygotic genome activation, mechanisms are employed to activate transcription of specific genes in a spatiotemporally precise manner. Thus the genetic architecture of the maternal and zygotic genomes and the specific requirements for the transcripts present at each stage of embryogenesis determine the regulatory mechanisms responsible for transcripts present at these stages.

Author summaryEarly development in animals is a unique period of time, as it is controlled by gene products from two different genomes: that of the mother and that of the zygote. The earliest stages of development are directed by maternal mRNAs and proteins that are deposited into the egg, and only later does the zygote take over the transcription of its own genome. In this paper, we use data from 11 fruit fly species characterizing all the genes transcribed by the mother and later by the zygote, to investigate how transcription is regulated in the maternal and zygotic genomes. While we find some conserved regulatory elements at both stages, regulation of maternal transcription is much more highly conserved across species. We present evidence that maternal transcription is controlled in large co-regulated chromatin domains, while zygotic transcription is much more gene-specific. These results make sense in the context of where these genes are being transcribed, as maternal transcripts are generated in support cells which churn out a large amount of mRNA during oogenesis, while zygotic genes are often transcribed in a particular time and place in the embryo.",1,618,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/769638v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/769638v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_769638.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,508  methods  509  data acquisition  510  rna-seq data utilized for this study was generated previously [24] and is available at ncbi/geo at  511  accession number gse112858.,NA

We modeled planar, human-like walking with pendulum-like legs, and found the most economical control to be quite stereotypical. It starts by gaining momentum several footfalls ahead of an upward step, in anticipation of the momentum lost atop that step, and then ends with another speed-up to regain momentum thereafter. A similar pattern can be scaled to a variety of conditions, including both upward or downward steps, yet allow for considerably reduced overall energy and peak power demands, compared to compensation without anticipation. We define a ""persistence time"" metric from the transient decay response after a disturbance, to describe how momentum is retained between steps, and how far ahead a disturbance should be planned for.

Over the past decade, a renewed interest for rest brain functioning has emerged in the scientific community, reflected on a large number of resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) studies, but results remain heterogeneous. It is possible today to investigate rest brain functioning by measuring rest cerebral blood flow (CBF) with MRI using arterial spin labeling (ASL). Here, we investigated rest CBF abnormalities using non-invasive ASL-MRI in 18 children with ASD without cognitive delay (10.4 {+/-} 2.8 y) and 30 typically developing children (10.6 {+/-} 3.0 y). Following quality control, images from a final sample of 12 children with ASD (11.2 {+/-} 2.9 y) and 28 typically developing children (10.1 {+/-} 2.5 y) were analyzed. Whole brain voxel-by-voxel analysis showed significant rest CBF decrease in temporal regions, mainly in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), in children with ASD. This hypoperfusion was individually detected in 83% of children with ASD. Finally, negative correlation was observed between ASD severity scores and rest CBF in the right posterior STS. Strikingly, despite the small sample studied here, our results are extremely similar to previous PET and SPECT findings describing decreased rest CBF in the same superior temporal regions at group and individual levels, as well as correlation with symptoms severity. The congruence between these results, with different methods and in different ASD profiles, reinforce the strength of rest functional abnormalities within these superior temporal regions in ASD and strongly indicates it might be a core characteristic of the disorder. Identifying a core dysfunctional region in ASD bears direct implications to the development of novel therapeutic interventions, such as transcranial magnetic stimulation. In addition, if confirmed in a larger sample, rest temporal hypoperfusion could become a reliable brain imaging biomarker in ASD.",0,536,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/771584v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/771584v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_771584.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Activation of motor neurons during fictive swimming caused co-activation of efferent fibers and suppression of synaptic transmission from the primary mechanoreceptors, the hair cells. In some hair cells, a single motor spike inhibited glutamate release by about 50% and block was often complete within 50-100 ms of the start of swimming. All hair cells polarized to be activated by posterior deflections, as would occur during forward swimming, were suppressed by >90%, while only half of those polarized in the anterior direction were inhibited and by an average of just 45%.

One of these effector proteins, termed SECRETED ASTER YELLOWS-WITCHES BROOM PROTEIN 54 (SAP54), leads to the degradation of a specific subset of floral homeotic proteins of the MIKC-type MADS-domain family via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. In consequence, the developing flowers show the homeotic transformation of floral organs into vegetative leaf-like structures. The molecular mechanism of SAP54 action involves physical binding to the keratin-like K-domain of MIKC-type proteins, and to some RAD23 proteins, which translocate ubiquitylated substrates to the proteasome. The structural requirements and specificity of SAP54 function are poorly understood, however. Here we report, based on biophysical and molecular biological analyses, that SAP54 folds into -helical structures. We also show that the insertion of helix-breaking mutations disrupts correct folding of SAP54, which interferes with the ability of SAP54 to bind to its target proteins and to cause disease phenotypes in vivo. Surprisingly, dynamic light scattering data together with electrophoretic mobility shift assays suggest that SAP54 preferentially binds to multimeric complexes of MIKC-type proteins rather than to dimers or monomers of these proteins. Together with literature data this finding suggests that MIKC-type proteins and SAP54 constitute multimeric -helical coiled-coils, possibly also involving other partners such as RAD23 proteins.

One understudied but important source of transcriptional regulators are transposable elements (TEs), which are widespread throughout the human genome. Aberrant usage of these sequences could therefore contribute to oncogenic transcriptional circuits. However, the regulatory influence of TEs and their links to disease pathogenesis remain unexplored in AML. Using epigenomic data from AML primary samples and leukemia cell lines, we identified six endogenous retrovirus (ERV) families with AML-associated enhancer chromatin signatures that are enriched in binding of key regulators of hematopoiesis and AML pathogenesis. Using both CRISPR-mediated locus-specific genetic editing and simultaneous epigenetic silencing of multiple ERVs, we demonstrate that ERV deregulation directly alters the expression of adjacent genes in AML. Strikingly, deletion or epigenetic silencing of an ERV-derived enhancer suppressed cell growth by inducing apoptosis in leukemia cell lines. Our work reveals that ERVs are a previously unappreciated source of AML enhancers that have the potential to play key roles in leukemogenesis.

We measured levels and poly(A) tail sizes of serum-induced mRNAs and used mathematical modelling to compare their deadenylation time with the delay in decay and found that they are indeed correlated. Discrepancies between our data and the polyadenylation models at later time points after the peak of induction led us to investigate the size of the poly(A) tails on newly made mRNA. Surprisingly, new serum-induced mRNAs synthesised late in induction had short poly(A) tails (around A25) in the nucleus. In addition, newly made constitutive mRNAs had medium sized poly(A) tails (around A50). To see if deadenylation was responsible for the new short poly(A) tails, we depleted Cnot1, a subunit of the CCR4/NOT deadenylase. Cnot1 depletion led to slower deadenylation of cytoplasmic mRNAs, as expected, but also decreased transcription and led to longer nuclear mRNA poly(A) tails. These observations implicate CCR4/NOT in regulating both the transcription and the nuclear poly(A) tail size of serum-induced mRNAs. Detection of some chromatin-associated mRNAs with long poly(A) tails suggested that nuclear deadenylation is an early event.

A formal justification for such continual evolution ultimately relies on the ""invasion implies substitution""-principle. Here, whenever a mutant allele causing a small phenotypic change can successfully invade a population, the ancestral (or wild-type) allele will be replaced, whereby fostering gradual phenotypic change if the process is repeated. It has been argued that this principle holds in a broad range of situations, including spatially and demographically structured populations experiencing frequency and density dependent selection under demographic and environmental fluctuations. However, prior studies have not been able to account for all aspects of population structure, leaving unsettled the conditions under which the ""invasion implies substitution""-principle really holds. In this paper, we start by laying out a program to explore and clarify the generality of the ""invasion implies substitution""-principle. Particular focus is given on finding an explicit and functionally constant representation of the selection gradient on a quantitative trait. Using geometric singular perturbation methods, we then show that the ""invasion implies substitution""-principle generalizes to well-mixed and scalar-valued polymorphic multispecies ecological communities that are structured into finitely many demographic (or physiological) classes. The selection gradient is shown to be constant over the evolutionary timescale and that it depends only on the resident phenotype, individual growth-rates, population steady states and reproductive values, all of which are calculated from the resident dynamics.

Here, we probe the frequency-dependent intracellular viscoelastic properties of living cells using multifrequency excitation and in situ optical trap calibration. At long timescales in the intracellular environment, we observe that the cytoskeleton becomes fluid-like. The mechanics are well-captured by a model in which actin filaments are dynamically connected by a single dominant crosslinker.

The importance of interactions in the Dobzhansky-Muller model suggests that gene coexpression networks provide a powerful framework to understand disrupted pathways associated with postzygotic isolation. Here, we perform Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) to infer gene interactions in hybrids of two recently diverged European house mouse subspecies, Mus mus domesticus and M. m. musculus, which commonly show hybrid male sterility or subfertility. We use genome-wide testis expression data from 467 hybrid mice from two mapping populations: F2s from a laboratory cross between wild-derived pure subspecies strains and offspring of natural hybrids captured in the Central Europe hybrid zone. This large data set enabled us to build a robust consensus network using hybrid males with fertile phenotypes. We identify several expression modules, or groups of coexpressed genes, that are disrupted in subfertile hybrids, including modules functionally enriched for spermatogenesis, cilium and sperm flagellum organization, chromosome organization and DNA repair, and including genes expressed in spermatogonia, spermatocytes and spermatids. Our network-based approach enabled us to hone in on specific hub genes likely to be influencing module-wide gene expression and hence potentially driving Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities.

The fitness landscapes of genetic sequences are characterized by high dimensionality and \""ruggedness\"" due to sign epistasis. Ascending from low to high fitness on such landscapes can be difficult because adaptive trajectories get stuck at low-fitness local peaks. Compounding matters, recent computational complexity arguments have proposed that extremely long, winding adaptive paths may be required to even reach local peaks, a \""maze-like\"" landscape topography. The extent to which peaks and mazes shape the mode and tempo of evolution is poorly understood due to empirical limitations and the abstractness of many landscape models. We develop a biophysically-grounded computational model of protein evolution based on two novel extensions of the classic hydrophobic-polar lattice model of protein folding. First, rather than just considering fold stability we account for the tradeoff between stability and aggregation propensity. Second, we use a \""hydrophobic zipping\"" algorithm to kinetically generate ensembles of post-translationally folded structures. Our stability-aggregation fitness landscape exhibits extensive sign epistasis and local peaks galore. We confirm the postulated existence of maze-like topography in our biologically-grounded landscape. Although these landscape features frequently obstruct adaptive ascent to high fitness and virtually eliminate reproducibility of evolutionary outcomes, many adaptive paths do successfully complete the long ascent from low to high fitness.

We characterized the prokaryotic (archaea, bacteria) and eukaryotic (fungi, protists) communities in soils from four different countries (Cameroon, France, Italy, Senegal) and determined if a rhizosphere core microbiome existed across these different countries. The wheat genotype had a limited effect on the rhizosphere microbiome (2% of variance) as the majority of the microbial taxa were consistently associated to multiple wheat genotypes grown in the same soil. Large differences in taxa richness and in community structure were observed between the eight soils studied (57% variance) and the two agricultural practices (10% variance). Despite these differences between soils, we observed that 179 taxa (2 archaea, 104 bacteria, 41 fungi, 32 protists) were consistently detected in the rhizosphere, constituting a core microbiome. In addition to being prevalent, these core taxa were highly abundant and collectively represented 50% of the reads in our dataset. Based on these results, we identify a list of key taxa as future targets of culturomics, metagenomics and wheat synthetic microbiomes. Additionally, we show that protists are an integral part of the wheat holobiont that is currently overlooked.

We established that the immune suppressive cytokine interleukin (IL)-27 is elevated in early life. In the present work, we hypothesized that increased levels of IL-27 may predispose the neonatal population to more severe infection during sepsis. In a neonatal sepsis model, systemic IL-27 levels continued to rise during infection. Peripheral tissue analysis revealed systemic IL-27 expression, while myeloid cell profiling identified Gr-1 and F4/80-expressing cells as the most abundant producers of IL-27 during infection. Increased IL-27 levels were consistent with increased mortality that was improved in WSX-1-/- mice that lack a functional IL-27 receptor. Infected WSX-1-/- pups exhibited improved weight gain and reduced morbidity. IL-27 signaling in WT mice promoted increased bacterial burdens and systemic inflammation compared to WSX-1-/- neonates. This was consistent with more efficient bacterial killing by Ly6B.2+ myeloid cells and macrophages from WSX-1-deficient compared to wild-type neonates. Live animal imaging further supported a more severe and disseminated infection in WT neonates. This is the first report to describe the impact of elevated early life IL-27 on the host response in neonates while also defining the cell and tissue sources of cytokine. IL-27 is frequently associated with suppressed inflammation. In contrast, our findings demonstrate that IL-27 promotes inflammation during neonatal sepsis by directly compromising control of bacteria that drive the inflammatory response. Collectively, our results suggest that IL-27 represents a therapeutic target to limit susceptibility and improve infectious outcomes in neonatal sepsis.\n\nIMPORTANCEA number of differences in the neonatal immune response compared with adults have been well described. However, a mechanistic understanding of what needs to be overcome in the neonate to generate a more protective immune response during acute bacterial infection has been limited. The work described here helps fill the gap of what is necessary to overcome in order to achieve improved host response to infection. To further the novelty, IL-27 has not previously been attributed to dysfunction or deficiency in neonatal immunity. Our results enhance the understanding of IL-27 biology in the neonatal population while providing evidence that elevated IL-27 levels limit a protective immune response and are detrimental during neonatal sepsis. Strategies aimed at targeting circulating IL-27 concentrations early in life have the potential to improve control of bacterial infection in neonates.",1,644,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/777839v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/777839v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_777839.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, the functional role of theta activity in controlled behavior remains to be determined. Here, we used a behavioral task (Isabella et al., 2019) that covertly manipulated the ability to inhibit (and switch) motor responses using a repeating pattern of stimuli that reduced reaction times (RT) to probable over unexpected stimuli, without participants awareness of the pattern. We combined this task with concurrent measures of brain activity and pupil diameter (as a measure of cognitive activity) of 16 healthy adults during response preparation and inhibition during changes in stimulus probability. Observed RT provided evidence of pattern learning and pupillometry revealed parametric changes in cognitive activity with stimulus probability. Critically, reliable pupillary effects (Hedges g = 1.38) in the absence of RT differences (g = 0.10) indicated that cognitive activity increased without overt changes in behavior (RT). Such increased cognitive activity was accompanied by parametric increases in frontal theta and sensorimotor gamma. In addition, correlation between pre-stimulus beta and pre-response gamma in the motor cortex and post-stimulus frontal theta activity suggest bidirectional interactions between motor and frontal areas. These interactions likely underlie recruitment of preparatory and inhibitory neural activity during rapid motor control. Furthermore, pupillary and frontal theta effects during learned switches demonstrate that increases in inhibitory control of behavior can occur automatically, without conscious awareness.\n\nSignificance StatementGoal-directed control is crucial for overriding habits and producing desired actions, which can fail during errors and accidents, and may be impaired in addiction, attention-deficit disorders, or dementia. This type of control, including response inhibition, is typically accompanied by frontal theta-band activity. We examined the relationship between frontal theta and response inhibition during unconscious pattern learning. First, we found that frontal activity was sensitive to changes in control and correlated with reaction times. Second, insufficient motor preparation predicted greater frontal activity, reflecting a greater need for control, which in turn predicted greater response-related motor activity. These results link the frontal and motor cortices, providing possible mechanisms for controlled behavior while demonstrating that goal-directed control can proceed automatically and unconsciously.",0,743,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/777961v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/777961v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_777961.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

It is widely believed that cannabis, or its main psychoactive component {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), impairs working memory, i.e., the ability to temporarily hold information in mind. However, our review of the literature yielded surprisingly little empirical support for an effect of THC or cannabis on working memory. We thus conducted a study with 3 main goals: (1) quantify the effect of THC on visual working memory in a well-powered sample (2) test the potential role of cognitive effects (mind wandering and metacognition) in disrupting working memory, and (3) demonstrate how insufficient sample size and task duration reduce the likelihood of detecting a drug effect. We conducted two double-blind, randomized crossover experiments in which healthy adults (N=23, 23) performed a reliable and validated visual working memory task (the ""Discrete Whole-Report task"", 90 trials) after administration of THC (7.5 and/or 15 mg oral) or placebo. We also assessed self-reported  mind wandering (Exp 1) and metacognitive accuracy about ongoing task performance (Exp 2). THC impaired working memory performance (d = .65), increased mind wandering (Exp 1), and decreased metacognitive accuracy about task performance (Exp 2).

While soluble Nrp2-Fc (sNrp2-Fc) interferes with epithelial/endothelial cell entry through UL128, soluble PDGFR-Fc (sPDGFR-Fc) interacts with gO thereby inhibiting infection of all cell types. Since gO is the most variable subunit we investigated the influence of gO polymorphism on the inhibitory capacities of sPDGFR-Fc and sNRP2-Fc.\n\nAccordingly, gO genotype 1c (GT1c) sequence was fully or partially replaced by gO GT2b, GT3, GT5 sequences in TB40-BAC4-luc background. All mutants were tested for fibroblast and epithelial cell infectivity, for virions gO and gH content, and for infection inhibition by sPDGFR-Fc and sNrp2-Fc.\n\nFull-length and partial gO GT swapping may strongly alter the virions gO and gH levels associated with enhanced epithelial cell infectivity. All gO GT mutants except recombinant gO GT1c/3 displayed a near-complete inhibition at 1.25 g/ml sPDGFR-Fc on epithelial cells (98% versus 91%) and all on fibroblasts ([&ge;] 99%). While gO GT replacement did not influence sNrp2-Fc inhibition at 1.25 g/ml on epithelial cells (96%-98%), it rendered mutants with low gO levels moderately accessible to fibroblasts inhibition (20%-40%). In contrast to the steep sPDGFR-Fc inhibition curves (slope >1.0), sNrp2-Fc dose-response curves on epithelial cells displayed slopes of ~1.0 suggesting functional differences between these entry inhibitors.\n\nOur findings suggest that targeting of gO-trimer rather than UL128-pentamer might be a promising target to inhibit infectivity independent of the cell type, gO polymorphism, and gO/gH content. However, intragenic gO recombination may lead to moderate resistence to sPDGFR-Fc inhibition.\n\nImportanceHuman cytomegalovirus (HCMV) is known for its broad cell tropism as reflected by the different organs and tissues affected by HCMV infection. Hence, inhibition of HCMV entry into distinct cell types could be considered as a promising therapeutic option to limit cell-free HCMV infection. Soluble forms of cellular entry receptor PDGFR rather than those of entry receptor neuropilin-2 inhibit infection of multiple cell types. sPDGFR specifically interacts with gO of the trimeric gH/gL/gO envelope glycoprotein complex. HCMV strains may differ with respect to the virions amount of trimer and the highly polymorphic gO sequence. In this study, we show that gO polymorphism rather than gO levels may affect the inhibitory capacity of sPDGFR. The finding that gO intragenic recombination may lead to moderate evasion from sPDGFR inhibition is of major value to the development of potential anti-HCMV therapeutic compounds based on sPDGFR.",1,858,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/778241v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/778241v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_778241.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

For stimuli to be discriminated reliably, differences in population responses must be accurately decoded by downstream networks. Several methods to compare the pattern of responses and their differences have been used by neurophysiologist to characterize the accuracy of the sensory responses studied. Among the most widely used analysis, we note methods based on Euclidian distances or on spike metric distance such as the one proposed by van Rossum. Methods based on artificial neural network and machine learning (such as self-organizing maps) have also gain popularity to recognize and/or classify specific input patterns. In this brief report, we first compare these three strategies using dataset from 3 different sensory systems. We show that the input-weighting procedure inherent to artificial neural network allows the extraction of the information most relevant to the discrimination task and thus the method performs particularly well. To combine the ease of use and rapidity of methods such as spike metric distances and the advantage of weighting the inputs, we propose a measure based on geometric distances were each dimension is weighted proportionally to how informative it is. In each dimension, the overlap between the distributions of responses to the two stimuli is quantified using the Kullback-Leibler divergence measure. We show that the result of this Kullback-Leibler-weighted spike train distance (KLW distance) analysis performs as well or better than the artificial neural network we tested and outperforms the more traditional spike distance metrics. We applied information theoretic analysis to Leaky-Integrate-and-Fire model neuron responses and compare their encoding accuracy with the discrimination accuracy quantified through these distance metrics to show the high degree of correlation between the results of the two approaches for quantifying coding performance.

Genome-wide transcriptomic studies in bulk brain tissue have identified several molecular signatures associated with the disease. While these studies have the potential to shed light into the pathogenesis of PD, they are also limited by two major confounders: RNA post mortem degradation and heterogeneous cell type composition of bulk tissue samples. We performed RNA sequencing following ribosomal RNA depletion in the prefrontal cortex of 49 individuals from two independent case-control cohorts. Using cell-type specific markers, we estimated the cell-type composition for each sample and included this in our analysis models to compensate for the variation in cell-type proportions.\n\nResultsRibosomal RNA depletion results in substantially more even transcript coverage, compared to poly(A) capture, in post mortem tissue. Moreover, we show that cell-type composition is a major confounder of differential gene expression analysis in the PD brain. Correcting for cell-type proportions attenuates numerous transcriptomic signatures that have been previously associated with PD, including vesicle trafficking, synaptic transmission, immune and mitochondrial function. Conversely, pathways related to endoplasmic reticulum, lipid oxidation and unfolded protein response are strengthened and surface as the top differential gene expression signatures in the PD prefrontal cortex.\n\nConclusionsDifferential gene expression signatures in PD bulk brain tissue are significantly confounded by underlying differences in cell-type composition.

We present here the crystal structure of the thrombospondin module 1 (TSP1) domain of CCN3 (previously known as Nov), which shares a similar three-stranded fold with the thrombospondin type 1 repeats of thrombospondin-1 and Spondin-1, but with variations in the disulfide connectivity. Moreover, the CCN3 TSP1 lacks the typical pi-stacked ladder of charged and aromatic residues on one side of the domain, as seen in other TSP1 domains. Using conservation analysis among orthologous domains, we show that a charged cluster in the centre of the domain is the most conserved site and predict it to be a potential functional epitope for heparan sulphate binding. This variant TSP1 domain has also been used to revise the sequence determinants of TSP1 domains and derive improved Pfam sequence profiles for identification of novel TSP1 domains in more than 10,000 proteins across diverse phyla.\n\nSynopsisThe first structure of a thrombospondin module 1 domain (TSP1) from a CCN family matricellular protein has been determined by X-ray crystallography.

Evidence for how it occurred should be preserved in eukaryotic genomes. Based on phylogenetic trees from ribosomal RNA and ribosomal proteins, eukaryotes are typically depicted as branching together with or within archaea. This ribosomal affiliation is widely interpreted as evidence for an archaeal origin of eukaryotes. However, the extent to which the archaeal ancestry of genes for the cytosolic ribosomes of eukaryotic cells is representative for the rest of the eukaryotic genome is unknown. Here we have clustered 19,050,992 protein sequences from 5,443 bacteria and 212 archaea with 3,420,731 protein sequences from 150 eukaryotes spanning six eukaryotic supergroups to identify genes that link eukaryotes exclusively to bacteria and archaea respectively. By downsampling the bacterial sample we obtain estimates for the bacterial and archaeal proportions of genes among 150 eukaryotic genomes. Eukaryotic genomes possess a bacterial majority of genes. On average, eukaryotic genes are 56% bacterial in origin. The majority drops to 53% in eukaryotes that never possessed plastids, and increases to 61% in photosynthetic eukaryotic lineages, where the cyanobacterial ancestor of plastids contributed additional genes to the eukaryotic genome, reaching 67% in higher plants. Intracellular parasites, which undergo reductive evolution in adaptation to the nutrient rich environment of the cells that they infect, relinquish bacterial genes for metabolic processes. In the current sample, this process of adaptive gene loss is most pronounced in the human parasite Encephalitozoon intestinalis with 86% archaeal and 14% bacterial derived genes. The most bacterial eukaryote genome sampled is rice, with 67% bacterial and 33% archaeal genes.

We demand that digital organisms equipped with neural networks solve a computational task reliably over an extended lifespan. Neural connections are costly (as an associated metabolism in living beings). They also degrade over time, but can be regenerated at some expense. We investigate the simultaneous minimization of both these costs and the computational error. Pareto optimal tradeoffs emerge with designs displaying a broad range of solutions: from small networks with high regeneration rate, to large, redundant circuits that regenerate slowly. The organisms lifespan and the external damage act as evolutionary pressures. They improve the exploration of the space of solutions and impose tighter optimality constraints.

However, in higher visual cortex it is rarely verified how well tuning to parameters of simplified experimental stimuli represents tuning to those parameters in complex or naturalistic stimuli. To evaluate precisely how much tuning curves can change with context, we developed a methodology to estimate tuning from neural responses to natural scenes. For neurons in macaque V4, we then estimated tuning curves for hue from both natural scene responses and responses to artificial stimuli of varying hue. We found that neurons hue tuning on artificial stimuli was not representative of their hue tuning on natural images, even if the neurons were strongly modulated by hue. These neurons thus respond strongly to interactions between hue and other visual features. We argue that such feature interactions are generally to be expected if the cortex takes an optimal coding strategy.

In the last 18 years, several enzymes responsible for ecdysteroid biosynthesis, encoded by Halloween genes, have been identified and well characterized, both genetically and biochemically. However, none of these proteins have yet been characterized at the tertiary structure level. Here, we report an integrated in silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses of the Halloween glutathione S-transferase (GST) protein, Noppera-bo (Nobo). We determine crystal structures of Drosophila melanogaster Nobo (DmNobo) complexed with glutathione and 17{beta}-estradiol, a DmNobo inhibitor. 17{beta}-estradiol almost fully occupied the putative ligand-binding pocket, and a prominent hydrogen bond formed between Asp113 of DmNobo and 17{beta}-estradiol. Asp113 is essential for inhibiting DmNobo enzymatic activity by 17{beta}-estradiol, as 17{beta}-estradiol does not inhibit and physically interacts less with the Asp113Ala DmNobo point mutant. Asp113 is highly conserved among Nobo proteins, but not among other GSTs, implying that Asp113 is important for endogenous Nobo function. Indeed, a homozygous nobo allele possessing the Asp113Ala point mutation exhibits embryonic lethality with undifferentiated cuticle structure, a phenocopy of complete loss-of-function nobo homozygotes. These results suggest that the nobo family of GST proteins has acquired a unique amino acid residue, which seems to be essential for binding an endogenous sterol substrate to regulate ecdysteroid biosynthesis.

This study also provides basic insight into applied entomology for developing a new type of insecticides that specifically inhibit ecdysteroid biosynthesis.\n\nSignificance StatementInsect molting and metamorphosis are drastic and dynamic biological processes and, therefore, have fascinated many scientists. Ecdysteroids represent one class of insect hormones that are indispensable for inducing molting and metamorphosis. It is well known that proteins responsible for catalyzing ecdysteroid biosynthesis reactions are encoded by \""Halloween\"" genes, most of which have names of ghosts and phantoms. However, no studies have focused on the structural properties of these biosynthetic proteins.

The basidiomycete Schizophyllum commune has the highest level of genetic polymorphism known among eukaryotes.

Identifying novel therapeutic avenues for prolonging photoreceptor health and function has the potential to improve vision and quality of life for patients suffering from degenerative retinal disorders. Photoreceptors are metabolically unique among other neurons in that they process the majority of their glucose via aerobic glycolysis. One of the main regulators of aerobic glycolysis is hexokinase 2 (HK2). Beyond its enzymatic function of phosphorylating glucose to glucose-6-phosphate, HK2 has additional non-enzymatic roles, including the regulation of apoptotic signaling via AKT signaling. Determining the role of HK2 in photoreceptor homeostasis may identify novel signaling pathways that can be targeted with neuroprotective agents to boost photoreceptor survival during metabolic stress. Here we show that following experimental retinal detachment, p-AKT is upregulated and HK2 translocates to mitochondria. Inhibition of AKT phosphorylation in 661W photoreceptor-like cells results in translocation of mitochondrial HK2 to the cytoplasm, increased caspase activity, and decreased cell viability. Rod-photoreceptors lacking HK2 upregulate HK1 and appear to develop normally. Interestingly, we found that HK2-deficient photoreceptors are more susceptible to acute nutrient deprivation in the experimental retinal detachment model. Additionally, HK2 appears to be important for preserving photoreceptors during aging.

These results suggest that HK2 expression is critical for preserving photoreceptors during acute nutrient stress and aging.

The appearance of NMR resonances undergoing chemical exchange depends on the frequency difference relative to the rate of exchange, and in the case of one-dimensional experiments chemical exchange regimes are well established and well known. However, two-dimensional experiments present additional complexity, as at least one additional frequency difference must be considered. Here we provide a systematic classification of chemical exchange regimes in two-dimensional NMR spectra. We highlight important differences between exchange in HSQC and HMQC experiments, that on a practical level result in more severe exchange broadening in HMQC spectra, but show that complementary alternatives to the HMQC are available in the form of HZQC and HDQC experiments. We present the longitudinal relaxation optimised SOFAST-H(Z/D)QC experiment for the simultaneous acquisition of sensitivity-enhanced HZQC and HDQC spectra, and the longitudinal and transverse relaxation optimised BEST-ZQ-TROSY for analysis of large molecular weight systems. We describe the application of these experiments to the characterisation of the interaction between the Hsp90 N-terminal domain and a small molecule ligand, and show that the independent analysis of HSQC, HMQC, HZQC and HDQC experiments provides improved confidence in the fitted dissociation constant and dissociation rate.

The genus Aquilegia (columbine) is a model system to identify genetic and epigenetic signatures underpinning the rapid adaptive radiation. In this study, we surveyed the genomes and DNA methylomes of ten worldwide Aquilegia species to investigate whether specific genomic architectures were associated with rapid species diversification in the Asian, European and North American lineages. The resulting phylogenies and population structure inferences revealed clearly high genetic and DNA methylomic divergence among the three lineages. Genome-wide scanning demonstrated significantly higher positive and purifying selection pressures among the Asian species compared to the European and North American lineages. More importantly, candidate genes identified at the genetic and epigenetic levels are functionally related to diverse adaptation-related traits, such as stress tolerance, photosynthesis and cell reproduction. While a considerable proportion of the candidate genes share hotspots of intra- and inter-lineage divergence, genetic and epigenetic factors were found to act on complementary biological pathways. By assessing the interaction between genetic variations and epigenetic variability, we found that epigenetic variability is a partially independent factor that intertwines with genetic mechanism to facilitate the diversification of the Aquilegia species. Taken together, these findings suggest that specific genetic architectures have been involved in vital biological pathways in response to diverse environmental conditions and epigenetic modifications may play a complementary role in the process of adaptive speciation. Our study provides an exploratory overview of how the established genetic and epigenetic signatures are associated with the rapid species diversification of Aquilegia species.

Author SummaryDisentangling the genetic and epigenetic bases underpinning species diversification is crucial to understanding the evolution and persistence of biodiversity. The columbine (genus Aquilegia) is a model system to address biological mechanisms associated with rapid adaptive radiation. We surveyed the genomes and DNA methylomes of ten worldwide columbine species to investigate whether specific genetic and epigenetic architectures were involved in the diversification of Asian, European and North American columbine species. We pinpointed candidate genes featuring rapid adaptive radiation identified at either the genetic or the epigenetic levels. These candidate genes are functionally associated with diverse adaptation-related traits such as cell reproduction, plant growth, and stress tolerance. Such genetic and epigenetic signatures have potential contributed adaptabilities to the columbine species to cope with diverse environmental conditions. In addition, we also showed that epigenetic modifications could act as a complementary factor that intertwined with genetic mechanism to facilitate the diversification of the columbine species. In all, our study provides a genome-wide view of how the genetic and epigenetic factors are associated with the rapid species diversification of the columbine species.",0,146,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/782821v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/782821v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_782821.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,all data  356  generated from the study were submitted to ebi under the accession number prjeb34182.,NA

Success in generating long read lengths and genome assemblies of plants has been reported using diverse DNA isolation methods, some of which were tailored to the target species and/or required extensive labor. To avoid the need to optimize DNA isolation for each species, we developed a taxa-independent DNA isolation method that is relatively simple and efficient.

One key process at play during development is the regulation of cell division orientation. In this work, through a reformulation of cell division in terms of its energetic cost, we propose that oriented cell division is one mechanism by which cells can read and react to mechanical forces propagating in a tissue even in the absence of interphase cellular elongation in the direction of these forces. This view reproduces standard geometric division long-axis rules as a special case of a more general behaviour, in which systematic deviations from these rules can emerge. We show that states of anisotropic tension in multicellular systems can be the cause of these deviations, as often experimentally found in living tissues. Our results provide a unifying view on the different intracellular mechanisms at play in orienting cell division: they are processes which minimize energy loss, reflecting a trade-off between local and long-range mechanical signals. The consequences of this competition are explored in simulated tissues and confirmed in vivo during both the development of the pupal epithelium of dorsal thorax in D. melanogaster and the epidermal morphogenesis of ascidian embryos.

Author summaryIn this work we reformulate the process of cell division orientation in development as a mechanical-energy optimization. We show that classical rules for division orientation naturally emerge when a cell minimizes the work performed against its local environment. Moreover, when multicellular stress profiles are taken into account, observed systematic violations of these rules are explained in correlation with states of anisotropic tension within the tissue. We confirm our findings experimentally on developing systems imaged with cellular resolution. Our results provide a new paradigm to understand cell division in multicellular contexts and contribute to building a physical view of biological phenomena.",0,150,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/785337v3?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/785337v3.full.pdf,_10.1101_785337.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Recent characterization of the mating type distribution revealed the frequency of the MAT idiomorphs are in equilibrium at various spatial scales, indicative of regular sexual recombination. However, the occurrence of the sexual stage of V. effusa has never been observed, and the pathogen was previously believed to rely entirely on asexual reproduction. To explore the existence of a sexual cycle, we paired opposite mating types on oatmeal culture media. In initial experiments, cultures were incubated at 24 C for 2 mo for hyphal interactions to occur between mating types and then maintained at 4 C for 4 mo. Immature pseudothecia were initially observed but following exposure to a 12 h photoperiod for 2 weeks at 24 C, asci and ascospores developed. Further experiments explored the effect of time on pseudothecial development with 4 mo at 4 C as the optimal requirement. The results of this study demonstrate the heterothallic nature of V. effusa. Following experiments investigated progeny from a sexual cross of an albino and a wild-type isolate. Evaluation of isolate pigmentation, mating type, and multilocus genotyping of single ascospore progeny provided evidence that recombination occurred within the sexual crosses.

Interestingly, the non-dependent mice expressing an inhibitory DREADD in the VHC showed a significant increase in ethanol drinking ([~]30%) after hM4Di DREADD activation with clozapine-n-oxide (CNO; 3 mg/kg, ip.) compared to vehicle.

In a separate group of dependent and non-dependent mice, GCaMP6f calcium-dependent activity was recorded in the vHC while mice were actively drinking ethanol. These data showed that once mice were rendered ethanol dependent and were drinking more ethanol than the non-dependent mice, calcium signaling in the ventral hippocampus decreased ([~]45%) in the ethanol dependent mice compared to the non-dependent mice.

Generally, odor map formation and odor processing in all vertebrates is based on the assumption that receptor neuron axons exclusively connect to a single glomerulus without any axonal branching. We comparatively tested this hypothesis in multiple fish and amphibian species by applying sparse cell electroporation to trace single olfactory receptor neuron axons. Sea lamprey (jawless fish) and zebrafish (bony fish) support the unbranched axon concept, with 94% of axons terminating in single glomeruli. Contrastingly, axonal projections of the axolotl (salamander) branch extensively before entering up to six distinct glomeruli. Receptor neuron axons labeled in frog species (Pipidae, Bufonidae, Hylidae and Dendrobatidae) predominantly bifurcate before entering a glomerulus and 59% and 50% connect to multiple glomeruli in larval and post-metamorphotic animals, respectively. Independent of developmental stage, lifestyle and adaptations to specific habitats, it seems to be a common feature of amphibian olfactory receptor neuron axons to frequently bifurcate and connect to multiple glomeruli. Our study challenges the unbranched axon concept as a universal vertebrate feature and it is conceivable that also later diverging vertebrates deviate from it. We propose that this unusual wiring logic evolved around the divergence of the terrestrial tetrapod lineage from its aquatic ancestors and could be the basis of an alternative way of odor processing.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=189 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/788133v1_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (39K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@ca2137org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@4aa870org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@17866c1org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a20ec9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",1,913,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/788133v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/788133v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_788133.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

CRISPR-Cas12a programmed with a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) is used to detect ASFV target DNA. Upon ASFV DNA binding, the Cas12a/crRNA/ASFV DNA complex becomes activated and degrades a fluorescent single stranded DNA (ssDNA) reporter present in the assay. We combine this powerful CRISPR-Cas assay with fluorescence-based point-of-care (POC) system we developed for rapid and accurate virus detection. Without nucleic acid amplification, a detection limit of 1 pM is achieved within 2 hrs. In addition, the ternary Cas12a/crRNA/ASFV DNA complex is highly stable at physiological temperature and continues to cleave the ssDNA reporter even after 24 hrs of incubation, resulting in an improvement of the detection limit to 100 fM.

The spinal cord has a limited ability to regenerate and current clinical therapies for SCI are not effective in helping promote neurologic recovery. We have developed a novel scaffold biomaterial that is fabricated from the biodegradable hydrogel oligo[poly(ethylene glycol)fumarate] (OPF). We have previously shown that positively charged OPF scaffolds (OPF+) in an open spaced, multichannel design can be loaded with Schwann cells to support axonal generation and functional recovery following SCI. We have now developed a hybrid OPF+ biomaterial that increases the surface area available for cell attachment and that contains an aligned microarchitecture and extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins to better support axonal regeneration. OPF+ was fabricated as 0.08 mm thick sheets containing 100 m high polymer ridges that self-assembles into a spiral shape when hydrated. Laminin, fibronectin, or collagen I coating promoted neuron attachment and axonal outgrowth on the scaffold surface. In addition, the ridges aligned axons in a longitudinal bipolar orientation. Decreasing the space between the ridges increased the number of cells and neurites aligned in the direction of the ridge. Schwann cells seeded on laminin coated OPF+ sheets aligned along the ridges over a 6-day period and could myelinate dorsal root ganglion neurons over 4 weeks. The OPF+ sheets support axonal regeneration when implanted into the transected spinal cord. This novel scaffold design, with closer spaced ridges and Schwann cells is a novel biomaterial construct to promote regeneration after SCI.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=133 SRC=\""FIGDIR/small/788539v1_ufig1.gif\"" ALT=\""Figure 1\"">\nView larger version (42K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1ea0ae3org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@70e1f7org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1034b77org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14f784d_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",1,932,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/788539v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/788539v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_788539.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In addition, we examined the effect of  nudging - i.e., whether altering task difficulty could influence self-selected strategies, and hence facilitate learning. Participants wore four inertial measurement units (IMUs) on their upper body and the goal was to use motions of the upper body to move a screen cursor to different targets presented on the screen. The structure in this task that had to be learned was based on the fact that the signals from the IMUs were linearly mapped to the x- and y-position of the cursor. Participants (N = 62) were split into 3 groups (random, self-selected, nudge) based on whether they had control over the sequence in which they could practice the targets. To test whether participants learned the underlying structure, participants were tested both on the trained targets, as well as novel targets that were not practiced during training. Results showed that during training, the self-selected group showed shorter movement times relative to the random group, and both self-selected and nudge groups adopted a strategy of tending to repeat targets. However, in the test phase, we found no significant differences in task performance between groups, indicating that structural learning was not reliably affected by the type of practice. In addition, nudging participants by adjusting task difficulty did not show any significant benefits to overall learning.

The experiments were carried out to identify their contribution for enhancing onion and water productivity in water-stressed irrigation schemes of Korir and Hatset sites. Six factorial treatments comprising of three levels of irrigation methods (furrow, basin and flood) and two levels of irrigation scheduling (fixed interval and farmers practices) were evaluated with three replications. The agronomic and irrigation parameters were subjected to separate level-wise comparison followed by the factorial interaction effects. The results showed that the fixed irrigation interval, basin irrigation method and their factorial combinations showed better performances and produced a higher yield and water productivity. On average, 263.85 q/ha and 281 q/ha of onion were obtained under the basin irrigation method and basin irrigation with fixed irrigation interval (T2) at both sites and seasons. For the T2, 6.27 and 6.06 kg/m3 of water productivity (WP) and 4.39 and 4.24 kg/m3 of irrigation water productivity (IWP) were obtained at Korir and Hatset sites, respectively showing higher results as compared to other treatment combinations. Moreover, the basin irrigation method produces higher marketable onion bulbs that are essential for onion producers to earn maximum profit from selling and enhance their livelihoods. Treatments comprising basin method and fixed interval showed better onion and water productivity in the water-limited irrigation schemes of Tigray.

Despite the widely appreciated disease relevance of mitochondrial dysfunction and loss, the molecular mechanisms underlying mitochondrial fragmentation and metabolic stress in glaucoma are poorly understood. We demonstrate here that glaucomatous retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) show loss of A-kinase anchoring protein 1 (AKAP1), activation of calcineurin (CaN) and reduction of dynamin-related protein 1 (Drp1) phosphorylation at serine 637 (Ser637). These findings suggest that AKAP1-mediated phosphorylation of Drp1 at Ser637 has a critical role in RGC survival in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Male mice lacking AKAP1 show increases of CaN and total Drp1 level, as well as a decrease of Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser637 in the retina. Ultrastructural analysis of mitochondria shows that loss of AKAP1 triggers mitochondrial fragmentation and loss, as well as mitophagosome formation in RGCs. Loss of AKAP1 deregulates oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) complexes (Cxs) by increasing CxII and decreasing CxIII-V, leading to metabolic and oxidative stress. Also, loss of AKAP1 decreases Akt phosphorylation at Serine 473 (Ser473) and threonine 308 (Thr308) and activates the Bim/Bax signaling pathway in the retina. These results suggest that loss of AKAP1 has a critical role in RGC dysfunction by decreasing Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser637, deregulating OXPHOS, decreasing Akt phosphorylation at Ser473 and Thr308, and activating the Bim/Bax pathway in glaucomatous neurodegeneration. Thus, we propose that overexpression of AKAP1 or modulation of Drp1 phosphorylation at Ser637 are potential therapeutic strategies for neuroprotective intervention in glaucoma and other mitochondria-related optic neuropathies.",1,376,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/790139v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/790139v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_790139.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

In particular, the KMT2A/DOT1L target HOXA9, which is commonly de-repressed as a consequence of PRC2 loss or inhibition in other contexts, was not re-activated upon dual DOT1L/EZH2 knockout or inhibition. Despite encouraging data in murine KMT2A-MLLT3 transformed cells suggesting synergy between DOT1L and EZH2 inhibition, we found both synergistic and antagonistic effects on a panel of human KMT2A rearranged cell lines. Combinatorial inhibition of DOT1L and EZH2 is thus not a promising strategy.

Here, we explore the anatomical and functional aspects of zinc in the circadian system. Melanopsin-containing retinal ganglion cells in the mouse retina were found to colocalize ZnT3, indicating that they can release zinc at their synaptic targets. While the master circadian clock in the hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) was found to contain, at best, sparse zincergic input, the intergeniculate leaflet (IGL) was found to have prominent zincergic input. Levels of zinc in these areas were not affected by time of day. Additionally, IGL zinc staining persisted following enucleation, indicating other prominent sources of zinc instead of, or in addition to, the retina. Neither enhancement nor chelation of free zinc at either the SCN or IGL altered circadian responses to phase-shifting light in hamsters. Finally, entrainment, free-running, and circadian responses to light were explored in mice lacking the ZnT3 gene.

While the evolutionary dynamics of influenza viruses play out globally, they are fundamentally driven by mutation, reassortment, drift, and selection within individual hosts. These processes have recently been described for influenza A virus, but little is known about the evolutionary dynamics of influenza B virus (IBV) at the level of individual infections and transmission events. Here we define the within-host evolutionary dynamics of influenza B virus by sequencing virus populations from naturally-infected individuals enrolled in a prospective, community-based cohort over 8176 person-seasons of observation. Through analysis of high depth-of-coverage sequencing data from samples from 91 individuals with influenza B, we find that influenza B virus accumulates lower genetic diversity than previously observed for influenza A virus during acute infections. Consistent with studies of influenza A viruses, the within-host evolution of influenza B viruses is characterized by purifying selection and the general absence of widespread positive selection of within-host variants. Analysis of shared genetic diversity across 15 sequence-validated transmission pairs suggests that IBV experiences a tight transmission bottleneck similar to that of influenza A virus. These patterns of local-scale evolution are consistent with influenza B virus slower global evolutionary rate.\n\nImportanceThe evolution of influenza virus is a significant public health problem and necessitates the annual evaluation of influenza vaccine formulation to keep pace with viral escape from herd immunity. Influenza B virus is a serious health concern for children, in particular, yet remains understudied compared to influenza A virus. Influenza B virus evolves more slowly than influenza A, but the factors underlying this are not completely understood. We studied how the within-host diversity of influenza B virus relates to its global evolution by sequencing viruses from a community-based cohort.

Animal models involving traditional cannabinoid self-administration approaches have been notoriously difficult to establish and differences in the drug employed and its route of administration have limited the translational value of preclinical studies. To address this challenge in the field, we have developed a novel method of cannabis self-administration using response-contingent delivery of vaporized {Delta}9-tetrahydrocannabinol-rich (CANTHC) or cannabidiol-rich (CANCBD) complete cannabis extracts. Male Sprague Dawley rats were trained to nosepoke for discrete puffs of CANTHC, CANCBD, or vehicle (VEH) in daily one-hour sessions. Cannabis vapor reinforcement resulted in strong discrimination between active and inactive operanda. CANTHC maintained higher response rates under fixed ratio schedules and higher break points under progressive ratio schedules compared to CANCBD or VEH, and the number of vapor deliveries positively correlated with plasma THC concentrations. Moreover, metabolic phenotyping studies revealed alterations in locomotor activity, energy expenditure, and daily food intake that are consistent with effects in human cannabis users.

In social insects, for example, the transmission and processing of information is influenced by a well-organized division of labour.

Although herbicides are an effective way to control weeds, more sustainable solutions for weed management are desirable. It has been proposed that crop plants can communally suppress weeds by shading them out. Shade avoidance responses, such as upward leaf movement (hyponasty) and stem or petiole elongation, enhance light capture of individual plants, increasing their individual fitness. The shading capacity of the entire crop community might, however, be more effective if aspects of shade avoidance are suppressed. Testing this hypothesis in crops is hampered by the lack of well-characterized mutants. We therefore investigated if Arabidopsis competitive performance at the community level against invading competitors is affected by the ability to display shade avoidance. We tested two mutants: pif4pif5 that has mildly reduced petiole elongation and hyponasty and pif7 with normal elongation but absent hyponasty in response to shade. Although pif4pif5 performed similar to wildtype, we found that pif7 showed significantly increased canopy biomass and suppression of invading competitors as compared to its wildtype. Our data thus show that modifying specific shade avoidance aspects has potential for plant community performance. This may help to suppress weeds in crop stands.\n\nHighlightHyponastic response in canopies facilitates light penetration and weed growth.

Diagnosing AD is challenging, especially in the early stages. Many patients still go undiagnosed, partly due to the complex heterogeneity in disease progression. This highlights a need for early prediction of the disease course to assist its treatment and tailor therapy options to the disease progression rate. Recent developments in machine learning techniques provide the potential to not only predict disease progression and trajectory of AD but also to classify the disease into different etiological subtypes.

Methods and findingsThe work shown here clusters participants in distinct and multifaceted progression subgroups of AD and discusses an approach to predict the progression rate from baseline diagnosis. We observed that the myriad of clinically reported symptoms summarized in the proposed AD progression space corresponds directly with memory and cognitive measures, which are routinely used to monitor disease onset and progression. Our analysis demonstrated accurate prediction of disease progression after four years from the first 12 months of post-diagnosis clinical data (Area Under the Curve of 0.96 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.92-1.0), 0.81 (95% CI, 0.74-0.88) and 0.98 (95% CI, 0.96-1.0) for slow, moderate and fast progression rate patients respectively). Further, we explored the long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict the trajectory of an individual patients progression.

ConclusionThe machine learning techniques presented in this study may assist providers in identifying different progression rates and trajectories in the early stages of the disease, hence allowing for more efficient and personalized healthcare deliveries. With additional information about the progression rate of AD at hand, providers may further individualize the treatment plans. The predictive tests discussed in this study not only allow for early AD diagnosis but also facilitate the characterization of distinct AD subtypes relating to trajectories of disease progression. These findings are a crucial step forward for early disease detection. These models can be used to design improved clinical trials for AD research.",0,576,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/792432v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/792432v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_792432.txt,1,general-purpose repository,1,to facilitate replication and  130  expansion of this study the python code (including the entire data preprocessing and machine  131  learning analysis) was made publicly available under gplv3 as part of the supplementary  132  information at https://github.com/vipul105/alzheimers_disease_progression.,to facilitate replication and  130  expansion of this study the python code (including the entire data preprocessing and machine  131  learning analysis) was made publicly available under gplv3 as part of the supplementary  132  information at https://github.com/vipul105/alzheimers_disease_progression. to facilitate replication and  130  expansion of this study the python code (including the entire data preprocessing and machine  131  learning analysis) was made publicly available under gplv3 as part of the supplementary  132  information at https://github.com/vipul105/alzheimers_disease_progression.

This process of mechano-electrical transduction (MET) requires a mechanically-gated channel localized in the apical stereocilia of hair cells. In mice, lipoma HMGIC fusion partner-like 5 (LHFPL5) acts as an auxiliary subunit of the MET channel whose primary role is to correctly localize PCDH15 and TMC1 to the mechanotransduction complex. Zebrafish have two lhfpl5 genes (lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b), but their individual contributions to MET channel assembly and function have not been analyzed.

Here we show that the zebrafish lhfpl5 genes are expressed in discrete populations of hair cells: lhfpl5a expression is restricted to auditory and vestibular hair cells in the inner ear, while lhfpl5b expression is specific to hair cells of the lateral line organ. Consequently, lhfpl5a mutants exhibit defects in auditory and vestibular function, while disruption of lhfpl5b affects hair cells only in the lateral line neuromasts. In contrast to previous reports in mice, localization of Tmc1 does not depend upon Lhfpl5 function in either the inner ear or lateral line organ. In both lhfpl5a and lhfpl5b mutants, GFP-tagged Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins still localize to the stereocilia of hair cells. Using a stably integrated GFP-Lhfpl5a transgene, we show that the tip link cadherins Pcdh15a and Cdh23, along with the Myo7aa motor protein, are required for correct Lhfpl5a localization at the tips of stereocilia. Our work corroborates the evolutionarily conserved co-dependence between Lhfpl5 and Pcdh15, but also reveals novel requirements for Cdh23 and Myo7aa to correctly localize Lhfpl5a. In addition, our data suggest that targeting of Tmc1 and Tmc2b proteins to stereocilia in zebrafish hair cells occurs independently of Lhfpl5 proteins.",1,149,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/793042v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/793042v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_793042.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here, we asked whether increasing attention to (i.e., the precision of) vision or proprioception would enhance performance in a hand-target phase matching task, in which visual and proprioceptive cues about hand posture were incongruent. We show that in a simple simulated agent--based on predictive coding formulations of active inference--increasing the expected precision of vision or proprioception improved task performance (target matching with the seen or felt hand, respectively) under visuo-proprioceptive conflict. Moreover, we show that this formulation captured the behaviour and self-reported attentional allocation of human participants performing the same task in a virtual reality environment.

Capitalizing on the growing wealth of bacterial sequence data, microbial GWAS methods aim to identify causal genetic variants while ignoring spurious associations. Bacteria reproduce clonally, leading to strong population structure and genome-wide linkage, making it challenging to separate true \""hits\"" (i.e. mutations that cause a phenotype) from non-causal linked mutations. GWAS methods attempt to correct for population structure in different ways, but their performance has not yet been systematically evaluated. Here we developed a bacterial GWAS simulator (BacGWASim) to generate bacterial genomes with varying rates of mutation, recombination, and other evolutionary parameters, along with a subset of causal mutations underlying a phenotype of interest. We assessed the performance (recall and precision) of three widely-used univariate GWAS approaches (cluster-based, dimensionality-reduction, and linear mixed models, implemented in PLINK, pySEER, and GEMMA) and one relatively new whole-genome elastic net model implemented in pySEER, across a range of simulated sample sizes, recombination rates, and causal mutation effect sizes. As expected, all methods performed better with larger sample sizes and effect sizes. The performance of clustering and dimensionality reduction approaches to correct for population structure were considerably variable according to the choice of parameters. Notably, the elastic net whole-genome model was consistently amongst the highest-performing methods and had the highest power in detecting causal variants with both low and high effect sizes. Most methods reached good performance (Recall > 0.75) to identify causal mutations of strong effect size (log Odds Ratio >= 2) with a sample size of 2000 genomes. However, only elastic nets reached reasonable performance (Recall = 0.35) for detecting markers with weaker effects (log OR [~]1) in smaller samples. Elastic nets also showed superior precision and recall in controlling for genome-wide linkage, relative to univariate models. However, all methods performed relatively poorly on highly clonal (low-recombining) genomes, suggesting room for improvement in method development. These findings show the potential for whole-genome models to improve bacterial GWAS performance. BacGWASim code and simulated data are publicly available to enable further comparisons and benchmarking of new methods.\n\nAuthor summaryMicrobial populations contain measurable phenotypic differences with important clinical and environmental consequences, such as antibiotic resistance, virulence, host preference and transmissibility. A major challenge is to discover the genes and mutations in bacterial genomes that control these phenotypes. Bacterial Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWASs) are family of methods to statistically associate phenotypes with genotypes, such as point mutations and other variants across the genome. However, compared to sexual organisms such as humans, bacteria reproduce clonally meaning that causal mutations tend to be strongly linked to other mutations on the same chromosome. This genome-wide linkage makes it challenging to statistically separate causal mutations from non-causal false-positive associations. Several GWAS methods are currently available, but it is not clear which is the most powerful and accurate for bacteria. To systematically evaluate these methods, we developed BacGWASim, a computational pipeline to simulate the evolution of bacterial genomes and phenotypes. Using simulated genomes, we found that GWAS methods varied widely in their performance. In general, causal mutations of strong effect (e.g. those under strong selection for antibiotic resistance) could be easily identified with relatively small samples sizes of around 1000 genomes, but more complex phenotypes controlled by mutations of weaker effect required 3000 genomes or more. We found that a recently-developed GWAS method called elastic net was particularly good at identifying causal mutations in highly clonal populations, with strong linkage between mutations - but there is still room for improvement.

These patterns are thought to be driven in part by reproductive mode and the interaction of selection and recombination, and recombination rates typically vary by chromosomal position. In the nematode C. elegans, repetitive elements are enriched at chromosome arms and depleted on centers, and this mirrors the chromosomal distributions of other genomic features such as recombination rate. How conserved is this genomic landscape of repeats, and what evolutionary forces maintain it? To address this, we compared the genomic organization of repetitive elements across five Caenorhabditis species with chromosome-level assemblies. As previously reported, repeat content is enriched on chromosome arms in most Caenorhabditis species, and no obvious patterns of repeat content associated with reproductive mode were observed. However, the fig-associated Caenorhabditis inopinata has experienced rampant repetitive element expansion and reveals no association of global repeat content with chromosome position. Patterns of transposable element superfamily-specific distributions reveal this global pattern is driven largely by a few transposable element superfamilies that in C. inopinata have expanded in number and have weak associations with chromosome position. Additionally, 15% of predicted protein-coding genes in C. inopinata align to transposon-related proteins. When these are excluded, C. inopinata has no enrichment of genes in chromosome centers, in contrast to its close relatives who all have such clusters. Forward evolutionary simulations reveal that chromosomal heterogeneity in recombination rate is insufficient for generating structured genomic repetitive landscapes. Instead, heterogeneity in the fitness effects of transposable element insertion is needed to promote heterogeneity in repetitive landscapes. Thus, patterns of gene density along chromosomes are likely drivers of global repetitive landscapes in this group, although other historical or genomic factors are needed to explain the idiosyncrasy of genomic organization of various transposable element taxa within C. inopinata.

Surprisingly, constitutive activation of PMK-3 using a gain-of-function MAP3K/DLK-1 mutant does not extend the life of wild-type worms due to dampening of the DLK-1/PMK-3 signaling axis with age. We further show that core components of the ESCRT-III machinery, including ISTR-1, CHMP2B (CC01A4.2) and RAB-11.1, are required for life extension following ETC disruption. ESCRT proteins are needed for extracellular vesicle (EV) formation, lysosomal traffic and other functions requiring membrane encapsulation away from the cytoplasm. Together, our findings underscore PMK-3 as a pivotal factor controlling life extension in worms following mitochondrial ETC disruption and illustrate the importance of the endomembrane system to this process.

The detection of antibodies against the structural proteins (SP) of the capsid can be used to monitor seroconversion in both infected and vaccinated animals. However, SP tests need to be tailored to the individual FMD virus serotype and their sensitivity performances may be affected by antigenic variability within each serotype and mismatching between tests reagents. As a consequence, FMD Reference Laboratories need to maintain contingency to employ multiple type-specific assays for large-scale serological surveillance and post-vaccination monitoring in the event of FMD outbreaks. In this study, a highly conserved region in the N terminus of FMDV capsid protein VP2 (VP2N) was characterised using a panel of intertypic-reactive monoclonal antibodies. This revealed a universal epitope in VP2N which could be used as a peptide antigen to detect FMDV-specific antibodies against all types of the virus. A VP2-peptide ELISA (VP2-ELISA) was optimised using experimental and reference antisera from immunized, convalescent and negative animals (n=172). The VP2-ELISA is universal, simple and provided sensitive (98.6 %) and specific (93%) detection of antibodies to all FMDV strains used in this study.

While such transitions have been previously studied in the context of competition for nutrients, the case of phage-induced bistability between competing bacterial species has not been considered yet. Here we demonstrate a possibility of regime shifts in well-mixed phage-bacterial ecosystems. In one of the bistable states the fast-growing bacteria competitively exclude the slow-growing ones by depleting their common nutrient. Conversely, in the second state the slow-growing bacteria with a large burst size generate such a large phage population that the other species cannot survive. This type of bistability can be realized as the competition between a strain of bacteria protected from phage by abortive infection and another strain with partial resistance to phage. It is often desirable to reliably control the state of microbial ecosystems, yet bistability significantly complicates this task. We discuss successes and limitations of one control strategy in which one adds short pulses to populations of individual species. Our study proposes a new type of phage therapy, where introduction of the phage is supplemented by addition of a partially resistant host bacteria.\n\nIMPORTANCEPhage-microbial communities play an important role in human health as well as natural and industrial environments. Here we show that these communities can assume several alternative species compositions separated by abrupt regime shifts. Our model predicts these regime shifts in the competition between bacterial strains protected by two different phage defense mechanisms: abortive infection/CRISPR and partial resistance. The history dependence caused by regime shifts greatly complicates the task of manipulation and control of a community. We propose and study a successful control strategy via short population pulses aimed at inducing the desired regime shifts. In particular, we predict that a fast-growing pathogen could be eliminated by a combination of its phage and a slower-growing susceptible host.",1,993,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/797456v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/797456v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_797456.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

So far, therapeutic options for ALS are extremely minimal and ineffective therefore, multi-faceted approaches such as treating the oxidative stress and inhibiting the TDP-43s aggregation are being actively pursued. In our recent study, an acridine imidazolium derivative compound, AIM4, has been identified to have anti-TDP-43 aggregation propensity however, its mechanism of inhibition is not deciphered. In this study, we have utilized computational methods to examine binding site(s) of AIM4 in the TDP-43 structure and have also compared its binding efficiency with several other relevant compounds. We find that AIM4 has a binding site in the C-terminal amyloidogenic core region of amino acids aa: 288-319, which coincides with one of the key residue motifs that could potentially mediate liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of TDP-43. Importantly, alike to the previously reported effects exerted by RNA molecules, we found that AIM4 could also inhibit the in vitro LLPS of a recombinantly purified C-terminal fragment TDP-432C bearing an A315T familial mutation. Antagonistic effects of AIM4 towards LLPS which is believed as the precursor process to the TDP-43s aggregation and the in silico prediction of a binding site of AIM4 on TDP-43 occurring in the same region, assert that AIM4 could be an important molecule for further investigations on TDP-43s anti-aggregation effects with relevance to the ALS pathogenesis.",1,1020,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/797613v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/797613v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_797613.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,in addition to the c-terminal region of tdp-43 the available structures of the tandem rrm domains (pdb id: 4bs2 aa: 96-269) [77] and nterminal domain (ntd) (pdb id: 2n4p aa: 1-89) [78] were also used for the docking studies.;     the lcd is enlarged to depict the sequences of the ten short amyloidogenic c-terminal peptide fragments whose structures have been determined and submitted to pdb database namely 5wia (aa: 370-375) 5wiq (aa: 396-402) 5wkd (aa: 300-306) 6cb9 (aa: 328-333) 6cew (aa: 321-326) 6cfh (aa: 333-343) 5whn (aa: 312317) 5whp (aa: 312-317 having a point mutation a315t) 6cf4 (aa: 312-317 having a315t mutation and phosphorylated thr-315) and 5wkb (aa: 312-317 having point mutation a315e).;     it is made available under acc-by-nc-nd 4.0 international license.  amyloidogenic short peptide region (aa: 312-317) (pdb id: 5whn) d.;     therefore blind docking of the ligands were also carried out against the available solution nmr structure of an n-terminal region (aa: 1-89; pdb id: 2n4p) of tdp-43 (figure 2a).,NA

Identification of signaling pathways that operate during the pre-erythrocytic cycle provides insights into a critical stage of infection and potential targets for chemoprevention of disease. Calcium Dependent Protein Kinases (CDPK) represent a kinase family that is present in Plasmodium but absent in mammals. We demonstrate that P. berghei homologs of CDPK1, CDPK4 and CDPK5 play overlapping but distinct roles in sporozoite invasion and parasite egress from hepatocytes. All three kinases are expressed in sporozoites. All three are required for optimal motility of sporozoites and consequently their invasion of hepatocytes. Increased cGMP compensates for the functional loss of CDPK1 and CDPK5 during sporozoite invasion but cannot overcome CDPK4s loss. CDPK1 and CDPK5 expression is downregulated after sporozoite invasion. CDPK5 reappears in a subset of late stage liver stages and is present in all merosomes. Chemical inhibition of CDPK4 and depletion of CDPK5 in liver stages suggests that these kinases play a role in the formation and/or release of merosomes from mature liver stages. Furthermore, depletion of CDPK5 in merosomes significantly delays a merosome-initiated erythrocytic cycle without affecting the infectivity of hepatic merozoites. These data suggest that CDPK5 is required for the release of hepatic merozoites from merosomes. Our work provides the first evidence that sporozoite invasion requires CDPK1 and CDPK5 and that the release of hepatic merozoites is a regulated process.\n\nSignificanceThe malaria-parasite Plasmodium begins its mammalian cycle by infecting hepatocytes in the liver. A single parasite differentiates into tens of thousands of hepatic merozoites which exit the host cell in vesicles called merosomes. Hepatic merozoites initiate the first round of erythrocytic infection that leads to disease symptoms. We show that optimal invasion of liver cells by Plasmodium requires the action of three closely-related parasite kinases, CDPK1, 4 and 5. Loss of any of the three enzymes in the parasite significantly reduces infection of liver cells. CDPK5 is also required for the release of hepatic merozoites from merosomes and therefore for initiating the erythrocytic cycle. A better understanding of how these kinases function could lead to drugs that prevent malaria.",1,1051,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/797886v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/797886v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_797886.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

However, identification of these epitopes and the principles governing their presentation has been hindered by the imprecision of currently available methods, which cannot fully recapitulate the complexity of human pathophysiology. We present a natural antigen processing assay (NAPA), which overcomes these limitations by studying the presentation of autoantigenic CD4+ T cell epitopes by monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mo-DCs) from patients. We applied this strategy to study the processing and presentation of topoisomerase-1 (TOP1), a prevalent autoantigen in scleroderma that is associated with lung fibrosis and high mortality. We found that a common set of 10 epitopes was presented by mo-DCs from patients with diverse HLA-DR variants, including those not previously associated with the disease. Sequence analysis revealed a shared peptide-binding motif within the HLA-DR peptide binding grooves of patients who developed anti-TOP1 autoantibodies. In addition, a subset of naturally presented TOP1 peptides were characterized by immunological promiscuity, as they could bind to diverse HLA-DR peptide binding grooves. NAPA epitopes were immunorelevant: they could stimulate autoreactive CD4+ T cells in patients, and the number of epitopes recognized correlated with lung disease severity. These findings mechanistically implicate presentation of a convergent set of TOP1 epitopes in the development of scleroderma lung disease. Precise identification of autoantigenic epitopes is key to understanding the primordial mechanisms for the loss of tolerance, studying disease-propagating autoreactive T cells, and developing antigen-specific immunotherapy.\n\nOne Sentence SummaryUse of a novel natural antigen processing assay reveals a mechanism for the presentation of shared CD4+ T cell epitopes of topoisomerase-I in immunogenetically diverse patients with scleroderma.",1,1022,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/798249v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/798249v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_798249.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Balance control is often impaired in clinical populations who walk with spatiotemporally asymmetric gait, and, as a result, rehabilitation efforts often seek to reduce asymmetries in these populations. Previous work has demonstrated that the presence of spatiotemporal asymmetries during walking does not impair the control of whole-body dynamics during perturbation recovery. However, it remains to be seen how the neuromotor system adjusts intersegmental coordination patterns to maintain invariant whole-body dynamics. Here, we determined if the neuromotor system generates stereotypical coordination patterns irrespective of the level of asymmetry or if the neuromotor system allows for variance in intersegmental coordination patterns to stabilize whole-body dynamics. Nineteen healthy participants walked on a dual-belt treadmill at a range of step length asymmetries, and they responded to unpredictable, slip-like perturbations. We used principal component analysis of segmental angular momenta to characterize intersegmental coordination patterns before, during, and after imposed perturbations. We found that two principal components were sufficient to explain ~ 95% of the variance in segmental angular momentum during both steading walking and responses to perturbations. Our results also revealed that walking with asymmetric step lengths led to changes in intersegmental coordination patterns during the perturbation and during subsequent recovery steps without affecting whole-body angular momentum. These results suggest that the nervous system allows for variance in segment-level coordination patterns to maintain invariant control of whole-body angular momentum during walking. Future studies exploring how these segmental coordination patterns change in individuals with asymmetries that result from neuromotor impairments can provide further insight into how the healthy and impaired nervous system regulates dynamic balance during walking.",1,450,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/799213v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/799213v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_799213.txt,0,NA,1,NA,it is made available under acc-by 4.0 international license.  139  was remotely triggered by preprogrammed python code and was characterized by a trapezoidal  140  speed profile in which the treadmill accelerated at foot strike to 1.5 m/s at an acceleration of 1.6  141  m/s2 held this speed for 0.3 s and then decelerated back to 1.0 m/s during the swing phase of the  142  perturbed leg.

Surprisingly though, we did not find a population response of putative DA neurons to the OS, contrary to predictions of standard temporal-difference models of DA neurons. However, despite the absence of a population response, putative DA neurons exhibited a heterogeneous response on a single unit level, so that some units increased and others decreased their activity as a response to the OS. Similarly, putative non-DA cells did not respond to the DS on a population level, but with heterogeneous responses on a single unit level. The heterogeneity in the responses of putative DA cells may reflect how DA neurons encode context and point to local differences in DA signalling.",1,527,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/799387v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/799387v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_799387.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Encoded by bacteriophage and phage-derived bacterial genes, Acrs prevent CRISPR-mediated inhibition of phage infection and can also block CRISPR-Cas-mediated genome editing in eukaryotic cells. To identify Acrs capable of inhibiting Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 (SauCas9), an alternative to the most commonly used genome editing protein Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpyCas9), we used both self-targeting CRISPR screening and guilt-by-association genomic search strategies. Here we describe three new potent inhibitors of SauCas9 that we name AcrIIA13, AcrIIA14 and AcrIIA15. These inhibitors share a conserved N-terminal sequence that is dispensable for anti-CRISPR function, and have divergent C-termini that are required in each case for selective inhibition of SauCas9-catalyzed DNA cleavage. In human cells, we observe robust and specific inhibition of SauCas9-induced genome editing by AcrIIA13 and moderate inhibition by AcrIIA14 and AcrIIA15. We also find that the conserved N-terminal domain of AcrIIA13-15 binds to an inverted repeat sequence in the promoter of these Acr genes, consistent with its predicted helix-turn-helix DNA binding structure.

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance (rsfMRI) work has revealed changes in static connectivity related to age, sex, cognitive abilities and psychiatric symptoms, yet little is known how these factors may alter the information flow. The commonly used approach infers functional brain connectivity using stationary coefficients yielding static estimates of the undirected connection strength between brain regions. Dynamic graphical models (DGMs) are a multivariate model with dynamic coefficients reflecting directed temporal associations between nodes, and can yield novel insight into directed functional connectivity. Here, we leveraged this approach to test for associations between edge-wise estimates of direction flow across the brain connectome and age, sex, intellectual abilities and mental health.

MethodsWe applied DGM to investigate patterns of information flow in data from 984 individuals from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 10,249 individuals from the UK Biobank.

ResultsOur analysis yielded patterns of directed connectivity in independent HCP and UK Biobank data similar to those previously reported, including that the cerebellum consistently receives information from other networks. We show robust associations between information flow and age and sex for several connections, with strongest effects of age observed in the sensorimotor network. Visual, auditory and sensorimotor nodes were also linked to mental health.

HRF models have been derived for sensory areas, where it is relatively clear what events cause a neural impulse response. However, this is obviously harder to do for higher order cortices such as prefrontal areas. Therefore, one HRF model is commonly used for analyzing activity throughout the brain, despite the fact that hemodynamics are known to vary across regions. For instance, several fMRI studies use a canonical HRF to analyze ventral striatum (VS) activity where converging evidence indicates that reward prediction error signals drive neural activity. However, the VS is a target of prominent dopaminergic projections, known to modulate vasculature and affect BOLD activity, suggesting that the HRF in the VS may be especially different from those in other brain areas. To address this, we use data from an experiment focused on learning from prediction-error signals to derive a VS-specific HRF model (VS-HRF). We show that this new VS-HRF increases statistical power in model comparison. Our result is of particular relevance to studies comparing computational models of learning and/or decision making in the VS, and for connectivity analyses, where the use of an (even slightly) inaccurate HRF model can lead to erroneous conclusions.

The ability of this dual pathogen to infest and kill an insect strongly depends on the dialogue between the hosts immune system and each partner of the complex. Even though this dialogue has been extensively studied from the two partners points of view in several insect models, still little is known about the structure and the molecular aspects of the insects immune response to the dual infection. Here, we used the lepidopteran pest Spodoptera frugiperda as a model to analyze the respective impact of each NBC partner in the spatiotemporal immune responses that are induced after infestation. To this aim, we first analyzed the expression variations of the insects immune genes in the fat bodies and hemocytes of infested larvae by using previously obtained RNAseq data. We then selected representative immune genes for RT-qPCR investigations of the temporal variations of their expressions after infestation and of their induction levels after independent injections of each partner. We found that the fat body and the hemocytes both produce potent and stable immune responses to the infestation by the NBC, which correspond to combinations of bacterium- and nematode-induced ones. Consistent with the nature of each pathogen, we showed that X. nematophila mainly induces genes classically involved in antibacterial responses, whereas S. carpocapsae is responsible for the induction of lectins and of genes expected to be involved in melanization and cellular encapsulation. In addition, we found that two clusters of unknown genes dramatically induced by the NBC also present partner-specific induction profiles, which paves the way for their functional characterization. Finally, we discuss putative relationships between the variations of the expression of some immune genes and the NBCs immunosuppressive strategies.\n\nAuthor summaryEntomopathogenic nematodes (EPNs) are living in the soil and prey upon insect larvae. They enter the insect by the natural orifices, and reach the hemocoel through the intestinal epithelium. There, they release their symbiotic bacteria that will develop within the insect and eventually kill it. Nematodes can then feed and reproduce on the insect cadaver. By using transcriptomic approaches, we previously showed that Lepidoptera larvae (caterpillars of the fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda) produce a strong immune response in reaction to infestation by EPNs. However, we do not know if this immune reaction is triggered by the nematode itself -Steinernema carpacapsae - or its symbiotic bacteria - Xenorhabdus nematophila. To answer this question, we present in this work a careful annotation of immunity genes in S. frugiperda and surveyed their activation by quantitative PCR in reaction to an injection of the bacteria alone, the axenic nematode or the associated complex. We found that the immune genes are selectively activated by either the bacteria or the nematode and we discuss the implication of which pathway are involved in the defense against various pathogens. We also show that a cluster of newly discovered genes, present only in Lepidoptera, is activated by the nematode only and could represent nematicide genes.",1,587,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/800656v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/800656v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_800656.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

FMRP binds brain mRNAs and inhibits polypeptide elongation. Using ribosome profiling of the hippocampus, we find that ribosome footprint levels in Fmr1-deficient tissue mostly reflect changes in RNA abundance. Profiling over a time course of ribosome runoff in wildtype tissue reveals a wide range of ribosome translocation rates; on many mRNAs, the ribosomes are stalled. Sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation of hippocampal slices after ribosome runoff reveals that FMRP co-sediments with stalled ribosomes; and its loss results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs. One such mRNA encodes SETD2, a lysine methyltransferase that catalyzes H3K36me3. ChIP-Seq demonstrates that loss of FMRP alters the deployment of this epigenetic mark on chromatin. H3K36me3 is associated with alternative pre-RNA processing, which we find occurs in an FMRP-dependent manner on transcripts linked to neural function and autism spectrum disorders.

Highlights- Loss of FMRP results in decline of ribosome stalling on specific mRNAs (eg., SETD2)

Alignment of the reads to their appropriate positions in the respective reference genome is the first but costliest step of any analysis pipeline based on SMRT sequencing. However, the state-of-the-art aligners often fail to identify distant homologies due to lack of conserved regions, caused by frequent genetic duplication and recombination. Therefore, we developed a novel alignment-free method of sequence mapping that is fast and accurate.

ResultsWe present a new mapper called S-conLSH that uses Spaced context based Locality Sensitive Hashing. With multiple spaced patterns, S-conLSH facilitates a gapped mapping of noisy long reads to the corresponding target locations of a reference genome. We have examined the performance of the proposed method on 5 different real and simulated datasets. S-conLSH is at least 2 times faster than the state-of-the-art alignment-based methods. It achieves a sensitivity of 99%, without using any traditional base-to-base alignment, on human simulated sequence data. By default, S-conLSH provides an alignment-free mapping in PAF format. However, it has an option of generating aligned output as SAM-file, if it is required for any downstream processing.

The synthetic lethal approach is attractive because it enables targeting of cancers harboring specific genomic alterations, the products of which may have proven refractory to direct targeting. An example is cancer driven by overexpression of MYC. Here, we conducted a high-content screen for compounds that are synthetic lethal to elevated MYC using a small-molecule library to identify compounds that are closely related to, or are themselves, regulatory-approved drugs. The screen identified dimethylfasudil, a potent and reversible inhibitor of Rho-associated kinases ROCK1 and ROCK2. Close analogs of dimethylfasudil are used clinically to treat neurologic and cardiovascular disorders. The synthetic lethal interaction was conserved in rodent and human cell lines and could be observed with activation of either MYC or its paralog MYCN. The synthetic lethality seems specific to MYC overexpressing cells as it could not be substituted by a variety of oncogenic manipulations and synthetic lethality was diminished by RNAi-mediated depletion of MYC in human cancer cell lines. Collectively, these data support investigation of the use of dimethylfasudil as a drug that is synthetic lethal for malignancies that specifically overexpress MYC.\n\nSignificance StatementSynthetic lethal targeting of tumors overexpressing MYC holds promise for attacking aggressive malignancies.

Amyloid formation of folded, globular proteins is commonly initiated by partial unfolding. However, how this unfolding event is triggered for proteins that are otherwise stable in their native environments is not well understood. The accumulation of the immunoglobulin protein {beta}2-microglobulin ({beta}2m) into amyloid plaques in the joints of long-term hemodialysis patients is the hallmark of Dialysis Related Amyloidosis (DRA). While {beta}2m does not form amyloid unassisted near neutral pH in vitro, the localization of {beta}2m deposits to joint spaces suggests a role for the local extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, specifically collagens, in promoting amyloid formation. Indeed, collagen and other ECM components have been observed to facilitate {beta}2m amyloid formation, but the large size and anisotropy of the complex, combined with the low affinity of these interactions, has limited atomic-level elucidation of the amyloid-promoting mechanism by these molecules. Using solution NMR approaches that uniquely probe weak interactions and large complexes, we are able to derive binding interfaces for collagen I on {beta}2m and detect collagen I-induced {micro}s-ms timescale dynamics in the {beta}2m backbone. By combining solution NMR relaxation methods and 15N-dark state exchange saturation transfer experiments, we propose a model in which weak, multimodal collagen I-{beta}2m interactions promote exchange with a minor population of an amyloid-competent species to induce fibrillogenesis.

Dipicolinic acid production has traditionally been recognized in Bacilli, Clostridia, and Paenibacilli. Here, sixty-seven strains of aerobic and anaerobic endospore-forming bacteria belonging to the genera Bacillus, Brevibacillus, Clostridium, Fontibacillus, Lysinibacillus, Paenibacillus, Rummeliibacillus, and Terribacillus were grown axenically and sporulated biomasses were assayed for dipicolinic acid production using fluorimetric detection.

Here using mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF), we investigate the ciliary roles of two mammalian orthologues of Chlamydomonas IFT-A gene, IFT139, namely Thm1 (also known as Ttc21b) and Thm2 (Ttc21a). Thm1 loss causes perinatal lethality, and Thm2 loss allows survival into adulthood. At E14.5, the number of Thm1;Thm2 double mutant embryos is lower than that for a Mendelian ratio, indicating deletion of Thm1 and Thm2 causes mid-gestational lethality. We examined the ciliary phenotypes of mutant MEF. Thm1-mutant MEF show decreased cilia assembly, shortened primary cilia, a retrograde IFT defect for IFT and BBS proteins, and reduced ciliary entry of membrane-associated proteins. Thm1-mutant cilia also show a retrograde transport defect for the Hedgehog transducer, Smoothened, and an impaired response to Smoothened agonist, SAG. Thm2-null MEF show normal ciliary dynamics and Hedgehog signaling, but additional loss of a Thm1 allele impairs response to SAG. Further, Thm1;Thm2 double mutant MEF show enhanced cilia disassembly, and relative to Thm1-null MEF, increased impairment of IFT81 retrograde transport and of INPP5E ciliary import. Thus, Thm1 and Thm2 have unique and redundant roles in MEF. Thm1 regulates cilia assembly, and together with Thm2, cilia disassembly. Moreover, Thm1 alone and together with Thm2, regulates ciliary protein trafficking, Hedgehog signaling, and embryogenesis. These findings shed light on mechanisms underlying Thm1-, Thm2- or IFT-A-mediated ciliopathies.",1,668,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/803544v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/803544v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_803544.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The non-Apis bees are vital invertebrates continued to be highly neglected in the tropics. We compared their diversity status, richness and composition across natural areas and agroecosystems in Doon valley, a subtropical-temperate landscape situated at the foothills of outer Himalayas in India. We investigated how two major habitats relate to non-Apis bee diversity, specifically seeking answers to (1) Whether natural habitat is a refuge to richer and rarer bee communities than agroecosystems? (2) Are natural habitats important for supporting wild bee populations in agroecosystems? (3) Do polyculture farms behave similar to natural habitats and therefore support richer bee communities than monoculture? Observation and pantrap sampling were used to collect data. We recorded 43 species belonging to bees of five families. The findings of our investigation demonstrate the importance of natural habitats as a potential refuge for non-Apis bees. The findings highlighted that Doon valley harboured twenty-five rare species of non-Apis bees, and natural habitats are a refuge to 11 rare specialist species (clamtest; Specialization threshold K = 2/3, Alpha level = 0.005). Natural habitat diversity in Doon valley supports bee communities in nearby agroecosystems (R2 = 0.782, SE = 0.148, P = 0.004).

Multiple genetic factors are involved in cavefish eye loss but none of the mutated genes have been identified. Here we identify cystathionine {beta}-synthase (cbsa), which encodes the key enzyme of the transsulfuration pathway, as a mutated gene responsible for eye degeneration in multiple cavefish populations. The inactivation of cbsa affects eye development by inducing accumulation of the transsulfuration intermediate homocysteine and defects in optic vasculature, including aneurysms and eye hemorrhages, leading to oxygen deficiency.

Thus, it is important that prescriptions are based on antimicrobial susceptibility data to ensure effective treatment outcomes. The increasing availability of next-generation sequencing (NGS), bacterial whole genome sequencing (WGS) can facilitate a more reliable and faster alternative to traditional phenotyping for the detection and surveillance of AMR.

This work proposes a machine learning approach that can predict the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for a given antibiotic, here ciprofloxacin, on the basis of both genome-wide mutation profiles and profiles of acquired antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG). We analysed 704 Escherichia coli genomes combined with their respective MIC measurements for ciprofloxacin originating from different countries. The four most important predictors found by the model, mutations in gyrA residues Ser83 and Asp87, a mutation in parC residue Ser80 and presence of any qnrS gene, have been experimentally validated before. Using only these four predictors in a linear regression model, 65% and 92% of the test samples MIC were correctly predicted within a two- and a four-fold dilution range, respectively. The presented work goes further than the typical predictions that use machine learning as a black box model concept. The recent progress in WGS technology in combination with machine learning analysis approaches indicates that in the near future WGS of bacteria might become cheaper and faster than a MIC measurement.

3. Impact statementWhole genome sequencing has become the standard approach to study molecular epidemiology of bacteria. However, the application of WGS in the clinical microbiology laboratory as part of individual patient diagnostics still requires significant steps forward, in particular with respect to prediction of antibiotic susceptibility based on DNA sequence. Whilst the majority of studies of prediction of susceptibility have used a binary outcome (susceptible/resistant), a quantitative prediction of susceptibility, such as the MIC, will allow for earlier detection of trends in increasing resistance as well as the flexibility to follow potential adjustments in definitions of susceptible (wild type) and resistant (non-wild type) categories (breakpoints/ epidemiological cut-off values).

4. Data summaryIn this study, 704 E. coli genomes combined with MIC measurement for ciprofloxacin were analysed (24). Paired-end sequencing was performed on all isolates and the results were stored in FASTQ format. The isolates originated from five countries, Denmark, Italy, USA, UK, and Vietnam. The MIC distribution for these isolates is depicted in Table 1. Out of 704, 266 E. coli genomes had no country metadata available and were used as an independent test set. All data were deposited in the AMR Data Hub (24) which consists of raw sequencing data, ciprofloxacin minimum inhibitory concentrations, and additional metadata such as the origin of the samples.

A multi-dimensional decomposition technique, parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis, has been validated for the identification of artifacts and cerebral activation patterns in electroencephalography and neuroimaging.

AimWe aimed at introducing and validating the use of the PARAFAC model for fNIRS data analysis, which is inherently multidimensional (time, space, wavelength).

ApproachEighteen healthy adults underwent fNIRS acquisition during a verbal fluency task. The signal-to-noise ratio and Pearsons correlation were used to evaluate the efficacy of PARAFAC for motion artifact correction. Temporal, spatial and hemodynamic characteristics of the PARAFAC component allowed to identify task-related cerebral activations.

ResultsMotion artifact correction with PARAFAC led to significant improvements in data quality and other advantages as compared to traditional 2D approaches (ICA, tPCA). Although PARAFAC revealed a slightly more distributed functional network, temporal and spatial characteristics of the task-related brain activation identified with PARAFAC mostly overlapped with those obtained with commonly used approaches.

ConclusionThis study describes the first implementation of PARAFAC in fNIRS and supports it as a promising data-driven alternative for multi-dimensional data analyses in fNIRS.",0,439,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/806778v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/806778v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_806778.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

To tune spatial and temporal control of potentials across ChR-enriched cell membranes, it is essential to understand how pore hydration impacts the ChR photocycle kinetics. Here, we measure channel opening and closing rates of channelrhodopsin chimera and selected variants (C1C2 wild type, C1C2-N297D, C1C2-N297V, and C1C2-V125L) and correlate them with changes in chemical interactions among functionally important residues in both closed and open states. Kinetic results substantiate that replacement of helices I and II in ChR2 with corresponding residues from ChR1, to make the chimera C1C2, affects the kinetics of channelrhodopsin pore gating significantly, making C1C2 a unique channel. As a prerequisite for studies of ion transport, detailed understanding of the water pathway within a ChR channel is important. Our atomistic simulations confirm that opening of the channel and initial hydration of the previously dry gating regions between helices I, II, III, and VII of the channel occurs with 1) the presence of 13-cis retinal; 2) deprotonation of a glutamic acid gating residue, E129; and 3) subsequent weakening of the central gate hydrogen bond between the same glutamic acid E129 and asparagine N282 in the central region of the pore. Also, an aspartate (D292) is the unambiguous primary proton acceptor for the retinal Schiff base in the hydrated channel.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEChannelrhodopsins (ChR) are light-sensitive ion channels used in optogenetics, a technique that applies light to selectively and non-invasively control cells (e.g., neurons) that have been modified genetically to express those channels. Using electrophysiology, we measured the opening and closing rates of a ChR chimera, and several variants, and correlated those rates with changes in chemical interactions determined from atomistic simulations. Significant new insights include correlation of single-point-mutations with four factors associated with pore hydration and cation conductance. Additionally, our work unambiguously identifies the primary proton acceptor for the retinal chromophore in the channel open state. These new insights add to mechanistic understanding of light-gated membrane transport and should facilitate future efforts to control membrane potentials spatially and temporally in optogenetics.",1,409,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/807909v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/807909v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_807909.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Nevertheless, there was no information on the identity of the Rysto gene. To begin to reveal the identification of Rysto, fine-scale genetic mapping was performed which, in combination with chromosome walking, narrowed down the locus of the gene to approximately 1 Mb.

Intriguingly, mRNAs encoding for antiviral factors bypass this translational shutoff, suggesting the presence of additional regulatory mechanisms enabling expression of the self-defence genes. Here, we identified the dsRNA binding protein ILF3 as an essential host factor required for efficient translation of the central antiviral cytokine, IFNB1, and a subset of interferon-stimulated genes. By combining polysome profiling and next-generation sequencing, ILF3 was also found to be necessary to establish the dsRNA-induced transcriptional and translational programs.

Less understood are the effects of temporary anxious states on learning and decision making in healthy populations. Here we follow proposals that anxious states in healthy individuals elicit a pattern of aberrant behavioural, neural, and physiological responses comparable with those found in anxiety disorders, particularly when processing uncertainty in unstable environments. In our study, both a state anxious and a control group learned probabilistic stimulus-outcome mappings in a volatile task environment while we recorded their electrophysiological (EEG) signals. By using a hierarchical Bayesian model, we assessed the effect of state anxiety on Bayesian belief updating with a focus on uncertainty estimates. State anxiety was associated with an underestimation of environmental and informational uncertainty, and an increase in uncertainty about volatility estimates. Anxious individuals deemed their beliefs about reward contingencies to be more precise and to require less updating, ultimately leading to impaired reward-based learning. We interpret this pattern as evidence that state anxious individuals are less tolerant to informational uncertainty about the contingencies governing their environment and more uncertain about the level of stability of the world itself. Further, we tracked the neural representation of belief update signals in the trial-by-trial EEG amplitudes. In control participants, both lower-level precision-weighted prediction errors (pwPEs) about the reward outcomes and higher-level volatility-pwPEs were represented in the ERP signals with an anterior distribution. A different pattern emerged under state anxiety, where a neural representation of pwPEs was only found for updates about volatility. Expanding previous computational work on trait anxiety, our findings establish that temporary anxious states in healthy individuals impair reward-based learning in volatile environments, primarily through changes in uncertainty estimates and potentially a degradation of the neuronal representation of hierarchically-related pwPEs, considered to play a central role in current Bayesian accounts of perceptual inference and learning.",1,674,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/809749v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/809749v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_809749.txt,1,general-purpose repository,0,cleaned eeg and preprocessed behavioural data files are available in the open science framework data repository: https://osf.io/b4qkp/.,NA

PNP inhibitors impair cell proliferation by preventing catabolism of the nucleoside deoxyguanosine (dG) which induces toxic imbalances amongst intracellular deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) pools following its phosphorylation and trapping by nucleoside kinases. We hypothesized that differential nucleoside uptake or catabolism defines cancer cell lines as either sensitive or resistant to PNP inhibition. Among cancer cell lines we found that T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) cells are uniquely and acutely sensitive to PNP inhibition whereas the B-cell leukemia and solid tumor models are completely resistant. We determined that although the nucleoside scavenging kinase deoxycytidine kinase (dCK) was active in all cells tested, PNP inhibitors only induced dGTP pool increases in sensitive models. By evaluating the expression of key genes involved in nucleotide scavenging, biosynthesis, and phosphohydrolysis in a panel of sensitive and resistant cell lines we found that the dNTP phosphohydrolase SAM histidine aspartate containing protein 1 (SAMHD1) was exclusively expressed in resistant models. Using CRISPR/Cas9 SAMHD1 knockout cell lines, we verified that PNP inhibitor sensitivity is a function of SAMHD1 expression and determined that the pharmacological inhibition of dCK or genetic restoration of SAMHD1 conferred resistance to PNP inhibition. Importantly, we determined that low expression of SAMHD1 is not limited to T-ALL as subset of established and primary solid tumors models are SAMHD1-deficient. These solid tumor models were consistently acutely sensitive to PNP inhibitors which indicates that the utility of PNP inhibitors extends beyond hematological malignancies. Additionally, we found that deoxycytidine (dC) can limit the anti-proliferative effects of PNP inhibitors by competing with dG for phosphorylation by dCK but this effect can be overcome by expression of dC-catabolizing gene cytidine deaminase (CDA).

We found that coexistence was neither dependent on an arms race between bacteria and phages, nor on the ability of phages to extend host range. Instead, our data suggest that some phage-inaccessible sites in the mucosa of the ileum serve as a spatial refuge for bacteria, which from there disseminate in the gut lumen.

We used the resulting MD trajectories to simulate X-ray diffraction and to study collective motions. The agreement of simulated X-ray diffraction with the data is comparable to previous MD simulation studies. We studied collective motions by analyzing statistically the covariance of alpha-carbon position displacements. The covariance decreases exponentially with the distance between atoms, which is consistent with a liquid-like motions (LLM) model, in which the protein behaves like a soft material. To gain finer insight into the collective motions, we examined the covariance behavior within a protein molecule (intra-protein) and between different protein molecules (inter-protein). The inter-protein atom pairs, which dominate the overall statistics, exhibit LLM behavior; however, the intra-protein pairs exhibit behavior that is consistent with a superposition of LLM and rigid-body motions (RBM). Our results indicate that LLM behavior of global dynamics is present in MD simulations of a protein crystal. They also show that RBM behavior is detectable in the simulations but that it is subsumed by the LLM behavior. Finally the results provide clues about how correlated motions of atom pairs both within and across proteins might manifest in diffraction data.

We investigated these questions in budding yeast, an organism found in diverse environments and therefore predicted to exhibit dynamic microtubules across a broad range of temperatures. We measured the dynamics of GFP-labeled microtubules in living cells and found that lowering the temperature from 37{degrees}C to 10{degrees}C decreased the rates of both polymerization and depolymerization, decreased the amount of polymer assembled before catastrophes and decreased the frequency of microtubule emergence from nucleation sites. Lowering to 4{degrees}C caused rapid loss of almost all microtubule polymer. We provide evidence that these effects on microtubule dynamics may be explained in part by changes in the co-factor-dependent conformational dynamics of tubulin proteins. Ablation of tubulin-binding co-factors further sensitizes cells and their microtubules to low temperatures, and we highlight a specific role for TBCB/Alf1 in microtubule maintenance at low temperatures. Finally, we show that inhibiting the maturation cycle of tubulin by using a point mutant in {beta}-tubulin confers hyper-stable microtubules at low temperatures, rescues the requirement for TBCB/Alf1, and improves the cold tolerance of the yeast.

SCARECROW (SCR) is a GRAS family gene essential for root growth and radial patterning in the Arabidopsis root. Previous studies showed that SCR promotes root growth by suppressing cytokinin response in the meristem, but there is also evidence that SCR expressed beyond the meristem is required as well for root growth. Here we report that SCR promotes root growth by promoting cell elongation through suppression of oxidative stress response and maintenance of redox homeostasis in the elongation zone. In the scr root, a higher level of hydrogen peroxide was detected, which can be attributed to down-regulation of peroxidase gene 3. When stress response was blocked or redox status was ameliorated by the aba2 or upb1 mutation, the scr mutant produced a significantly longer root with longer cells and a larger and mitotically more active meristem, even though the stem cell and radial patterning defects still persisted. We showed that WRKY15, an oxidative responsive gene, was a direct target of SCR down-regulated in the scr mutant, which suggests that SCR has an active role in suppressing oxidative stress response. Since hydrogen peroxide and peroxidases are essential for endodermal differentiation, these results suggest that SCR plays a central role in coordinating cell elongation, endodermal differentiation, redox homeostasis, and oxidative stress response in plant root.\n\nOne sentence summaryThis study reveals a novel mechanism of root growth regulation, which involves a previously unrecognized role of SCR in regulating cell elongation, endodermal differentiation, and redox homeostasis.",1,981,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/813774v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/813774v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_813774.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We describe here a sensitive, conditionally replication-defective yellow fever virus (YFV) entry reporter, YFV{Delta}SK/Nluc, to quantitively monitor the translation of incoming, virus particle-delivered genomes. We validated that YFV{Delta}SK/Nluc gene expression can be neutralized by YFV-specific antisera and requires known flavivirus entry pathways, including clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis, endosomal acidification, YFV E glycoprotein-mediated fusion, and cellular LY6E expression; however, as expected, gene expression from the defective reporter virus was insensitive to a small molecule inhibitor of YFV RNA replication. YFV{Delta}SK/Nluc gene expression was also shown to require cellular ubiquitylation, consistent with recent findings that dengue virus capsid protein must be ubiquitylated in order for nucleocapsid uncoating to occur, as well as valosin-containing protein (VCP)/p97, a cellular ATPase that unfolds and extracts ubiquitylated client proteins from large macromolecular complexes.

Currently, genetic and proteomic approaches are highly reported to detect metabolic disorders that also include inborn error of metabolisms. These existing detection methods are faced with cost issue and time consuming factors. Therefore, metabolites as biomarkers are one of potential avenues to detect metabolic disorders. Further, exploitation of urine as potential source of metabolite biomarkers, there are limitation in this area of research due to abundance of non-metabolite components such as proteins and nucleic acids. Hence, methods and processes are required to precisely fractionate metabolites from urine of inborn error of metabolism patients and then identified by analytical tools such as LC-HRMS and GC-MS.\n\nMethodsSterile filtered urine samples (750 {micro}l) mixed with (250 {micro}l) loading buffer were electrophoresed on VTGE that uses acrylamide gel (acrylamide:bisacrylamide, 30:1) as matrix of 15%.

However, to date, the organizing principles that underlie the morphogenesis of this network, and that shape the initial process of cell-cell finding remain elusive. Furthermore, it is unclear how in vitro results extrapolate to in vivo morphogenesis. Here, we identify a mechanism that allows cells to form networks by mechanically reorganizing and stiffening their extracellular matrix, independent of chemical guidance cues. Interestingly, we find that this cellular self-organization strongly depends on the connectivity and topology of the surrounding matrix, as well as on cell contractility and cell density. Cells rearrange the matrix, and form bridges of matrix material that are stiffer than their surroundings, thus creating a durotactic track for the initiation of cell-cell contacts. This contractility-based communication via strain stiffening and matrix rearrangement might be a general organizing principle during tissue development or regeneration.\n\nSignificance StatementIn addition to chemotactic gradients, biomechanical cues are important for guiding biological pattern formation. Self-assembly of cells has often been ascribed to reorganization of collagen fibres in the extracellular matrix. However, the basement membrane surrounding vascular cells, is per se non-fibrous. Here, we find that this difference in matrix topology can crucially influence cell behaviour and pattern formation. In a homogeneously elastic environment like the basement membrane, endothelial cells rearrange extracellular matrix proteins by contractile force, forming stiff intercellular bridges as tracks for cell-cell contacts. Our findings shine some light why there is a lot of merit in having multiple approaches to matrix elasticity (like continuum theories or dilated network approaches).

Multiple brain regions have been studied in the context of simple active vision tasks in which a visual targets appearance is temporally separated from saccade execution. Most neurons have tight spatial registration between visual and saccadic signals, and in areas such as prefrontal cortex (PFC) some neurons show persistent delay activity that links visual and motor epochs and has been proposed as a basis for spatial working memory. Many PFC neurons also show rich dynamics, which have been attributed to alternative working memory codes and the representation of other task variables. Our study investigated the transition between processing a visual stimulus and generating an eye movement in populations of PFC neurons in macaque monkeys performing a memory guided saccade task. We found that neurons in two subregions of PFC, the frontal eye fields (FEF) and area 8Ar, differed in their dynamics and spatial response profiles. These dynamics could be attributed largely to shifts in the spatial profile of visual and motor responses in individual neurons. This led to visual and motor codes for particular spatial locations that were instantiated by different mixtures of neurons, which could be important in PFCs flexible role in multiple sensory, cognitive, and motor tasks.\n\nNew and NoteworthyA central question in neuroscience is how the brain transitions from sensory representations to motor outputs.

Variability is not fully random, but often exhibits temporal dependencies. However, their measurement and interpretation come with several controversies, and their potential benefit for studying individual differences remains unclear. Two recent studies have linked individual differences in temporal structures to task performance on the same data, but with contrasting results. Here we use the metronome task, requiring participants to press a button in synchrony with a tone, widely used to study sensorimotor variability. We first investigate the intra-individual repeatability of the most common measures of temporal structures. Secondly, we examine inter-individual correlates of these measures with: 1) task performance assessed from the same data series, 2) meta-cognitive ratings of on-taskness from thought probes occasionally presented throughout the task, and 3) self-assessed traits commonly assumed to relate to attention or sensorimotor control (ADHD tendencies, mind wandering, and impulsivity). Autocorrelation at lag 1 and Power Spectra Density slope showed high repeatability and good correlations with task performance. Detrended Fluctuation Analysis slope showed the same pattern, but less reliably. The long-term component (d) of the ARFIMA(1,d,1) model shows poor repeatability and no correlation to performance. None of these measures showed external validity when correlated to either mean subjective attentional state or self-assessed traits between participants. In sum, some measures of serial dependencies may be stable individual traits, but their usefulness to study individual differences in other constructs typically associated with variability in performance remains elusive.",0,589,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/817916v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/817916v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_817916.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Some approaches suggest that these symptoms arise from deficits in the ability to anticipate and process rewards. However, evidence is equivocal with regard to ADHD-related differences in brain activity during reward processing. The aim of this study was to investigate when, and how, reward-related ERP activity was associated with hyperactive/impulsive symptoms and inattention symptoms. Adults with ADHD (n=34) and matched comparison participants (n=36) completed an electrophysiological version of the Monetary Incentive Delay task. This task separates reward processing into two stages-namely, an anticipation stage and a delivery stage. During the anticipation stage, visual cues signalled a possible monetary incentive (i.e. a reward or loss). After a brief delay, the delivery stage began, and incentives were delivered contingent on a speeded button-press. Electroencephalogram activity was simultaneously sampled and incentive-related event relate potentials (ERPs) calculated. These data were then analysed by calculating multiple regression models, at each sample point, wherein the correlation between incentive-related ERPs and ADHD symptoms was estimated. Linear and curvilinear associations between ERP activity and ADHD symptoms were tested in each regression mode. Findings suggest that ADHD symptoms were associated ERP activity at different reward processing stages. Hyperactive/impulsive symptoms were associated with reduced ERP activity during the initial anticipation of rewards from 224-329 ms post-reward cue. Inattention symptoms were associated with reduced ERP activity during the initial delivery of rewards from 251-280 ms post-reward onset. Finally, extreme ends of hyperactive/impulsive and inattention symptoms were associated with reduced ERP activity towards the end of the anticipation stage from 500 ms post-reward cue onwards. These results support the idea that reward processing is disrupted in ADHD while also shedding new light on the dynamic relationship between ADHD symptom dimensions and the neurological mechanisms of reward processing.",0,588,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/817973v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/817973v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_817973.txt,1,general-purpose repository,0,data and processing scripts are available  293  online (https://osf.io/k4hqz/).,NA

The expansion of this multidrug resistant pattern suggests that the treatment of S. rubidaea infections will become increasingly difficult in near future. Although some measures were taken to control this species, an inhibition mechanism is remaining unknown. To design effective means to control the dissemination of S. rubidaea, an in-depth analysis is required. In the present study, one possible candidate was isolated from the soil of Sundarban Mangroove Forest (Bangladesh) that has important physiological effects to inhibit this pathogenic bacterium. The bacterial isolate was initially identified as Bacillus amyloliquefaciens subsp. amyloliquefaciens using BIOLOG identification system and confirmed to be B. amyloliquefaciens strain through 16S rDNA sequence analysis. The growth and antagonistic activity of this potential strain was shown to be stable under wide range of pH, temperature and salinity (NaCl). Moreover, the novel B. amyloliquefaciens isolate can also inhibit Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other pathogenic bacteria.

Though the brain undergoes dramatic changes in connectivity during the first few years of life, how PAC changes through this developmental period has not been studied. Here, we examined PAC through electroencephalography (EEG) data collected longitudinally during an awake, eyes-open EEG collection paradigm in 98 children between the ages of 3 months and 3 years. We implement a novel technique developed for capturing both PAC strength and phase preference (i.e., where in the slower oscillation waveform the faster oscillation shows increased amplitude) simultaneously, and employed non-parametric clustering methods to evaluate our metrics across a range of frequency pairs and electrode locations. We found that frontal and occipital PAC, primarily between the alpha-beta and gamma frequencies, increased from early infancy to early childhood (p = 1.35 x 10-5). Additionally, we found frontal gamma coupled with the trough of the alpha-beta waveform, while occipital gamma coupled with the peak of the alpha-beta waveform. This opposing trend may reflect each regions specialization towards feedback or feedforward processing, respectively.\n\nSignificance StatementThe brain undergoes significant changes in functional connectivity during infancy and early childhood, enabling the emergence of higher-level cognition. Phase-amplitude coupling (PAC) is thought to support the functional connectivity of the brain. Here, we find PAC increases from 3 months to 3 years of age.

In vivo neuronal reprogramming has emerged as a novel technology to regenerate neurons from endogenous glial cells by forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors. We have previously demonstrated successful astrocyte-to-neuron conversion in mouse brains with injury or Alzheimers disease by overexpressing a single neural transcription factor NeuroD1 via retroviruses. Here we demonstrate regeneration of dorsal spinal cord neurons from reactive astrocytes after SCI via adeno-associated virus (AAV), a more clinically relevant gene delivery system. We find that NeuroD1 converts reactive astrocytes into neurons in the dorsal horn of stab-injured spinal cord with high efficiency ([~]95%). Interestingly, NeuroD1-converted neurons in the dorsal horn mostly acquire glutamatergic neuronal subtype, expressing spinal cord-specific markers such as Tlx3 but not brain-specific markers such as Tbr1, suggesting that the astrocytic lineage and local microenvironment affect the cell fate of conversion. Electrophysiological recordings show that the NeuroD1-converted neurons can functionally mature and integrate into local spinal cord circuitry by displaying repetitive action potentials and spontaneous synaptic responses. We further show that NeuroD1-mediated neuronal conversion can occur in the contusive SCI model, allowing future studies of evaluating this reprogramming technology for functional recovery after SCI.

Existing methods can provide exquisite targeting precision in favorable cases, but for many cases alternative techniques will be required. Here, we introduce a new step-wise combinatorial method for sequentially refining neuronal targeting: Depending on the restriction achieved at the first step, a second step can be easily implemented to further refine expression. For both steps, the new method relies on two independent intersections. The primary intersection targets neurons based on their developmental origins (i.e. lineage) and terminal identities, while the second intersection limits the number of lineages represented in the primary intersection by selecting lineages with overlapping activity of two distinct enhancers during neurogenesis. Our method relies critically on two libraries of 134 transgenic fly lines that express fragments of a split Cre recombinase under the control of distinct neuroblast enhancers. The split Cre fragments are fused to non-interacting pairs of split inteins, which ensure reconstitution of full-length and active Cre when all fragments are expressed in the same cell. Our split Cre system, together with its open source libraries, represent off-the-shelf components that should facilitate the targeting and characterization of brain circuits in Drosophila.

High levels of antioxidant metabolites in cells with reduced BRAFi sensitivity confirm this conclusion.

Understanding the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which males exhibit plasticity to different social cues remains poorly understood. Here, we show that SIFa modulates the neural circuitry for both LMD and SMD. Neuropeptide-to-neuropeptide communication, so called  neuropeptide relay plays a key role to mediate this control. We identified that 7 neuropeptides expressed in SIFa Receptor-positive cells are functionally important to regulate either LMD and/or SMD.

Using extreme sequence erosion (deletion and non-synonymous substitution) as an unambiguous signature of loss, we developed an automated approach for detecting high-confidence protein-coding gene loss events across a species tree. Our approach relies solely on gene annotation in a single reference genome, raw assemblies for the remaining species to analyze, and the associated phylogenetic tree for all organisms involved. Using the hg38 human assembly as a reference, we discovered over 500 unique human genes affected by such high-confidence erosion events in different clades across 58 mammals. While most of these events likely have benign consequences, we also found dozens of clade-specific gene losses that result in early lethality in outgroup mammals or are associated with severe congenital diseases in humans.

These typically track humans and evaluate the impact of control interventions in terms of human deaths, clinical cases averted, interruption of transmission etc. Genetic selection can be incorporated into these IBMs and used to track the spread of mutations whose origin and spread are often driven by the intervention, and which subsequently undermine the control strategy; for example, mutations which encode antimicrobial drug resistance or diagnosis- or vaccine-escape phenotypes. Basic population genetic descriptions of selection are based on infinite population sizes (so that chance fluctuations in allele frequency are absent) but IBMs track finite population sizes. We describe how the finite sizes of IBMs affect simulating the dynamics of genetic selection and how best to incorporate genetic selection into these models. We use the OpenMalaria IBM of malaria as an example, but the same principles apply to IBMs of other diseases. We identify four strategies to incorporate selection into IBMs and make the following four recommendations. Firstly, calculate and report the selection coefficients, s, of the advantageous allele as the key genetic parameter. Secondly, use these values of  s to calculate the wait-time until a mutation successful establishes itself in the population. The wait time for the mutation can be added to speed of selection, s, to calculate when the mutation will reach significant, operationally important levels. Thirdly, quantify the ability of the IBM to robustly estimate small selection coefficients. Fourthly, optimise computational efficacy: when  s is small it is plausible that fewer replicates of larger IBMs will be more efficient than a larger number of replicates of smaller size.",1,444,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/819367v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/819367v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_819367.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Existing approaches to address this spike bleed-through artifact relied on removing the average action potential waveforms of neurons, but this leaves artifacts in the LFP and distorts synchrony estimates.\n\nNew MethodWe describe a spike-removal method that surpasses these limitations by decomposing individual action potentials into their frequency components before their removal from the LFP. The adaptively estimated frequency components allow for variable spread, strength and temporal variation of the spike artifact.\n\nResultsThis adaptive approach effectively removes spike bleed-through artifacts in synthetic data with known ground truth, and in single neuron and LFP recordings in nonhuman primate striatum. For a large population of neurons with both narrow and broad action potential waveforms, the use of adaptive artifact removal uncovered 20-35 Hz beta and 35-45 Hz gamma band spike-LFP synchronization that would have remained contaminated otherwise.\n\nComparison with Existing MethodsWe demonstrate that adaptive spike-artifact removal cleans LFP data that remained contaminated when applying existing Bayesian and non-Bayesian methods of average spike-artifact removal.\n\nConclusionsApplying adaptive spike-removal from field potentials allows to estimate the phase at which neurons synchronize and the consistency of their phase-locked firing for both beta and low gamma frequencies.

It has been suggested that Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS), a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by lack of paternal expression at chromosome 15q11-q13, is characterised by hypothalamic insufficiency. Here, we investigate the role of the paternally expressed Snord116 gene within the context of sleep and metabolic abnormalities of PWS, and we report a novel role of this imprinted gene in the function and organisation of the two main neuromodulatory systems of the lateral hypothalamus (LH), namely, the orexin (OX) and melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) systems. We observe that the dynamics between neuronal discharge in the LH and the sleep-wake states of mice with paternal deletion of Snord116 (PWScrm+/p-) are compromised. This abnormal state-dependent neuronal activity is paralleled by a significant reduction in OX neurons in the LH of mutants. Therefore, we propose that an imbalance between OX- and MCH-expressing neurons in the LH of mutants reflects a series of deficits manifested in the PWS, such as dysregulation of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, food intake and temperature control.\n\nHighlightsO_LISnord116 regulates neuronal activity in the lateral hypothalamus (LH), which is time-locked with cortical states of sleep.\nC_LIO_LILoss of Snord116 reduces orexin neurons in the LH and affects sleep homeostasis and thermoregulation in mice.\nC_LIO_LISnord116 and Peg3 independently control orexin expression in the LH.\nC_LIO_LIPaternally expressed alleles maximize the patrilineal effects in the control of REM sleep by the LH in mammals.\nC_LI",0,779,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/820738v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/820738v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_820738.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,49   d  sua unit 1  eeg  gnd  unit 2  nose-poke activity 20  u1 u2 un  emg  0  spike/s  a  0 time  e  wireless trasmitter  baseline (b)  sleep pressure  spikes/s  b  b1  b2  12 10 8 6 4 2 0  w-max  *  *  wake  f  time  s-max  food deprication (fd)  spikes/s  sleep pressure food availability  sd1 sd2  sd3 time  sua recording  type ii  *  *  wake  sleep  type iii  10 5 before  after  before  b(b1 + b2) 5%  after  rb(sd2 + sd3)  9%  18%  before  after  food available  7% 19%  time  §  m+/p+  w-max 10%  s-max ws  eeg 86%  emg  31%  20  u1 u2 u3 u4 un  71%  75% $  15%  33%  $  13%  $ 30% 22%  spike/s  c  sleep  15  0  g  wake  type i 20  sleep deprivation (sd)  sleep  ws  type i  m+/p-  type ii  0 time  type iii    $§  p < 0.0001  54%  54%  49%  figure 1   bl  m+/p+  *  10  **  *  *  5 0  0  12  20 6 time [zt]  12  20  0  12 time [zt]  rb  theta  tnz  15 rem [%]  rem [%]  15  m+/p-  22°c 30°c  10  * *  5 0  20  normalized eeg power  a  m+/p+  m+/p-  **  1.2 1.0 0.8  m+/p-  0  12 20 time [zt]  d baseline  m+/p-  rebound  m+/p-  **  1.15 6  m+/p+  12 time [zt]  m+/p-  20  0  38 t-tail 36 34 32 30 1.5  hli  0.2 0.1  *  * *  * *  *  t-body 0  12 time [zt]  20  temperatur [°c]  38 36 34  3  *  2 1 0  m+/p-  1  zt 6 -

The stability of GQs increases with the number of G-quartets and three G-quartets generally form stable GQs. However, the stability of two-quartet GQs is an open issue. To understand the intrinsic stability of two-quartet GQ stems, we have carried out a series of unbiased molecular dynamics (MD) simulations ([~]505 {micro}s in total) of two- and four-quartet DNA and RNA GQs, with attention paid mainly to parallel-stranded arrangements. We used AMBER DNA parmOL15 and RNA parmOL3 force fields and tested different ion and water models. DNA two-quartet parallel-stranded GQs unfolded in all the simulations while the equivalent RNA GQ was stable in most of the simulations. GQs composed of two stacked units of two-quartet GQs were stable for both DNA and RNA. The simulations suggest that a minimum of three quartets are needed to form an intrinsically stable all-anti parallel-stranded DNA GQ. Parallel two-quartet DNA GQ may exist if substantially stabilized by another molecule or structural element, including multimerisation. On the other hand, we predict that isolated RNA two-quartet parallel GQs may form, albeit being weakly stable. We also show that ionic parameters and water models should be chosen with caution because some parameter combinations can cause spurious instability of GQ stems. Some in-so-far unnoticed limitations of force-field description of multiple ions inside the GQs are discussed, which compromise capability of simulations to fully capture the effect of increase of the number of quartets on the GQ stability.",1,753,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/820852v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/820852v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_820852.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,(pdb id 4r44 chains a-d; figure 1i).45 it is a tetramolecular gq with three k+ in the gq as the stabilizing ions; the structure is virtually identical to other available d[tggggt]4 structures.46 the coordinates for the dimer and monomer of two-quartet rna gq were taken from a solution structure of a dimer of two-rna gq units formed by the sequence 5'-r(gga)4-3' stacked through the 5'-5' interface (pdb id 2rqj first model; figure 1j).37 the head-to-head stacking means that quartets of the two subunits are of opposite directionality.,NA

However, the pathway underlying the light effect on mood remains unclear. Since a retino-raphe pathway was previously indicated to modulate 5-HT production, we hypothesize that the retinal projection into dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) may play an important role in the light therapy for depression.\n\nMethodsA rat model of 14-day corticosterone administration (40 mg/kg/day subcutaneous injection) was mainly used to test the effect of light therapy on non-seasonal depressant-like behavior, and the involved neural circuitry and neurochemistry as well.\n\nResultsBehavior results revealed that the bright light therapy especially with the blue light of 470 nm and 400 lux, effectively reversed the depression-like responses in those stressed rats. After elimination of retino-raphe projection using immunotoxin (Saporin) the effect of light therapy was significantly attenuated. Whereas activation of retino-raphe projection using HM3q chemogenetics was shown an effect similar to fluoxetine treatment. Furthermore, 5-HT3A positive GABA cells in the DRN were activated with high c-Fos expression that involved in an inhibition of 5-HT synthesis and a subsequent depressive behavior. While light therapy through retino-raphe projection deactivated the hyperaction of those GABA cells in the DRN; that eventually contributed to the antidepressant effect from light therapy.\n\nConclusionsOur results indicate that the retino-raphe circuitry engaged antidepressant effect in DRN that contributed to the light therapy to the non-seasonal depression. 5-HT3A positive GABA cells in DRN was indicated to mediate this function of retino-raphe projection.",0,926,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/821421v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/821421v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_821421.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Using an MLF2-based live cell imaging platform, we demonstrate that NE blebbing occurs rapidly and synchronously immediately after nuclear envelope reformation during mitosis. Bleb formation is independent of ubiquitin conjugation within the bleb, but strictly dependent on POM121, a transmembrane nucleoporin essential for interphase nuclear pore biogenesis. Nup358, a late marker for interphase nuclear pore complex (NPC) biogenesis, is underrepresented relative to FG nucleoporins in nuclear envelopes of Torsin-deficient cells.

Thus, it is imperative to understand the concept concerning the ground or naive pluripotent state of pluripotent stem cells, which was initially established in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). Putative human pluripotency has been proposed, largely based on comparing genome-wide transcriptomic signatures of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) with human pre-implantation embryos and mESCs by several research groups. Current bioinformatics approaches, however, have inevitable conceptual biases and technological limitations, including the choices of datasets, analytic methods, and interlaboratory data variability. In this report, we performed a multivariate meta-analysis of major hPSC datasets via the combined analytic powers of percentile normalization, principal component analysis (PCA), t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), and SC3 consensus clustering. This vigorous bioinformatics approach has significantly improved the predictive values of the current meta-analysis. Accordingly, we were able to reveal various fundamental inconsistencies between naive-like hPSCs and their human and mouse in vitro counterparts, which are likely attributed to interlaboratory protocol differences.

It is unclear which biochemical actors are responsible and whether the nucleus is pushed or pulled (or both) during deformation. Herein we use an easily-tunable poly-L-lactic acid micropillar topography, mimicking in vivo constrictions to determine the mechanisms responsible for nucleus deformation. Using biochemical tools, we determine that actomyosin contractility, vimentin and nucleo-cytoskeletal connections play essential roles in nuclear deformation, but not A-type lamins. We chemically tune the adhesiveness of the micropillars to show that pulling forces are predominantly responsible for the deformation of the nucleus. We confirm these results using an in silico cell model and propose a comprehensive mechanism for cellular and nuclear deformation during confinement.

However, preclinical imaging faces unique challenges that emphasize the gap between mouse and man. One example is the difference in breathing patterns and breath-holding ability, which can dramatically affect tumor burden assessment in lung tissue. As part of a co-clinical trial studying immunotherapy and radiotherapy in sarcomas, we are using micro-CT of the lungs to detect and measure metastases as a metric of disease progression. To effectively utilize metastatic disease detection as a metric of progression, we have addressed the impact of respiratory gating during micro-CT acquisition on improving lung tumor detection and volume quantitation. Accuracy and precision of lung tumor measurements with and without respiratory gating were studied by performing experiments with in vivo images, simulations, and a pocket phantom.

Most of these gains in productivity have been due to increasing cell numbers in the bioreactors, and with those increases in cell numbers, strategies have been developed to minimize metabolite waste accumulation, such as lactate and ammonia. Unfortunately, cell growth cannot occur without some waste metabolite accumulation, as central metabolism is required to produce the biopharmaceutical. Inevitably, metabolic waste accumulation leads to decline and termination of the culture. While it is understood that the accumulation of these unwanted compounds imparts a less than optimal culture environment, little is known about the genotoxic properties and the influence of these compounds on global genome instability. In this study, we examined the effects on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells genome sequences and physiology due to exposure to elevated ammonia levels. We identified genome-wide de novo mutations, in addition to variants in functional regions of certain genes involved in the mismatch repair (MMR) pathway, such as DNA2, BRCA1 and RAD52, which led to loss-of-function and eventual genome instability. Additionally, we characterized the presence of microsatellites against the most recent Chinese Hamster genome assembly and discovered certain loci are not replicated faithfully in the presence of elevated ammonia, which represents microsatellite instability (MSI).

We found that gene duplications roughly doubled the proto-eukaryotic genome, with families inherited from the Asgard archaea-related host being duplicated most. By relatively timing events using phylogenetic distances we inferred that duplications in cytoskeletal and membrane trafficking families were among the earliest events, whereas most other families expanded primarily after mitochondrial endosymbiosis.

FUS neuromodulation was targeted to the primary visual cortex in rhesus macaques and to subcortical locations, verified by MR-ARFI, in eleven sheep.

So far, the knowledge about underlying regulatory features of those resistance networks is sparse, since they can hardly be determined by experimentation alone. Here, we present the first computational approach to elucidate the interplay between multiple resistance modules against a single antibiotic, and how regulatory network structure allows the cell to respond to and compensate for perturbations of resistance. Based on the response of B. subtilis towards the cell wall synthesis-inhibiting antibiotic bacitracin, we developed a mathematical model that comprehensively describes the protective effect of two well-studied resistance modules (BceAB and BcrC) on the progression of the lipid II cycle. By integrating experimental measurements of expression levels, the model accurately predicts the efficacy of bacitracin against the B. subtilis wild-type as well as mutant strains lacking one or both of the resistance modules. Our study reveals that bacitracin-induced changes in the properties of the lipid II cycle itself control the interplay between the two resistance modules. In particular, variations in the concentrations of UPP, the lipid II cycle intermediate that is targeted by bacitracin, connect the effect of the BceAB transporter and the homeostatic response via BcrC to an overall resistance response. We propose that monitoring changes in pathway properties caused by a stressor allows the cell to fine-tune deployment of multiple resistance systems and may serve as a cost-beneficial strategy to control the overall response towards this stressor.\n\nImportanceAntibiotic resistance poses a major threat to global health and systematic studies to understand the underlying resistance mechanisms are urgently needed. Although significant progress has been made in deciphering the mechanistic basis of individual resistance determinants, many bacterial species rely on the induction of a whole battery of resistance modules, and the complex regulatory networks controlling these modules in response to antibiotic stress are often poorly understood. In this work we combine experiments and theoretical modelling to decipher the resistance network of Bacillus subtilis against bacitracin, which inhibits cell wall biosynthesis in Gram-positive bacteria. In response to bacitracin stress we find a high level of cross-regulation between the two major resistance modules and quantify their effects on bacterial resistance. To rationalize our experimental data, we expand a previously established computational model for the lipid II cycle through incorporating the quantitative action of the resistance modules. This leads us to a systems-level description of the bacitracin stress response network that captures the complex interplay between resistance modules and the essential lipid II cycle of cell wall biosynthesis and accurately predicts the minimal inhibitory bacitracin concentration in all the studied mutants. With this, our study highlights how bacterial resistance emerges from an interlaced network of redundant homeostasis and stress response modules.",1,845,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/827469v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/827469v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_827469.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The phenomenon has been well documented, but since sampling has only been conducted after travelers return home, data on the actual colonization process are scarce. We aimed to characterize colonization dynamics by exploring stool samples abroad on a daily basis while visiting LMIC.

MethodsA group of 20 European volunteers visiting Lao Peoples Democratic Republic for three weeks provided daily stool samples and filled in daily questionnaires. Acquisition of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing gram-negative bacteria (ESBL-GN) was examined by selective stool cultures followed by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of isolates.

ResultsWhile colonization rates were 70% at the end of the study, daily sampling revealed that all participants had acquired ESBL-GN at some time point during their overseas stay, the colonization status varying day by day. WGS analysis ascribed the transient pattern of colonization to sequential acquisition of new strains, resulting in a loss of detectable colonization by the initial MDR-GN strains. All but one participant acquired multiple strains (n=2-7). Of the total of 83 unique strains identified (53 E. coli, 10 Klebsiella, 20 other ESBL-GN species), some were shared by as many as four subjects.

ConclusionsThis is the first study to characterize in real time the dynamics of acquiring MDR-GN during travel. Our data show multiple transient colonization events indicative of constant microbial competition.",0,493,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/827915v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/827915v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_827915.txt,1,field-specific repository,0,raw sequence data for all isolates is available via ncbi under the bioproject accession number prjna558187.,NA

In total, we identified 4,193 proteins and 2,489 phosphoproteins, which are represented by 10,635 phosphopeptides.

However, humans are often motivated for an extremely challenging task with little chance of success, even without any extrinsic incentives. The current study aimed to address how the nature of the task (luck vs. skill) and the presence of extrinsic rewards modulate this challenge-based motivation, and its neural correlates. Participants played a game-like, skill-based task with three different probabilities of success (i.e., high, moderate, and extremely-low chance of success), in one group without performance-based rewards (no-reward group) and the other group with performance-based monetary rewards (reward group). Participants in the third group played a similar task but the reward outcome was determined in a probabilistic manner (gambling group). Participants in the no-reward group showed increased intrinsic motivation, as the chance of success decreased (i.e. the task becomes more difficult) even if the task was almost impossible to achieve. On the other hand, the reward group exhibited the highest intrinsic motivation when the task had a moderate chance of success, and participants in the gambling group showed decreased intrinsic motivation as the chance of success decreased. The ventral striatum and the ventral pallidum also showed similar patterns of activation. These results suggest that, both at the behavioral and neural levels, people are intrinsically motivated to challenge a nearly impossible task, but only when the task requires certain skills and extrinsic rewards are not available.",0,840,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/828756v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/828756v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_828756.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here, we used a genetically tractable Drosophila model and primary sensory neurons isolated from adult mouse to examine the mechanisms underlying CIPN and identify protective pathways. We found that chronic treatment of Drosophila larvae with paclitaxel caused sensory neuron degeneration, altered the terminal branching pattern of nociceptive neurons, and reduced thermal nociceptive responses. We found that nociceptive neuron-specific overexpression of integrins, which are known to support neuronal maintenance in several systems, conferred protection from paclitaxel-mediated cellular and behavioral phenotypes. Live imaging and superresolution approaches provide evidence that paclitaxel treatment causes cellular changes that are consistent with alterations in endosome-mediated trafficking of integrins. We used primary dorsal root ganglia neuron cultures to test conservation of integrin-mediated protection. We show that overexpression of a human integrin {beta} subunit 1 (ITGB1) also prevented degeneration following paclitaxel treatment.

As a result of this clonal expansion, an evolving bacterial population has different clonal composition over time, as revealed in the long-term evolution experiments (LTEEs). Accurately inferring the haplotypes of novel clones as well as the clonal frequencies and the clonal evolutionary history in a bacterial population is useful for the characterization of the evolutionary pressure on multiple correlated mutations instead of that on individual mutations.\n\nResultsIn this paper, we study the computational problem of reconstructing the haplotypes of bacterial clones from the variant allele frequencies observed from an evolving bacterial population at multiple time points. We formalize the problem using a maximum likelihood function, which is defined under the assumption that mutations occur spontaneously, and thus the likelihood of a mutation occurring in a specific clone is proportional to the frequency of the clone in the population when the mutation occurs. We develop a series of heuristic algorithms to address the maximum likelihood inference, and show through simulation experiments that the algorithms are fast and achieve near optimal accuracy that is practically plausible under the maximum likelihood framework. We also validate our method using experimental data obtained from a recent study on long-term evolution of Escherichia coli.\n\nConclusionWe developed efficient algorithms to reconstruct the clonal evolution history from time course genomic sequencing data.

The auditory steady-state response (ASSR) has been proposed as a neural measure for tracking selective auditory attention, even within continuous and complex soundscapes. However, the current literature is inconsistent on how the ASSR is influenced by selective attention, with findings based primarily on attention being directed to either ear rather than to sound content. In this experiment, a mixture of melody streams was presented to both ears identically (diotically) as we examined if selective auditory attention to sound content influences the ASSR. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we assessed the stream-specific ASSRs from three frequency-tagged melody streams when attention was directed between each melody stream, based on their respective pitch and timing. Our main results showed that selective attention enhances the ASSR power of an attended melody stream by 15 % at a general sensor level. This ability to readily capture attentional changes in a stimuli-precise manner makes the ASSR a useful tool for studying selective auditory attention, especially in complex auditory environments. Furthermore, as a secondary aim, we explored the distribution of cortical ASSR sources and their respective attentional modulation. A novel finding using distributed source modelling revealed that the ASSR is modulated by attention in many areas across the cortex, with frontal regions experiencing the strongest enhancement of up to ~ 80 %. ASSRs in the temporal and parietal cortices were enhanced by approximately 20 - 25 %. For future studies, this work can serve as a template to narrow-down possible sites of ASSR attentional modulation for further investigation.",1,771,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/836031v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/836031v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_836031.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

To investigate the consequences of formation of Amyloid-{beta} oligomers in living tissues, we developed a fluorescently tagged, optogenetic Amyloid-{beta} peptide that oligomerizes rapidly in the presence of blue light. We applied this system to the crucial question of how intracellular Amyloid-{beta} oligomers underlie the pathologies of Alzheimers Disease. We show that, although both expression and induced oligomerization of Amyloid-{beta} were detrimental to lifespan and healthspan, we were able to separate the metabolic and physical damage caused by light-induced Amyloid-{beta} oligomerization from Amyloid-{beta} expression alone. The physical damage caused by Amyloid-{beta} oligomers also recapitulated the catastrophic tissue loss that is a hallmark of late AD.

We constructed geographic and lineage specific MTB phylogenies and used Bayesian molecular dating to infer the most-recent-common-susceptible-ancestor age for 4,869 instances of resistance to 10 drugs.\n\nFindingsOf 8,550 isolates curated, 6,099 from 15 countries met criteria for molecular dating. The number of independent resistance acquisition events was lower than the number of resistant isolates across all countries, suggesting ongoing transmission of drug resistance. Ancestral age distributions supported the presence of old resistance, [&ge;]20 years prior, in the majority of countries. A consistent order of resistance acquisition was observed globally starting with resistance to isoniazid, but resistance ancestral age varied by country. We found a direct correlation between country wealth and resistance age (R2= 0.47, P-value= 0.014). Amplification of fluoroquinolone and second-line injectable resistance among multidrug-resistant isolates is estimated to have occurred very recently (median ancestral age 4.7 years IQR 1.9-9.8 prior to sample collection). We found the sensitivity of commercial molecular diagnostics for second-line resistance to vary significantly by country (P-value <0.0003)\n\nInterpretationOur results highlight that both resistance transmission and amplification are contributing to disease burden globally but are variable by country. The observation that wealthier nations are more likely to have old resistance suggests that programmatic improvements can reduce resistance amplification, but that fit resistant strains can circulate for decades subsequently.\n\nFundingThis work was supported by the NIH BD2K grant K01 ES026835, a Harvard Institute of Global Health Burke Fellowship (MF), Boston Childrens Hospital OFD/BTREC/CTREC Faculty Career Development Fellowship and Bushrod H.

Local factors driving evolution of drug resistance in MTB are not well studied.\n\nAdded value of this studyWe applied molecular dating to 6,099 global MTB patient isolates and found the order of resistance acquisition to be consistent across the countries examined, i.e. acquisition of isoniazid resistance first followed by rifampicin and streptomycin followed by resistance to other drugs. In all countries with data available there was evidence for transmission of resistant strains from patient-to-patient and in the majority for extended periods of time (>20 years).\n\nCountries with lower gross wealth indices were found to have more recent resistance acquisition to the drug rifampicin. Based on the resistance patterns identified in our study we estimate that commercial diagnostic tests vary considerably in sensitivity for second-line resistance diagnosis by country.\n\nImplications of all available evidenceThe longevity of resistant MTB in many parts of the world emphasizes its fitness for transmission and its continued threat to public health. The association between country wealth and recent resistance acquisition emphasizes the need for continued investment in TB care delivery and surveillance programs.

These technologies provide the opportunity to characterize genomic heterogeneity at single-cell resolution, but their extremely low sequencing coverage (<0.05X per cell) has thus far restricted their use to identification of the total copy number of large multi-megabase segments in individual cells. However, total copy numbers do not distinguish between the two homologous chromosomes in humans, and thus provide a limited view of tumor heterogeneity and evolution missing important events such as copy-neutral loss-of-heterozygosity (LOH). We introduce CHISEL, the first method to infer allele- and haplotype-specific copy numbers in single cells and subpopulations of cells by aggregating sparse signal across thousands of individual cells. We applied CHISEL to 10 single-cell sequencing datasets from 2 breast cancer patients, each dataset containing {approx}2000 cells. We identified extensive allele-specific copy-number aberrations (CNAs) in these samples including copy-neutral LOH, whole-genome duplications (WGDs), and mirrored-subclonal CNAs in subpopulations of cells. These allele-specific CNAs alter the copy number of genomic regions containing well-known breast cancer genes including TP53, BRCA2, and PTEN but are invisible to total copy number analysis. We utilized CHISELs allele- and haplotype-specific copy numbers to derive a more refined reconstruction of tumor evolution: timing allele-specific CNAs before and after WGDs, identifying low-frequency subclones distinguished by unique CNAs, and uncovering evidence of convergent evolution. This reconstruction is supported by orthogonal analysis of somatic single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) obtained by pooling barcoded reads across clones defined by CHISEL.",1,693,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/837195v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/837195v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_837195.txt,1,general-purpose repository,1,all the processed data for all sections of patient s0 and s1 as well as all the results of chisel are available on github at //github.com/raphael-group/chisel-data.  22  https:   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/837195; this version posted november 10 2019.,code availability chisel is available on github at https://github.com/raphael-group/chisel.  21   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/837195; this version posted november 10 2019.;     all the processed data for all sections of patient s0 and s1 as well as all the results of chisel are available on github at //github.com/raphael-group/chisel-data.  22  https:   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/837195; this version posted november 10 2019.

However, little is known about how vascular endothelial cells (ECs) regulate erythropoiesis. Here we identified that human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) keep erythroid cells undifferentiated and amplify their number. We determined that HUVECs amplify erythroid cells via secreted angiocrine factors. The expression profile of these factors suggested that they resemble macrophage-crines for enhanced erythropoiesis.

Sensitivity to the acute effects of initial drug exposure predicts later addiction vulnerability in both humans and animals, but the relationship of sensitivity to withdrawal from initial drug exposure and later drug use vulnerability is unclear. The goal of the current study was to evaluate whether the degree of anhedonia experienced during withdrawal from early opioid exposure predicts subsequent vulnerability to opioid addiction. Rats were first tested for withdrawal sensitivity following acute injections of morphine (i.e., ""acute dependence""), measured as elevations in intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS) thresholds (anhedonia-like behavior) during naloxone-precipitated and spontaneous withdrawal. Rats were then tested for addiction vulnerability using various measures of i.v. morphine self-administration (MSA) including acquisition, demand, extinction, and reinstatement induced by morphine, stress, and/or drug-associated cues. Greater naloxone-precipitated withdrawal across repeated morphine injections and greater peak spontaneous withdrawal severity following a single morphine injection were associated with lower addiction vulnerability on multiple MSA measures. Withdrawal-induced anhedonia predicted a wider range of MSA measures than did any individual measure of MSA itself. These data suggest that high anhedonia during withdrawal from initial opioid exposure is protective against subsequent opioid addiction vulnerability in rodents, thereby establishing one of the first behavioral measures to predict individual differences in opioid SA.

We sampled three distant but chemically similar hot springs in Yellowstone and Iceland that had outflows and presented a wide range of temperatures. The microbial composition at different niches was determined by deep DNA sequencing of rRNA gene amplicons. Over three dozen phyla of Archaea and Bacteria were identified, representing over 1700 unique organisms.

Study 2 assessed the role of ovarian hormones in withdrawal by comparing the same measures in OVX rats that received vehicle, E2, or E2+progesterone prior to testing. Briefly, rats received a sham surgery or an ovariectomy procedure. Fifteen days later, rats were prepared with a pump that delivered nicotine for 14 days. On the test day, rats received saline or the nicotinic receptor antagonist, mecamylamine to precipitate withdrawal. Physical signs and anxiety-like behavior were assessed on the elevated plus maze (EPM) and light-dark transfer (LDT) tests. During withdrawal, intact females displayed greater anxiety-like behavior and corticosterone levels as compared to male and OVX rats. Females tested in estrus (when E2 is relatively low) displayed less anxiety-like behavior and corticosterone versus all other phases. Anxiety-like behavior and corticosterone were positively correlated with E2 and negatively correlated with progesterone. Intact females displaying high E2/low progesterone displayed greater anxiety-like behavior and corticosterone as compared to females displaying low E2/high progesterone.

Analogous to this is comparing gene expression across species, which can improve our understanding of the evolutionary processes shaping the evolution of both individual genes and functional pathways. One area of interest is determining genes showing signals of coevolution, which can also indicate potential functional similarity, analogous to co-expression analysis often performed across conditions for a single species. However, as with any trait, comparing gene expression across species can be confounded by the non-independence of species due to shared ancestry, making standard hypothesis testing inappropriate.

ResultsWe compared RNA-Seq data across 18 fungal species using a multivariate Brownian Motion phylogenetic comparative method (PCM), which allowed us to quantify coevolution between protein pairs while directly accounting for the shared ancestry of the species. Our work indicates proteins which physically-interact show stronger signals of coevolution than randomly-generated pairs. Interactions with stronger empirical and computational evidence also showing stronger signals of coevolution. We examined the effects of number of protein interactions and gene expression levels on coevolution, finding both factors are overall poor predictors of the strength of coevolution between a protein pair. Simulations further demonstrate the potential issues of analyzing gene expression coevolution without accounting for shared ancestry in a standard hypothesis testing framework. Furthermore, our simulations indicate the use of a randomly-generated null distribution as a means of determining statistical significance for detecting coevolving genes with phylogenetically-uncorrected correlations, as has previously been done, is less accurate than PCMs, although is a significant improvement over standard hypothesis testing. These methods are further improved by using a phylogenetically-corrected correlation metric.

ConclusionsOur work highlights potential benefits of using PCMs to detect gene expression coevolution from high-throughput omics scale data. This framework can be built upon to investigate other evolutionary hypotheses, such as changes in transcription regulatory mechanisms across species.",1,762,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/844472v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/844472v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_844472.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

SuEVs were collected longitudinally from both the donor and the recipient in 22 living donor kidney transplantations. Unbiased proteomic analysis revealed specific temporal patterns of suEV proteins indicative of the cellular processes involved in the allografts response after transplantation with proteins playing a role in complement activation being among the most dynamically regulated components. Using a leave-one-out cross validation model, we identified potential prognostic markers of kidney function at 1 year after transplantation.

On the contrary, we found that NK cells serve a homeostatic role during influenza virus infection of vaccinated mice, allowing viral clearance with minimal pathology. Using a diphtheria toxin receptor transgenic mouse model, we were able to specifically deplete NKp46+ NK cells through the administration of diphtheria toxin. Using this model, we assessed the effect of NK cell depletion prior to influenza challenge in vaccinated and unvaccinated mice. NK-depleted, vaccinated animals lost significantly more weight after viral challenge than vaccinated NK intact animals, indicating that NK cells ameliorate disease in vaccinated animals. However, there was also a significant reduction in viral load in NK-depleted, unvaccinated animals indicating that NK cells also constrain viral clearance. Depletion of NK cells after vaccination, but 21 days before infection, did not affect viral clearance or weight loss - indicating that it is the presence of NK cells during the infection itself that promotes homeostasis.

The peptidoglycan (PG) cell wall is the primary determinant of cell shape. At the molecular level, morphological variation often results from the regulation of enzymes involved in cell elongation and division. These enzymes are spatially controlled by cytoskeletal scaffolding proteins, that both recruit and organize the PG synthesis complex. How then do cells define alternative morphogenic processes that are distinct from cell elongation and division? To address this, we have turned to the specific morphotype of Alphaproteobacterial stalks. Stalk synthesis is a specialized form of zonal growth, which requires PG synthesis in a spatially constrained zone to extend a thin cylindrical projection of the cell envelope. The morphogen SpmX defines the site of stalk PG synthesis, but SpmX is a PG hydrolase. How then does a non-cytoskeletal protein, SpmX, define and constrain PG synthesis to form stalks? Here we report that SpmX and the bactofilin BacA act in concert to regulate stalk synthesis in Asticcacaulis biprosthecum. We show that SpmX recruits BacA to the site of stalk synthesis. BacA then serves as a stalk-specific topological organizer for PG synthesis activity, including its recruiter SpmX, at the base of the stalk. In the absence of BacA, cells produce ""pseudostalks"" that are the result of unconstrained PG synthesis. Therefore, the protein responsible for recruitment of a morphogenic PG remodeling complex, SpmX, is distinct from the protein that topologically organizes the complex, BacA.",1,349,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/847335v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/847335v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_847335.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Following neutrophil arrest, adhesion stabilization occurs as the neutrophil interacts with the endothelial surface and crawls into a favorable position for extravasation. The cytoskeletal protein vinculin has been implicated in other cell types as a regulator of adhesion strength by promoting focal adhesion maturation and as a sensor of the mechanical properties of the microenvironment. Neutrophils express vinculin but do not form mature focal adhesions. Here, we characterize the role of vinculin in {beta}2 integrin-dependent neutrophil adhesion, motility, mechanosensing, and recruitment. We observe that knockout of vinculin attenuates, but does not completely abrogate, neutrophil adhesion, spreading, and crawling under static conditions. In the presence of forces from fluid flow, vinculin was not required for neutrophil adhesion or migration. Vinculin deficiency only mildly attenuated neutrophil traction stresses and spreading on stiff, but not soft, polyacrylamide gels indicating a minor role for vinculin in the mechanosensing of the neutrophil as compared to slower moving mesenchymal cells that form mature focal adhesions. Consistent with these findings, we observe in vivo neutrophil recruitment into the inflamed peritoneum of mice remains intact in the absence of vinculin. Together, these data suggest that while vinculin regulates some aspects of neutrophil adhesion and spreading, it may be dispensable for neutrophil recruitment and motility in vivo.",1,420,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/847780v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/847780v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_847780.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The mapping process relies on sub-lexical statistical regularities (e.g., ""oo"" to |u{square}|) or on learned lexical associations between a specific visual form and a series of sounds (e.g., yacht to /j{square}t/). Computational, neuroimaging, and neuropsychological evidence suggest that sub-lexical, phonological and lexico-semantic processes rely on partially distinct neural substrates: a dorsal (occipito-parietal) and a ventral (occipito-temporal) route, respectively.

Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal features of orthography-to-phonology mapping, capitalizing on the time resolution of magnetoencephalography and the unique clinical model offered by patients with semantic variant of Primary Progressive Aphasia (svPPA). Behaviorally, svPPA patients manifest marked lexico-semantic impairments including difficulties in reading words with exceptional orthographic to phonological correspondence (irregular words). Moreover, they present with focal neurodegeneration in the anterior temporal lobe (ATL), affecting primarily the ventral, occipito-temporal, lexical route. Therefore, this clinical population allows for testing of specific hypotheses on the neural implementation of the dualroute model for reading, such as whether damage to one route can be compensated by over-reliance on the other. To this end, we reconstructed and analyzed time-resolved whole-brain activity in 12 svPPA patients and 12 healthy age-matched controls while reading irregular words (e.g., yacht) and pseudowords (e.g., pook).

Consistent with previous findings that the dorsal route is involved in sub-lexical, phonological processes, in control participants we observed enhanced neural activity over dorsal occipito-parietal cortices for pseudowords, when compared to irregular words. This activation was manifested in the beta-band (12-30 Hz), ramping up slowly over 500 ms after stimulus onset and peaking at [~]800 ms, around response selection and production. Consistent with our prediction, svPPA patients did not exhibit this temporal pattern of neural activity observed in controls this contrast. Furthermore, a direct comparison of neural activity between patients and controls revealed a dorsal spatiotemporal cluster during irregular word reading. These findings suggest that the sub-lexical/phonological route is involved in processing both irregular and pseudowords in svPPA.

Together these results provide further evidence supporting a dual-route model for reading aloud mediated by the interplay between lexico-semantic and sub-lexical/phonological neuro-cognitive systems. When the ventral route is damaged, as in the case of neurodegeneration affecting the ATL, partial compensation appears to be possible by over-recruitment of the slower, serial attention-dependent, dorsal one.

Abbreviated SummaryBorghesani et al. investigate brain dynamics during irregular word reading using magnetoencephalographic imaging in patients with semantic variant of primary progressive aphasia. Due to ventral anterior temporal lobe neurodegeneration, patients show greater reliance of dorsal, occipito-parietal brain regions - providing novel evidence for the interplay between ventral and dorsal routes for reading.",0,526,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/847798v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/847798v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_847798.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Strain-level investigations are beginning to reveal the molecular mechanisms used by VREfm to colonize regions of the human bowel. However, the role of commensal bacteria during VREfm colonization, in particular following antibiotic treatment, remains largely unknown. We employed amplicon 16S rRNA gene sequencing and metabolomics in a murine model system to try and investigate functional roles of the gut microbiome during VREfm colonization. First-order taxonomic shifts between Bacteroidetes and Tenerricutes within the gut microbial community composition were detected both in response to pretreatment using ceftriaxone, and to subsequent VREfm challenge. Using neural networking approaches to find co-occurrence profiles of bacteria and metabolites, we detected key metabolome features associated with butyric acid during and after VREfm colonization. These metabolite features were associated with Bacteroides, indicative of a transition towards a pre-antibiotic naive microbiome. This study shows the impacts of antibiotics on the gut ecosystem, and the progression of the microbiome in response to colonisation with VREfm. Our results offer insights towards identifying potential non-antibiotic alternatives to eliminate VREfm through metabolic re-engineering to preferentially select for Bacteroides.

Both synthesis and degradation of the (p)ppGpp alarmone nucleotide are mediated by RelA-SpoT Homolog (RSH) enzymes which can be broadly divided in two classes: single-domain  short and multi-domain  long RSH. The regulatory ACT (Aspartokinase, Chorismate mutase and TyrA) / RRM (RNA Recognition Motif) domain is a near-universal C-terminal domain of long RSHs. Deletion of RRM in both monofunctional (synthesis-only) RelA as well as bifunctional (i.e. capable of both degrading and synthesising the alarmone) Rel renders the long RSH cytotoxic due to overproduction of (p)ppGpp. To probe the molecular mechanism underlying this effect we characterised Escherichia coli RelA and Bacillus subtilis Rel RSHs lacking RRM. We demonstrate that, first, the cytotoxicity caused by the removal of RRM is counteracted by secondary mutations that disrupt the interaction of the RSH with the starved ribosomal complex - the ultimate inducer of (p)ppGpp production by RelA and Rel - and, second, that the hydrolytic activity of Rel is not abrogated in the truncated mutant. Therefore, we conclude that the overproduction of (p)ppGpp by RSHs lacking the RRM domain is not explained by a lack of auto-inhibition in the absence of RRM or/and a defect in (p)ppGpp hydrolysis.

The NQO1 bioactivatable agent {beta}-lapachone can target cells with high NQO1 expression but relies in the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which are actively scavenged in cells with NRF2/KEAP1 mutations. However, whether NRF2/KEAP1 mutations influence the response to {beta}-lapachone treatment remains unknown. To address this question, we assessed the cytotoxicity of {beta}-lapachone in a panel of NSCLC cell lines bearing either wild-type or mutant KEAP1. We found that, despite overexpression of NQO1, KEAP1 mutant cells were resistant to {beta}-lapachone due to enhanced detoxification of ROS, which prevented DNA damage and cell death. To evaluate whether specific inhibition of the NRF2-regulated antioxidant enzymes could abrogate resistance to {beta}-lapachone, we systematically inhibited the four major antioxidant cellular systems using genetic and/or pharmacologic approaches. We demonstrated that inhibition of the thioredoxin-dependent system or copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) could abrogate NRF2-mediated resistance to {beta}-lapachone, while depletion of catalase or glutathione was ineffective. Interestingly, inhibition of SOD1 selectively sensitized KEAP1 mutant cells to {beta}-lapachone exposure. Our results suggest that NRF2/KEAP1 mutational status might serve as a predictive biomarker for response to NQO1-bioactivatable quinones in patients. Further, our results suggest SOD1 inhibition may have potential utility in combination with other ROS inducers in patients with KEAP1/NRF2 mutations.

A critical step in assessing the various adaptive hypotheses is establishing the functional capacities and limits of QS.

Here we show that Pseudomonas aeruginosa can deliver a graded response to variation in environmental population density on both the population and individual scales.

While terrestrial camera-trapping studies have shown that capture frequency, along with the species movement speed and detector specifications can be used to estimate absolute densities, the approach has not yet been adapted to cases where movement occurs in three dimensions. Frameworks based on animal movement patterns allow estimating population density from camera-trapping data when animals are not individually distinguishable.
C_LIO_LIHere we adapt one such framework to three-dimensional movement to characterize the relationship between population density, animal speed, characteristics of a remote sensors detection zone, and detection frequency. The derivation involves defining the detection zone mathematically and calculating the mean area of the profile it presents to approaching individuals.
C_LIO_LIWe developed two variants of the model - one assuming random movement of all individuals, and one allowing for different probabilities for each approach direction (e.g. that animals more often swim/fly horizontally than vertically). We used computer simulations to evaluate model performance for a wide range of animal and detector densities. Simulations show that in ideal conditions the method approximates true density well, and that estimates become increasingly accurate using more detectors, or sampling for longer. Moreover, the method is robust to invalidation of assumptions, accuracy is decreased only in extreme cases where all detectors are facing the same way.
C_LIO_LIWe provide equations for estimating population density from detection frequency and outline how to estimate the necessary parameters. We discuss how environmental variables and species-specific characteristics affect parameter estimates and how to account for these differences in density estimations.
C_LIO_LIOur method can be applied to common remote detection methods (cameras and acoustic detectors), which are currently being used to study a diversity of species and environments. Therefore, our work may significantly expand the number and diversity of species for which density can be estimated.

Here we introduce the Non-Equilibrium Reaction-Diffusion Self-assembly Simulator (NERDSS), which addresses this gap by integrating a structure-resolved reaction-diffusion algorithm with rule-based model construction. By representing proteins as rigid, multi-site molecules that adopt well-defined orientations upon binding, NERDSS simulates formation of large reversible structures with sites that can be acted on by reaction rules. We show how NERDSS allows for directly comparing and optimizing models of multi-component assembly against time-dependent experimental data. Applying NERDSS to assembly steps in clathrin-mediated endocytosis, we capture how the formation of clathrin caged structures can be driven by modulating the strength of clathrin-clathrin interactions, by adding cooperativity, or by localizing clathrin to the membrane. NERDSS further predicts how clathrin lattice disassembly can be driven by enzymes that irreversibly change lipid populations on the membrane. By modeling viral lattice assembly and recapitulating oscillations in protein expression levels for a circadian clock model, we illustrate the wide usability and adaptability of NERDSS.

We investigated the genomic patterns of introgression from Aegilops tauschii, the diploid ancestor of the wheat D genome, into winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) cultivars. The population of 351 BC1F3:5 lines was selected based on phenology from crosses between six hexaploid wheat lines and 21 wheat-Ae. tauschii octoploids. SNP markers developed for this population and a diverse panel of 116 Ae. tauschii accessions by complexity-reduced genome sequencing were used to detect introgression based on the identity-by-descent analysis. Overall, introgression frequency positively correlated with recombination rate, with a high incidence of introgression at the ends of chromosomes and low in the pericentromeric regions, and was negatively related to sequence divergence between the parental genomes. Reduced introgression in the pericentromeric low-recombining regions spans nearly 2/3 of each chromosome arm, suggestive of the polygenic nature of introgression barriers that could be associated with multilocus negative epistasis between the alleles of wild and cultivated wheat. On the contrary, negative selection against the wild allele of Tg, controlling free-threshing trait and located in the high-recombining chromosomal region, led to reduced introgression only within [~]10 Mbp region around Tg.

Consequently, data analyses require the computation and storage of multiple metrics for a wide range of ribosome footprint lengths. We developed a software ecosystem including a new efficient binary file format named  ribo. Ribo files store all essential data grouped by ribosome footprint lengths. Users can assemble ribo files using our RiboFlow pipeline that processes raw ribosomal profiling sequencing data. RiboFlow is highly portable and customizable across a large number of computational environments with built-in capabilities for parallelization. We also developed interfaces for writing and reading ribo files in the R (RiboR) and Python (RiboPy) environments. Using RiboR and RiboPy, users can efficiently access ribosome profiling quality control metrics, generate essential plots, and carry out analyses.

The central domain binds the lipid-bound common polysaccharide antigen, allowing the pyocin to accumulate on the cell surface.

However, knowledge about the complex zoonotic transmission cycle is limited, hampering implementation of control strategies. We explored the feeding behavior and activity of the vector (Phlebotomus pedifer) and established the role of livestock in CL transmission.

MethodsBlood meal origins of engorged sand flies were determined by sequencing host DNA. A host choice experiment was performed to assess the feeding preference of P. pedifer when humans and hyraxes are equally accessible. Ear and nose biopsies from goats and bovines were screened for the presence of Leishmania parasites. Sand flies were captured indoor and outdoor with human landing catches (HLC) and CDC light traps to determine at which time and where P. pedifer is mostly active.

Principal findingsA total of 180 sand flies were found to bite hosts of 12 genera. Humans were the predominant blood meal source (59.4%, p < 0.001) in all habitats, even in caves, where hyraxes are abundant. Only 10.6% of the sand flies fed on hyraxes based on the blood meal analysis, but the host choice experiment revealed that sand flies have a significant preference for feeding on hyraxes over humans (p = 0.009) when hosts are equally accessible. Only a single goat nose biopsy from 412 animal samples was found with Leishmania RNA. We found that P. pedifer is predominantly endophagic (p = 0.003), but occurs both indoors and outdoors. A substantial amount of sand flies was active in the early evening, which increased over time reaching its maximum around midnight.

ConclusionWe indicate that Leishmania transmission in southwestern Ethiopia is, in contrast to earlier suggestions, likely mainly anthroponotic and that livestock does not play a role in transmission. Combined indoor and outdoor vector control measures at night are required for efficient vector control.

Author summaryCutaneous leishmaniasis is a major public health problem in Ethiopia. It is caused by Leishmania aethiopica protozoa that are transmitted when female sand flies take a blood meal. Hyraxes are assigned as the reservoirs of the infection, because many were found infected with Leishmania. There is very limited knowledge about the behavior of sand flies and other potential hosts of the infection. However, this information is a prerequisite for disease control, which is currently hampered. In this study, we found that humans are likely the main source of the infection and that the role of hyraxes in disease transmission needs further investigation to decide whether they should be included in control programs. Livestock appears not play a role in transmission, even though sand flies like to feed on them. We also show that sand flies are active indoors and outdoors, but have a preference for feeding inside human dwellings and that they are mostly active around midnight. Overall, we conclude that disease prevention and control should emphasize on human protection by applying vector control indoors, at night.",1,998,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/856187v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/856187v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_856187.txt,1,supplement,0,656  s1 data: dataset of blood meal sources of phlebotomus pedifer captured in different months and different  657  habitats.;     658  s2 data: binomial dataset of sand fly activity indoors and outdoor based on human landing catches (hlc).;     659  s3 data: dataset of activity of cave collected phlebotomus pedifer sand flies based on cdc light trap  660  captures.;     661  s4 data: dataset of host choice experiment.       biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/856187; this version posted november 26 2019.,NA

We used these relationships to predict the origin regions for birds migrating along the two flyways from the measured isotope values of migrants feathers and the associated hydrogen and oxygen isotopic composition of precipitation where these feathers were formed. The birds from the two migration routes had overlap in their natal/breeding origins and did not differentiate into fully separate migratory populations, with birds from the Pacific Coast Migratory Flyway showing broader natal geographic origins then those from the Intermountain Flyway. The methodology based on oxygen isotopes had, in general, less predictive power than the one based on hydrogen. There was broad agreement between the two isotope approaches in the geographic assignment of the origins of birds migrating along the Pacific Coast Flyway, but not for those migrating along the Intermountain Migratory Flyway. These results are discussed in terms of their implications for conservation efforts of A. striatus in western North America, and the use of combined hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope analysis to track the movement of birds of prey on continental scales.",1,926,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/856278v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/856278v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_856278.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

A typical example is the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) during mitosis, which regulates kinetochore PP1 and PP2A-B56 activities to switch-off signalling events at the correct time. In this case, kinetochore phosphatase activation dephosphorylates MELT motifs on KNL1 to remove SAC proteins, including the BUB complex. We show here that, surprisingly, neither PP1 or PP2A are required to dephosphorylate the MELT motifs. Instead, they remove polo-like kinase 1 (PLK1) from the BUB complex, which can otherwise maintain MELT phosphorylation in an autocatalytic manner. This is their principle role in the SAC, because both phosphatases become redundant if PLK1 is inhibited or BUB-PLK1 interaction is prevented. Therefore, phosphatase regulation is critical for the SAC, but primarily to restrain and extinguish autonomous kinase activity. We propose that these circuits have evolved to generate a semi-autonomous SAC signal that can be synchronously silenced following kinetochore-microtubule tension.",1,325,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/856773v2?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/856773v2.full.pdf,_10.1101_856773.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Human DNA is typically removed from microbial reads either by subtractive alignment (dropping all reads that map to the human genome) or using a read classification tool to predict those of human origin, and then discarding them. To inform best practice guidelines, we benchmarked 8 alignment-based and 2 classification-based methods of human read detection using simulated data from 10 clinically prevalent bacteria and 3 viruses, into which contaminating human reads had been added.

While the majority of methods successfully detected > 99% of the human reads, they were distinguishable by variance. The most precise methods, with negligible variance, were Bowtie2 and SNAP, both of which misclassified few, if any, bacterial reads (and no viral reads) as human. While correctly detecting a similar number of human reads, methods based on taxonomic classification, such as Kraken2 and Centrifuge, often misclassified bacterial reads as human, the extent of which was species-specific. Among the most sensitive methods of human read detection was BWA, although this also made the greatest number of false positive classifications. Across all methods, the set of human reads not identified as such, although often representing < 0.1% of the total reads, were non-randomly distributed along the human genome with many originating from the repeat-rich sex chromosomes.

For viral reads and longer (> 300bp) bacterial reads, the highest performing approaches were classification-based, using Kraken2 or Centrifuge. For shorter (150-300bp) bacterial reads, combining multiple methods of human read detection maximised the recovery of human reads from contaminated short read datasets without being compromised by false positives. The highest-performing approach with shorter bacterial reads was a two-stage classification using Bowtie2 followed by SNAP. Using this approach, we re-examined 11,577 publicly archived bacterial readsets for hitherto undetected human contamination. We were able to extract a sufficient number of reads to call known human SNPs, including those with clinical significance, in 6% of the samples.

One such pathway - the uncinate fasciculus (UF) - connects the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) to the medial temporal lobes (MTL) and has been associated with early life adversity, maltreatment, anxiety, and depression. While it is purported to play a role in episodic memory and discrimination, its exact function remains poorly understood. We have previously described the role of the amygdala and dentate (DG)/CA3 fields of the hippocampus in the mnemonic discrimination of emotional experiences (i.e. emotional pattern separation). However, how this computation may be modulated by connectivity between the medial temporal lobes and the orbitofrontal cortex remains unknown. Here we ask the question of whether the uncinate fasciculus plays a role in influencing MTL subregional activity during emotional pattern separation. By combining diffusion imaging with high-resolution functional MRI, we found that reduced integrity of the UF is related to higher activation in the DG/CA3 subregions of the hippocampus during an emotional pattern separation task. We additionally report that higher levels of DG/CA3 activity are associated with poorer memory performance, suggesting that hyperexcitability in this network (which may be driven by CA3 recurrent collaterals) is associated with memory errors and that the UF may allow the OFC to exert inhibitory control on this network and improve discrimination of emotional experiences.

In this work, we thoroughly evaluate PCA with varying number of PCs alongside LMM in various realistic scenarios, including admixture together with family structure, measuring both null p-value uniformity and the area under the precision-recall curves. We find that PCA performs as well as LMM when enough PCs are used and the sample size is large, and find a remarkable robustness to extreme number of PCs. However, we notice decreased performance for PCA relative to LMM when sample sizes are small and when there is family structure, although LMM performance is highly variable.

Reductive dechlorination of CF to dichloromethane (DCM) was observed in enrichment cultures derived from sediments of Lake Strawbridge, which has been reported as a natural source of CF. The lack of CF removal in the abiotic control cultures without artificial electron donors indicated that the observed CF removal is a biotic process. Metabolite analysis with 13C labelled CF in the sediment-free enrichment cultures (pH 8.5, salinity 5%) revealed that increasing the vitamin B12 concentration from 0.04 to 4 M enhanced CF removal, reduced DCM formation, and increased 13CO2 production, which is likely a product of CF oxidation. Known organohalide-respiring bacteria and reductive dehalogenase genes were neither detected by quantitative PCR nor metagenomic analysis. Rather, members of the order Clostridiales, known to co-metabolically transform CF to DCM and CO2, were detected in the enrichment cultures. Genome-resolved metagenome analysis indicated that their genomes encode enzymatic repertoires for the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway and cobalamin biosynthesis that are known to be involved in co-metabolic CF transformation.

ImportanceMore than 90% of the global CF emission to the atmosphere originates from natural sources, including saline environments such as salt lake sediments.

Mechanistic models of signaling pathways have already proven to be useful tools for understanding relevant aspects of cell functionality. Here we propose to use this mechanistic modeling strategy to deconvolute the complexity of the functional behavior of a tissue by dissecting it into the individual functional landscapes of its component cells by using a single-cell RNA-seq experiment of glioblastoma cells. This mechanistic modeling analysis revealed a high degree of heterogeneity at the scale of signaling circuits, suggesting the existence of a complex functional landscape at single cell level. Different clusters of neoplastic glioblastoma cells have been characterized according to their differences in signaling circuit activity profiles, which only partly overlap with the conventional glioblastoma subtype classification. The activity of signaling circuits that trigger cell functionalities which can easily be assimilated to cancer hallmarks reveals different functional strategies with different degrees of aggressiveness followed by any of the clusters.

In addition, mechanistic modeling allows simulating the effect of interventions on the components of the signaling circuits, such as drug inhibitions. Thus, effects of drug inhibitions at single cell level can be dissected, revealing for the first time the mechanisms that individual cells use to avoid the effect of a targeted therapy which explain why and how a small proportion of cells display, in fact, different degrees of resistance to the treatment.

This established an evolutionary scenario, where T-cell immunotherapy imposed a dynamic fitness switch on wild-type melanoma cells and antigen loss variants, which resulted in highly variable enrichment of the latter in recurrent tumors. Stochastic simulations by an individual-based continuous-time Markov process suggested variable fitness of subclones within the antigen loss variant population as the most likely cause, which was validated experimentally.

Recent studies suggest that individuals with either pharmacologically enhanced levels of dopamine (DA) or higher baseline levels of DA exhibit more MB control. However, it remains unknown whether such pharmacological effects depend on baseline DA.

Here, we investigated whether effects of L-DOPA on the balance of MB/MF control depend on ventral striatal baseline DA. Sixty participants had two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while performing a two-stage sequential decision-making task under 150 mg L-DOPA or placebo (counterbalanced), followed by a 4-hour 18F-DOPA positron emission tomography (PET) scan (on a separate occasion).

We found an interaction between baseline DA levels and L-DOPA induced changes in MB control. Individuals with higher baseline DA levels showed a greater L-DOPA induced enhancement in MB control. Surprisingly, we found a corresponding drug-by-baseline DA interaction on MF, but not MB learning signals in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. We did not find a significant interaction between baseline DA levels and L-DOPA effects on MF control or MB/MF balance.

In sum, our findings point to a baseline dependency of L-DOPA effects on differential aspects of MB and MF control. Individual differences in DA washout may be an important moderator of L-DOPA effects. Overall, our findings complement the general notion where higher DA levels is related to a greater reliance on MB control. Although the relationship between phasic DA firing and MF learning is conventionally assumed in the animal literature, the relationship between DA and MF control is not as straightforward and requires further clarification.",0,835,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/860361v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/860361v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_860361.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

The American cockroach, inhabiting dark shelters with a rather stable olfactory landscape, is equipped with long antennae used for sampling the surrounding air-space for orientation and navigation. The antennaes exceptional length provides a wide spatial working range for odour detection; however, it is still largely unknown whether and how this is also used for mapping the structure of the olfactory environment. By selective labelling antennal lobe projection neurons with a calcium sensitive dye, we investigated the logic of olfactory coding in this hemimetabolous insect. We show that odour responses are stimulus-specific and concentration-dependent, and that structurally related odorants evoke physiologically similar responses. By using spatially confined stimuli, we show that proximal stimulations induce stronger and faster responses than distal ones. Spatially confined stimuli of the female pheromone periplanone-B activate sub-region of the male macroglomerulus. Thus, we report that the combinatorial logic of odour coding deduced from holometabolous insects applies also to this hemimetabolous species. Furthermore, a fast decrease in sensitivity along the antenna, not supported by a proportionate decrease in sensillar density, suggests a neural architecture that strongly emphasizes neuronal inputs from the proximal portion of the antenna.

In the field of visual neuroscience, with the ability to explain how neurons in primary visual cortex work, population receptive field (pRF) models have enjoyed high popularity and made reliable progress in recent years. However, existing models rely on either the inflexible prior assumptions about pRF or the clumsy parameter estimation methods, severely limiting the expressiveness and interpretability. In this paper, we propose a novel neural encoding framework by learning ""what"" and ""where"" with deep neural networks. The modeling approach involves two separate aspects: the spatial characteristic (""where"") and feature selection (""what"") of neuron populations in visual cortex. Specifically, we use the receptive field estimation and multiple features regression to learn these two aspects respectively, which are implemented simultaneously in a deep neural network. The two forms of regularizations: sparsity and smoothness, are also adopted in our modeling approach, so that the receptive field can be estimated automatically without prior assumptions about shapes. Furthermore, an attempt is made to extend the voxel-wise modeling approach to multi-voxel joint encoding models, and we show that it is conducive to rescuing voxels with poor signal-to-noise characteristics. Extensive empirical results demonstrate that the method developed herein provides an effective strategy to establish neural encoding for human visual cortex, with the weaker prior constraints but the higher encoding performance.

Author summaryCharacterizing the quantitative relationship between the stimuli and the evoked brain activities usually involves learning the spatial characteristic (""where"") and feature selection (""what"") of neuron populations. As an effective strategy, we propose a novel end-to-end ""what"" and ""where"" architecture to perform neural encoding. The proposed modeling approach consists of receptive field estimation and multiple features regression, which learns ""where"" and ""what"" simultaneously in a deep neural network. Different from previous methods, we use the sparsity and smoothness regularizations in the deep neural network to guide the receptive field estimation, so that the receptive field for each voxel can be estimated automatically. Moreover, in consideration of computational similarities between adjacent voxels, we made an attempt to extend the proposed modeling approach to multi-voxel joint encoding models, improving the encoding performance of voxels with poor signal-to-noise characteristics. Empirical evaluations show that the proposed method outperforms other baselines to achieve the state-of-the-art performance.",1,820,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/861989v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/861989v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_861989.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

This mismatch of time scales is a long-standing weakness in synaptic theories of memory. Here we use spectrally separated optogenetic stimulation to fire precisely timed action potentials (spikes) in CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells. Twenty minutes after optogenetic induction of STDP (oSTDP), we observed timing-dependent depression (tLTD) and timing-dependent potentiation (tLTP), depending on the sequence of spiking. As oSTDP does not require electrodes, we could also assess the strength of these paired connections three days later. At this late time point, late tLTP was observed for both causal (CA3 before CA1) and anti-causal (CA1 before CA3) timing, but not for asynchronous activity patterns ({Delta}t = 50 ms). Blocking activity after induction of oSTDP prevented stable potentiation. Our results confirm that neurons wire together if they fire together, but suggest that synaptic depression after anti-causal activation (tLTD) is a transient phenomenon.

Previous research has shown that activity in the dopaminergic midbrain can be endogenously modulated via neurofeedback, suggesting potential for non-pharmacological interventions. However, the robustness of endogenous modulation, a requirement for clinical translation, is unclear. Here, we examined how self-modulation capability relates to regulation transfer. Moreover, to elucidate potential mechanisms underlying successful self-regulation, we studied individual prediction error coding, and, during an independent monetary incentive delay (MID) task, individual reward sensitivity. Fifty-nine participants underwent neurofeedback training either in a veridical or inverted feedback group. Successful self-regulation was associated with post-training activity within the cognitive control network and accompanied by decreasing prefrontal prediction error signals and increased prefrontal reward sensitivity in the MID task. The correlative link of dopaminergic self-regulation with individual differences in prefrontal prediction error and reward sensitivity suggests that reinforcement learning contributes to successful self-regulation. Our findings therefore provide new insights in the control of dopaminergic midbrain activity and pave the way to improve neurofeedback training in neuropsychiatric patients.",0,942,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/863639v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/863639v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_863639.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

One important regulator of cell polarity is the centrosome, which acts as a microtubule organizing center. Excess centrosomes perturb aspects of endothelial cell polarity linked to migration, but whether centrosome number influences apical-basal polarity and cell-cell junctions is unknown. Here, we show that excess centrosomes alter the apical-basal polarity of endothelial cells in angiogenic sprouts and disrupt endothelial cell-cell adherens junctions. Endothelial cells with excess centrosomes had narrower lumens in a 3D sprouting angiogenesis model, and zebrafish intersegmental vessels had reduced perfusion following centrosome overduplication. These results indicate that endothelial cell centrosome number regulates proper lumenization downstream of effects on apical-basal polarity and cell-cell junctions. Endothelial cells with excess centrosomes are prevalent in tumor vessels, suggesting how centrosomes may contribute to tumor vessel dysfunction.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.View Full Text",1,428,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/863787v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/863787v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_863787.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Here, we uncover that host immune suppression is key for dinoflagellate endosymbionts to avoid elimination by the host using a comparative, model systems approach. Unexpectedly, we find that the clearance of non-symbiotic microalgae occurs by non-lytic expulsion (vomocytosis) and not intracellular digestion, the canonical mechanism used by professional immune cells to destroy foreign invaders.

Moreover, these methods are selective, targeting a subset of species at the time, and can be inaccessible to certain areas. Here, we explore the potential of environmental DNA (eDNA), the DNA present in the water column as part of shed cells, tissues or mucus, to provide comprehensive information about fish diversity in a large marine area. Further, eDNA results were compared to the fish diversity obtained in pelagic trawls. A total of 44 5L-water samples were collected onboard a wide-scale oceanographic survey covering about 120,000 square kilometres in Northeast Atlantic Ocean. A short region of the 12S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced through metabarcoding generating almost 3.5 million quality-filtered reads. Trawl and eDNA samples resulted in the same most abundant species (European anchovy, European pilchard, Atlantic mackerel and blue whiting), but eDNA metabarcoding resulted in more detected fish and elasmobranch species (116) than trawling (16). Although an overall correlation between fish biomass and number of reads was observed, some species deviated from the common trend, which could be explained by inherent biases of each of the methods. Species distribution patterns inferred from eDNA metabarcoding data coincided with current ecological knowledge of the species, suggesting that eDNA has the potential to draw sound ecological conclusions that can contribute to fish surveillance programs.

We applied representational similarity analysis (RSA [3]) and timefrequency analysis to EEG data during an item-method directed forgetting experiment [4]. We identified neural signatures of both the intentional suppression and the voluntary upregulation of item-specific representations. Successful active forgetting was associated with a downregulation of item-specific representations in an early time window, 500ms after the instruction. This process was initiated by an increase in oscillatory alpha (8-13 Hz) power, a well-established signature of neural inhibition [5,6], in occipital brain areas. During a later time window, 1500ms after the cue, intentional forgetting was associated with reduced employment of active rehearsal processes, as reflected by an attenuated upregulation of item-specific representations as compared to intentionally encoded items.

Using various biochemical and biophysical approaches, we show that CX3CL1 clusters are homo-oligomers with 3 to 7 CX3CL1 molecules.

Molecular modeling suggests that transmembrane peptide oligomers are mostly made of monomers linearly assembled side by side. Using a new adherence assay, we demonstrate that, functionally, oligomerization is mandatory for the adhesive potency of CX3CL1.

In biophysical terms, substrate selectivity may be determined not just by the structural and chemical complementarity between the kinase and its protein substrates, but also by the free energy difference between the conformational ensembles that are recognized by the kinase and those that are not. To test this hypothesis, we developed an informatics framework based on statistical thermodynamics, which allows us to probe for dynamic contributions to phosphorylation, as evaluated by the ability to predict Ser/Thr/ Tyr phosphorylation sites in the disordered proteome. Essential to this framework is a decomposition of substrate sequence information into two types: vertical information encoding conserved kinase specificity motifs and horizontal (distributed) information encoding substrate conformational dynamics that are embedded, but often not apparent, within position specific conservation patterns. We find not only that conformational dynamics play a major role, but that they are the dominant contribution to substrate selectivity. In fact, the main substrate classifier distinguishing selectivity is the magnitude of change in compaction of the disordered chain upon phosphorylation. Thus, in addition to providing fundamental insights into the underlying mechanistic consequences of phosphorylation across the entire proteome, our approach provides a novel statistical thermodynamic strategy for partitioning any sequence-based search into contributions from direct chemical and structural complementarity and those from changes in conformational dynamics.

Histopathological analyses of skin biopsies from humans and non-human primates (NHPs) with measles rash have identified MV-infected keratinocytes and mononuclear cells in the epidermis, around hair follicles and near sebaceous glands. Here, we address the pathogenesis of measles skin rash by combining data from experimentally infected NHPs, ex vivo infection of human skin sheets and in vitro infection of primary human keratinocytes. Longitudinal analysis of the skin of experimentally MV-infected NHPs demonstrated that infection in the skin precedes onset of rash by several days. MV infection was initiated in lymphoid and myeloid cells in the dermis before dissemination to the epidermal keratinocytes. These data were in good concordance with ex vivo MV infections of human skin sheets, in which dermal cells were more targeted than the epidermal ones. To address viral dissemination to the epidermis and to determine whether the dissemination is receptor-dependent, we performed experimental infections of primary keratinocytes collected from healthy or nectin-4-deficient donors. These experiments demonstrated that MV infection of keratinocytes is nectin-4-dependent, and nectin-4 expression was higher in differentiated than in proliferating keratinocytes. Based on these data, we hypothesise that measles skin rash is initiated by migrating MV-infected lymphocytes that infect dermal skin-resident CD150+ immune cells. The infection is subsequently disseminated from the dermal papillae to nectin-4+ keratinocytes in the basal epidermis. Lateral spread of MV infection is observed in the superficial epidermis, most likely due to the higher level of nectin-4 expression on differentiated keratinocytes. Finally, MV-infected cells are cleared by infiltrating immune cells, causing hyperaemia and oedema, which give the appearance of morbilliform skin rash.

Author SummarySeveral viral infections are associated with skin rash, including parvovirus B19, human herpesvirus type 6, dengue virus and rubella virus. However, the archetype virus infection that leads to skin rash is measles. Although all of these viral exanthemata often appear similar, their pathogenesis is different. In the case of measles, the appearance of skin rash is a sign that the immune system is clearing MV-infected cells from the skin. How the virus reaches the skin and is locally disseminated remains unknown. Here we combine observations and expertise from pathologists, dermatologists, virologists and immunologists to delineate the pathogenesis of measles skin rash. We show that MV infection of dermal myeloid and lymphoid cells precedes viral dissemination to the epidermal keratinocytes. We speculate that immune-mediated clearance of these infected cells results in hyperaemia and oedema, explaining the redness of the skin and the slightly elevated spots of the morbilliform rash.",1,688,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/867531v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/867531v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_867531.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

We examined the impact on the wheat-Zymoseptoria tritici interaction of altering optimal moisture conditions conducive to infection. We assessed the responses in planta of 48 Z. tritici strains collected in two climatologically distinct locations (Ireland and Israel) to four high moisture regimes differing in the timing and the duration of uninterrupted exposure to saturated relative humidity (100% RH) during the first three days of infection. Individual- and population-level moisture reaction norms expressing how the sporulating area of a lesion change with the RH conditions were established based on visual assessments of lesion development at 14, 17 and 20 days post-inoculation (dpi).

Here, we report genetic, epigenetic and functional evidence to support the tumor suppressor role for PPAR{gamma} in basal bladder tumors. We identified hemizygous deletions, DNA hyper-methylation and loss-of-function mutations of PPAR{gamma} in basal MIBC, associated with PPAR{gamma} under-expression and its decreased activity. Re-expression of PPAR{gamma} in basal tumor cells resulted in the activation of PPAR{gamma} -dependent transcription program that modulated fatty acid metabolism and cell differentiation and decreased cell growth, which could partly rely on EGFR down-regulation. Structure-function studies of two PPAR{gamma} mutant revealed a destabilization of a region important for coactivator recruitment and should help develop potent molecules to activate PPAR{gamma} as a therapeutic strategy for basal MIBC.

We characterise this process in mutagen-induced mouse liver tumours and show that DNA replication across persisting lesions can generate multiple alternative alleles in successive cell divisions, thereby increasing both multi-allelic and combinatorial genetic diversity. The phasing of lesions enables the accurate measurement of strand biased repair processes, the quantification of oncogenic selection, and the fine mapping of sister chromatid exchange events.

This fluctuation-dependent coexistence mechanism requires three conditions: (i) a positive covariance between environment conditions and the strength of competition, (ii) species-specific environmental responses, and (iii) species are less sensitive to competition in environmentally unfavorable years. In serially uncorrelated environments, condition (i) only occurs if favorable environmental conditions immediately and directly increase the strength of competition. For many demographic parameters, this direct link between favorable years and competition may not exist. Moreover, many environmental variables are temporal autocorrelated, but theory has largely focused on serially uncorrelated environments. To address this gap, a model of competing species in autocorrelated environments is analyzed. This analysis shows that positive autocorrelations in demographic rates that increase fitness (e.g. maximal fecundity or adult survival) produce the positive environment-competition covariance. Hence, when these demographic rates contribute to buffered population growth, positive temporal autocorrelations generate a storage effect, otherwise they destabilize competitive interactions. For negatively autocorrelated environments, this theory highlights an alternative stabilizing mechanism that requires three conditions: (i) a negative environmental-competition covariance, (ii) species-specific environmental responses, and (iii) species are less sensitive to competition in more favorable years. When the conditions for either of these stabilizing mechanisms are violated, temporal autocorrelations can generate stochastic priority effects or hasten competitive exclusion.

How cells regulate COL assembly biomechanically still remains to be well understood.

The results showed that MDCK cells actively recruited COL from the medium and helped assemble the fibers, which in turn facilitated cell branching morphogenesis, both displaying high spatial associations and mutual dependency. Inhibition of cellular contraction force by ROCK and Myosin II inhibitors attenuated but did not block the COL fiber formation, while cell motion showed high consistency with the fiber assembly. Under ROCK or Myosin II inhibition, further analysis indicated high correlation between local cell movement and COL fiber strength as quantified from different regions of the same groups.

To study this phenomenon, we propose a one-dimensional mechanical model of heterogeneous epithelial tissue dynamics that includes cell-length-dependent proliferation and death mechanisms. Proliferation and death are incorporated into the discrete model stochastically and arise as source/sink terms in the corresponding continuum model that we derive. Using the new discrete model and continuum description, we explore several applications including the evolution of homogeneous tissues experiencing proliferation and death, and competition in a heterogeneous setting with a cancerous tissue competing for space with an adjacent normal tissue. This framework allows us to postulate new mechanisms that explain the ability of cancer cells to outcompete healthy cells through mechanical differences rather than by having some intrinsic proliferative advantage.

In all domains of life, DSBs are faithfully fixed via homologous recombination. Recombination requires the presence of an uncut copy of duplex DNA that is used as a template for repair. Alternatively, in the absence of a template, cells utilize error-prone Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Although ubiquitously found in eukaryotes, NHEJ is not universally present in bacteria. It is unclear as to why many prokaryotes lack this pathway. To understand what could have led to the current distribution of bacterial NHEJ, we carried out comparative genomics and phylogenetic analysis across ~6000 genomes. Our results show that this pathway is sporadically distributed across the phylogeny. Ancestral reconstruction further suggests that NHEJ was absent in the eubacterial ancestor, and can be acquired via specific routes. Integrating NHEJ occurrence data for archaea, we also find evidence for extensive horizontal exchange of NHEJ genes between the two kingdoms as well as across bacterial clades. The pattern of occurrence in bacteria is consistent with correlated evolution of NHEJ with key genome characteristics of genome size and growth rates; NHEJ presence is associated with large genome sizes and/or slow growth rates, with the former being the dominant correlate. Given the central role these traits play in determining the ability to carry out recombination, it is possible that the evolutionary history of bacterial NHEJ may have been shaped by requirement for efficient DSB repair.",1,771,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/869602v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/869602v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_869602.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

It is known for a long time that SB is driven by glutamatergic neurotransmissions but its underlying mechanism is still unclear. Recent studies show that local glutamate recycle by astrocytes can affect neuronal activities nearby. Since SB is independent of network structure, it is conceivable that the local dynamics might also be the origin of SB in networks. We investigated the effects of local glutamate dynamics on SBs in both cultures developed on multi-electrode array (MEA) systems and a tripartite synapse simulation model. In our experiments, local glutamate recycle dynamics are studied by pharmacologically targeting the astrocytic glutamate transporters (GLT-1), while neuronal firing activities and synaptic glutamate level are simultaneously monitored with MEA and glutamate sensor (iGluSnFR) expressed on surface of astrocytes respectively. We found SBs to be synchronized with glutamate transients and the manipulation of local glutamate dynamics can indeed alter the global properties of the SBs. Detailed simulation of a network with astrocytic glutamate uptake and recycle mechanisms conforming with the experimental observations revealed that astrocytes function as a slow negative feedback for the neuronal activities in the network. With this model, SB can be understood as the alternation between the positive and negative feedback in the neurons and astrocytes in the network respectively. An understanding of this glutamate trafficking dynamics is of general application to explain disordered phenomena in neuronal systems, and therefore can provide new insights into the origin of fatal seizure-like behavior.

SignificanceSynchronous bursting (SB) is a hallmark of neuronal circuits. Contrary to the common belief that the SB is governed mainly by neuron-neuron interactions, this study shows that SBs are orchestrated through a generic neuron-astrocyte tripartite interactions. These interactions, identified as glutamate uptake and recycle processes in astrocytes, control the excitability of neuronal networks and shape the overall SB patterns. Our simulation results suggest that astrocytes traffic more glutamate than neurons and actively regulating glutamate proceedings around synapses. A bipartite synapse is a good approximation of a tripartite synapse provided that astrocyte-dependent glutamate content is taken into account. Our findings provide key insights into the ubiquity of SB and the origin of fatal seizure-like behavior in brain arising from astrocytic malfunction.",1,380,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/870915v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/870915v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_870915.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA

Exposure of the mantle rocks to seawater leads to their alteration into serpentinites. These aqueous geochemical reactions, collectively known as the process of serpentinization, are exothermic and are associated with the release of hydrogen gas (H2), methane (CH4), and small organic molecules. The biological consequences of this flux of energy and organic compounds from the Atlantis Massif were explored by International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 357, which used seabed drills to collect continuous sequences of shallow (<16 meters below seafloor) marine serpentinites and mafic assemblages. Here, we report the first census of microbial diversity in samples of the drill cores, as measured by environmental 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. The problem of contamination of subsurface samples was a primary concern during all stages of this project, starting from the initial study design, continuing to the collection of samples from the seafloor, handling the samples shipboard and in the lab, preparing the samples for DNA extraction, and analyzing the DNA sequence data. To distinguish endemic microbial taxa of serpentinite subsurface rocks from seawater residents and other potential contaminants, the distributions of individual 16S rRNA gene sequences among all samples were evaluated, taking into consideration both presence/absence as well as relative abundances. Our results highlight a few candidate residents of the shallow serpentinite subsurface, including uncultured representatives of the Thermoplasmata, Acidobacteria, Acidimicrobiia, and Chloroflexi.

ImportanceInternational Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 357: ""Serpentinization and Life"" utilized seabed drills for the first time to collect rocks from the oceanic crust. The recovered rock cores represent the shallow serpentinite subsurface of the Atlantis Massif, where reactions between uplifted mantle rocks and water, collectively known as serpentinization, produce environmental conditions that can stimulate biological activity and are thought to be analogous to environments that were prevalent on the early Earth and perhaps other planets. The methodology and results of this project have implications for life detection experiments, including sample return missions, and provide the first window into the diversity of microbial communities inhabiting subseafloor serpentinites.",1,914,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/870956v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/870956v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_870956.txt,1,"field-specific repository, supplement, data availability statement",1,here we focus only on the dna sequencing results 155  from the 15 samples characterized as serpentinites but the dna sequencing data from all samples are included in our sra bioproject prjna575221.;     data availability 540  all unprocessed dna sequence data are publicly available at the ncbi sra under bioproject prjna575221.   results 135  dna yields from rocks dna was extracted from at least one rock core sample collected from all sites (figure 1 text s1) except m0073 (table 1 data set s1).;     dna yields from serpentinite and non-serpentinite rocks (including  140  metagabbro carbonate sand basalt breccia and metadolerite) were similar (table 1 and data set s2).;     we obtained 27524256 read pairs from the water samples (76 samples of surface shallow and deep including sequencing duplicates) (data set s3) from which we identified 15142 asvs.;     six samples of lab air yielded 66846 read pairs and 293 asvs (data set s4) despite below-detection levels of purified dna.;     the asvs identified as water contaminants and detected in serpentinites are listed in data set s5.;     the da approach results in a final list of 684 asvs putatively considered to be true inhabitants of serpentinites (data set s6) including 20  225  additional asvs compared to the so approach.;     seven of these 20 asvs were present at >100 counts in serpentinite samples and less than a total of 53 counts in all water samples (data set s7).;     for clarity the taxonomic classifications of only the top 50 most abundant asvs are shown and more information about these  235  50 asvs is provided in data set s7.;     the most abundant asv was 245  classified as family thermoplasmatales (phylum euryarchaeota) and has 99% identity to a clone (ncbi accession number: ab825685 data set s7) from a deepsea sediment core in the okinawa trough (46).;     other abundant asvs shown in figure 5 and listed in data set s7 include those classified as acidobacteria actinobacteria betaproteobacteria gemmatimonadetes 280  and ktedonobacteria and these sequences were generally most similar to environmental sequences from soils or freshwater.;     our list of laboratory air taxa (data set s4) may be useful for identifying contaminants in future studies as a  15   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/870956; this version posted december 10 2019.;     m0072 and m0073 (data set s6).;     405 identification of contaminants by taxonomy after removal of dna sequences identified as contaminants from seawater and air the most abundant serpentinite asvs (data set s6) still contained many taxa that seemed unlikely to be true inhabitants of the subseafloor.;     because we are suspicious of these taxa but lack direct experimental evidence of a source other than serpentinites we include these asvs in our final tables but flag them as suspected contaminants (data set s7).;     putative inhabitants of the serpentinite subsurface 435  excluding all air and seawater asvs and ignoring all suspicious taxa leaves us with a few putative inhabitants of subseafloor serpentinites (data set s7).;     (sphingomonas) was included in our final list of candidate serpentinite taxa (data set s7).;     for clarity only the top 50 asvs among all samples (data set s7) are shown here.;     supplemental files  830  data set s1: names and locations of all serpentinite and non-serpentinite rock samples.;     data set s2: dna yield from non-serpentinite rock samples.;     835  data set s3: names and locations of all seawater samples.;     data set s4: list of asvs detected in samples of laboratory air.;     data set s5: list of asvs detected in samples of seawater.;     840 data set s6: final list of 684 asvs in serpentinites determined by the da method.  36   biorxiv preprint doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/870956; this version posted december 10 2019.;     data set s7: top 50 most abundant asvs in serpentinites (according to maximum proportional abundance per sample).   data availability 540  all unprocessed dna sequence data are publicly available at the ncbi sra under bioproject prjna575221,it is made available under acc-by-nc 4.0 international license.  https://github.com/brazelton-lab/atlantis-massif-2015.;     all custom software and scripts are available at https://github.com/brazelton-lab.

Microstructure in temporal [fornix, parahippocampal cingulum, uncinate fasciculus], motor and whole-brain WM was assessed with myelin-sensitive indices from quantitative magnetization transfer [macromolecular proton fraction (MPF)] and axon density from diffusion imaging. Individuals with the highest genetic risk (FH+ and APOE-{varepsilon}4) compared to those with FH+ alone showed obesity-related reductions in MPF and axon density in the right parahippocampal cingulum.

N.",Angela N Brooks,"University of California, Santa Cruz",2019-12-11,1,cc_by,Bioinformatics,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2019/12/11/872028.source.xml,"While advancements in genome sequencing have identified millions of somatic mutations in cancer, their functional impact is poorly understood. We previously developed the expression-based variant impact phenotyping (eVIP) method to use gene expression data to characterize the function of gene variants. The eVIP method uses a decision tree-based algorithm to predict the functional impact of somatic variants by comparing gene expression signatures induced by introduction of wild-type versus mutant cDNAs in cell lines. The method distinguishes between variants that are gain-of-function, loss-of-function, change-of-function, or neutral. We present eVIP2, software that allows for pathway analysis (eVIP Pathways) and usage with RNA-seq data. To demonstrate the eVIP2 software and approach, we characterized two recurrent frameshift variants in RNF43, a negative regulator of Wnt signaling, frequently mutated in colorectal, gastric and endometrial cancer. RNF43 WT, RNF43 R117fs, RNF43 G659fs, or GFP control cDNA were overexpressed in HEK293T cells. Analysis with eVIP2 predicted that the frameshift at position 117 was a loss-of-function mutation, as expected. The second frameshift at position 659, was, surprisingly, predicted to be a gain-of-function mutation. Additional eVIP Pathways analysis of RNF43 G659fs predicted 10 pathways to be significantly altered, including TNF alpha via NFKB signaling, KRAS signaling, and hypoxia. To validate these predictions, we performed reporter assays and found that all eVIP2 impactful pathways tested in the assay were activated by expression of RNF43 G659fs, but not by expression of RNF43 WT, supporting that RNF43 G659fs is a gain-of-function mutation and its effect on the identified pathways. The eVIP2 method is an important step towards overcoming the current challenge of variant interpretation in the implementation of precision medicine. eVIP2 is available at https://github.com/BrooksLabUCSC/eVIP2.",0,366,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/872028v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/872028v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_872028.txt,1,general-purpose repository,1,the software instruction manual tutorial and example data are available on github (https://github.com/brookslabucsc/evip2).,it is made available under acc-by 4.0 international license.  implementation  of  precision  medicine.  evip2  is  available  at  https://github.com/brookslabucsc/evip2.;     the software instruction manual tutorial and example data are available on github (https://github.com/brookslabucsc/evip2).

CaiNet automatically compiles a network laid out in a graphical user interface into a fast hybrid stochastic-deterministic simulation framework without further mathematical knowledge or input by the user. Stochastic noise can optionally be omitted for simplified deterministic solutions. We validate CaiNet by comparison with Gillespie simulations using an auto feedback motive. We apply CaiNet to the circadian clock and find that temporally modulated external input signals allow regulating the periodicity of oscillations in a nested network topology.

One particular adhesin, Epithelial Adhesin 1 [Epa1p], is responsible for binding to host tissue, a process which is essential for fungal propagation. Epa1p structure consists of three domains: an N-terminal intercellular binding domain responsible for epithelial cell binding, a C-terminal GPI anchor for cell wall linkage, and a serine / threonine-rich linker domain connecting these terminal domains. The linker domain contains a 40-amino acid tandem repeat region, which we have found to be variable in repeat copy number between isolates from clinical sources. We hypothesized that natural variation in Epa1p repeat copy may modulate protein function. To test this, we recombinantly expressed Epa1p with various repeat copy numbers in S. cerevisiae to determine how differences in repeat copy number affect Epa1p expression, surface display, and binding to human epithelial cells. Our data suggest that repeat copy number variation has pleiotropic effects, influencing gene expression, protein surface display, shedding from the cell surface, and host tissue adhesion of the Epa1p adhesin. Understanding these links between repeat copy number variants and mechanisms of infection provide new understanding of the variety of roles of repetitive proteins contribute to pathogenicity of C. glabrata.",1,439,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/872853v1?versioned=TRUE,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/872853v1.full.pdf,_10.1101_872853.txt,0,NA,0,NA,NA
