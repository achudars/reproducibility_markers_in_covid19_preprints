  Adaptive Optics and Digital Phase-Locked Loop","In the framework of optical high data rate satellite-to-ground links, we
investigate the performance of a coherent receiver which combines an adaptive
optics system and a digital carrier synchronization technique. We propose a
digital carrier synchronization system based on a phase-locked loop and use
end-to-end simulations to characterize the impact of the atmospheric turbulence
in the case of a representative low Earth orbit satellite-to-ground
transmission link. The results show that classical digital phase-locked loop
techniques can be a reliable solution to accurately compensate for the Doppler
frequency shift between the incoming signal and the local oscillator at the
ground station, in the presence of a preliminary coarse frequency estimation.
Adaptive optics compensation enables the loop to lock after a few milliseconds
and to accurately track the phase fluctuations. The bit-error-rate performance
is not degraded by the digital loop but suffers from the residual signal
amplitude fluctuations.

  Experiments","The Fermilab Short-Baseline Neutrino (SBN) experiments, MicroBooNE, ICARUS,
and SBND, are expected to have significant sensitivity to light weakly coupled
hidden sector particles. Here we study the capability of the SBN experiments to
probe dark scalars interacting through the Higgs portal. We investigate
production of dark scalars using both the Fermilab Booster 8 GeV and NuMI 120
GeV proton beams, simulating kaons decaying to dark scalars and taking into
account the beamline geometry. We also investigate strategies to mitigate
backgrounds from beam-related neutrino scattering events. We find that SBND,
with its comparatively short ${\cal O}(100\ {\rm m})$ baseline, will have the
best sensitivity to scalars produced with Booster, while ICARUS, with its large
detector volume, will provide the best limits on off-axis dark scalar
production from NuMI. The SBN experiments can provide leading tests of dark
scalars with masses in the 50 - 350 MeV range in the near term. Our results
motivate dedicated experimental searches for dark scalars and other long-lived
hidden sector states at these experiments.

  Identification","The recent emergence of novel computational devices, such as quantum
computers, coherent Ising machines, and digital annealers presents new
opportunities for hardware-accelerated hybrid optimization algorithms.
Unfortunately, demonstrations of unquestionable performance gains leveraging
novel hardware platforms have faced significant obstacles. One key challenge is
understanding the algorithmic properties that distinguish such devices from
established optimization approaches. Through the careful design of contrived
optimization tasks, this work provides new insights into the computation
properties of quantum annealing and suggests that this model has the potential
to quickly identify the structure of high-quality solutions. A meticulous
comparison to a variety of algorithms spanning both complete and local search
suggests that quantum annealing's performance on the proposed optimization
tasks is distinct. This result provides new insights into the time scales and
types of optimization problems where quantum annealing has the potential to
provide notable performance gains over established optimization algorithms and
suggests the development of hybrid algorithms that combine the best features of

  observations","Most time-series models assume that the data come from observations that are
equally spaced in time. However, this assumption does not hold in many diverse
scientific fields, such as astronomy, finance, and climatology, among others.
There are some techniques that fit unequally spaced time series, such as the
continuous-time autoregressive moving average (CARMA) processes. These models
are defined as the solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is not
uncommon in astronomical time series, that the time gaps between observations
are large. Therefore, an alternative suitable approach to modeling astronomical
time series with large gaps between observations should be based on the
solution of a difference equation of a discrete process. In this work we
propose a novel model to fit irregular time series called the complex irregular
autoregressive (CIAR) model that is represented directly as a discrete-time
process. We show that the model is weakly stationary and that it can be
represented as a state-space system, allowing efficient maximum likelihood
estimation based on the Kalman recursions. Furthermore, we show via Monte Carlo
simulations that the finite sample performance of the parameter estimation is
accurate. The proposed methodology is applied to light curves from periodic
variable stars, illustrating how the model can be implemented to detect poor
adjustment of the harmonic model. This can occur when the period has not been
accurately estimated or when the variable stars are multiperiodic. Last, we
show how the CIAR model, through its state space representation, allows
unobserved measurements to be forecast.

challenging. In this paper, we propose an end-to-end deep learning technique to
design a structured CS matrix that is well suited to the underlying channel
distribution, leveraging both sparsity and the particular spatial structure
that appears in vehicular channels. The channel measurements acquired with the
designed CS matrix are then used to predict the best beam for link
configuration. Simulation results for vehicular communication channels indicate
that our deep learning-based approach achieves better beam alignment than
standard CS techniques that use the random phase shift-based design.

longitudinal polarization of gauge bosons can be naturally identified as
mixture of the goldstone component and a remnant gauge component that vanishes
at the limit of zero mass, making the goldstone equivalence manifest. In light
of this observation, we re-examine the Feynman rules of massive gauge theory by
treating gauge fields and their corresponding goldstone fields as single
objects, writing them uniformly as 5-component ""vector"" fields. The gauge group
is taken to be $SU(2)_L$ to preserve custodial symmetry. We find the derivation
of gauge-goldstone propagators becomes rather trivial by noticing there is a
remarkable parallel between massless gauge theory and massive gauge theory in
this notation. We also derive the Feynman rules of all vertices, finding the
vertex for self-interactions of vector (gauge-goldstone) bosons are especially
simplified. We then demonstrate that the new form of the longitudinal
polarization vector and the standard form give the same results for all the
3-point on-shell amplitudes. This on-shell matching confirms similar results
obtained with on-shell approach for massive scattering amplitudes by
Arkani-Hamed et.al. Finally we calculate some $1\rightarrow 2$ collinear
splitting amplitudes by making use of the new Feynman rules and the on-shell
match condition.

demanding an efficient compiler that can shield the diversity in both software

deep learning compilers, TVM is well known for its efficiency in code
generation and optimization across diverse hardware devices. In the meanwhile,
the Sunway many-core processor renders itself as a competitive candidate for
its attractive computational power in both scientific and deep learning
applications. This paper combines the trends in these two directions.
Specifically, we propose swTVM that extends the original TVM to support
ahead-of-time compilation for architecture requiring cross-compilation such as
Sunway. In addition, we leverage the architecture features during the
compilation such as core group for massive parallelism, DMA for high bandwidth
memory transfer and local device memory for data locality, in order to generate

results show the ability of swTVM to automatically generate code for various

  ocean-atmosphere systems -- Impact of the ocean basin boundary conditions","The predictability of the atmosphere at short and long time scales,
associated with the coupling to the ocean, is explored in a new version of the
Modular Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model (MAOOAM), based on a 2-layer
quasi-geostrophic atmosphere and a 1-layer reduced-gravity quasi-geostrophic
ocean. This version features a new ocean basin geometry with periodic boundary
conditions in the zonal direction. The analysis presented in this paper
considers a low-order version of the model with 40 dynamical variables.
  First the increase of surface friction (and the associated heat flux) with
the ocean can either induce chaos when the aspect ratio between the meridional
and zonal directions of the domain of integration is small, or suppress chaos
when it is large. This reflects the potentially counter-intuitive role that the
ocean can play in the coupled dynamics.
  Second, and perhaps more importantly, the emergence of long-term
predictability within the atmosphere for specific values of the friction
coefficient occurs through intermittent excursions in the vicinity of a
(long-period) unstable periodic solution. Once close to this solution the
system is predictable for long times, i.e. a few years. The intermittent
transition close to this orbit is, however, erratic and probably hard to
predict.
  This new route to long-term predictability contrasts with the one found in
the closed ocean-basin low-order version of MAOOAM, in which the chaotic
solution is permanently wandering in the vicinity of an unstable periodic orbit
for specific values of the friction coefficient. The model solution is thus at
any time influenced by the unstable periodic orbit and inherits from its
long-term predictability.

two hydrophilic stripes is studied experimentally and numerically using direct
numerical simulations. The capillary bridge is formed from an evaporating water
droplet wetting three neighboring stripes of a chemically patterned surface. By
considering the breakup process in a phase space representation, the breakup
dynamics can be evaluated without the uncertainty in determining the precise
breakup time. The simulations are based on the Volume-of-Fluid (VOF) method
implemented in Free Surface 3D (FS3D). In order to construct physically
realistic initial data for the VOF simulation, Surface Evolver is employed to
calculate an initial configuration consistent with experiments. Numerical
instabilities at the contact line are reduced by a novel discretization of the
Navier-slip boundary condition on staggered grids. The breakup of the capillary
bridge cannot be characterized by a unique scaling relationship. Instead, at
different stages of the breakup process different scaling exponents apply, and
the structure of the bridge undergoes a qualitative change. In the final stage

the spectral lines of the Mira star $\chi$ Cyg, we derive information about the
dynamics of the stellar photosphere, including pulsation.
  Methods: From spectropolarimetric observations of $\chi$ Cyg, we perform
careful analysis of the polarisation signals observed in atomic and molecular
lines, both in absorption and emission, using the radiative transfer in the
polarisation context, through two mechanisms: intrinsic polarisation and
continuum depolarisation. We also explain the observed line doubling phenomenon
in terms of an expanding shell in spherical geometry, which allows us to
pinpoint the coordinates over the stellar disk with enhanced polarisation.
  Results: We find that the polarised spectrum of $\chi$ Cyg is dominated by
intrinsic polarisation, with a negligible continuum depolarisation.
  The observed polarised signals can only be explained by assuming that this
polarisation is locally enhanced by velocity fields.
  During the pulsation, radial velocities are not homogeneous over the disk.
  We map these regions of enhanced velocities.
  Conclusions: We have set an algorithm to distinguish in any stellar spectra
of linear polarisation the origin of this polarisation and the way to increase
signal by coherently adding many lines with an appropriated weight. Applied to
the Mira star $\chi$ Cyg, we reached the unexpected result that during the
pulsation, velocities are radial but not homogeneous over the disk. The reason
for these local velocity enhancements are probably related to the interplay
between the atmospheric pulsation dynamics and the underlying stellar
convection.

remarkable ability to automate many routine tasks when presented with
sufficient data for training. The neural network architecture (e.g. number of
layers, types of layers, connections between layers, etc.) plays a critical
role in determining what, if anything, the neural network is able to learn from
the training data. The trend for neural network architectures, especially those
trained on ImageNet, has been to grow ever deeper and more complex. The result
has been ever increasing accuracy on benchmark datasets with the cost of
increased computational demands. In this paper we demonstrate that neural
network architectures can be automatically generated, tailored for a specific
application, with dual objectives: accuracy of prediction and speed of
prediction. Using MENNDL--an HPC-enabled software stack for neural architecture
search--we generate a neural network with comparable accuracy to
state-of-the-art networks on a cancer pathology dataset that is also $16\times$
faster at inference. The speedup in inference is necessary because of the
volume and velocity of cancer pathology data; specifically, the previous
state-of-the-art networks are too slow for individual researchers without
access to HPC systems to keep pace with the rate of data generation. Our new
model enables researchers with modest computational resources to analyze newly
generated data faster than it is collected.

the distribution of a sequence of independent data taking values in a general
metric space, where change-points are viewed as locations at which the
distribution of the data sequence changes abruptly in terms of either its
Fr\'echet mean or Fr\'echet variance or both. The proposed method is based on
comparisons of Fr\'echet variances before and after putative change-point
locations and does not require a tuning parameter except for the specification
of cut-off intervals near the endpoints where change-points are assumed not to
occur. Our results include theoretical guarantees for consistency of the test
under contiguous alternatives when a change-point exists and also for
consistency of the estimated location of the change-point if it exists, where
under the null hypothesis of no change-point the limit distribution of the
proposed scan function is the square of a standardized Brownian Bridge. These
consistency results are applicable for a broad class of metric spaces under
mild entropy conditions. Examples include the space of univariate probability
distributions and the space of graph Laplacians for networks. Simulation
studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, both for
inferring the presence of a change-point and estimating its location. We also
develop theory that justifies bootstrap-based inference and illustrate the new
approach with sequences of maternal fertility distributions and communication
networks.

  Thermal Platforms in Laminar Flow Regime","Recent success in synthesizing thermally stable nanofluids at low costs is a
significant breakthrough in the evolution of volumetric absorption based solar
thermal systems. However, we have yet not been able to clearly identify the
range of operating and design parameters in which volumetric absorption could
prove to be beneficial. One of the key reasons being that we have not been able
to fully understand the heat transfer mechanisms involved in these novel
systems. The present work takes a few steps further in this direction wherein
we have developed a comprehensive and mechanistic theoretical framework which
is robust enough to account for coupled transport phenomena and orders of
magnitudes of operating parameters for host of receiver design configurations.
Moreover, we have also modeled equivalent surface absorption based systems to
provide a comparison between volumetric and surface absorption processes under
similar operating conditions. Performance characteristics reveal that
particularly at high solar concentration ratios, volumetric absorption-based
receivers could have 35% - 49% higher thermal efficiencies compared to their
surface absorption-based counterparts. Finally, the present work serves to
define optimal performance domains of these solar thermal systems, particularly
in the laminar flow regime (200 < Re < 1600) and over a wide range of solar
concentration ratios (5-100) and inlet fluid temperatures (293-593K).

  Observations of Turbulent MHD Simulations","In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the Faraday depth (FD)
spectrum and its clean components obtained through the application of the
commonly used technique of Faraday rotation measure synthesis to analyze
spectro-polarimetric data. In order to directly compare the Faraday depth
spectrum with physical properties of a magneto-ionic medium, we generated
synthetic broad-bandwidth spectro-polarimetric observations from
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a transonic, isothermal, compressible
turbulent medium. We find that correlated magnetic field structures give rise
to a combination of spiky, localized peaks at certain FD values, and broad
structures in the FD spectrum. Although the majority of these spiky FD
structures appear narrow, giving an impression of a Faraday thin medium, we
show that they arise from strong synchrotron emissivity at that FD. Strong
emissivity at a FD can arise because of both strong spatially-local polarized
synchrotron emissivity at a FD or accumulation of weaker emissions along the
distance through a medium that have Faraday depths within half the width of the
rotation measure spread function. Such a complex Faraday depth spectrum is a
natural consequence of MHD turbulence when the lines of sight pass through a
few turbulent cells. This therefore complicates the convention of attributing
narrow FD peaks to presence of a Faraday rotating medium along the line of
sight. Our work shows that it is difficult to extract the FD along a line of
sight from the Faraday depth spectrum using standard methods for a turbulent
medium in which synchrotron emission and Faraday rotation occur simultaneously.

  detected at very high energies with the MAGIC telescopes","Extreme high-energy peaked BL Lac objects (EHBLs) are an emerging class of
blazars. Their typical two-hump structured spectral energy distribution (SED)
peaks at higher energies with respect to conventional blazars. Multi-wavelength
(MWL) observations constrain their synchrotron peak in the medium to hard X-ray
band. Their gamma-ray SED peaks above the GeV band, and in some objects it
extends up to several TeV. Up to now, only a few EHBLs have been detected in
the TeV gamma-ray range. In this paper, we report the detection of the EHBL
2WHSP J073326.7+515354, observed and detected during 2018 in TeV gamma rays
with the MAGIC telescopes. The broad-band SED is studied within a MWL context,
including an analysis of the Fermi-LAT data over ten years of observation and
with simultaneous Swift-XRT, Swift-UVOT, and KVA data. Our analysis results in
a set of spectral parameters that confirms the classification of the source as
an EHBL. In order to investigate the physical nature of this extreme emission,
different theoretical frameworks were tested to model the broad-band SED. The
hard TeV spectrum of 2WHSP J073326.7+515354 sets the SED far from the energy
equipartition regime in the standard one-zone leptonic scenario of blazar
emission. Conversely, more complex models of the jet, represented by either a
two-zone spine-layer model or a hadronic emission model, better represent the
broad-band SED.

  of scientific fission and ambidextrous scientific drivers","One of the fundamental questions in science is how scientific disciplines
evolve and sustain progress in society. No studies to date allows us to explain
the endogenous processes that support the evolution of scientific disciplines
and emergence of new scientific fields in applied sciences of physics. This
study confronts this problem here by investigating the evolution of
experimental physics to explain and generalize some characteristics of the
dynamics of applied sciences. Empirical analysis suggests properties about the
evolution of experimental physics and in general of applied sciences, such as:
a) scientific fission, the evolution of scientific disciplines generates a
process of division into two or more research fields that evolve as autonomous
entities over time; b) ambidextrous drivers of science, the evolution of
science via scientific fission is due to scientific discoveries or new
technologies; c) new driving research fields, the drivers of scientific
disciplines are new research fields rather than old ones; d) science driven by
development of general purpose technologies, the evolution of experimental
physics and applied sciences is due to the convergence of experimental and
theoretical branches of physics associated with the development of computer,
information systems and applied computational science. Results also reveal that
average duration of the upwave of scientific production in scientific fields
supporting experimental physics is about 80 years. Overall, then, this study
begins the process of clarifying and generalizing, as far as possible, some
characteristics of the evolutionary dynamics of scientific disciplines that can
lay a foundation for the development of comprehensive properties explaining the
evolution of science as a whole for supporting fruitful research policy

models are crucial to gain user trust. Prior works that have focused on paths
connecting users and items in a heterogeneous network have several limitations,
such as discovering relationships rather than true explanations, or
disregarding other users' privacy. In this work, we take a fresh perspective,
and present PRINCE: a provider-side mechanism to produce tangible explanations
for end-users, where an explanation is defined to be a set of minimal actions
performed by the user that, if removed, changes the recommendation to a
different item. Given a recommendation, PRINCE uses a polynomial-time optimal
algorithm for finding this minimal set of a user's actions from an exponential
search space, based on random walks over dynamic graphs. Experiments on two
real-world datasets show that PRINCE provides more compact explanations than
intuitive baselines, and insights from a crowdsourced user-study demonstrate
the viability of such action-based explanations. We thus posit that PRINCE
produces scrutable, actionable, and concise explanations, owing to its use of
counterfactual evidence, a user's own actions, and minimal sets, respectively.

the choice of hyperparameters. Their tuning is notoriously expensive, typically
requiring an iterative training process to run for numerous steps to
convergence. Traditional tuning algorithms only consider the final performance
of hyperparameters acquired after many expensive iterations and ignore
intermediate information from earlier training steps. In this paper, we present
a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach which exploits the iterative structure of
learning algorithms for efficient hyperparameter tuning. We propose to learn an
evaluation function compressing learning progress at any stage of the training
process into a single numeric score according to both training success and
stability. Our BO framework is then balancing the benefit of assessing a
hyperparameter setting over additional training steps against their computation
cost. We further increase model efficiency by selectively including scores from
different training steps for any evaluated hyperparameter set. We demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithm by tuning hyperparameters for the training of
deep reinforcement learning agents and convolutional neural networks. Our
algorithm outperforms all existing baselines in identifying optimal
hyperparameters in minimal time.

  Pre-Trained Language Models","Modern text-to-speech (TTS) systems are able to generate audio that sounds
almost as natural as human speech. However, the bar of developing high-quality
TTS systems remains high since a sizable set of studio-quality <text, audio>
pairs is usually required. Compared to commercial data used to develop
state-of-the-art systems, publicly available data are usually worse in terms of
both quality and size. Audio generated by TTS systems trained on publicly
available data tends to not only sound less natural, but also exhibits more
background noise. In this work, we aim to lower TTS systems' reliance on
high-quality data by providing them the textual knowledge extracted by deep
pre-trained language models during training. In particular, we investigate the
use of BERT to assist the training of Tacotron-2, a state of the art TTS
consisting of an encoder and an attention-based decoder. BERT representations
learned from large amounts of unlabeled text data are shown to contain very
rich semantic and syntactic information about the input text, and have
potential to be leveraged by a TTS system to compensate the lack of
high-quality data. We incorporate BERT as a parallel branch to the Tacotron-2
encoder with its own attention head. For an input text, it is simultaneously
passed into BERT and the Tacotron-2 encoder. The representations extracted by
the two branches are concatenated and then fed to the decoder. As a preliminary
study, although we have not found incorporating BERT into Tacotron-2 generates
more natural or cleaner speech at a human-perceivable level, we observe
improvements in other aspects such as the model is being significantly better
at knowing when to stop decoding such that there is much less babbling at the
end of the synthesized audio and faster convergence during training.

the ability to almost immediately output a nontrivial lower bound to the

  to Byzantine Attacks","This paper deals with distributed finite-sum optimization for learning over
networks in the presence of malicious Byzantine attacks. To cope with such
attacks, most resilient approaches so far combine stochastic gradient descent
(SGD) with different robust aggregation rules. However, the sizeable
SGD-induced stochastic gradient noise makes it challenging to distinguish
malicious messages sent by the Byzantine attackers from noisy stochastic
gradients sent by the 'honest' workers. This motivates us to reduce the
variance of stochastic gradients as a means of robustifying SGD in the presence
of Byzantine attacks. To this end, the present work puts forth a Byzantine
attack resilient distributed (Byrd-) SAGA approach for learning tasks involving
finite-sum optimization over networks. Rather than the mean employed by
distributed SAGA, the novel Byrd- SAGA relies on the geometric median to
aggregate the corrected stochastic gradients sent by the workers. When less

(ii) cyberinfrastructure requirements to numerically simulate astrophysical
sources, and to process and interpret Multi-Messenger Astrophysics data; (iii)
management of gravitational wave detections and triggers to enable
electromagnetic and astro-particle follow-ups; (iv) a vision to harness future
developments of machine and deep learning and cyberinfrastructure resources to
cope with the scale of discovery in the Big Data Era; (v) and the need to build

exhibit rotationally modulated stellar activity from spots and plages. It is
advantageous to observe these stars at near infrared (NIR) wavelengths (1-2.5
microns) where they emit the bulk of their bolometric luminosity and are most
quiescent. In this work we describe our methodology and results in obtaining
precise radial velocity (RV) measurements of low mass stars using K-band
spectra taken with the R~80,000 iSHELL spectrograph and the NASA Infrared
Telescope Facility (IRTF) using a methane isotopologue gas cell in the
calibration unit. Our novel analysis pipeline extracts RVs by minimizing the
RMS of the residuals between the observed spectrum and a forward model. The
model accounts for the gas cell, tellurics, blaze function, multiple sources of
quasi-sinusoidal fringing, and line spread function of the spectrograph (LSF).
The stellar template is derived iteratively using the target observations
themselves through averaging barycenter-shifted residuals. We have demonstrated
5 ms^-1 precision over one year timescales for the M4 dwarf Barnard's Star and
K dwarf 61 Cygni A, and 3 ms^-1 over a month for the M2 dwarf GJ 15 A. This
work demonstrates the potential for iSHELL to determine dynamical masses for
candidate exoplanets discovered with the NASA TESS mission, and to search for
exoplanets orbiting moderately active and/or young K and M dwarfs.

movements to accomplish a given shared task. Lifting an object together, sawing
a wood log, transferring objects from a point to another are all examples where
motor coordination between humans and machines is a crucial requirement. While
the dyadic coordination between a human and a robot has been studied in
previous investigations, the multi-agent scenario in which a robot has to be
integrated into a human group still remains a less explored field of research.
In this paper we discuss how to synthesise an artificial agent able to
coordinate its motion in human ensembles. Driven by a control architecture
based on deep reinforcement learning, such an artificial agent will be able to
autonomously move itself in order to synchronise its motion with that of the
group while exhibiting human-like kinematic features. As a paradigmatic
coordination task we take a group version of the so-called mirror-game which is
highlighted as a good benchmark in the human movement literature.

  Quasi-2D Itinerant-Electron Paramagnets, Ferromagnets and Antiferromagnets","We develop a comprehensive theory for magnetoelectricity in magnetically
ordered quasi-2D systems whereby in thermal equilibrium an electric field can
induce a magnetization $m$ and a magnetic field can induce a polarization. This
effect requires that both space-inversion and time-reversal symmetry are
broken. Antiferromagnetic (AFM) order plays a central role in this theory. We
define a N\'eel operator $\tau$ such that a nonzero expectation value $\langle
\tau \rangle$ signals AFM order, in the same way $m$ signals ferromagnetic (FM)
order. While $m$ is even under space inversion and odd under time reversal,
$\tau$ describes a toroidal moment that is odd under both symmetries. Thus $m$
and $\langle \tau \rangle$ quantify complementary aspects of magnetic order in
solids. In quasi-2D systems FM order can be attributed to dipolar equilibrium
currents that give rise to $m$. In the same way, AFM order arises from
quadrupolar currents that generate the moment $\langle \tau \rangle$. The
electric-field-induced magnetization can then be attributed to the electric
manipulation of the quadrupolar currents. We develop a $k \cdot p$
envelope-function theory for AFM diamond structures that allows us to derive
explicit expressions for the operator $\tau$. Considering FM zincblende and AFM
diamond, we derive quantitative expressions for the magnetoelectric responses
due to electric and magnetic fields that reveal explicitly the inherent duality
of these responses required by thermodynamics. Magnetoelectricity is found to
be small in realistic calculations for quasi-2D electron systems. The
magnetoelectric response of quasi-2D hole systems turns out to be sizable,
however, with moderate electric fields being able to induce a magnetic moment
of one Bohr magneton per charge carrier. Our theory provides a broad framework
for the manipulation of magnetic order by means of external fields.

us to derive optimal importance sampling schemes to reduce LR gradient
variance. Our newly derived distributions have analytic probability densities

distributions was modest, but for other distributions such as a Beta
distribution, our method could lead to arbitrarily large improvements, and was
crucial to obtain competitive performance in evolution strategies experiments.

transients raising unprecedented data challenges in the process. Only the use
of the machine learning algorithms can process such large data volumes. Most of
the discovered transients will belong to the known classes of astronomical
objects. However, it is expected that some transients will be rare or
completely new events of unknown physical nature. The task of finding them can
be framed as an anomaly detection problem. In this work, we perform for the
first time an automated anomaly detection analysis in the photometric data of
the Open Supernova Catalog (OSC), which serves as a proof of concept for the
applicability of these methods to future large scale surveys. The analysis
consists of the following steps: 1) data selection from the OSC and
approximation of the pre-processed data with Gaussian processes, 2)
dimensionality reduction, 3) searching for outliers with the use of the
isolation forest algorithm, 4) expert analysis of the identified outliers. The
pipeline returned 81 candidate anomalies, 27 (33%) of which were confirmed to
be from astrophysically peculiar objects. Found anomalies correspond to a
selected sample of 1.4% of the initial automatically identified data sample of
~2000 objects. Among the identified outliers we recognised superluminous
supernovae, non-classical Type Ia supernovae, unusual Type II supernovae, one
active galactic nucleus and one binary microlensing event. We also found that
16 anomalies classified as supernovae in the literature are likely to be
quasars or stars. Our proposed pipeline represents an effective strategy to
guarantee we shall not overlook exciting new science hidden in the data we
fought so hard to acquire. All code and products of this investigation are made

multiprover interactive proof systems, in which the provers do not share
entanglement, was characterized in a famous work by Babai, Fortnow, and Lund
(Computational Complexity 1991), whose main result was the equality MIP = NEXP.
The power of quantum multiprover interactive proof systems, in which the
provers are allowed to share entanglement, has proven to be much more difficult
to characterize. The best known lower-bound on MIP* is NEXP, due to Ito and
Vidick (FOCS 2012). As for upper bounds, MIP* could be as large as RE, the
class of recursively enumerable languages.
  The main result of this work is the inclusion of NEEXP (nondeterministic
doubly exponential time) in MIP*. This is an exponential improvement over the
prior lower bound and shows that proof systems with entangled provers are at
least exponentially more powerful than classical provers. In our protocol the
verifier delegates a classical, exponentially large MIP protocol for NEEXP to
two entangled provers: the provers obtain their exponentially large questions
by measuring their shared state, and use a classical PCP to certify the
correctness of their exponentially-long answers. For the soundness of our
protocol, it is crucial that each player should not only sample its own
question correctly but also avoid performing measurements that would reveal the
other player's sampled question. We ensure this by commanding the players to
perform a complementary measurement, relying on the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle to prevent the forbidden measurements from being performed.

characterizations of the oxide/semiconductor interface in MOS capacitors with a
SiO2 layer deposited on 4H-SiC using dichlorosilane and nitrogen-based vapor
precursors. The capacitors, subjected to a standard post deposition annealing
process in N2O, exhibited an interface state density Dit = 9.0 x 1011cm-2eV-1
below the conduction band edge. At room temperature, a barrier height
(conduction band offset) of 2.8 eV was observed, along with the presence of
negative charges in the insulator. The SiO2 insulating properties were
evaluated by studying the experimental temperature-dependence of the gate
current. In particular, the temperature-dependent electrical measurements
showed a negative temperature coefficient of the Fowler-Nordheim electron
barrier height (dFB/dT = - 0.98 meV/{\deg}C), which was very close to the
expected value for an ideal SiO2/4H-SiC system and much lower compared to the
values reported for thermally grown SiO2. This smaller dependence of FB on the
temperature and the increase of the current level with temperature in the
transcharacteristics measured in the relative fabricated MOSFETs represents a
clear advantage of our deposited SiO2 for the operation of MOSFET devices at
high temperatures.

observers and inspired people to ponder about their origins. The Desert
Fireball Network (DFN) is the largest single fireball network in the world,
covering about one third of Australian skies. This expansive size has enabled
us to capture a majority of the atmospheric trajectory of a spectacular grazing
event that lasted over90 seconds, penetrated as deep as ~58.5km, and traveled
over 1,300 km through the atmosphere before exiting back into interplanetary
space. Based on our triangulation and dynamic analyses of the event, we have
estimated the initial mass to be at least 60 kg, which would correspond to a30
cm object given a chondritic density (3500 kg m-3). However, this initial mass
estimate is likely a lower bound, considering the minimal deceleration observed
in the luminous phase. The most intriguing quality of this close encounter is
that the meteoroid originated from an Apollo-type orbit and was inserted into a
Jupiter-family comet (JFC) orbit due to the net energy gained during the close
encounter with the Earth. Based on numerical simulations, the meteoroid will
likely spend ~200kyrs on a JFC orbit and have numerous encounters with Jupiter,
the first of which will occur in January-March 2025. Eventually the meteoroid
will likely be ejected from the Solar System or be flung into a trans-Neptunian
orbit.

accretion in their outskirts (beyond 2 effective radii Re) due to dry, minor
galaxy mergers. We use observations of 1010 passive early-type galaxies (ETGs)
within z<0.15 from SDSS IV MaNGA to search for evidence of this accretion. The
outputs from the stellar population fitting codes FIREFLY, pPXF, and Prospector
are compared to control for systematic errors in stellar metallicity (Z)
estimation. We find that the average radial logZ/Zsun profiles of ETGs in
various stellar mass (M) bins are not linear. As a result, these profiles are
poorly characterized by a single gradient value, explaining why weak trends
reported in previous work can be difficult to interpret. Instead, we examine
the full radial extent of stellar metallicity profiles and find them to flatten
in the outskirts of M>10^{11}Msun ETGs. This is a signature of stellar
accretion. Based on a toy model for stellar metallicity profiles, we infer the
ex-situ stellar mass fraction in ETGs as a function of M and galactocentric
radius. We find that ex-situ stars at 2Re make up 20% of the projected stellar
mass of M<10^{10.5}Msun ETGs, rising up to 80% for M>10^{11.5}Msun ETGs.

along this line often exploit item attributes and correlations from different
perspectives, but they yet lack an effective way to combine both types of
information for deep learning of personalized interests. In light of this, we
propose a novel graph structure, \emph{attribute network}, based on both items'
co-purchase network and important attributes. A novel neural model called
\emph{eRAN} is then proposed to generate recommendations from attribute
networks with explainability and cold-start capability. Specifically, eRAN
first maps items connected in attribute networks to low-dimensional embedding
vectors through a deep autoencoder, and then an attention mechanism is applied
to model the attractions of attributes to users, from which personalized item
representation can be derived. Moreover, a pairwise ranking loss is constructed
into eRAN to improve recommendations, with the assumption that item pairs
co-purchased by a user should be more similar than those non-paired with
negative sampling in personalized view. Experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method compared with some state-of-the-art
competitors. In particular, eRAN shows its unique abilities in recommending

biharmonic equation in $n$ space dimensions, with $n \in \{2,\dots,7\}$, whose
generalized solution belongs to the Sobolev space $H^s(\Omega) \cap
H^2_0(\Omega)$, for $\frac{1}{2} \max(5,n) < s \leq 4$, where $\Omega =
(0,1)^n$. The result extends the range of the Sobolev index $s$ in the best
convergence results currently available in the literature to the maximal range
admitted by the Sobolev embedding of $H^s(\Omega)$ into $C(\overline\Omega)$ in
$n$ space dimensions.

the cell coverage as they enable high power transmissions without saturating
the power amplifier. A new modulation scheme, namely, pi/2-BPSK was introduced
in the Rel-15 3GPP 5G NR specifications to support low PAPR transmissions using
the DFT-spread-OFDM waveform in the uplink transmissions. To enable data
demodulation using this modulation scheme, Zadoff-Chu sequences are used as
reference signals. However, the PAPR of Zadoff-Chu sequences is higher when
compared to the pi/2-BPSK data. Therefore, even though the data transmissions
have low PAPR, the high PAPR of the reference signal limits the cell coverage
in the uplink of Rel-15 3GPP 5G NR design. In this paper we propose a
transceiver design which minimizes the PAPR of the reference signals to avoid
the aforementioned issues. We show via simulations that the proposed
architecture results in more than 2 dB PAPR reduction when compared to the
existing design. In addition, when multiple stream transmission is supported,
we show that PAPR of the reference signal transmission remains the same for any
stream (also referred to as baseband antenna port in 3GPP terminology) when the
proposed transceiver design is employed, which is not the case for the current
3GPP 5G NR design

  Efficient Thermal Diodes","This mini-review addresses a bedrock problem for the advance of phononics:
the building of feasible and efficient thermal diodes. We revisit
investigations in classical and quantum systems. For the classical anharmonic
chains of oscillators, the most used model for the study of heat conduction in
insulating solids, we recall the ubiquitous occurrence of thermal rectification
in graded systems, and we show that the match between graded structures and
long range interactions is an efficient mechanism to increase the rectification
factor. For the cases of genuine quantum models, we present the spin chains,
such as the open $XXZ$ model, as profitable systems for the occurrence of
thermal rectification and other interesting related properties. In particular,
we describe two cases of perfect diodes: one for the spin current, in a
two-segmented $XXZ$ model, and another one for the heat current in a simple
quantum Ising model with long range interactions. We believe that such results
involving interesting rectification properties in simple models will stimulate
more theoretical and experimental investigations on the subject.

discriminatory practices related to the use of human-related machine learning
systems, for example in the field of criminal justice, credit scoring and

Data scientists and computer engineers are making various efforts to provide
definitions of fairness. In this paper, we provide an overview of the most
widespread definitions of fairness in the field of machine learning, arguing
that the ideas highlighting each formalization are closely related to different
ideas of justice and to different interpretations of democracy embedded in our
culture. This work intends to analyze the definitions of fairness that have
been proposed to date to interpret the underlying criteria and to relate them

filters that are popularly used in image processing. It was recently shown that
fast and accurate bilateral filtering of grayscale images can be performed
using a low-rank approximation of the kernel matrix. More specifically, based
on the eigendecomposition of the kernel matrix, the overall filtering was
approximated using spatial convolutions, for which efficient algorithms are
available. Unfortunately, this technique cannot be scaled to high-dimensional
data such as color and hyperspectral images. This is simply because one needs
to compute/store a large matrix and perform its eigendecomposition in this
case. We show how this problem can be solved using the Nystr\""om method, which
is generally used for approximating the eigendecomposition of large matrices.
The resulting algorithm can also be used for nonlocal means filtering. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal for bilateral and nonlocal means
filtering of color and hyperspectral images. In particular, our method is shown
to be competitive with state-of-the-art fast algorithms, and moreover it comes
with a theoretical guarantee on the approximation error.

time and cost consuming in terms of resources used. With advances in
observation techniques, high-resolution images with more detailed information
are obtained, which can serve as an input to machine learning (ML) algorithms
to extract Hamiltonian parameters. However, the number of labeled images is
rather limited. Here, we provide a protocol for Hamiltonian parameter
estimation based on a machine learning architecture, which is trained on a
small amount of simulated images and applied to experimental spin configuration
images. Sliding windows on the input images enlarges the number of training
images; therefore we can train well a neural network on a small dataset of
simulated images which are generated adaptively using the same external
conditions such as temperature and magnetic field as the experiment. The neural
network is applied to the experimental image and estimates magnetic parameters
efficiently. We demonstrate the success of the estimation by reproducing the
same configuration from simulation and predict a hysteresis loop accurately.
Our approach paves a way to a stable and general parameter estimation.

highest volume density of molecular gas -- is the most favorable place for
cloud collisions, systematic studies of CCCs in that region are still
untouched. Here we report for the first time evidence of CCCs in the common

identifying CCCs, and we have discovered clear signatures of CCCs. Using the
estimated displacements and relative velocities of the clouds, we find the
elapsed time since the beginnings of the collisions to be 105-6 yr. We consider

  Style Transfer","Style transfer is a field with growing interest and use cases in deep
learning. Recent work has shown Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) can be
used to create realistic images of virtually stained slide images in digital
pathology with clinically validated interpretability. Digital pathology images
are typically of extremely high resolution, making tilewise analysis necessary
for deep learning applications. It has been shown that image generators with
instance normalization can cause a tiling artifact when a large image is
reconstructed from the tilewise analysis. We introduce a novel perceptual
embedding consistency loss significantly reducing the tiling artifact created
in the reconstructed whole slide image (WSI). We validate our results by
comparing virtually stained slide images with consecutive real stained tissue
slide images. We also demonstrate that our model is more robust to contrast,
color and brightness perturbations by running comparative sensitivity analysis
tests.

and flashing light-field to direct the motion of phototactic active colloids.
Here, the colloids self-organize into a density spike pattern, which resembles
a shock wave and propagates over long distances, almost without dispersing. The
underlying mechanism involves a synchronization of the colloids with the
light-field, so that particles see the same intensity gradient each time the
light-pattern is switched on, but no gradient in between (for example). This
creates a pulsating transport whose strength and direction can be controlled
via the flashing protocol and the self-propulsion speed of the colloids. Our
results might be useful for drug delivery applications and can be used to
segregate active colloids by their speed.

devised for preserving the local structures during progressively folding. In

learning. In order to achieve robust and accurate scene understanding,
autonomous vehicles are usually equipped with different sensors (e.g. cameras,
LiDARs, Radars), and multiple sensing modalities can be fused to exploit their
complementary properties. In this context, many methods have been proposed for
deep multi-modal perception problems. However, there is no general guideline
for network architecture design, and questions of ""what to fuse"", ""when to
fuse"", and ""how to fuse"" remain open. This review paper attempts to
systematically summarize methodologies and discuss challenges for deep
multi-modal object detection and semantic segmentation in autonomous driving.
To this end, we first provide an overview of on-board sensors on test vehicles,
open datasets, and background information for object detection and semantic
segmentation in autonomous driving research. We then summarize the fusion
methodologies and discuss challenges and open questions. In the appendix, we
provide tables that summarize topics and methods. We also provide an

provided with a list of alternatives, and is asked to rank them in order of
preference using only drag-and-drop operations. The platform's goal is to
recommend an initial ranking that minimizes the time spent by the user in
arriving at her desired ranking. We develop the first optimization framework to
address this problem, and make theoretical as well as practical contributions.
On the practical side, our experiments on Amazon Mechanical Turk provide two
interesting insights about user behavior: First, that users' ranking strategies
closely resemble selection or insertion sort, and second, that the time taken
for a drag-and-drop operation depends linearly on the number of positions
moved. These insights directly motivate our theoretical model of the
optimization problem. We show that computing an optimal recommendation is
NP-hard, and provide exact and approximation algorithms for a variety of
special cases of the problem. Experimental evaluation on MTurk shows that,
compared to a random recommendation strategy, the proposed approach reduces the
(average) time-to-rank by up to 50%.

trajectory for an autonomous vehicle to execute amongst dense traffic on roads.
This is because the obstacle-free volume in spacetime is very small in these
scenarios for the vehicle to drive through. However, that does not mean the
task is infeasible since human drivers are known to be able to drive amongst
dense traffic by leveraging the cooperativeness of other drivers to open a gap.
The traditional methods fail to take into account the fact that the actions
taken by an agent affect the behaviour of other vehicles on the road. In this
work, we rely on the ability of deep reinforcement learning to implicitly model
such interactions and learn a continuous control policy over the action space
of an autonomous vehicle. The application we consider requires our agent to
negotiate and open a gap in the road in order to successfully merge or change
lanes. Our policy learns to repeatedly probe into the target road lane while
trying to find a safe spot to move in to. We compare against two
model-predictive control-based algorithms and show that our policy outperforms
them in simulation.

controlled optically and we discuss the main properties of this single spin
system. The photoluminescence of individual Cr-doped QDs and their evolution in
magnetic field reveal a large magnetic anisotropy of the Cr spin induced by
local strain. This results in a splitting of the Cr spin states and in a
thermalization on the lower energy states states S$_z$=0 and S$_z$=$\pm$1. The
magneto-optical properties of Cr-doped QDs can be modelled by an effective spin
Hamiltonian including the spin to strain coupling and the influence of the QD
symmetry. We also show that a single Cr spin can be prepared by resonant
optical pumping. Monitoring the intensity of the resonant fluorescence of the
QD during this process permits to probe the dynamics of the optical
initialization of the spin. Hole-Cr flip-flops induced by an interplay of the
hole-Cr exchange interaction and the coupling with acoustic phonons are the
main source of relaxation that explains the efficient resonant optical pumping.
The Cr spin relaxation time is measured in the $\mu s$ range. We evidence that
a Cr spin couples to non-equilibrium acoustic phonons generated during the
optical excitation inside or near the QD). Finally we show that the energy of
any spin state of an individual Cr atom can be independently tuned by a
resonant single mode laser through the optical Stark effect. All these
properties make Cr-doped QDs very promising for the development of hybrid
spin-mechanical systems where a coherent mechanical driving of an individual
spin in an oscillator is required.

  Sites at 28 GHz for 90% Outdoor Coverage","Path gain and effective directional gain in azimuth in urban canyons from
actual rooftop base station sites are characterized based on a massive data set
of 3000 links on 12 streets in two cities, with over 21 million individual
continuous wave power measurements at 28 GHz using vertically polarized
antennas. Large street-to-street path gain variation is found, with median
street path gain varying over 30 dB at similar distances. Coverage in the
street directly illuminated by a roof edge antenna is found to suffer an
average excess loss of 11 dB relative to free space at 200 m, with empirical
slope-intercept fit model representing the data with 7.1 dB standard deviation.
Offsetting the base antenna 5 m away from roof edge, as is common in macro
cellular deployments, introduces an additional average loss of 15 dB at 100 m,
but this additional loss reduces with distance. Around the corner loss is well
modeled by a diffraction formula with an empirically obtained diffraction
coefficient. Effective azimuthal gain degradation due to scatter is limited to
2 dB for 90% of data, supporting effective use of high gain antennas in urban
street canyons.

particle mobility on a lattice. Therefore, the Drude weight, controlling the

is lower than in non-interacting cases. We show that this is not the case when
extending to quasi one-dimensional ladder systems. Relying on bosonization,
perturbative and matrix product states (MPS) calculations, we show that
nearest-neighbor interactions and magnetic fluxes provide a bias between back-

counter-intuitively increase (decrease) with repulsive (attractive)

  Pricing","We consider an increasingly popular demand-response scenario where a user
schedules the flexible electric vehicle (EV) charging load in response to
real-time electricity prices. The objective is to minimize the total charging
cost with user dissatisfaction taken into account. We focus on the online
setting where neither accurate prediction nor distribution of future real-time
prices is available to the user when making irrevocable charging decision in
each time slot. The emphasis on considering user dissatisfaction and achieving
optimal competitive ratio differentiates our work from existing ones and makes
our study uniquely challenging. Our key contribution is two simple online
algorithms with the best possible competitive ratio among all deterministic
algorithms. The optimal competitive ratio is upper-bounded by \min\left\{
\sqrt{\alpha/p_{\min}},p_{\max}/p_{\min}\right\} and the bound is
asymptotically tight with respect to \alpha, where p_{\max} and p_{\min} are
the upper and lower bounds of real-time prices and \alpha\geq p_{\min} captures
the consideration of user dissatisfaction. The bound under small and large
values of \alpha suggests the fundamental difference of the problems with
considering user dissatisfaction (\alpha takes small values) and without
(\alpha takes large values). Along the way we also develop a general technique
for designing online algorithms from an idea hinted in One-Way-Trading Problem,
which can be of independent interest. Simulation results based on real-world
traces corroborate our theoretical findings and show that our algorithms
achieve substantial performance gain as compared to conceivable alternatives.
The results also suggest that increasing EV charging rate limit decreases

QiBAM extends the Grover's search algorithm in two ways to allow for: (1)
approximate matches needed for read errors in genomics, and (2) a distributed
search for multiple solutions over the quantum encoding of DNA sequences. This
approach gives a quadratic speedup over the classical algorithm. A full

method in materials research, able to produce volumetrically large specimens

unsuitable for crystal growth by the floating zone technique, either due to
excessive volatility or due to metastability. Here, we demonstrate a novel
high-pressure laser-based floating zone system (HP-LFZ). The use of lasers for
heating allows implementation of a high-strength metal growth chamber,
permitting greatly enhanced processing pressures over conventional mirror-based

demonstrate a series of example single crystal growths using this design in

  by ALMA","The luminous blue variable (LBV) RMC143 is located in the outskirts of the
30~Doradus complex, a region rich with interstellar material and hot luminous
stars. We report the $3\sigma$ sub-millimetre detection of its circumstellar
nebula with ALMA. The observed morphology in the sub-millimetre is different
than previously observed with HST and ATCA in the optical and centimetre
wavelength regimes. The spectral energy distribution (SED) of RMC143 suggests
that two emission mechanisms contribute to the sub-mm emission: optically thin
bremsstrahlung and dust. Both the extinction map and the SED are consistent
with a dusty massive nebula with a dust mass of $0.055\pm0.018~M_{\odot}$
(assuming $\kappa_{850}=1.7\rm\,cm^{2}\,g^{-1}$). To date, RMC143 has the most
dusty LBV nebula observed in the Magellanic Clouds. We have also re-examined
the LBV classification of RMC143 based on VLT/X-shooter spectra obtained in
2015/16 and a review of the publication record. The radiative transfer code
CMFGEN is used to derive its fundamental stellar parameters. We find an
effective temperature of $\sim 8500$~K, luminosity of log$(L/L_{\odot}) =
5.32$, and a relatively high mass-loss rate of $1.0 \times
10^{-5}~M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. The luminosity is much lower than previously
thought, which implies that the current stellar mass of $\sim8~M_{\odot}$ is
comparable to its nebular mass of $\sim 5.5~M_{\odot}$ (from an assumed
gas-to-dust ratio of 100), suggesting that the star has lost a large fraction
of its initial mass in past LBV eruptions or binary interactions. While the
star may have been hotter in the past, it is currently not hot enough to ionize
its circumstellar nebula. We propose that the nebula is ionized externally by
the hot stars in the 30~Doradus star-forming region.

  slabs","A uniform or periodic dielectric slab can serve as an optical waveguide for
which guided modes are important, and it can also be used as a diffraction
structure for which resonant modes with complex frequencies are relevant.
Guided modes are normally studied below the lightline where they exist
continuously and emerge from points on the lightline, but isolated guided modes
may exist above the lightline and they are the so-called bound states in the
continuum. Resonant modes are usually studied above the lightline (defined
using the real part of the complex frequency), but they are not connected to
the guided modes on the lightline. In this work, through analytic and numerical
calculations for uniform and periodic slabs, we establish an indirect link
between the resonant and guided modes. It is shown that as the (Bloch)
wavenumber is increased, a resonant mode continues its existence below the
lightline, until it reaches its end at an Exceptional Point (EP) where a pair
of improper modes emerge, and one branch of improper modes eventually
approaches the lightline at the starting point of a guided mode. Leaky modes
with a real frequency and a complex (Bloch) wavenumber (propagation constant)
are also related to the improper modes. They emerge at EPs in eigenvalue
formulations where the frequency is regarded as a parameter. Our study is based
on a non-Hermitian eigenvalue formulation that includes resonant, improper and

described by its neural tangent kernel (NTK) as introduced in [20], where it
was proven that in the infinite width limit the NTK converges to an explicit
limiting kernel and it stays constant during training. The NTK was also
implicit in some other recent papers [6,13,14]. In the overparametrization
regime, a fully-trained deep neural network is indeed equivalent to the kernel
regression predictor using the limiting NTK. And the gradient descent achieves
zero training loss for a deep overparameterized neural network. However, it was
observed in [5] that there is a performance gap between the kernel regression
using the limiting NTK and the deep neural networks. This performance gap is
likely to originate from the change of the NTK along training due to the finite
width effect. The change of the NTK along the training is central to describe
the generalization features of deep neural networks.
  In the current paper, we study the dynamic of the NTK for finite width deep
fully-connected neural networks. We derive an infinite hierarchy of ordinary
differential equations, the neural tangent hierarchy (NTH) which captures the
gradient descent dynamic of the deep neural network. Moreover, under certain
conditions on the neural network width and the data set dimension, we prove
that the truncated hierarchy of NTH approximates the dynamic of the NTK up to
arbitrary precision. This description makes it possible to directly study the
change of the NTK for deep neural networks, and sheds light on the observation
that deep neural networks outperform kernel regressions using the corresponding
limiting NTK.

potential items of interest in situations of information overload. In recent
years, the class of session-based recommendation algorithms received more
attention in the research literature. These algorithms base their
recommendations solely on the observed interactions with the user in an ongoing
session and do not require the existence of long-term preference profiles. Most
recently, a number of deep learning based (""neural"") approaches to
session-based recommendations were proposed. However, previous research
indicates that today's complex neural recommendation methods are not always
better than comparably simple algorithms in terms of prediction accuracy.
  With this work, our goal is to shed light on the state-of-the-art in the area
of session-based recommendation and on the progress that is made with neural
approaches. For this purpose, we compare twelve algorithmic approaches, among
them six recent neural methods, under identical conditions on various datasets.
We find that the progress in terms of prediction accuracy that is achieved with
neural methods is still limited. In most cases, our experiments show that
simple heuristic methods based on nearest-neighbors schemes are preferable over
conceptually and computationally more complex methods. Observations from a user
study furthermore indicate that recommendations based on heuristic methods were
also well accepted by the study participants. To support future progress and
reproducibility in this area, we publicly share the session-rec evaluation
framework that was used in our research.

  II. Spatial structure and kinematics of simulated clouds","The evolution of molecular clouds in galactic centres is thought to differ
from that in galactic discs due to a significant influence of the external
gravitational potential. We present a set of numerical simulations of molecular
clouds orbiting on the 100-pc stream of the Central Molecular Zone (the central
$\sim500$ pc of the Galaxy) and characterise their morphological and kinematic
evolution in response to the background potential and eccentric orbital motion.
We find that the clouds are shaped by strong shear and torques, by tidal and
geometric deformation, and by their passage through the orbital pericentre.
Within our simulations, these mechanisms control cloud sizes, aspect ratios,
position angles, filamentary structure, column densities, velocity dispersions,
line-of-sight velocity gradients, spin angular momenta, and kinematic
complexity. By comparing these predictions to observations of clouds on the
Galactic Centre 'dust ridge', we find that our simulations naturally reproduce
a broad range of key observed morphological and kinematic features, which can
be explained in terms of well-understood physical mechanisms. We argue that the
accretion of gas clouds onto the central regions of galaxies, where the
rotation curve turns over and the tidal field is fully compressive, is
accompanied by transformative dynamical changes to the clouds, leading to
collapse and star formation. This can generate an evolutionary progression of
cloud collapse with a common starting point, which either marks the time of
accretion onto the tidally-compressive region or of the most recent pericentre
passage. Together, these processes may naturally produce the synchronised
starbursts observed in numerous (extra)galactic nuclei.

manipulating the spin waves' parameters. Reorientation of an in-plane external

  With Dilated 1D Convolutions","Self-attention has been a huge success for many downstream tasks in NLP,
which led to exploration of applying self-attention to speech problems as well.
The efficacy of self-attention in speech applications, however, seems not fully
blown yet since it is challenging to handle highly correlated speech frames in
the context of self-attention. In this paper we propose a new neural network
model architecture, namely multi-stream self-attention, to address the issue
thus make the self-attention mechanism more effective for speech recognition.
The proposed model architecture consists of parallel streams of self-attention
encoders, and each stream has layers of 1D convolutions with dilated kernels
whose dilation rates are unique given stream, followed by a self-attention
layer. The self-attention mechanism in each stream pays attention to only one
resolution of input speech frames and the attentive computation can be more
efficient. In a later stage, outputs from all the streams are concatenated then
linearly projected to the final embedding. By stacking the proposed
multi-stream self-attention encoder blocks and rescoring the resultant lattices
with neural network language models, we achieve the word error rate of 2.2% on
the test-clean dataset of the LibriSpeech corpus, the best number reported thus
far on the dataset.

candidates over $\sim$4500 deg$^2$ using a reduced proper motion diagram. We
develop a new white dwarf population synthesis code that returns mock
observations of the Galactic field white dwarf population for a given star
formation history, while simultaneously taking into account the geometry of the
Milky Way, survey parameters, and selection effects. We use this model to
derive the star formation histories of the thin disk, thick disk, and stellar
halo. Our results show that the Milky Way disk began forming stars (11.3 $\pm$
0.5) Gyr ago, with a peak rate of (8.8 $\pm$ 1.4) M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ at (9.8
$\pm$ 0.4) Gyr, before a slow decline to a constant rate until the present day
--- consistent with recent results suggesting a merging event with a satellite
galaxy. Studying the residuals between the data and best-fit model shows
evidence for a slight increase in star formation over the past 3 Gyr. We fit
the local fraction of helium-atmosphere white dwarfs to be (21 $\pm$ 3) %.
Incorporating this methodology with data from future wide-field surveys such as
LSST, Euclid, CASTOR, and WFIRST should provide an unprecedented view into the
formation of the Milky Way at its earliest epoch through its white dwarfs.

interest to nuclear physicists, because their attributes can be used to

informative approaches for determining the equation of state of this dense
matter is to measure both a star's equatorial circumferential radius $R_e$ and
its gravitational mass $M$. Here we report estimates of the mass and radius of
the isolated 205.53 Hz millisecond pulsar PSR J0030+0451 obtained using a
Bayesian inference approach to analyze its energy-dependent thermal X-ray
waveform, which was observed using the Neutron Star Interior Composition
Explorer (NICER). This approach is thought to be less subject to systematic
errors than other approaches for estimating neutron star radii. We explored a
variety of emission patterns on the stellar surface. Our best-fit model has
three oval, uniform-temperature emitting spots and provides an excellent
description of the pulse waveform observed using NICER. The radius and mass
estimates given by this model are $R_e = 13.02^{+1.24}_{-1.06}$ km and $M =
1.44^{+0.15}_{-0.14}\ M_\odot$ (68%). The independent analysis reported in the
companion paper by Riley et al. (2019) explores different emitting spot models,
but finds spot shapes and locations and estimates of $R_e$ and $M$ that are
consistent with those found in this work. We show that our measurements of

real world. While robot platforms provide means for interacting with the
physical world they cannot autonomously acquire object-level semantics without
needing human. In this paper, we investigate how to minimize human effort and
intervention to teach robots perform real world tasks that incorporate
semantics. We study this question in the context of visual servoing of mobile
robots and propose DIViS, a Domain Invariant policy learning approach for
collision free Visual Servoing. DIViS incorporates high level semantics from
previously collected static human-labeled datasets and learns collision free
servoing entirely in simulation and without any real robot data. However, DIViS
can directly be deployed on a real robot and is capable of servoing to the
user-specified object categories while avoiding collisions in the real world.
DIViS is not constrained to be queried by the final view of goal but rather is
robust to servo to image goals taken from initial robot view with high
occlusions without this impairing its ability to maintain a collision free
path. We show the generalization capability of DIViS on real mobile robots in
more than 90 real world test scenarios with various unseen object goals in
unstructured environments. DIViS is compared to prior approaches via real world

the type of data that is being manipulated. For instance, the data could be the
point evaluations or the cell-averages of a function, which are the two

not fit into one of the two typical environments. In this paper we show how to
invert this order so we can choose a prediction first and then define a

change in preferred orientation was accompanied by changes in crystal
morphology and shape, resulting in surface nano-roughening. We modeled the
process as the coarsening of oriented C36H74 crystal islands driven by the
decrease in total surface energy. Coarsening kinetics was controlled by
diffusion of single molecular chains along the substrate. Evolution of
nano-roughness during annealing time was well described by a surface coarsening
law. Two additional factors influenced the evolution rate: strains accumulated
in wax crystals during deposition, and divergence of initial crystal shape from
the shape at equilibrium. Both factors lowered activation energy and
effectively shortened coarsening time.

partial and corrupted entries. Despite substantial progress in designing
efficient estimation algorithms, it remains largely unclear how to assess the
uncertainty of the obtained estimates and how to perform statistical inference
on the unknown matrix (e.g.~constructing a valid and short confidence interval
for an unseen entry).
  This paper takes a step towards inference and uncertainty quantification for
noisy matrix completion. We develop a simple procedure to compensate for the
bias of the widely used convex and nonconvex estimators. The resulting
de-biased estimators admit nearly precise non-asymptotic distributional
characterizations, which in turn enable optimal construction of confidence
intervals\,/\,regions for, say, the missing entries and the low-rank factors.
Our inferential procedures do not rely on sample splitting, thus avoiding
unnecessary loss of data efficiency. As a byproduct, we obtain a sharp
characterization of the estimation accuracy of our de-biased estimators, which,
to the best of our knowledge, are the first tractable algorithms that provably
achieve full statistical efficiency (including the preconstant). The analysis
herein is built upon the intimate link between convex and nonconvex
optimization --- an appealing feature recently discovered by
\cite{chen2019noisy}.

scenarios predict for the QCD axion a mass in the range

range require the monitoring of resonant cavity modes with frequency above
5\,GHz, where several experimental limitations occur due to linear amplifiers,
small volumes, and low quality factors of Cu resonant cavities. In this paper
we deal with the last issue, presenting the result of a search for galactic
axions using a haloscope based on a $36\,\mbox{cm}^3$ NbTi superconducting
cavity. The cavity worked at $T=4\,\mbox{K}$ in a 2\,T magnetic field and
exhibited a quality factor $Q_0= 4.5\times10^5$ for the TM010 mode at 9\,GHz.
With such values of $Q$ the axion signal is significantly increased with
respect to copper cavity haloscopes. Operating this setup we set the limit

energy consumption. Pruning can reduce the parameter-counts of many
state-of-the-art neural networks by an order of magnitude without compromising
accuracy, meaning these networks contain a vast amount of unnecessary
structure. In this paper, we study the relationship between pruning and
interpretability. Namely, we consider the effect of removing unnecessary
structure on the number of hidden units that learn disentangled representations
of human-recognizable concepts as identified by network dissection. We aim to
evaluate how the interpretability of pruned neural networks changes as they are
compressed. We find that pruning has no detrimental effect on this measure of
interpretability until so few parameters remain that accuracy beings to drop.

  under Engine Conditions -- Part II: Effect of Flame Structure and Geometry","From experimental spark ignition (SI) engine studies, it is known that the
slow-down of early flame kernel development caused by the
($\mathrm{Le}>1$)-property of common transportation-fuel/air mixtures tends to
increase cycle-to-cycle variations (CCV). To improve the fundamental
understanding of the complex phenomena inside the flame structure of developing
flame kernels, an engine-relevant DNS database is investigated in this work.
Conclusive analyses are enabled by considering equivalent flame kernels and
turbulent planar flames computed with $\mathrm{Le}>1$ and $\mathrm{Le}=1$. In
Part I of the present study (Falkenstein et al., Combust. Flame, 2019), a
reduced representation of the local mixture state based on the parameters local
enthalpy, local equivalence ratio, and H-radical mass fraction was proposed for
the purpose of this analysis. Here, a coupling relation for the
diffusion-controlled mixture parameter local enthalpy with local flame geometry
and structure is derived, characterized by the key parameters $\kappa$ and ${\
|\nabla c \ t|/\ |\nabla c \ |_{\mathrm{lam}}}$. The analysis shows that the
large positive global mean curvature intrinsic to the flame kernel
configuration may detrimentally affect the local mixture state inside the
reaction zone, particularly during the initial kernel development phase.
External energy supply by spark ignition may effectively bridge over this
critical stage, which causes the impact of global mean flame kernel curvature
to be small under the present conditions compared to the overall effect of
$\mathrm{Le}\neq1$. Once ignition effects have decayed, the mixture state
inside the reaction zone locally exhibits an identical dependence on $\ |\nabla
c \ |$ as in a strained laminar flame. This implies that differential diffusion
effects under engine-typical Karlovitz numbers are not weakened by small-scale
turbulent mixing.

that the secondary flux are underestimated in current propagation model. It

enumerator of a binary self-dual, doubly even self-dual, and doubly-doubly even

describe the shape enumerator of a self-dual NRT-code of

this work, we uncover a phenomenon in which the behavior of these complex

becomes independent of the number of neurons as this number grows sufficiently
large. We develop a formalism in which this many-neurons limiting behavior is
captured by a set of equations, thereby exposing a previously unknown operating
regime of these networks. While the current pursuit is mathematically
non-rigorous, it is complemented with several experiments that validate the
existence of this behavior.

  room temperature","Methods of optical dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) open the door to the
replenishable hyperpolarization of nuclear spins, boosting their NMR/MRI
signature by orders of magnitude. Nanodiamond powder rich in negatively charged
Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) defect centers has recently emerged as one such promising
platform, wherein 13C nuclei can be hyperpolarized through the optically pumped
defects completely at room temperature and at low magnetic fields. Given the
compelling possibility of relaying this 13C polarization to nuclei in external
liquids, there is an urgent need for the engineered production of highly
""hyperpolarizable"" diamond particles. In this paper, we report on a systematic
study of various material dimensions affecting optical 13C hyperpolarization in
diamond particles -- especially electron irradiation and annealing conditions
that drive NV center formation. We discover surprisingly that diamond annealing
at elevated temperatures close to 1720C have remarkable effects on the
hyperpolarization levels, enhancing them by upto 36-fold over materials
annealed through conventional means. We unravel the intriguing material origins
of these gains, and demonstrate they arise from a simultaneous improvement in
NV electron relaxation time and coherence time, as well as the reduction of
paramagnetic content, and an increase in 13C relaxation lifetimes. Overall this
points to significant recovery of the diamond lattice from radiation damage as
a result of the high-temperature annealing. Our work suggests methods for the
guided materials production of fluorescent, 13C hyperpolarized, nanodiamonds
and pathways for their use as multi-modal (optical and MRI) imaging and
hyperpolarization agents.

  star-forming main sequence","We present a framework for modelling the star-formation histories of galaxies
as a stochastic process. We define this stochastic process through a power
spectrum density with a functional form of a broken power-law. Star-formation
histories are correlated on short timescales, the strength of this correlation
described by a power-law slope, $\alpha$, and they decorrelate to resemble
white noise over a timescale that is proportional to the timescale of the break
in the power spectrum density, $\tau_{\rm break}$. We use this framework to
explore the properties of the stochastic process that, we assume, gives rise to
the log-normal scatter about the relationship between star-formation rate and
stellar mass, the so-called galaxy star-forming main sequence. Specifically, we
show how the measurements of the normalisation and width ($\sigma_{\rm MS}$) of
the main sequence, measured in several passbands that probe different
timescales, give a constraint on the parameters of the underlying power
spectrum density. We first derive these results analytically for a simplified
case where we model observations by averaging over the recent star-formation
history. We then run numerical simulations to find results for more realistic
observational cases. As a proof of concept, we use observational estimates of
the main sequence scatter at $z\sim0$ and $M_{\star}\approx10^{10}~M_{\odot}$
measured in H$\alpha$, UV+IR and the u-band, and show that combination of these
point to $\tau_{\rm break}=178^{+104}_{-66}$ Myr, when assuming $\alpha=2$.
This implies that star-formation histories of galaxies lose ""memory"" of their
previous activity on a timescale of $\sim200$ Myr, highlighting the importance
of baryonic effects that act over the dynamical timescales of galaxies.

  Euler-Boussinesq equation with transport noise","The prediction of climate change and its impact on extreme weather events is
one of the great societal and intellectual challenges of our time. The first
part of the problem is to make the distinction between weather and climate. The
second part is to understand the dynamics of the fluctuations of the physical
variables. The third part is to predict how the variances of the fluctuations
are affected by statistical correlations in their fluctuating dynamics. This
paper investigates a framework called LA SALT which can meet all three parts of
the challenge for the problem of climate change. As a tractable example of this
framework, we consider the Euler--Boussinesq (EB) equations for an
incompressible stratified fluid flowing under gravity in a vertical plane with
no other external forcing. All three parts of the problem are solved for this
case. In fact, for this problem, the framework also delivers global
well-posedness of the dynamics of the physical variables and closed dynamical
equations for the moments of their fluctuations. Thus, in a well-posed
mathematical setting, the framework developed in this paper shows that the mean
field dynamics combines with an intricate array of correlations in the
fluctuation dynamics to drive the evolution of the mean statistics. The results
of the framework for 2D EB model analysis define its climate, as well as
climate change, weather dynamics, and change of weather statistics, all in the

  Order-Optimal Circuits","Winner-Take-All (WTA) refers to the neural operation that selects a
(typically small) group of neurons from a large neuron pool. It is conjectured
to underlie many of the brain's fundamental computational abilities. However,
not much is known about the robustness of a spike-based WTA network to the
inherent randomness of the input spike trains. In this work, we consider a
spike-based $k$--WTA model wherein $n$ randomly generated input spike trains
compete with each other based on their underlying statistics, and $k$ winners
are supposed to be selected. We slot the time evenly with each time slot of
length $1\, ms$, and model the $n$ input spike trains as $n$ independent
Bernoulli processes. The Bernoulli process is a good approximation of the
popular Poisson process but is more biologically relevant as it takes the
refractory periods into account. Due to the randomness in the input spike
trains, no circuits can guarantee to successfully select the correct winners in
finite time. We focus on analytically characterizing the minimal amount of time
needed so that a target minimax decision accuracy (success probability) can be
reached.
  We first derive an information-theoretic lower bound on the decision time. We
show that to have a (minimax) decision error $\le \delta$ (where $\delta \in
(0,1)$), the computation time of any WTA circuit is at least \[ ((1-\delta)
\log(k(n -k)+1) -1)T_{\mathcal{R}}, \] where $T_{\mathcal{R}}$ is a difficulty
parameter of a WTA task that is independent of $\delta$, $n$, and $k$. We then
design a simple WTA circuit whose decision time is \[ O(
\log\frac{1}{\delta}+\log k(n-k))T_{\mathcal{R}}). \] It turns out that for any
fixed $\delta \in (0,1)$, this decision time is order-optimal in terms of its
scaling in $n$, $k$, and $T_{\mathcal{R}}$.

scientific interest in many aspects. The origin, formation, and evolution of
our Solar System (and other planetary systems) can be better understood by
analysing the constitution and physical properties of small bodies in the Solar
System. Currently, two space missions (Hayabusa2, OSIRIS-REx) have recently
arrived at their respective targets and will bring a sample of the asteroids
back to Earth. Other small body missions have also been selected by, or
proposed to, space agencies. The threat posed to our planet by near-Earth
objects (NEOs) is also considered at the international level, and this has
prompted dedicated research on possible mitigation techniques. The DART
mission, for example, will test the kinetic impact technique. Even ideas for
industrial exploitation have risen during the last years. Lastly, the origin of
water and life on Earth appears to be connected to asteroids. Hence, future
space mission projects will undoubtedly target some asteroids or other SSSBs.
In all these cases and research topics, specific knowledge of the structure and
mechanical behaviour of the surface as well as the bulk of those celestial
bodies is crucial. In contrast to large telluric planets and dwarf planets, a
large proportion of such small bodies is believed to consist of gravitational
aggregates ('rubble piles') with no -- or low -- internal cohesion, with
varying macro-porosity and surface properties (from smooth regolith covered
terrain, to very rough collection of boulders), and varying topography
(craters, depressions, ridges) [...].

""persuasion-based"" defense in stochastic control systems against an unknown
type attacker with a control objective exclusive to its type. For effective
control, such an attacker's actions depend on its belief on the underlying
state of the system. We design a robust ""linear-plus-noise"" signaling strategy
to encode sensor outputs in order to shape the attacker's belief in a strategic
way and correspondingly to persuade the attacker to take actions that lead to
minimum damage with respect to the system's objective. The specific model we
adopt is a Gauss-Markov process driven by a controller with a (partially)
""unknown"" malicious/benign control objective. We seek to defend against the
worst possible distribution over control objectives in a robust way under the
solution concept of Stackelberg equilibrium, where the sensor is the leader. We
show that a necessary and sufficient condition on the covariance matrix of the
posterior belief is a certain linear matrix inequality and we provide a
closed-form solution for the associated signaling strategy. This enables us to
formulate an equivalent tractable problem, indeed a semi-definite program, to
compute the robust sensor design strategies ""globally"" even though the original
optimization problem is non-convex and highly nonlinear. We also extend this
result to scenarios where the sensor makes noisy or partial measurements.
Finally, we analyze the ensuing performance numerically for various scenarios.

of the Standard Model (SM) is an ever-growing mystery. It is possible that the
existence of new `dark sector' forces, yet undiscovered, are the key to solving
this fundamental problem, and one might hope that in the future such forces
might even be `unified' with the ones we already know in some UV-complete
framework. In this paper, following a bottom-up approach, we attempt to take
the first steps in the construction of such a framework. The much-discussed
possibility of the kinetic mixing (KM) of the `dark photon' with the
hypercharge gauge boson of the SM via loops of portal matter (PM) fields,
charged in both sectors, offers an attractive starting point for these efforts.
Given the anticipated finite strength of the KM in a UV-complete theory, the
absence of anomalies, and the lifetime constraints on the PM fields arising
from CMB and nucleosynthesis constraints, PM must behave as vector-like copies
of the known SM fermion fields, such as those which appear naturally in
$E_6$-type models. Within such a setup, the SM and their corresponding partner
PM fields would be related by a new $SU(2)_I$ gauge symmetry. With this
observation as a springboard, we construct a generalization of these ideas
where $SU(2)_I$ is augmented by an additional $U(1)_{I_Y}$ factor so that the
light dark photon is the result of a symmetry breaking analogous to the SM,
\ie, $SU(2)_I\times U(1)_{I_Y}\to U(1)_D$, but with $U(1)_D$ now also broken at
the $\lesssim$ GeV scale. While SM fields are $U(1)_D$ singlets, as in the
conventional dark photon approach, they transform nontrivially under the full
$SU(2)_I\times U(1)_{I_Y}$ gauge group. This approach leads to numerous
interesting signatures, both at low energies and at colliders, and can be
viewed as an initial step in the construction of a more UV-complete framework.

learning is sample efficient, yet sensitive to hyper-parameters setting and
needs efficient exploration; Evolutionary algorithms are stable, but with low
sample efficiency; Imitation learning is both sample efficient and stable,
however it requires the guidance of expert data. In this paper, we propose
Recruitment-imitation Mechanism (RIM) for evolutionary reinforcement learning,
a scalable framework that combines advantages of the three methods mentioned

reinforcement learning agent. This agent can recruit high-fitness actors from
the population of evolutionary algorithms, which instructs itself to learn from
experience replay buffer. At the same time, low-fitness actors in the
evolutionary population can imitate behavior patterns of the reinforcement
learning agent and improve their adaptability. Reinforcement and imitation
learners in this framework can be replaced with any off-policy actor-critic
reinforcement learner or data-driven imitation learner. We evaluate RIM on a
series of benchmarks for continuous control tasks in Mujoco. The experimental
results show that RIM outperforms prior evolutionary or reinforcement learning
methods. The performance of RIM's components is significantly better than
components of previous evolutionary reinforcement learning algorithm, and the
recruitment using soft update enables reinforcement learning agent to learn
faster than that using hard update.

messages from $N$ databases without revealing to any database which of the $K$
messages is being downloaded. In general, the databases can be storage
constrained where each database can only store up to $\mu K L$ bits where
$\frac{1}{N} \leq \mu \leq 1$ and $L$ is the size of each message in bits. Let
$t= \mu N$, a recent work showed that the capacity of Storage Constrained PIR
(SC-PIR) is $\left( 1+ \frac{1}{t} + \frac{1}{t^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{t^{K-1}}
\right)^{-1}$, which is achieved by a storage placement scheme inspired by the
content placement scheme in the literature of coded caching and the original
PIR scheme. Not surprisingly, this achievable scheme requires that each message
is $L = {N \choose t}t^K$ bits in length, which can be impractical. In this
paper, without trying to make the connection between SC-PIR and coded caching
problems, based on a general connection between the Full Storage PIR (FS-PIR)
problem ($\mu = 1$) and SC-PIR problem, we propose a new SC-PIR design idea
using novel storage placement schemes. The proposed schemes significantly
reduce the message size requirement while still meeting the capacity of SC-PIR.
In particular, the proposed SC-PIR schemes require the size of each file to be
only $L = Nt^{K-1}$ compared to the state-of-the-art $L = {N \choose t}t^K$.
Hence, we conclude that PIR may not meet coded caching when the size of $L$ is
constrained.

Here we turn attention to the portrayal of women in movies, an industry that
has a significant influence on society, impacting such aspects of life as
self-esteem and career choice. To this end, we fused data from the online movie
database IMDb with a dataset of movie dialogue subtitles to create the largest
available corpus of movie social networks (15,540 networks). Analyzing this
data, we investigated gender bias in on-screen female characters over the past
century. We find a trend of improvement in all aspects of women`s roles in
movies, including a constant rise in the centrality of female characters. There
has also been an increase in the number of movies that pass the well-known
Bechdel test, a popular--albeit flawed--measure of women in fiction. Here we
propose a new and better alternative to this test for evaluating female roles
in movies. Our study introduces fresh data, an open-code framework, and novel
techniques that present new opportunities in the research and analysis of
movies.

second-order approximation to the Hamiltonian gradient. It is shown numerically
via simulations of an FPU-$\beta$ system and a post-Newtonian conservative
system of compact binaries with one body spinning that the newly proposed
method has extremely good energy-conserving performance, compared to the
Runge-Kutta, implicit midpoint symplectic method and extended phase-space

energy-conserving integrator exhibits a higher computational cost than any one
of the other three algorithms, the superior results justify its use for
satisfying some specific purposes on the preservation of energies in numerical

the semimajor axis in a Keplerian problem in the Solar System or accurately

realisation of a choreography is a composition of independent processes that
behave as specified by the choreography. Existing relations of
correctness/completeness between choreographies and realisations are based on
models where choices are non-deterministic. Resolving non-deterministic choices
into deterministic choices (e.g., conditional statements) is necessary to
correctly characterise the relationship between choreographies and their
implementations with concrete programming languages. We introduce a notion of
realisability for choreographies - called whole-spectrum implementation - where
choices are still non-deterministic in choreographies, but are deterministic in
their implementations. Our notion of whole spectrum implementation rules out
deterministic implementations of roles that, no matter which context they are
placed in, will never follow one of the branches of a non-deterministic choice.
We give a type discipline for checking whole-spectrum implementations. As a
case study, we analyse the POP protocol under the lens of whole-spectrum
implementation.

in 230 \r{A} bins. We perform an atmospheric retrieval of our transmission
spectrum combined with literature HST/WFC3 observations to search for the
presence of clouds/hazes as well as Na, K, H$\alpha$, and $\rm H_2O$ planetary
absorption and stellar spot contamination over a combined spectral range of
5,318 \r{A}-16,420 \r{A}. We do not detect a statistically significant presence
of Na I or K I alkali lines, or H$\alpha$ in the atmosphere of WASP-43b. We
find that the observed transmission spectrum can be best explained by a
combination of heterogeneities on the photosphere of the host star and a clear
planetary atmosphere with $\rm H_2O$. This model yields a log-evidence of
$8.26\pm0.42$ higher than a flat (featureless) spectrum. In particular, the
observations marginally favor the presence of large, low-contrast spots over
the four ACCESS transit epochs with an average covering fraction $f_\text{het}

previous $\rm H_2O$ abundance determinations for this planet.

effects of velocity-dependent light-shifts and Doppler shifts. We show that
this effect is general, common to both absorption and transparency resonances,
and favorably scales with wavelength mismatch. We experimentally confirm the
enhancement of transitions for different low-lying orbitals in rubidium atoms

calculations predict a dramatic enhancement of up to 20-fold increase in
absorption, even in the presence of large homogeneous broadening. More general

sound through an end-to-end modeling within the theory of SL.
  Using the proposed scheme for probabilistic SL-based fusion, IVs are able to
separate faulty from correct data samples with a large margin of safety. Real

$d$-dimensional safe gauge theories, admitting the `t Hooft-Veneziano limit,
are holographically dual to $(d+1)$-dimensional safe noncritical string
theories on asymptotically anti-de Sitter space. We provide evidences for this

feature in the infrared both a weak coupling phase and a strong coupling phase

dilaton and warp factors taking domain-wall or Liouville-wall profiles on

and has received considerable interest recently. A randomized mechanism
satisfying $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy (DP) roughly means that,
except with a small probability $\delta$, altering a record in a dataset cannot
change the probability that an output is seen by more than a multiplicative
factor $e^{\epsilon} $. A well-known solution to $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP is the
Gaussian mechanism initiated by Dwork et al. [1] in 2006 with an improvement by
Dwork and Roth [2] in 2014, where a Gaussian noise amount $\sqrt{2\ln
\frac{2}{\delta}} \times \frac{\Delta}{\epsilon}$ of [1] or $\sqrt{2\ln
\frac{1.25}{\delta}} \times \frac{\Delta}{\epsilon}$ of [2] is added
independently to each dimension of the query result, for a query with
$\ell_2$-sensitivity $\Delta$. Although both classical Gaussian mechanisms
[1,2] assume $0 < \epsilon \leq 1$, our review finds that many studies in the
literature have used the classical Gaussian mechanisms under values of
$\epsilon$ and $\delta$ where the added noise amounts of [1,2] do not achieve
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP. We obtain such result by analyzing the optimal noise
amount $\sigma_{DP-OPT}$ for $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP and identifying $\epsilon$
and $\delta$ where the noise amounts of classical mechanisms are even less than
$\sigma_{DP-OPT}$.
  Since $\sigma_{DP-OPT}$ has no closed-form expression and needs to be
approximated in an iterative manner, we propose Gaussian mechanisms by deriving
closed-form upper bounds for $\sigma_{DP-OPT}$. Our mechanisms achieve
$(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP for any $\epsilon$, while the classical mechanisms [1,2]
do not achieve $(\epsilon,\delta)$-DP for large $\epsilon$ given $\delta$.
Moreover, the utilities of our mechanisms improve those of [1,2] and are close
to that of the optimal yet more computationally expensive Gaussian mechanism.

its spin period. Here we analyze NICER and XMM-Newton observations of RX
J1605.3+3249, in order to address its timing and spectral behavior. Contrary to
a previous tentative detection, but in agreement with the recent work by Pires
et al. (2019), we find no significant pulsation with pulsed fraction higher
than 1.3% (3{\sigma}) for periods above 150 ms. We also find a limit of 2.6%
for periods above 2 ms, despite searches in different energy bands. The X-ray
spectrum can be fit by either a double-blackbody model or by a
single-temperature magnetized atmosphere model, both modified by a Gaussian
absorption line at ~0.44 keV. The origin of the absorption feature as a proton
cyclotron line or as an atomic transition in the neutron star atmosphere is
discussed. The predictions of the best-fit X-ray models extended to IR, optical

($\sim 500$ au). The former component is found to be abundant in SO and SO$_2$
but deficient in CS. The abundance ratio SO/CS is as high as $3^{+13}_{-2}

outflow-shocked region of L1157 B1. However, organic molecules (HCOOCH$_3$,
CH$_3$OCH$_3$, CCH, and c-C$_3$H$_2$) are deficient in Elias 29. We attribute
the deficiency in organic molecules and richness in SO and SO$_2$ to the
evolved nature of the source or the relatively high dust temperature

the number of covariates available is large, potentially only a much smaller

  correlation","Entropy is a measure of heterogeneity widely used in applied sciences, often
when data are collected over space. Recently, a number of approaches has been
proposed to include spatial information in entropy. The aim of entropy is to
synthesize the observed data in a single, interpretable number. In other
studies the objective is, instead, to use data for entropy estimation; several
proposals can be found in the literature, which basically are corrections of
the estimator based on substituting the involved probabilities with
proportions. In this case, independence is assumed and spatial correlation is
not considered. We propose a path for spatial entropy estimation: instead of
correcting the global entropy estimator, we focus on improving the estimation
of its components, i.e. the probabilities, in order to account for spatial
effects. Once probabilities are suitably evaluated, estimating entropy is
straightforward since it is a deterministic function of the distribution.
Following a Bayesian approach, we derive the posterior probabilities of a
multinomial distribution for categorical variables, accounting for spatial
correlation. A posterior distribution for entropy can be obtained, which may be
synthesized as wished and displayed as an entropy surface for the area under
study.

  Discovery","In recent years, the size of big linked data has grown rapidly and this
number is still rising. Big linked data and knowledge bases come from different
domains such as life sciences, publications, media, social web, and so on.
However, with the rapid increasing of data, it is very challenging for people
to acquire a comprehensive collection of cross domain knowledge to meet their
needs. Under this circumstance, it is extremely difficult for people without
expertise to extract knowledge from various domains. Therefore, nowadays human
limited knowledge can't feed the high requirement for discovering large amount
of cross domain knowledge. In this research, we present a big graph analytics
framework aims at addressing this issue by providing semantic methods to
facilitate the management of big graph data from close domains in order to
discover cross domain knowledge in a more accurate and efficient way.

proposed in this work. A special focus in the dissertation is on the
application of the compressive sensing approach in multicomponent signals. The
compressive sensing method becomes popular in the field of signal processing
until recently, and its application in various fields can increase the
acquisition and transmission speed, reduce the complexity of devices, and
reduce energy consumption. The procedure that applies the compressive sensing
in the classification of the wireless communication signals is proposed. The
algorithms for reconstruction of the compressive sensed signals are intensively
developing, and therefore special emphasis in the dissertation is devoted to
the hardware implementation of one of the algorithms for sparse signal
reconstruction.

a black-hole horizon in spherically-symmetric spacetimes. As a probe for these
effects we use a quantised massless scalar field. Specifically, we calculate
two quantities derived from it: the renormalised stress-energy tensor (a
measure of how the field vacuum state affects the spacetime) and the effective
temperature function (a generalisation of Hawking temperature related to the
energy flux of the field vacuum). The subject of our study are spacetimes which
contain a spherical distribution of matter and an empty exterior Schwarzschild
region, separated by a surface which is moving in proximity to the
Schwarzschild radius $r_{\rm s}=2M$, with $M$ the total mass. In particular, we
analyse the consequences of three types of surface movement: an oscillation
just above $r_{\rm s}$, a monotonous approach towards $r_{\rm s}$ in infinite
time and a crossing of $r_{\rm s}$ at different velocities. For a collapsing
matter distribution which follows the expected dynamical evolution in general
relativity, we recover the standard picture of black-hole formation and its
tenuous semiclassical effects. In more general dynamical regimes, allowing
deviations from the standard classical evolution, we obtain a variety of
different effects: from the emission of Hawking-like radiation without the
formation of a horizon, to large values of the renormalised stress-energy
tensor, related to the Boulware vacuum divergence in static spacetimes.

modes indirectly via the interaction with p modes observed directly by the GOLF
instrument on SOHO. They concluded that the core of the Sun is rotating 3:8 ?
0:1 times faster than the surrounding radiative envelope. This is startling,
partly because such rapid rotation almost contradicts direct inferences from
the p-mode rotational splitting inferred from the same data. Moreover, the
inferred amplitudes of the g modes appear to exceed the upper bound reported by
Appourchaux et al. (2010). It is also suspect because the theory of the
procedure implies that the principal modes claimed to have been measured should
be undetectable. We point out that there are other interpretations: one leads
to a core rotation about twice faster than the surrounding envelope; another,
to a core rotating more slowly than the envelope. Here we also report on an
independent assessment of the Fossat et al. analysis by applying their
procedure to different representations of the GOLF data, expanding on Schunker
et al. (2018). We also analyze seismic data obtained from LOI and MDI (both
also on SOHO), from HMI (on SDO) and from the ground-based BiSON and GONG, and
found the evidence reported by Fossat et al. not to be robust. We also
illustrate that merely fitting model spectra to observations, which Fossat et
al. do to support their g-mode detections and as Fossat & Schmider (2018) do
for extracting additional g-mode splittings, is not necessarily reliable. We
are therefore led to doubt the claim.

as it inspired Shor to discover the celebrated quantum algorithm solving
integer factorization in polynomial time. Besides, the quantum algorithm for
Simon's problem has been recently applied to break symmetric cryptosystems.
Generalized Simon's problem, denoted by $\mathsf{GSP}(p,n,k)$, is a natural
extension of Simon's problem. In this paper we consider the query complexity of
$\mathsf{GSP}(p,n,k)$. First, it is not difficult to design a quantum algorithm
solving the above problem with query complexity of $O(n-k)$. However, so far it
is not clear what is the classical query complexity of the problem, and
revealing this complexity is necessary for clarifying the computational power
gap between quantum and classical computing on the problem.
  To tackle this problem, we prove that any classical (deterministic or
randomized) algorithm for $\mathsf{GSP}(p,n,k)$ has to query at least
$\Omega\left(\max\{k, \sqrt{p^{n-k}}\}\right)$ values and any classical
nonadaptive deterministic algorithm for $\mathsf{GSP}(p,n,k)$ has to query at
least $\Omega\left(\max\{k, \sqrt{k \cdot p^{n-k}}\}\right)$ values. Hence, we
clearly show the classical computing model is less powerful than the quantum
counterpart, in terms of query complexity for the generalized Simon's problem.
Moreover, we obtain an upper bound $O\left(\max\{k, \sqrt{k \cdot
p^{n-k}}\}\right)$ on the classical deterministic query complexity of
$\mathsf{GSP}(p,n,k)$, by devising a subtle classical algorithm based on group
theory and the divide-and-conquer approach. Therefore, we have an almost full
characterization of the classical deterministic query complexity of the

minimum multiway $k$-cut problem defined over static and dynamic {\em
digraphs}. A multiway $k$-cut problem requires partitioning the set of nodes in
a graph into $k$ subsets, such that each subset contains one prespecified node,
and the corresponding total cut weight is minimized. These problems arise in
many applications and are computationally complex (NP-hard). In the static
setting this article presents an approach that uses a relaxed multiway $k$-cut
cost function; we show that the resulting algorithm converges to a local
minimum. This iterative algorithm is designed to avoid poor local minima with
its run-time complexity as $\sim O(kIN^3)$, where $N$ is the number of vertices
and $I$ is the number of iterations. In the dynamic setting, the edge-weight
matrix has an associated dynamics with some of the edges in the graph capable
of being influenced by an external input. The objective is to design the
dynamics of the controllable edges so that multiway $k$-cut value remains small
(or decreases) as the graph evolves under the dynamics. Also it is required to
determine the time-varying partition that defines the minimum multiway $k$-cut
value. Our approach is to choose a relaxation of multiway $k$-cut value,
derived using maximum entropy principle, and treat it as a control Lyapunov
function to design control laws that affect the weight dynamics. Simulations on
practical examples of interactive foreground-background segmentation, minimum
multiway $k$-cut optimization for non-planar graphs and dynamically evolving
graphs that demonstrate the efficacy of the algorithm, are presented.

show the existence of quasi-conserved observables, which imply exponentially

state-of-the-art Lieb-Robinson bounds for power-law systems from two-body

than previously established in the literature. Additionally, we conjecture that
the gap between the results from the linear response theory and the Magnus-like

of tight Lieb-Robinson bounds for power-law interactions. We show that the gap

  Energy in Solar and Stellar Flares","During solar flares, a large fraction of the released magnetic energy is
carried by energetic electrons that transfer and deposit energy in the Sun's
atmosphere. Electron transport is often approximated by a cold thick-target
model (CTTM), assuming that electron energy is much larger than the temperature
of the ambient plasma, and electron energy evolution is modeled as a systematic
loss. Using kinetic modeling of electrons, we re-evaluate the transport and
deposition of flare energy. Using a full collisional warm-target model (WTM),
we account for electron thermalization and for the properties of the ambient
coronal plasma such as its number density, temperature and spatial extent. We
show that the deposition of non-thermal electron energy in the lower atmosphere
is highly dependent on the properties of the flaring coronal plasma. In
general, thermalization and a reduced WTM energy loss rate leads to an increase
of non-thermal energy transferred to the chromosphere, and the deposition of
non-thermal energy at greater depths. The simulations show that energy is
deposited in the lower atmosphere initially by high energy non-thermal
electrons, and later by lower energy non-thermal electrons that partially or
fully thermalize in the corona, over timescales of seconds, unaccounted for in
previous studies. This delayed heating may act as a diagnostic of both the
injected non-thermal electron distribution and the coronal plasma, vital for
constraining flare energetics.

footprint or wasteful spending. We introduce quantum machine learning (QML)
models of the computational cost of common quantum chemistry tasks. For 2D
non-linear toy systems, single point, geometry optimization, and transition
state calculations the out of sample prediction error of QML models of wall
times decays systematically with training set size. We present numerical
evidence for a toy system containing two functions and three commonly used
optimizer and for thousands of organic molecular systems including closed and
open shell equilibrium structures, as well as transition states. Levels of
electronic structure theory considered include B3LYP/def2-TZVP, MP2/6-311G(d),
local CCSD(T)/VTZ-F12, CASSCF/VDZ-F12, and MRCISD+Q-F12/VDZ-F12. In comparison
to conventional indiscriminate job treatment, QML based wall time predictions
significantly improve job scheduling efficiency for all tasks after training on
just thousands of molecules. Resulting reductions in CPU time overhead range
from 10% to 90%.

  Decays","Conceivable Lorentz-violating effects in the neutrino sector remain a
research area of great general interest, as they touch upon the very
foundations on which the Standard Model and our general understanding of
fundamental interactions is laid. Here, we investigate the relation of Lorentz
violation in the neutrino sector in light of the fact that neutrinos and
corresponding left-handed charged leptons form SU(2)_L doublets under the
electroweak gauge group. Lorentz-violating effects thus cannot be fully
separated from questions related to gauge invariance. The model dependence of
the effective interaction Lagrangians used in various recent investigations is
investigated, with a special emphasis on neutrino splitting, otherwise known as
neutrino-pair Cerenkov radiation, NPCR, and vacuum pair emission
(electron-positron-pair Cerenkov radiation, LPCR). We investigate two scenarios
in which Lorentz violating effects do not necessarily also break electroweak
gauge invarianceThe first of these involves a restricted set of gauge
transformation, a subgroup of SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y, while in the second,
differential Lorentz violation is exclusively introduced by the mixing of the
neutrino flavor and mass eigenstates. Our study culminates in a model which
fully preserves SU(2)_L x U(1)_Y gauge invariance, involves flavor-dependent
Lorentz-breaking parameters, and still allows for NPCR and LPCR decays to
proceed.

  coupled to Majorana zero modes","Odd-frequency superconductivity is an exotic phase of matter in which Cooper
pairing between electrons is entirely dynamical in nature. Majorana zero modes
exhibit pure odd-frequency superconducting correlations due to their specific
properties. Thus, by tunnel-coupling an array of Majorana zero modes to a
spin-polarized wire, it is in principle possible to engineer a bulk
one-dimensional odd-frequency spinless $s$-wave superconductor. We here point
out that each tunnel coupling element, being dependent on a large number of
material-specific parameters, is generically complex with sample variability in
both its magnitude and phase. Using this, we demonstrate that, upon averaging
over phase-disorder, the induced superconducting, including odd-frequency,
correlations in the spin-polarized wire are significantly suppressed. We
perform both a rigorous analytical evaluation of the disorder-averaged
$T$-matrix in the wire, as well as numerical calculations based on a
tight-binding model, and find that the anomalous, i.e. superconducting, part of
the $T$-matrix is highly suppressed with phase disorder. We also demonstrate
that this suppression is concurrent with the filling of the single-particle
excitation gap by smearing the near-zero frequency peaks, due to formation of
bound states that satisfy phase-matching conditions between spatially separated
Majorana zero modes. Our results convey important constraints on the parameter
control needed in practical realizations of Majorana zero mode structures and
suggest that the achievement of a bulk 1D odd-$\omega$ superconductivity from
MZMs demand full control of the system parameters.

inconsistent behavior of a different type of anomalies and imbalanced available

First, the background is estimated from recent history frames to identify the
motionless objects. This background image is used to localize the
normal/abnormal behavior within the frame. Further, we detect an object of

time-stamp aware anomaly detection algorithm. We also discuss the challenges

  Classification","Recently, deep learning based natural language processing techniques are
being extensively used to deal with spam mail, censorship evaluation in social

vulnerabilities of such deep neural networks. Here, we go beyond attacks to
investigate, for the first time, universal rules, i.e., rules that are sample
agnostic and therefore could turn any text sample in an adversarial one. In
fact, the universal rules do not use any information from the method itself (no
information from the method, gradient information or training dataset
information is used), making them black-box universal attacks. In other words,
the universal rules are sample and method agnostic. By proposing a
coevolutionary optimization algorithm we show that it is possible to create
universal rules that can automatically craft imperceptible adversarial samples
(only less than five perturbations which are close to misspelling are inserted
in the text sample). A comparison with a random search algorithm further
justifies the strength of the method. Thus, universal rules for fooling
networks are here shown to exist. Hopefully, the results from this work will
impact the development of yet more sample and model agnostic attacks as well as
their defenses, culminating in perhaps a new age for artificial intelligence.

noticed correspondence between the swampland approach in quantum gravity and
geometric flow equations in general relativity, most notably the Ricci flow. We
conjecture that following the gradient flow towards a fixed point, which is at
infinite distance in the space of background metrics, is accompanied by an
infinite tower of states in quantum gravity. In case of the Ricci flow, this
conjecture is in accordance with the generalized distance and AdS distance
conjectures, which were recently discussed in the literature, but it should
also hold for more general background spaces. We argue that the entropy
functionals of gradient flows provide a useful definition of the generalized
distance in the space of background fields. In particular we give evidence that
for the Ricci flow the distance $\Delta$ can be defined in terms of the mean
scalar curvature of the manifold, $\Delta\sim\log \bar R$. For a more general
gradient flow, the distance functional also depends on the string coupling
constant.
  In the second part of the paper we will apply the generalized distance
conjecture to gravity theories with higher curvature interactions, like higher
derivative $R^2$ and $W^2$ terms. We will show that going to the weak coupling
limit of the higher derivative terms corresponds to the infinite distance limit
in metric space and hence this limit must be accompanied by an infinite tower
of light states. For the case of the $R^2$ or $W^2$ couplings, this limit
corresponds to the limit of a small cosmological constant or, respectively, to
a light additional spin-two field in gravity. In general we see that the limit
of small higher curvature couplings belongs to the swampland in quantum
gravity, just like the limit of a small $U(1)$ gauge coupling belongs to the
swampland as well.

set of entities (i.e. nodes) connected via different types of connections (i.e.
layers). The observed connections in these networks may not be complete and the
link prediction task is about locating the missing links across layers. Here,
the main challenge is about collecting relevant evidence from different layers
to assist the link prediction task. It is known that co-membership in
communities increases the likelihood of connectivity between nodes. We discuss
that co-membership in the communities of the similar layers augments the chance
of connectivity. The layers are considered similar if they show significant
inter-layer community overlap. Moreover, we found that although the presence of
link is correlated in layers but the extent of this correlation is not the same
across different communities. Our proposed, ML-BNMTF, as a link prediction
method in multiplex networks, is devised based on these findings. ML-BNMTF
outperforms baseline methods specifically when the global link overlap is low.

  evolution strongly favoured over orientation","A minority of the optically selected quasar population are red at optical
wavelengths due to the presence of dust along the line-of-sight. A key focus of
many red quasar studies is to understand their relationship with the overall
quasar population: are they blue quasars observed at a (slight) inclination
angle or do they represent a transitional phase in the evolution of quasars?
Identifying fundamental differences between red and blue quasars is key to
discriminate between these two paradigms. To robustly explore this, we have
uniformly selected quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey with mid-infrared
counterparts, carefully controlling for luminosity and redshift effects. We
take a novel approach to distinguish between colour-selected quasars in the
redshift range of $0.2 < z < 2.4$ by constructing redshift-sensitive $g^* -
i^*$ colour cuts. From cross-matching this sample to the Faint Images of the
Radio Sky at Twenty-centimeters (FIRST) survey, we have found a factor
$\approx$ 3 larger fraction of radio-detected red quasars with respect to that
of blue quasars. Through a visual inspection of the FIRST images and an
assessment of the radio luminosities (rest-frame ${L_{\rm 1.4~GHz}}$ and
${L_{\rm 1.4~GHz}}/{L_{\rm 6\mu m}}$) we find that the radio-detection excess
for red quasars is primarily due to compact and radio-faint systems (around the
radio quiet--radio loud threshold). We show that our results rule out
orientation as the origin for the differences between red and blue quasars and
argue that they provide broad agreement with an evolutionary model.

luminosity of 5.5x10^41 erg/s. Its light curve has the double-peak shape
typical of Luminous Red Novae (LRNe), with a narrow first peak bright in the
blue bands, while the second peak is longer lasting and more luminous in the
red and near-infrared (NIR) bands. During the first peak, the spectrum shows a
blue continuum with narrow emission lines of H and Fe II. During the second
peak, the spectrum becomes cooler, resembling that of a K-type star, and the
emission lines are replaced by a forest of narrow lines in absorption. About 5
months later, while the optical light curves are characterized by a fast linear
decline, the NIR ones show a moderate rebrightening, observed until the
transient disappeared in solar conjunction. At these late epochs, the spectrum
becomes reminiscent of that of M-type stars, with prominent molecular
absorption bands. The late-time properties suggest the formation of some dust
in the expanding common envelope or an IR echo from foreground pre-existing

extensively used as a public bulletin board by many different applications that
heavily relies on its immutability. However, Bitcoin's immutability is not
without its fair share of demerits. Interpol exposed the existence of harmful
and potentially illegal documents, images and links in the Bitcoin blockchain,
and since then there have been several qualitative and quantitative analysis on
the types of data currently residing in the Bitcoin blockchain.
  Although there is a lot of attention on blockchains, surprisingly the
previous solutions proposed for data redaction in the permissionless setting
are far from feasible, and require additional trust assumptions. Hence, the
problem of harmful data still poses a huge challenge for law enforcement
agencies like Interpol (Tziakouris, IEEE S&P'18).
  We propose the first efficient redactable blockchain for the permissionless
setting that is easily integrable into Bitcoin, and that does not rely on heavy
cryptographic tools or trust assumptions. Our protocol uses a consensus-based
voting and is parameterised by a policy that dictates the requirements and
constraints for the redactions; if a redaction gathers enough votes the
operation is performed on the chain. As an extra feature, our protocol offers
public verifiability and accountability for the redacted chain. Moreover, we
provide formal security definitions and proofs showing that our protocol is
secure against redactions that were not agreed by consensus. Additionally, we
show the viability of our approach with a proof-of-concept implementation that
shows only a tiny overhead in the chain validation of our protocol when
compared to an immutable one.

  Non-Strongly Convex Objectives","Decentralized optimization has found a significant utility in recent years,
as a promising technique to overcome the curse of dimensionality when dealing
with large-scale inference and decision problems in big data. While these
algorithms are resilient to node and link failures, they however, are not
inherently Byzantine fault-tolerant towards insider data injection attacks.
This paper proposes a decentralized robust subgradient push (RSGP) algorithm
for detection and isolation of malicious nodes in the network for optimization
non-strongly convex objectives. In the attack considered in this work, the
malicious nodes follow the algorithmic protocols, but can alter their local
functions arbitrarily. However, we show that in sufficiently structured
problems, the method proposed is effective in revealing their presence. The
algorithm isolates detected nodes from the regular nodes, thereby mitigating
the ill-effects of malicious nodes. We also provide performance measures for
the proposed method.

list-decodable setting where an adversary can corrupt a greater than $1/2$
fraction of examples.
  For any $\alpha < 1$, our algorithm takes as input a sample $\{(x_i,y_i)\}_{i
\leq n}$ of $n$ linear equations where $\alpha n$ of the equations satisfy $y_i
= \langle x_i,\ell^*\rangle +\zeta$ for some small noise $\zeta$ and
$(1-\alpha)n$ of the equations are {\em arbitrarily} chosen. It outputs a list
$L$ of size $O(1/\alpha)$ - a fixed constant - that contains an $\ell$ that is
close to $\ell^*$.
  Our algorithm succeeds whenever the inliers are chosen from a
\emph{certifiably} anti-concentrated distribution $D$. In particular, this
gives a $(d/\alpha)^{O(1/\alpha^8)}$ time algorithm to find a $O(1/\alpha)$
size list when the inlier distribution is standard Gaussian. For discrete
product distributions that are anti-concentrated only in \emph{regular}
directions, we give an algorithm that achieves similar guarantee under the
promise that $\ell^*$ has all coordinates of the same magnitude. To complement
our result, we prove that the anti-concentration assumption on the inliers is
information-theoretically necessary.
  Our algorithm is based on a new framework for list-decodable learning that
strengthens the `identifiability to algorithms' paradigm based on the
sum-of-squares method.
  In an independent and concurrent work, Raghavendra and Yau also used the
Sum-of-Squares method to give a similar result for list-decodable regression.

the autoregressive nature makes inference difficult to parallelize and leads to
high translation latency. Inspired by recent refinement-based approaches, we
propose LaNMT, a latent-variable non-autoregressive model with continuous
latent variables and deterministic inference procedure. In contrast to existing
approaches, we use a deterministic inference algorithm to find the target
sequence that maximizes the lowerbound to the log-probability. During
inference, the length of translation automatically adapts itself. Our
experiments show that the lowerbound can be greatly increased by running the
inference algorithm, resulting in significantly improved translation quality.
Our proposed model closes the performance gap between non-autoregressive and
autoregressive approaches on ASPEC Ja-En dataset with 8.6x faster decoding. On
WMT'14 En-De dataset, our model narrows the gap with autoregressive baseline to
2.0 BLEU points with 12.5x speedup. By decoding multiple initial latent

further brings the gap down to 1.0 BLEU point on WMT'14 En-De task with 6.8x

we make use of an economical scalar sector composed of a bi-doublet, two

since the invention of statistical mechanics, which establishes the connection

translates the deterministic evolution of a dynamical system to its
probabilistic exploration of the state space. To-date research focuses on
determining the conditions of stochasticity for particular systems. Here we
propose an alternative agenda and prove thermalization for non-stochastic
Hamiltonian systems. This shows that thermalization happens in both stochastic
and non-stochastic systems, reducing the need to rely on stochasticity in a
""coarse-grained"" analysis. The result is valid for an arbitrary classical
Hamiltonian system and does not rely on the thermodynamic limit or the
particular form of the interaction potential. It utilizes the property of
adiabatic invariance, and reveals a deep relation between the structure of the

Partly motivated by the work of Tamo et al. (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 59(3),
1597-1616, 2013), in this paper, we present a transformation that can greatly
reduce the sub-packetization level of MDS codes with the optimal repair

transformation, four high-rate MDS codes having both small sub-packetization
level and near-optimal repair bandwidth can be obtained, where three of them
are explicit and the required field sizes are around or even smaller than the
code length n. Additionally, we propose another explicit MDS code which has a
similar structure as that of the first resultant code obtained by the generic
transformation, but can be built on a smaller finite field.

several applications in materials science and geophysical fluid flows. The
non-trivial topology manifests itself in the existence of topologically
protected, asymmetric edge states at the interface between two two-dimensional
half spaces in different topological phases. It is characterized by a quantized
interface conductivity. The objective of this paper is to compute such a
conductivity and show its stability under perturbations. We present two
methods.
  The first one computes the conductivity using the winding number of branches
of absolutely continuous spectrum of the interface Hamiltonian. This
calculation is independent of any bulk properties but requires a sufficient
understanding of the spectral decomposition of the Hamiltonian. In the fluid
flow setting, it also applies in cases where the so-called bulk-interface
correspondence fails.
  The second method establishes a bulk-interface correspondence between the
interface conductivity and a so-called bulk-difference invariant. We introduce
the bulk-difference invariants characterizing pairs of half spaces. We then
relate the interface conductivity to the bulk-difference invariant by means of
a Fedosov-H\""ormander formula, which computes the index of a related Fredholm
operator.
  The two methods are used to compute invariants for representative $2\times2$

across the Hubble sequence, using integral-field spectroscopic data from the
CALIFA survey. Adopting the same $\lambda_\mathrm{R}$ parameter previously used
to distinguish between slow and fast rotating early-type (elliptical and
lenticular) galaxies, we show that spiral galaxies as expected are almost all
fast rotators. Given the extent of our data, we provide relations for
$\lambda_\mathrm{R}$ measured in different apertures, including conversions to
long-slit 1D apertures. Our sample displays a wide range of
$\lambda_\mathrm{Re}$ values, consistent with previous IFS studies. The fastest
rotators are dominated by relatively massive and highly star-forming Sb
galaxies, which preferentially reside in the main star-forming sequence. These
galaxies reach $\lambda_\mathrm{Re}$ values of $\sim$0.85, are the largest
galaxies at a given mass, and display some of the strongest stellar population
gradients. Compared to the population of S0 galaxies, our findings suggest that
fading may not be the dominant mechanism transforming spirals into lenticulars.
Interestingly, we find that $\lambda_\mathrm{Re}$ decreases for late-type Sc
and Sd spiral galaxies, with values than in occasions puts them in the
slow-rotator regime. While for some of them this can be explained by their
irregular morphologies and/or face-on configurations, others are edge-on
systems with no signs of significant dust obscuration. The latter are typically
at the low-mass end, but this does not explain their location in the classical
($V/\sigma$,$\varepsilon$) and ($\lambda_\mathrm{Re}$,$\varepsilon$) diagrams.
Our initial investigations, based on dynamical models, suggest that these are
dynamically hot disks, probably influenced by the observed important fraction
of dark matter within R$_\mathrm{e}$.

  quantum systems","We review different tensor network approaches to study the spreading of
operators in generic nonintegrable quantum systems. As a common ground to all
methods, we quantify this spreading by means of the Frobenius norm of the
commutator of a spreading operator with a local operator, which is usually
referred to as the out of time order correlation (OTOC) function. We compare
two approaches based on matrix-product states in the Schr\""odinger picture: the
time dependent block decimation (TEBD) and the time dependent variational
principle (TDVP), as well as TEBD based on matrix-product operators directly in
the Heisenberg picture. The results of all methods are compared to numerically
exact results using Krylov space exact time evolution. We find that for the
Schr\""odinger picture the TDVP algorithm performs better than the TEBD
algorithm. Moreover the tails of the OTOC are accurately obtained both by TDVP
MPS and TEBD MPO. They are in very good agreement with exact results at short
times, and appear to be converged in bond dimension even at longer times.
However the growth and saturation regimes are not well captured by both
methods.

simultaneous classification and feature selection, by detecting the features

  Length","We investigate the sample complexity of networks with bounds on the magnitude
of its weights. In particular, we consider the class \[
H=\left\{W_t\circ\rho\circ \ldots\circ\rho\circ W_{1} :W_1,\ldots,W_{t-1}\in
M_{d, d}, W_t\in M_{1,d}\right\} \] where the spectral norm of each $W_i$ is
bounded by $O(1)$, the Frobenius norm is bounded by $R$, and $\rho$ is the
sigmoid function $\frac{e^x}{1+e^x}$ or the smoothened ReLU function $ \ln
(1+e^x)$. We show that for any depth $t$, if the inputs are in $[-1,1]^d$, the
sample complexity of $H$ is $\tilde O\left(\frac{dR^2}{\epsilon^2}\right)$.
This bound is optimal up to log-factors, and substantially improves over the
previous state of the art of $\tilde O\left(\frac{d^2R^2}{\epsilon^2}\right)$.
  We furthermore show that this bound remains valid if instead of considering
the magnitude of the $W_i$'s, we consider the magnitude of $W_i - W_i^0$, where
$W_i^0$ are some reference matrices, with spectral norm of $O(1)$. By taking
the $W_i^0$ to be the matrices at the onset of the training process, we get
sample complexity bounds that are sub-linear in the number of parameters, in
many typical regimes of parameters.
  To establish our results we develop a new technique to analyze the sample
complexity of families $H$ of predictors. We start by defining a new notion of
a randomized approximate description of functions $f:X\to\mathbb{R}^d$. We then
show that if there is a way to approximately describe functions in a class $H$
using $d$ bits, then $d/\epsilon^2$ examples suffices to guarantee uniform
convergence. Namely, that the empirical loss of all the functions in the class
is $\epsilon$-close to the true loss. Finally, we develop a set of tools for
calculating the approximate description length of classes of functions that can
be presented as a composition of linear function classes and non-linear

of superfluid models of dark matter with finite temperatures. Of particular
interest is the evolution of small-scale structures where the pressure and
superfluid properties of the dark matter fluid are prominent. We compare the
growth of structures in these models with the standard cold dark matter
paradigm and non-superfluid dark matter. The equations for superfluid
hydrodynamics were computed numerically in an expanding $\Lambda$CDM background
with spherical symmetry; the effect of various superfluid fractions,
temperatures, interactions, and masses on the collapse of structures was taken
into consideration. We derived the linear perturbation of the superfluid
equations, giving further insights into the dynamics of the superfluid
collapse. We found that while a conventional dark matter fluid with
self-interactions and finite temperatures experiences a suppression in the
growth of structures on smaller scales, as expected due to the presence of
pressure terms, a superfluid can collapse much more efficiently than was
naively expected due to its ability to suppress the growth of entropy
perturbations and thus gradients in the thermal pressure. We also found that
the cores of the dark matter halos initially become more superfluid during the
collapse, but eventually reach a point where the superfluid fraction falls
sharply. The formation of superfluid dark matter halos surrounded by a normal
fluid dark matter background is therefore disfavored by the present work.

models, but it is typically noisy and that noise can vary with the distant
labeling technique. In this work, we propose a two-stage procedure for handling
this type of data: denoise it with a learned model, then train our final model
on clean and denoised distant data with standard supervised training. Our
denoising approach consists of two parts. First, a filtering function discards
examples from the distantly labeled data that are wholly unusable. Second, a
relabeling function repairs noisy labels for the retained examples. Each of
these components is a model trained on synthetically-noised examples generated
from a small manually-labeled set. We investigate this approach on the
ultra-fine entity typing task of Choi et al. (2018). Our baseline model is an
extension of their model with pre-trained ELMo representations, which already
achieves state-of-the-art performance. Adding distant data that has been
denoised with our learned models gives further performance gains over this base
model, outperforming models trained on raw distant data or
heuristically-denoised distant data.

  them","We use Bub's (2016) correlation arrays and Pitowksy's (1989b) correlation
polytopes to analyze an experimental setup due to Mermin (1981) for
measurements on the singlet state of a pair of spin-$\frac12$ particles. The
class of correlations allowed by quantum mechanics in this setup is represented
by an elliptope inscribed in a non-signaling cube. The class of correlations
allowed by local hidden-variable theories is represented by a tetrahedron
inscribed in this elliptope. We extend this analysis to pairs of particles of
arbitrary spin. The class of correlations allowed by quantum mechanics is still
represented by the elliptope; the subclass of those allowed by local
hidden-variable theories by polyhedra with increasing numbers of vertices and
facets that get closer and closer to the elliptope. We use these results to
advocate for an interpretation of quantum mechanics like Bub's. Probabilities
and expectation values are primary in this interpretation. They are determined
by inner products of vectors in Hilbert space. Such vectors do not themselves
represent what is real in the quantum world. They encode families of
probability distributions over values of different sets of observables. As in
classical theory, these values ultimately represent what is real in the quantum
world. Hilbert space puts constraints on possible combinations of such values,
just as Minkowski space-time puts constraints on possible spatio-temporal
constellations of events. Illustrating how generic such constraints are, the
equation for the elliptope derived in this paper is a general constraint on
correlation coefficients that can be found in older literature on statistics
and probability theory. Yule (1896) already stated the constraint. De Finetti
(1937) already gave it a geometrical interpretation.

  Systems with Stealthy Attacks","Designing resilient control strategies for mitigating stealthy attacks is a
crucial task in emerging cyber-physical systems. In the design of anomaly
detectors, it is common to assume Gaussian noise models to maintain
tractability; however, this assumption can lead the actual false alarm rate to
be significantly higher than expected. We propose a distributionally robust
anomaly detector for noise distributions in moment-based ambiguity sets. We
design a detection threshold that guarantees that the actual false alarm rate
is upper bounded by the desired one by using generalized Chebyshev
inequalities. Furthermore, we highlight an important trade-off between the
worst-case false alarm rate and the potential impact of a stealthy attacker by
efficiently computing an outer ellipsoidal bound for the attack-reachable
states corresponding to the distributionally robust detector threshold. We
illustrate this trade-off with a numerical example and compare the proposed
approach with a traditional chi-squared detector.

approaches, our work introduces a novel attention mechanism capable of
inferring the immensity of the effect of each past utterance on the current

means of innovative self-attention arguments. Our self-attention networks
capture the correlation patterns among consecutive encoder network states, thus
allowing to robustly and effectively model temporal dynamics over arbitrary
long temporal horizons. Thus, we enable capturing strong affective patterns

multi-million-degree corona to the much cooler chromosphere. The temperature
and density structure of quasi-static loops is determined by the continuous
flow of energy from the hot corona to the lower solar atmosphere. Loop scaling
laws provide relationships between global properties of the loop (such as peak
temperature, pressure, and length); they follow from the physical variable
dependencies of various terms in the energy equation, and hence the form of the
loop scaling law provides insight into the key physics that controls the loop
structure. Traditionally, scaling laws have been derived under the assumption
of collision-dominated thermal conduction. Here we examine the impact of
different regimes of thermal conduction -- collision-dominated,
turbulence-dominated, and free-streaming -- on the form of the scaling laws
relating the loop temperature and heating rate to its pressure and half-length.
We show that the scaling laws for turbulence-dominated conduction are
fundamentally different than those for collision-dominated and free-streaming
conduction, inasmuch as the form of the scaling laws now depend primarily on
conditions at the low-temperature, rather than high-temperature, part of the
loop. We also establish regimes in temperature and density space in which each
of the applicable scaling laws prevail.

by taking advantages of quantum properties. In many scenarios, precision is not
the sole target; the acquired information must be protected once it is
generated in the sensing process. Considering a remote sensing scenario where a
local site performs cooperative sensing with a remote site to collect private
information at the remote site, the loss of sensing data inevitably causes
private information to be revealed. Quantum key distribution is known to be a
reliable solution for secure data transmission, however, it fails if an
eavesdropper accesses the sensing data generated at a remote site. In this
study, we demonstrate that by sharing entanglement between local and remote
sites, secure quantum remote sensing can be realized, and the secure level is
characterized by asymmetric Fisher information gain. Concretely, only the local
site can acquire the estimated parameter accurately with Fisher information
approaching 1. In contrast, the accessible Fisher information for an
eavesdropper is nearly zero even if he/she obtains the raw sensing data at the
remote site. This achievement is primarily due to the nonlocal calibration and
steering of the probe state at the remote site. Our results explore one

and detection scheme is first proposed for massive MIMO networks, where each
uplink frame is divided into a number of data blocks with independent coding
schemes and the following blocks are decoded based on previously detected data
blocks in both service and neighboring cells. The asymptotic
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of the proposed scheme is then
derived, and the distribution of interference power considering the randomness
of the users' locations is proved to be Gaussian. By tracking the mean and
variance of interference power, an online robust rate adaptation algorithm
ensuring a target packet outage probability is proposed for the scenario where
the interfering channel and the user density are unknown.

demonstrate that highly accurate BNNs can be trained from scratch with a simple
training strategy. We propose a new BNN architecture BinaryDenseNet, which
significantly surpasses all existing 1-bit CNNs on ImageNet without tricks. In

shadowing of the outer disc from the (sub grid) inner disc Compton heated

after the spectral transition to the hard state leads to strong suppression of
the wind. Thermal-radiative winds explain all of the spectral features (and
their disappearance) in this simplest wind system and magnetic winds play only
a minor role. We speculate that thermal-radiative winds can explain all the

under-resourced code-switched (CS) speech in multiple South African languages.
We consider two approaches. The first constructs separate bilingual acoustic
models corresponding to language pairs (English-isiZulu, English-isiXhosa,
English-Setswana and English-Sesotho). The second constructs a single unified
five-lingual acoustic model representing all the languages (English, isiZulu,
isiXhosa, Setswana and Sesotho). For these two approaches we consider the
effectiveness of semi-supervised training to increase the size of the very
sparse acoustic training sets. Using approximately 11 hours of untranscribed
speech, we show that both approaches benefit from semi-supervised training. The
bilingual TDNN-F acoustic models also benefit from the addition of CNN layers
(CNN-TDNN-F), while the five-lingual system does not show any significant
improvement. Furthermore, because English is common to all language pairs in
our data, it dominates when training a unified language model, leading to
improved English ASR performance at the expense of the other languages.
Nevertheless, the five-lingual model offers flexibility because it can process
more than two languages simultaneously, and is therefore an attractive option
as an automatic transcription system in a semi-supervised training pipeline.

sequence progression. Events in violation of their occurrence probability are
identified as abnormal. We also introduce a visualization system, EventThread3,
to support interactive exploration and interpretations of anomalies within the
context of normal sequence progressions in the dataset through comprehensive
one-to-many sequence comparison. Finally, we quantitatively evaluate the
performance of our anomaly detection algorithm and demonstrate the
effectiveness of our system through a case study.

representations, which characterize the distribution over the latent states in

latent variable models, and shown to be effective for reinforcement learning in
POMDPs. In this work, we investigate the belief representation learning problem
for generative adversarial imitation learning in POMDPs. Instead of training
the belief module and the policy separately as suggested in prior work, we
learn the belief module jointly with the policy, using a task-aware imitation
loss to ensure that the representation is more aligned with the policy's
objective. To improve robustness of representation, we introduce several
informative belief regularization techniques, including multi-step prediction
of dynamics and action-sequences. Evaluated on various partially observable
continuous-control locomotion tasks, our belief-module imitation learning
approach (BMIL) substantially outperforms several baselines, including the
original GAIL algorithm and the task-agnostic belief learning algorithm.
Extensive ablation analysis indicates the effectiveness of task-aware belief

than consider using geodesics in $\R^n$, which are straight lines, we consider
an induced flow using geodesics between the tangent spaces of the hypersurfaces
viewed as affine hyperplanes. For naturality, we want the geodesic flow to be
invariant under rigid transformations and homotheties. Consequently, we do not
use the dual projective space, as the geodesic flow in this space is not
preserved under translations. Instead we give an alternate approach using a
Lorentzian space, which is semi-Riemannian with a metric of index $1$. For this
space for points corresponding to affine hyperplanes in $\R^n$, we give a
formula for the geodesic between two such points. As a consequence, we show the
geodesic flow is preserved by rigid transformations and homotheties of $\R^n$.
Furthermore, we give a criterion that a vector field in a smoothly varying
family of hyperplanes along a curve yields a Lorentzian parallel vector field
for the corresponding curve in the Lorentzian space. As a result this provides
a method to extend an orthogonal frame in one affine hyperplane to a smoothly

hyperplanes along a smooth curve, as well as a interpolating between two such
frames with a smooth "" minimally Lorentzian varying"" family of orthogonal

present each multimedia item with a key frame image (e.g., the poster of a
movie). As each multimedia item can be represented as multiple fine-grained
visual images (e.g., related images of the movie), personalized key frame
recommendation is necessary in these applications to attract users' unique
visual preferences. However, previous personalized key frame recommendation
models relied on users' fine-grained image behavior of multimedia items (e.g.,
user-image interaction behavior), which is often not available in real
scenarios. In this paper, we study the general problem of joint multimedia item
and key frame recommendation in the absence of the fine-grained user-image
behavior. We argue that the key challenge of this problem lies in discovering
users' visual profiles for key frame recommendation, as most recommendation
models would fail without any users' fine-grained image behavior. To tackle
this challenge, we leverage users' item behavior by projecting users (items) in
two latent spaces: a collaborative latent space and a visual latent space. We
further design a model to discern both the collaborative and visual dimensions
of users, and model how users make decisive item preferences from these two
spaces. As a result, the learned user visual profiles could be directly applied
for key frame recommendation. Finally, experimental results on a real-world
dataset clearly show the effectiveness of our proposed model on the two
recommendation tasks.

All these results assume that the manifolds and bundles involved carry a Spin

There exist an alternative to adapt this result to SpinC manifolds, where the
idea is to use the left regular representation of a Clifford algebra in itself

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). The students that finished successfully this
course participated in twelve short workshops, based on a flipped classroom
model. Each workshop focused on a specific HCI activity, while before the
workshops, a two-hour lecture was used to introduce the students in the flipped
learning concept. All the rest of the educational material was offered to the
students online before each workshop. Such material was mainly short lectures
from the professor, in the form of videos uploaded in the course's YouTube
channel and documents delivered using the university learning management system
(LMS). For each workshop the students had to be prepared to participate, which
was tested using brief quizzes before the start of specific workshops. The
activity presented in this paper was the design and evaluation of an
interactive system. The students were asked to form six groups comprising of
three to four students each. Then a system's description, vague enough to
stimulate creativity, was randomly assigned to each group. This activity
presented in this paper was the longest activity of the entire course and it
was conducted in four consequent workshops. The paper presents the setting of
this experiment, the peer assessment method and the use of eye-tracking data
collected and analysed to aid the students towards improving their design. The
students created a working model of the system with limited functionality and
improved this model using eye-tracking data from the peer evaluation of this
model. The use of these data offered them the insight to improve their models
and to undergo design changes. The paper presents samples of the progress made
between various versions of the models and concludes presenting the preliminary
positive results of the students qualitative evaluation of this experiment.

models are successful across a diverse set of NLP tasks, suggesting that they
encode useful and transferable features of language. To shed light on the
linguistic knowledge they capture, we study the representations produced by
several recent pretrained contextualizers (variants of ELMo, the OpenAI
transformer language model, and BERT) with a suite of seventeen diverse probing
tasks. We find that linear models trained on top of frozen contextual
representations are competitive with state-of-the-art task-specific models in
many cases, but fail on tasks requiring fine-grained linguistic knowledge
(e.g., conjunct identification). To investigate the transferability of
contextual word representations, we quantify differences in the transferability
of individual layers within contextualizers, especially between recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) and transformers. For instance, higher layers of RNNs
are more task-specific, while transformer layers do not exhibit the same
monotonic trend. In addition, to better understand what makes contextual word
representations transferable, we compare language model pretraining with eleven
supervised pretraining tasks. For any given task, pretraining on a closely
related task yields better performance than language model pretraining (which
is better on average) when the pretraining dataset is fixed. However, language
model pretraining on more data gives the best results.

  Coaxial Dual-Nozzle Electrospinning as Battery Separators","Lithium-ion batteries have attracted enormous interests recently as promising
power sources. However, the safety issue associated with the employment of
highly flammable liquid electrolyte impedes the further development of
next-generation lithium-ion batteries. Recently, researchers reported the use
of electrospun core-shell fiber as the battery separator consisting of polymer
layer as protective shell and flame retardants loaded inside as core. In case
of a typical battery shorting, the protective polymer shell melts during
thermal-runaway and the flame retardants inside would be released to suppress
the combustion of the electrolyte. Due to the use of a single precursor
solution for electrospinning containing both polymer and flame retardants, the
weight ratio of flame retardants is limited and dependent. Herein, we developed
a dual-nozzle, coaxial electrospinning approach to fabricate the core-shell
nanofiber with a greatly enhanced flame retardants weight percentage in the
final fibers. The weight ratio of flame retardants of triphenyl phosphate in
the final composite reaches over 60 wt.%. The LiFePO4-based cell using this
composite nanofiber as battery separator exhibits excellent flame-retardant
property without compromising the cycling stability or rate performances. In
addition, this functional nanofiber can also be coated onto commercial
separators instead of being used directly as separators.

many network applications. Emerging software defined networking and cloud
computing need to update the rulesets frequently for flexible policy
configuration. Their success depends on the availability of the new generation
of classifiers that can support both fast ruleset updating and high-speed
packet classification. However, existing packet classification approaches focus
either on high-speed packet classification or fast rule update, but no known
scheme meets both requirements. In this paper, we propose Range-vector Hash
(RVH) to effectively accelerate the packet classification with a hash-based
algorithm while ensuring the fast rule update. RVH is built on our key
observation that the number of distinct combinations of each field prefix
lengths is not evenly distributed. To reduce the number of hash tables for fast
classification, we introduce a novel concept range-vector with each specified
the length range of each field prefix of the projected rules. RVH can overcome
the major obstacle that hinders hash-based packet classification by balancing
the number of hash tables and the probability of hash collision. Experimental
results demonstrate that RVH can achieve the classification speed up to 15.7
times and the update speed up to 2.3 times that of the state-of-the-art
algorithms on average, while only consuming 44% less memory.

mobility datasets are restricted to geospatial information obtained through a
single sensor at low spatiotemporal granularities. Furthermore, this passively
collected data lacks ground-truth information regarding points of interest and
their semantic labels. These features are critical in order to push the
possibilities of geospatial data analysis towards analyzing mobility behaviors
and movement patterns at a fine-grained scale. To this end, Breadcrumbs
provides ground-truth and semantic labels for the points of interest of all the
participants. The dataset also contains fine-grained demographic attributes,

on the fly. The key of such algorithms is an unbiased estimation of gradients,
which is often (trivially) achieved by uniformly sampling from the entire
parameter space. This unfortunately introduces high-variance in gradient
estimation, and leads to a worse regret of model estimation, especially when
the dimension of parameter space is large.
  In this paper, we aim at reducing the variance of gradient estimation in OL2R
algorithms. We project the selected updating direction into a space spanned by
the feature vectors from examined documents under the current query (termed the
""document space"" for short), after interleaved test. Our key insight is that
the result of interleaved test solely is governed by a user's relevance
evaluation over the examined documents. Hence, the true gradient introduced by
this test result should lie in the constructed document space, and components
orthogonal to the document space in the proposed gradient can be safely removed
for variance reduction. We prove that the projected gradient is an unbiased
estimation of the true gradient, and show that this lower-variance gradient
estimation results in significant regret reduction. Our proposed method is
compatible with all existing OL2R algorithms which rank documents using a
linear model. Extensive experimental comparisons with several state-of-the-art
OL2R algorithms have confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed method in
reducing the variance of gradient estimation and improving overall performance.

  Survey (MANOS): Taxonomic dependence on asteroid size","The Mission Accessible Near-Earth Object Survey (MANOS) aims to observe and
characterize small (mean absolute magnitude H ~ 25 mag) Near-Earth Objects
(NEOs) that are accessible by spacecraft (mean $\Delta v$ ~ 5.7 km/s) and that
make close approaches with the Earth (mean Minimum Orbital Intersection
Distance MOID ~ 0.03 AU). We present here the first results of the MANOS
visible spectroscopic survey. The spectra were obtained from August 2013 to
March 2018 at Lowell Observatory's Discovery Channel 4.3 meter telescope, and
both Gemini North and South facilities. In total, 210 NEOs have been observed
and taxonomically classified. Our taxonomic distribution shows significant
variations with respect to surveys of larger objects. We suspect these to be
due to a dependence of Main Belt source regions on object size. Compared to
previous surveys of larger objects (Binzel et al. 2019, 2004; Perna et al.
2018), we report a lower fraction of S+Q-complex asteroids of 43.8 $\pm$ 4.6%.
We associate this decrease with a lack of Phocaea family members at very small
size. We also report higher fractions of X-complex and A-type asteroids of 23.8
$\pm$ 3.3% and 3.8 $\pm$ 1.3% respectively due to an increase of Hungaria
family objects at small size. We find a strong correlation between the Q/S
ratio and perihelion distance. We suggest this correlation is due to planetary
close encounters with Venus playing a major role in turning asteroids from S to
Q-type. This hypothesis is supported by a similar correlation between the Q/S
ratio and Venus MOID.

  Taylor Series Expansion","This paper compares two basic approaches to solving ordinary differential
equations, which form the basis for attitude computation in strapdown inertial
navigation systems, namely, the Taylor series expansion approach that was used
in its low-order form for deriving all mainstream algorithms and the functional
iterative integration approach developed recently. They are respectively
applied to solve the kinematic equations of major attitude parameters,
including the quaternion, the Rodrigues vector and the rotation vector.
Specifically, the mainstream algorithms, which have relied on the simplified
rotation vector without exception, are considerably extended by the Taylor
series expansion approach using the exact rotation vector and recursive
calculation of high-order derivatives. The functional iterative integration
approach is respectively implemented on both the normal polynomial and the
Chebyshev polynomial. Numerical results under the classical coning motion are
reported to assess all derived attitude algorithms. It is revealed that in the
relative frequency range when the coning to sampling frequency ratio is below
0.05-0.1 (depending on the chosen polynomial truncation order), all algorithms
have the same order of accuracy if the same number of samples are used to fit
the angular velocity over the iteration interval; in the range of higher
relative frequency, the group of Quat/Rod/RotFIter algorithms (by the
functional iterative integration approach combined with the Chebyshev
polynomial) perform the best in both accuracy and robustness, thanks to the
excellent numerical stability and powerful functional representation capability
of the Chebyshev polynomial.

  leading to actions in simulated agents","An agent's actions can be influenced by external factors through the inputs
it receives from the environment, as well as internal factors, such as memories
or intrinsic preferences. The extent to which an agent's actions are ""caused
from within"", as opposed to being externally driven, should depend on its
sensor capacity as well as environmental demands for memory and
context-dependent behavior. Here, we test this hypothesis using simulated
agents (""animats""), equipped with small adaptive Markov Brains (MB) that evolve
to solve a perceptual-categorization task under conditions varied with regards
to the agents' sensor capacity and task difficulty. Using a novel formalism
developed to identify and quantify the actual causes of occurrences (""what
caused what?"") in complex networks, we evaluate the direct causes of the
animats' actions. In addition, we extend this framework to trace the causal
chain (""causes of causes"") leading to an animat's actions back in time, and
compare the obtained spatio-temporal causal history across task conditions. We
found that measures quantifying the extent to which an animat's actions are
caused by internal factors (as opposed to being driven by the environment
through its sensors) varied consistently with defining aspects of the task
conditions they evolved to thrive in.

  ferrimagnetic alloys","Skyrmions can be stabilized in magnetic systems with broken inversion
symmetry and chiral interactions, such as Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions
(DMI). Further, compensation of magnetic moments in ferrimagnetic materials can
significantly reduce magnetic dipolar interactions, which tend to favor large
skyrmions. Tuning DMI is essential to control skyrmion properties, with
symmetry breaking at interfaces offering the greatest flexibility. However, in
contrast to the ferromagnet case, few studies have investigated interfacial DMI
in ferrimagnets. Here we present a systematic study of DMI in ferrimagnetic
CoGd films by Brillouin light scattering. We demonstrate the ability to control
DMI by the CoGd cap layer composition, the stack symmetry and the ferrimagnetic
layer thickness. The DMI thickness dependence confirms its interfacial nature.
In addition, magnetic force microscopy reveals the ability to tune DMI in a
range that stabilizes sub-100 nm skyrmions at room temperature in zero field.
Our work opens new paths for controlling interfacial DMI in ferrimagnets to
nucleate and manipulate skyrmions.

is crucial for many applications. Device-independent randomness generation
(DIRNG) allows new randomness to be provably generated, without needing to
trust the devices used for the protocol. This provides strong guarantees about
the security of the output, but comes at the price of requiring the violation
of a Bell inequality to implement. A further challenge is to make the bounds in
the security proofs tight enough to allow expansion with contemporary
technology. Thus, while randomness has been generated in recent experiments,
the amount of randomness consumed in doing so has been too high to certify
expansion based on existing theory. Here we present an experiment that
demonstrates device-independent randomness expansion (DIRNE), i.e., where the
generated randomness surpasses that consumed. By developing a loophole-free
Bell test setup with a single photon detection efficiency of around 81% and
exploiting a spot-checking protocol, we achieve a net gain of $2.63\times10^8$
certified bits with soundness error $5.74\times10^{-8}$. The experiment ran for
220 hours corresponding to an average rate of randomness generation of 8202
bits/s. By developing the Entropy Accumulation Theorem (EAT), we established
security against quantum adversaries. We anticipate that this work will lead to
further improvements that push device-independence towards commercial

energy consumption. For this purpose, over the last decade, a vast number of ND
protocols have been proposed, which have progressively reduced the relation
between the time within which discovery is guaranteed and the energy
consumption. In spite of the simplicity of the problem statement, even after
more than 10 years of research on this specific topic, new solutions are still
proposed even today. Despite the large number of known ND protocols, given an
energy budget, what is the best achievable latency still remains unclear. This
paper addresses this question and for the first time presents safe and tight,
duty-cycle-dependent bounds on the worst-case discovery latency that no ND
protocol can beat. Surprisingly, several existing protocols are indeed optimal,
which has not been known until now. We conclude that there is no further
potential to improve the relation between latency and duty-cycle, but future ND
protocols can improve their robustness against beacon collisions.

clean $\pm 0.3\%$ determination of the CKM matrix element $V_{\text{ud}}$. That
value falls short of super-allowed nuclear beta decays where an order of
magnitude better precision already exists. We advocate a new strategy for
utilizing pion beta decay, based on its role in determining ${V_{\text{us}} /
V_{\text{ud}}}$ via the ratio $R_V=\Gamma\left(K\to \pi l
\nu(\gamma)\right)/\Gamma\left(\pi^+\to \pi^0 e^+\nu(\gamma)\right)$. $R_V$
measures $ { f_+^K(0) |V_{\text{us}}| / f_+^\pi(0) |V_{\text{ud}}| }$ and is
insensitive to the Fermi constant and some radiative corrections. Its
dependence on the ratio of form factors may also prove useful for lattice gauge
theory calculations. Employing a lattice based value ${ f_+^K(0) / f_+^\pi(0) }
= 0.970(2)$, we find $V_{\text{us}}/V_{\text{ud}}=0.22918(88)$ compared to

While many studies have been conducted to understand this relationship, little
is known about the relationship between eating environments and health. Yet
researchers and health agencies around the world have recognized the eating
environment as a promising context for improving diet and health. In this
paper, we propose an image clustering method to automatically extract the
eating environments from eating occasion images captured during a community
dwelling dietary study. Specifically, we are interested in learning how many
different environments an individual consumes food in. Our method clusters
images by extracting features at both global and local scales using a deep
neural network. The variation in the number of clusters and images captured by
different individual makes this a very challenging problem. Experimental
results show that our method performs significantly better compared to several
existing clustering approaches.

  Problem for Urban Warehouses","The recent rising popularity of ultra-fast delivery services on retail
platforms fuels the increasing use of urban warehouses, whose proximity to
customers makes fast deliveries viable. The space limit in urban warehouses
poses a problem for the online retailers: the number of products (SKUs) they
carry is no longer ""the more, the better"", yet it can still be significantly
large, reaching hundreds or thousands in a product category. In this paper, we
study algorithms for dynamically identifying a large number of products (i.e.,
SKUs) with top customer purchase probabilities on the fly, from an ocean of
potential products to offer on retailers' ultra-fast delivery platforms.
  We distill the product selection problem into a semi-bandit model with linear
generalization. There are in total $N$ different arms, each with a feature
vector of dimension $d$. The player pulls $K$ arms in each period and observes
the bandit feedback from each of the pulled arms. We focus on the setting where
$K$ is much greater than the number of total time periods $T$ or the dimension
of product features $d$. We first analyze a standard UCB algorithm and show its
regret bound can be expressed as the sum of a $T$-independent part $\tilde O(K
d^{3/2})$ and a $T$-dependent part $\tilde O(d\sqrt{KT})$, which we refer to as
""fixed cost"" and ""variable cost"" respectively. To reduce the fixed cost for
large $K$ values, we propose a novel online learning algorithm, which
iteratively shrinks the upper confidence bounds within each period, and show
its fixed cost is reduced by a factor of $d$ to $\tilde O(K \sqrt{d})$.
Moreover, we test the algorithms on an industrial dataset from Alibaba Group.
Experimental results show that our new algorithm reduces the total regret of
the standard UCB algorithm by at least 10%.

  Projections for Smooth Convex Minimization over Trace-Norm Balls and Related
  Problems","Smooth convex minimization over the unit trace-norm ball is an important
optimization problem in machine learning, signal processing, statistics and
other fields, that underlies many tasks in which one wishes to recover a
low-rank matrix given certain measurements. While first-order methods for
convex optimization enjoy optimal convergence rates, they require in worst-case
to compute a full-rank SVD on each iteration, in order to compute the
projection onto the trace-norm ball. These full-rank SVD computations however
prohibit the application of such methods to large problems. A simple and
natural heuristic to reduce the computational cost is to approximate the
projection using only a low-rank SVD. This raises the question if, and under
what conditions, this simple heuristic can indeed result in provable
convergence to the optimal solution. In this paper we show that any optimal
solution is a center of a Euclid. ball inside-which the projected-gradient
mapping admits rank that is at most the multiplicity of the largest singular
value of the gradient vector. Moreover, the radius of the ball scales with the
spectral gap of this gradient vector. We show how this readily implies the
local convergence (i.e., from a ""warm-start"" initialization) of standard
first-order methods, using only low-rank SVD computations. We also quantify the
effect of ""over-parameterization"", i.e., using SVD computations with higher
rank, on the radius of this ball, showing it can increase dramatically with
moderately larger rank. We extend our results also to the setting of
optimization with trace-norm regularization and optimization over bounded-trace
positive semidefinite matrices. Our theoretical investigation is supported by
concrete empirical evidence that demonstrates the \textit{correct} convergence
of first-order methods with low-rank projections on real-world datasets.

atomic vibrations, whose microscopic dynamics is well described by the
linearized phonon Boltzmann transport equation. Recently, it was shown that
thermal conductivity can be resolved exactly and in a closed form as a sum over
relaxons, $\mathit{i.e.}$ collective phonon excitations that are the
eigenvectors of Boltzmann equation's scattering matrix [Cepellotti and Marzari,
PRX $\mathbf{6}$ (2016)]. Relaxons have a well-defined parity, and only odd
relaxons contribute to the thermal conductivity. Here, we show that the
complementary set of even relaxons determines another quantity --- the thermal
viscosity --- that enters into the description of heat transport, and is
especially relevant in the hydrodynamic regime, where dissipation of crystal
momentum by Umklapp scattering phases out. We also show how the thermal
conductivity and viscosity parametrize two novel viscous heat equations --- two
coupled equations for the temperature and drift-velocity fields --- which
represent the thermal counterpart of the Navier-Stokes equations of
hydrodynamics in the linear, laminar regime. These viscous heat equations are
derived from a coarse-graining of the linearized Boltzmann transport equation
for phonons, and encompass both limits of Fourier's law and of second sound,
taking place, respectively, in the regimes of strong or weak momentum
dissipation. Last, we introduce the Fourier deviation number as a descriptor
that captures the deviations from Fourier's law due to hydrodynamic effects. We
showcase these findings in a test case of a complex-shaped device made of
graphite, obtaining a remarkable agreement with the very recent experimental
demonstration of hydrodynamic transport in this material. The present findings
also suggest that hydrodynamic behavior can appear at room temperature in

its distance to the singularity loci while the motion is being smoothed. In our

solution for the local exterma of the singularity distance function. Formally
this process is called variational path optimization which is the systematic

some physical limits of the mechanical joints are also taken into account.

one-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) through a novel
algorithm--Amplitude Retrieval (AR). Unlike the state-of-the-art methods such
as those based on one-bit compressive sensing, AR takes a different approach.
It accounts for the lost amplitudes of the one-bit quantized measurements, and
performs channel estimation and amplitude completion jointly. This way, the
direction information of the propagation paths can be estimated via accurate
direction finding algorithms in array processing, e.g., maximum likelihood. The
upsot is that AR is able to handle off-grid angles and provide more accurate
channel estimates. Simulation results are included to showcase the advantages
of AR.

results of this article supplement those in the three main papers on random

  To start, we study the limit profile of cutoff for the simple random walk on

onto discussing material from our companion paper on matrix groups. We then
study distance of a typical element of $G$ from the identity in an $L_q$-type
graph distance in the Abelian set-up. Finally, we give necessary and sufficient
conditions for $k$ independent uniform elements of $G$ to generate $G$, ie for
the random Cayley graph to be connected, based on work of Pomerance (2001).

standard non-parametric wide-pass filters, i.e., 1D convolutions, to extract
the most relevant spectro-temporal patterns while gradually compressing the
structured high dimensional representation generated by the parametric block.
We rely on a probabilistic parametrization of the proposed architecture and
learn the model using stochastic variational inference. This requires
evaluation of an analytically intractable integral defining the
Kullback-Leibler divergence term responsible for regularization, for which we
propose an effective approximation based on the Gauss-Hermite quadrature. Our
empirical results demonstrate a superior performance of the proposed approach

robustness. Moreover, the approach outperforms a recently proposed deep

to above 400 K in the tensely strained MnAs nanocrystals. This finding is
corroborated by the state of the art transmission electron microscopy,
sensitive magnetometry and the first-principles calculations. The effect relies
in defining a nanotube geometry of molecular beam epitaxy grown core-multishell
wurtzite (Ga,In)As/(Ga,Al)As/(Ga,Mn)As/GaAs nanowires where the MnAs
nanocrystals are formed during the thermal-treatment-induced phase separation
of wurtzite (Ga,Mn)As into the GaAs:MnAs granular system. Such a unique
combination of two types of hexagonal lattices provides possibility of
attaining quasi-hydrostatic tensile strain in MnAs (impossible otherwise),
leading to the substantial ferromagnetic phase transition temperature increase
in this compound.

  Energy-Based Model","This paper studies a curious phenomenon in learning energy-based model (EBM)
using MCMC. In each learning iteration, we generate synthesized examples by
running a non-convergent, non-mixing, and non-persistent short-run MCMC toward
the current model, always starting from the same initial distribution such as
uniform noise distribution, and always running a fixed number of MCMC steps.
After generating synthesized examples, we then update the model parameters
according to the maximum likelihood learning gradient, as if the synthesized
examples are fair samples from the current model. We treat this non-convergent
short-run MCMC as a learned generator model or a flow model. We provide
arguments for treating the learned non-convergent short-run MCMC as a valid
model. We show that the learned short-run MCMC is capable of generating
realistic images. More interestingly, unlike traditional EBM or MCMC, the
learned short-run MCMC is capable of reconstructing observed images and
interpolating between images, like generator or flow models. The code can be
found in the Appendix.

bandwidth is shared. Since increased number of requests from multiple cores of
processors becomes a source of bottleneck, scheduling the requests efficiently
is necessary to utilize all the computing power these processors offer.
However, current multicore processors are using traditional memory controllers,
which are designed for single-core processors. They are unable to adapt to
changing characteristics of memory workloads that run simultaneously on
multiple cores. Existing schedulers may disrupt locality and bank parallelism
among data requests coming from different cores. Hence, novel memory
controllers that consider and adapt to the memory access characteristics, and
share memory resources efficiently and fairly are necessary. We introduce
Core-Aware Dynamic Scheduler (CADS) for multicore memory controller. CADS uses
Reinforcement Learning (RL) to alter its scheduling strategy dynamically at
runtime. Our scheduler utilizes locality among data requests from multiple
cores and exploits parallelism in accessing multiple banks of DRAM. CADS is
also able to share the DRAM while guaranteeing fairness to all cores accessing
memory. Using CADS policy, we achieve 20% better cycles per instruction (CPI)
in running memory intensive and compute intensive PARSEC parallel benchmarks

  structure in hot medium from a chiral quark-meson theory?","In this contribution I summarize and discuss the results of the bulk
thermodynamic characteristics, meson and nucleon structure in hot matter
obtained in the framework of a chiral quark-meson theory. A hybrid NJL model is
used in which a Dirac sea of quarks is combined with a Fermi sea of quarks or
of nucleons. In the model mesons are described as collective $\bar qq$
excitations and the nucleon appears as a baryon-number-one soliton of $N_c$
valence quarks coupled to both Dirac and Fermi sea. According to the model at
some critical density and/or temperature phase transitions from nucleons to
quarks as well as from Goldstone to Wigner phase are expected. At finite
density the chiral order parameter and the constituent quark mass have a
non-monotonic temperature dependence-at temperatures not close to the critical
one they are less affected than in cold matter. The quark matter is rather soft
against thermal fluctuations and the corresponding chiral phase transition is
smooth. The nucleon matter is much stiffer and the phase transition is very
sharp. In the case of quark matter a first-order transition is suggested at low
temperatures ($T<80$ MeV) which changes to a second-order one at higher
temperatures. In contrast to the quark matter in the case of nucleon matter the
thermodynamic variables show large discontinuities which is a clear indication
for a first-order phase transition. In hot medium at intermediate temperature
the nucleon soliton is more bound and less swelled than in the case of cold
matter. At some critical temperature, which for nucleon matter coincides with
the critical temperature for the phase transition, no more a localized solution
is found. According to this model scenario one should expect a first-order
phase transition from nucleon to quark matter.

  Metastases: A Multi-Center Study","The purpose was to assess the clinical value of a novel DropOut model for
detecting and segmenting brain metastases, in which a neural network is trained
on four distinct MRI sequences using an input dropout layer, thus simulating
the scenario of missing MRI data by training on the full set and all possible
subsets of the input data. This retrospective, multi-center study, evaluated
165 patients with brain metastases. A deep learning based segmentation model
for automatic segmentation of brain metastases, named DropOut, was trained on
multi-sequence MRI from 100 patients, and validated/tested on 10/55 patients.
The segmentation results were compared with the performance of a
state-of-the-art DeepLabV3 model. The MR sequences in the training set included
pre- and post-gadolinium (Gd) T1-weighted 3D fast spin echo, post-Gd
T1-weighted inversion recovery (IR) prepped fast spoiled gradient echo, and 3D
fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), whereas the test set did not
include the IR prepped image-series. The ground truth were established by
experienced neuroradiologists. The results were evaluated using precision,
recall, Dice score, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve
statistics, while the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the
performance of the two neural networks. The area under the ROC curve (AUC),
averaged across all test cases, was 0.989+-0.029 for the DropOut model and
0.989+-0.023 for the DeepLabV3 model (p=0.62). The DropOut model showed a
significantly higher Dice score compared to the DeepLabV3 model (0.795+-0.105
vs. 0.774+-0.104, p=0.017), and a significantly lower average false positive
rate of 3.6/patient vs. 7.0/patient (p<0.001) using a 10mm3 lesion-size limit.
The DropOut model may facilitate accurate detection and segmentation of brain
metastases on a multi-center basis, even when the test cohort is missing MRI
input data.

superconductivity in transition metal dichalcogenides, whereas the ratio
T_c/T_F is approximately a factor of 20 lower than the ratio observed in
hole-doped cuprates. We, furthermore, find that the values of the
superconducting gaps are insensitive to the suppression of the
quasi-two-dimensional CDW state, indicating that the CDW ordering and the

identifying potential vulnerabilities and inefficiencies before crises occur.
However, given the complexity of transportation networks, as well as the
diversity of ways in which systems can fail, the problem of assessing the
impacts of exceptional phenomena still lacks tools and metrics for analysis.
Therefore, this paper aims to present a method for assessing the behavior of
road networks during crises in which segments are disabled or unusable for a
time. The method proposed was structured around two metrics calculated from the
road network and trip distribution: network continuity and efficiency of
alternative. With these metrics, we assess, as an example, the local and global
impacts of various flooding scenarios in a case study at S\~ao Carlos, a
medium-sized Brazilian city in the state of S\~ao Paulo. Our findings indicate
that pedestrian movements are significantly less impacted than motorized
vehicles by floods in the city, which may be due to the car-oriented nature of
the avenues closest to rivers, and the shortest average length of pedestrian
trips. These findings and metrics set a framework for further research
involving other cities and natural phenomena to enrich the understanding of
resilience in urban transportation networks.

molecular oxygen in the coma of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko with abundances
at the 1-10% level relative to H2O. Previous studies have indicated that the
likely origin of the O2 may be surface chemistry of primordial (dark cloud)
origin, requiring somewhat warmer, denser and extreme H-atom poor conditions
than are usually assumed. In this study we propose a primordial gas-phase
origin for the O2 which is subsequently frozen and effectively hidden until the
ice mantles are sublimated in the comet's coma. Our study presents results from
a three-phase astrochemical model that simulates the chemical evolution of ices
in the primordial dark cloud phase, its gravitational collapse, and evolution
in the early protosolar nebula. We find that the O2 abundance can be produced
and is fairly robust to the choice of the free parameters. Good matches for the
O2:H2O ratio and, to a lesser extent, the N2:CO and CO:H2O ratios are obtained,
but the models significantly over-produce N2. We speculate that the low value
of N2:O2 that is observed is a consequence of the specific thermal history of
the comet.

in fixed dimensional time series that the asymptotic error of change-point

dynamics in a two-fluid system, where the viscous fluid is incompressible at a

inevitable. By using Loewner-Kufarev equation, we study interface dynamics
generated by nonlocal random Loewner measure, which produces the patterns with
viscous fingers. We use a Schottky double construction to introduce a
one-parametric family of functions of random processes on the double closely
connected to the correlation functions of primary operators of the boundary
conformal field theory in the Coulomb gas framework. For a specific value of
the parameter, these functions are martingales with respect to stochastic
Loewner flow on the Schottky double. A connection between the proposed
algebraic construction and the physical problem of stochastic interface
dynamics relies on the Hadamard's variational formula. Namely, the variation of
pressure in stochastic Laplacian growth near the interface is given by the
covariance of martingales on the double.

information propagation in the body. In embryogenesis the interplay between
Ca2+ signalling and mechanical forces is critical to the healthy development of
an embryo but poorly understood. Several types of embryonic cells exhibit
calcium-induced contractions and many experiments indicate that Ca2+ signals
and contractions are coupled via a two-way mechanochemical coupling. We present
a new analysis of experimental data that supports the existence of this
coupling during Apical Constriction in Neural Tube Closure. We then propose a
mechanochemical model, building on early models that couple Ca2+ dynamics to
cell mechanics and replace the bistable Ca2+ release with modern,
experimentally validated Ca2+ dynamics. We assume that the cell is a linear
viscoelastic material and model the Ca2+-induced contraction stress with a Hill
function saturating at high Ca2+ levels. We also express, for the first time,
the ""stretch-activation"" Ca2+ flux in the early mechanochemical models as a
bottom-up contribution from stretch-sensitive Ca2+ channels on the cell
membrane. We reduce the model to three ordinary differential equations and
analyse its bifurcation structure semi-analytically as the $IP_3$
concentration, and the ""strength"" of stretch activation, $\lambda$ vary. The
Ca2+ system ($\lambda=0$, no mechanics) exhibits relaxation oscillations for a
certain range of $IP_3$ values. As $\lambda$ is increased the range of $IP_3$
values decreases, the oscillation amplitude decreases and the frequency
increases. Oscillations vanish for a sufficiently high value of $\lambda$.
These results agree with experiments in embryonic cells that also link the loss
of Ca2+ oscillations to embryo abnormalities. The work addresses a very
important and understudied question on the coupling of chemical and mechanical
signalling in embryogenesis.

occurs naturally when the underlying random field is periodic. We show that a

ionized-gas disks smoothly coupled with their outer HI disks, 7 galaxies reveal
circumnuclear polar ionized-gas disks, and in NGC 2551 the ionized gas though
confined to the main galactic plane however counterrotates the stellar
component. The ionized-gas excitation analysis reveals the gas ionization by
young stars in 12 of 18 S0 galaxies studied here; the current star formation in
these galaxies is confined to the ring-like zones coinciding with the UV-rings.
The gas oxygen abundance estimates in the rings are closely concentrated around
the value of 0.7 $Z_\odot$ and do not correlate either with the ring radius nor
with the metallicity of the underlying stellar population. By applying the
tilted-ring analysis to the 2D velocity fields of the ionized gas, we have
traced the orientation of the gas rotation-plane lines of nodes along the

the gas lies strictly in the stellar disk planes and rotates there circularly;
the sense of the gas rotation does not matter (the counterrotating gas in NGC

formation the extended gaseous disks are either in steady-state quasi-polar

considering a vanishing vertical viscosity limit, we apply a direct approach
which in particular avoids unnecessary boundary conditions on top and bottom.
For the initial value problem, we obtain existence and uniqueness of local
$z$-weak solutions for initial data in $H^1((-h,h),L^2(G))$ and local strong
solutions for initial data in $H^1(\Omega)$. If $v_0\in H^1((-h,h),L^2(G))$,
$\partial_z v_0\in L^q(\Omega)$ for $q>2$, then the $z$-weak solution
regularizes instantaneously and thus extends to a global strong solution. This
goes beyond the global well-posedness result by Cao, Li and Titi (J. Func.
Anal. 272(11): 4606-4641, 2017) for initial data near $H^1$ in the periodic
setting. For the time-periodic problem, existence and uniqueness of $z$-weak
and strong time periodic solutions is proven for small forces. %These solutions
are in the set of solutions with small norms. Since this is a model with
hyperbolic and parabolic features for which classical results are not directly
applicable, such results for the time-periodic problem even for small forces
are not self-evident.

implications this poses is becoming a major concern in modern society. Given
the enormous amount of content created every day, automatic methods are
required to detect and deal with this type of content. Until now, most of the

problem is multilingual.
  We construct a Danish dataset containing user-generated comments from
\textit{Reddit} and \textit{Facebook}. It contains user generated comments from
various social media platforms, and to our knowledge, it is the first of its
kind. Our dataset is annotated to capture various types and target of offensive
language. We develop four automatic classification systems, each designed to
work for both the English and the Danish language. In the detection of
offensive language in English, the best performing system achieves a macro
averaged F1-score of $0.74$, and the best performing system for Danish achieves
a macro averaged F1-score of $0.70$. In the detection of whether or not an
offensive post is targeted, the best performing system for English achieves a
macro averaged F1-score of $0.62$, while the best performing system for Danish
achieves a macro averaged F1-score of $0.73$. Finally, in the detection of the
target type in a targeted offensive post, the best performing system for

taking advantage of localization in the Fourier domain. For a signal $f$ on
vertices of a weighted graph $\mathcal{G}$ with Laplacian matrix $\mathcal{L}$,
standard Fourier analysis of $f$ relies on the study of functions
$g(\mathcal{L})f$ for some filters $g$ on $I_\mathcal{L}$, the smallest
interval containing the Laplacian spectrum ${\rm sp}(\mathcal{L}) \subset
I_\mathcal{L}$. We show that for carefully chosen partitions $I_\mathcal{L} =
\sqcup_{1\leq k\leq K} I_k$ ($I_k \subset I_\mathcal{L}$), there are many
advantages in understanding the collection $(g(\mathcal{L}_{I_k})f)_{1\leq
k\leq K}$ instead of $g(\mathcal{L})f$ directly, where $\mathcal{L}_I$ is the
projected matrix $P_I(\mathcal{L})\mathcal{L}$. First, the partition provides a
convenient modelling for the study of theoretical properties of Fourier
analysis and allows for new results in graph signal analysis (\emph{e.g.} noise
level estimation, Fourier support approximation). We extend the study of
spectral graph wavelets to wavelets localized in the Fourier domain, called
LocLets, and we show that well-known frames can be written in terms of LocLets.
From a practical perspective, we highlight the interest of the proposed
localized Fourier analysis through many experiments that show significant
improvements in two different tasks on large graphs, noise level estimation and
signal denoising. Moreover, efficient strategies permit to compute sequence
$(g(\mathcal{L}_{I_k})f)_{1\leq k\leq K}$ with the same time complexity as for
the computation of $g(\mathcal{L})f$.

of libraries and studying whether the difficulties stayed consistent over

research in this area. Both static and dynamic analyses are mostly absent and
badly needed to help developers find errors earlier. While there has been some
early research on debugging, much more work is needed. API misuses are
prevalent and API design improvements are sorely needed. Last and somewhat
surprisingly, a tug of war between providing higher levels of abstractions and
the need to understand the behavior of the trained model is prevalent.

for learning such representations: (1) alignment, which maps different
independently trained monolingual representations into a shared space, and (2)
joint training, which directly learns unified multilingual representations
using monolingual and cross-lingual objectives jointly. In this paper, we first
conduct direct comparisons of representations learned using both of these
methods across diverse cross-lingual tasks. Our empirical results reveal a set
of pros and cons for both methods, and show that the relative performance of
alignment versus joint training is task-dependent. Stemming from this analysis,
we propose a simple and novel framework that combines these two previously
mutually-exclusive approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
proposed framework alleviates limitations of both approaches, and outperforms
existing methods on the MUSE bilingual lexicon induction (BLI) benchmark. We
further show that this framework can generalize to contextualized
representations such as Multilingual BERT, and produces state-of-the-art

  on SrTiO3 substrates by pulsed laser deposition","Recently, Bi2O2Se is discovered as a promising two-dimensional (2D)
semiconductor for next generation electronics, due to its moderate bandgap
size, high electron mobility and pronounced ambient stability. Meanwhile, it
has been predicted that high quality Bi2O2Se-related heterostructures may
possess exotic physical phenomena, such as piezoelectricity and topological
superconductivity. Herein, we report the first successful heteroepitaxial
growth of Bi2O2Se films on SrTiO3 substrates via pulsed laser deposition (PLD)
method. Films obtained under optimal conditions show an epitaxial growth with
the c axis perpendicular to the film surface and the a and b axes parallel to
the substrate. The growth mode transition to three dimensional (3D) island from
quasi-2D layer of the heteroepitaxial Bi2O2Se films on SrTiO3 (001) substrates
is observed as prolonging deposition time of films. The maximum value of
electron mobility reaches 160 cm2/V-1s-1 at room temperature in a 70nm-thick
film. The thickness dependent mobility provides evidence that
interface-scattering is likely to be the limiting factor for the relatively low
electron mobility at low temperature, implying that the interface engineering
as an effective method to tune the low temperature electron mobility. Our work
suggests the epitaxial Bi2O2Se films grown by PLD are promising for both
fundamental study and practical applications.

disk instability. Based on the fact that gaseous objects are preferentially
observed around metal-rich host stars, most extra-solar gaseous objects
discovered to date are thought to have been formed by core accretion. Here, we
present 569 samples of gaseous planets and brown dwarfs found in 485 planetary
systems that span three mass regimes with boundary values at 4 and 25
Jupiter-mass masses through performing cluster analyses of these samples
regarding the host-star metallicity, after minimizing the impact of the
selection effect of radial-velocity measurement on the cluster analysis. The
larger mass is thought to be the upper mass limit of the objects that were
formed during the planetary formation processes. In contrast, the lower mass
limit appears to reflect the difference between planetary formation processes
around early-type and G-type stars; disk instability plays a greater role in
the planetary formation process around early-type stars than that around G-type
stars. Population with masses between 4 and 25 Jupiter masses that orbit
early-type stars comprise planets formed not only via the core-accretion
process but also via gravitational disk instability because the population
preferentially orbits metal-poor stars or is independent of the host-star
metallicity. Therefore, it is essential to have a hybrid scenario for the
planetary formation of the diverse systems.

for detecting interfaces and related anomalies in complicated high-dimensional

optimally stratify a given dataset into clusters, each of which is in turn
well-approximable by a suitable submanifold of the ambient space. Since these
approximating submanifolds might have different dimensions, we are able to
detect non-manifold like singular regions in data even when none of the data
points have been sampled from those singularities. We showcase this method by
identifying the intersection of two surfaces in the 24-dimensional space of
cyclo-octane conformations, and by locating all the self-intersections of a
Henneberg minimal surface immersed in 3-dimensional space. Due to the local
nature of the required topological computations, the algorithmic burden of
performing such data stratification is readily distributable across several

radial-velocity determinations of their planets' masses, obstructing detection
of Earth twins. Since 2015 July we have been monitoring disc-integrated
sunlight in daytime using a purpose-built solar telescope and fibre feed to the
HARPS-N stellar radial-velocity spectrometer. We present and analyse the solar
radial-velocity measurements and cross-correlation function (CCF) parameters
obtained in the first 3 years of observation, interpreting them in the context
of spatially-resolved solar observations. We describe a Bayesian mixture-model
approach to automated data-quality monitoring. We provide dynamical and daily
differential-extinction corrections to place the radial velocities in the
heliocentric reference frame, and the CCF shape parameters in the sidereal
frame. We achieve a photon-noise limited radial-velocity precision better than
0.43 m s$^{-1}$ per 5-minute observation. The day-to-day precision is limited
by zero-point calibration uncertainty with an RMS scatter of about 0.4 m
s$^{-1}$. We find significant signals from granulation and solar activity.
Within a day, granulation noise dominates, with an amplitude of about 0.4 m
s$^{-1}$ and an autocorrelation half-life of 15 minutes. On longer timescales,
activity dominates. Sunspot groups broaden the CCF as they cross the solar
disc. Facular regions temporarily reduce the intrinsic asymmetry of the CCF.
The radial-velocity increase that accompanies an active-region passage has a
typical amplitude of 5 m s$^{-1}$ and is correlated with the line asymmetry,
but leads it by 3 days. Spectral line-shape variability thus shows promise as a
proxy for recovering the true radial velocity.

a correction constant (CC-like) in the field equations sources the late cosmic
acceleration. This constant is related to a new parameter, $z_{ini}$, which is
interpreted as the redshift of CC-like emergence. By comparing with the CC
value obtained from Planck and Supernovaes measurements, it is possible to
estimate $z_{ini}=11.15^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ and $z_{ini}=11.43^{+0.03}_{-0.06}$

Supernovae measurements. We also include linear perturbations, starting with

between a ferromagnet and heavy metal are particularly important for spin-based
information storage and computation. Recent discoveries suggest they can create
chiral spin structures (e.g. skyrmions), which have often been identified

topological Hall effect (THE). In this work, however, we have present an
unusual anomalous Hall effect (UAHE) in MnxGa/Pt bilayers and demonstrated that
the features extremely similar to THE can be generated without involving any

used to explore the magnetic field-dependent behavior of spin structures, and
the UAHE as a function of magnetic field does not peak near the maximal density
of magnetic bubbles. The results unambiguously evidence that the UAHE in
MnxGa/Pt bilayers shows no correlation with chiral spin structures but is
driven by the modified interfacial properties. The bump/dip features of Hall
signals cannot be taken as an unambiguous signature for the emergence of chiral
spin structures, and a wealth of underlying and interesting physics need

  Systems","Channel estimation for the downlink of frequency division duplex (FDD)
massive MIMO systems is well known to generate a large overhead as the amount
of training generally scales with the number of transmit antennas in a MIMO
system. In this paper, we consider the solution of extrapolating the channel
frequency response from uplink pilot estimates to the downlink frequency band,
which completely removes the training overhead. We first show that conventional
estimators fail to achieve reasonable accuracy. We propose instead to use
high-resolution channel estimation. We derive theoretical lower bounds (LB) for
the mean squared error (MSE) of the extrapolated channel. Assuming that the
paths are well separated, the LB is simplified in an expression that gives
considerable physical insight. It is then shown that the MSE is inversely
proportional to the number of receive antennas while the extrapolation
performance penalty scales with the square of the ratio of the frequency offset
and the training bandwidth. The channel extrapolation performance is validated
through numeric simulations and experimental measurements taken in an anechoic
chamber. Our main conclusion is that channel extrapolation is a viable solution
for FDD massive MIMO systems if accurate system calibration is performed and

  Pouring Actions","Our brains are able to exploit coarse physical models of fluids to solve
everyday manipulation tasks. There has been considerable interest in developing
such a capability in robots so that they can autonomously manipulate fluids
adapting to different conditions. In this paper, we investigate the problem of
adaptation to liquids with different characteristics. We develop a simple
calibration task (stirring with a stick) that enables rapid inference of the
parameters of the liquid from RBG data. We perform the inference in the space
of simulation parameters rather than on physically accurate parameters. This
facilitates prediction and optimization tasks since the inferred parameters may
be fed directly to the simulator. We demonstrate that our ""stirring"" learner
performs better than when the robot is calibrated with pouring actions. We show
that our method is able to infer properties of three different liquids --
water, glycerin and gel -- and present experimental results by executing
stirring and pouring actions on a UR10. We believe that decoupling of the
training actions from the goal task is an important step towards simple,
autonomous learning of the behavior of different fluids in unstructured
environments.

training the same simple superresolution (SR) network multiple times. After
initially training an SR network by using pairs of a corrupted low resolution
(LR) image and an original image, the proposed method makes use of the trained
SR network to generate new high resolution (HR) images with a doubled
resolution from the original uncorrupted images. Then, the new HR images are
downscaled to the original resolution, which work as target images for the SR
network in the next stage. The newly generated HR images by the repeatedly
trained SR network show better image quality and this strategy of training LR
to mimic new HR can lead to a more efficient SR network. Up to a certain point,
by repeating this process multiple times, better and better images are
obtained. This recurrent leaning strategy for SR can be a good solution for
downsizing convolution networks and making a more efficient SR network. To
measure the enhanced image quality, for the first time in this area of
super-resolution and image enhancement, we use VIQET MOS score which reflects
human visual quality more accurately than the conventional MSE measure.

  Electroencephalography Forward Problem","The symmetric formulation of the electroencephalography (EEG) forward problem
is a well-known and widespread equation thanks to the high level of accuracy

to ill-conditioned problems when the discretization density or the brain
conductivity contrast increases, resulting in numerical instabilities and
increasingly slow solutions. This work addresses and solves this problem by
proposing a new regularized symmetric formulation. The new scheme is obtained
by leveraging on Calderon identities which allow to introduce a dual symmetric
equation that, combined with the standard one, results in a second kind
operator which is both stable and well-conditioned under all the above
mentioned conditions. The new formulation presented here can be easily
integrated into existing EEG imaging packages since it can be obtained with the
same computational technology required by the standard symmetric formulation.
The performance of the new scheme is substantiated by both theoretical
developments and numerical results which corroborate the theory and show the
practical impact of the new technique.

atoms to cavity optical field when external optical pumping exceeds a threshold
strength. Here we report a prediction of the superrandiant instability driven
by Anderson localization, realized with a hybrid system of Dicke and
Aubry-Andre (DAA) model for bosons trapped in a one-dimensional (1D)
quasiperiodic optical lattice and coupled to a cavity. Our central finding is
that for bosons condensed in localized phase given by the DAA model, the
resonant superradiant scattering is induced, for which the critical optical
pumping of superradiant phase transition approaches zero, giving an instability
driven by Anderson localization. The superradiant phase for the DAA model with
or without a mobility edge is investigated, showing that the localization
driven superradiant instability is in sharp contrast to the superradiance as
widely observed for Bose condensate in extended states, and should be
insensitive to temperature of the system. This study unveils an insightful
effect of localization on the Dicke superradiance, and is well accessible based
on the current experiments.

  quark-gluon plasma","In ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions, enormous magnetic fields are
generated because of fast-moving charged particles. In the presence of these
magnetic fields, the spin of particles is aligned either in the parallel or in
the antiparallel direction with respect to the direction of the magnetic field.
A finite magnetization is thus produced. It is known that a finite magnetic
susceptibility, $\chi_{m}$, changes the evolution of the energy density of the
quark-gluon plasma (QGP), which is believed to be created in these collisions.
Depending on whether the system under consideration is a paramagnetic
($\chi_{m}>0$) or diamagnetic ($\chi_{m}<0$) fluid, it slows down or speeds up
the decay of the energy density, and affects other thermodynamic quantities. In
general, one expects that the magnetic susceptibility depends on the magnetic
field and temperature. Bearing in mind that these parameters evolve with the
evolution of the fluid, a nonuniform magnetic susceptibility in this system is
thus expected. In this work, we first determine $\chi_{m}$ by using a certain
analogy to the standard anisotropic kinetic theory, where the one-particle
distribution function is replaced by the corresponding anisotropic distribution
function. We then determine the proper time dependence of the magnetic
susceptibility in the framework of the ideal transverse magnetohydrodynamics.
We also study the effect of dissipation on the evolution of $\chi_{m}$.

progenitors and explosion mechanism differ from `normal' SNe Ia. One method of
determining information about supernova progenitors we cannot directly observe
is to observe the stellar population adjacent to the apparent supernova
explosion site to infer the distribution of stellar population ages and
metallicities. We obtain integral field observations and analyse the spectra
extracted from regions of projected radius $\sim\,\mathrm{kpc}$ about the
apparent SN explosion site for 11 91bg-like SNe in both early- and late-type
galaxies. We utilize full-spectrum spectral fitting to determine the ages and
metallicities of the stellar population within the aperture. We find that the
majority of the stellar populations that hosted 91bg-like supernovae have
little recent star formation. The ages of the stellar populations suggest that
that 91bg-like SN progenitors explode after delay times of $>6\,\mathrm{Gyr}$,
much longer than the typical delay time of normal SNe Ia, which peaks at $\sim

comparing voting mechanisms. m voters and n candidates are jointly embedded in
an (unknown) metric space, and the voters submit rankings of candidates by
non-decreasing distance from themselves. Based on the submitted rankings, the
social choice rule chooses a winning candidate; the quality of the winner is
the sum of the (unknown) distances to the voters. The rule's choice will in
general be suboptimal, and the worst-case ratio between the cost of its chosen
candidate and the optimal candidate is called the rule's distortion. It was
shown in prior work that every deterministic rule has distortion at least 3,
while the Copeland rule and related rules guarantee worst-case distortion at
most 5; a very recent result gave a rule with distortion $2+\sqrt{5} \approx
4.236$.
  We provide a framework based on LP-duality and flow interpretations of the
dual which provides a simpler and more unified way for proving upper bounds on
the distortion of social choice rules. We illustrate the utility of this
approach with three examples. First, we give a fairly simple proof of a strong
generalization of the upper bound of 5 on the distortion of Copeland, to social
choice rules with short paths from the winning candidate to the optimal
candidate in generalized weak preference graphs. A special case of this result
recovers the recent $2+\sqrt{5}$ guarantee. Second, using this generalized
bound, we show that the Ranked Pairs and Schulze rules have distortion
$\Theta(\sqrt(n))$. Finally, our framework naturally suggests a combinatorial
rule that is a strong candidate for achieving distortion 3, which had also been
proposed in recent work. We prove that the distortion bound of 3 would follow
from any of three combinatorial conjectures we formulate.

inconsistencies, a poorly exposed sky, or simply suffer from an uninteresting

been recognized as the best-performing automated auction-market trading-agent
strategy currently known in the AI/Agents literature; in this paper, we
demonstrate that it is in fact routinely outperformed by another algorithm when
exhaustively tested across a sufficiently wide range of market scenarios. The
novel step taken here is to use large-scale compute facilities to brute-force
exhaustively evaluate AA in a variety of market environments based on those
used for testing it in the original publications. Our results show that even in
these simple environments AA is consistently out-performed by IBM's GDX
algorithm, first published in 2002. We summarize here results from more than
one million market simulation experiments, orders of magnitude more testing
than was reported in the original publications that first introduced AA. A 2019
ICAART paper by Cliff claimed that AA's failings were revealed by testing it in
more realistic experiments, with conditions closer to those found in real
financial markets, but here we demonstrate that even in the simple experiment
conditions that were used in the original AA papers, exhaustive testing shows
AA to be outperformed by GDX. We close this paper with a discussion of the
methodological implications of our work: any results from previous papers where
any one trading algorithm is claimed to be superior to others on the basis of
only a few thousand trials are probably best treated with some suspicion now.
The rise of cloud computing means that the compute-power necessary to subject
trading algorithms to millions of trials over a wide range of conditions is
readily available at reasonable cost: we should make use of this; exhaustive
testing such as is shown here should be the norm in future evaluations and
comparisons of new trading algorithms.

  Map Considering Real-Gas Processes and Flexible Operation","This paper contributes to modeling and supervision of multi-stage centrifugal
compressors coping with real-gas processes and steady to highly transient
operating conditions. A novel dynamic model is derived, and the incorporation
of the generic Lee-Kesler-Pl\""ocker real-gas equation of state and its
derivatives is presented. The model allows for embedding arbitrarily shaped
performance maps, based on state-of-the-art polytropic change-of-state
compressor characteristics. As the validity of these maps is a key issue for
simulation and model-based monitoring, performance maps are treated as
time-variant, and their shape is to be identified and monitored during
operation. The proposed real-time map estimation scheme comprises an Unscented
Kalman Filter and a newly proposed algorithm, referred to as Recursive Map
Estimation. The combination yields a novel parameter and state estimator, which
is expected to be superior if some parameters are characterized by a distinct
operating point dependency. Two additional time-variant parameters are provided
for monitoring: The first indicates the level of confidence in the local
estimate, and the second points to drastic performance map alterations, which
may be further exploited in fault detection. A modified reference simulation of
a two-stage supercritical carbon dioxide compressor with known state
trajectories, performance maps, and alterations demonstrates the successful
application of the entire monitoring scheme, and serves for a discussion of the
results.

particularly prevalent for languages with diacritics that tend to be omitted in
writing, such as Arabic. Omitting diacritics leads to an increase in the number
of homographs: different words with the same spelling. Diacritic restoration
could theoretically help disambiguate these words, but in practice, the
increase in overall sparsity leads to performance degradation in NLP
applications. In this paper, we propose approaches for automatically marking a
subset of words for diacritic restoration, which leads to selective homograph
disambiguation. Compared to full or no diacritic restoration, these approaches
yield selectively-diacritized datasets that balance sparsity and lexical
disambiguation. We evaluate the various selection strategies extrinsically on
several downstream applications: neural machine translation, part-of-speech
tagging, and semantic textual similarity. Our experiments on Arabic show
promising results, where our devised strategies on selective diacritization
lead to a more balanced and consistent performance in downstream applications.

flavor QCD ensembles using the isotropic-clover fermion action, with lattice
dimensions $24^3\times 64$ and $32^3\times 96$ at the lattice spacing of
$a=0.127$ fm, and with the quark mass equivalent to a pion mass of $m_\pi

smeared-smeared pion source-sink interpolation fields in obtaining the lattice
QCD matrix elements using the summation method. After one-loop perturbative
matching and combining the pseudo-distributions from these two ensembles, we
extract the pion valence quark distribution using a phenomenological functional
form motivated by the global fits of parton distribution functions. We also
calculate the lowest four moments of the pion quark distribution through the
""OPE without OPE"". We present a qualitative comparison between our lattice QCD
extraction of the pion valence quark distribution with that obtained from

prediction with expert advice, we present an online algorithm whose regret
depends optimally on the number of labels allowed and $Q^*$ (the quadratic
variation of the losses of the best action in hindsight), along with a
parameter-free counterpart whose regret depends optimally on $Q$ (the quadratic
variation of the losses of all the actions). These quantities can be
significantly smaller than $T$ (the total time horizon), yielding an
improvement over existing, variation-independent results for the problem. We
then extend our analysis to handle label efficient prediction with bandit
feedback, i.e., label efficient bandits. Our work builds upon the framework of
optimistic online mirror descent, and leverages second order corrections along
with a carefully designed hybrid regularizer that encodes the constrained
information structure of the problem. We then consider revealing action-partial
monitoring games -- a version of label efficient prediction with additive
information costs, which in general are known to lie in the \textit{hard} class
of games having minimax regret of order $T^{\frac{2}{3}}$. We provide a
strategy with an $\mathcal{O}((Q^*T)^{\frac{1}{3}})$ bound for revealing action
games, along with one with a $\mathcal{O}((QT)^{\frac{1}{3}})$ bound for the
full class of hard partial monitoring games, both being strict improvements
over current bounds.

broad distributions, with approximative average values of 500 K for HCO and 200
K for CH$_3$. If they are located on the surface close to each other (3 to 4
\AA), molecular dynamics calculations based on density functional theory show
that they can form acetaldehyde (CH$_3$CHO) or CH$_4$ + CO in barrier-less
reactions, depending on the initial orientation of the molecules with respect
to each other. In some orientations, no spontaneous reactions were found, the
products remained bound to the surface. Sufficient configurational sampling,
inclusion of the vibrational zero point energy, and a thorough benchmark of the
applied electronic structure method are important to predict reliable binding
energies for such weakly interacting systems. From these results it is clear
that complex organic molecules, like acetaldehyde, can be formed by
recombination reactions of radicals on CO surfaces.

factors may jointly exist and fit the real data (confidence contours), however,
its estimation process raises several issues as the number of factors
increases. Hence, in this paper, we focus on the estimation of a subregion
within the confidence contour that we called as Confidence Subcontour Box
(CSB). We proposed two main algorithms for CSB estimation, as well as its
interpretation and validation. Given the way we estimated CSB, we expected and
validated some useful properties of this new kind of confidence interval: a
user-defined uncertainty level, asymmetrical intervals, sensitivity assessment

  Network to map complex urban forms at finer scale: Evidence from Mumbai","The satellite imagery classification task is fundamental to spatial knowledge
discovery. Several image classification methods are used to create standardized
Land use and Land cover (LULC) maps, which facilitate research on spatial and
ecological processes and human activities. Local Climate Zones (LCZ)
classification maps are an example of standardized maps which have been widely
used to demarcate the homogeneity in built and natural character in the cities.
The LCZ classification scheme is primarily focused on urban climate-related
research, in which 17 climate zones are mapped in a city area with the 100-150m
spatial resolution. Each zone exhibits physical properties related to urban
form and functions essential for thermal behavior studies. Extending this
widely adopted approach to create LULC maps at finer resolution using the LCZ
mapping scheme would benefit the allied domains of urban planning,
transportation, and water resources management. This study proposes a novel
solution to generate classification maps with a 10-band Sentinel-2B dataset and
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) at the 10m spatial resolution. The
classification benefits from CNNs property to preserve local structures in the
image datasets. The proposed CNN model outperforms traditional machine learning
models such as Artificial Neural Network, Random Forests, and Support Vector
Machines. The overall accuracy and kappa statistic of the CNN model trained on
14 urban and natural classes are 82 percent and 0.81, respectively. The study

network with two coupled subpopulations. To quantify interactions within and
between these subpopulations, we estimated the corresponding (delayed) mutual
information that -- in general -- quantifies the capacity or the maximum rate
at which information can be transferred to recover a sender's information at
the receiver with a vanishingly low error probability. After verifying their
equivalence with estimates based on the continuous phase data, we determined
the mutual information using the time points at which the individual phases
passed through their respective Poincar\'{e} sections. This stroboscopic view
on the dynamics may resemble, e.g., neural spike times, that are common
observables in the study of neuronal information transfer. This discretization
also increased processing speed significantly, rendering it particularly
suitable for a fine-grained analysis of the effects of experimental and model
parameters. In our model, the delayed mutual information within each
subpopulation peaked at zero delay, whereas between the subpopulations it was
always maximal at non-zero delay, irrespective of parameter choices. We
observed that the delayed mutual information of the desynchronized
subpopulation preceded the synchronized subpopulation. Put differently, the
oscillators of the desynchronized subpopulation were 'driving' the ones in the
synchronized subpopulation. These findings were also observed when estimating
mutual information of the full phase trajectories. We can thus conclude that
the delayed mutual information of discrete time points allows for inferring a
functional directed flow of information between subpopulations of coupled phase
oscillators.

polarization offer a unique way to determine the underlying emission
mechanism(s) in these objects as well as probing the particle acceleration
mechanism(s) that lead to the observed $\gamma$-ray emission. Herein we examine
the jointly-observed data from POLAR and GBM of GRB 170114A to determine its
spectral and polarization properties and seek to understand the emission
processes that generate these observations. We aim to develop an extensible and
statistically sound framework for these types of measurements applicable to
other instruments. We leverage the existing 3ML analysis framework to develop a
new analysis pipeline for simultaneously modeling the spectral and polarization
data. We derive the proper Poisson likelihood for $\gamma$-ray polarization
measurements in the presence of background. The developed framework is publicly
available for similar measurements with other $\gamma$-ray polarimeters. The
data are analyzed within a Bayesian probabilistic context and the spectral data
from both instruments are simultaneously modeled with a physical, numerical
synchrotron code. The spectral modeling of the data is consistent with a
synchrotron photon model as has been found in a majority of similarly analyzed
single-pulse GRBs. The polarization results reveal a slight trend of growing
polarization in time reaching values of ~30% at the temporal peak of the
emission. Additionally, it is observed that the polarization angle evolves with
time throughout the emission. These results hint at a synchrotron origin of the
emission but further observations of many GRBs are required to verify these
evolutionary trends. Furthermore, we encourage the development of time-resolved
polarization models for the prompt emission of GRBs as the current models are
not predictive enough to enable a full modeling of our current data.

component. All this observational evidence suggests that the gas has been
removed during a ram-pressure stripping event. This observation is thus the
first evidence that dynamical interactions with the intracluster medium were
active when the Universe had only half of its present age. The density of the

performance of conditional text generation systems. However, such scores are
non-differentiable and cannot be used in the standard supervised learning

  However, we argue that current n-gram overlap based measures that are used as

either output a score of sentence-level syntactic and semantic similarity

  through Exposed Material Forming Gas Annealing","Metal-mediated exfoliation has been demonstrated as a promising approach for
obtaining large-area flakes of 2D materials to fabricate prototypical
nanoelectronics. However, several processing challenges related to organic
contamination at the interfaces of the 2D material and the gate oxide must be
overcome to realize robust devices with high yield. Here, we demonstrate an
optimized process to realize high-performance field-effect transistor (FET)
arrays from large-area (~5000 um2) monolayer MoS2 with a yield of 85 %. A
central element of this process is an exposed material forming gas anneal
(EM-FGA) that results in uniform FET performance metrics (i.e., field-effect
mobilities, threshold voltages, and contact performance). Complementary
analytical measurements show that the EM-FGA process reduces deleterious
channel doping effects by decreasing organic contamination, while also reducing
the prevalence of insulating molybdenum oxide, effectively improving the
MoS2-gate oxide interface. The uniform FET performance metrics and high device
yield achieved by applying the EM-FGA technique on large-area 2D material
flakes will help advance the fabrication of complex 2D nanoelectronics devices
and demonstrates the need for improved engineering of the 2D material-gate
oxide interface.

  limitations","Consider the following heuristic for building a decision tree for a function
$f : \{0,1\}^n \to \{\pm 1\}$. Place the most influential variable $x_i$ of $f$
at the root, and recurse on the subfunctions $f_{x_i=0}$ and $f_{x_i=1}$ on the
left and right subtrees respectively; terminate once the tree is an
$\varepsilon$-approximation of $f$. We analyze the quality of this heuristic,
obtaining near-matching upper and lower bounds:
  $\circ$ Upper bound: For every $f$ with decision tree size $s$ and every
$\varepsilon \in (0,\frac1{2})$, this heuristic builds a decision tree of size
at most $s^{O(\log(s/\varepsilon)\log(1/\varepsilon))}$.
  $\circ$ Lower bound: For every $\varepsilon \in (0,\frac1{2})$ and $s \le
2^{\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n})}$, there is an $f$ with decision tree size $s$ such that
this heuristic builds a decision tree of size $s^{\tilde{\Omega}(\log s)}$.
  We also obtain upper and lower bounds for monotone functions:
$s^{O(\sqrt{\log s}/\varepsilon)}$ and $s^{\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt[4]{\log s } )}$
respectively. The lower bound disproves conjectures of Fiat and Pechyony (2004)
and Lee (2009).
  Our upper bounds yield new algorithms for properly learning decision trees
under the uniform distribution. We show that these algorithms---which are
motivated by widely employed and empirically successful top-down decision tree
learning heuristics such as ID3, C4.5, and CART---achieve provable guarantees
that compare favorably with those of the current fastest algorithm (Ehrenfeucht
and Haussler, 1989). Our lower bounds shed new light on the limitations of
these heuristics.
  Finally, we revisit the classic work of Ehrenfeucht and Haussler. We extend
it to give the first uniform-distribution proper learning algorithm that
achieves polynomial sample and memory complexity, while matching its
state-of-the-art quasipolynomial runtime.

incomparable if $u$ doesn't reach $v$ and vice versa. We denote by \emph{width}

In this paper we present an algorithm that computes a dominance drawing of a

by the algorithm is $O(kn)$, with a precomputation time of $O(km)$, needed to
compute a \emph{compressed transitive closure} of $G$, and extra $O(n^2w_G)$ or
$O(n^3)$ time, if we want $k=w_G$. Our algorithm gives a tighter bound to the
dominance dimension of a DAG. As corollaries, a new family of graphs having a
2-dimensional dominance drawing and a new upper bound to the dimension of a
partial order are obtained. We also introduce the concept of transitive module

results given previously using these concepts.

  Formation Histories Traced by EW(H$α$) and EW(H$δ_A$)","To investigate the variability of the star formation rate (SFR) of galaxies,
we define a star formation change parameter, SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm
800Myr}$ which is the ratio of the SFR averaged within the last 5 Myr to the
SFR averaged within the last 800 Myr. We show that this parameter can be
determined from a combination of H$\alpha$ emission and H$\delta$ absorption,
plus the 4000 A break, with an uncertainty of $\sim$0.07 dex for star-forming
galaxies. We then apply this estimator to MaNGA galaxies, both globally within
Re and within radial annuli. We find that galaxies with higher global SFR$_{\rm
5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 800Myr}$ appear to have higher SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm
800Myr}$ at all galactic radii, i.e. that galaxies with a recent temporal
enhancement in overall SFR have enhanced star formation at all galactic radii.
The dispersion of the SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 800Myr}$ at a given relative
galactic radius and a given stellar mass decreases with the (indirectly
inferred) gas depletion time: locations with short gas depletion time appear to
undergo bigger variations in their star-formation rates on Gyr or less
timescales. In Wang et al. (2019) we showed that the dispersion in
star-formation rate surface densities $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ in the galaxy
population appears to be inversely correlated with the inferred gas depletion
timescale and interpreted this in terms of the dynamical response of a
gas-regulator system to changes in the gas inflow rate. In this paper, we can
now prove directly with SFR$_{\rm 5Myr}$/SFR$_{\rm 800Myr}$ that these effects
are indeed due to genuine temporal variations in the SFR of individual galaxies
on timescales between $10^7$ and $10^9$ years rather than possibly reflecting
intrinsic, non-temporal, differences between different galaxies.

  formation of Mn lines in late-type stars","Manganese (Mn) is a key Fe-group elements, commonly employed in stellar
population and nucleosynthesis studies to explore the role of SN Ia. We have
developed a new non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) model of Mn,
including new photo-ionisation cross-sections and new transition rates caused
by collisions with H and H- atoms. We applied the model in combination with
1-dimensional (1D) LTE model atmospheres and 3D hydrodynamical simulations of
stellar convection to quantify the impact of NLTE and convection on the line
formation. We show that the effects of NLTE are present in Mn I and, to a
lesser degree, in Mn II lines, and these increase with metallicity and with
effective temperature of a model. Employing 3D NLTE radiative transfer, we
derive new abundance of Mn in the Sun, A(Mn)=5.52 +/- 0.03 dex, consistent with
the element abundance in C I meteorites. We also apply our methods to the
analysis of three metal-poor benchmark stars. We find that 3D NLTE abundances
are significantly higher than 1D LTE. For dwarfs, the differences between 1D
NLTE and 3D NLTE abundances are typically within 0.15 dex, however, the effects
are much larger in the atmospheres of giants owing to their more vigorous
convection. We show that 3D NLTE successfully solves the ionisation and
excitation balance for the RGB star HD 122563 that cannot be achieved by 1D LTE
or 1D NLTE modelling. For HD 84937 and HD 140283, the ionisation balance is
satisfied, however, the resonance Mn I triplet lines still show somewhat lower
abundances compared to the high-excitation lines. Our results for the benchmark
stars confirm that 1D LTE modelling leads to significant systematic biases in
Mn abundances across the full wavelength range from the blue to the IR. We also
produce a list of Mn lines that are not significantly biased by 3D and can be
reliably, within the 0.1 dex uncertainty, modelled in 1D NLTE.

generation. However, a key challenge when using GANs is how to best measure
their ability to generate realistic data. In this paper, we demonstrate that an
intrinsic dimensional characterization of the data space learned by a GAN model
leads to an effective evaluation metric for GAN quality. In particular, we
propose a new evaluation measure, CrossLID, that assesses the local intrinsic
dimensionality (LID) of real-world data with respect to neighborhoods found in
GAN-generated samples. Intuitively, CrossLID measures the degree to which
manifolds of two data distributions coincide with each other. In experiments on
4 benchmark image datasets, we compare our proposed measure to several
state-of-the-art evaluation metrics. Our experiments show that CrossLID is
strongly correlated with the progress of GAN training, is sensitive to mode
collapse, is robust to small-scale noise and image transformations, and robust
to sample size. Furthermore, we show how CrossLID can be used within the GAN
training process to improve generation quality.

with a value from $\Sigma$, the \emph{static dictionary} problem asks to
preprocess these (key, value) pairs into a data structure, supporting
value-retrieval queries: for any given $x\in [U]$, $\mathtt{valRet}(x)$ must
return the value associated with $x$ if $x\in S$, or return $\bot$ if $x\notin
S$. The special case where $|\Sigma|=1$ is called the \emph{membership}
problem. The ""textbook"" solution is to use a hash table, which occupies linear
space and answers each query in constant time. On the other hand, the minimum
possible space to encode all (key, value) pairs is only $\mathtt{OPT}:=
\lceil\lg_2\binom{U}{n}+n\lg_2|\Sigma|\rceil$ bits, which could be much less.
  In this paper, we design a randomized dictionary data structure using
$\mathtt{OPT}+\mathrm{poly}\lg n+O(\lg\lg\lg\lg\lg U)$ bits of space, and it
has \emph{expected constant} query time, assuming the query algorithm can
access an external lookup table of size $n^{0.001}$. The lookup table depends
only on $U$, $n$ and $|\Sigma|$, and not the input. Previously, even for
membership queries and $U\leq n^{O(1)}$, the best known data structure with
constant query time requires $\mathtt{OPT}+n/\mathrm{poly}\lg n$ bits of space
(Pagh [Pag01] and P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu [Pat08]); the best-known using
$\mathtt{OPT}+n^{0.999}$ space has query time $O(\lg n)$; the only known
non-trivial data structure with $\mathtt{OPT}+n^{0.001}$ space has $O(\lg n)$
query time and requires a lookup table of size $\geq n^{2.99}$ (!). Our new
data structure answers open questions by P\v{a}tra\c{s}cu and Thorup
[Pat08,Tho13].
  We also present a scheme that compresses a sequence $X\in\Sigma^n$ to its
zeroth order (empirical) entropy up to $|\Sigma|\cdot\mathrm{poly}\lg n$ extra
bits, supporting decoding each $X_i$ in $O(\lg |\Sigma|)$ expected time.

Optics mode of the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) instrument at the
Very Large Telescope (VLT) from 0.48 - 0.93 micron, are analysed here to
determine the latitudinal and vertical distribution of cloud opacity and
methane abundance in Neptune's observable troposphere (0.1 - ~3 bar). Previous
observations at these wavelengths in 2003 by HST/STIS (Karkoschka and Tomasko
2011, Icarus 205, 674-694) found that the mole fraction of methane above the
cloud tops (at ~2 bar) varied from ~4% at equatorial latitudes to ~2% at
southern polar latitudes, by comparing the observed reflectivity at wavelengths
near 825 nm controlled primarily by either methane absorption or H2-H2/H2-He
collision-induced absorption. We find a similar variation in cloud-top methane
abundance in 2018, which suggests that this depletion of methane towards
Neptune's pole is potentially a long-lived feature, indicative of long-term
upwelling at mid-equatorial latitudes and subsidence near the poles. By
analysing these MUSE observations along the central meridian with a retrieval
model, we demonstrate that a broad boundary between the nominal and depleted
methane abundances occurs at between 20 - 40S. We also find a small depletion
of methane near the equator, perhaps indicating subsidence there, and a local
enhancement near 60 - 70S, which we suggest may be associated with South Polar
Features (SPFs) seen in Neptune's atmosphere at these latitudes. Finally, by
the use of both a reflectivity analysis and a principal component analysis, we
demonstrate that this depletion of methane towards the pole is apparent at all
locations on Neptune's disc, and not just along its central meridian.

under mode transformations, where orthogonal modes define the parties between
which quantum correlations can occur. Since the representation of a fixed
photonic quantum state in different optical mode bases can substantially
influence the entanglement properties of said state, we devise a constructive
method to obtain families of states with the genuine feature of remaining
entangled for any choice of mode decomposition. In the first step, we focus on
two-photon states in a bipartite system and optimize their entanglement
properties with respect to unitary mode transformations. Applying a necessary
and sufficient entanglement witness criteria, we are then able to prove that
the class of constructed states is entangled for arbitrary mode decompositions.
Furthermore, we provide optimal bounds to the robustness of the
mode-independent entanglement under general imperfections. In the second step,
we demonstrate the power of our technique by showing how it can be
straightforwardly extended to higher-order photon numbers in multipartite
systems, together with providing a generally applicable and rigorous definition
of mode-independent separability and inseparability for mixed states.

  diagrams","Explicitly computed Penrose diagrams are plotted for a classical model of
black hole formation and evaporation, in which black holes form by the
accretion of infalling spherical shells of matter and subsequently evaporate by
emitting spherical shells of Hawking radiation. This model is based on known
semiclassical effects, but is not a full solution of semiclassical gravity. The
method allows arbitrary interior metrics of the form
$ds^2=-f(r)\,dt^2+f(r)^{-1}\,dr^2+r^2\,d\Omega^2$, including singular and
nonsingular models. Matter dynamics are visualized by explicitly plotting
proper density in the diagrams, as well as by tracking the location of trapped
surfaces and energy condition violations. The most illustrative model
accurately approximates the standard time evolution for black hole thermal
evaporation; its time dependence and causal structure are analyzed by
inspection of the diagram. The resulting insights contradict some common
intuitions and assumptions, and we point out some examples in the literature
with assumptions that do not hold up in this more detailed model. Based on the
new diagrams, we argue for an improved understanding of the Hawking radiation
process, propose an alternate definition of ""black hole"" in the presence of

the perfectly-transmitting state (the reservoir state that flows through the

However, here we show that it can also create additional pairs of
perfectly-transmitting states at other energies, when the coupling exceeds
critical values. Then the single-level's transmission function resembles that
of a multi-level system. Even when the discrete level is outside the
reservoirs' bands, additional perfectly-transmitting states can appear inside

  Facial Landmark Detection","Recently, deep learning based facial landmark detection has achieved great
success. Despite this, we notice that the semantic ambiguity greatly degrades
the detection performance. Specifically, the semantic ambiguity means that some
landmarks (e.g. those evenly distributed along the face contour) do not have
clear and accurate definition, causing inconsistent annotations by annotators.
Accordingly, these inconsistent annotations, which are usually provided by
public databases, commonly work as the ground-truth to supervise network
training, leading to the degraded accuracy. To our knowledge, little research
has investigated this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel probabilistic
model which introduces a latent variable, i.e. the 'real' ground-truth which is
semantically consistent, to optimize. This framework couples two parts (1)
training landmark detection CNN and (2) searching the 'real' ground-truth.
These two parts are alternatively optimized: the searched 'real' ground-truth
supervises the CNN training; and the trained CNN assists the searching of
'real' ground-truth. In addition, to recover the unconfidently predicted
landmarks due to occlusion and low quality, we propose a global heatmap
correction unit (GHCU) to correct outliers by considering the global face shape
as a constraint. Extensive experiments on both image-based (300W and AFLW) and
video-based (300-VW) databases demonstrate that our method effectively improves

Taking sequential characteristics of text into consideration, a Context

arbitrarily-shaped text can be extracted with the proposed geometric properties
much more effectively. Experiments on several benchmarks, including ICDAR2015,
ICDAR2017-MLT, SCUT-CTW1500, and Total-Text, demonstrate that SAST achieves
better or comparable performance in terms of accuracy. Furthermore, the

establish an empirical baseline for interpreting the rest-UV spectra of
reionization-era galaxies. However, existing high-ionization emission line
measurements at $z>6$ ($\mathrm{W_{C IV, 0}} \gtrsim 20$ {\AA}) are uniformly
stronger than observed locally ($\mathrm{W_{C IV, 0}} \lesssim 2$ {\AA}),
likely due to the relatively high metallicities ($Z/Z_\odot > 0.1$) typically
probed by UV surveys of nearby galaxies. We present new HST/COS spectra of six
nearby ($z<0.01$) extremely metal-poor galaxies (XMPs, $Z/Z_\odot \lesssim
0.1$) targeted to address this limitation and provide constraints on the
highly-uncertain ionizing spectra powered by low-metallicity massive stars. Our
data reveal a range of spectral features, including one of the most prominent
nebular C IV doublets yet observed in local star-forming systems and strong He
II emission. Using all published UV observations of local XMPs to-date, we find
that nebular C IV emission is ubiquitous in very high specific star formation
rate systems at low metallicity, but still find equivalent widths smaller than
those measured in individual lensed systems at $z>6$. Our moderate-resolution
HST/COS data allow us to conduct an analysis of the stellar winds in a local
nebular C IV emitter, which suggests that some of the tension with $z>6$ data
may be due to existing local samples not yet probing sufficiently high
$\mathrm{\alpha/Fe}$ abundance ratios. Our results indicate that C IV emission
can play a crucial role in the JWST and ELT era by acting as an accessible

strong-interaction matter is to a large extent still built on the analysis of
low-energy models, such as those of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio-type. In this work,
we analyze the emergence of the latter class of models at intermediate and low
energy scales from fundamental quark-gluon interactions. To this end, we study
the renormalization group flow of a Fierz-complete set of four-quark
interactions and monitor their strength at finite temperature and quark
chemical potential. At small quark chemical potential, we find that the
scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel is dynamically rendered most dominant
by the gauge degrees of freedom, indicating the formation of a chiral
condensate. Moreover, the inclusion of quark-gluon interactions leaves a
significant imprint on the dynamics as measured by the curvature of the
finite-temperature phase boundary which we find to be in accordance with
lattice QCD results. At large quark chemical potential, we then observe that
the dominance pattern of the four-quark couplings is changed by the underlying
quark-gluon dynamics, without any fine-tuning of the four-quark couplings. In
this regime, the scalar-pseudoscalar interaction channel becomes subleading and
the dominance pattern suggests the formation of a chirally symmetric diquark
condensate. In particular, our study confirms the importance of explicit
$U_{\mathrm{A}}(1)$ breaking for the formation of this type of condensate at
high densities.

the first true real-time simulation of this model, with 10 s of biological
simulation time executed in 10 s wall-clock time. This surpasses best published
efforts on HPC neural simulators (3x slowdown) and GPUs running optimised SNN

that are ruled by both the amino acid sequence and thermodynamics, requires
thermodynamic quantities given by calorimetry using thermometric techniques.
The increased need for protein function in different applications requires
improvements of measurement systems assessing protein thermodynamics to handle
many kinds of samples quickly. We have developed a passive millimeter-wave
microscope that allows near-field imaging of thermal radiation, even in the low
temperature range under room temperature where passive infrared imaging systems
are ineffective. This advantage of our microscope system in combination with

themselves in aqueous solution at a temperature range low enough to freeze
water and to trap conformation intermediates in the proteins. Experiments
performed at a millimeter-wave frequency of 50 GHz in a temperature range from
130 K to 270 K for a 20 % bovine serum albumin (BSA) aqueous solution showed a
displacement between two conformational states of BSA at a temperature of
approximately 190 K as a boundary. Our microscope system using this

  Validation Studies to Intervention Trials","Many lifestyle intervention trials depend on collecting self-reported
outcomes, like dietary intake, to assess the intervention's effectiveness.
Self-reported outcome measures are subject to measurement error, which could
impact treatment effect estimation. External validation studies measure both
self-reported outcomes and an accompanying biomarker, and can therefore be used
for measurement error correction. Most validation data, though, are only
relevant for outcomes under control conditions. Statistical methods have been
developed to use external validation data to correct for outcome measurement
error under control, and then conduct sensitivity analyses around the error
under treatment to obtain estimates of the corrected average treatment effect.
However, an assumption underlying this approach is that the measurement error
structure of the outcome is the same in both the validation sample and the
intervention trial, so that the error correction is transportable to the trial.
This may not always be a valid assumption to make. In this paper, we propose an
approach that adjusts the validation sample to better resemble the trial sample
and thus leads to more transportable measurement error corrections. We also
formally investigate when bias due to poor transportability may arise. Lastly,
we examine the method performance using simulation, and illustrate them using
PREMIER, a multi-arm lifestyle intervention trial measuring self-reported
sodium intake as an outcome, and OPEN, a validation study that measures both

  1 -- CGL description and collisionless fluid hierarchy","We present a detailed guide to advanced collisionless fluid models that
incorporate kinetic effects into the fluid framework, and that are much closer
to the collisionless kinetic description than traditional magnetohydrodynamics.
Such fluid models are directly applicable to modeling turbulent evolution of a
vast array of astrophysical plasmas, such as the solar corona and the solar
wind, the interstellar medium, as well as accretion disks and galaxy clusters.
The text can be viewed as a detailed guide to Landau fluid models and it is
divided into two parts. Part 1 is dedicated to fluid models that are obtained
by closing the fluid hierarchy with simple (non Landau fluid) closures. Part 2
is dedicated to Landau fluid closures. Here in Part 1, we discuss the CGL fluid
model in great detail, together with fluid models that contain dispersive
effects introduced by the Hall term and by the finite Larmor radius (FLR)
corrections to the pressure tensor. We consider dispersive effects introduced
by the non-gyrotropic heat flux vectors. We investigate the parallel and
oblique firehose instability, and show that the non-gyrotropic heat flux
strongly influences the maximum growth rate of these instabilities.
Furthermore, we discuss fluid models that contain evolution equations for the
gyrotropic heat flux fluctuations and that are closed at the 4th-moment level
by prescribing a specific form for the distribution function. For the
bi-Maxwellian distribution, such a closure is known as the ""normal"" closure. We
also discuss a fluid closure for the bi-kappa distribution. Finally, by
considering one-dimensional Maxwellian fluid closures at higher-order moments,
we show that such fluid models are always unstable. The last possible non
Landau fluid closure is therefore the ""normal"" closure, and beyond the
4th-order moment, Landau fluid closures are required.

the sender's measurement on the shared entangled state between the sender and

involving weak measurements which can sustain entanglement upto a certain level
so that the reusability of the shared resource state is possible. The
measurements are chosen in such a way that it is weak enough to retain
entanglement and hence can be reused for quantum tasks, yet adequately strong
to ensure quantum advantage in the protocol. In this scenario, we report that
at most six sender-receiver duos can reuse the state, when the initial shared
state is entangled in a finite neighborhood of the maximally entangled state
and for a suitable choice of weak measurements. However, we observe that the
reusability number decreases with the decrease in the entanglement of the
initial shared state. Among the weakening strategies studied, Bell measurement
admixed with white noise performs better than any other low-rank weak
measurements in this situation.

sprung into existence. Among these, proof-of-work is the most common mechanism
for achieving consensus, whilst a number of coins have adopted
""ASIC-resistance"" as a desirable property, claiming to be more ""egalitarian,""S
where egalitarianism refers to the power of each coin to participate in the
creation of new coins. While proof-of-work consensus dominates the space,
several new cryptocurrencies employ alternative consensus, such as
proof-of-stake in which block minting opportunities are based on monetary
ownership. A core criticism of proof-of-stake revolves around it being less
egalitarian by making the rich richer, as opposed to proof-of-work in which
everyone can contribute equally according to their computational power. In this
paper, we give the first quantitative definition of a cryptocurrency's
\emph{egalitarianism}. Based on our definition, we measure the egalitarianism
of popular cryptocurrencies that (may or may not) employ ASIC-resistance, among
them Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, and Monero. Our simulations show, as
expected, that ASIC-resistance increases a cryptocurrency's egalitarianism. We
also measure the egalitarianism of a stake-based protocol, Ouroboros, and a
hybrid proof-of-stake/proof-of-work cryptocurrency, Decred. We show that
stake-based cryptocurrencies, under correctly selected parameters, can be
perfectly egalitarian, perhaps contradicting folklore belief.

secure offloading of both storage and computation, and recent innovations in
schemes and implementations have made it all the more attractive. At the same
time, FHE is notoriously hard to use with a very constrained programming model,
a very unusual performance profile, and many cryptographic constraints.
Existing compilers for FHE either target simpler but less efficient FHE schemes
or only support specific domains where they can rely on expert-provided
high-level runtimes to hide complications.
  This paper presents a new FHE language called Encrypted Vector Arithmetic
(EVA), which includes an optimizing compiler that generates correct and secure
FHE programs, while hiding all the complexities of the target FHE scheme.
Bolstered by our optimizing compiler, programmers can develop efficient
general-purpose FHE applications directly in EVA. For example, we have
developed image processing applications using EVA, with a very few lines of
code.
  EVA is designed to also work as an intermediate representation that can be a
target for compiling higher-level domain-specific languages. To demonstrate

attention in the field of affective computing and facial expression modeling.
However, most existing facial expression synthesis works are limited in paired
training data, low resolution, identity information damaging, and so on. To
address those limitations, this paper introduces a novel Action Unit (AU) level
facial expression synthesis method called Local Attentive Conditional
Generative Adversarial Network (LAC-GAN) based on face action units
annotations. Given desired AU labels, LAC-GAN utilizes local AU regional rules
to control the status of each AU and attentive mechanism to combine several of
them into the whole photo-realistic facial expressions or arbitrary facial
expressions. In addition, unpaired training data is utilized in our proposed
method to train the manipulation module with the corresponding AU labels, which
learns a mapping between a facial expression manifold. Extensive qualitative
and quantitative evaluations are conducted on the commonly used BP4D dataset to
verify the effectiveness of our proposed AU synthesis method.

  spectroscopic surveys -- an exploratory study","We have investigated the possibilities to quantify how much stars move in the
Milky Way stellar disk due to diffuse processes (i.e. so called blurring) and
due to influences from spiral arms and the bar (i.e. so called churning). To
this end we assume that it is possible to infer the formation radius of a star
if we know their elemental abundances and age as well as the metallicity
profile of the interstellar medium at the time of the formation of the star.
Using this information, coupled with orbital information derived from Gaia DR2
data and radial velocities from large spectroscopic surveys, we show that it is
possible to isolate stellar samples such that we can start to quantify how
important the role of churning is. We use data from APOGEE DR14, parallaxes
from Gaia and stellar ages based on C and N elemental abundances in the stars.
In our sample, we find that about half of the stars have experienced some sort
of radial migration (based solely on their orbital properties), 10 % have
likely have suffered only from churning, whilst a modest 5-7 % of stars have
never experienced either churning or blurring making them ideal tracers of the
original properties of the cool stellar disk. Our investigation shows that it
is possible to put up a framework where we can begin to quantify churning and
blurring an important. Important aspects for future work would include to
investigate how selection effects should be accounted for.

spectrum is often associated with nuclear activity, and the selection
effectiveness has been also confirmed by ultraviolet (UV) emission line ratio

unobscured (type 1) AGN was collected. Taking advantage of the large amount of
multi-band data available in the COSMOS field, we investigate the properties of
the CIV-selected type 2 AGN, focusing on their host galaxies, X-ray emission
and UV emission lines. Finally, we investigate the physical properties of the
ionized gas in the Narrow Line Region (NLR) of this type 2 AGN sample,
combining the analysis of strong UV emission lines with predictions from
photo-ionization models. We find that, in order to successfully reproduce the
relative intensity of UV emission lines of the selected high-z type 2 AGN, two
new ingredients in the photo-ionization models are fundamental,i.e. small inner
radii of the NLR (~90pc for LAGN = 10^45erg/s) and the internal dissipative
micro-turbulence of the gas emitting clouds (with vmicr~100km/s). With these
modified models, we compute the gas-phase metallicity of the NLR, and our
measurements indicate a statistically significant evolution of the metal
content with redshift. Finally, we do not observe, in our CIV-selected type 2
AGN sample, a strong relationship between the NLR gas metallicity and the
stellar mass of the host galaxy.

  Magnetosphere to the Surface","Mercury's magnetosphere is known to be affected by enhanced ram pressures and
magnetic fields inside interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Here we
report detailed observations of an ICME compressing Mercury's dayside
magnetosphere to the surface. A fast CME launched from the Sun on November 29
2013 impacted first MESSENGER, which was orbiting Mercury, on November 30 and
later STEREO-A near 1 AU on December 1. Following the ICME impact, MESSENGER
remained in the solar wind as the spacecraft traveled inwards and northwards
towards Mercury's surface until it reached and passed its closest approach to
the planet (at 371 km altitude) without crossing into the magnetosphere. The
magnetospheric crossing finally occurred 1 minute before reaching the planet's
nightside at 400 km altitude and 84$^\circ$N latitude, indicating the lack of
dayside magnetosphere on this orbit. In addition, the peak magnetic field
measured by MESSENGER at this time was 40% above the values measured in the
orbits just prior to and after the ICME, a consequence of the magnetospheric
compression. Using both a proxy method at Mercury and measurements at STEREO-A,
we show that the extremely high ram pressure associated with this ICME was more
than high enough to collapse Mercury's weak magnetosphere. As a consequence,
the ICME plasma likely interacted with Mercury's surface, evidenced by enhanced
sodium ions in the exosphere. The collapse of Mercury's dayside magnetosphere
has important implications for the habitability of close-in exoplanets around M
dwarf stars, as such events may significantly contribute to planetary
atmospheric loss in these systems.

  Information","A core component of all Structure from Motion (SfM) approaches is bundle
adjustment. As the latter is a computational bottleneck for larger blocks,
parallel bundle adjustment has become an active area of research. Particularly,
consensus-based optimization methods have been shown to be suitable for this
task. We have extended them using covariance information derived by the
adjustment of individual three-dimensional (3D) points, i.e., ""triangulation""
or ""intersection"". This does not only lead to a much better convergence
behavior, but also avoids fiddling with the penalty parameter of standard
consensus-based approaches. The corresponding novel approach can also be seen
as a variant of resection / intersection schemes, where we adjust during
intersection a number of sub-blocks directly related to the number of threads
available on a computer each containing a fraction of the cameras of the block.
We show that our novel approach is suitable for robust parallel bundle
adjustment and demonstrate its capabilities in comparison to the basic

develop their full potential if end-users neglect system usage. Accordingly,
organizations attempt to overcome barriers to end-user acceptance in the ES
context, which can be attributed to several factors on ES, organizational, and
end-user level. Trying to take advantage of the growing passion for games,
Gamification is a phenomenon proposed to motivate people by applying elements
common to games in other contexts that have the potential to increase end-user
acceptance. While first applications of Gamification exist in areas such as
finance, health, and education, utility of gamifying ES has not been explored
in-depth. Aiming to understand how Gamification can be applied to ES to
increase user motivation, we analyze literature concerning game elements (i.e.,
mechanics and dynamics) used in Gamification and related risks. Our study
yields a synthesis of mechanics in clusters of system design, challenges,
rewards, and user specifics as well as related dynamics. We discuss the extent
to which the game elements can be used to address ES acceptance barriers. While
our study reveals that Gamification has potential for motivating ES users,
future research should analyze concrete implementations of Gamification in ES
contexts to investigate long-term effects.

unpolarized games. Specifically, our vision is that there must be
mathematically precise concepts of linear refinement and intuitionistic
restriction of logic such that the linear refinement of classical logic (CL)
coincides with (classical) linear logic (LL), and its intuitionistic
restriction with the linear refinement of intuitionistic logic (IL) into
intuitionistic LL (ILL). However, LL is, in contradiction to the name, cannot
be the linear refinement of CL at least from the game-semantic point of view
due to its concurrency and polarization. In fact, existing game semantics of LL
employs concurrency, which is rather exotic to game semantics of ILL, IL or CL.
Also, linear negation in LL is never true in (game semantics of) ILL, IL or CL.
In search for the truly linear refinement of CL, we carve out (a sequent
calculus of) linear logic negative ($LL^-$) from (the two-sided sequent
calculus of) LL, and introducing a new distribution axiom $! ? A \vdash ? ! A$
(for a translation of sequents $\Delta \vdash \Gamma$ for CL into the sequents
$! \Delta \vdash ? \Gamma$ for $LL^-$). We then give a categorical semantics of
$LL^-$, for which we introduce why not monad ?, dual to the well-known of
course comonad !, giving a categorical translation $\Delta \rightarrow \Gamma =
? (\Delta \multimap \Gamma) \cong ! \Delta \multimap ? \Gamma$ of CL into
$LL^-$, which is the Kleisli extension of the standard translation $\Delta
\rightarrow \Gamma = ! \Delta \multimap \Gamma$ of IL into ILL. Moreover, we
instantiate the categorical semantics by fully complete (sequential,
unpolarized) game semantics of $LL^-$ (without atoms), for which we introduce
linearity of strategies.

composition and evolution of exoplanets. However, direct measurements of
exoplanetary mass and radius cannot be uniquely interpreted in terms of
interior structure, justifying the need for an additional observable. The
second degree fluid Love number, $k_2$, is proportional to the concentration of
mass towards the body's center, hence providing valuable additional information
about the internal structure. When hydrostatic equilibrium is assumed for the
planetary interior, $k_2$ is a direct function of the planetary shape. Previous
attempts were made to link the observed tidally and rotationally induced
planetary oblateness in photometric light curves to $k_2$ using ellipsoidal
shape models. Here, we construct an analytical 3D shape model function of the
true planetary mean radius, that properly accounts for tidal and rotational
deformations. Measuring the true planetary mean radius is critical when one
wishes to compare the measured $k_2$ to interior theoretical expectations. We
illustrate the feasibility of our method and show, by applying a Differential
Evolution Markov Chain to synthetic data of WASP-121b, that a precision $\leq$
65 ppm/$\sqrt{2\,min}$ is required to reliably retrieve $k_2$ with present
understanding of stellar limb darkening, therefore improving recent results
based on ellipsoidal shape models. Any improvement on stellar limb darkening
would increase such performance.

immediate progenitors of quiescent galaxies, although their origin and nature
are debated. Were they formed in slow secular processes or in rapid
merger-driven starbursts? Addressing this question would provide fundamental
insight into how quenching occurs. We explore the location of the general
population of galaxies with respect to fundamental star-forming and structural
relations, identify compact SFGs based on their stellar core densities, and
study three diagnostics of the burstiness of star formation: 1) Star formation
efficiency, 2) interstellar medium (ISM), and 3) radio emission. The overall
distribution of galaxies in the fundamental relations points towards a smooth
transition towards quiescence while galaxies grow their stellar cores, although
some galaxies suddenly increase their specific star-formation rate when they
become compact. From their star formation efficiencies compact and extended
SFGs appear similar. In relation to the ISM diagnostic, by studying the CO
excitation, the density of the neutral gas, and the strength of the ultraviolet
radiation field, compact SFGs resemble galaxies located in the upper envelope
of the SFGs main sequence, although yet based on a small sample size. Regarding
the radio emission diagnostic we find that galaxies become increasingly compact
as the starburst ages, implying that at least some compact SFGs are old
starbursts. We suggest that compact SFGs could be starburts winding down and
eventually crossing the main sequence towards quiescence.

high-resolution video streaming, and low latency wireless services. Demand for
such services is expected to growth rapid, which will require a search for
Beyond 5G technological advancements in wireless communications. Part of these
advancements is the need for additional spectrum, namely moving toward the
terahertz (THz) range. To compensate for the high path loss in THz, narrow
beamwidths are used to improve antenna gains. However, with narrow beamwidths,
even minor fluctuations in device location (such as through body movement) can
cause frequent link failures due to beam misalignment. In this paper, we
provide a solution to these small-scale indoor movement that result in
mobility-induced outages. Like a moth randomly flutters about, Mobility-induced
Outages in THz (MOTH) can be ephemeral in nature and hard to avoid. To deal
with MOTH we propose two methods to predict these outage scenarios: (i)
Align-After-Failure (AAF), which predicts based on fixed time margins, and (ii)
Align-Before-Failure (ABF), which learns the time margins through user mobility
patterns. In this paper, two different online classifiers were used to train
the ABF model to predicate if a mobility-induced outage is going to occur;
thereby, significantly reducing the time spent in outage scenarios. Simulation
results demonstrate a relationship between optimal beamwidth and human mobility
patterns. Additionally, to cater to a future with dense deployment of Wireless
Personal Area Network (WPAN), it is necessary that we have efficient deployment
of resources (e.g., THz-APs). One solution is to maximize the user coverage for
a single AP, which might be dependent on multiple parameters. We identify these
parameters and observe their tradeoffs for improving user coverage through a
single THz-AP.

Previously, the best known algorithm for this problem was a
$5.828$-approximation semi-streaming algorithm based on a local search
technique (Feldman et al., 2018). For the special case of this problem in which
the objective function is also monotone, the state-of-the-art semi-streaming
algorithm is an algorithm known as Sieve-Streaming, which is based on a
different technique (Badanidiyuru, 2014). Adapting the technique of
Sieve-Streaming to non-monotone objective functions has turned out to be a
challenging task, which has so far prevented an improvement over the local
search based $5.828$-approximation. In this work, we overcome the above
challenge, and manage to adapt Sieve-Streaming to non-monotone objective
functions by introducing a ""just right"" amount of randomness into it.
Consequently, we get a semi-streaming polynomial time $4.282$-approximation
algorithm for non-monotone objectives. Moreover, if one allows our algorithm to
run in super-polynomial time, then its approximation ratio can be further
improved to $3 + \varepsilon$.

  Topological Insulator BiSbTe$_{1.25}$Se$_{1.75}$ in Proximity with
  Superconducting NbSe$_2$","The combination of superconductivity and spin-momentum locking at the
interface between an s-wave superconductor and a three-dimensional topological
insulator (3D-TI) is predicted to generate exotic p-wave topological
superconducting phases that can host Majorana fermions. However, large bulk
conductivities of previously investigated 3D-TI samples and Fermi level
mismatches between 3D bulk superconductors and 2D topological surface states
have thwarted significant progress. Here we employ bulk insulating topological
insulators in proximity with two-dimensional superconductor NbSe$_2$ assembled
via Van der Waals epitaxy. Experimentally measured differential conductance
yields unusual features including a double-gap spectrum, an intrinsic asymmetry
that vanishes with small in-plane magnetic fields and differential conductance
ripples at biases significantly larger than the superconducting gap. We explain
our results on the basis of proximity induced superconductivity of topological
surface states, while also considering possibilities of topologically trivial
superconductivity arising from Rashba-type surface states. Our work
demonstrates the possibility of obtaining p-wave superconductors by proximity
effects on bulk insulating TIs.

require adding any stochastic processes to the standard dynamics. The
additional ingredient with respect to the wave function is a position in the
configuration space, which drives the collapse in a completely deterministic
way. This new variable is equivalent to a set of positions of all the
particles, i.e. a set of Bohmian positions, which obey the usual guiding
equation of Bohmian theory. Any superposition of quantum states of a
macroscopic object occupying different regions of space is projected by a
localization process onto the region occupied by the positions. Since the
Bohmian positions are well defined in a single realization of the experiment, a
space localization into one region is produced. The mechanism is based on the
correlations between these positions arising from the cohesive forces inside
macroscopic objects.
  The model introduces two collapse parameters, which play a very similar role
to those of the GRW and CSL theories. With appropriate values of these
parameters, we check that the corresponding dynamics rapidly projects
superpositions of macroscopic states localized in different regions of space
into a single region, while is keeps a negligible effect in all situations
where the predictions of standard quantum dynamics are known to be correct. The
possible relations with gravity are briefly speculated. We then study the
evolution of the density operator and a mean-field approximation of the
dynamical equations of this model, as well as the change of the evolution of
the momentum introduced by the localization process. Possible theoretical
interpretations are finally discussed. Generally speaking, this model
introduces a sharper border between the quantum and classical world than the
GRW and CSL theories, and leaves a broader range of acceptable values for the
parameters.

improve the efficiency of NAS, previous approaches adopt weight sharing method

observed that a model performing better with shared weights does not

  the Final Vacuum State","A semiclassical analysis shows that in the process of black hole formation
and evaporation, an initial pure state will evolve to a mixed state, i.e.,
information will be lost. One way of avoiding this conclusion without invoking
drastic modifications of the local laws of physics in a low curvature regime
would be for the information to be restored at the very end of the evaporation
process. It is normally envisioned that this would require a final burst of
particles entangled with the early time Hawking radiation. This would imply the
emission of an extremely large number of particles from an object of Planck
size and mass and would appear to be blatantly ruled out by energy
considerations. However, Hotta, Schutzhold, and Unruh have analyzed a
$(1+1)$-dimensional moving mirror analog of the Hawking process and have found
that, in this model, information is restored via entanglement of the early time
Hawking radiation with vacuum fluctuations in the spacetime region to the
future of the event where the mirror returns to inertial motion. We analyze
their model here and give a precise formulation of this entanglement by
introducing the notion of ""Milne particles."" We then analyze the inertial
particle and energy cost of such an entanglement of Hawking radiation with
vacuum fluctuations. We show that that, in fact, the entanglement of early time
Hawking radiation with vacuum fluctuations requires the emission of at least as
many late time inertial particles as Hawking particles. Although the energy
cost can be made small in the $(1+1)$-dimensional mirror system, this should
not be the case for the $(3+1)$-dimensional evaporating black hole system.
Thus, vacuum entanglement has the same difficulties as the more usual burst
scenarios for attempting to avoid information loss.

presence of M eavesdroppers that are also equipped with multiple antennas.
Among the remaining nodes, one jammer is randomly selected to transmit an
artificial noise to disrupt all the eavesdroppers that are attempting to
intercept the communication of the legitimate links i.e., S-R and R-D. The
received signals at each node are combined using maximal-ratio combining.
Secrecy analysis is provided by deriving closed-form and asymptotic expressions
for the secrecy outage probability. The impact of several key parameters on the
system's secrecy e.g., transmit power of the sources, number of eavesdroppers,
maximum tolerated interference power, and the number of diversity branches is
investigated. Importantly, by considering two scenarios, namely (i) absence and
(ii) presence of a friendly jammer, new insights are obtained for the
considered communication system. Especially, we tend to answer to the following
question: Can better secrecy be achieved without jamming by considering a
single antenna at eavesdroppers and multiple-ones at the legitimate users
(i.e., relay and end-user) rather than sending permanently an artificial noise
and considering that both the relay and the destination are equipped with a
single antenna, while multiple antennas are used by the eavesdroppers? The
obtained results are corroborated through Monte Carlo simulation and show that

parameters.

polarizing parties. We consider a network in which the leaders of one party are
given, and we pose the problem of selecting the leader set of the opposing
party so as to shift the average opinion to a desired value. When each party
has only one leader, we express the average opinion in terms of the transition
matrix and the stationary distribution of random walks in the network. The
analysis shows balance of influence between the two leader nodes. We show that
the problem of selecting at most $k$ absolute leaders to shift the average
opinion is $\mathbf{NP}$-hard. Then, we reduce the problem to a problem of
submodular maximization with a submodular knapsack constraint and an additional
cardinality constraint and propose a greedy algorithm with upper bound search
to approximate the optimum solution. We also conduct experiments in random
networks and real-world networks to show the effectiveness of the algorithm.

of lexical, syntactic, and semantic features, explicitly computed in a
pre-processing step. Training feature extraction models requires additional
annotated language resources, which severely restricts the applicability and
portability of relation extraction to novel languages. Similarly,
pre-processing introduces an additional source of error. To address these
limitations, we introduce TRE, a Transformer for Relation Extraction, extending
the OpenAI Generative Pre-trained Transformer [Radford et al., 2018]. Unlike
previous relation extraction models, TRE uses pre-trained deep language
representations instead of explicit linguistic features to inform the relation
classification and combines it with the self-attentive Transformer architecture
to effectively model long-range dependencies between entity mentions. TRE
allows us to learn implicit linguistic features solely from plain text corpora
by unsupervised pre-training, before fine-tuning the learned language
representations on the relation extraction task. TRE obtains a new
state-of-the-art result on the TACRED and SemEval 2010 Task 8 datasets,
achieving a test F1 of 67.4 and 87.1, respectively. Furthermore, we observe a
significant increase in sample efficiency. With only 20% of the training
examples, TRE matches the performance of our baselines and our model trained

  {\bf Theorem.} Let $f:\mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ be a $C^{1}$
function, so that $\nabla f$ is locally Lipschitz continuous. Assume moreover
that $f$ is $C^2$ near its generalised saddle points. Fix real numbers
$\delta_0>0$ and $0<\alpha <1$. Then there is a smooth function
$h:\mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow (0,\delta_0]$ so that the map
$H:\mathbb{R}^k\rightarrow \mathbb{R}^k$ defined by $H(x)=x-h(x)\nabla f(x)$
has the following property:
  (i) For all $x\in \mathbb{R}^k$, we have $f(H(x)))-f(x)\leq -\alpha
h(x)||\nabla f(x)||^2$.
  (ii) For every $x_0\in \mathbb{R}^k$, the sequence $x_{n+1}=H(x_n)$ either
satisfies $\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}||x_{n+1}-x_n||=0$ or $
\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}||x_n||=\infty$. Each cluster point of $\{x_n\}$ is a
critical point of $f$. If moreover $f$ has at most countably many critical
points, then $\{x_n\}$ either converges to a critical point of $f$ or
$\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}||x_n||=\infty$.
  (iii) There is a set $\mathcal{E}_1\subset \mathbb{R}^k$ of Lebesgue measure
$0$ so that for all $x_0\in \mathbb{R}^k\backslash \mathcal{E}_1$, the sequence
$x_{n+1}=H(x_n)$, {\bf if converges}, cannot converge to a {\bf generalised}

order to generate templates for reusable parse tree fragments, based on PoS
tags of bigrams and trigrams that demonstrate low variability in their
syntactic analyses from prior data. The aim of this approach is to improve the
speed of dependency parsers by avoiding redundant calculations. This can be
resolved by applying the predefined templates that capture results of previous
syntactic analyses and directly assigning the stored structure to a new n-gram
that matches one of the templates, instead of parsing a similar text fragment
again. The study shows that using a heuristic approach to select and reuse the
partial results increases parsing speed by reducing the input length to be
processed by a parser. The increase in parsing speed comes at some expense of
accuracy. Experiments on English show promising results: the input dimension
can be reduced by more than 20% at the cost of less than 3 points of Unlabeled

expectations with respect to some target distribution which \textit{adapt}
themselves to obtain better estimators over a sequence of iterations. Although
it is straightforward to show that they have the same $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$
convergence rate as standard importance samplers, where $N$ is the number of
Monte Carlo samples, the behaviour of adaptive importance samplers over the
number of iterations has been left relatively unexplored. In this work, we
investigate an adaptation strategy based on convex optimisation which leads to
a class of adaptive importance samplers termed \textit{optimised adaptive
importance samplers} (OAIS). These samplers rely on the iterative minimisation
of the $\chi^2$-divergence between an exponential-family proposal and the
target. The analysed algorithms are closely related to the class of adaptive
importance samplers which minimise the variance of the weight function. We
first prove non-asymptotic error bounds for the mean squared errors (MSEs) of
these algorithms, which explicitly depend on the number of iterations and the
number of samples together. The non-asymptotic bounds derived in this paper
imply that when the target belongs to the exponential family, the $L_2$ errors
of the optimised samplers converge to the optimal rate of
$\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ and the rate of convergence in the number of
iterations are explicitly provided. When the target does not belong to the
exponential family, the rate of convergence is the same but the asymptotic
$L_2$ error increases by a factor $\sqrt{\rho^\star} > 1$, where $\rho^\star -
1$ is the minimum $\chi^2$-divergence between the target and an
exponential-family proposal.

Simultaneously, the same deep network is trained to solve an additional
self-supervised task of predicting image rotations. This pushes the network to
learn more meaningful image representations that facilitate a better

understand how the diversity of possible planetary parameters affects the
climate of terrestrial planets. In this work, we investigate the atmospheric
circulation and climate of terrestrial exoplanets orbiting both Sun-like and
M-dwarf stars over a wide swath of possible planetary parameters, including the
planetary rotation period, surface pressure, incident stellar flux, surface
gravity, planetary radius, and cloud particle size. We do so using a general
circulation model (GCM) that includes non-grey radiative transfer and the
effects of clouds. The results from this suite of simulations generally show
qualitatively similar dependencies of circulation and climate on planetary
parameters as idealized GCMs, with quantitative differences due to the
inclusion of additional model physics. Notably, we find that the effective
cloud particle size is a key unknown parameter that can greatly affect the
climate of terrestrial exoplanets. We confirm a transition between low and high
dayside cloud coverage of synchronously rotating terrestrial planets with
increasing rotation period. We determine that this cloud transition is due to
eddy-driven convergence near the substellar point and should not be
parameterization-dependent. Finally, we compute full-phase light curves from
our simulations of planets orbiting M-dwarf stars, finding that changing
incident stellar flux and rotation period affect observable properties of
terrestrial exoplanets. Our GCM results can guide expectations for planetary
climate over the broad range of possible terrestrial exoplanets that will be

essential role in advancing our holistic understanding of exoplanetary systems.
The combination of orbital parameters from transit surveys and follow-up RV
measurements is vital to unlock mass and density estimates of detected planets,
giving us insight into their environment and structure. However, the exoplanet
field is reaching a critical juncture: the measurement sensitivity of existing
radial-velocity instruments is becoming the limiting factor in further
increasing our knowledge. Without improvement in delivered RV measurement
precision, we will not be able to provide dynamical mass and density estimates
for some of the most exciting (and consequently most challenging) discoveries
expected from new transit missions including the Transiting Exoplanet Survey
Satellite (TESS) (Plavchan et al. 2015, Ricker et al. 2014). RV precisions at
the 10cm/s level are required to fully confirm earth-like analogues, provide
masses and measure density to the 1-5% level from these missions. Additionally,
this RV capability will also be important to allow for efficient target
selection for facilities such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). A
promising way forward to achieve this goal is to use single-mode fibers to
inject light to a spectrograph. This mitigates many of the error terms facing
current generation seeing-limited RV instruments while simultaneously offering
the capability of high resolution spectroscopy within a small optical footprint
(Schwab et al. 2012, Crepp 2014, Jovanovic et al. 2016a). We discuss the
benefits of this technique, its challenges, and the current status of
development.

incorporate weight sharing -- a task of fundamental theoretical importance

results, each convolutional filter contributes only once to the bound,
regardless of how many times it is applied. Further improvements exploiting
pooling and sparse connections are provided. The presented bounds scale as the
norms of the parameter matrices, rather than the number of parameters. In
particular, contrary to bounds based on parameter counting, they are
asymptotically tight (up to log factors) when the weights approach
initialisation, making them suitable as a basic ingredient in bounds sensitive
to the optimisation procedure. We also show how to adapt the recent technique
of loss function augmentation to our situation to replace spectral norms by
empirical analogues whilst maintaining the advantages of our approach.

  Broadband corrugated horn construction and testing","The Baryon acoustic oscillations from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations
(BINGO) telescope is a 40-m~class radio telescope under construction that has
been designed to measure the large-angular-scale intensity of HI emission at
980--1260 MHz and hence to constrain dark energy parameters. A large focal
plane array comprising of 1.7-metre diameter, 4.3-metre length corrugated feed
horns is required in order to optimally illuminate the telescope. Additionally,
very clean beams with low sidelobes across a broad frequency range are
required, in order to facilitate the separation of the faint HI emission from
bright Galactic foreground emission. Using novel construction methods, a
full-sized prototype horn has been assembled. It has an average insertion loss
of around 0.15 dB across the band, with a return loss around -25 dB. The main
beam is Gaussian with the first sidelobe at around $-25 dB. A septum polariser
to separate the signal into the two hands of circular polarization has also
been designed, built and tested.

  Networked Systems","We study reinforcement learning (RL) in a setting with a network of agents
whose states and actions interact in a local manner where the objective is to
find localized policies such that the (discounted) global reward is maximized.
A fundamental challenge in this setting is that the state-action space size
scales exponentially in the number of agents, rendering the problem intractable
for large networks. In this paper, we propose a Scalable Actor-Critic (SAC)
framework that exploits the network structure and finds a localized policy that
is a $O(\rho^\kappa)$-approximation of a stationary point of the objective for
some $\rho\in(0,1)$, with complexity that scales with the local state-action
space size of the largest $\kappa$-hop neighborhood of the network.

  D6-branes","Employing new scanning methods, we revisit the systematic construction of
three-family $N=1$ supersymmetric Pati-Salam models in Type IIA orientifolds on
${\bf T}^6/(\mathbb Z_2\times \mathbb Z_2)$ with intersecting D6-branes.
Arising from the stacks of D6-branes with $U(n)$ gauge symmetries, the
Pati-Salam gauge symmetries $SU(4)_C\times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ can be
broken down to the Standard Model via D-brane splitting as well as D- and
F-flatness preserving Higgs mechanism. Also, the hidden sector contains
$USp(n)$ branes, which are parallel with the orientifold planes or their
${\mathbb Z_2}$ images. We find that the Type II T-duality in the previous
study is not an equivalent relation in Pati-Salam model building if the model
is not invariant under $SU(2)_L$ and $SU(2)_R$ exchange, and provides a way to
obtain new models. We systematically construct the new models with three
families, which usually do not have gauge coupling unification at the string
scale. We for the first time construct the Pati-Salam models with one wrapping
number equal to $5$. In particular, we find that these models carry more
refined gauge couplings, and thus with more possibility to have approximate
gauge coupling unification.

theoretically propose and experimentally demonstrate a class of resonances in
photonic crystal slabs, which only radiate towards a single side with no mirror
placed on the other side - we call them ``unidirectional bound states in the
continuum"". These resonances are found to emerge when a pair of half-integer
topological charges in the polarization field bounce into each other in the

telecommunication regime, where we achieve single-sided quality factor as high
as 1.6e5, equivalent to a radiation asymmetry ratio of 27.7 dB. Our work
represents a vivid example of applying topological principles to improve
optoelectronic devices. Possible applications of our work include grating

polytope can be used to analyze and compare the set of admissible forces of
different trajectories, but it can also be used to define metrics for solving
optimization problems, such as in trajectory optimization or system design. We
demonstrate how such a metric can be applied to trajectory optimization and
compare it against other objective functions typically used. Our results show
that the trajectories computed by optimizing objectives defined as functions of
the residual force polytope are more robust to unknown external disturbances.
The computational cost of these metrics is relatively high and not compatible

Lawrence Biedenharn to generalize quantum mechanics by passing from associative
matrix or operator algebras to non-associative algebras. We start with Jordan's
work from the early 1930ies leading to Jordan algebras and the first attempt to
incorporate the alternative ring of octonions into physics. Jordan's work on
the octonions from 1932 till 1952 will be covered, discussing aspects of the
exceptional Jordan algebra and how to express probabilities when working with
the octonions and the exceptional Jordan algebra. From the 1950ies onwards
Jordan and others also considered one-sided distributive systems like
near-fields, near-rings, quasi-fields and exceptional Segal systems (the last
two examples being not necessarily associative). As the set of non-linear
operators forms a near-ring and even a near-algebra, this may be of interest
for attempts to pass from a linear to a non-linear setting in the study of
quantum mechanics. Moreover, ideas introduced in the late 1960ies to use
non-power-associative algebras to formulate a theory of a minimal length will
be covered. Lawrence Biedenharn's and Jordan's ideas related to
non-power-associative octonionic matrix algebras will be briefly mentioned, a
long section is devoted to a summary of Horst R\""uhaak's PhD thesis from 1968
on matrix algebras over the octonions. Finally, recent attempts to use
non-associative algebras in physics will be described.

pulsars in the direction of the Galactic Centre (GC) have anomalous spin period
time derivative ($\dot P$) measurements -- PSRs J1748$-$3009, J1753$-$2819,
J1757$-$2745, and J1804$-$2858 show negative values of $\dot P$ and PSR
J1801$-$3210 is found to have an exceptionally small value of $\dot P$. We
attribute these observed $\dot P$ measurements to acceleration of these pulsars
along their lines-of-sight (LOSs) due to the Galactic gravitational field.
Using models of the Galactic mass distribution and pulsar velocities, we
constrain the distances to these pulsars, placing them on the far-side of the
Galaxy, providing the first accurate distance measurements to pulsars located
in this region and allowing us to consider the electron density along these
LOSs. We find the new electron density model YMW16 to be more consistent with
these observations than the previous model NE2001. The LOS dynamics further
constrain the model-dependent intrinsic $\dot P$ values for these pulsars and
they are consistent with measurements for other known pulsars. In the future,
the independent distance measurements to these and other pulsars near the GC
would allow us to constrain the Galactic gravitational potential more
accurately.

application of a single-electron source to metrological standards, quantum
information processing, including electron quantum optics, and quantum sensing.
While the dynamics of an electron emitted from the source has been extensively
studied, there is as yet no study of the dynamics inside the source. This is
because the speed of the internal dynamics is typically higher than 100 GHz,
beyond state-of-the-art experimental bandwidth. Here, we theoretically and
experimentally demonstrate that the internal dynamics in a silicon
singleelectron source comprising a dynamic quantum dot can be detected,
utilising a resonant level with which the dynamics is read out as
gate-dependent current oscillations. Our experimental observation and
simulation with realistic parameters show that an electron wave packet
spatially oscillates quantum-coherently at $\sim$ 200 GHz inside the source.
Our results will lead to a protocol for detecting such fast dynamics in a
cavity and offer a means of engineering electron wave packets. This could allow
high-accuracy current sources, high-resolution and high-speed
electromagnetic-field sensing, and high-fidelity initialisation of flying
qubits.

composite form in which the objective function is given by the sum of a smooth

nonsmooth setup. In this paper, we view proximal algorithms as dynamical
systems and leverage techniques from control theory to study their global
properties. In particular, for problems with strongly convex objective
functions, we utilize the theory of integral quadratic constraints to prove the
global exponential stability of the equilibrium points of the differential
equations that govern the evolution of proximal gradient and Douglas-Rachford
splitting flows. In our analysis, we use the fact that these algorithms can be
interpreted as variable-metric gradient methods on the suitable envelopes and
exploit structural properties of the nonlinear terms that arise from the
gradient of the smooth part of the objective function and the proximal operator
associated with the nonsmooth regularizer. We also demonstrate that these
envelopes can be obtained from the augmented Lagrangian associated with the
original nonsmooth problem and establish conditions for global exponential
convergence even in the absence of strong convexity.

function for the Delsarte type extremal problem $\mathcal{D}(W,Q)_G$. The
existence of the extremal function has recently been established by Berdysheva
and R\'ev\'esz in the most immediate case where $G=\mathbb{R}^d$. So the
novelty here is that we consider the problem in the general setting of locally
compact abelian groups. In this way our result provides a far reaching
generalization of the former work of Berdysheva and R\'ev\'esz.

digital image forensics, enabling the unique linkage of images to digital
cameras. This so-called camera fingerprint gives rise to different
applications, such as image forensics and authentication. However, if images
are publicly available, an adversary can estimate the fingerprint from her
victim and plant it into spurious images. The concept of fragile camera
fingerprints addresses this attack by exploiting asymmetries in data access:
While the camera owner will always have access to a full fingerprint from
uncompressed images, the adversary has typically access to compressed images
and thus only to a truncated fingerprint. The security of this defense,
however, has not been systematically explored yet. This paper provides the
first comprehensive analysis of fragile camera fingerprints under attack. A
series of theoretical and practical tests demonstrate that fragile camera
fingerprints allow a reliable device identification for common compression
levels in an adversarial environment.

estimate an X-ray recombination time of 2x10^7 yr, longer than the [OIII]

propose even N and equal individual DGDs, which allows the total PMDE to assume

relatively small; N = 2 seems acceptable. A variety of component and subsystem
suppliers is available, and the proposed PMDE is available on the market.

act as relays for messages sent by the primary user, hence offering performance
improvement of primary transmissions, while at the same time obtaining more
transmission opportunities for their own data. In particular, assuming the
broadcast packet erasure model with feedback, we investigate the capacity of
the fundamental cooperative cognitive radio network which consists of one
primary and one secondary transmitter-receiver pairs. The primary transmitter
is the owner of the channel and as such, we intend to keep its operations
simple and to avoid increasing its storage requirements. Specifically, the
primary transmitter does not receive data sent by the secondary transmitter and
does not perform any coding operations. On the other hand, the secondary
transmitter can overhear primary transmissions and is allowed to perform any
coding operations. We develop an outer bound to the capacity of the fundamental
cooperative cognitive radio network under consideration. Then, we propose a
coding-scheduling algorithm suitable for this type of networks, which involves
only XOR network coding operations. The complexity of the scheduling decisions
of the proposed algorithm depends on the channel statistical parameters and
three cases, depending on the relations between channel erasure probabilities,
are distinguished. For the first two cases the rate region of the proposed
algorithm coincides with the developed capacity outer bound, hence the
algorithm is capacity achieving. For the third case, the rate region of the
proposed algorithm is not identical to the outer bound; however, numerical
results show that it is fairly close to the derived outer bound for a wide
range of the statistical parameters of the system.

explicit dependency on various queue sizes aimed at modeling the stochastic
time evolution of a limit order book. The models we propose thus integrate the
influence of both the current book state and the past order flow. The first
variant considers the flow of order arrivals at a specific price level as
independent from the other one and describes this flow by adding a Hawkes
component to the arrival rates provided by the continuous time Markov ""Queue
Reactive"" model of Huang et al. Empirical calibration using Level-I order book
data from Eurex future assets (Bund and DAX) show that the Hawkes term
dramatically improves the pure ""Queue-Reactive"" model not only for the
description of the order flow properties (as e.g. the statistics of inter-event
times) but also with respect to the shape of the queue distributions. The
second variant we introduce describes the joint dynamics of all events
occurring at best bid and ask sides of some order book during a trading day.
This model can be considered as a queue dependent extension of the multivariate
Hawkes order-book model of Bacry et al. We provide an explicit way to calibrate
this model either with a Maximum-Likelihood method or with a Least-Square
approach. Empirical estimation from Bund and DAX level-I order book data allow
us to recover the main features of Hawkes interactions uncovered in Bacry et
al. but also to unveil their joint dependence on bid and ask queue sizes. We
notably find that while the market order or mid-price changes rates can mainly
be functions on the volume imbalance this is not the case for the arrival rate
of limit or cancel orders. Our findings also allows us to clearly bring to
light various features that distinguish small and large tick assets.

high girth: Let $k\geq 3$ and $c \in (0,1)$ be fixed. Let $n \in \mathbb{N}$ be

least $g-1$. If there are no such vertex pairs, abort. Otherwise, add the edge
$uv$ to $E(G)$.
  We show that with high probability this algorithm yields a $k$-regular graph

object but locate in different knowledge graphs (KGs), and has been harnessed
for KG construction and integration. When generating EA results, current
solutions treat entities independently and fail to take into account the
interdependence between entities. To fill this gap, we propose a collective EA
framework. We first employ three representative features, i.e., structural,
semantic and string signals, which are adapted to capture different aspects of
the similarity between entities in heterogeneous KGs. In order to make
collective EA decisions, we formulate EA as the classical stable matching
problem, which is further effectively solved by deferred acceptance algorithm.
Our proposal is evaluated on both cross-lingual and mono-lingual EA benchmarks
against state-of-the-art solutions, and the empirical results verify its
effectiveness and superiority.

bounds with the increase in population. Surveillance through computer vision
and expert decision making systems can help to understand the crowd phenomena
at large gatherings. Understanding crowd phenomena can be helpful in early
identification of unwanted incidents and their prevention. Motion flow is one
of the important crowd phenomena that can be instrumental in describing the
crowd behavior. Flows can be useful in understanding instabilities in the
crowd. However, extracting motion flows is a challenging task due to randomness
in crowd movement and limitations of the sensing device. Moreover, low-level
features such as optical flow can be misleading if the randomness is high. In
this paper, we propose a new model based on Langevin equation to analyze the
linear dominant flows in videos of densely crowded scenarios. We assume a force
model with three components, namely external force, confinement/drift force,
and disturbance force. These forces are found to be sufficient to describe the
linear or near-linear motion in dense crowd videos. The method is significantly
faster as compared to existing popular crowd segmentation methods. The
evaluation of the proposed model has been carried out on publicly available
datasets as well as using our dataset. It has been observed that the proposed
method is able to estimate and segment the linear flows in the dense crowd with
better accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art techniques with substantial
decrease in the computational overhead.

some parameter sets of the wave frequency and the angular velocity of the

  Graph","Explainability and effectiveness are two key aspects for building recommender
systems. Prior efforts mostly focus on incorporating side information to
achieve better recommendation performance. However, these methods have some
weaknesses: (1) prediction of neural network-based embedding methods are hard
to explain and debug; (2) symbolic, graph-based approaches (e.g., meta
path-based models) require manual efforts and domain knowledge to define
patterns and rules, and ignore the item association types (e.g. substitutable
and complementary). In this paper, we propose a novel joint learning framework
to integrate \textit{induction of explainable rules from knowledge graph} with
\textit{construction of a rule-guided neural recommendation model}. The
framework encourages two modules to complement each other in generating
effective and explainable recommendation: 1) inductive rules, mined from
item-centric knowledge graphs, summarize common multi-hop relational patterns
for inferring different item associations and provide human-readable
explanation for model prediction; 2) recommendation module can be augmented by
induced rules and thus have better generalization ability dealing with the
cold-start issue. Extensive experiments\footnote{Code and data can be found at:

achieved significant improvements in item recommendation over baselines on

magnetic origin, the one featuring disordered moments, and the other locally
nonmagnetic. We find that La there assumes an unusual valence of +2.6 to +2.7,
so that the effective doping is reduced to 0.30-0.35e. A closer look reveals
the same key elements: hole Fermi surfaces near Gamma-Z and electron ones near
the X-P lines, with the corresponding peak in susceptibility, and a strong
tendency to stripe magnetism. The physics of LaFe2As2 is thus more similar to
the FeBS paradigm than hitherto appreciated.

Supplementary X-ray data are used to investigate the hot gas in NGC 4666. We

The extended radio halo of NGC 4666 is box-shaped and is probably produced by
the previously observed supernova-driven superwind. This is supported by our
finding of an advective cosmic-ray transport such as that expected for a
galactic wind. The scaleheight analysis revealed an asymmetric halo above and

space and the observed return at each time step is an unknown linear function
of the chosen arm at that time step. In this paper, we investigate the problem
of learning the best arm in a linear stochastic bandit model, where each arm's
expected reward is an unknown linear function of the projection of the arm onto
a subspace. We call this the projection reward. Unlike the classical linear
bandit problem in which the observed return corresponds to the reward, the
projection reward at each time step is unobservable. Such a model is useful in
recommendation applications where the observed return includes corruption by
each individual's biases, which we wish to exclude in the learned model. In the
case where there are finitely many arms, we develop a strategy to achieve
$O(|\bbD|\log n)$ regret, where $n$ is the number of time steps and $|\bbD|$ is
the number of arms. In the case where each arm is chosen from an infinite
compact set, our strategy achieves $O(n^{2/3}(\log{n})^{1/2})$ regret.
Experiments verify the efficiency of our strategy.

using optical tweezers and assemble the atoms into a molecule. Our
demonstration includes 3D ground-state cooling of a single atom (Cs) in an
optical tweezer, transport by several microns with minimal heating, and merging
with a single Na atom. Subsequently, both atoms occupy the simultaneous
motional ground state with 61(4)\% probability. This realizes a sample of
exactly two co-trapped atoms near the phase-space-density limit of one, and
allows for efficient stimulated-Raman transfer of a pair of atoms into a
molecular bound state of the triplet electronic ground potential $a^3\Sigma^+$.
The results are key steps toward coherent creation of single ultracold

during early development. Determination of each cellular state, along with the
ratio of each cell type, as well as the developmental course during cell
differentiation are highly regulated processes that are robust to noise and
environmental perturbations throughout development. Waddington metaphorically
depicted this robustness as the epigenetic landscape in which the robustness of
each cellular state is represented by each valley in the landscape. This
robustness is now conceptualized as an approach toward an attractor in a
gene-expression dynamical system. However, there is still an incomplete
understanding of the origin of landscape change, which is accompanied by
branching of valleys that corresponds to the differentiation process. Recent
progress in developmental biology has unveiled the molecular processes involved
in epigenetic modification, which will be a key to understanding the nature of
slow landscape change. Nevertheless, the contribution of the interplay between
gene expression and epigenetic modification to robust landscape changes, known
as homeorhesis, remains elusive. Here, we introduce a theoretical model that
combines epigenetic modification with gene expression dynamics driven by a
regulatory network. In this model, epigenetic modification changes the
feasibility of expression, i.e., the threshold for expression dynamics, and a
slow positive-feedback process from expression to the threshold level is
introduced. Under such epigenetic feedback, several fixed-point attractors with
distinct expression patterns are generated hierarchically shaping the
epigenetic landscape with successive branching of valleys. This theory provides
a quantitative framework for explaining homeorhesis in development as
postulated by Waddington, based on dynamical-system theory with slow feedback
reinforcement.

To verify the validity of this method, we apply it to an $S=1/2$ XXZ

numerical diagonalization. As a result, the anomaly of $\chi$ and $A$ exists at
zero magnetization. That of $A$ is easier to observe than that of $\chi$, which
indicates that the observation of $A$ is a more efficient method to evaluate an

shape-based approach embedded in machine learning to autonomously detect
earthquakes. It promises to overcome the challenges in the field of seismology
related to automated detection and cataloging of earthquakes. EQShapelets are
amplitude and phase-independent, i.e., their detection sensitivity is
irrespective of the magnitude of the earthquake and the time of occurrence.
They are also robust to noise and other spurious signals. The detection
capability of EQShapelets is tested on one week of continuous seismic data
provided by the Northern California Seismic Network (NCSN) obtained from a
station in central California near the Calaveras Fault. EQShapelets combined
with a Random Forest classifier, detected all of the cataloged earthquakes and
281 uncataloged events with lower false detection rate thus offering a better
performance than autocorrelation and FAST algorithms. The primary advantage of
EQShapelets over competing methods is the interpretability and insight it
offers. Shape-based approaches are intuitive, visually meaningful and offers
immediate insight into the problem domain that goes beyond their use in
accurate detection. EQShapelets, if implemented at a large scale, can
significantly reduce catalog completeness magnitudes and can serve as an
effective tool for near real-time earthquake monitoring and cataloging.

modes evolve according to a time dependent linear Hamiltonian system. We then
control the global dynamics by using polynomial growth estimates for high modes
and the preservation of Sobolev norms for the low modes. Our general strategy
applies to any semi-linear Hamiltonian PDEs whose linear frequencies satisfy a

structures with tuneable porosity is of paramount relevance for many practical
applications: surfaces with regular arrays of pores can be used for selective
adsorption or immobilization of guest units that are complementary in shape
and/or size to the pores, thus achieving, for instance, selective filtering or
well-defined responses to external stimuli. The principles that govern the
formation of such structures are valid at both the molecular and the colloidal
scale. Here we provide simple design directions to combine the anisotropic
shape of the building units -- either molecules or colloids -- and selective
directional bonding. Using extensive computer simulations we show that regular
rhombic platelets decorated with attractive and repulsive interaction sites
lead to specific tilings, going smoothly from close-packed arrangements to open
lattices. The rationale behind the rich tiling scenario observed can be
described in terms of steric incompatibilities, unsatisfied bonding geometries
and interplays between local and long-range order.

wireless data aggregation via exploiting the superposition property in a
multiple access channel. To further overcome the unfavorable signal propagation
conditions for AirComp, in this paper, we propose an intelligent reflecting
surface (IRS) aided AirComp system to build controllable wireless environments,
thereby boosting the received signal power significantly. This is achieved by
smartly tuning the phase shifts for the incoming electromagnetic waves at IRS,
resulting in reconfigurable signal propagations. Unfortunately, it turns out
that the joint design problem for AirComp transceivers and IRS phase shifts
becomes a highly intractable nonconvex bi-quadratic programming problem, for
which a novel alternating difference-of-convex (DC) programming algorithm is
developed. This is achieved by providing a novel DC function representation for
the rank-one constraint in the low-rank matrix optimization problem via matrix
lifting. Simulation results demonstrate the algorithmic advantages and
admirable performance of the proposed approaches compared with the state-of-art
solutions.

scalability of blockchain. By composing multiple parallel chain instances, the
whole systems' throughput can approach the network capacity. How to coordinate
different chains' blocks and to construct them into a global ordering is
critical to the performance of parallel chain protocol. However, the existed
solutions use either the global synchronization clock with the single-chain
bottleneck or pre-defined ordering sequences with distortion of blocks'
causality to order blocks. In addition, the prior ordering methods rely on that
honest participants faithfully follow the ordering protocol, but remain silent
for any denial of ordering (DoR) attack.
  On the other hand, the conflicting transactions included into the global
block sequence will make Simple Payment Verification (SPV) difficult. Clients
usually need to store a full record of transactions to distinguish the
conflictions and tell whether transactions are confirmed. However, the
requirement for a full record will greatly hinder blockchains' application,
especially for mobile scenarios.
  In this technical report, we propose Eunomia, which leverages logical clock
and fine-grained UTXO sharding to realize a simple, efficient, secure and
permissionless parallel chain protocol. By observing the characteristics of the
parallel chain, we find the blocks ordering issue in parallel chain has many
similarities with the event ordering in the distributed system. Eunomia thus
adopts ""virtual"" logical clock, which is optimized to have the minimum protocol
overhead and runs in a distributed way. In addition, Eunomia combines the
mining incentive with block ordering, providing incentive compatibility against
DoR attack. What's more, the fine-grained UTXO sharding does well solve the
conflicting transactions in parallel chain and is shown to be SPV-friendly.

on the observation that the lane is a small-size and narrow-width object in a

Degressive Dilation Block (DD Block). The FSS allows a network to extract thin
lane features using appropriate feature sizes. To acquire fine-grained spatial
information, the DD Block is made of a series of dilated convolutions with
degressive dilation rates. Experimental results show that the proposed

cosmological parameters. Assuming a $\Lambda$CDM cosmology including massive
neutrinos, we find that the latest SDSS DR14 BOSS and eBOSS Ly-$\alpha$ forest
data is in very good agreement with current weak lensing constraints on
$(\Omega_m, \sigma_8)$ and has the same small level of tension with Planck. We
did not identify a systematic effect in the data analysis that could explain
this small tension, but we show that it can be reduced in extended cosmological
models where the spectral index is not the same on the very different times and
scales probed by CMB and Ly-$\alpha$ data. A particular case is that of a
$\Lambda$CDM model including a running of the spectral index on top of massive
neutrinos. With combined Ly-$\alpha$ and Planck data, we find a slight
(3$\sigma$) preference for negative running, $\alpha_s= -0.010 \pm 0.004$ (68%
CL). Neutrino mass bounds are found to be robust against different assumptions.
In the $\Lambda$CDM model with running, we find $\sum m_\nu <0.11$ eV at the
95% confidence level for combined Ly-$\alpha$ and Planck (temperature and
polarisation) data, or $\sum m_\nu < 0.09$ eV when adding CMB lensing and BAO
data. We further provide strong and nearly model-independent bounds on the mass

temporal variability will inform models and identify physical processes
occurring at either length scales too small to directly observe or at pressure
levels that are inaccessible to transit observations. We do not detect
statistically significant variability and are able to place useful upper limits
on the IR variability amplitudes in these atmospheres. There are very few
planets with multi-epoch observations at the required precision to probe
variability in dayside emission. The observations considered in this study span
several years, providing insight into temporal variability at multiple
timescales. In the case of HD 189733b, the best fit eclipse depths for the
channel 2 observations exhibit a scatter of 102 ppm about a median depth of
1827 ppm and in channel 1 exhibit a scatter of 88 ppm about a median depth of
1481 ppm. For HD 209458b, the best fit eclipse depths for the channel 2
observations exhibit a scatter of 22 ppm about a median depth of 1406 ppm and
in channel 1 exhibit a scatter of 131 ppm about a median depth of 1092 ppm. The
precision and scatter in these observations allow us to constrain variability
to less than (5.6% and 6.0%) and (12% and 1.6%) for channels (1,2) of HD
189733b and HD 209458b respectively. There is a difference in the best fit

  Years of Data from the IceCube Observatory","The measurement of diffuse PeV gamma-ray emission from the Galactic plane
would provide information about the energy spectrum and propagation of Galactic
cosmic rays, and the detection of a point-like source of PeV gamma rays would
be strong evidence for a Galactic source capable of accelerating cosmic rays up
to at least a few PeV. This paper presents several un-binned maximum likelihood
searches for PeV gamma rays in the Southern Hemisphere using 5 years of data
from the IceTop air shower surface detector and the in-ice array of the IceCube
Observatory. The combination of both detectors takes advantage of the low muon
content and deep shower maximum of gamma-ray air showers, and provides
excellent sensitivity to gamma rays between $\sim$0.6 PeV and 100 PeV. Our
measurements of point-like and diffuse Galactic emission of PeV gamma rays are
consistent with background, so we constrain the angle-integrated diffuse
gamma-ray flux from the Galactic Plane at 2 PeV to $2.61 \times 10^{-19}$
cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ TeV$^{-1}$ at 90% confidence, assuming an E$^{-3}$ spectrum,
and we estimate 90% upper limits on point-like emission at 2 PeV between
10$^{-21}$ - 10$^{-20}$ cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ TeV$^{-1}$ for an E$^{-2}$ spectrum,
depending on declination. Furthermore, we exclude unbroken power-law emission
up to 2 PeV for several TeV gamma-ray sources observed by H.E.S.S., and
calculate upper limits on the energy cutoffs of these sources at 90%
confidence. We also find no PeV gamma rays correlated with neutrinos from
IceCube's high-energy starting event sample. These are currently the strongest
constraints on PeV gamma-ray emission.

nonparametric (auto-) regression function and give a consistency result. The
method of proof also allows for different kinds of functionals such that
Cram\'er-von Mises type estimators can be considered similarly. The approach

  Spray Aerosol Production: Multisensor Field Observations","Simultaneous measurements of sea spray aerosol (SSA), wind, wave, underwater
acoustic noise, and microwave brightness temperature are obtained in the open
ocean. These data are analyzed to clarify the ocean surface processes important
to SSA production. Parameters are formulated to represent surface processes
with characteristic length scales over a broad range, from tens of meters to a
few centimeters. The result shows that the correlation coefficients between SSA
properties (number, volume and flux) and surface process parameters improve
toward the shortest length scale. This suggests that whereas surface wave
breaking is a necessary initial and boundary condition, the final state of the
atmospheric SSA properties is controlled primarily by turbulent processes
characterized by the ocean surface roughness. The investigation also reveals
distinct differences of the SSA properties in rising winds and falling winds,
with higher efficiency of breaking production in low or falling winds. Previous
studies show that the length scale of breaking waves is shorter in mixed seas
than in wind seas. Combining the observations together, it is suggestive that
larger air cavities are entrained in rising winds (with wind seas more likely).
The larger air cavities escape before they can be fully broken down into small
bubbles for the subsequent SSA production. In contrast, the shorter breakers in
low or falling winds (with mixed seas more likely) trap smaller air cavities
that stay underwater longer for more efficient bubble breakup by turbulence.

  Planner","Autonomous cars are subjected to several different kind of inputs (other
cars, road structure, etc.) and, therefore, testing the car under all possible
conditions is impossible. To tackle this problem, scenario-based testing for
automated driving defines categories of different scenarios that should be
covered. Although this kind of coverage is a necessary condition, it still does
not guarantee that any possible behaviour of the autonomous car is tested. In
this paper, we consider the path planner of an autonomous car that decides, at
each timestep, the short-term path to follow in the next few seconds; such
decision is done by using a weighted cost function that considers different
aspects (safety, comfort, etc.). In order to assess whether all the possible
decisions that can be taken by the path planner are covered by a given test
suite T, we propose a mutation-based approach that mutates the weights of the
cost function and then checks if at least one scenario of T kills the mutant.
Preliminary experiments on a manually designed test suite show that some
weights are easier to cover as they consider aspects that more likely occur in

crystal($\text{H}_2\text{C}_4\text{O}_4$). We take into account the four-spin
interaction model at the zeroth order. Using an improvised loop algorithm
within the Stochastic series expansion quantum monte carlo method, we find two
distinct phases as we increase the temperature and magnetic-field. One of the
phase is the $\Pi_f$, the phase with long range ferroelectric order and the
other being an intermediate state with strong local correlations, i.e, a
quantum liquid-like state $\Pi_{ql}$. The transition to $\Pi_{f}$ shows a very
small anomalous peak in the specific heat with strong dependence of critical
temperature on the strength of dipole-dipole interaction. The presence of the
small peak is attributed to the absence of macroscopic degeneracy in the
presence of dipole-dipole interaction and re-entrance of such degeneracy to
some extent at small temperature. Though the degenerate ground state manifold
is identical for a four-spin interaction or appropriate two-spin interaction
model at zeroth order, we find that for the former case, the required strength
of dipole-dipole interaction is quite larger to induce a ferroelectric phase.
The work also presents an intricate connection of quantum fluctuation and
thermal fluctuation in the presence of competing interaction with entropic

to the well-known vanishing gradient problem. Some architectures incorporate
methods to reduce RNN state updates, therefore allowing the network to preserve
memory over long temporal intervals. To address these problems of convergence,
this paper proposes a timing-gated LSTM RNN model, called the Gaussian-gated
LSTM (g-LSTM). The time gate controls when a neuron can be updated during
training, enabling longer memory persistence and better error-gradient flow.
This model captures long-temporal dependencies better than an LSTM and the time
gate parameters can be learned even from non-optimal initialization values.
Because the time gate limits the updates of the neuron state, the number of
computes needed for the network update is also reduced. By adding a
computational budget term to the training loss, we can obtain a network which
further reduces the number of computes by at least 10x. Finally, by employing a
temporal curriculum learning schedule for the g-LSTM, we can reduce the
convergence time of the equivalent LSTM network on long sequences.

allows a search over the uncertainty region produced by MOST. However, the TESS
pixel scale of 21"" and the Full Frame Image (FFI) cadence of 30 minutes is not
optimal for the detection of an FOB with a possible millisecond duration. We
search the TESS FFIs and find no events with a limiting TESS magnitude of 16,
assuming a 30 minute event duration, corresponding to an optical flux density
upper limit of approximately 2000 Jy for a ~ms signal duration, assuming no

significantly reduces its sensitivity to short timescale transients, which we
quantify. We compare our results to the predictions of Yang, Zhang, and Wei

the predicted maximum optical flux density. However, we find that if FRB181228

  Transform and Motif-based Graph Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network","Traffic forecasting is crucial for urban traffic management and guidance.
However, existing methods rarely exploit the time-frequency properties of
traffic speed observations, and often neglect the propagation of traffic flows
from upstream to downstream road segments. In this paper, we propose a hybrid
approach that learns the spatio-temporal dependency in traffic flows and
predicts short-term traffic speeds on a road network. Specifically, we employ
wavelet transform to decompose raw traffic data into several components with
different frequency sub-bands. A Motif-based Graph Convolutional Recurrent
Neural Network (Motif-GCRNN) and Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARMA) are used
to train and predict low-frequency components and high-frequency components,
respectively. In the Motif-GCRNN framework, we integrate Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCNs) with local sub-graph structures - Motifs - to capture the
spatial correlations among road segments, and apply Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) to extract the short-term and periodic patterns in traffic speeds.
Experiments on a traffic dataset collected in Chengdu, China, demonstrate that
the proposed hybrid method outperforms six state-of-art prediction methods.

Autoencoder (VAE) on a highly imbalanced data set. The proposed training of a
high-resolution VAE model begins with the training of a low-resolution core
model, which can be successfully trained on imbalanced data set. In subsequent
training steps, new convolutional, upsampling, deconvolutional, and
downsampling layers are iteratively attached to the model. In each iteration,
the additional layers are trained based on the intermediate pretrained model -
a result of previous training iterations. Thus, the resolution of the model is
progressively increased up to the required resolution level. In this paper, the
progressive VAE training is exploited for learning a latent representation with
imbalanced, highly sparse data sets and, consequently, generating routes in a
constrained 2D space. Routing problems (e.g., vehicle routing problem,
travelling salesman problem, and arc routing) are of special significance in
many modern applications (e.g., route planning, network maintenance, developing
high-performance nanoelectronic systems, and others) and typically associated
with sparse imbalanced data. In this paper, the critical problem of routing
billions of components in nanoelectronic devices is considered. The proposed
approach exhibits a significant training speedup as compared with
state-of-the-art existing VAE training methods, while generating expected image
outputs from unseen input data. Furthermore, the final progressive VAE models
exhibit much more precise output representation, than the Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) models trained with comparable training time. The
proposed method is expected to be applicable to a wide range of applications,
including but not limited image impainting, sentence interpolation, and
semi-supervised learning.

coalescence of compact object binaries are believed to be powerful sources of
gravitational waves (GWs). In the collapsar scenario, a rotating stellar-mass
black hole (BH) surrounded by a hyperaccretion disk might be running in the
center of a massive collapsar, which is one of the plausible central engines of
long GRBs. Such a BH hyperaccretion disk would be in a state of a
neutrino-dominated accretion flow (NDAF) at the initial stage of the accretion
process; meanwhile, the jets attempt to break out from the envelope and
circumstellar medium to power GRBs. In addition to collapsars, the BH
hyperaccretion systems are important sources of neutrinos and GWs. In this
paper, we investigated the GW emission generated by the anisotropic neutrino
emission from NDAFs in the collapsar scenarios. As the results indicate, the
typical frequency of GWs is $\sim$ 1-100 Hz, and the masses and metallicities
of the progenitor stars have slight effects on the GW strains. The GWs from
NDAFs might be detected by operational or planned detectors at the distance of
10 kpc. Moreover, comparisons of the detectable GWs from collapsars, NDAFs, and
GRB jets (internal shocks) are displayed. By combining the electromagnetic

are ubiquitously observed in the long-time behavior of a wide variety of
systems. Here, the manner by which such systems evolve towards their asymptotic
superdiffusive behavior is explored using the 1d L\'evy walk of order $1 <
\beta < 2$. The approach towards superdiffusion, as captured by the leading
correction to the asymptotic behavior, is shown to remarkably undergo a
transition as $\beta$ crosses the critical value $\beta_{c} = 3/2$. Above
$\beta_{c}$, this correction scales as $\lvert x \rvert \sim t^{1/2}$,
describing simple diffusion. However, below $\beta_{c}$ it is instead found to
remain superdiffusive, scaling as $\lvert x \rvert \sim t^{1/(2\beta-1)}$. This
transition is shown to be independent of the precise model details and is thus
argued to be universal.

leading to a self-assembled array of quasi-one-dimensional superfluids. These
bosonic superstripes turn into an isotropic supersolid with decreasing the

methodology fits control architectures where the Divergent-Component-of-Motion

key idea for the design of the step adapter is to impose both initial and final
DCM step values using an exponential interpolation of the time varying ZMP
trajectory.This allows us to cast the push recovery problem as a Quadratic
Programming (QP) one, and to solve it online with state-of-the-art optimisers.
The overall approach is validated with simulations of the torque-controlled 33

between two saddle periodic orbits with unstable manifolds of different
dimensions. Recent theoretical work on chaotic dynamics beyond the uniformly
hyperbolic setting has shown that heterodimensional cycles may occur robustly
in diffeomorphisms of dimension at least three. We study a concrete example of
a heterodimensional cycle in the continuous-time setting, specifically in a
four-dimensional vector field model of intracellular calcium dynamics. By
employing advanced numerical techniques, Zhang, Krauskopf and Kirk [Discr.
Contin. Dynam. Syst. A 32(8) 2825--2851 (2012)] found that a heterodimensional
cycle exists in this model.
  We investigate the geometric structure of the associated stable and unstable
manifolds in the neighbourhood of this heterodimensional cycle, consisting of a
single connecting orbit of codimension one and an entire cylinder of
structurally stable connecting orbits between two saddle periodic orbits. We
employ a boundary-value problem set-up to compute their stable and unstable
manifolds, which we visualize in different projections of phase space and as
intersection sets with a suitable three-dimensional Poincar\'e section. We show
that, locally near the intersection set of the heterodimensional cycle, the
manifolds interact as described by the theory for three-dimensional
diffeomorphisms. On the other hand, their global structure is more intricate,
which is due to the fact that it is not possible to find a Poincar\'e section
that is transverse to the flow everywhere. Our results show that the abstract
concept of a heterodimensional cycle arises and can be studied in
continuous-time models from applications.

results in non-monotonic polymer length and membrane charge dependence of the

nodes, and edges and their properties such as their community structure, which
play an important role in dictating the robustness of the network towards
structural perturbations. Specifically, we want to identify all vital nodes,
which when removed would lead to a large change in the underlying community
structure of the network. This problem is extremely important because the
community structure of a network allows deep underlying insights into how
function of a network and its topology affect each other. Moreover, it even
provides a way to condense large graphs into smaller graphs where each
community acts as a meta node and hence aids in easier network analysis. If
this community structure was to be compromised by either accidental or
intentional perturbations to the network, that would make such analysis
difficult. Since the problem of identifying such vital nodes is computationally
intractable, we propose some heuristics that allow us to find solutions close
to the optimal solution. To certify the effectiveness of our approach, we first
test these heuristics on small networks, and then move to larger networks to
show that we achieve similar results. The results reveal that the proposed
approaches are effective to analyze the vulnerability of communities in graphs
irrespective of their size and scale. From the application point of view, we
show that the proposed algorithm is scalable and can be applied to the
information diffusion task to curtail the spread of active nodes which was
observed empirically. Additionally, we show the performance of our algorithm

information diffusion, and show that the effect of our algorithm on these tasks

scheduling machine problems. In particular, we show strong NP-hardness of the
case of unit resource requirements and weights ($1|rm=1,a_j=1|\sum C_j$), thus
answering an open question of Gy\""orgyi and Kis. We also prove that the
schedule corresponding to the Shortest Processing Time First ordering provides
a $3/2$-approximation for the same problem. We give simple constant factor
approximations and a more complicated PTAS for the case of $0$ processing times
($1|rm=1,p_j=0|\sum w_jC_j$). We close the paper by proposing a new variant of
the problem in which the resource arrival times are unknown. A
$4$-approximation is presented for this variant, together with an
$(4-\varepsilon)$-inapproximability result.

  Operational Challenges for Lab-Scale, Continuous Flow Reactors","Optimizing an industrial-scale supercritical water gasification process
requires detailed knowledge of chemical reaction pathways, rates, and product
yields. Laboratory-scale reactors are employed to develop this knowledge base.
The rationale behind designs and component selection of continuous flow,
laboratory-scale supercritical water gasification reactors is analyzed. Some
design challenges have standard solutions, such as pressurization and
preheating, but issues with solid precipitation and feedstock pretreatment
still present open questions. Strategies for reactant mixing must be evaluated
on a system-by-system basis, depending on feedstock and experimental goals, as
mixing can affect product yields, char formation, and reaction pathways.
In-situ Raman spectroscopic monitoring of reaction chemistry promises to
further fundamental knowledge of gasification and decrease experimentation
time. High-temperature, high-pressure spectroscopy in supercritical water
conditions is performed, however, long-term operation flow cell operation is
challenging. Comparison of Raman spectra for decomposition of formic acid in
the supercritical region and cold section of the reactor demonstrates the
difficulty in performing quantitative spectroscopy in the hot zone. Future
designs and optimization of SCWG reactors should consider well-established
solutions for pressurization, heating, and process monitoring, and effective
strategies for mixing and solids handling for long-term reactor operation and
data collection.

chromo-magnetic interaction, which breaks both symmetries, is located at least
predominantly in the near - zero modes. Using as a tool the expansion of

executes Grover's algorithm on a subspace of permutationally symmetric states,
a target entangled resource state can be prepared using $O(N^{5/4})$ geometric

the gates are insensitive to the initial state of the mode and the sequence has
built-in dynamical decoupling providing resilience to dephasing errors.

  Efimov trimers","Small weakly-bound droplets determine a number of properties of ultracold
Bose and Fermi gases. For example, Efimov trimers near the atom-atom-atom and
atom-dimer thresholds lead to enhanced losses from bosonic clouds.
Generalizations to four- and higher-body systems have also been considered.
Moreover, Efimov trimers have been predicted to play a role in the Bose polaron
with large boson-impurity scattering length. Motivated by these considerations,
the present work provides a detailed theoretical analysis of weakly-bound
$N$-body clusters consisting of $N-1$ identical bosons (denoted by ""B"") of mass
$m$ that interact with a single distinguishable impurity particle (denoted by
""X"") of mass $M$. The system properties are analyzed as a function of the mass
ratio $\kappa$ (values from $\kappa=1$ to $50$ are considered), where $\kappa$
is equal to $m/M$, and the two-body $s$-wave scattering length $a_{\text{BX}}$
between the bosons and the impurity. To reach the universal Efimov regime in
which the size of the BBX trimer as well as those of larger clusters is much
larger than the length scales of the underlying interaction model, three
different approaches are considered: resonance states are determined in the
absence of BB and BBX interactions, bound states are determined in the presence
of repulsive three-body boson-boson-impurity interactions, and bound states are
determined in the presence of repulsive two-body boson-boson interactions. The
universal regime, in which the details of the underlying interaction model
become irrelevant, is identified.

  post-common-envelope binaries for solar mass secondaries","Eclipsing time variations have been observed for a wide range of binary
systems, including post-common-envelope binaries. A frequently proposed
explanation, apart from the possibility of having a third body, is the effect
of magnetic activity, which may alter the internal structure of the secondary
star, particularly its quadrupole moment, and thereby cause quasi-periodic
oscillations. Here we present two compressible non-ideal magneto-hydrodynamical
(MHD) simulations of the magnetic dynamo in a solar mass star, one of them with
three times the solar rotation rate (""slow rotator""), the other one with twenty
times the solar rotation rate (""rapid rotator""), to account for the high
rotational velocities in close binary systems. For the slow rotator, we find
that both the magnetic field and the stellar quadrupole moment change in a
quasi-periodic manner, leading to O-C (observed - corrected times of the
eclipse) variations of ~0.025 s. For the rapid rotator, the behavior of the
magnetic field as well as the quadrupole moment changes become considerably
more complex, due to the less coherent dynamo solution. The resulting O-C
variations are of the order 0.13 s. The observed system V471~Tau shows two
modes of eclipsing time variations, with amplitudes of 151 s and 20 s,
respectively. However, the current simulations may not capture all relevant
effects due to the neglect of the centrifugal force and self-gravity.
Considering the model limitations and that the rotation of V471 Tau is still a
factor of 2.5 faster than our rapid rotator, it may be conceivable to reach the
observed magnitudes.

It detects neutrinos via Cherenkov light of charged relativistic particles from
neutrino interactions with the detector volume. IceCube is, due to its size and

enhanced high-energy neutrino flux from dark matter annihilation inside the Sun
compared to models without a mediator. Neutrino signals that are produced
directly inside the Sun are strongly attenuated at higher energies due to
interactions with the solar plasma. In the models considered here, the mediator
can escape the Sun before producing any neutrinos, thereby avoiding
attenuation. IceCube is ideal to search for this enhanced high-energy neutrino
signal. We present the sensitivities of an analysis of six years of IceCube

patch-based high-resolution 3D CNN methods have been the de facto standard
solutions. 3D patch-based high resolution methods typically yield superior
performance among CNN approaches on detailed whole brain segmentation (>100

multi-atlas segmentation methods (MAS) due to the following challenges: (1) a
single network is typically used to learn both spatial and contextual

multiple spatially distributed networks were used in the SLANT method, in which
each network learned contextual information for a fixed spatial location. To
address the second challenge, auxiliary labels on 5111 initially unlabeled

integrated multiple traditional medical image processing methods with deep

  Attentive Cont-conv Fusion Module","LIDAR point clouds and RGB-images are both extremely essential for 3D object
detection. So many state-of-the-art 3D detection algorithms dedicate in fusing
these two types of data effectively. However, their fusion methods based on
Birds Eye View (BEV) or voxel format are not accurate. In this paper, we
propose a novel fusion approach named Point-based Attentive Cont-conv
Fusion(PACF) module, which fuses multi-sensor features directly on 3D points.
Except for continuous convolution, we additionally add a Point-Pooling and an
Attentive Aggregation to make the fused features more expressive. Moreover,
based on the PACF module, we propose a 3D multi-sensor multi-task network
called Pointcloud-Image RCNN(PI-RCNN as brief), which handles the image
segmentation and 3D object detection tasks. PI-RCNN employs a segmentation
sub-network to extract full-resolution semantic feature maps from images and
then fuses the multi-sensor features via powerful PACF module. Beneficial from
the effectiveness of the PACF module and the expressive semantic features from
the segmentation module, PI-RCNN can improve much in 3D object detection. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the PACF module and PI-RCNN on the KITTI 3D
Detection benchmark, and our method can achieve state-of-the-art on the metric

  presence or absence of vortices -- Comparison with ALMA observations","A massive planet in a protoplanetary disc will open a gap in the disc
material. A steep gap edge can be hydrodynamically unstable, which results in
the formation of vortices that can act as tracers for the presence of planets
in observational results. However, in a viscous disc, the potential formation
of these vortices is dependent on the timescale over which the massive planet
accretes mass and with a sufficiently long timescale it is possible for no
vortices to form. Hence, there is a connection between the presence of vortices
and the growth timescale of the planet and it may therefore be possible to
exclude a planetary interpretation of observed structure from the absence of
vortices. We have investigated the effect of the planet growth timescale on
vortex formation for a range of planet masses and viscosities and have found an
approximate relation between the planet mass, viscosity and planet growth
timescale for which vortices are not formed within the disc. We then interpret
these results in the light of recent observations. We have also found that
planets do not need to be close to a Jupiter mass to form vortices in the disc
if these discs have low viscosity, as these can be caused by planets as small
as a few Neptune masses.

for the vortex core velocity and mass, where they mainly depend on Rabi
coupling and the relative distance between the vortex cores in photon and
exciton fields, and as the result core positions oscillate in each field. We
use Magnus force balanced with a Rabi induced force to show that the core of
the vortex behaves as an inertial-like particle. Our analysis reveals that the
core is lighter at periphery of the beam and therefore it is faster at that
region. While detuning induces oscillations in population imbalance of
components through relative phase between coupled fields, in the presence of
topological charges detuning can control the orbital dynamics of the cores.
Namely, it brings the vortex core to move on larger or smaller orbits with
different velocities, and changes angular momentum and energy content of vortex
field.

value-of-information criterion with respect to this divergence. Optimizing the
criterion leads to a probabilistic partitioning of the states in the high-order
Markov chain. A single free parameter that emerges through the optimization
process dictates both the partition uncertainty and the number of state groups.

achievable one. Our results surprisingly indicate that it requires less

  charges on their endpoints","In this note we describe hadrons: mesons and baryons as strings with electric
charges on their endpoints. We consider here only the neutral system with
opposite charges coupled to an external constant electric and magnetic fields.
We derive certain classical solutions including rotating folded open strings.
We write down the mode expansion and canonically quantize the system. The OPEs
associated with such strings are determined. We re-derive the non-commutativity
of the zero modes and the fact that the charges modify the spacetime metric. We
show that the quantum worldsheet energy momentum tensor on the boundary is
affected by the endpoint charges and differs from the corresponding Noether
current. We determine the generalization of the Veneziano scattering amplitude
for such strings in the critical dimension. Phenomenological implications are
addressed and in particular we show that the external magnetic field can be
tuned so that the amplitude vanishes for particular kinematic setups. We
discuss the generalization of such strings to non-critical four dimensional
spacetime. In particular we renormalize the divergence of the
Polchinski-Strominger effective action associated with the rotating folded
string.

third most commonly diagnosed cancer in males and the second in females. For
colorectal cancer, the best screening test available is the colonoscopy. During
a colonoscopic procedure, a tiny camera at the tip of the endoscope generates a
video of the internal mucosa of the colon. The video data are displayed on a
monitor for the physician to examine the lining of the entire colon and check
for colorectal polyps. Detection and removal of colorectal polyps are
associated with a reduction in mortality from colorectal cancer. However, the
miss rate of polyp detection during colonoscopy procedure is often high even
for very experienced physicians. The reason lies in the high variation of polyp
in terms of shape, size, textural, color and illumination. Though challenging,
with the great advances in object detection techniques, automated polyp
detection still demonstrates a great potential in reducing the false negative
rate while maintaining a high precision. In this paper, we propose a novel
anchor free polyp detector that can localize polyps without using predefined
anchor boxes. To further strengthen the model, we leverage a Context
Enhancement Module and Cosine Ground truth Projection. Our approach can respond
in real time while achieving state-of-the-art performance with 99.36% precision
and 96.44% recall.

(3D) topological materials with 13 representative samples selected from each
class, including 1D trans-polyacetylene, two-dimensional (2D) graphene, and 3D
topological insulators, Dirac semimetals, Weyl semimetals, and nodal-line
semimetals. This review is not intended to present a complete up-to-date list
of publications on topological materials, nor to provide a progress report on
the theoretical concepts and experimental advances, but rather to focus on an
analysis based on the valence-bond model to help the readers gain a more
balanced view of the real-space bonding electron characteristics at the
molecular level versus the reciprocal-space band picture of topological
materials. Starting from a brief review of low-dimensional magnetism with `toy
models' for a 1D Heisenberg antiferromagnetic (HAF) chain, 1D
trans-polyacetylene and 2D graphene are found to have similar conjugated
(\pi)-bond systems, and the Dirac cone is correlated to their unconventional 1D
and 2D conduction mechanisms. Strain-driven and symmetry-protected topological
insulators are introduced from the perspective of material preparation and
valence-electron sharing in the valence-bond model analysis. The valence-bond
models for the newly developed Dirac semimetals, Weyl semimetals, and nodal
line semimetals are examined with more emphasis on the bond length and electron
sharing, which is found consistent with the band picture.

  formation of laser induced periodic surface structures in metals","The formation of self-organized laser induced periodic surface structures
(LIPSS) in metals, semiconductors and dielectrics upon pulsed laser irradiation
is a well-known phenomenon, receiving increased attention due to its huge
technological potential. For the case of metals, a major role in this process
is played by surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs) propagating at the interface of
the metal with the medium of incidence. Yet, simple and advanced models based
on SPP propagation sometimes fail to explain experimental results, even of
basic features as the LIPSS period. We experimentally demonstrate, for the
particular case of LIPSS on Cu, that significant deviations of the structure
period from the predictions of the standard model are observed, which are very
pronounced for elevated angles of laser incidence. In order to explain this
deviation, we introduce a model based on the propagation of a SPP on a rough
surface that takes into account the influence of the specific roughness
properties on the SPP wave vector. Good agreement of the modelling results with
the experimental data is observed, which highlights the potential of this model
for the general understanding of LIPSS in other metals.

  dark energy","We study infrared effects in perturbation theory for large-scale structure
coupled to the effective field theory of dark energy, focusing on, in
particular, Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor (DHOST) theories. In the
subhorizon, Newtonian limit, DHOST theories introduce an extra large-scale
velocity $v^i_\pi$ which is in general different from the matter velocity
$v^i$. Contrary to the case in Horndeski theories, the presence of this extra
large-scale velocity means that one cannot eliminate the long-wavelength
effects of both $v^i$ and $v^i_\pi$ with a single coordinate transformation,
and thus the standard $\Lambda$CDM consistency relations for large-scale
structure are violated by terms proportional to the relative velocity $v^i -
v^i_\pi$. We show, however, that in non-linear quantities this violation is
determined by the linear equations and the symmetries of the fluid system. We
find that the size of the baryon acoustic oscillations in the squeezed limit of
the bispectrum is modified, that the bias expansion contains extra terms which
contribute to the squeezed limit of the galaxy bispectrum, that infrared modes
in the one-loop power spectrum no longer cancel, and that the equal-time double
soft limit of the tree-level trispectrum is non-vanishing. In addition, we give
explicit expressions for how these violations depend on the relative velocity.
Many of our computations are also relevant for perturbation theory in
$\Lambda$CDM with exact time dependence.

4304 extended radio galaxies from Radio Galaxy Zoo. A total of 87% of the
sample lies within a projected 15 Mpc of an optically identified cluster.
Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are more likely than other cluster members to
be radio sources, and are also moderately bent. The surface density as a
function of separation from cluster center of non-BCG radio galaxies follows a
power law with index $-1.10\pm 0.03$ out to $10~r_{500}$ ($\sim 7~$Mpc), which
is steeper than the corresponding distribution for optically selected galaxies.
Non-BCG radio galaxies are statistically more bent the closer they are to the
cluster center. Within the inner $1.5~r_{500}$ ($\sim 1~$Mpc) of a cluster,
non-BCG radio galaxies are statistically more bent in high-mass clusters than
in low-mass clusters. Together, we find that non-BCG sources are statistically
more bent in environments that exert greater ram pressure. We use the
orientation of bent radio galaxies as an indicator of galaxy orbits and find
that they are preferentially in radial orbits. Away from clusters, there is a
large population of bent radio galaxies, limiting their use as cluster
locators; however, they are still located within statistically overdense
regions. We investigate the asymmetry in the tail length of sources that have
their tails aligned along the radius vector from the cluster center, and find
that the length of the inward-pointing tail is weakly suppressed for sources
close to the center of the cluster.

field theories by performing calculations in their gravitational duals. We
compute entanglement entropy in a variety of holographic systems, paying
particular attention to its long-distance behaviour, characterised by a term
proportional to surface area. This term is known to decrease along
Lorentz-invariant renormalisation group flows, suggesting that it may count
massless degrees of freedom. We find that more general deformations may
increase this area term, possibly indicating an enhanced number of
long-distance degrees of freedom. We observe a correlation between this
enhancement and the emergence of new scaling symmetry at long distances. Next,
we study the spectrum of collective excitations in a holographic model of a
non-Fermi liquid. At high temperatures, the spectrum of collective excitations
includes hydrodynamic sound waves. As in similar models, we observe that
sound-like modes also exist at low temperatures. Such modes are known as
holographic zero sound. We study the changing properties of holographic zero
sound and the emergence of hydrodynamic behaviour at high temperatures as we
vary the parameters of the model. We find that for certain values of the
parameters, the temperature-dependence of holographic zero sound qualitatively
resembles that of a normal Fermi liquid. Finally, we study the entanglement
entropy contribution of surface defects in a six-dimensional quantum field
theory of relevance to M-theory, which is a candidate theory of quantum
gravity. We find that the entanglement entropy does not montonically decrease
along renormalisation group flows on these defects, ruling it out as a
potential measure of degrees of freedom. On the other hand, we find that two of
the contributions of the defect to the Weyl anomaly of the quantum field theory
decrease along all of the flows that we study.

over fluctuating two-ray (FTR) channels, which is used to model the millimetre
wave channel, is investigated in terms of the secrecy outage probability (SOP).
Specifically, we consider the case where a source (S) transmits confidential
messages to a destination (D), and an eavesdropper wants to wiretap the
information from S to D. In a CRN framework, we assume that the primary user
shares its spectrum with S, where S adopts the underlay strategy to control its
transmit power without impairing the quality of service of the primary user.
After some mathematical manipulations, an exact analytical expression for the
SOP is derived. In order to get physical and technical insights into the effect
of the channel parameters on the SOP, we derive an asymptotic formula for the
SOP in the high signal-to-noise ratio region of the S--D link. We finally show
some selected Monte-Carlo simulation results to validate the correctness of our
derived analytical expressions.

models of computation studied in automata theory. Their conceptual extension is
the non-deterministic finite automata which also have plenty of applications.
In this article, we study these models through the lens of succinct data
structures where our ultimate goal is to encode these mathematical objects
using information-theoretically optimal number of bits along with supporting
queries on them efficiently. Towards this goal, we first design a succinct data
structure for representing any deterministic finite automaton $\mathcal{D}$
having $n$ states over a $\sigma$-letter alphabet $\Sigma$ using $(\sigma-1)
n\log n + O(n \log \sigma)$ bits of space, which can determine, given an input
string $x$ over $\Sigma$, whether $\mathcal{D}$ accepts $x$ in $O(|x| \log
\sigma)$ time, using constant words of working space. When the input
deterministic finite automaton is acyclic, not only we can improve the above
space-bound significantly to $(\sigma -1) (n-1)\log n+ 3n + O(\log^2 \sigma) +
o(n)$ bits, we also obtain optimal query time for string acceptance checking.
More specifically, using our succinct representation, we can check if a given
input string $x$ can be accepted by the acyclic deterministic finite automaton
using time proportional to the length of $x$, hence, the optimal query time. We
also exhibit a succinct data structure for representing a non-deterministic
finite automaton $\mathcal{N}$ having $n$ states over a $\sigma$-letter
alphabet $\Sigma$ using $\sigma n^2+n$ bits of space, such that given an input
string $x$, we can decide whether $\mathcal{N}$ accepts $x$ efficiently in
$O(n^2|x|)$ time. Finally, we also provide time and space-efficient algorithms
for performing several standard operations such as union, intersection, and
complement on the languages accepted by deterministic finite automata.

exists a localization transition with renormalized disorder that depends
logarithmically on the finite size of the system. The transition observed for
$\alpha>2$ does not need a rescaling in disorder strength. Most importantly, we
find that even though the MBL transition for $\alpha >2$ falls in the same
universality class as that of the short-range models, while transition for
$\alpha<2$ belongs to a different universality class. {Due to the intrinsic
nature of the RSRG flow towards delocalization, MBL phase for $\alpha>2$ might
suffer an instability in the thermodynamic limit while the underlying systems
support algebraic localization. Moreover, we verify these findings by inserting
microscopic details to the RSRG scheme where we additionally find a more
appropriate rescaling function for disorder strength; we indeed uncover a power
law scaling with a logarithmic correction and a distinctly different stretched
exponential scaling for $\alpha<2$ and $\alpha>2$, respectively, by analyzing
system with finite size. This finding further suggests that microscopic RSRG
scheme is able to give a hint of instability of the MBL phase for $\alpha>2$

respectively). Our work is motivated by recent, high redshift studies that
measure molecular gas masses (\ensuremath{\rm{M}_{\rm{mol}}}) via a calibration
of the rest-frame $850\mu$m luminosity ($L_\mathrm{850\mu m,rest}$) against the
CO(1-0)-derived \ensuremath{\rm{M}_{\rm{mol}}}\ of star-forming galaxies. We
hereby test whether this method is valid for the types of high-redshift,
star-forming galaxies to which it has been applied. We recover a clear
correlation between the rest-frame $850\mu$m luminosity, inferred from the
single-band, long-wavelength flux, and the CO(1-0) line luminosity, consistent
with the samples used to perform the $850\mu$m calibration. The molecular gas
masses, derived from $L_\mathrm{850\mu m,rest}$, agree to within a factor of
two with those derived from CO(1-0). We show that this factor of two
uncertainty can arise from the values of the dust emissivity index and
temperature that need to be assumed in order to extrapolate from the observed
frequency to the rest-frame at 850$\mathrm{\mu m}$. The extrapolation to
850$\mathrm{\mu m}$ therefore has a smaller effect on the accuracy of \Mmol\
derived via single-band dust-continuum observations than the assumed
CO(1-0)-to-\ensuremath{\rm{M}_{\rm{mol}}}\ conversion factor. We therefore
conclude that single-band observations of long-wavelength dust emission can be
used to reliably constrain the molecular gas masses of massive, star-forming
galaxies at $z\gtrsim2$.

complexity of the readout of a camera) and their sensitivity to unwanted
wavelengths. This explains why photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are still selected
for the largest cameras of present and future Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray
telescopes. These telescopes require photosensors that are sensitive to the
fast and dim optical/near-UV Cherenkov radiation emitted due to the interaction
of gamma rays with the atmosphere. Here we introduce a low-cost pixel
consisting of a SiPM attached to a PMMA disk doped with a wavelength-shifting
material, which collects light over a much larger area than standard SiPMs,
increases sensitivity to near-UV light and improves background rejection. We
also show the measurements performed in the laboratory with a proof-of-concept
\textit{Light-Trap} pixel that is equipped with a 3$\times$3~mm$^2$ SiPM
collecting light only in the 300-400~nm band, covering an area $\sim$20 times
larger than that of the same SiPM itself. We also present results from
simulations performed with Geant4 to evaluate its performance. In addition to
VHE astronomy, this pixel could have other applications in fields where
detection area and cost are critical.

  Images in the Wild","We propose a method to learn 3D deformable object categories from raw
single-view images, without external supervision. The method is based on an
autoencoder that factors each input image into depth, albedo, viewpoint and
illumination. In order to disentangle these components without supervision, we
use the fact that many object categories have, at least in principle, a
symmetric structure. We show that reasoning about illumination allows us to
exploit the underlying object symmetry even if the appearance is not symmetric
due to shading. Furthermore, we model objects that are probably, but not
certainly, symmetric by predicting a symmetry probability map, learned
end-to-end with the other components of the model. Our experiments show that
this method can recover very accurately the 3D shape of human faces, cat faces
and cars from single-view images, without any supervision or a prior shape
model. On benchmarks, we demonstrate superior accuracy compared to another
method that uses supervision at the level of 2D image correspondences.

of light-matter interaction, and is central to various quantum technologies.
Recently, new regimes beyond the weak and strong light-matter coupling have
been explored in several settings. These regimes, where the interaction
strength is comparable (ultrastrong) or even higher (deep-strong) than the
transition frequencies in the system, can give rise to new physical effects and
applications. At the same time, they challenge our understanding of cavity QED.
When the interaction strength is so high, fundamental issues like the proper
definition of subsystems and of their quantum measurements, the structure of
light-matter ground states, or the analysis of time-dependent interactions are
subject to ambiguities leading to even qualitatively distinct predictions. The
resolution of these ambiguities is also important for understanding and
designing next-generation quantum devices that will exploit the ultrastrong

entities through financial asset freezing, embargoes, and travel restrictions.
The relationships between the issuer and the targeted entities in such lists

pave the way toward understanding the foreign political power structure that
influences institutions to take similar actions. In the current paper, by
analyzing the smart sanctions lists issued by major countries and international
institutions worldwide (a total of 73 countries, 12 international
organizations, and 1,700 lists), we identify the hierarchical structure of
influence among these institutions that encourages them to take such actions.
The Helmholtz--Hodge decomposition is a method that decomposes network flow
into a hierarchical gradient component and a loop component and is especially

leveraging emotional signals, the existing methods focus on exploiting the
emotions of news contents that conveyed by the publishers (i.e., publisher

there exists a relationship between publisher emotion and social emotion (i.e.,
dual emotion), and how the dual emotion appears in fake news. In this paper, we
verify that dual emotion is distinctive between fake and real news and propose
Dual Emotion Features to represent dual emotion and the relationship between
them for fake news detection. Further, we exhibit that our proposed features

inward magnetic pressure gradient induces retrograde mass accretion in the wake
of the primary shock front. Subsequently, we find that the primary shockwave
expands faster perpendicular to the field, but with reduced momentum, while the
remnant core is subject to magnetic confinement. This leads to a decrease in
fractional volume of hot gas but also an increase in the density and
temperature of hot gas in the magnetically confined remnant. The magnetic
pressure gradient behind the shock front generates enhanced regions favourable
to UV- heating and thus reduces net radiative losses. Although the presence of
a strong uniform magnetic field can reduce momentum early on, and hence
residual kinetic energy, it increases the efficiency of residual total energy
injection by the SN into the ISM by up to 40% within 1 Myr.

the bulk and 1D helical edge states in its monolayer. These features have
recently attracted wide attention in condensed matter physics. However, in the
intermediate regime between the bulk and monolayer, the edge states have not
been resolved owing to its closed band gap which makes the bulk states
dominant. Here, we report the signatures of the edge superconductivity by
superconducting quantum interference measurements in multilayer WTe2 Josephson
junctions and we directly map the localized supercurrent. In thick WTe2 (~60
nm), the supercurrent is uniformly distributed by bulk states with symmetric
Josephson effect ($\left|I_c^+(B)\right|=\left|I_c^-(B)\right|$). In thin WTe2
(10 nm), however, the supercurrent becomes confined to the edge and its width
reaches up to 1.4 um and exhibits non-symmetric behavior
$\left|I_c^+(B)\right|\neq \left|I_c^-(B)\right|$. The ability to tune the edge
domination by changing thickness and the edge superconductivity establishes
WTe2 as a promising topological system with exotic quantum phases and a rich

  Wikipedia Tables","Wikipedia tables represent an important resource, where information is
organized w.r.t table schemas consisting of columns. In turn each column, may
contain instance values that point to other Wikipedia articles or primitive
values (e.g. numbers, strings etc.).
  In this work, we focus on the problem of interlinking Wikipedia tables for
two types of table relations: equivalent and subPartOf. Through such relations,
we can further harness semantically related information by accessing related
tables or facts therein. Determining the relation type of a table pair is not
trivial, as it is dependent on the schemas, the values therein, and the
semantic overlap of the cell values in the corresponding tables.
  We propose TableNet, an approach that constructs a knowledge graph of
interlinked tables with subPartOf and equivalent relations. TableNet consists
of two main steps: (i) for any source table we provide an efficient algorithm
to find all candidate related tables with high coverage, and (ii) a neural
based approach, which takes into account the table schemas, and the
corresponding table data, we determine with high accuracy the table relation
for a table pair.
  We perform an extensive experimental evaluation on the entire Wikipedia with
more than 3.2 million tables. We show that with more than 88\% we retain
relevant candidate tables pairs for alignment. Consequentially, with an
accuracy of 90% we are able to align tables with subPartOf or equivalent
relations. Comparisons with existing competitors show that TableNet has
superior performance in terms of coverage and alignment accuracy.

lens of Shannon's rate-distortion theory, where the goal is to achieve the
lowest possible distortion (e.g., low MSE or high SSIM) at any given bit rate.
However, in recent years, it has become increasingly accepted that ""low
distortion"" is not a synonym for ""high perceptual quality"", and in fact
optimization of one often comes at the expense of the other. In light of this
understanding, it is natural to seek for a generalization of rate-distortion
theory which takes perceptual quality into account. In this paper, we adopt the
mathematical definition of perceptual quality recently proposed by Blau &
Michaeli (2018), and use it to study the three-way tradeoff between rate,
distortion, and perception. We show that restricting the perceptual quality to
be high, generally leads to an elevation of the rate-distortion curve, thus
necessitating a sacrifice in either rate or distortion. We prove several
fundamental properties of this triple-tradeoff, calculate it in closed form for
a Bernoulli source, and illustrate it visually on a toy MNIST example.

  Non-Hermitian Random Matrices","Complex networks with directed, local interactions are ubiquitous in nature,
and often occur with probabilistic connections due to both intrinsic
stochasticity and disordered environments. Sparse non-Hermitian random matrices
arise naturally in this context, and are key to describing statistical
properties of the non-equilibrium dynamics that emerges from interactions
within the network structure. Here, we study one-dimensional (1d) spatial
structures and focus on sparse non-Hermitian random matrices in the spirit of
tight-binding models in solid state physics. We first investigate two-point
eigenvalue correlations in the complex plane for sparse non-Hermitian random
matrices using methods developed for the statistical mechanics of inhomogeneous
2d interacting particles. We find that eigenvalue repulsion in the complex
plane directly correlates with eigenvector delocalization. In addition, for 1d
chains and rings with both disordered nearest neighbor connections and
self-interactions, the self-interaction disorder tends to de-correlate
eigenvalues and localize eigenvectors more than simple hopping disorder.
However, remarkable resistance to eigenvector localization by disorder is
provided by large cycles, such as those embodied in 1d periodic boundary
conditions under strong directional bias. The directional bias also spatially
separates the left and right eigenvectors, leading to interesting dynamics in
excitation and response. These phenomena have important implications for
asymmetric random networks and highlight a need for mathematical tools to
describe and understand them analytically.

Compared with state-of-the-art methods, extensive experimental results in terms

can project speech segments into a latent code space where the distribution is
a simple diagonal Gaussian. Our preliminary investigation on the TIMIT database
shows that this code space exhibits favorable properties such as denseness and
pseudo linearity, and perceptually important factors such as phonetic content
and speaker trait can be represented as particular directions within the code
space.

prefers high-frequency tokens, which results in low-diversity responses. We
then propose a Frequency-Aware Cross-Entropy (FACE) loss function that improves
over the CE loss function by incorporating a weighting mechanism conditioned on

integrating segment- and snippet score-based methodologies to produce proposals

hybrid strategy, we focus on the potential of the snippet score-based approach.
Specifically, we propose a new snippet score-based method, named Snippet
Relatedness-based Generator (SRG), with a novel concept of ""snippet
relatedness"". Snippet relatedness represents which snippets are related to a
specific action instance. To effectively learn this snippet relatedness, we
present ""pyramid non-local operations"" for locally and globally capturing
long-range dependencies among snippets. By employing these components, SRG
first produces a 2D relatedness score map that enables the generation of
various temporal intervals reliably covering most action instances with high
overlap. Then, SRG evaluates the action confidence scores of these temporal
intervals and refines their boundaries to obtain temporal action proposals. On
THUMOS-14 and ActivityNet-1.3 datasets, SRG outperforms state-of-the-art
methods for temporal action proposal generation. Furthermore, compared to
competing proposal generators, SRG leads to significant improvements in

introducing weak interactions, we find that an anomalous noninteracting
dynamical exponent becomes diffusive for any potential strength. This is borne
out by a boundary-driven Lindblad dynamics as well as unitary dynamics, with
agreeing diffusion constants. This must be contrasted to random potential where
transport is subdiffusive at such small interactions. Mean-field treatment of
the dynamics for small U always slows down the non-interacting dynamics to
subdiffusion, and is therefore unable to describe diffusion in an interacting
quasiperiodic system. Finally, briefly exploring larger interactions we find a
regime of interaction-induced subdiffusive dynamics, despite the on-site

  and weak-lensing mass bias","Weak-lensing measurements of the masses of galaxy clusters are commonly based
on the assumption of spherically symmetric density profiles. Yet, the cold dark
matter model predicts the shapes of dark matter halos to be triaxial. Halo
triaxiality, and the orientation of the major axis with respect to the line of
sight, are expected to be the leading cause of intrinsic scatter in
weak-lensing mass measurements. The shape of central cluster galaxies
(Brightest Cluster Galaxies; BCGs) is expected to follow the shape of the dark
matter halo. Here we investigate the use of BCG ellipticity as predictor of the
weak-lensing mass bias in individual clusters compared to the mean. Using weak
lensing masses $M^{\rm WL}_{500}$ from the Weighing the Giants project, and
$M_{500}$ derived from gas masses as low-scatter mass proxy, we find that, on
average, the lensing masses of clusters with the roundest / most elliptical 25%
of BCGs are biased $\sim 20$% high / low compared to the average, as
qualitatively predicted by the cold dark matter model. For cluster cosmology
projects utilizing weak-lensing mass estimates, the shape of the BCG can thus
contribute useful information on the effect of orientation bias in weak lensing
mass estimates as well as on cluster selection bias.

quasars originates from the obscuration of the quasar core by dusty clouds
moving in the torus, high linear optical polarization would be expected in
those objects. We then measured the rest-frame UV-blue linear polarization of a
sample of 13 changing-look quasars, 7 of them being in a type 1.9-2 state. For
all quasars but one the polarization degree is lower than 1%. This suggests
that the disappearance of the broad emission lines cannot be attributed to dust
obscuration, and supports the scenario in which changes of look are caused by a
change in the rate of accretion onto the supermassive black hole. Such low
polarization degrees also indicate that these quasars are seen under
inclinations close to the system axis. One type 1.9-2 quasar in our sample
shows a high polarization degree of 6.8%. While this polarization could be
ascribed to obscuration by a moving dusty cloud, we argue that this is unlikely
given the very long time needed for a cloud from the torus to eclipse the broad
emission line region of that object. We propose that the high polarization is
due to the echo of a past bright phase seen in polar-scattered light. This
interpretation raises the possibility that broad emission lines observed in the
polarized light of some type 2 active galactic nuclei can be echoes of past
type 1 phases and not evidence of hidden broad emission line regions.

headers compact, BLS signatures are used to combine signatures. We provide a
definition of SCPs and show the required steps of a client to create a proof

light-client-only blockchain is the lower storage requirement, while the
drawback is an increased computational complexity due to BLS signatures,
limited use-cases due to lack of a global state, and the requirement for an
interactive protocol between sender, receiver, and miner to create a

radius of the nucleus $^{16}$O to identify the most influential low-energy
constants in the next-to-next-to-leading order chiral Hamiltonian with two- and
three-nucleon forces. For this purpose we develop a subspace-projected
coupled-cluster method using eigenvector continuation [Frame D. et al., Phys.
Rev. Lett. 121, 032501 (2018)]. With this method we compute the binding energy
and charge radius of $^{16}$O at more than one million different values of the
16 low-energy constants in one hour on a standard laptop. For relatively small
subspace projections, the root-mean-square error is about 1% compared to full
space coupled-cluster results. We find that 58(1)% of the variance in the
energy can be apportioned to a single contact-term in the $^3S_1$-wave, whereas
the radius depends sensitively on several low-energy constants and their
higher-order correlations. The results identify the most important parameters
for describing nuclear saturation, and help prioritize efforts for uncertainty
reduction of theoretical predictions. The achieved acceleration opens up for an
array of computational statistics analyses of the underlying description of the

upper bounded by $k$ while the other one can be generated by two kinds of the
special entangled states of type $k$. This method is very effective for those
$k=p^m\geq 3$ where $p$ is a prime number. For these cases, we can otain sets

large. Moreover, one can find that our method here can be easily extended when
there are more than two kinds of the special entangled states of type $k$ at
hand.

terrestrial bodies with silicate sand as the main sediment composition.
However, it has not been thoroughly studied for icy bodies such as Titan with
organic sand as the main dune-forming material. We used the colloidal probe
atomic force microscopy (AFM) technique to study triboelectric charging
processes using Titan and Earth sand analogs. We found that it is easy to
generate triboelectric charges between naphthalene (a simple aromatic
hydrocarbon), polystyrene (an aromatic hydrocarbon polymer), and borosilicate
glass (Earth silicate sand analog). Strong electrostatic forces can be measured
after contact and/or tribocharging. In contrast, tholin, a complex organic
material, does not generate any detectable electrostatic forces with contact or
tribocharging within the detection limit of the instrument. If Titan sand
behaves more like tholin, this indicates that the tribocharging capacity of
Titan sand is much weaker than Earth silicate sand and much less than
previously measured by Mendez-Harper et al., (2017), where only simple organics
were used for Titan sand analogs. Thus, triboelectrification may not contribute
to increasing interparticle forces between sand particles on Titan as much as
on Earth. Interparticle forces generated by other electrostatic processes or
other interparticle forces such as van der Waals and capillary cohesion forces
could be the dominant interparticle forces that govern Titan sand formation and
sediment transportation on the surface. Titan sand is also unlikely to produce
large electrical discharge through tribocharging to affect future missions to
Titan's surface.

  Post-Inflation Scenario","Many works have concentrated on the observable signatures of the dark matter
being an ultralight axion-like particle (ALP). We concentrate on a particularly
dramatic signature in the late-time cosmological matter power spectrum that
occurs if the symmetry breaking that establishes the ALP happens after
inflation -- white-noise density fluctuations that dominate at small scales
over the adiabatic fluctuations from inflation. These fluctuations alter the
early history of nonlinear structure formation. We find that for symmetry
breaking scales of $f_A \sim 10^{13}-10^{15}$GeV, which requires a high
effective maximum temperature after inflation, ALP dark matter with particle
mass of $m_A \sim 10^{-13}-10^{-20}$eV could significantly change the number of
high-redshift dwarf galaxies, the reionization history, and the Ly$\alpha$
forest. We consider all three observables. We find that the Ly$\alpha$ forest
is the most constraining of current observables, excluding $f_A \gtrsim
10^{15}$GeV ($m_A \lesssim 10^{-17}$eV) in the simplest model for the ALP and
considerably lower values in models coupled to a hidden strongly interacting
sector ($f_A \gtrsim 10^{13}$GeV and $m_A \lesssim 10^{-13}$eV). Observations
that constrain the extremely high-redshift tail of reionization may disfavor
similar levels of isocurvature fluctuations as the forest. Future $z\sim 20-30$

preferred outcomes. The framework also enables discovery of most influential

coupled to another, the ""probe"", in a compact spacetime region. Measurements of
observables in the probe system then serve as proxy measurements of observables
in the system, under a correspondence which depends also on a preparation state
of the probe theory. All our constructions are local and covariant, and the
conditions may be stated abstractly in the framework of algebraic quantum field
theory (AQFT). The induced system observables corresponding to probe
observables may be localized in the causal hull of the coupling region and are
typically less sharp than the probe observable, but more sharp than the actual
measurement on the coupled theory. A formula is given for the post-selected
system state, conditioned on measurement outcomes, which is closely related to
the notion of an instrument as introduced by Davies and Lewis. This formula has
the important property that individual measurements form consistent composites,
provided that their coupling regions can be causally ordered and a certain
causal factorisation property holds for the dynamics; the composite is
independent of the causal order chosen if more than one exists. The general
framework is amenable to calculation, as is shown in a specific example. This

investigated according to the possible orientations of zigzag/armchair

mechanism of influence of Stone-Wales defects on antimonene nanotubes. When the
structure of antimonene changes from monolayer to tube, the indirect gap
semiconductor antimonene transforms to a direct gap one. Moreover, the
character of direct band gap for the antimonene nanotube is preserved with the
Stone-Wales defect forming, while the energy of conduction band bottoms change
due to the intervene of the defect energy level in the band gaps. These results
may provide valuable references to the development and design of novel

thermal inversions (or 'stratospheres') in their atmospheres with important
implications for their atmospheric processes. Canonically, thermal inversions
in hot Jupiters have been suggested to be caused by species such as TiO and VO
which have strong visible opacity to absorb incident starlight. We explore two
new avenues for thermal inversions in hot Jupiters, exploring both the visible
and infrared opacities in their atmospheres. Firstly, by exploring a range of
metal-rich species we find that four species (AlO, CaO, NaH and MgH) provide
visible opacities comparable to TiO/VO and can cause strong inversions with
reasonable abundances. Secondly, we show that a low infrared opacity caused by
a low H$_2$O abundance, e.g. through a C/O~1, can also lead to strong thermal
inversions even with low abundances of the visible absorbers mentioned above.
We find that increasing the C/O ratio towards unity requires almost 2 orders of
magnitude lower abundances for the visible absorbers in order for an inversion
to form. Finally, we explore the thermal inversion in WASP-121b and find that
it can be explained by all the visible absorbers listed above for different C/O
ratios. Our study demonstrates the importance of both the refractory and
volatile species in governing the physicochemical processes in hot Jupiter
atmospheres. Spectroscopic observations in the visible have the potential to
detect the newly proposed refractory species that can cause thermal inversions
in addition to TiO and VO.

the tenets of Radon--Nikodym approach $\langle f(\mathbf{x})\psi^2 \rangle /

input attributes, all the answers are obtained from a generalized eigenproblem

interpolation problem is a regular Radon-Nikodym derivative. The solution to
the classification problem requires prior and posterior probabilities that are
obtained using the Lebesgue quadrature[1] technique. Whereas in a Bayesian
approach new observations change only outcome probabilities, in the
Radon-Nikodym approach not only outcome probabilities but also the probability
space $|\psi^{[i]}\rangle$ change with new observations. This is a remarkable
feature of the approach: both the probabilities and the probability space are
constructed from the data. The Lebesgue quadrature technique can be also
applied to the optimal clustering problem. The problem is solved by
constructing a Gaussian quadrature on the Lebesgue measure. A distinguishing
feature of the Radon-Nikodym approach is the knowledge of the invariant group:
all the answers are invariant relatively any non-degenerated linear transform

large uncertainties because of persisting backgrounds and uncertainties. New
projects using leptons rather than hadrons should be investigated Ho has a spin
zero and its coupling is proportional to the square of the lepton mass, greatly
enhancing the production from pairs of muons. A mu+mu- Collider may operate at
a much higher magnetic field respect to the e+e- Collider and it has a smaller
radius, easily fitting within one existing European site. However muons are
unstable particles: they must be produced in sufficient amounts from pions of a
proton beam, cooled and quickly accelerated to the required energies. The
scenario is here primarily concentrated to further developments of the European

  Method (DR-EAM)","In simulations of metallic interfaces, a critical aspect of metallic behavior
is missing from the some of the most widely used classical molecular dynamics
force fields. We present a modification of the embedded atom method (EAM) which
allows for electronic polarization of the metal by treating the valence density
around each atom as a fluctuating dynamical quantity. The densities are
represented by a set of additional fluctuating variables (and their conjugate
momenta) which are propagated along with the nuclear coordinates. This
``density readjusting EAM'' (DR-EAM) preserves nearly all of the useful
qualities of traditional EAM, including bulk elastic properties and surface
energies. However, it also allows valence electron density to migrate through
the metal in response to external perturbations. We show that DR-EAM can
successfully model polarization in response to external charges, capturing the
image charge effect in atomistic simulations. DR-EAM also captures some of the
behavior of metals in the presence of uniform electric fields, predicting
surface charging and shielding internal to the metal. We further show that it
predicts charge transfer between the constituent atoms in alloys, leading to
novel predictions about unit cell geometries in layered L$1_0$ structures.

between large-scale fluctuations in the observed number density of tracers,
$\delta_\mathrm{h}$, and the underlying matter density, $\delta$. Bias models
often express $\delta_\mathrm{h}$ as a truncated series of integro-differential
operators acting on $\delta$, each weighted by a bias parameter. Due to the
presence of `composite operators' (obtained by multiplying fields evaluated at
the same spatial location), the linear bias parameter measured from clustering
statistics does not coincide with that appearing in the bias expansion. This
issue can be cured by re-writing the expansion in terms of `renormalised'
operators. After providing a pedagogical and comprehensive review of bias
renormalisation in perturbation theory, we generalize the concept to
non-perturbative dynamics and successfully apply it to dark-matter haloes
extracted from a large suite of N-body simulations. When comparing numerical
and perturbative results, we highlight the effect of the window function
employed to smooth the random fields. We then measure the bias parameters as a
function of halo mass by fitting a non-perturbative bias model (both before and
after applying renormalisation) to the cross spectrum
$P_{\delta_\mathrm{h}\delta}(k)$. Finally, we employ Bayesian model selection
to determine the optimal operator set to describe
$P_{\delta_\mathrm{h}\delta}(k)$ for $k<0.2\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$ at redshift $z=0$.
We find that it includes $\delta, \nabla^2\delta, \delta^2$ and the square of
the traceless tidal tensor, $s^2$. Considering higher-order terms (in $\delta$)
leads to overfitting as they cannot be precisely constrained by our data. We
also notice that next-to-leading-order perturbative solutions are inaccurate
for $k\gtrsim 0.1\,h$ Mpc$^{-1}$.

from VLA observation as a tracer of the gravitational potential. The
introduction of the cold gas kinematics shows a significant effect on the
confidence limits of especially the dark halo properties: we exclude more than
$95\%$ of models within the $1-\sigma$ confidence level of Schwarzschild
modelling with only stellar kinematics, and reduce the relative uncertainty of
the dark matter fraction significantly to $10\%$ within $5 R_\mathrm{e}$.

inner slope of $0.6^{+0.2}_{-0.3}$ when including the cold gas kinematics in
our model. We cannot constrain the inner slope with the stellar kinematics
alone.

We express the trajectory as a piecewise Bernstein polynomial and formulate the

ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) traffic with strict
requirements on latency and reliability. The URLLC traffic, which is usually
analyzed by a metric called the age of information (AoI), is assigned the first

independent of all the parameters of the problem, and that they are within

in strongly correlated two dimensional fermionic superconductors and Fermi
gases. We arrive at the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature
$T_{\text{BKT}}$ as a function of \emph{attractive} pairing strength by
associating it with the onset of ""quasi-condensation"" in the normal phase. Our
approach builds on a criterion for determining the BKT transition temperature
for atomic gases which is based on a well established Quantum Monte Carlo
analysis of the phase space density. This latter quantity, when derived from
BCS-BEC crossover theory for fermions, leads to non-monotonic behavior for
$T_{\text{BKT}}$ as a function of the attractive interaction or inverse
scattering length. In Fermi gases, this implies a robust superconducting dome
followed by a long tail from the flat BEC asymptote, rather similar to what is
observed experimentally. For lattice systems we find that $T_{\text{BKT}}$ has
an absolute maximum of the order of $0.1 E_F$. We discuss how our results
compare with those derived from the Nelson Kosterlitz criterion based on the
mean field superfluid density and the approach to the transition from below.
While there is agreement in the strict mean-field BCS regime at weak coupling,
we find that at moderate pairing strength bosonic excitations cause a
substantial increase in $T_\text{BKT}$ followed by an often dramatic decrease
before the system enters the BEC regime.

exploiting nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers are particularly compelling as they

with a wide bandwidth from zero to megahertz range. Full vector sensing
capability is proffered by modulating fields along the preferential NV axis and
in the transverse plane and subsequent demodulation of the signal. This sensor
exhibits a root mean square noise floor of about 300 pT/Hz^(1/2) in all

sensors and potentially also single-NV sensors, extending the vector capability
to nanoscale measurement under ambient temperatures.

Performing the linear stability analysis and the numerical simulation of the

synchronization of type I excitatory and inhibitory neurons, while feedback
loop motifs destroy their synchronization tendency. Moreover, large directed
networks, either without feedback motifs or with many of them, have been
constructed from the same undirected backbones, and a high synchronization
level is observed for directed acyclic graphs with type I neurons. It has been
shown that, the synchronizability of type I neurons depends on both the

(RNNs) are required to keep track of past events by creating memories. While
the relation between memories and the network's hidden state dynamics was
established over the last decade, previous works in this direction were of a
predominantly descriptive nature focusing mainly on locating the dynamical
objects of interest. In particular, it remained unclear how dynamical
observables affect the performance, how they form and whether they can be
manipulated. Here, we utilize different training protocols, datasets and
architectures to obtain a range of networks solving a delayed classification
task with similar performance, alongside substantial differences in their
ability to extrapolate for longer delays. We analyze the dynamics of the
network's hidden state, and uncover the reasons for this difference. Each
memory is found to be associated with a nearly steady state of the dynamics
which we refer to as a 'slow point'. Slow point speeds predict extrapolation
performance across all datasets, protocols and architectures tested.
Furthermore, by tracking the formation of the slow points we are able to
understand the origin of differences between training protocols. Finally, we
propose a novel regularization technique that is based on the relation between
hidden state speeds and memory longevity. Our technique manipulates these
speeds, thereby leading to a dramatic improvement in memory robustness over
time, and could pave the way for a new class of regularization methods.

  Inequality-Constrained Approach","A well-known challenge in beamforming is how to optimally utilize the degrees
of freedom (DoF) of the array to design a robust beamformer, especially when
the array DoF is smaller than the number of sources in the environment. In this
paper, we leverage the tool of constrained convex optimization and propose a
penalized inequality-constrained minimum variance (P-ICMV) beamformer to
address this challenge. Specifically, we propose a beamformer with a
well-targeted objective function and inequality constraints to achieve the
design goals. The constraints on interferences penalize the maximum gain of the
beamformer at any interfering directions. This can efficiently mitigate the
total interference power regardless of whether the number of interfering
sources is less than the array DoF or not. Multiple robust constraints on the
target protection and interference suppression can be introduced to increase
the robustness of the beamformer against steering vector mismatch. By
integrating the noise reduction, interference suppression, and target
protection, the proposed formulation can efficiently obtain a robust beamformer
design while optimally trade off various design goals. When the array DoF is
fewer than the number of interferences, the proposed formulation can
effectively align the limited DoF to all of the sources to obtain the best
overall interference suppression. $\ $To numerically solve this problem, we
formulate the P-ICMV beamformer design as a convex second-order cone program
(SOCP) and propose a low complexity iterative algorithm based on the
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Three applications are
simulated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed beamformer.

  Are Necessary","There exists a vast number of adversarial attacks and defences for machine
learning algorithms of various types which makes assessing the robustness of
algorithms a daunting task. To make matters worse, there is an intrinsic bias
in these adversarial algorithms. Here, we organise the problems faced: a) Model
Dependence, b) Insufficient Evaluation, c) False Adversarial Samples, and d)
Perturbation Dependent Results). Based on this, we propose a model agnostic
dual quality assessment method, together with the concept of robustness levels
to tackle them. We validate the dual quality assessment on state-of-the-art
neural networks (WideResNet, ResNet, AllConv, DenseNet, NIN, LeNet and CapsNet)
as well as adversarial defences for image classification problem. We further
show that current networks and defences are vulnerable at all levels of
robustness. The proposed robustness assessment reveals that depending on the
metric used (i.e., $L_0$ or $L_\infty$), the robustness may vary significantly.
Hence, the duality should be taken into account for a correct evaluation.
Moreover, a mathematical derivation, as well as a counter-example, suggest that
$L_1$ and $L_2$ metrics alone are not sufficient to avoid spurious adversarial
samples. Interestingly, the threshold attack of the proposed assessment is a
novel $L_\infty$ black-box adversarial method which requires even less
perturbation than the One-Pixel Attack (only $12\%$ of One-Pixel Attack's
amount of perturbation) to achieve similar results.

leverage multiple deep neural network (DNN) models for sub-tasks such as object
detection, hand tracking, and so on. Because of the diversity of the sub-tasks,
the layers within and across the DNN models are highly heterogeneous in
operation and shape. Such layer heterogeneity is a challenge for a fixed
dataflow accelerator (FDA) that employs a fixed dataflow on a single
accelerator substrate since each layer prefers different dataflows (computation
order and parallelization) and tile sizes. Reconfigurable DNN accelerators
(RDAs) have been proposed to adapt their dataflows to diverse layers to address
the challenge. However, the dataflow flexibility in RDAs is enabled at the area
and energy costs of expensive hardware structures (switches, controller, etc.)
and per-layer reconfiguration.
  Alternatively, this work proposes a new class of accelerators, heterogeneous
dataflow accelerators (HDAs), which deploys multiple sub-accelerators each
supporting a different dataflow. HDAs enable coarser-grained dataflow
flexibility than RDAs with higher energy efficiency and lower area cost
comparable to FDAs. To exploit such benefits, hardware resource partitioning
across sub-accelerators and layer execution schedule need to be carefully
optimized. Therefore, we also present Herald, which co-optimizes hardware
partitioning and layer execution schedule. Using Herald on a suite of AR/VR and
MLPerf workloads, we identify a promising HDA architecture, Maelstrom, which
demonstrates 65.3% lower latency and 5.0% lower energy than the best FDAs and
22.0% lower energy at the cost of 20.7% higher latency than a state-of-the-art
RDA. The results suggest that HDA is an alternative class of Pareto-optimal
accelerators to RDA with strength in energy, which can be a better choice than
RDAs depending on the use cases.

interferometers, this approach allows potentials to be measured by holding,

potential energy differences from as little as microns of vertical separation
generate megaradians of interferometer phase. This trapped geometry suppresses
the phase sensitivity to vibrations by 3-4 orders of magnitude, overcoming the

  Demands","Geo-social group search aims to find a group of people proximate to a
location while socially related. One of the driven applications for geo-social
group search is organizing an impromptu activity. This is because the social
cohesiveness of a found geo-social group ensures a good communication
atmosphere and the spatial closeness of the geo-social group reduces the
preparation time for the activity. Most existing works treat geo-social group
search as a problem that finds a group satisfying a single social constraint
while optimizing the spatial proximity. However, when an impromptu activity has
additional demands on attendees, e.g., the activity requires that the attendees
have certain set of skills, the existing works cannot find an effective
geo-social group efficiently. In this paper, we study how to find a group that
is most proximate to a query location while satisfying multiple constraints.
Specifically, the multiple constraints on which we focus include social
constraint, size constraint and keyword constraint. We propose a novel search
framework which first effectively narrows down the search space with
theoretical guarantees and then efficiently finds the optimum result. Although
our model considers multiple constraints, novel techniques devised in this
paper ensure that search cost is equivalent to parameterized constant times of
one time social constraint checking on a vastly restricted search space. We
conduct extensive experiments on both real and semi-synthetic datasets for
demonstrating the efficiency of the proposed search algorithm. To evaluate the
effectiveness, we conduct two case studies on real datasets, demonstrating the
superiority of our proposed model.

requiring the robots to jointly select actions, e.g., which trajectory to

large-scale robotic applications, such as multi-robot motion planning for

this paper, we propose a general-purpose distributed algorithm towards robust
optimization at scale, with local communications only. We name it Distributed
Robust Maximization (DRM). DRM proposes a divide-and-conquer approach that
distributively partitions the problem among cliques of robots. Then, the
cliques optimize in parallel, independently of each other. We prove DRM
achieves a close-to-optimal performance. We demonstrate DRM's performance in
both Gazebo and MATLAB simulations, in scenarios of active target tracking with
swarms of robots. In the simulations, DRM achieves computational speed-ups,
being 3-4 orders faster than the centralized algorithms; yet, it nearly matches
the tracking performance of the centralized counterparts. However, DRM
overestimates the number of attacks in each clique. To amend this
conservativeness of DRM, in this paper we also introduce an Improved
Distributed Robust Maximization (IDRM) algorithm. IDRM infers the number of
attacks in each clique less conservatively than DRM by leveraging 3-hop

accuracy more than 96%, while other methods, especially kernel methods, fall
relatively behind? Can we more provide theoretical justifications for this gap?
  Recently, there is an influential line of work relating neural networks to
kernels in the over-parameterized regime, proving they can learn certain
concept class that is also learnable by kernels with similar test error. Yet,
can neural networks provably learn some concept class BETTER than kernels?
  We answer this positively in the distribution-free setting. We prove neural
networks can efficiently learn a notable class of functions, including those
defined by three-layer residual networks with smooth activations, without any
distributional assumption. At the same time, we prove there are simple
functions in this class such that with the same number of training examples,
the test error obtained by neural networks can be MUCH SMALLER than ANY kernel
method, including neural tangent kernels (NTK).
  The main intuition is that multi-layer neural networks can implicitly perform
hierarchical learning using different layers, which reduces the sample
complexity comparing to ""one-shot"" learning algorithms such as kernel methods.
In a follow-up work [2], this theory of hierarchical learning is further
strengthened to incorporate the ""backward feature correction"" process when
training deep networks.
  In the end, we also prove a computation complexity advantage of ResNet with

  Approach to Fairness for Machine Learning","Fairness for Machine Learning has received considerable attention, recently.
Various mathematical formulations of fairness have been proposed, and it has
been shown that it is impossible to satisfy all of them simultaneously. The
literature so far has dealt with these impossibility results by quantifying the
tradeoffs between different formulations of fairness. Our work takes a
different perspective on this issue. Rather than requiring all notions of
fairness to (partially) hold at the same time, we ask which one of them is the
most appropriate given the societal domain in which the decision-making model
is to be deployed. We take a descriptive approach and set out to identify the
notion of fairness that best captures \emph{lay people's perception of
fairness}. We run adaptive experiments designed to pinpoint the most compatible
notion of fairness with each participant's choices through a small number of
tests. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that the most simplistic mathematical
definition of fairness---namely, demographic parity---most closely matches
people's idea of fairness in two distinct application scenarios. This
conclusion remains intact even when we explicitly tell the participants about
the alternative, more complicated definitions of fairness, and we reduce the
cognitive burden of evaluating those notions for them. Our findings have
important implications for the Fair ML literature and the discourse on
formalizing algorithmic fairness.

and a large part of the training process is often spent searching the state
space in a more or less random fashion for any learning signals. For control
problems, we often have some controller readily available which might be
suboptimal but nevertheless solves the problem to some degree. This controller
can be used to guide the initial exploration phase of the learning controller
towards reward yielding states, reducing the time before refinement of a viable
policy can be initiated. In our work, the agent is guided through an auxiliary
behaviour cloning loss which is made conditional on a Q-filter, i.e. it is only
applied in situations where the critic deems the guiding controller to be
better than the agent. The Q-filter provides a natural way to adjust the
guidance throughout the training process, allowing the agent to exceed the
guiding controller in a manner that is adaptive to the task at hand and the
proficiency of the guiding controller. The contribution of this paper lies in
identifying shortcomings in previously proposed implementations of the Q-filter
concept, and in suggesting some ways these issues can be mitigated. These
modifications are tested on the OpenAI Gym Fetch environments, showing clear
improvements in adaptivity and yielding increased performance in all robotic
environments tested.

on polar codes. Serverless computing is an emerging cloud based computation
model that lets users run their functions on the cloud without provisioning or
managing servers. Our proposed approach is a hybrid computing framework that
carries out computationally expensive tasks such as linear algebraic operations
involving large-scale data using serverless computing and does the rest of the
processing locally. We address the limitations and reliability issues of
serverless platforms such as straggling workers using coding theory, drawing
ideas from recent literature on coded computation. The proposed mechanism uses
polar codes to ensure straggler-resilience in a computationally effective
manner. We provide extensive evidence showing polar codes outperform other
coding methods. We have designed a sequential decoder specifically for polar
codes in erasure channels with full-precision input and outputs. In addition,
we have extended the proposed method to the matrix multiplication case where
both matrices being multiplied are coded. The proposed coded computation scheme
is implemented for AWS Lambda. Experiment results are presented where the
performance of the proposed coded computation technique is tested in
optimization via gradient descent. Finally, we introduce the idea of partial
polarization which reduces the computational burden of encoding and decoding at
the expense of straggler-resilience.

  Attention","The trade-off between feature representation power and spatial localization
accuracy is crucial for the dense classification/semantic segmentation of
aerial images. High-level features extracted from the late layers of a neural
network are rich in semantic information, yet have blurred spatial details;
low-level features extracted from the early layers of a network contain more
pixel-level information, but are isolated and noisy. It is therefore difficult
to bridge the gap between high and low-level features due to their difference
in terms of physical information content and spatial distribution. In this
work, we contribute to solve this problem by enhancing the feature
representation in two ways. On the one hand, a patch attention module (PAM) is
proposed to enhance the embedding of context information based on a patch-wise
calculation of local attention. On the other hand, an attention embedding
module (AEM) is proposed to enrich the semantic information of low-level
features by embedding local focus from high-level features. Both of the
proposed modules are light-weight and can be applied to process the extracted
features of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Experiments show that, by
integrating the proposed modules into the baseline Fully Convolutional Network
(FCN), the resulting local attention network (LANet) greatly improves the

  Samples","Given a source of iid samples of edges of an input graph $G$ with $n$
vertices and $m$ edges, how many samples does one need to compute a constant
factor approximation to the maximum matching size in $G$? Moreover, is it
possible to obtain such an estimate in a small amount of space? We show that,
on the one hand, this problem cannot be solved using a nontrivially sublinear
(in $m$) number of samples: $m^{1-o(1)}$ samples are needed. On the other hand,
a surprisingly space efficient algorithm for processing the samples exists:
$O(\log^2 n)$ bits of space suffice to compute an estimate.
  Our main technical tool is a new peeling type algorithm for matching that we
simulate using a recursive sampling process that crucially ensures that local
neighborhood information from `dense' regions of the graph is provided at
appropriately higher sampling rates. We show that a delicate balance between
exploration depth and sampling rate allows our simulation to not lose precision
over a logarithmic number of levels of recursion and achieve a constant factor
approximation. The previous best result on matching size estimation from random
samples was a $\log^{O(1)} n$ approximation [Kapralov et al'14].
  Our algorithm also yields a constant factor approximate local computation
algorithm (LCA) for matching with $O(d\log n)$ exploration starting from any
vertex. Previous approaches were based on local simulations of randomized
greedy, which take $O(d)$ time {\em in expectation over the starting vertex or
edge} (Yoshida et al'09, Onak et al'12), and could not achieve a better than
$d^2$ runtime. Interestingly, we also show that unlike our algorithm, the local
simulation of randomized greedy that is the basis of the most efficient prior
results does take $\wt{\Omega}(d^2)\gg O(d\log n)$ time for a worst case edge
even for $d=\exp(\Theta(\sqrt{\log n}))$.

examples and it remains a challenging task in machine learning. Many
sophisticated few-shot learning algorithms have been proposed based on the
notion that networks can easily overfit to novel examples if they are simply
fine-tuned using only a few examples. In this study, we show that in the
commonly used low-resolution mini-ImageNet dataset, the fine-tuning method
achieves higher accuracy than common few-shot learning algorithms in the 1-shot
task and nearly the same accuracy as that of the state-of-the-art algorithm in
the 5-shot task. We then evaluate our method with more practical tasks, namely
the high-resolution single-domain and cross-domain tasks. With both tasks, we
show that our method achieves higher accuracy than common few-shot learning
algorithms. We further analyze the experimental results and show that: 1) the
retraining process can be stabilized by employing a low learning rate, 2) using
adaptive gradient optimizers during fine-tuning can increase test accuracy, and
3) test accuracy can be improved by updating the entire network when a large
domain-shift exists between base and novel classes.

practical half-duplex mode for the legitimate monitor and dealing with the
challenging case that the suspicious link opportunistically communicates over
parallel fading channels. To increase eavesdropping success probability, we
propose cognitive jamming for the monitor to change the suspicious link's
long-term belief on the parallel channels' distributions, and thereby induce it
to transmit more likely over a smaller subset of unjammed channels with a lower
transmission rate. As the half-duplex monitor cannot eavesdrop the channel that
it is simultaneously jamming to, our jamming design should also control the
probability of such ""own goal"" that occurs when the suspicious link chooses one
of the jammed (uneavesdroppable) channels to transmit. We formulate the optimal
jamming design problem as a mixed integer nonlinear programming and show that
it is non-convex. Nevertheless, we prove that the monitor should optimally use
the maximum jamming power if it decides to jam, for maximally reducing
suspicious link's communication rate and driving the suspicious link out of the
jammed channels. Then we manage to simplify the MINLP to integer programming
and reveal a fundamental trade-off in deciding the number of jammed channels:
jamming more channels helps reduce the suspicious link's communication rate for
overhearing more clearly, but increases own goal probability and thus decreases
eavesdropping success probability. Finally, we extend our study to the two-way
suspicious communication scenario, and show there is another interesting
trade-off in deciding the common jammed channels for balancing bidirectional
eavesdropping performances. Numerical results show that our optimized
jamming-assisted eavesdropping scheme greatly increase eavesdropping success
probability as compared with the conventional passive eavesdropping.

necessary to fully resolve the form factor discrepancy?' With a minimal set of
assumptions and using global fits to unpolarized and polarized elastic
scattering data, I estimate the necessary size of the TPE correction in the
kinematics of the three recent experiments and compare to their measurements. I
find wide variation when using different global fits, implying that the

experimentally realisable approach to obtaining the required Hilbert space
dimension of such a device to compute its time evolution, by exploiting the
thermalization dynamics of a probe qubit. This is achieved by obtaining a
fluctuation-dissipation theorem for high-temperature chaotic quantum systems,
which facilitates the extraction of information on the Hilbert space dimension
via measurements of the decay rate, and time-fluctuations.

selection for multi-task learning. To this end, we propose an efficient
approach to exploit a compact but accurate model in a backbone architecture for
each instance of all tasks. The proposed method consists of an estimator and a
selector. The estimator is based on a backbone architecture and structured
hierarchically. It can produce multiple different network models of different
configurations in a hierarchical structure. The selector chooses a model
dynamically from a pool of candidate models given an input instance. The
selector is a relatively small-size network consisting of a few layers, which
estimates a probability distribution over the candidate models when an input
instance of a task is given. Both estimator and selector are jointly trained in
a unified learning framework in conjunction with a sampling-based learning
strategy, without additional computation steps. We demonstrate the proposed
approach for several image classification tasks compared to existing approaches
performing model selection or learning multiple tasks. Experimental results
show that our approach gives not only outstanding performance compared to other
competitors but also the versatility to perform instance-wise model selection
for multiple tasks.

represents the data such that classifiers can be applied. Most prior work
utilizes frequent pattern mining to define a feature set based on discovered
patterns. However, frequent pattern mining is computationally expensive and
often discovers many irrelevant patterns. To address this shortcoming, we
propose the FIBS framework for classifying IBTSs. FIBS extracts features
relevant to classification from IBTSs based on relative frequency and temporal
relations. To avoid selecting irrelevant features, a filter-based selection
strategy is incorporated into FIBS. Our empirical evaluation on eight
real-world datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our methods in practice.
The results provide evidence that FIBS effectively represents IBTSs for
classification algorithms, which contributes to similar or significantly better
accuracy compared to state-of-the-art competitors. It also suggests that the
feature selection strategy is beneficial to FIBS's performance.

  general artificial intelligence","Perhaps the most ambitious scientific quest in human history is the creation
of general artificial intelligence, which roughly means AI that is as smart or
smarter than humans. The dominant approach in the machine learning community is
to attempt to discover each of the pieces required for intelligence, with the
implicit assumption that some future group will complete the Herculean task of
figuring out how to combine all of those pieces into a complex thinking
machine. I call this the ""manual AI approach"". This paper describes another
exciting path that ultimately may be more successful at producing general AI.
It is based on the clear trend in machine learning that hand-designed solutions
eventually are replaced by more effective, learned solutions. The idea is to
create an AI-generating algorithm (AI-GA), which automatically learns how to
produce general AI. Three Pillars are essential for the approach: (1)
meta-learning architectures, (2) meta-learning the learning algorithms
themselves, and (3) generating effective learning environments. I argue that
either approach could produce general AI first, and both are scientifically
worthwhile irrespective of which is the fastest path. Because both are
promising, yet the ML community is currently committed to the manual approach,
I argue that our community should increase its research investment in the AI-GA
approach. To encourage such research, I describe promising work in each of the
Three Pillars. I also discuss AI-GA-specific safety and ethical considerations.
Because it it may be the fastest path to general AI and because it is
inherently scientifically interesting to understand the conditions in which a
simple algorithm can produce general AI (as happened on Earth where Darwinian
evolution produced human intelligence), I argue that the pursuit of AI-GAs
should be considered a new grand challenge of computer science research.

models the fact that for film atoms there is a preferred interatomic distance

a discrete rigidity estimate is established by regrouping the elastic energy in

terms in the discrete energy, both surface and elastic contributions appear
also in the resulting continuum limit in agreement (and in a form consistent)

  Albedo, Temperature and Active Mechanism from a thermophysical perspective","133P/Elst-Pizarro is the firstly recognized main-belt comet, but we still
know little about its nucleus. Firstly we use mid-infrared data of
Spitzer-MIPS, Spitzer-IRS and WISE to estimate its effective diameter $D_{\rm
eff}=3.9^{+0.4}_{-0.3}$ km, geometric albedo $p_{\rm v}=0.074\pm0.013$ and mean
Bond albedo $A_{\rm eff,B}=0.024\pm0.004$. The albedo is used to compute 133P's
temperature distribution, which shows significant seasonal variation,
especially polar regions, ranging from $\sim40$ to $\sim200$ K. Based on
current activity observations, the maximum water gas production rate is
estimated to be $\sim1.4\times10^{23}\rm~s^{-1}$, being far weaker than
$\sim10^{26}\rm~s^{-1}$ of JFC 67P at similar helio-centric distance $\sim2.7$
AU, indicating a thick dust mantle on the surface to lower down the gas
production rate. The diameter of the sublimation area may be $<\sim200$ m
according to our model prediction. We thus propose that 133P's activity is more
likely to be caused by sublimation of regional near-surface ice patch rather
than homogeneous buried ice layer. Such small near-surface ice patch might be
exposed by one impact event, before which 133P may be an extinct comet (or
ice-rich asteroid) with ice layer buried below $\sim$40 m depth. The proposed
ice patch may be located somewhere within latitude $-50\sim50^\circ$ by
comparing theoretical variation of sublimation temperature to the constraints
from observations. The time scale to form such a thick dust mantle is estimated
to be $>100$ Myr, indicating that 133P may be more likely to be a relatively
old planetesimals or a member of an old family than a recently formed fragment
of some young family.

Minimum Dominating Set and its variant Minimum Connected Dominating Set. For
those two problems, we present algorithms that maintain a solution under edge
insertions and edge deletions in time $O(\Delta\cdot \text{polylog}~n)$ per
update, where $\Delta$ is the maximum vertex degree in the graph. In both
cases, we achieve an approximation ratio of $O(\log n)$, which is optimal up to
a constant factor (under the assumption that $P \ne NP$). Although those two
problems have been widely studied in the static and in the distributed
settings, to the best of our knowledge we are the first to present efficient
algorithms in the dynamic setting.
  As a further application of our approach, we also present an algorithm that
maintains a Minimal Dominating Set in $O(min(\Delta, \sqrt{m}))$ per update.

  study and experimental validation","Quasi-static aberrations in coronagraphic systems are the ultimate limitation
to the capabilities of exoplanet imagers both ground-based and space-based.
These aberrations - which can be due to various causes such as optics alignment
or moving optical parts during the observing sequence - create light residuals
called speckles in the focal plane that might be mistaken for a planets. For
ground-based instruments, the presence of residual turbulent wavefront errors
due to partial adaptive optics correction causes an additional difficulty to
the challenge of measuring aberrations in the presence of a coronagraph. In
this paper, we present an extension of COFFEE, the coronagraphic phase
diversity, to the estimation of quasi-static aberrations in the presence of
adaptive optics-corrected residual turbulence. We perform realistic numerical
simulations to assess the performance that can be expected on an instrument of
the current generation. We perform the first experimental validation in the
laboratory which demonstrates that quasistatic aberrations can be corrected
during the observations by means of coronagraphic phase diversity.

  in uniform and nonuniform stratifications","Triadic resonance is one mechanism via which internal waves dissipate their
energy, often at locations away from their generation sites. In this paper, we
perform a combined theoretical and numerical study of triadic resonance in
internal wave modes in a finite-depth ocean with background rotation and an
arbitrary stratification profile. The spatial evolution of the modal amplitudes
within a resonant triad are first derived based on the requirement that the
nonlinear solution at leading order cannot diverge. The amplitude evolution
equations are then numerically solved for two different cases: (i) modes 1 and
2 at a specific frequency ({\omega_0}) in triadic resonance with the mode-1
superharmonic wave (2{\omega_0}) in a uniform stratification, and (ii) a
self-interacting mode-3 at a specific frequency {\omega_0} in triadic resonance
with the mode-2 (2{\omega_0}) in a nonuniform stratification representative of
the ocean. Quantitative estimates of energy transfer rates within the resonant
triad show that superharmonic wave generation resulting from modal interactions
should be an important consideration alongside other triadic resonances like
parametric subharmonic instability (PSI). Remarkably, in case (ii), the
amplitude evolution equations suggest that any initial energy in mode-3 at
{\omega_0} would get permanently transferred to mode-2 at frequency
2{\omega_0}. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) are then performed to show the
spontaneous generation of superharmonic internal waves resulting from modal
interactions in the aforementioned two cases, and quantitatively validate the
initial spatial evolution of the wave field predicted by the amplitude
evolution equations. DNS at off-resonant frequencies are used to identify the
range of primary wave frequencies (around the resonant frequency) over which
spontaneous superharmonic wave generation occurs.

  and Related Application to Electromyogram Classification","Electromyogram (EMG) classification is a key technique in EMG-based control
systems. The existing EMG classification methods do not consider the
characteristics of EMG features that the distribution has skewness and
kurtosis, causing drawbacks such as the requirement of hyperparameter tuning.
In this paper, we propose a neural network based on the Johnson $S_\mathrm{U}$
translation system that is capable of representing distributions with skewness
and kurtosis. The Johnson system is a normalizing translation that transforms
non-normal data to a normal distribution, thereby enabling the representation
of a wide range of distributions. In this study, a discriminative model based
on the multivariate Johnson $S_\mathrm{U}$ translation system is transformed
into a linear combination of coefficients and input vectors using
log-linearization. This is then incorporated into a neural network structure,
thereby allowing the calculation of the posterior probability of the input
vectors for each class and the determination of model parameters as weight
coefficients of the network. The uniqueness of convergence of the network
learning is theoretically guaranteed. In the experiments, the suitability of
the proposed network for distributions including skewness and kurtosis is
evaluated using artificially generated data. Its applicability for real
biological data is also evaluated via an EMG classification experiment. The
results show that the proposed network achieves high classification performance
without the need for hyperparameter optimization.

  Space","We focus on the challenge of finding a diverse collection of quality
solutions on complex continuous domains. While quality diver-sity (QD)
algorithms like Novelty Search with Local Competition (NSLC) and MAP-Elites are
designed to generate a diverse range of solutions, these algorithms require a
large number of evaluations for exploration of continuous spaces. Meanwhile,
variants of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) are
among the best-performing derivative-free optimizers in single-objective
continuous domains. This paper proposes a new QD algorithm called Covariance
Matrix Adaptation MAP-Elites (CMA-ME). Our new algorithm combines the
self-adaptation techniques of CMA-ES with archiving and mapping techniques for
maintaining diversity in QD. Results from experiments based on standard
continuous optimization benchmarks show that CMA-ME finds better-quality
solutions than MAP-Elites; similarly, results on the strategic game Hearthstone
show that CMA-ME finds both a higher overall quality and broader diversity of
strategies than both CMA-ES and MAP-Elites. Overall, CMA-ME more than doubles
the performance of MAP-Elites using standard QD performance metrics. These
results suggest that QD algorithms augmented by operators from state-of-the-art
optimization algorithms can yield high-performing methods for simultaneously
exploring and optimizing continuous search spaces, with significant
applications to design, testing, and reinforcement learning among other
domains.

improving accuracy for some tasks and easing development effort. It also offers
scalability to add more tasks leveraging existing features and achieving better

absorption line variability response to ionization changes is not monotonic. 8

involving local interactions of a photon, a dark photon and a axion-like
particle (ALP) at future $e^+e^-$ colliders. These interactions, mediated by
higher-dimensional effective operators, may arise at one-loop by kinetic mixing
between dark and ordinary photons, or, for massless dark photons, by direct
short-distance contributions. We explore these portal interactions for a heavy
ALP with masses between about 10 GeV and 230 GeV by investigating the
sensitivity of the production $e^+e^- \to \gamma \gamma \bar{\gamma}$ to the
effective couplings, where the dark photon $\bar\gamma$ gives rise to missing
momentum in the final state. We will show how an appropriate choice of
missing-energy and missing-mass cuts can optimize the signal to standard-model
background ratio. Exclusion regions for the effective photon-dark-photon-ALP
couplings versus the ALP mass are worked out for a few representative values of

linked to. Strikingly, high-rank patents are twice as valuable as low-rank
patents, which in turn are about as valuable as patents without direct science
link. We show this core result for various science quality and patent value
measures. The effect of science quality on patent value remains relevant even
when science is linked indirectly through other patents. Our findings imply
that what is considered ""excellent"" within the science sector also leads to
outstanding outcomes in the technological or commercial realm.

find that the classical transport of a collisional impurity is comparable to
the neoclassical transport for all radii, while it is negligible in the LHD
cases, except in the vicinity of radii where the neoclassical transport changes

significantly enhance the neoclassical impurity transport, while the classical
transport is largely insensitive to this effect in the cases studied.

ecological environment are ubiquitously found in nature, and have shown
profound effects on the resulting eco-evolutionary dynamics. Incorporating
linear environmental feedback law into replicator dynamics of two-player games,
recent theoretical studies shed light on understanding the oscillating dynamics
of social dilemma. However, detailed effects of more general nonlinear feedback
loops in multi-player games, which is more common especially in microbial
systems, remain unclear. Here, we focus on ecological public goods games with
environmental feedbacks driven by nonlinear selection gradient. Unlike previous
models, multiple segments of stable and unstable equilibrium manifolds can
emerge from the population dynamical systems. We find that a larger relative
asymmetrical feedback speed for group interactions centered on cooperators not
only accelerates the convergence of stable manifolds, but also increases the
attraction basin of these stable manifolds. Furthermore, our work offers an
innovative manifold control approach: by designing appropriate switching
control laws, we are able to steer the eco-evolutionary dynamics to any desired
population states. Our mathematical framework is an important generalization
and complement to coevolutionary game dynamics, and also fills the theoretical
gap in guiding the widespread problem of population state control in microbial
experiments.

Kilometre Array (SKA) will play in the cosmological parameter estimation in the
future. To test the constraint capability of the redshift drift data of
SKA-only, the $\Lambda$CDM model is chosen as a reference model. We find that
using the SKA1 mock data, the $\Lambda$CDM model can be loosely constrained,
while the model can be well constrained when the SKA2 mock data are used. When
the mock data of SKA are combined with the data of the European Extremely Large
Telescope (E-ELT), the constraints can be significantly improved almost as good
as the data combination of the type Ia supernovae observation (SN), the cosmic
microwave background observation (CMB), and the baryon acoustic oscillations
observation (BAO). Furthermore, we explore the impact of the redshift drift
data of SKA on the basis of SN+CMB+BAO+E-ELT in the $\Lambda$CDM model, the
$w$CDM model, the CPL model, and the HDE model. We find that the redshift drift
measurement of SKA could help to significantly improve the constraints on dark
energy and could break the degeneracy between the cosmological parameters.
Therefore, we conclude that redshift-drift observation of SKA would provide a
good improvement in the cosmological parameter estimation in the future and has
the enormous potential to be one of the most competitive cosmological probes in
constraining dark energy.

  frequency uncertainty","There has been tremendous progress in the performance of optical frequency
standards since the first proposals to carry out precision spectroscopy on
trapped, single ions in the 1970s. The estimated fractional frequency
uncertainty of today's leading optical standards is currently in the $10^{-18}$
range, approximately two orders of magnitude better than that of the best
caesium primary frequency standards. This exceptional accuracy and stability is
resulting in a growing number of research groups developing optical clocks.
While good review papers covering the topic already exist, more practical
guidelines are needed as a complement. The purpose of this document is
therefore to provide technical guidance for researchers starting in the field
of optical clocks. The target audience includes national metrology institutes
(NMIs) wanting to set up optical clocks (or subsystems thereof) and PhD
students and postdocs entering the field. Another potential audience is
academic groups with experience in atomic physics and atom or ion trapping, but
with less experience of time and frequency metrology and optical clock
requirements. These guidelines have arisen from the scope of the EMPIR project
""Optical clocks with $1 \times 10^{-18}$ uncertainty"" (OC18). Therefore, the
examples are from European laboratories even though similar work is carried out
all over the world. The goal of OC18 was to push the development of optical
clocks by improving each of the necessary subsystems: ultrastable lasers,
neutral-atom and single-ion traps, and interrogation techniques. This document
shares the knowledge acquired by the OC18 project consortium and gives
practical guidance on each of these aspects.

price, whose dynamics can be affected by the actions of a representative
risk--neutral producer and a representative risk--neutral trader. Depending on
the model, the producer can control the drift and/or the volatility of the
price whereas the trader can at most affect the volatility. The producer can
affect the volatility in two ways: either by randomizing her production rate
or, as the trader, using other means such as spreading false information.
Moreover, the producer contracts at time zero a fixed position in a European
convex derivative with the trader. The trader can be price-taker, as in the
first two models, or she can also affect the volatility of the commodity price,
as in the third model. We solve all three models semi--explicitly and give
closed--form expressions of the derivative price over a small time horizon,
preventing arbitrage opportunities to arise. We find that when the trader is
price-taker, the producer can always compensate the loss in expected production
profit generated by an increase of volatility by a gain in the derivative
position by driving the price at maturity to a suitable level. Finally, in case
the trader is active, the model takes the form of a nonzero-sum
linear-quadratic stochastic differential game and we find that when the
production rate is already at its optimal stationary level, there is an amount
of derivative position that makes both players better off when entering the
game.

compound is also a heavy fermion material with a large specific heat
coefficient $\gamma$=110 mJ $\cdot$ mol$^{-1}$ $\cdot$ K$^{-2}$ and a high
Kondo temperature of $T_{K}$=50 K indicative that CeRhSi$_{3}$ is in a strongly
Kondo screened state. We apply high resolution neutron spectroscopy to
investigate the magnetic fluctuations in the normal phase, at ambient
pressures, and at low temperatures. We measure a commensurate dynamic response
centered around the $\vec{Q}$=(0, 0, 2) position that gradually evolves to
H$\sim$ 0.2 with decreasing temperature and/or energy transfers. The response
is broadened both in momentum and energy and not reminiscent of sharp spin wave
excitations found in insulating magnets where the electrons are localized. We
parameterize the excitation spectrum and temperature dependence using a
heuristic model utilizing the random phase approximation to couple relaxing
Ce$^{3+}$ ground state Kramers doublets with a Kondo-like dynamic response.
With a Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) exchange interaction within the
$ab$ plane and an increasing single site susceptibility, we can qualitatively
reproduce the neutron spectroscopic results in CeRhSi$_{3}$ and namely the
trade-off between scattering at commensurate and incommensurate positions. We
suggest that the antiferromagnetic phase in CeRhSi$_{3}$ is driven by weakly
correlated relaxing localized Kramers doublets and that CeRhSi$_{3}$ at ambient
pressures is on the border between a Rudderman-Kittel-Yosida antiferromagnetic
state and a Kondo screened phase where static magnetism is predominately
absent.

  Be/X-ray binaries","Giant outbursts of Be/X-ray binaries may occur when a Be-star disc undergoes
strong eccentricity growth due to the Kozai-Lidov (KL) mechanism. The KL effect
acts on a disc that is highly inclined to the binary orbital plane provided
that the disc aspect ratio is sufficiently small. The eccentric disc overflows
its Roche lobe and material flows from the Be star disc over to the companion
neutron star causing X-ray activity. With N-body simulations and steady state
decretion disc models we explore system parameters for which a disc in the
Be/X-ray binary 4U 0115+634 is KL unstable and the resulting timescale for the
oscillations. We find good agreement between predictions of the model and the
observed giant outburst timescale provided that the disc is not completely
destroyed by the outburst. This allows the outer disc to be replenished between
outbursts and a sufficiently short KL oscillation timescale. An initially
eccentric disc has a shorter KL oscillation timescale compared to an initially
circular orbit disc. We suggest that the chaotic nature of the outbursts is
caused by the sensitivity of the mechanism to the distribution of material
within the disc. The outbursts continue provided that the Be star supplies
material that is sufficiently misaligned to the binary orbital plane. We
generalise our results to Be/X-ray binaries with varying orbital period and
find that if the Be star disc is flared, it is more likely to be unstable to KL
oscillations in a smaller orbital period binary, in agreement with
observations.

architecture consisting of centralized decision making and distributed resource
sharing (the C-Decision scheme) to maximize the long-term sum rate of all
vehicles. To reduce the network signaling overhead, each vehicle uses a deep
neural network to compress its observed information that is thereafter fed back
to the centralized decision making unit. The centralized decision unit employs
a deep Q-network to allocate resources and then sends the decision results to
all vehicles. We further adopt a quantization layer for each vehicle that
learns to quantize the continuous feedback. In addition, we devise a mechanism
to balance the transmission of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links and
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links. To further facilitate distributed
spectrum sharing, we also propose a distributed decision making and spectrum
sharing architecture (the D-Decision scheme) for each V2V link. Through
extensive simulation results, we demonstrate that the proposed C-Decision and

dynamics with feedback but still relatively little is known about what
determines the stability of the steady states and their switching rates in
terms of entropy and entropy production. Here, we will link fluctuation
theorems for the entropy production along trajectories with the action
obtainable from the Freidlin--Wentzell theorem to elucidate the thermodynamics
of switching between states in the large volume limit of multistable systems.
We find that the entropy production at steady state plays no role, but the
entropy production during switching is key. Steady-state entropy and diffusive
noise strength can be neglected in this limit. The relevance to biology,
ecological, and climate models is apparent.

  III. Sun-as-a-star Simulations and Optimal Noise Diagnostics","Stellar surface magnetoconvection (granulation) creates asymmetries in the
observed stellar absorption lines that can subsequently manifest themselves as
spurious radial velocities shifts. In turn, this can then mask the
Doppler-reflex motion induced by orbiting planets on their host stars, and
represents a particular challenge for determining the masses of low-mass,
long-period planets. Herein, we study this impact by creating Sun-as-a-star
observations that encapsulate the granulation variability expected from 3D
magnetohydrodynamic simulations. These Sun-as-a-star model observations are in
good agreement with empirical observations of the Sun, but may underestimate
the total variability relative to the quiet Sun due to the increased magnetic
field strength in our models. We find numerous line profile characteristics
linearly correlate with the disc-integrated convection-induced velocities.
Removing the various correlations with the line bisector, equivalent width, and
the V_asy indicator may reduce ~50-60% of the granulation noise in the measured
velocities. We also find that simultaneous photometry may be a key diagnostic,
as our proxy for photometric brightness also allowed us to remove ~50% of the
granulation-induced radial velocity noise. These correlations and
granulation-noise mitigations breakdown in the presence of low instrumental
resolution and/or increased stellar rotation, as both act to smooth the
observed line profile asymmetries.

  learning","Diffusion magnetic resonance imaging is a noninvasive imaging technique that
can indirectly infer the microstructure of tissues and provide metrics which
are subject to normal variability across subjects. Potentially abnormal values
or features may yield essential information to support analysis of controls and
patients cohorts, but subtle confounds affecting diffusion MRI, such as those
due to difference in scanning protocols or hardware, can lead to systematic
errors which could be mistaken for purely biologically driven variations
amongst subjects. In this work, we propose a new harmonization algorithm based
on adaptive dictionary learning to mitigate the unwanted variability caused by
different scanner hardware while preserving the natural biological variability
present in the data. Overcomplete dictionaries, which are learned automatically
from the data and do not require paired samples, are then used to reconstruct
the data from a different scanner, removing variability present in the source
scanner in the process. We use the publicly available database from an
international challenge to evaluate the method, which was acquired on three
different scanners and with two different protocols, and propose a new mapping
towards a scanner-agnostic space. Results show that the effect size of the four
studied diffusion metrics is preserved while removing variability attributable
to the scanner. Experiments with alterations using a free water compartment,
which is not simulated in the training data, shows that the effect size induced
by the alterations is also preserved after harmonization. The algorithm is
freely available and could help multicenter studies in pooling their data,
while removing scanner specific confounds, and increase statistical power in
the process.

this paper is defined by easiness to predict the change of the inference when
perturbating the model of the DNNs. In addition, we introduce one example of

Symbolic computation is a powerful technique for reasoning about the
correctness of concurrent systems and for increasing the power of formal tools.
We present several new symbolic features of Maude that enhance formal reasoning
about Maude programs and the effectiveness of formal tools. They include: (i)
very general unification modulo user-definable equational theories, and (ii)
symbolic reachability analysis of concurrent systems using narrowing. The paper
does not focus just on symbolic features: it also describes several other new

rewriting, and (iv) external objects that allow flexible interaction of Maude
object-based concurrent systems with the external world. In particular,
meta-interpreters are external objects encapsulating Maude interpreters that
can interact with many other objects. To make the paper self-contained and give
a reasonably complete language overview, we also review the basic Maude

of concurrent object systems, and reflection. Furthermore, we include many

stages. In the first stage, a simple delay-and-sum (DS) beamformer is used to
enhance the signal impinging from the speaker location which is then used to
estimate a time-frequency mask corresponding to the localized speaker using a
neural network. This mask is used to compute the second order statistics and to
derive an adaptive beamformer in the third stage. We generated a multichannel,

chiral spin chain [Cu(pym)(H$_2$O)$_4$]SiF$_6\cdot$H$_2$O (pym = pyrimidine).
Electron-spin resonance, magnetometry and heat capacity measurements reveal the
presence of staggered $g$ tensors, a rich low-temperature excitation spectrum,
a staggered susceptibility and a spin gap that opens on the application of a
magnetic field. These phenomena are reminiscent of those previously observed in
non-chiral staggered chains, which are explicable within the sine-Gordon
quantum-field theory. In the present case, however, although the sine-Gordon
model accounts well for the form of the temperature-dependence of the heat

fit with the sine-Gordon theory as it stands. We propose that the differences
arise due to additional terms in the Hamiltonian resulting from the chiral

Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya coupling and a four-fold periodic staggered field.

magnitude lower luminosity than do the other known quasars at z > 7. The
rest-frame ultraviolet absolute magnitude is M1450 = -24.13 +/- 0.08 mag and
the bolometric luminosity is Lbol = (1.4 +/- 0.1) x 10^{46} erg/s. Its spectrum
in the optical to near-infrared shows strong emission lines, and shows evidence
for a fast gas outflow, as the C IV line is blueshifted and there is indication
of broad absorption lines. The Mg II-based black hole mass is Mbh = (3.3 +/-
2.0) x 10^8 Msun, thus indicating a moderate mass accretion rate with an
Eddington ratio 0.34 +/- 0.20. It is the first z > 7 quasar with sub-Eddington
accretion, besides being the third most distant quasar, known to date. The
luminosity and black hole mass are comparable to, or even lower than, those

convolutional neural networks. Nonetheless, most of the previous methods may
not work well in recognizing text with low resolution which is often seen in
natural scene images. An intuitive solution is to introduce super-resolution
techniques as pre-processing. However, conventional super-resolution methods in
the literature mainly focus on reconstructing the detailed texture of natural
images, which typically do not work well for text due to the unique
characteristics of text. To tackle these problems, in this work, we propose a
content-aware text super-resolution network to generate the information desired
for text recognition. In particular, we design an end-to-end network that can
perform super-resolution and text recognition simultaneously. Different from
previous super-resolution methods, we use the loss of text recognition as the
Text Perceptual Loss to guide the training of the super-resolution network, and
thus it pays more attention to the text content, rather than the irrelevant
background area. Extensive experiments on several challenging benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method in restoring a sharp
high-resolution image from a small blurred one, and show that the recognition
performance clearly boosts up the performance of text recognizer. To our
knowledge, this is the first work focusing on text super-resolution. Code will
be released in https://github.com/xieenze/TextSR.

Monte-Carlo simulations shows that (i) the competition between the long-range
Coulomb interaction (due to bound charges) and short-range interaction (due to
opposite dipoles) is responsible for the formation of these peculiar domain
walls and (ii) their relative strength is critical in determining the
periodicity of these sawtooth-shaped domain walls. Necessary conditions to form
such domain walls are also discussed.

reduced to the question whether or not the first party can perform measurements
such that the conditional states on the second party can be explained by a
local hidden state model. Clearly, the answer to this depends on the
measurements which the first party is able to perform. We introduce a local
hidden state model explaining the conditional states for all generalized
measurements on Bell-diagonal states of two qubits. More precisely, it is known
for the restricted case of projective measurements and Bell-diagonal states
characterised by the correlation matrix $T$ that a local hidden state model
exists if and only if $R_T= 2 \pi N_T |\det (T)| \ge 1$, where $N_T$ is defined
by an integral over the Bloch sphere. For generalized measurements described by
positive operator valued measures we construct a model if $R_T \ge 6/5$. Our
work paves the way for a systematic study of steerability of quantum states
with generalized measurements beyond the highly-symmetric Werner states.

with masses in the range from 0.3 to 0.75 Msun from the HArps-N red Dwarf
Exoplanet Survey (HADES) radial velocity (RV) programme collected from ROSAT

analysing time-series of high-resolution spectroscopy of the Ca ii H & K and
H{\alpha} activity indicators. Our sample principally covers the slow rotation
regime with rotation periods from 15 to 60 days. Results. Our work extends to
the low mass regime the observed trend for more massive stars showing a
continuous shift of the Lx/Lbol vs. Prot power-law towards longer rotation
period values and includes the determination, in a more accurate way, of the
value of the rotation period at which the saturation occurs (P_{sat}) for M

minimisation for both finite and infinite Stochastic Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)

the cases where the number of available words of memory is limited. Designing
an efficient regret minimisation algorithm that uses a constant number of words
has long been interesting to the community. Some early attempts consider the
number of arms to be infinite, and require the reward distribution of the arms
to belong to some particular family. Recently, for finitely many-armed bandits
an explore-then-commit based algorithm~\citep{Liau+PSY:2018} seems to escape
such assumption. However, due to the underlying PAC-based elimination their
method incurs a high regret. We present a conceptually simple, and efficient
algorithm that needs to remember statistics of at most $M$ arms, and for any
$K$-armed finite bandit instance it enjoys a $O(KM +K^{1.5}\sqrt{T\log

limited search space. By creating a novel neural architecture search with
options for dense layers to connect with convolution layers and vice-versa as
well as the addition of concatenation layers in the search, we were able to
evolve an architecture that is inherently accurate on adversarial samples.
Interestingly, this inherent robustness of the evolved architecture rivals
state-of-the-art defences such as adversarial training while being trained only
on the non-adversarial samples. Moreover, the evolved architecture makes use of
some peculiar traits which might be useful for developing even more robust
ones. Thus, the results here confirm that more robust architectures exist as
well as opens up a new realm of feasibilities for the development and
exploration of neural networks.

  and annealing","Hematite as promising photoanode for solar water splitting suffers from
severe bulk and surface charge recombination. This work describes that a
protonation-annealing treatment can effectively suppress both bulk and surface
charge recombination in hematite. Protons/electrons are electrochemically
incorporated into hematite under 0.2 VRHE followed by annealing at 120 oC. The
photocurrent density increases from ~0.9 mA cm-2 to 1.8 mA cm-2 at 1.23 VRHE
under 1 sun, and further to 2.7 mA cm-2 after loading cobalt phosphate,
stabilizing at round 2.4 mA cm-2. A cathodic shift of the onset potential of
photocurrent is also observed. H2O2 oxidation, impedance spectroscopy and
Mott-Schottky measurements show that the protonation suppresses bulk
recombination and enhances donor density, but introducing more surface
recombination. The annealing reduces surface recombination, while preserving
relatively high bulk charge separation efficiency. Different from previous
reports on the electrochemically reduced hematite, this work demonstrates that
the performance improvement should be ascribed to the proton incorporation
instead of the formation of Fe3O4 or metal Fe. This facile treatment by
protonation and annealing could be applied in other semiconductors to promote
the development of high performing photoelectrodes.

that complements the charge motion around the ring. We present a direct mapping

  Neural Network Dynamics","This paper aims to solve a distributed resource allocation problem with
binary local constraints. The problem is formulated as a binary program with a
cost function defined by the summation of agent costs plus a global

Newton-like weighting factor. This addition lends itself to fast avoidance of
saddle points, which the gradient-like HNN is susceptible to. Turning to a
multi-agent setting, we reformulate the problem and develop a distributed

the distributed reformulation is obtained, it is also a local solution to the
centralized problem. A main contribution of this work is to show that the
probability of converging to a saddle point of an appropriately defined energy
function in both the centralized and distributed settings is zero under light
assumptions. Finally, we enlarge our algorithm with an annealing technique
which gradually learns a feasible binary solution. Simulation results
demonstrate that the proposed methods are competitive with centralized greedy

one-class kernel spectral regression, a.k.a. OC-KSR) is known to be an
effective and computationally attractive one-class classification framework.
Despite its outstanding performance, the applicability of kernel null-space
method is limited due to its susceptibility to possible training data
corruptions and inability to rank training observations according to their
conformity with the model. This work addresses these shortcomings by studying
the effect of regularising the solution of the null-space kernel Fisher
methodology in the context of its regression-based formulation (OC-KSR). In
this respect, first, the effect of a Tikhonov regularisation in the Hilbert
space is analysed where the one-class learning problem in presence of
contaminations in the training set is posed as a sensitivity analysis problem.
Next, driven by the success of the sparse representation methodology, the
effect of a sparsity regularisation on the solution is studied. For both
alternative regularisation schemes, iterative algorithms are proposed which
recursively update label confidences and rank training observations based on
their fit with the model. Through extensive experiments conducted on different
data sets, the proposed methodology is found to enhance robustness against
contamination in the training set as compared with the baseline kernel
null-space technique as well as other existing approaches in a one-class
classification paradigm while providing the functionality to rank training
samples effectively.

non-commutative (NC) space-time is a long-standing problem with a number of
solutions, none of which is free from criticism. In this work, we discuss the
approach proposed in arXiv:1803.00732, based on the conjecture that any
consistent gauge theory can be described in terms of the $L_\infty$-structure.
Starting with a well-defined commutative gauge theory, we represent it,
together with the non-commutative deformation, as a part of a bigger
$L_\infty$-algebra by setting some initial brackets $\ell_1$, $\ell_2$, etc.
Then, solving the $L_\infty$-relations we determine the missing brackets
$\ell_n$ and close the $L_\infty$-algebra defining the NC gauge theory which
reproduces in the commutative limit the original one. We provide the recurrence
relations for the construction of the pure gauge algebra $L^{\rm
gauge}_\infty$, using which we find an explicit form of the NC
$\mathfrak{su}(2)$-like and non-associative octonionic-like deformations of the
Abelian gauge transformations. The construction of the $L^{\rm
full}_\infty$-algebra describing the dynamics is discussed using the example of
the NC Chern-Simons theory. The obtained equations of motion are
non-Lagrangian, which indicates the difference between our approach and the
previous ones.

  on the Smallest Scales","Quantum chaos is presented as a paradigm of information processing by
dynamical systems at the bottom of the range of phase-space scales. Starting
with a brief review of classical chaos as entropy flow from micro- to
macro-scales, I argue that quantum chaos came as an indispensable
rectification, removing inconsistencies related to entropy in classical chaos:
Bottom-up information currents require an inexhaustible entropy production and
a diverging information density in phase space, reminiscent of Gibbs' paradox
in Statistical Mechanics. It is shown how a mere discretization of the state
space of classical models already entails phenomena similar to hallmarks of
quantum chaos, and how the unitary time evolution in a closed system directly
implies the ''quantum death'' of classical chaos. As complementary evidence, I
discuss quantum chaos under continuous measurement. Here, the two-way exchange
of information with a macroscopic apparatus opens an inexhaustible source of
entropy and lifts the limitations implied by unitary quantum dynamics in closed
systems. The infiltration of fresh entropy restores permanent chaotic dynamics
in observed quantum systems. Could other instances of stochasticity in quantum
mechanics be interpreted in a similar guise? Where observed quantum systems
generate randomness, that is, produce entropy without discernible source, could
it have infiltrated from the macroscopic meter? This speculation is worked out
for the case of spin measurement.

  near field and far field","Micro-nanoparticle systems have wide applications in thermal science and
technology. In dense particulate system, the particle separation distance may
be less than the characteristic thermal wavelength and near field effect will
be significant and become a key factor to influence thermal radiation transfer
in the system. In this study, radiative heat transfer (RHT) between two
metallic nanoparticles clusters are explored using many-body radiative heat
transfer theory implemented with the coupled electric and magnetic dipole
(CEMD) approach, which effectively takes into account the contribution of
magnetic polarization of metallic nanoparticles on heat exchange. As the focus,
the effects of magnetic polarization and many-body interaction (MBI) on RHT
were analyzed. The effects of fractal dimension and relative orientation of the
clusters were also analyzed. Results show that the contribution of magnetically
polarized eddy-current Joule dissipation dominates the RHT between Ag
nanoparticle clusters. If only electric polarization (EP approach) is
considered, the heat conductance will be underestimated as compared with the
CEMD approach in both near field and far field regime. The effect of MBI on the
RHT between Ag nanoparticle clusters is unobvious at room temperature, which is
quite different from the SiC nanoparticle clusters. For the latter, MBI tends
to suppress RHT significantly. The relative orientation has remarkable effect
on radiative heat flux for clusters with lacy structure when the separation
distance is in the near field. While for the separation distance in far field,
both the relative orientation and the fractal dimension has a weak influence on
radiative heat flux. This work will help the understanding of thermal transport
in dense particulate system.

evolution of a given particle depends on its own conditional distribution given
its past trajectory. We also analyze the asymptotic behavior of the system when
the edge dynamics is accelerated. A law of large number and a propagation of
chaos result is established, and the limiting system is given as independent
McKean-Vlasov processes. Error between the two limiting systems, with and
without acceleration in edge dynamics, is also analyzed.

  Under Open- and Short-Circuit Switch Failures","In this paper, a new fault tolerant dc-ac converter-fed induction motor drive
is proposed to maintain motor as close as possible to its desired normal
operation under open- and short-circuit switch failures. The operational
principles for fault detection and isolation schemes are provided. Two control
strategies including predictive control and voltage mode-controlled PWM with
integral-double-lead controller for two stage of the converter are presented in
conjunction with the elaborated discussion. The control strategy determines
appropriate switching states for continuous operation of the drive after a
fault. The proposed topology makes it possible to integrate the minimal
redundant hardware and full tolerance capability which is an important
advantage of the proposed topology. Moreover, the most important advantages of
the proposed topology are a fast response in a fault condition and low cost of
the converter in comparison with the evaluated topologies. A
Joule-integral-based method for selecting an appropriate rating of applied
fuses has been presented to provide a reliable fault-isolation operation. Also,
a comparison with currently available fault-tolerant dc-ac converters is given
to show the merits of the proposed topology. Finally, the experimental results
are presented to verify the validity of the theoretical analysis and industrial
feasibility of the proposed converter.

ballistic propagation of fluid waves, give exact transport results in many-body
systems, such as the exact Drude weights. Focussing one one-dimensional
systems, I show that this principle can be extended beyond the Euler scale, in
particular to the diffusive and superdiffusive scales. By hydrodynamic
reduction, Hilbert spaces of observables are constructed that generalise the
standard space of conserved densities and describe the finer scales of
hydrodynamics. The Green-Kubo formula for the Onsager matrix has a natural
expression within the diffusive space. This space is associated with
quadratically extensive charges, and projections onto any such charge give
generic lower bounds for diffusion. In particular, bilinear expressions in
linearly extensive charges lead to explicit diffusion lower bounds calculable
from the thermodynamics, and applicable for instance to generic
momentum-conserving one-dimensional systems. Bilinear charges are interpreted
as covariant derivatives on the manifold of maximal entropy states, and
represent the contribution to diffusion from scattering of ballistic waves. An
analysis of fractionally extensive charges, combined with clustering properties
from the superdiffusion phenomenology, gives lower bounds for superdiffusion
exponents. These bounds reproduce the predictions of nonlinear fluctuating
hydrodynamics, including the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang exponent 2/3 for sound-like
modes, the Levy-distribution exponent 3/5 for heat-like modes, and the full
Fibonacci sequence.

  cold disk regime","We study the properties of rotating accretion flows onto supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) using axisymmetric two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations
with radiative cooling and BH feedback. The simulations resolve the accretion
dynamics of gas outside from the BH influence radius through an inner accretion
disk. For lower Bondi accretion rates in units of the Eddington rate
($\dot{M}_{\rm B}\ll 10^{-3}~\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), the BH feeding is suppressed
due to turbulent motion by several orders of magnitudes from the Bondi rate.
Thus, the radiative luminosity results in as low as $\sim
10^{-10}-10^{-7}~L_{\rm Edd}$, where $L_{\rm Edd}$ is the Eddington luminosity.
For higher rates of $\dot{M}_{\rm B}> 10^{-3}~\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$, the
optically-thin accreting gas cools via free-free emission and forms a
geometrically-thin disk, which feeds the BH efficiently and increases the
radiative luminosity to $> 10^{-3}~L_{\rm Edd}$. The transitional behavior of
accreting BHs in galactic nuclei from radiatively inefficient phases to cold
disk accretion naturally explains (1) the reason for the offset between the
observed luminosities and theoretical predictions for nearby quiescent SMBHs,
and (2) the conditions to fuel gas into the nuclear SMBH. In addition, the cold
disk formed in galactic nuclei tends to be gravitationally unstable and leads
to star formation when the Bondi rate is as high as $ \dot{M}_{\rm B} >
10^{-2}~M_\odot~{\rm yr}^{-1}$. This is a plausible explanation of the
correlation observed between star formation rates and BH feeding rates in
Seyfert galaxies.

exceedance (FDX) for large scale multiple testing problems, among them the
Lehmann-Romano procedure ([LR] below) and the Guo-Romano procedure ([GR]
below). While these two procedures are the most prominent, they were originally
designed for homogeneous test statistics, that is, when the null distribution
functions of the $p$-values $F_i$, $1\leq i\leq m$, are all equal. In many
applications, however, the data are heterogeneous which leads to heterogeneous
null distribution functions. Ignoring this heterogeneity usually induces a
conservativeness for the aforementioned procedures. In this paper, we develop
three new procedures that incorporate the $F_i$'s, while ensuring the FDX
control. The heterogeneous version of [LR], denoted [HLR], is based on the
arithmetic average of the $F_i$'s, while the heterogeneous version of [GR],
denoted [HGR], is based on the geometric average of the $F_i$'s. We also
introduce a procedure [PB], that is based on the Poisson-binomial distribution
and that uniformly improves [HLR] and [HGR], at the price of a higher
computational complexity. Perhaps surprisingly, this shows that, contrary to
the known theory of false discovery rate (FDR) control under heterogeneity, the
way to incorporate the $F_i$'s can be particularly simple in the case of FDX
control, and does not require any further correction term. The performances of
the new proposed procedures are illustrated by real and simulated data in two
important heterogeneous settings: first, when the test statistics are
continuous but the $p$-values are weighted by some known independent weight
vector, e.g., coming from co-data sets; second, when the test statistics are
discretely distributed, as is the case for data representing frequencies or
counts.

for the possibility that individuals' outcomes are affected by group-level
discrimination. Injecting a single non-classical assumption, that the agent is
overconfident about himself, we explain key observed patterns in social
beliefs, and make a number of additional predictions. First, the agent believes
in discrimination against any group he is in more than an outsider does,
capturing widely observed self-centered views of discrimination. Second, the
more group memberships the agent shares with an individual, the more positively
he evaluates the individual. This explains one of the most basic facts about
social judgments, in-group bias, as well as ""legitimizing myths"" that justify
an arbitrary social hierarchy through the perceived superiority of the
privileged group. Third, biases are sensitive to how the agent divides society
into groups when evaluating outcomes. This provides a reason why some
ethnically charged questions should not be asked, as well as a potential
channel for why nation-building policies might be effective. Fourth, giving the
agent more accurate information about himself increases all his biases. Fifth,
the agent is prone to substitute biases, implying that the introduction of a
new outsider group to focus on creates biases against the new group but lowers
biases vis a vis other groups. Sixth, there is a tendency for the agent to
agree more with those in the same groups. As a microfoundation for our model,
we provide an explanation for why an overconfident agent might allow for
potential discrimination in evaluating outcomes, even when he initially did not
conceive of this possibility.

transport model, the isospin effect in peripheral heavy-ion collisions has been
investigated thoroughly. A coalescence approach is used for recognizing the
primary fragments formed in nucleus-nucleus collisions. The secondary decay
process of the fragments is described by the statistical code, GEMINI.
Production mechanism and isospin effect of the projectile-like and target-like
fragments are analyzed with the combined approach. It is found that the isospin
migration from the high-isospin density to the low-density matter takes place
in the neutron-rich nuclear reactions, i.e., $^{48}$Ca+$^{208}$Pb,
$^{86}$Kr+$^{48}$Ca/$^{208}$Pb/$^{124}$Sn, $^{136}$Xe+$^{208}$Pb,
$^{124}$Sn+$^{124}$Sn and $^{136}$Xe+$^{136}$Xe. A hard symmetry energy is
available for creating the neutron-rich fragments, in particular in the
medium-mass region. The isospin effect of the neutron to proton (n/p) ratio of
the complex fragments is reduced once including the secondary decay process.
However, a soft symmetry energy enhances the n/p ratio of the light particles,
in particular at the kinetic energies above 15 MeV/nucleon.

oceanic currents, particularly by eddies (vortices) formed by the hydrodynamic
flow field. Employing a kinematic flow field coupled to a population dynamical
model for plankton growth, we study the impact of an intermittent upwelling of
nutrients on triggering harmful algal blooms (HABs). Though it is widely
believed that additional nutrients boost the formation of HABs or algal blooms
in general, we show that the response of the plankton to nutrient plumes
depends crucially on the mesoscale hydrodynamic flow structure. In general
nutrients can either be quickly washed out from the observation area, or can be
captured by the vortices in the flow. The occurrence of either scenario depends
on the relation between the time scales of the vortex formation and nutrient
upwelling as well as the time instants at which upwelling pulse occurs and how
long do they last. We show that these two scenarios result in very different
responses in plankton dynamics which makes it very difficult to predict,
whether nutrient upwelling will lead to a HAB or not. This explains, why
observational data are sometimes inconclusive establishing a correlation
between upwelling events and plankton blooms.

  learning","Background: Building visual encoding models to accurately predict visual
responses is a central challenge for current vision-based brain-machine
interface techniques. To achieve high prediction accuracy on neural signals,
visual encoding models should include precise visual features and appropriate
prediction algorithms. Most existing visual encoding models employ hand-craft
visual features (e.g., Gabor wavelets or semantic labels) or data-driven
features (e.g., features extracted from deep neural networks (DNN)). They also
assume a linear mapping between feature representation to brain activity.
However, it remains unknown whether such linear mapping is sufficient for
maximizing prediction accuracy. New Method: We construct a new visual encoding
framework to predict cortical responses in a benchmark functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) dataset. In this framework, we employ the transfer
learning technique to incorporate a pre-trained DNN (i.e., AlexNet) and train a
nonlinear mapping from visual features to brain activity. This nonlinear
mapping replaces the conventional linear mapping and is supposed to improve
prediction accuracy on brain activity. Results: The proposed framework can
significantly predict responses of over 20% voxels in early visual areas (i.e.,
V1-lateral occipital region, LO) and achieve unprecedented prediction accuracy.
Comparison with Existing Methods: Comparing to two conventional visual encoding
models, we find that the proposed encoding model shows consistent higher
prediction accuracy in all early visual areas, especially in relatively
anterior visual areas (i.e., V4 and LO). Conclusions: Our work proposes a new
framework to utilize pre-trained visual features and train non-linear mappings
from visual features to brain activity.

environments. In the quantum regime, however, synchronisation is typically
observed by identifying an appropriate parameter regime in a specific system.
In this work we show that this need not be the case, identifying conditions
which, when satisfied, guarantee that the individual constituents of a generic
open quantum system will undergo completely synchronous limit cycles which are,
to first order, robust to symmetry-breaking perturbations. We then describe how
these conditions can be satisfied by the interplay between several elements:
interactions, local dephasing and the presence of a strong dynamical symmetry -
an operator which guarantees long-time non-stationary dynamics. These elements
cause the formation of entanglement and off-diagonal long-range order which
drive the synchronised response of the system. To illustrate these ideas we
present two central examples: a chain of quadratically dephased spin-1s and the
many-body charge-dephased Hubbard model. In both cases perfect phase-locking
occurs throughout the system, regardless of the specific microscopic parameters
or initial states. Furthermore, when these systems are perturbed, their
non-linear responses elicit long-lived signatures of both phase and
frequency-locking.

Roy's rigid systems. In particular, we compute the Hausdorff and packing

  radiatively efficient relativistic sources","The dissipation of turbulent magnetic fields is an appealing scenario to
explain the origin of non-thermal particles in high-energy astrophysical
sources. However, it has been suggested that the particle distribution may
effectively thermalise when the radiative (synchrotron and/or Inverse Compton)
losses are severe. Inspired by recent PIC simulations of relativistic
turbulence, which show that electrons are impulsively heated in intermittent
current sheets by a strong electric field aligned with the local magnetic
field, we instead argue that in plasmas where the particle number density is
dominated by the pairs (electron-positron and electron-positron-ion plasmas):
(i) as an effect of fast cooling and of different injection times, the electron
energy distribution is ${\rm d}n_e/{\rm d}\gamma\propto\gamma^{-2}$ for
$\gamma\lesssim\gamma_{\rm heat}$ (the Lorentz factor $\gamma_{\rm heat}$ being
close to the equipartition value), while the distribution steepens at higher
energies; (ii) since the time scales for the turbulent fields to decay and for
the photons to escape are of the same order, the magnetic and the radiation
energy densities in the dissipation region are comparable; (iii) if the mass
energy of the plasma is dominated by the ion component, the pairs with a
Lorentz factor smaller than a critical one (of the order of the
proton-to-electron mass ratio) become isotropic, while the pitch angle remains
small otherwise. The outlined scenario is consistent with the typical

  Asymmetric Hardware Distortion","Hardware non-idealities are among the main performance restrictions for
upcoming wireless communication systems. Asymmetric hardware distortions (HWD)
happen when the impairments of the I/Q branches are correlated or imbalanced,
which in turn generate improper additive interference at the receiver side.
When the interference is improper, as well as in other interference-limited
scenarios, improper Gaussian signaling (IGS) has been shown to provide rate
and/or power efficiency benefits. In this paper, we investigate the rate
benefits of IGS in a two-user interference channel (IC) with additive
asymmetric HWD when interference is treated as noise. We propose two iterative
algorithms to optimize the parameters of the improper transmit signals. We
first rewrite the rate region as an
pseudosignal-to-interference-plus-noise-ratio (PSINR) region and employ
majorization minimization and fractional programming to find a suboptimal
solution for the achievable user rates. Then, we propose a simplified algorithm
based on a separate optimization of the powers and complementary variances of
the users, which exhibits lower computational complexity. We show that IGS can
improve the performance of the two-user IC with additive HWD. Our proposed
algorithms outperform proper Gaussian signaling and competing IGS algorithms in
the literature that do not consider asymmetric HWD.

optimal when the goal is the final state reached. This enables learning

no obvious systematic residuals to this double-lens/single-source (2L1S) fit,
we find that $\chi^2$ can be significantly improved by adding either a third
lens (3L1S, $\Delta\chi^2=81$) or second source (2L2S, $\Delta\chi^2=65$) to
the lens-source geometry. After thorough investigation, we conclude that we
cannot decisively distinguish between these two scenarios and therefore focus
on the robustly-detected planet. However, given the possible presence of a
second planet, we investigate to what degree and with what probability such
additional planets may affect seemingly single-planet light curves. Our best
estimates for the properties of the lens star and the secure planet are: a host
mass $M\sim 0.25\,M_\odot$, system distance $D_L\sim 1\,$kpc and planet mass
$m_{p,1}= 8\,M_\oplus$ with projected separation $a_{1,\perp}=1.4\,$au.
However, there is a relatively bright $I=18.6$ (and also relatively blue) star
projected within $<50\,$mas of the lens, and if future high-resolution images
show that this is coincident with the lens, then it is possible that it is the
lens, in which case, the lens would be both more massive and more distant than
the best-estimated values above.

dimensional chiral SYK model of $N$ flavors of right-moving chiral Majorana
fermions with all-to-all random 4-fermion interactions. The interactions in
this model are exactly marginal, leading to an exact scaling symmetry. We show
the Schwinger-Dyson equation of this model in the large $N$ limit is exactly
solvable. In addition, we show this model is integrable for small $N\le6$ by
bosonization. Surprisingly, the two point function in the large $N$ limit has
exactly the same form as that for $N=4$, although the four point functions of
the two cases are quite different. The ground state entropy in the large $N$
limit is the same as that of $N$ free chiral Majorana fermions, leading to a
zero ground state entropy density. The OTOC of the model in the large $N$ limit
exhibits a non-trivial spacetime structure reminscent of that found by Gu and
Kitaev for generic SYK-like models. Specifically we find a Lyapunov regime
inside an asymmetric butterfly cone, which are signatures of quantum chaos, and
that the maximal velocity dependent Lyapunov exponent approaches the chaos
bound $2\pi/\beta$ as the interaction strength approaches its physical upper
bound. Finally, the model is integrable for (at least) $N\le6$ but chaotic in
the large $N$ limit, leading us to conjecture that there is a transition from

  thermoelectric power factor of complex materials: The case of Co-based
  half-Heuslers","Half-Heuslers, an emerging thermoelectric material group, has complex
bandstructures with multiple bands that can be aligned through band engineering
approaches, giving us an opportunity to improve their power factor. In this
work, going beyond the constant relaxation time approximation, we perform an
investigation of the benefits of band alignment in improving the thermoelectric
power factor under different density of states dependent scattering scenarios.
As a test case we consider the Co-based p-type half-Heuslers TiCoSb, NbCoSn and
ZrCoSb. First, using simplified effective mass models combined with Boltzmann
transport, we investigate the conditions of band alignment that are beneficial
to the thermoelectric power factor under three different carrier scattering
scenarios: i) the usual constant relaxation time approximation, ii) intra-band
scattering restricted to the current valley with the scattering rates
proportional to the density of states as dictated by Fermi's Golden Rule, and
iii) both intra- and inter-band scattering across all available valleys, with
the rates determined by the total density of states at the relevant energies.
We demonstrate that the band-alignment outcome differs significantly depending
on the scattering details. Next, using the density functional theory calculated
bandstructures of the half-Heuslers we study their power factor behavior under
strain induced band alignment. We show that strain can improve the power factor
of half-Heuslers, but the outcome heavily depends on the curvatures of the
bands involved, the specifics of the carrier scattering mechanisms, and the
initial band separation. Importantly, we also demonstrate that band alignment
is not always beneficial to the power factor.

  discs to star formation dynamical history","Many stars form in regions of enhanced stellar density, wherein the influence
of stellar neighbours can have a strong influence on a protoplanetary disc
(PPD) population. In particular, far ultraviolet (FUV) flux from massive stars
drives thermal winds from the outer edge of PPDs, accelerating disc
destruction. In this work, we present a novel technique for constraining the
dynamical history of a star forming environment using PPD properties in a
strongly FUV irradiated environment. Applying recent models for FUV induced
mass loss rates to the PPD population of Cygnus OB2, we constrain how long ago
primordial gas was expelled from the region; $ 0.5$ Myr ago if the Shakura &
Sunyaev $\alpha$-viscosity parameter is $\alpha = 10^{-2}$ (corresponding to a
viscous timescale of $\tau_\mathrm{visc} \approx 0.5$ Myr for a disc of scale
radius $40$ au around a $1\, M_\odot$ star). This value of $\alpha$ is
effectively an upper limit, since it assumes efficient extinction of FUV
photons throughout the embedded phase. With this gas expulsion timescale we are
able to produce a full dynamical model that fits kinematic and morphological
data as well as disc fractions. We suggest Cygnus OB2 was originally composed
of distinct massive clumps or filaments, each with a stellar mass $\sim 10^4 \,
M_\odot$. Finally we predict that in regions of efficient FUV induced mass
loss, disc mass $M_\mathrm{disc}$ as a function of stellar host mass
$m_\mathrm{star}$ follows a power law with $M_\mathrm{disc} \propto
m_\mathrm{star}^\beta$, where $\beta \gtrsim 2.7$ (depending on disc initial
conditions and FUV exposure). This is steeper than observed correlations in
regions of moderate FUV flux ($1 < \beta <1.9$), and offers a promising
diagnostic to establish the influence of external photoevaporation in a given
region.

proposed by the EuroPriSe certification scheme by adding usability criteria.
Our model is visually represented through a cube, called Usable Privacy Cube
(or UP Cube), where each of its three axes of variability captures,
respectively: rights of the data subjects, privacy principles, and usable
privacy criteria. We slightly reorganize the criteria of EuroPriSe to fit with
the UP Cube model, i.e., we show how EuroPriSe can be viewed as a combination
of only rights and principles, forming the two axes at the basis of our UP
Cube. In this way we also want to bring out two perspectives on privacy: that
of the data subjects and, respectively, that of the controllers/processors. We
define usable privacy criteria based on usability goals that we have extracted
from the whole text of the General Data Protection Regulation. The criteria are
designed to produce measurements of the level of usability with which the goals
are reached. Precisely, we measure effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction,
considering both the objective and the perceived usability outcomes, producing
measures of accuracy and completeness, of resource utilization (e.g., time,
effort, financial), and measures resulting from satisfaction scales. In the
long run, the UP Cube is meant to be the model behind a new certification
methodology capable of evaluating the usability of privacy, to the benefit of
common users. For industries, considering also the usability of privacy would
allow for greater business differentiation, beyond GDPR compliance.

  neutrino detection at the South Pole","The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) experiment at the South Pole is designed to
detect high-energy neutrinos which, via in-ice interactions, produce coherent
radiation at frequencies up to 1000 MHz. In Dec. 2018, a custom high-amplitude
radio-frequency transmitter was lowered into the 1700 m SPICE ice core to
provide test sources for ARA receiver stations sensitive to vertical and
horizontal polarizations. For these tests, signal geometries correspond to
obliquely propagating radio waves from below. The ARA collaboration has
recently measured the polarization-dependent time delay variation, and report
more significant time delays for trajectories perpendicular to ice flow. Here
we use fabric data from the SPICE ice core to construct a bounding model for
the ice birefringence and the polarization time delays across ARA. The
data-model comparison is consistent with the vertical girdle fabric at the
South Pole having the prevailing horizontal crystallographic axis oriented
near-perpendicular to ice flow. This study presents the possibility that ice
birefringence can be used to constrain the range to a neutrino interaction, and
hence aid in neutrino energy reconstruction, for in-ice experiments such as
ARA.

confirmed ultra-massive quiescent galaxies
(${\rm{log}}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot})\sim11.5$) at $z\gtrsim2$. This sample
comprises 15 galaxies selected in the COSMOS and UDS fields by their bright
K-band magnitudes and followed up with VLT/X-shooter spectroscopy and HST/WFC3
$H_{F160W}$ imaging. These observations allow us to unambiguously confirm their
redshifts ascertain their quiescent nature and stellar ages, and to reliably
assess their internal kinematics and effective radii. We find that these
galaxies are compact, consistent with the high mass end of the mass-size
relation for quiescent galaxies at $z=2$. Moreover, the distribution of the
measured stellar velocity dispersions of the sample is consistent with the most
massive local early-type galaxies from the MASSIVE Survey showing that
evolution in these galaxies, is dominated by changes in size. The HST images
reveal, as surprisingly high, that $40\ \%$ of the sample have tidal features
suggestive of mergers and companions in close proximity, including three
galaxies experiencing ongoing major mergers. The absence of velocity dispersion
evolution from $z=2$ to $0$, coupled with a doubling of the stellar mass, with
a factor of four size increase and the observed disturbed stellar morphologies
support dry minor mergers as the primary drivers of the evolution of the
massive quiescent galaxies over the last 10 billion years.

computers. As an essential step towards the implementation of quantum
error-correcting codes, quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements are needed to
efficiently detect the state of a logical qubit without destroying it. Here we
implement QND measurements in a Si/SiGe two-qubit system, with one qubit
serving as the logical qubit and the other serving as the ancilla. Making use
of a two-qubit controlled-rotation gate, the state of the logical qubit is
mapped onto the ancilla, followed by a destructive readout of the ancilla.
Repeating this procedure enhances the logical readout fidelity from $75.5\pm
0.3\%$ to $94.5 \pm 0.2\%$ after 15 ancilla readouts. In addition, we compare
the conventional thresholding method with an improved signal processing method
called soft decoding that makes use of analog information in the readout signal
to better estimate the state of the logical qubit. We demonstrate that soft
decoding leads to a significant reduction in the required number of repetitions
when the readout errors become limited by Gaussian noise, for instance in the
case of readouts with a low signal-to-noise ratio. These results pave the way
for the implementation of quantum error correction with spin qubits in silicon.

equal to the geometric mean of the DGP cross-over scale and the separation of
the two branes in the extra dimension. For distances, which are larger than

where a 4-dimensional observer measures a distance independent force. We

curves of low surface brightness galaxies. Using the Kaluza-Klein description,

attractive and repulsive parts of the gravitational potential, respectively.
Finally, since this setup allows for the existence of a sector of particle
species that are interacting arbitrarily weakly with ""our"" sector, we discuss

transfer (PGST), which is of interest for high-fidelity transfer of information
in quantum computing. Realizations of PGST networks have so far mostly relied
either on very special network geometries or imposed conditions such as
transcendental on-site potentials. However, it was recently shown [Eisenberg et
al., arXiv:1804.01645] that PGST generally arises when a network's eigenvectors
and the factors $P_{\pm}$ of its characteristic polynomial $P$ fulfill certain
conditions, where $P_{\pm}$ correspond to eigenvectors which have $\pm 1$
parity on the input and target sites. We combine this result with the so-called
isospectral reduction of a network to obtain $P_{\pm}$ from a dimensionally
reduced form of the Hamiltonian. Equipped with the knowledge of the factors
$P_{\pm}$, we show how a variety of setups can be equipped with PGST by proper
tuning of $P_{\pm}$. Having demonstrated a method of designing networks
featuring pretty good state transfer of single site excitations, we further
show how the obtained networks can be manipulated such that they allow for
robust storage of qubits. We hereby rely on the concept of compact localized
states, which are eigenstates of a Hamiltonian localized on a small subdomain,
and whose amplitudes completely vanish outside of this domain. Such states are
natural candidates for the storage of quantum information, and we show how
certain Hamiltonians featuring pretty good state transfer of single site
excitation can be equipped with compact localized states such that their
transfer is made possible.
