Children’s exposure
to sexually explicit
content: Parents’
awareness, attitudes
and actions
PREPARED BY DR EDGAR PACHECO AND
NEIL MELHUISH

What is this about?
This report presents findings from a larger
quantitative study about parenting, digital
technologies and online risks. It focuses on
parents and caregivers’ awareness and
attitudes regarding their child’s exposure to
sexually explicit content online. The study was
conducted in New Zealand based on a
nationally representative sample.
Through this report, Netsafe seeks to provide
the online safety community and public with
research-based evidence regarding the extent
and impact of online risks and harm. Children
and young people have been a key part of our
research agenda since becoming the
Approved Agency under the Harmful Digital
Communications Act 2015, leading to the
publication of reports on teens’ online sharing
of nudes, and the emotional and behavioural
impact of unwanted digital communication on
young people (see Netsafe, 2017, 2018c).
While digital technologies offer young people
opportunities – such as entertainment,
socialising, and learning (Netsafe, 2018a) – the

Summary of findings
• Parents’ main online concerns are their
children sharing nudes of themselves,
being treated in a hurtful way, and seeing
sexually explicit content.
• 1 in 5 parents said their children were
exposed to sexually explicit content online
in the prior year.
• Parents reported children’s exposure to
sexually explicit content increased with
age; and exposure to sexually explicit
content was more common among boys.
• The main reasons parents gave for their
child’s exposure to this content were: it
popped up on the screen/device, curiosity,
and accidental access.
• 39% of parents said they stayed calm after
finding their children were exposed to
sexually explicit content while 22% were
angry, and 10% ignored the situation.
• Most parents believe they know what to do
and say if their children access or are
exposed to sexually explicit content.
• After a situation occurred, most parents
(72%) talked with their children about
sexually explicit content on the internet.
• Most parents are confident talking with
their children about pornography, while 2
in 10 feel embarrassed. Over half said they
discuss sex education and sexuality with
their children, while 3 in 10 do not.
• Half of parents know where to access
information and resources about children
and pornography, while 4 in 10 do not.

potential for them to be exposed to sexually
explicit content online is a matter of concern.
For Netsafe understanding this phenomenon
is of interest due to the risks and potential
harm it involves. Recently, New Zealand-based
research has concentrated on the exposure
and consumption of pornographic material
among adolescents (see Office of Film and
Literature Classification, 2018). Our study
complements these efforts by exploring
parents’ level of awareness and attitudes
regarding children’s exposure to sexual
content online.
Parents are key players in relation to the
online safety of their children. However, while
evidence shows that New Zealand teens
regard their parents as the first line of support
in dealing with online risks and challenges
(see Netsafe, 2018b), parents seem to
underestimate or be unaware of the frequency
of such risks (Byrne, Katz, Lee, Linz, & McIlrath,
2014; Livingstone, Haddon, Görzig, & Ólafsson,
2011). What is more, little is still known about
parents’ behaviours and actions when their
children have been exposed to online risks
(Rothman, Paruk, Espensen, Temple, & Adams,
2017). This study seeks to address the gap in
New Zealand. By exploring parents’ attitudes
and behaviours, Netsafe believes this report
makes a useful contribution to the
understanding of digital parenting in New
Zealand. It can inform service delivery and
support parents’ efforts towards fostering a
positive online experience as part of their
children’s healthy development.

What we know so far
A significant body of international research has
explored children and adolescents’ exposure
to sexually explicit content, especially
pornographic material. Reviews of available
empirical research have been conducted in
recent years (see Owens, Behun, Manning, &
Reid, 2012; Peter & Valkenburg, 2016; Short,
Black, Smith, Wetterneck, & Wells, 2012).
Overall, these reviews found that measures of
children and adolescents’ exposure to and use
of pornography differ among studies, and that
evidence regarding the impact of sexually

explicit content on minors is inconclusive
(Peter & Valkenburg, 2016). The last point is a
matter of current academic debate (see
Campbell, 2016; Dines, 2018; Flood, 2009;
Horvath et al., 2013; Lim, Carrotte, & Hellard,
2016; Livingstone, 2017; McCormack & Wignall,
2017). Contrasting evidence about exposure to
and the impact of sexually explicit content on
young people might be due, in part, to
differences in methodological approaches
applied and philosophical assumptions about
the topic.
In New Zealand, a recent study published by
the Office of Film and Literature Classification
(2018) found that about two thirds of teenagers
aged 14 to 17 years old have been exposed to
pornography at some point in their lives. The
study defines pornography as “explicit images,
video, or movies of a person or people having
real sex or doing sexual things and you can
see their genitals (e.g. penis, vagina).” (Office
of Film and Literature Classification, 2018, p.
16). It also found that 1 in 4 teens first saw
pornographic content before the age of 12 and
that 71% were not seeking pornography when
they saw it for the first time. In terms of
gender, the study found that access to this
material was more common among male
teenagers (75%) than females (58%) (Office of
Film and Literature Classification, 2018).
In addition, parents’ awareness and
behaviours about children and teens’
exposure to sexually explicit content have
received some research attention. A study on
9 to 16-year-olds from 25 European countries
(see Livingstone et al., 2011) found that 40% of
parents of children who reported to have seen
sexually explicit content indicated that their
children did not experience it. Meanwhile, 35%
were aware of their child’s experience, and
26% said they did not know whether their child
had been exposed. A US-based study (see
Byrne et al., 2014), on the other hand, found
that parents tend to underestimate children’s
accidental exposure to sexually explicit
content. Also, when parents find out that their
child has seen such content their reactions
tend to be: a) angry, shaming, or punitive; b)
calm and factual; c) ignoring, minimising, or
2

denying that it happened; d) panic or fear; and
e) lying about the incident (see Rothman et al.,
2017).
Some of the actions usually taken by parents
to keep children safe online include
communicating with them, restricting and
monitoring their internet use, as well as using
filtering/blocking software (Anderson, 2016;
Livingstone et al., 2011). A recent Australiabased study 1 found that most parents (61%)
talked with their child after finding out the
pornographic content was accessed. Less
common actions were to monitor internet use
(29%), and install internet filters (20%). In New
Zealand, research on parents’ attitudes and
actions regarding this topic has received little
attention with efforts mainly focused on
children’s personally reported experiences,
through a range of media (Broadcasting
Standards Authority & NZ On Air, 2015; Office
of Film and Literature Classification, 2018). This
study seeks to close the gap by providing
quantitative evidence about parents’
awareness, attitudes, and actions about their
children’s exposure to sexually explicit
content.

What we did
We conducted a quantitative survey with
parents/whānau (and caregivers) of children
aged 9 to 17 years old. The survey was
informed by the Global Kids Online2 (GKON)
framework and other prior research on the
topic (Rothman et al., 2017; Zurcher, 2017). We
also sought feedback from relevant
stakeholders to improve the questionnaire.
Our intention was to gather statistical insights
about parents’ awareness and attitudes
towards their child’s access and exposure to
sexually explicit content, both deliberately
and/or accidentally, in the prior year. Our
working definition of sexually explicit content
was:

Any online content (e.g. pictures, photos,
videos) that is sexually explicit, for instance
material showing people naked, partially
naked in a sexually suggestive situation
and/or people having sex.
This definition includes mainstream
pornography but was not limited to it. We
sought participation of parents most involved
in their child’s online experiences. Where
there was more than one child in the age
group in the household, we asked parents to
answer the survey with only one of their
children in mind. Fieldwork took place during
August and September 2018. The survey,
which was administered by Colmar Brunton,
collected representative data in terms of
gender, age, ethnicity, and location.
A total of 2061 parents participated in the
study. The margins of error are ±2.2% at 95%
confidence for the whole sample, and a
maximum of ±6.6% for specific sub-groups. We
provided parents with information about the
study and asked for their consent to
participate, assuring them that their data will
be kept confidential. We acknowledge that
any measure based on self-reported data is an
inherent limitation.
Note that percentages in figures and tables
may not total exactly 100% due to rounding or
because survey participants were allowed to
choose multiple answers to some questions.

What we found
This section describes the main findings from
our survey. These findings are presented
according to the six-question module we
developed for the study.
PARENTS’ MAIN ONLINE SAFETY
CONCERNS
The first question asked all parents about the
main concerns they had regarding the online
safety of their child. As Table 1 shows, the
main concerns pointed out by parents were:

their child sharing nudes of themselves (59%),
being treated in a hurtful way (51%) and seeing
sexually explicit content (49%). Note that
participants could choose multiple responses.

Base: All respondents (2061).

When asked which of these risks they would
be most concerned about, parents indicated
sharing of nudes (19%). This finding might
reflect, to some degree, the way media outlets
report stories regarding the pervasiveness of
“sexting” among teenagers. However, as a
Netsafe (2017) study shows, while there is
pressure to share nudes, only a small
proportion (4%) of New Zealand teens (aged 14
to 17 years old) has engaged in this activity.
Parents’ concerns varied according to the age
of their child. For example, worries about
seeing sexual images or videos of someone
naked were higher among parents of 9 to 11year-old children. In contrast, parents of 15- to
17-year-olds were significantly less concerned
about this situation. On the other hand,
parents of 15-year-olds rated lower the sharing

of nudes compared to parents of other age
groups.
Also, compared to parents of younger children
(aged 9-11), parents of older children –
especially those aged 16 years old – were
more concerned about their kids treating
someone else in a hurtful or nasty way online.
We found a similar pattern regarding privacy.
Parents of older children, especially those
aged 17 years old, were more worried about
their children having their personal data
accessed or misused by someone else. In
contrast, parents of younger children,
especially those aged 9 and 10 years old,
rated this issue lower. On the other hand,
parents of 13- and 14-year-olds expressed
more concern about their child meeting faceto-face with someone they first got to know on
the internet.
A look at the data regarding children’s gender
revealed that girls’ parents were more
concerned than parents of boys about them
sharing nude images or videos of themselves
with others. Meanwhile, boys’ parents were
more worried than those of girls about their
children treating someone else in a hurtful or
nasty way online and spending excessive time
on the internet. Differences regarding other
online safety issues related to gender were
not significant.
When looking at children’s ethnicity some
differences were also found among survey
respondents. For instance, parents of NZ
European/Pākehā, Māori, and Pacific children
were significantly more worried about their
children sharing nudes of themselves. On the
other hand, having contact with a stranger
online was consistently rated highly as a
concern by parents of all ethnicities except
those of European/Pākehā children. On the
other hand, it was more common for parents of
Asian children to be worried about their child
spending excessive time on the internet.

Next, we asked parents whether they were
aware of any exposure of their child to
sexually explicit content online in the prior
year. Over half of parents (54%) said “no” while
19% responded affirmatively to the question.
About a quarter of parents (27%) were not sure
whether their child was exposed to sexually
explicit content – see Figure 1 for details.

The levels of children’s exposure to sexually
explicit content reported by parents steadily
increases with age. For example, 10% of
parents whose child was aged 9 years old
reported being aware their child was exposed
to sexual content online in the prior year. The
figures gradually increased to 26% among
parents of teens aged 17 years old. Details are
presented in Figure 2. Note that the labels ‘not
sure’ and ‘prefer not to say’ are not included to
facilitate graphical interpretation of exposure
to sexually explicit content findings.

sexually explicit content by children’s age

Differences regarding the ethnicity of the
children were not statistically significant in our
data. However, there was a difference in
parents’ awareness of exposure in relation to
their child’s gender. According to parents,
boys seemed to be more commonly exposed
to sexually explicit content than girls. In this
respect, reports about exposure were higher
among parents of male children (22%)
compared to those of female children (16%).

PARENTS’ FIRST REACTIONS TO
CHILDREN’S EXPOSURE

parents of 13-year-old children and under (an
overall 30%) except for children aged 9 years.

Through a follow-up question, we also wanted
to know what the first reaction of parents was
when they found out their child was exposed
to sexually explicit content (Figure 4). Of those
382 parents, 39% indicated that they stayed
calm. A different reaction was described by
22% of respondents who said they were angry
or upset about what happened. The third most
common reaction was to ignore the situation
(10%). It was also interesting that blaming the
child for the situation was rare among parents,
with only 1% saying they shamed or punished
them.

Also, the rate of parents of Māori children who
indicated being angry or upset with the
exposure situation was higher compared to
the responses from parents of children from
other ethnicities.

I was calm

A closer look at the data regarding children’s
gender also reveals some interesting insights.
Parents of girls (31%), for example, were
significantly angrier/more upset about their
children’s exposure to sexually explicit content
compared to parents of boys (19%). Also,
staying calm was a more common first reaction
among parents of boys (43%) than parents of
girls (34%). See Figure 5 for further details.

PERCEPTIONS OF CHILDREN’S
REASONS FOR EXPOSURE TO SEXUALLY
EXPLICIT CONTENT
We sought to capture parents’ perceived
reasons for their child’s exposure to sexually
explicit content. We presented to them a list of
potential explanations and allowed them to
choose one or more reasons. According to
parents the three top reasons explaining their
kid’s exposure to the content were: sexual
content popped up on the screen or device
(32%), curiosity (30%), and content was
accessed by accident (24%). Further details
are given in Table 2.

perception that children were exposed to
content because they were seeking sexual
arousal/stimulation was higher among parents
of NZ European/Pākehā.
On the other hand, parents’ perceptions of
why their children were exposed to content
varied in terms of the child’s gender (see Table
3). For example, 42% of girls’ parents thought
that content had popped up on the screen and
30% that it was accidentally accessed. In
contrast, boys’ parents’ rates of these two
reasons were significantly lower: 25% and
20%, respectively.
It was more common for parents of boys to
indicate that their child sought out sexually
explicit content out of curiosity (37%)
compared to those of girls (20%). Boys’
parents also rated higher other reasons such
as seeking sexual arousal, entertainment, and
someone else sharing content with the child.

PARENTS’ ACTIONS REGARDING THEIR
CHILDREN’S EXPOSURE
Parents usually take some action in response
to learning that their child has been exposed
to sexually explicit content. We asked them
about these actions to manage their children’s
accidental or intentional exposure to this sort
of content.
The most common action adopted by parents
was to talk to their child about the content
they saw online (72%). Less frequent but still
relevant was to monitor their child’s use of
devices and the internet (21%), and restricting
access through filtering or blocking software
(21%). Also, 1 in 10 parents indicated they took
no action. See Table 4.

Parents of 13-year-olds were also more likely
to talk with their child about sexually explicit
content online than parents with children from
other age sub-groups. Finally, parents of 17year-olds were more likely to not to take any
action to address their child’s exposure to
sexually explicit content.
PARENTS’ CONFIDENCE IN MANAGING
RELATED ISSUES
In general, parents expressed high levels of
confidence on issues related to their children's
exposure to sexually explicit content.
More than 7 in 10 parents (72%) said they know
what to do if their children see or are exposed
to sexually explicit content while 17%
responded negatively. Nearly 8 in 10 parents
(78%) indicated that they know what to say to
their children if a situation of exposure to
sexual content happens. Over half of parents
said they discuss sex education and sexuality
with their children, while 3 in 10 do not.

On the other hand, regarding the child’s age, it
was more common for parents of 12-year-olds
to limit their time online. The use of filtering or

We also included a couple of statements about
“pornography”. While most parents (70%) said
they are confident talking with their children
about pornography, 2 in 10 reported feeling
embarrassed.
While half of parents believed they know
where to access parental information and
resources about children and pornography, 4
in 10 do not.
Also, parents with children 13 and over were
more likely to say yes to: knowing what to do if
their child sees sexually explicit content (75%,
compared to 70% of parents with children 12
and under), know what to say to their child if
they see explicit content (80%, compared to
75%), having open discussions about sex with
their child (69%, compared to 55%) and
knowing where to access information about
children and pornography (56%, compared to
46%).
Meanwhile, fathers were less likely than
mothers to feel comfortable talking with their
child about pornography (66% no, compared
to 73% of mothers) or to have open
conversations about sex with their child (56%
yes, compared to 66% of mothers). Asian
parents are less likely to know what to do
(24%) or say (22%) to their child if they are
exposed to sexually explicit content and less
likely to have open conversations about sex
with their child (43%).

Concluding remarks
This summary report has presented findings
from a representative survey on parents’
awareness and attitudes towards children’s
exposure to sexually explicit content.
Our findings describe that parents are
generally more concerned about the risks
associated with sex-related online behaviours
of their children than other types of risk. Issues
such as the sharing of nudes and exposure to
sexually explicit content are among the top
three parental concerns in New Zealand. As

3

previously described, these findings might
reflect the impact of current news media
coverage and public discourse on New
Zealand parents’ views. However, it is not yet
clear whether there is any other contextual
factor influencing parents’ concerns about the
risks of sex-related online behaviours of their
children.
The study also offers valuable insights about
parents’ awareness of their child’s exposure to
sexually explicit content. As previously
reported, 19% said their child has seen this
type of material in the prior year. Compared
with a similar Australian study3, New Zealand
parents report a lower level of awareness
about exposure. Another interesting finding
relates to parents reporting that overall their
child’s exposure was more often accidental
than intentional.
However, the level of parents’ awareness in
comparison with their child’s actual exposure
to sexually explicit content is still unknown in
New Zealand. This is mainly because of the
methodological and ethical issues around the
sensitivity of the topic and collecting data from
younger children.
Nevertheless, and interestingly, there are
some indications of disparity among parents’
level of awareness and teenagers’ selfreported exposure to sexually explicit content
in the New Zealand context. When looking at a
specific age group, our data show that around
25% of parents of teens aged 14 to 17 years
old indicated awareness of their child’s
exposure in the last 12 months (see Figure 2).
However, the recent representative study
conducted by the Office of Film and Literature
Classification (2018) shows that over two thirds
of teens (67%) of the same age range said they
have seen pornography at some point in their
lives, and 27% in the last 6 months. While the
literature has already highlighted parents’
apparent underestimation and/or unawareness
of children’s experiences of online risks (Byrne

The study conducted by the Office of the eSafety Commissioner found 24% of Australian parents were aware of their child’s exposure to
pornography, 67% said their child did not see such content, and 7% indicated they did not know. See https://www.esafety.gov.au/research

results together are surprising and call for
further exploration of the topic.

the topic and the online safety of their children
in general.

Once parents became aware that their child
had been exposed to sexually explicit content,
most (72%) talked with them about the
situation. This finding indicates parents’
preference for actively mediating their
children’s internet experience over restrictive
and technical actions such as content blocking
(Livingstone et al., 2011). This finding is
accompanied by the significant level of
confidence parents have regarding what to do
and say to their child after the event. However,
while a parental response that promotes open
communication can have positive outcomes
for children (see Netsafe, 2018b), we still know
little about the quality of these sexuallyexplicit-content-related conversations and the
information parents shared with their child.

What’s next?

Our findings also suggest that more needs to
be done to enhance digital parenting in New
Zealand. There are still significant numbers of
parents who feel embarrassed talking about
pornography or struggle having an open
conversation about sex with their child.
Parents’ need for information and resources
about children and pornography is even more
apparent in our data. Prior research suggests
that there are barriers preventing some
parents addressing issues related to exposure
to sexually explicit content: limited sexual
health knowledge, believing adolescents are
not ready to discuss sex, discomfort discussing
sex, and demographic factors (Malacane &
Beckmeyer, 2016). Whether these and other
barriers play a role among New Zealand
parents is a matter for future research.
Clearly, the findings of this study have
implications for digital parenting in New
Zealand. We believe that they not only
complement the growing body of knowledge
about pornography and children but also
contribute to the understanding of the role
played by New Zealand parents in regard to

This summary report is the first instalment from
a larger research project. In the upcoming
months Netsafe will release findings from its
study on New Zealand children and
adolescents’ access to and use of digital
technologies as well as experiences of online
risks. The study is part of Netsafe’s work as a
member of Global Kids Online, an international
research network which seeks to generate
and sustain rigorous cross-national evidence
about children’s engagement with their online
environment.
Also, we have released a joint report with
comparison of findings about exposure to
sexually explicit content in the UK, Australia
and New Zealand4. This report is the result of
an international partnership between the UK
Safer Internet Centre, the Australian Office of
the eSafety Commissioner, and Netsafe.
