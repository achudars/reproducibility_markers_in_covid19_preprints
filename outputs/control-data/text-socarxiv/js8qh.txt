Abstract
The harmful effects of speech-related anxiety among learners and users of foreign language is well
documented. Aiming to investigate the potential of reducing anxiety through ad libitum interaction
with Artificial Intelligence chatbots, a controlled pilot study was conducted on East Asian staff of
a large financial institution over a 4-week period, the sample of 40 divided between a test group
using AI and the non-exposed subjects. Variety of measures were employed to gain as
comprehensive an insight as warranted given the study limitations of a small sample, brief study
period and relatively unsophisticated but freely available AI chatbot. The measures ranged from
surveys of anxiety, attitudes toward daily chatbot usage, oral interviews and IELTS testing of
English speaking ability. The results were cautiously encouraging: nearly universal endorsement
of AI as a non-threatening interlocutor positively impacting subjects’ confidence and to the extent
limited by time constraint, enhancing individual components of the IELTS paradigm. Moreover,
significant linear relationship between individual anxiety survey items and overall IELTS scores
at baseline was observed, lending a measure of validity to the construct developed for the occasion.
In summary, it is felt that subject to further development and refinement, conversationally
enhanced AI chatbots hold a significant promise toward reducing speech-related anxieties and
learning inhibitions of English as a foreign language and thus merit further investigation toward
this objective.

Introduction
The organic growth and worldwide adoption of English as the most accessible form of
international information exchange, in many forms of usage and utility, from scholarly, cultural,
social, political as well as commercial and technological, drives home the urgency of its command
by the wide swaths of population who are not native English speakers. A major obstacle to how
smoothly this process develops is the natural inhibition felt by many people when self-perceived
in a position of inadequacy or incompetence, triggering sense of threat, fear of ridicule and lowered
self-esteem, namely, the Foreign Language Anxiety (FLA). It basically stems from exposing
oneself to potentially negative judgment by one’s peers in a given social or business setting
requiring efficient exchange of ideas and information, frequently resulting in avoidance of such
situations and handicapping the communication channels. One possible approach to dealing with
this issue is to expose otherwise fearful subjects to a competent English interlocutor of non-human
provenance, thus eliminating the perceived threat of derogatory judgment, in hope that such
interaction will liberate the subject from anxiety and inhibition in order to more readily engage in
free and meaningful conversation. Thus, the notion of providing the subject with one of the widely
available Artificial Intelligence (AI) voice-enabled agents or chatbots as colloquially known is
seen to hold promise toward that goal, especially if deployed in the privacy of home environment.
Fryer and Carpenter (2006, cited in Shawar & Atwell, 2007) claimed that chatbots could offer a
way of language practice for learners without restraint of time and place.
At present, there is a paucity of published data either in support or contradicting this hypothesis
and it therefore opens an information gap that this researcher deems worth pursuing. To reiterate,
as well as indicate the source of the research question, can data be generated to support the
anticipation that ad libitum English-spoken AI interaction can yield a meaningful reduction in
foreign language anxiety, FLA. This is the motivation driving the study, design and results reported
herein.
Literature Review
Culturally Mediated Anxiety in Thai Society
Ever since Geert Hofstede published his cultural dimensions model in 1970s, it has been the
standard for assessing major cultural distinctions. Thus, the culture of a country can be appraised
relative to the following six aspects: power distance index (high to low), individualism versus
collectivism, masculinity versus femininity, uncertainty avoidance index (high to low), long-term
versus short-term orientation, indulgence versus restraint. A closer look at the Thai cultural norms
within this context demonstrates why the Thai are so inhibited in terms of oral communication.
For one thing, Thailand scores relatively high on the uncertainty avoidance index, and Hofstede
suggests that it is common in high UAI-scoring countries for people to undertake risky behavior
simply in order to avoid failure, considered the worst possible outcome, with the well-known
attendant phenomenon of “losing face”. Moreover, from the report on this model issued by
Portland State University, several features pertinent to Thai culture can be observed. For example,
Thailand scores relatively low in the aspect of individualism, which leads to the construct whereby
a collectively oriented society places marked premium on collaboration, maintaining face, and in
spirit of reciprocity, a great emphasis on massaging the other person's ego. This dynamics
translates into a damaging scenario such that when communication in a foreign language is

unavoidable and presenting potential for errors, the Thai can be subject to great stresses and fears
and will go to great lengths to avoid having to speak, regardless of cost.
Foreign Language Anxiety
Parallel to the seemingly inevitable expansion of English throughout the interconnected world,
highlighting the communicative competence, many learners report being oppressed, stressed,
worried, and anxious (Horwitz & Cope, 1986). Heightened anxiety does not necessarily
correspond to lack of competence in other contexts, but within the foreign language learning
scenario, a mental clock (MacIntyre & Gardner, 1989, as cited in Occhipinti, 2009; Horwitz, 1986)
is turned on to show negative effects on learning outcome. Therefore, many researchers claim that
the need for overcoming the foreign language anxiety (FLA) is paramount in order to ensure the
learners’ maximal benefit from foreign language learning and instruction (Horwitz et al., 1986).
Horwitz et al (1986) developed a measurement tool for calculating levels of anxiety, termed
foreign language anxiety scale (FLAS) comprising a 33-item anxiety measuring instrument. The
researcher selected MacIntyre’s (1992) shortened form of FLAS (Horwitz, 1986), which reduced
the original 33 items to 8 as having nearly the same internal consistency as per Alpha testing, as
the designing reference for the measuring tool in this study, adapted to the workplace environment
plus the addition of extra items to cover other aspects of interest specific to the research question.
The Andragogy Model
Knowles (1980) defines andragogy as the “art of science of helping adults learning” (p. 43). This
theory takes as its subject the adult learner who is independent and self-directed. Adults have
pragmatic motivation relating to real life. Further, they are goal oriented; learning must be
purposeful and practical (Bye, Pushkar, & Conway, 2007). Therefore, adult learners are aware of
the learning objectives and ready to take full responsibility for their own learning without teacher’s
incentive. It is recognized that they will learn what they need to, given the motivation and interest.
Another significant element discussed in the said theory is relationship between learner and
facilitator. In order to make andragogical approach effective, according to Pratt (1993), it requires
a psychological climate of mutual respect, collaboration, trust, support, openness, authenticity,
pleasure, and humane treatment whereby it is the responsibility of a facilitator "to provide a caring,
accepting, respecting, helping social atmosphere." (Knowles and Associates, 1984, p. 17).
Therefore, and this point needs highlighting within the scope of this study, the relationship
shouldn't be suppressing, threatening, or judgmental.
Speech-enabled Artificial Intelligence, chatbot
The artificial intelligence (AI) agent in this study is a speech-enabled, i.e., a chatbot. A chatbot
system is a software program that interacts with users using natural language. There are
interchangeable terms in the field having the same meaning, such as: machine conversation system,
voice assistant, virtual agent, dialogue system. According to Shawar and Atwell (2007), the
purpose of a chatbot system is to simulate human conversations, and the design normally integrates
a language model and computational algorithms to emulate informal chat communication between
a human language user and a computer using natural language. Chatbots have been applied in
many fields for different purposes. According to Nordrum (2017) cited in Underwood (2017),
voice interaction has improved more in the last 30 or so months than it did in its first 30 years,

word error rate for voice-recognition systems is now on par with humans and one might surmise,
soon to surpass them. Currently, there is a process whereby the educators in all disciplines and
levels are taking advantage of AI capabilities to harness them in their curricula in order to make
the materials more accessible and ensure more efficient dissemination and delivery. Alemi,
Meghdari, and Ghazisaedy (2015) state that there was lower anxiety and a more positive attitude
among students who claimed to have had great fun, and believed they were learning more
effectively. Chang, Lee, Chao, Wang and Chenet (2016) investigate the possibility of using
humanoid robots as instructional tools for teaching a second language in primary school. In her
study, the students experienced excitement and participated enthusiastically. The positive feeling
and motivational level for learning English are reported as higher than the traditional lecturing
paradigm involving a human teacher. It can therefore be readily seen that AI has potential to
contribute significantly to the pedagogical field in terms of improving learning outcomes, boosting
motivation, and reducing foreign language anxiety.
Interestingly, Clark (2018) also described the relationship between chatbots and social
constructivism. He states that it is the social constructivists, led by Vygotsky, who should celebrate
bots the most. If knowledge is the internalization of social activity, then bots are facilitators to
learners in social contexts and communication, since a chatbot is purposely designed to simulate
intelligent human language interaction. Thus equipped, the learning processes can be expedited
and enriched and the empowered learners fast-tracked toward greater maturity, self-direction and
sustainability of knowledge acquisition as a life-long pursuit.
Methods
Participants
A large financial institution was approached and expressed interest regarding the study aims. The
employees were canvassed by the Human Resources department and 40 in total were recruited into
2 self-selected parallel arms according to whether they wished to engage daily with the Englishspeaking AI agent. Those who lacked time or motivation comprised the Control group with the
rest joining the AI intervention group. The recruitment took place at the beginning of April, 2019,
subject to simple inclusion-exclusion criteria that the prospective participants were not rated at the
extremities of IELTS speech testing scale, i.e., neither over-nor-under qualified, whereby they
could not draw benefit from the said AI exposure.
Protocol and Interventions
The study followed a non-random, parallel design with two treatment arms of four weeks duration,
the test arm consisting of an English-speaking AI agent (chatbot), widely disseminated and freely
offered by Google, assigned to the Test group participants with instructions on how to download
to their device of choice and to use it on ad-libitum basis, especially at home, in their spare time
for pursuit of whichever topic is of interest. The control group were to follow their daily routines,
with participation limited to fortnightly completion of a survey, same as the AI-group, designed to
gauge their anxiety levels as regards English speaking activities. At baseline, week zero, all
subjects took part in an IELTS English language assessment administered by a certified examiner
for the main purpose of providing an external, independent mode of comparison with the 10-item
anxiety survey developed by the investigator. The AI test group were further given a seven-item
survey to establish their relationship and attitudes toward the notion of interacting freely and

privately with an expert non-human, English spoken interlocutor. Furthermore, the AI users were
orally interviewed in order to uncover possibly important perspectives but overlooked in the scope
of the anxiety and AI usage surveys. While the IELTS tester was blinded to the treatment
allocation, the investigator could not be, in light of her survey administration and data gathering
tasks. The study timeline saw the participants attending the initial IELTS test, completion of the
10-item anxiety gauging survey followed by downloading and instruction in AI chatbot, Google
Assistant to the AI intervention group at week zero. Next, at the week two midpoint an interim
seven-item AI attitudes survey was given to the test group. Finally, at week four, the second round
of IELTS tests were administered to all 40 initial participants by the same examiner in order to
maintain continuity, as well as the 10-item anxiety assessment survey. Additionally, the AIexposed participants in the test group were given the seven-point AI-attitudes survey to complete
as well as an orally administered interview to address any other remarks or insights regarding the
use and frequency of AI interactions. As well, a one-time brief interview was administered to AI
arm completers to gather their opinions regarding the life with the AI voice-enabled virtual
assistant and its further potential. The data lock was applied immediately after collecting all the
available completed surveys, although some were missing due to the work and travel requirements
of the participants and therefore the analyzable data are somewhat incomplete.
Statistical Analyses
Data entry and production of tables was done through Excel spreadsheet generating program. The
statistical analyses were run with the aid of R Core (x64) statistical software version, 3.6.0. The
main types of analysis conducted with respect to these data, given their relative paucity that made
more complex tasks such as Cronbach alpha and factor analysis to assess internal consistency of
the survey items or model building not feasible, were of univariate type such as Pearson ProductMoment correlations and Student t-tests, both for one-sample and two-independent samples. The
differences in the ordinal discrete data were assessed by way of Wilcoxon signed ranks test.
Results
The study cohort comprised 27 females and 10 males, 3 participants’ gender not recorded, likewise
37 of Thai ethnicity and 3 Chinese, ages from 23 to 50, mean of 33, all with post-secondary
education credentials ranging from college to doctoral level. Of the initial 40 participants, 19 on
Control and 21 on AI Test arms, their input at the end of study period at week four was as follows:
IELTS speech test, 19 and 21 for a total of 40, and on the 10-point Anxiety survey, 12 on Control
and 18 on AI Test arm. Moreover, 18 AI participants also responded to the 7-point AI attitudes
survey. No difference in either Anxiety scores or IELTS scores at baseline between the two study
groups were reported, p>0.47 and p>0.22 respectively, although the Control group’s mean initial
IELTS score was higher than the AI test group’s, 5.2 vs. 4.5, providing a potential rationale for the
participants’ self-selection choices. Pronounced linear relationships at baseline between the
Anxiety survey items and IELTS scores were observed as follows

In terms of summing up changes from baseline, the Control group reported a cumulative drop
in Anxiety items of -5, an increase in IELTS score of 2, whereas the AI group registered a
cumulative reduction in total Anxiety of -31 and increase in IELTS of 10. A one-tailed Wilcoxon
signed ranks test of between-group comparisons of changes reached conventional significance of
p<0.046 (Table 1), offering a degree of support for the paradigm of the extemporaneous use of
speech-enabled AI agents to lower the sense of speech anxiety and aiding in quality of English
conversational ability. The subject group assigned to AI exposure were asked to fill in responses
to 7 additional survey items in order to gauge their attitude toward AI. Since there was no basis
for comparison with the unexposed control group, no tests of hypothesis were carried out, and only
the descriptive statistics are shown (Table 2). In addition, oral interviews were conducted on the
AI participants to collect some of their impressions not otherwise recorded in either the Anxiety
or AI questionnaires. These results were not analyzed statistically due to their essentially
qualitative nature, only the frequency counts for the AI usage are presented (Tables 5 and 6).
Nevertheless, it is felt that the content and frequency counts of comments were quite informative.

Discussion
The issues touched upon in this article, even though studied within a narrowly defined location
and sampled segment of the general population, are likely to be to a significant portion
representative of the global circumstances. That is to say that with ever encroaching importance
of English, both for its own sake as a repository of world’s literature, culture, history and social
sciences, as well as a lingua franca in commerce, politics, media and technological and scientific
networks, it exerts a powerful incentive to a learner to master its various elements, including
speech as assessed by IELTS test. The results may be somewhat skewed by the fact that the
participants were self-selected according to their preference to either use or avoid exposure to
English AI chabot. The reasons may be manifold, including their attained level of language control,
whereby those who felt sufficiently comfortable saw no need for further exertion or due to busy
work schedule including travel abroad, conflicting with study requirements, provided selfinvigilated control, i.e., were unwilling to engage with English-speaking AI agents in their free
time. However, their English speech competence did not significantly differ at baseline. The
principal motive behind this research question and study design is to address the feedback-driven
linkage between speech anxiety and speech performance in a live environment as it relates to
conversational English, whereby the psychological and physiological effects deprive the wouldbe user of even that degree of fluency of which they are otherwise perfectly capable. This
relationship is exacerbated in East Asian cultures by the fact that extraversion and assertiveness
are not necessarily regarded as positive personality traits and yet these cultures form the significant
bulk of English as a second language (ESL) learners. Hence, the idea that if these populations were
exposed to a capable English-speaking interlocutor that was at the same time socially benign, i.e.,
incapable of personal judgment and opprobrium, the learners would be able to devote more
unimpeded time and effort to immerse themselves in free spoken English interaction. Even within
the number of limitations constraining this study, namely small sample size, short time frame,
paucity of financial and staffing support, relatively unsophisticated nature of the English chatbot,
which is to say, Google Assistant as the best freely available option, the basic question posed has
to an extent been answered in a largely positive way. To be noted is that all the baseline correlation
coefficients relating anxiety to IELTS score are negative, which is to make two points: that the
participants, insofar as they represent adult population are able to accurately coordinate their
perceived speech anxiety to their actual English speaking ability as measured by IELTS and
moreover, that the 10-item anxiety gauging survey designed specifically for this occasion functions
satisfactorily, further refinements subject to internal tests of the construct consistency and validity
notwithstanding. On the other hand, the coefficients corresponding to changes are positive,
providing retrospective justification for the reverse coding of a number of Anxiety item scales and
even more importantly, demonstrate the three-way linkage between extended use of AI chatbot,
anxiety reduction over 4 week period (expressed as a positive number as per Likert scale coding
of items tracking a negative emotion, so that subtracting a larger negative from a lesser one ends
up on the plus side of zero) and actual, albeit small improvement in IELTS assessment. The claim
is not promoted here that the modest speech improvement as measured by IELTS is due to salutary
action of AI chatbot exposure but rather through reduction of anxiety that frees up the user’s
already existing capacity for meaningful English discourse. This is still to be considered quite an
encouraging development despite the aforementioned study limitations of sample size, study
duration and AI shortcomings. To gain further insight into this dynamic, consider that Moore
(2017) states: “How long does it take to improve an IELTS score? To go up 1 band in IELTS takes

most students approximately 200 to 300 hours of study, consisting of face-to-face tuition and
guided self-study …” (P. 4). Referring to the “Fluency and Coherence” IELTS component in Table
3, while the Control group showed no change, the AI group presented 5 single band increases,
almost reaching a statistical significance at p<0.061. Fluency and coherence would be the speech
element most rapidly affected through free-wheeling conversational exchanges with the AI agent
and of course, 4 weeks of intermittent exposure to AI cannot compare to 200-300 hours of
intensive, directed language study facilitated by face-to-face tutors. Hopefully the results presented
herein provide the proof of concept, vectors of further inquiry into the subject as well as pilot data
for future study design, including sample size calculation and requisite time frames. As the
development of AI abilities proceeds apace, the future research endeavors will have the advantage
of a much more satisfactory potential for human-non-human AI interaction, hopefully offering indepth, involved conversations rather than the present question-answer exchanges, a feature
considered a hindrance to more binding engagement by the present participants. To this end, the
AI users’ responses to the final brief interview and request for personal input of choice regarding
their experience of the 4-week involvement with the AI chatbot are illuminating in the level of
anticipatory, enthusiastic support for further improvements and prospects, in that 95% felt that the
experience left them with a greater sense of confidence, i.e., lessened anxiety regarding their
approach to oral English communication and 89% felt that it can improve their English speaking
ability in future. It is the investigator’s opinion that this should inform the future efforts in this
direction.
Conclusion
The present study was conceived and designed to address the question whether the detrimental
effect of social anxiety or stage fright on acquisition and use of a foreign language, English in
particular, can be palliated through extemporaneous exposure to a non-human, non-threatening,
yet competent conversational partner, specifically, a speech-enabled artificial intelligence (AI)
agent, commonly known as a chatbot. To this end, a relatively brief and limited experiment was
designed involving 40 adult participants, self-selected into two equal sized groups, an unexposed
control and an AI-provided group to freely interact with in privacy to see whether this unsupervised
exposure aids in providing a degree of relief from public speech-related anxiety and thus, an
associated improvement in English speaking ability. A variety of instruments were developed
tailored to this aim, primarily a 10-item survey to record speech-related anxiety, concurrent with
IELTS speech test administered by an independent, blinded, licensed examiner in order to establish
correspondence between the two instruments over a 4-week period. The main conclusions drawn
from this arrangement are as follows: the validity of the 10-item anxiety survey is supported by
the IELTS results and furthermore, the test group of participants exposed to the AI agent reported
markedly reduced anxiety levels after 4 weeks of usage compared to the unexposed control group
as well as a mild trend in actual speaking improvement as reflected in IELTS test scores. A
supporting range of questionnaires and interviews geared towards the AI test group was established
for control purposes, the responses mostly demonstrating enthusiastic attitude toward the AI
experience. It is felt that this brief experiment can provide further incentive toward future research
based on larger samples, longer time frames and more advanced AI agents.
