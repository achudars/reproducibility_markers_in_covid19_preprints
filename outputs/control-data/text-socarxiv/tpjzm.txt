Abstract
This research investigates the efficiency of applying creative writing multi-tasks in developing
level 4 female English major students’ creative writing competence. The study conducted for 12
weeks in 2018- 2019 academic year, in Zulfi College of Education, Majmaah University, Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia (KSA). The sample consists of 64 female students divided equally into two groups:
experimental and control groups. The experimental group studied an advanced college writing
course supported by the creative writing multitasks designed by the researcher. A group of pre and
posttest design was applied in the study. When the pre and posttest’s scores of the experimental
group were analyzed and compared, it was detected that there was a statistically considerable
difference in the pre- and posttest scores, in favor of posttest’s score. Also, it shows that there was
a significant difference in the mean scores of the experimental and control group posttest’s scores,
favoring the experimental group posttest’s score. These results prove the main research hypothesis:
Creative writing multi-tasks have a significant impact on developing the experimental group’s
creative writing competence, compared to the control group. The findings indicate that using
creative writing multitasks has a positive effect on developing the students’ creative writing
competence in both fiction and nonfiction essays. It is recommended for English language teachers
to adopt similar creative writing multitasks when teaching writing skill.

1.0 Introduction
Creativity, in general, is defined by Boden (2001, p. 95) as, the skill of coming out with new ideas
that are surprising, intelligible, and also valuable in some way. Creativity is essential to innovation,
novelty, and sustenance (Kaplan, 2019). According to Barnet, Borto & Cain (1997, p. 17), writing
is not just a way of expressing pleasure, but it is also a way of learning and teaching others. They
added: Writing skill is one of the essential language skills requires for both academic and
professional performance. Developing English as foreign language creative writing skills is an
inevitable task. Today, written communication is necessary for social and business purposes
through platforms such as Google, e-mail, and other applications ‘text messaging. Creative writing
is more than just a passion; it is a craft for practicing, individual writing awareness, and following
effective writing processes all play decisive roles in producing written texts (Larkin, 2009).
Teaching creative writing is to encourage the students to write by drawing upon their imaginations,
and other creative processes may support writing development in all its component as suggested
by (Barbot, Tan, Randi, Donato & Grigorenko, 2012).
Creative writing goal is not just assisting and enabling learning; it can also provide alternative
ways of expressing and demonstrating teaching (Everett, 2005). Unfortunately, schools don’t pay
much attention to teach creatively or train their teachers on how to teach creatively (Kim, 2011).
1.1 Purposes
Although many research were carried out in creative writing’s field, it still needs more efforts to
design and describe new activities accompanied by modern methods and techniques for teaching
and assessing creative writing skills. Therefore, the primary purposes of the current study aimed
at a) Develop EFL students’ creative writing competence by making a connection between creative
writing theory and practice. b) Design a plan for intensive multitasks to dedicate more class time
to practicing writing. c) Create opportunities and motivation for EFL university students to engage
in enjoyable activities and discover their writing skills and bring them to be alive. d) Create a
standardized assessment scoring scale that helps teachers to learn the assessment criteria for
evaluating students’ creativity as well as discover what to assess and what to focus on while
teaching creative writing.
1.2 The problem
Developing English language students’ writing skills, in general, and creative writing skills, in
particular, seen as difficult tasks for non-native speaker. They need mastery of its mechanism and
process such as contents, organizations, vocabulary, punctuations, spelling firstly, and creativity
secondly. The researcher assumed the problem originated from the lack of adequate practice time.
Besides, the suitable writing techniques and processes are poorly taught at schools as experienced
by the researcher. Nowadays, university students complain of wasting a full university year as
freshmen in a preparatory English course. At the university level, the students are asked to write
assignments and papers creatively in different English language courses. Furthermore, curriculum
designers in EFL countries avoid introducing creative writing as a separate course into the
curriculum at all levels. Instead, all English language courses focus on academic writing, grades,
and circling the correct answer in tests and have no space to write.

1.3 Hypotheses
The researcher proposed the following hypotheses:
1) There is a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of the experimental group
in pre and posttest, favoring the posttest scores.
2) There is a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of the experimental group
posttest compared to the control group scores, favoring the posttest scores of the
experimental group.
3) The creative writing multi-tasks have a considerable impact on developing the
experimental group’s creative writing competence, compared with the control group.
1.4 Significance
The significance of this study arises from its various roles in building and creating positive
attitudes and confidence toward creative writing among EFL students. It tries to stop the harm
backwash about creative writing telling them; it is just like any craft, such as cooking or driving a
car, that can be learned through continuous practice, as stated by Langan (1996). Second, it has a
significant role in developing other EFL skills, such as writing research accurately and creatively.
Third, creative writing multi-task design by the researcher share in solving some EFL students’
difficulties in composing a coherent, creative written text. Fourth, above all, by improving
students’ creative writing competence, they can easily interact creatively through social media,
emails, and in their future dealings with business’ documents, which often must be written
creatively to attract attention.
1.5 Research Settings
The study is limited to the following settings:
1) Experimental and controlled groups of 32 female EFL English major students at level 6
attending Zulfi College of Education in Majmaah University, KSA.
2) Creative writing multitasks prepared by the researcher that was integrated and taught
within Zulfi College of Education’s writing skills course.
3) It lasted for twelve weeks of the first semester of the academic year 2018–2019.
2.0 Background
2.1 Creative Writing
Scholars have developed several theories on writing skills, but these can be confusing for preservice and in-service teachers searching for the best methods or philosophy to learn how to teach
writing. Teachers and students may ask themselves whether creative writing can be taught, whether
it can be learned, and about the challenges that both teachers and learners face.
One answer for the above questions provided by Hamand (2014, p. 24): “In order to learn or
teach how to write, learners and teachers should adopt the following techniques: firstly, by creating
a sentence and stringing another after it, but this needs hard work and practice”, another way, as
she adds, imitating the great writers’ description techniques”. According to Earnshow, (2014, p.
4), learners need to read first and foremost about how others did it, and teachers should provide
students with a generous and exciting reading list as a resource for writing, He added, to learn how
to write, you have to repeat the action many times as a musician and dancer do, must repeat the
step enough.

The power to be creative, as stated by Thomas (2014, p. 21), is within each one, but the
challenge is to open ourselves up to it. He added, there are many keys to keep in your mind to
write creatively: curiosity, passion, determination, awareness, energy, sensitivity, a listening ear,
and an observant eye. An advantage of creative writing is that it has various healing powers and
can reduce depression and rumination, improve self-image, and organize thoughts, emotions, and
behavior. (Kaufman and Kaufman, 2009). There is a saying that claims all people have a book
inside them, and anyone has dreams, ideas, hopes, and fears, as well as a certain amount of
imagination (Morley, 2007). What most people lack, however, are skills and knowledge of how to
turn ideas into a story that others want to read; writers are born to put words on paper and show
the life of the language. (Gaffield, 1998).
James (2009) suggests some guidelines of (Emshoff, 2008; Mowbray et al., 2008, p. 4) for
teachers to put them in their consideration when implementing Fidelity Criteria Program model as
following:
to draw from a specific program model that has already been explicitly described, to
conduct component analysis to determine which program components are essential, to
draw upon the program’s logic model to build upon the theoretical linkages between the
activities and outcomes.
In his debate on educational change, Elliott (1991) states that “students seem to waste a lot of time
in the class and he looks into the ways that teachers can increase the time students spend on tasks”
(p.72). The researcher followed this recommendation and implemented it through CW multitasks.
2.2 Creative Writing Competence
Creative writing competence is the knowledge, skills, and abilities and behaviors that study tries
to improve to build individual’s ability to: a) apply flexible writing skills appropriate to a variety
of writing tasks and genres. b) Organize a piece of writing into a coherent and readable piece of
writing. c) Create their fiction and nonfiction. d) Able to criticize and analyze several genres of
writing.
2.3 Creative Writing Techniques
The best techniques to get students to write creatively are :First, teachers need to give transparent
writing processes’ instructions, procedures, and mechanism. Second, students have to practice
writing regularly in all subjects. Third, teachers must provide models of excellent essays in all
target subject areas. Fourth, sometimes students are confused by the various requirements from
topic to topic. Therefore, teachers should keep cycling through the writing process. The fifth
technique is that at the latest stages the teacher has to direct the students to be responsible for
assessing their writings and proofreading to improve the accuracy of their works, which is very
important for future writing progress. The final technique, the teacher should give appropriate
written feedback on students’ errors to support students’ writing competence growth and to reach
their intended goals and improve their outcomes. Feedback plays a significant role in correcting
students’ mistakes. (Indira, 2017).

2.4 Creative Writing Strategies
There are some useful strategies students should be aware of that may contribute to the success of
any given piece of creative writing, as stated by Morley (2007, p. 28): “Creative reading is the
kindest favor students can do for themselves if they aspire to be a creative writer because serious
writers allow themselves to be open to influence” . He adds, “writing is stronger and more focused
when the students learn to think of a specific moment in time or a specific effect or image that he
or she wants to use to interest and surprise their readers.” The last point is providing details, which
is very important for creating an image because it moves the reader away from a general idea
toward a specific one.
2.5 Creative Writing Process
Concerning the creative writing process, Morley (2007), suggests seven methods of creative
writing as follows:
First. is the preparation, which includes active reading, imitation, research, play, and
reflection. Second, is to plan using brainstorming. Third, incubation that creates an incoming
wave of the subconscious that washes over the pages you will write. Fourth, beginning,
begin rewriting some of these into sentences or lines of meaning and start the forward
stagger into writing. Fifth, flowing, is to maintain a steady flow of work, even a mechanical
word count, putting in the hours, and writing quickly and uninhibitedly. Sixth, the silence
reservoir, is to give yourself the time to recover your eloquence through silence. You will
find, as you do so, that the reservoir fills quickly, and words and phrases rise. Seven and
finally, breakthroughs and finish.” (p. 125).
Based on the above literature review, most scholars and researchers in this field are focusing on
the need for paying more attention to developing CW skills at all educational levels. They suggest
several strategies and processes for improving creative writing among learners. The significance
of this research is in its attempt to implement them to fill the gap between these theories and
practice and bring them alive.
There are many recent studies concerning creative writing’s development, such as
Alameddinea and Mirzab (2016) that aligned with this study in which they have developed an
academic writing essay template for students to follow. They used a pretest-posttest design to
obtain the study data, and they used a common core, nationally standardized writing rubric to
evaluate the data. Their results showed that using an essay template played a significant role in
improving the learners’ academic writing skills.
In a recent study carried out by (Rohmah, Widiati, and Malik, 2017) they found that many
students had a big problem with English grammar, appropriate tense, and well-ordered sentences.
Moreover, “individual writing seemed to be ineffective because it does not give any chance for the
students to learn from their classmates. The current research supports their call for collaboration
in writing classes, for its significant role in providing students more space to share experience and
make their voice heard by others.

Tok and Kandemir (2015), examined the effects of using creative writing’s activities on 7thgrade students’ achievement in writing skills, writing disposition, and their attitudes toward
English. They used pre- and posttests in the study. The findings show that the students’ writing
skills and attitudes about writing improved after the intervention, but their attitudes toward English
did not change. Finally, it shows that creative writing exercises have a positive effect on creative
writing achievement and writing disposition in 7th grade English language classes in elementary
school. Their objectives were consistent with the current study aims at developing students’
creative writing competence.
3.0 Methodology
3.1 Design
The research adopts an experimental approach. Two groups were assigned to participate in the
research; (experimental and controlled groups).
The researcher will teach creative writing using multi-tasks to an experimental group at
Majmaah University. These multi-tasks will guide those students step by step to invent creative
writing fiction and non- fiction essays. They are going to follow both the writing and creative
writing mechanisms.
3.2 Participants
To achieve the aims, the researcher used a sample consisted of 64 EFL female English major
students studying at Level 6, at Majmaah University, KSA. The study divided the participants into
two groups; the experimental group of (n=32), and the controlled group of (n=32). The two groups
were equal in their previous learning accomplishment in the English language writing courses. The
students who participated in the study had already passed two past college writing courses (Writing
1 and 2). The two groups were divided, as shown in Table 1.

3.3 Tools
The research used the following tools. The first tool was for testing, the second for teaching, and
the third one for evaluating students’ creative writing competence. The pre/ posttest were used to
explore experimental and controlled groups’ performance in writing fiction and non-fiction essays.
The second tool was CW multitasks, which used to practice CW. The third tool was an analytical
scoring scale that modified from John Anderson and Jacobs’ analytical scoring scales after being
modified and developed to fit the research objectives in assessing students’ CW achievement. All
tools were evaluated by eight referees, who are experts in the field to check validity and reliability.
The following is a brief review of the study tools:

Writing skill is seen as an essential part of communication that let a writer writes freely away from
face-to-face stress. English writing pretest was designed to test the experimental and control
groups’ writing competence in general and to depict signs of creative writing in particular, before
applying the CW multitasks. The pretest included three fiction and non-fiction options. This
pretest not only assesses students’ writing performance, but it also gives insight about the area
needs focus. The researcher used the pretest as a ground to build on when starting teaching the
creative writing multi-tasks designed by the researcher. The reliability coefficient indicates the
reliability of the pretest. The validity of the test was approved and validated by a group of
university teachers who are experts in the field. The total score of the pretest was 100 points
divided among ten criteria.
3.3.2 Posttest
This test was carried out at the end of the course to measure if there is any significant difference
between the experimental and control groups on the posttests’ scores. The posttest measures the
impact of the creative writing’s multitasks on the experimental group posttest’s scores compared
with the control group, which didn’t practice the same creative writing multi-tasks. It also aimed
at examining the differences between the means of the experimental group’s scores on the pre and
posttests to ascertain the validity of the hypotheses using statistical analysis method. The total of
the posttest’s score was 100 points divided equally among the ten criteria.
3.3.3 Multitasks’ plan and Instructions
The researcher called it multi-tasks because they varied from non-fiction to fiction (informative
and descriptive essays, short stories, past events, and memoirs. To design the CW multi-task plan,
the researcher consulted many recent books, textbooks, research, and online resources such as
(Earnshow, 2014, Hamand, 2014, Langan, 1996, Morley, 2007) and others. Moreover, a variety of
writing tasks (fiction and nonfiction) were checked to help in designing this plan to foster students’
CW competence. The Multi-tasks prepared by following many standard strategies that offered by
many professionals, study centers, web centers, web tutorials, and writing centers. They
accompanied by videos, photos, stories, links, various prompts, and models, read many extracts
from works of famous writers. These samples sent to students via the university Desire2Learn
system, then the students write an original guided work. With the assists of these Multitasks,
students are expected to complete many intensive classes and homework’s assignments that lead
all to full mastery of writings which organized under the term "creative writing.
The research employed some of Langan (1996, p. 28) following techniques and procedures to
develop the experimental group’s CW competence: a) having students read to learn and
encouraging them to imitate other writers, train the students how to use brainstorming to collect
keywords and ideas, outlining, listening, proofreading and publish as the main tools of prewriting
technique. b) Let the students continue writing for many sessions without disturbing them or
making them stop and revise their work. c) Encouraging students to recall their memories, events,
and daydreams by creating an enjoyable environment”. d) Toward the final session, the teacher
assisted the students in correcting their work, and later they can work by themselves and be
responsible for proofreading their work without the group or teacher involvement.

Elizabeth, Margaret & Jack (2009, p. xx) suggested another technique by forming writing’s
groups through which uncreative students can be inspired and come under the umbrella of those
who show signs of apparent creativity.
3.3.4 Scoring Scale
The pre- and posttests were assessed using a standardized creative writing analytical scoring scale
designed by the researcher after examining many rubrics designed by many scholars such as
Blamires and Peterson (2014), and Goos and Salamon (2017). A rubric was then developed to suit
the study. The scoring scale consisted of ten criteria, each of which was worth ten points, for a
total of 100 points. The scoring scale measured the features of essential writing skill and creative
writing competence because both were linked together.

3.4 Piloting the experimental tools
The researcher applied pre-the and posttest on a random sample of 20 students. The pilot
experiment aimed to accomplish the following:
3.4.1. Establish the clarity of the instructions in the study tools
The pre- and posttest were first tested on the pilot sample to check the clarity of the instructions
and the tests’ components. The experiment showed that the pre- and posttest’s instructions and
parts were clear because no student raised a question during the pilot period about ambiguity in
the guidelines or the test components.

3.4.2 Calculate the stability coefficients of the tests
The study used Cronbach’s alpha and the split-half equation to calculate and confirm the stability
coefficient of the tests, as shown in Table 3:
Table 3. Calculation of the stability of the tests.
Cronbach’s alpha
Stability of the tests

Table 3. shows that the Cronbach’s alpha was 0.8835, while the split-half in the tests’ division
was 0.8225. It indicates that the tests have a high degree of stability, which ensures the strength
of the research tools.
3.4.3. Calculate the validity of the pre and posttests
The study used Alpha Cronbach’s test to measure the efficacy of both tests. The findings, as in
the below table:

Table 5 shows that the ease and difficulty coefficients are mostly acceptable. The overall ease
coefficient was 0.57, and the total difficulty factor was 0.43, which indicates the ratios are
approaching 0.50; this average value indicates a good and acceptable balance in the tests’
components in terms of ease and difficulty.
3.4.5 Identifying the coefficient of discrimination
It refers to the test component’s ability to distinguish between the highest and lowest scoring
groups. It means, the tests ’ parts that measure students writing skill using a rubric design are valid
in achieving their functions in the tests, which means that they are accurate in distinguishing
between outstanding and weak students.
The coefficient of discrimination was calculated according to the following equation:
Coefficient of discrimination =
𝑁𝑜. 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑢𝑝𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝
÷

−

𝑁𝑜. 𝑜𝑓 𝑐𝑜𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡 𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟𝑠 𝑖𝑛 𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑒𝑟 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝

𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑛𝑜. 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑡𝑤𝑜 𝑔𝑟𝑜𝑢𝑝𝑠

The grades were divided according to the ETA square to calculate the coefficient of
discrimination, where the students were classified into low and high categories. The low group
obtained the lowest total scores on the test (7.25 or lower) while the group with the highest score
got 10.0 and above, it was the most top scores. The coefficients of discrimination are shown in

Table 6 shows that the coefficient of discrimination result was 0.80, which indicated that the test
as a whole has an excellent ability to discriminate actively from weak students, as do all of the
tests’ components.
3.4.6 Equivalence between the experimental and control groups pretest’ score
A pretest was carried out for assessing and measuring the difference or the equivalent between the
experimental and control groups creative writing’s competence; both groups study at the same
level. The researcher used an independent sample t-test to find out whether there was a statistically
significant difference between the pre-test of the two groups or not. The results show that the
mean score in the pretest of experimental and controlled groups was at 0.05. The results, as shown
in Table 7:

pretest were statically equivalent, and it was at level (0.05). It means that there is no statistically
significant difference between the two groups at a high level in the pretest scores. The equivalence
in the pretest scores of the two groups indicated that a) the validity of the test to be used in the
experiment; b) the creative writing multitasks can be implemented with the experimental group.
The posttest design carried out at the end of the course to compare it with the same group pretest’s
scores to examine to what extent these multitasks play a significant role in developing the
experimental group’s creative writing competence.
4.0 Findings
Hypothesis 1): There is a statistically significant difference in the pre- and posttest’s scores of the
experimental group in the creative writing tests, with a higher posttest score. The researcher used
the paired samples t-test to find out whether there was a statistically significant difference between
the mean scores in pre- and posttest of the experimental group or not. The results, as shown in

Table 9 shows that there was a statistically significant difference at (0.05) in the mean scores
of the experimental group posttest compared to the control group scores; it was at 0.01 and below.
Based on these results, Hypothesis 2 was accepted because there was a statistically significant
difference at (0.05) in the mean scores of the experimental and controlled groups’ posttest scores;
this difference was at (0.396) for the dimensions as a whole, and their sub-values ranged from
(0.288) to (0.284). The result supports the effectiveness of using multitasks in developing the
creative writing competence of the experimental group. Based on this result, hypothesis one was
accepted.
Hypothesis 3): Creative writing multi-tasks have a significant impact on developing the
experimental group’s creative writing competence, compared to the control group.
The first and the second hypotheses supported and proved the third hypothesis that creative
writing multitasks were effective and had a significant role in developing EFL female students’
creative writing competence.
5.0 Discussion
The primary purpose of this research was to assess the efficiency of using multitasks in promoting
creative writing competence among female English majors at Majmaah University, KSA. The
researcher hypothesized that continuous practice using diversified creative writing multitasks
would play a significant role in improving student writing competence. These results were
consistent with Alameddinea and Mirzab’s study (2016) about teaching 10th-grade academic
writing. They collect the data via pre- and posttest’s essays and were evaluated using the “Common
Core Standards Writing Rubric.” The results revealed that there was a statistically significant
difference in the mean scores of the experimental group’s pre and posttest, with higher scores on

the posttest. These results indicated that applying the designed essay template improved the
learners’ academic writing.
The results of this research also went in one line with Arthur and Zell’s (1996) research. Their
study aimed at improving a creative writing instructional program focusing on speaking activities,
to examine its effect on 4th-grade primary school students’ creative writing achievement and
attitudes toward writing. They applied a pre- and posttest model. The study findings showed there
were significant differences in the control and experimental groups’ tests scores in writing attitudes
and creative writing’s achievement, with higher scores in the experimental group.
The current study also agreed with the study of Tok and Kandemir(2015). They have
investigated the effects of using creative writing activities on 7th-grade students’ achievement in
writing skill, writing dispositions, and their attitude toward English. A pretest-posttest design was
used in the study. In comparing the pre and posttest scores, they found that the students’
achievements in writing skills and dispositions were increased when compared to their level before
the experiment, but the students’ attitude toward English courses wasn’t increased. Their findings
agreed with the current study’s findings that creative writing activities have a significant effect on
developing students’ creative writing competence.
Finally, this study goes in one line with the study results of Naser, Syeda, and Shelina (2013),
they aimed to improve the written expressions (composition) skills of 5th- grade students at an Elite
Private School. The baseline assessment was carried out to discover the pre-intervention writing
skill score of the students before the intervention cycle one. In the end, the intervention and writing
skill support strategies were carried out for eight weeks. A post-test was carried out to explore the
differences that occurred in the writing score of the students as a post-intervention effect. The
findings from the quantitative data showed an improvement in the written expressions skills of the
students. These results confirmed the statistical differences in the posttest scores compared with
pretest score (favoring the posttest scores). These findings were consistent with the results of the
current study.
6.0 Conclusion
As a result of the practical evidence gained from the statistical analysis of the research data; this
research can be contributed much in a better understanding of the role that creative writing
multitasks may play as follows a) creative writing multitasks played a significant role in
developing female EFL students’ creative writing competence in both fiction and nonfiction
essays. The evidence is that the experimental group’s high posttest scores compared to their pretest
scores and the control group’s posttest scores; b) The creative writing multi-tasks provided EFL
students with various activities and samples that started from the early stages of the writing process
to the advanced ones, c) These tasks gave the students an opportunity to experience, taste, and
sense the beauty of the English language, d) Applying a standardized assessment scoring scale
makes the tests more reliable; e) The regular feedback on the students’ writing products helped the
students to discover the area that needs more efforts and overcome their prejudice that creative
writing’s ability is something born with an individual and it will never learn. Finally, the CW
multitasks not only improved CW competence among the students, but also mended and improved
their essay formatting, sentence construction, and basic writing techniques.

To conclude, at the end of the experiment, most of the experimental group’s participants
became very excited and confident; they were comfortable. The steady and good progress in the
students’ creative writing competence shows that through strong determination and regular
practice and put in more efforts to learn things; everything can be learned. These provide evidence
that applying the creative writing multitasks far more beneficial than the researcher and students
predict.
This study was limited to develop EFL female English students’ creative writing competence
using a designed multitasks.
7.0 Recommendations
Based on the findings and conclusion of the research, some practical suggestions are presented to
meet the interest of English teachers, educators, syllabi, and curriculum designers and the
researcher in the field. The researcher recommends the following:
1) Creative writing multi-tasks should consider as the primary tool for building students
creative writing in particular and writing ability as general.
2) To improve teaching methods and techniques for building writing skills in EFL writing
classes, teachers should design multitasks and assessment scoring scale criteria.
3) Regular assessment and feedback should be used to assess students’ creative writing
products to put the students on the right track.
4) Curriculum designers have to introduce creative writing multitasks’ syllabi into all
educational levels.
5) Teachers’ education and professional development programs should provide training
opportunities, requirements, and facilities for teaching creative writing.
7.1 Suggestions for further study
The researcher suggests the following for future research:
1) Conduct future studies on the obstacles encountered when introducing a creative writing
course into the learning and teaching processes.
2) Conduct a future study to invent an electronic application resembling that used for
automatic translation consists of written phrases and sentences for EFL learners to use to
promote their creative writing competence.
