Politics, Religion, Attribution Theory, and Attitudes toward Same-Sex Unions
Andrew L. Whitehead
Clemson University
Objective: The relationship between beliefs about the cause of homosexuality, political and religious
ideology, and attitudes toward same-sex unions in the United States is unclear. This study aims to
examine the mediating influence and socially embedded nature of attribution beliefs at a time when
attitudes toward same-sex unions are undergoing substantial changes in the American public.
Method: This study employs simultaneous equation path models and a recent national, random sample
of American adults (Baylor Religion Survey 2010) to test each hypothesis.
Results: Results reveal that constructed opinions about the origin and controllability of homosexuality
significantly influence support for same-sex unions. However, these opinions are socially embedded,
especially within particular political and religious ideologies.
Conclusion: These findings highlight that while widespread changes in beliefs about the cause of
homosexuality may presage shifts in support for same-sex unions, many will be able to resist those
shifts toward support, possibly leading to their further marginalization within society.

Recent research reveals that attitudes toward same-sex unions are influenced by a number of
sources. Predictably, political views and religious beliefs are powerful predictors of an individuals’
view of same-sex unions (Sherkat et al. 2011). However, a growing number of studies suggest that
how individuals perceive the cause of homosexuality is an important mediator of political and religious
influences (Haider-Markel and Joslyn 2008; Whitehead 2010; Wood and Bartkowski 2004). First,
political views and religious beliefs influence individuals’ attribution of the cause of homosexuality.
Then, in separate models, those attributions influence individuals’ views toward same-sex unions even
when controlling for political and religious influences. While the association between politics, religion,
and same-sex unions never disappears, it is reduced with the inclusion of attribution beliefs.
Furthermore, attribution beliefs are the strongest predictors in the model. This suggests that political
and religious beliefs influence the attribution beliefs individuals maintain, which then sway their views
toward same-sex unions. However, none of the studies examining attribution beliefs and same-sex
union attitudes have tested this proposed relationship. The present analysis provides such a test. Using
a recent, national survey of American adults and simultaneous equation path analysis, this study
advances the current literature on attitudes toward same-sex unions and attribution theory. The
importance of attribution beliefs finds strong support. Shifts in these beliefs will affect attitudes toward
same-sex unions. However, these analyses also demonstrate that attribution beliefs are socially
embedded. Therefore, despite changes in someone’s attribution beliefs, or evidence that might make
certain attribution beliefs untenable, attitudes toward same-sex unions could remain stable.
Religion, Politics, and Attitudes toward Same-Sex Unions
Recent literature on the relationship between religion and attitudes toward homosexuality
focuses specifically on the right of lesbians and gays to marry or obtain civil unions. It highlights
religious belief, behavior, and affiliation as important predictors of an individuals’ level of acceptance
of same-sex rights. Religious belief, such as a literal view of the Bible, is associated with nonapproving stances regarding same-sex rights (Sherkat et al. 2011; Whitehead 2010). Biblical literalism

is always one of the most powerful predictors of attitudes toward same-sex unions. Individuals who
frequently attend religious services or who consistently engage in private religious devotions such as
prayer or scripture reading are less likely to be favorable toward same-sex unions (Haider-Markel and
Joslyn 2008; Olson et al. 2006). Finally, Evangelical and Black Protestant denominations are less
accepting of same-sex marriage or civil unions than Mainline Protestants, Jews, and the unaffiliated
(Olson et al. 2006; Sherkat, de Vries, and Creek 2010). In general, religious conservatism is
consistently associated with various attitudes toward lesbians and gays and their civil rights.
Political views and affiliations are robustly associated with attitudes toward same-sex unions.
Individuals who identify as politically liberal are time and again more favorable toward gays and
lesbians having the right to marry or obtain civil unions (Haider-Markel and Joslyn 2008; Sherkat et al.
2011). Conversely, more conservative political views associate with less support for same-sex unions.
Net of a variety of other effects, political conservatism is one of the most prominent predictors of
attitudes toward same-sex unions.
Attribution Theory and Attitudes toward Same-Sex Unions
Perceptions of the cause of homosexuality are crucial when predicting attitudes toward samesex civil rights. Central to this argument is whether or not gays and lesbians can “control” their
orientation. Attribution theory was first proposed by Austrian psychologist Fritz Heider (1944; 1958).
He theorized that individuals seek to explain the behaviors of those around them in an attempt to
predict and control their environment by attributing others’ behavior to either internal or external
causes. Weiner (1979; 1985) furthered attribution theory by emphasizing the concept of
controllability. When certain behaviors are labeled “controllable” the person exhibiting the behavior
can be held responsible while behaviors labeled “uncontrollable” mean the person exhibiting the
behavior is less likely to be held accountable. If the behavior in question is stigmatized in some way
and considered controllable, those exhibiting the behavior are much more likely to be viewed
negatively. A number of studies find support for attribution theory when investigating attitudes toward

poverty (Griffin and Oheneba-Sakyi 1993; Zucker and Weiner 1993), obesity (Crocker, Cornwell, and
Major 1993), and when comparing stigmas commonly classified as uncontrollable (Alzheimer’s)
versus controllable (AIDS) (Weiner, Perry, and Magnusson 1988).
Studies investigating attitudes toward gays and lesbians provide additional support for
attribution theory (Herek 2002; Herek and Capitanio 1995; Sakalli 2002). Individuals who attribute
homosexuality to a source outside personal control are more likely to hold favorable views of lesbians
and gays while individuals who believe lesbians and gays choose their orientation are less likely to be
favorable. Some researchers suggest that an individual’s belief about the cause of homosexuality is the
single most important predictor of attitudes toward gays and lesbians (Herek and Capitanio 1995:95).
Recent work investigating attitudes toward same-sex unions continues to apply attribution theory.
Support for same-sex marriage and civil unions is much more likely if homosexuality is believed to be
the result of natural or biological forces outside the individuals’ locus of control (Haider-Markel and
Joslyn 2008; Wood and Bartkowski 2004). Conversely, support for same-sex unions is less likely if
individuals believe homosexuality is the result of a choice (Whitehead 2010; Wood and Bartkowski
2004). In each of these studies individuals’ attribution beliefs are the strongest predictors of attitudes
toward same-sex unions even while controlling for demographic, political, and religion measures.
Religion, Politics, and Attributions of the Cause of Homosexuality
Due to the power of attribution beliefs, researchers investigated who is most likely to view
homosexuality as a choice or due to natural forces. Haider-Markel and Joslyn (2008) found that
religious behavior and affiliation are associated with the belief that homosexuality is the result of
genetics. Evangelical Protestants are much less likely to believe genetics influence sexual orientation
as are those who attend religious services at higher rates. Their analysis showed that political
conservatism likewise predicts an aversion toward biological explanations of homosexuality. Focusing
instead on who is more likely to believe gays and lesbians choose their sexual orientation, one study
found that biblical literalism was associated with attribution beliefs along with religious behavior and

affiliation (Whitehead 2010). Evangelical Protestants were most likely to believe that homosexuality
is the result of a choice compared to other religious traditions and individuals who attend religious
services at higher rates were more likely to believe lesbians and gays choose their orientation.
Regarding political views, individuals who identify as politically conservative were more likely to
believe that gays and lesbians choose their sexual orientation. In both of these studies, religious and
political conservatism were the most robust predictors of particular attribution views.
Toward a Structural Model
Attribution theory and the current literature detailed above imply a particular relationship
between attribution beliefs and attitudes toward same-sex unions. The results of past studies
demonstrate that religion, politics, and various other predictors are associated with attribution beliefs
but also with same-sex union attitudes. This suggests that attribution beliefs may operate as a
mediating variable, especially for religious and political conservatism. Attribution theory also proposes
this relationship: individuals acquire a particular view of the origin of a stigmatized status and this
influences their feelings about the morality or rights of the stigmatized. Again, attribution theory
focuses on how individuals attribute the cause of a behavior, such as whether it is internal or external
to the person and also whether the individual has any level of control. But from where do the
explanations for whether a behavior or status is internal or external, controllable or not, come? As
Haider-Markel and Joslyn (2008:307) state, “individuals rely heavily on ideology [and] religion . . . to
form beliefs.” In many cases religious and political ideology function as sources of moral authority that
dictate which beliefs are deemed acceptable (Whitehead and Baker 2012). These sources are vital
regarding attitudes toward gay rights and beliefs about whether same-sex attraction is due to internal or
external factors and is controllable or not. In this case, political and religious conservatism are prior to
attribution beliefs. Put another way, attribution beliefs serve as part of the explanation why religious
or political beliefs either support or oppose homosexuality.
This leads to the first hypotheses:

H1a:

Attribution beliefs mediate the relationship between political conservatism and attitudes toward

same-sex unions.
H1b:

Attribution beliefs mediate the relationship between religious conservatism and attitudes

toward same-sex unions.
Figure 1 displays these hypothesized relationships. By mediate I refer to the relational
sequence between political and religious conservatism leading to particular styles of attribution which
collectively produces a particular set of outcomes. Past analyses were unable to formally test this
assumption due to methodological limitations. These methodological limitations necessitate a more
precise modeling technique to determine if the theorized relationship exists.
[Figure 1 about here]
While past research demonstrates that attribution beliefs are without fail the strongest predictor
of same-sex union attitudes, religious and political conservatism, two important predictors of
attribution beliefs, also maintain significant and robust associations with attitudes toward same-sex
unions even when controlling for attribution beliefs (Haider-Markel and Joslyn 2008; Whitehead
2010). One explanation is that political and religious ideologies are foundational concerning attitudes
toward moral issues (Putnam and Campbell 2010; Whitehead and Baker 2012). As discussed above,
religious and political sources of moral authority are primary to attribution beliefs. This suggests that
the total effect of political conservatism, the sum of its direct effect on same-sex union attitudes and its
indirect effect mediated through attribution beliefs, may exceed the direct effect of attribution beliefs
on same-sex union attitudes. The same can be said for religious conservatism. Put differently, the
foundational influence of political and religious conservatism as sources of moral authority may
overshadow the effect of attribution beliefs because these sources of moral authority are vital to the
formation of those particular attribution beliefs.
Yet, in past studies, the possible indirect effects of political and religious conservatism on
attribution beliefs are left unexamined. This results in only being able to determine their “net” effect.

Therefore, assessing both direct and indirect effects in simultaneous equations will allow for a more
accurate analysis of the relationships between religion, politics, attribution beliefs, and attitudes toward
same-sex unions. This leads to a second and third hypothesis:
H2:

The total effect of political conservatism will exceed the total effect of attribution beliefs.

H3:

The total effect of religious conservatism will exceed the total effect of attribution beliefs.

The structure of the interrelationships in figure 1 allow for the testing of each hypothesis.
A number of substantive implications of this analysis deserve mention. If religion or political
views prove to have the largest total effect on same-sex union attitudes a growing acceptance of a
natural explanation of homosexuality could lead to increased hostility toward gays and lesbians. As
Haider-Markel and Joslyn (2008:308) point out, “the next step may not be tolerance but intervention. If
the homosexual gene can be altered or manipulated in some way, the notion that homosexuality can be
‘cured’ will surely be considered.” This prediction is supported by the fact that the possibility of a
natural explanation for homosexuality tends to only further polarize previously held beliefs (Boysen
and Vogel 2007). Boysen and Vogel (2007:755) state that “learning about biological explanations of
homosexual behavior is interpreted through the lens of preexisting attitudes.” As another study points
out, “It is possible that certain views toward attribution are co-opted, in a sense, by . . . individuals to
provide supplementary support to their previously held beliefs” (Whitehead 2010:76). Therefore, if
direct and indirect effects of religion and politics on attitudes toward same-sex unions are greater than
beliefs about the cause of homosexuality, a further polarization of positions could result if the scientific
community ever coalesces around a natural explanation. Individuals with certain political or religious
beliefs would merely jettison their chosen attribution belief and find novel ways to support and
maintain previous stances.
However, if political conservatism and religion exhibit a marginal effect on attribution beliefs
and a small total effect on same-sex union attitudes, the increased acceptance of a biological
explanation within the scientific community could reframe the entire issue of same-sex unions (Olson

et al. 2006). This reframing of the issue would lead to greater acceptance of same-sex marriage and
civil unions in larger proportions of the population. In this case individuals’ attribution beliefs would
be at the crux of their support or opposition to same-sex unions.
Data
Data for this study are taken from Wave III of the Baylor Religion Survey (BRS) fielded in
2010 by the Gallup Organization. The BRS is a national random sample of non-institutionalized
American adults. The survey utilized a mixed-mode sampling design consisting of two phases. Both
phases resulted in a total of 3,500 individuals screened and 2,556 possible respondents. A total of
1,714 questionnaires were returned resulting in a response rate of 49% [1,714/3,500] among all
individuals screened and a response rate of 67% [1,714/2,556] for those who agreed to receive a
mailed survey. The 2010 BRS is ideal for the existing research question because it is recent and
contains a number of questions pertaining to religion, political views, attitudes toward the cause of
homosexuality, and support for same-sex unions the combination of which is not found in any other
large, national survey.
Dependent Variables
The first dependent variable measures respondents’ support of same-sex civil unions. The
question in the BRS asks, “Please describe how you feel about homosexuality for the following
statements: Homosexuals should be allowed civil unions.” Possible responses range from “Strongly
Agree” to “Strongly Disagree.” The second dependent variable asks about same-sex marriage:
“Homosexuals should be allowed to legally marry.” Possible responses again range from “Strongly
Agree” to “Strongly Disagree.” Both measures were dichotomized (1 = Strongly Agree and Agree).
Mediating Variables
The mediating variables relate to respondents’ beliefs about the cause of homosexuality. One
measures whether individuals believe homosexuality results from natural causes. It asks: “Please
describe how you feel about homosexuality for the following statements: People are born either as

homosexual or heterosexual.” Possible responses range from “Strongly Agree” to “Strongly
Disagree.” The other measure of attribution beliefs asks if sexual orientation is a personal choice:
“People choose to be homosexuals.” Possible responses again range from “Strongly Agree” to
“Strongly Disagree.” Both measures were dichotomized (1 = Strongly Agree and Agree).
I utilize both measures of attitudes toward same-sex unions and both measures of attribution
beliefs available in the BRS (2010) for two reasons. First, past analyses use these as separate
variables; including each allows for comparisons between the present study and past work. Second, by
utilizing combinations of each dependent and mediating variable I can ensure that the hypothesized
relationships between religious and political conservatism, attribution beliefs, and attitudes toward
same-sex unions are persistent and not dependent upon the type of attribution belief (nature or choice)
or the type of same-sex union (marriage or civil unions) included in the model. Finally, I dichotomize
these measures because the substantive difference between supporting versus opposing same-sex
unions for each attribution belief is essential, not the differences between agreeing or strongly
agreeing. This coding strategy is commonly used in past research on this topic as well (Olson et al.
2006; Sakalli 2002; Sherkat et al. 2010; Sherkat et al. 2011; Whitehead 2010).
[Table 1 about here]
Independent Variables
The independent variables of interest include measures of both political and religious
conservatism. The question used to measure political conservatism asks respondents, “How would you
describe yourself politically?” Possible responses were “Extremely Liberal,” “Liberal,” “Leaning
Liberal,” “Moderate,” “Leaning Conservative,” “Conservative,” and “Extremely Conservative.”
Higher values correspond to more conservative political views (1 = Extremely Liberal to 7 =
Extremely Conservative).
To measure religious conservatism I rely on a measure of religious belief as well as religious
affiliation. Regarding religious belief, I utilize a question asking respondents for their view of the

Bible: “Which one statement comes closest to your personal beliefs about the Bible?” Responses
included, “The Bible means exactly what it says. It should be taken literally, word-for-word, on all
subjects,” “The Bible is perfectly true, but it should not be taken literally, word-for-word. We must
interpret its meaning,” “The Bible contains some human error,” and “The Bible is an ancient book of
history and legends.” Respondents who answered “I don’t know” were counted as missing. Higher
values correspond to more literal views of the Bible and greater religious conservatism. I account for
religious affiliation using a typology of religious traditions (Steensland et al. 2000). Categories include
Evangelical Protestant, Black Protestant, Mainline Protestant, Catholic, Jewish, Other, and No
affiliation. Evangelical Protestant serves as the contrast category.
Control Variables
A number of control variables are included in the analyses. Age (in years), race (1 = Black),
and education (1= 8th grade or less to 7 = Postgraduate work/Degree) were significantly associated
with attribution beliefs and same-sex union attitudes in past research and so each measure is allowed to
predict both the attribution and same-sex union variables. Gender (1 = Female) and religious
affiliation were found to have significant associations with attribution beliefs but not same-sex union
attitudes in past research once attribution beliefs were included in the model. Therefore, these
measures are allowed to predict the attribution measure but not the same-sex union measure. Finally,
marital status (1 = married) and region (1 = South) were found to have significant associations with
attitudes toward same-sex unions but not attribution beliefs in prior studies. So, these measures were
not allowed to predict attribution beliefs but were permitted to predict same-sex union attitudes.
A final religion measure is included. Religious behavior is determined using religious worship
service attendance. The response categories included, “Several times a week,” “Weekly,” “About
weekly,” “2-3 times a month,” “Once a month,” “Several times a year,” “Once or twice a year,” “Less
than once a year,” or “Never.” Higher values correspond to more frequent worship service attendance
(1 = Never to 9 = Several times a week). This measure is allowed to predict both attribution beliefs

and same-sex union attitudes due to findings in prior research. While it could be argued that religious
behavior is a marker of religious conservatism, political ideology and religious conservatism as defined
here operate as sources of moral authority and each can be more directly compared to attribution
beliefs in how they influence individuals. Frequent attendance, in and of itself, is not a source of moral
authority for individuals. It is where they attend and the view of the scriptures common to that group
that operate as a source of authority. For this reason, I do not treat religious behavior as a particular
marker of religious conservatism to be compared with political conservatism and attribution beliefs.
Methodology
Analyses are conducted using Mplus 6.11 to estimate the simultaneous equation path models
(Muthén and Muthén 1998-2010). Structural equation and path modeling offer methodological
improvements over standard regression techniques by accounting for the interrelationships between all
of the exogenous variables as well as assessing their direct, indirect, and joint effects (Schumacker and
Lomax 2010). This allows for investigation beyond “net” effects presented in past analyses. The
proposed mediating role of attribution beliefs can also be tested. Because both endogenous variables
are binary, a robust weighted least square parameter estimator is most appropriate (WLSMV)
(Asparouhov & Muthén 2010). WLSMV uses the diagonal of the weight matrix in the estimation
while the standard errors and the mean and variance adjusted chi-square test statistic utilize a full
weight matrix (Muthén and Muthén 1998-2010).
I utilize multiple imputation (MI) using Bayesian analysis to correct for missing data (Enders
2010; Schafer 1997). This procedure produced five data sets and parameter estimates were averaged
over the set of analyses. The standard errors were computed using the average of the standard errors
over the set of analyses and the between analysis parameter estimate variation (Muthén and Muthén
1998-2010; Schafer 1997). In order to test the first hypothesis, I make use of multiple assessments of
overall model fit. The chi-square statistic indicates whether the model-implied covariance matrix
differs significantly from the observed matrix. A significant chi-square signifies an ill-fitting model.

Because the chi-square can be influenced by larger sample sizes, I utilize additional fit indicators. Two
baseline comparison indices, the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI) and the Comparative Fit Index (CFI), and
the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) provide further confirmation of model fit. Due
to my interest in comparing the total effects across measures I report standardized coefficients. These
will allow for evaluations of the final two hypotheses.
Results
Figures 2 through 5 display the results of four simultaneous equation path models. Each model
includes one combination of attribution belief and type of same-sex union. Figures 2 and 3 focus upon
same-sex marriage. Figure 2 estimates the relationship between believing homosexuality is a choice
and same-sex marriage. The structure of the path model fits the data. The chi-square statistic is not
significant (p = 0.822). Furthermore, the CFI and TLI are both at or very near their ideal value of 1.0
and the RMSEA is less than .05 suggesting good overall model fit (Jöreskog 1993; Schumacker and
Lomax 2010). I find that age and education are negatively associated with believing homosexuality is a
choice. Women do not believe sexuality is a choice to the degree that men do. Identifying as black,
higher levels of attendance, and biblical literalism are positively associated with believing
homosexuality is a choice. Political conservatism is positively associated as well. There are no
significant differences between Evangelical Protestants and all other religious traditions including the
unaffiliated. Believing homosexuality is a choice is negatively associated with support for same-sex
marriage. Age, biblical literalism, political conservatism, and worship service attendance are
negatively associated as well. However, higher education is positively associated with support for
same-sex marriage.
[Figures 2 and 3 about here]
Figure 3 estimates the relationship between believing sexual orientation is genetic and support
for same-sex marriage. The covariance matrix implied by this model structure does not differ
significantly from the observed matrix suggesting good overall model fit. The chi-square statistic is not

significant (p = 0.615) and the CFI, TLI, and RMSEA are all at or very near their ideal values
providing additional support. The results show that age is associated with believing sexuality is present
at birth. Women tend to believe this more so than men while blacks ascribe to this view less frequently
than whites. However, political conservatism, biblical literalism, and worship service attendance are
negatively associated with believing homosexuality is the result of genetics. Again, there are no
significant differences between Evangelical Protestants and the other religious traditions and the
unaffiliated. Believing homosexuality is innate is positively associated with same-sex marriage. Level
of education is positively associated with same-sex marriage. Biblical literalism, political
conservatism, and age are negatively associated with support for same-sex marriage.
Figures 4 and 5 focus on attitudes toward same-sex civil unions. Figure 4 assesses the
relationship between believing homosexuality results from a choice and support of same-sex civil
unions. The model fit statistics indicate a good overall fit. The chi-square is not significant (p =
0.166) and the CFI, TLI, and RMSEA are all near their ideal values. Again we see that age and
education are negatively associated with believing homosexuality is a choice. Women are less likely
than men to consider homosexuality the result of a choice. Political conservatism, biblical literalism,
and religious service attendance are positively associated with believing gays and lesbians choose their
orientation. Once more, religious affiliation is not significantly associated with attribution beliefs.
Believing homosexuality is a choice is negatively associated with support for same-sex civil unions.
Age, being from the south, political conservatism, biblical literalism, and attendance are also
negatively associated. Education is positively associated with support for same-sex civil unions.
[Figures 4 and 5 about here]
Figure 5 estimates the relationship between believing homosexuality is genetic and same-sex
civil unions. The chi-square statistic is not significant (p = 0.169) and the CFI, TLI, and RMSEA
suggest that the model-implied structure is not significantly different from what is found in the data
again indicating good overall model fit. Age and gender are positively associated with believing gays

and lesbians are born with a particular sexual orientation. However, blacks are less likely to ascribe to
this view than whites. Biblical literalism, political conservatism, and religious service attendance are
all negatively associated with believing homosexuality is innate. Yet again, Evangelical Protestants
are not significantly different from any other religious tradition concerning attribution beliefs.
Believing homosexuality is innate is strongly and positively associated with support of same-sex civil
unions. Education is positively associated while age, political conservatism, and biblical literalism are
negatively associated with support for civil unions, as is being from the South.
Due to our interest in the direct, indirect, and total effect sizes rather than just “net” effects,
table 1 provides the standardized total effects for the variables of interest: attribution beliefs and
political and religious conservatism. The upper portion of the table contains the standardized results
from the models examining attitudes toward same-sex marriage with the choice attribution model on
the left and the nature attribution model on the right. The bottom portion of the table examines
attitudes toward same-sex civil unions with the standardized results from the choice attribution model
reported on the left and the standardized results from the nature attribution model reported on the right.
While religious conservatism is measured through biblical literalism and religious affiliation, only the
standardized results of biblical literalism are displayed because of the non-significance of religious
affiliation in all four models. Consistently, across all four models, attribution beliefs have the largest
total effect on attitudes toward same-sex unions. Political conservatism exhibits the next largest total
effect size across all of the models. Biblical literalism is the third largest in total effect.
[Table 1 about here]
Discussion
Results from the four simultaneous equation path models provide consistent support for the
first hypothesis. Attribution beliefs appear to operate as a mediating variable when examining
attitudes toward same-sex unions. The chi-square test statistic is not significant in each model and the
CFI, TLI, and RMSEA are all close to their ideal values. This suggests that the hypothesized model

does not differ significantly from the observed data. While past research was unable to model the
mediating role of attribution beliefs, simultaneous equation path analysis offers a more precise test of
attribution theory. It appears that individuals acquire a particular view of the origin of a stigmatized
status and this influences their feelings about the morality or rights of the stigmatized (Heider 1944,
1958; Weiner 1979, 1985).
In addition to the support for the mediating role of attribution beliefs, the results demonstrate
these beliefs exhibit the largest standardized effects across each model. Regardless of whether
attribution beliefs are operationalized using the choice or nature measures, or if same-sex marriage or
civil unions are being examined, how people define the cause of homosexuality is the strongest
predictor of their feelings toward gay rights (Herek and Capitanio 1995). Prior research expressed the
importance of attribution beliefs in comparison to other measures, especially political and religious
conservatism, but was unable to account for their indirect effects (Haider-Markel and Joslyn 2008;
Herek and Capitanio 1995; Whitehead 2010; Wood and Bartkowski 2004). The present analysis
reveals that even when accounting for the indirect effects of religious and political conservatism
attribution beliefs are still the strongest in the model. This suggests that attribution beliefs are a crucial
mechanism through which attitudes toward same-sex unions are constructed. Changes in individuals’
attribution beliefs could lead to changes in their level of support for same-sex unions.
Hypotheses 2 and 3, therefore, fail to receive support. The total effects of political
conservatism and religious conservatism fail to exceed the total effect of attribution beliefs. While
both measures are strongly associated with attribution beliefs and attitudes toward same-sex unions,
neither surpasses the total effect of attribution beliefs. Political conservatism comes close to achieving
the largest standardized total effect when predicting attitudes toward same-sex marriage with the
choice measure as the mediating variable. When comparing the standardized total effects of political
and religious conservatism we find that how individuals’ identify themselves politically is more

strongly associated with attitudes toward both attribution beliefs and same-sex unions across all
models.
A number of additional findings in line with past research are worth noting. First, higher levels
of education result in more favorable views toward same-sex unions and an unwillingness to view
homosexuality as a choice. Higher levels of religious service attendance have the opposite effect.
Interestingly, age has countervailing effects. Older adults favor the idea that homosexuality is innate
rather than a choice, but also tend to oppose same-sex marriage and civil unions. Overall, increasing
age has a negative association with attitudes toward same-sex unions. In line with previous research,
women are more likely to view homosexuality as innate rather than a choice. Past analyses show that
when controlling for attribution beliefs gender is not significantly associated with attitudes toward
same-sex unions (Whitehead 2010). The indirect effect of gender, however, is still important and
receives support in this study. The institution of marriage does not appear to have an influence on
individuals’ views of gay marriage or same-sex civil unions. Finally, religious tradition is not
significantly associated with attribution beliefs, net of all other effects. This is contrary to recent
studies where Evangelical Protestants were significantly different from other religious traditions
regarding attribution beliefs (Haider-Markel and Joslyn 2008; Whitehead 2010). Most likely, the
differences in political views, education, religious behaviors, and religious beliefs account for the
differences across religious traditions.
Several limitations of the present study should be mentioned. First, while the fit statistics
provide support that the hypothesized model tested in this analysis is a valid and good-fitting model,
they do not in any sense “prove” that this model is the only correct model (Schumacker and Lomax
2010). Other model forms may fit the data as well. It is possible that for many individuals beliefs
about the morality of homosexuality and same-sex unions are determined due to political and religious
influences and these are primary in causal order to attribution beliefs. In this sense, individuals are
either for or against gay marriage and to provide support for those beliefs, they view homosexuality as

either innate or a choice. Most likely, the causal explanation identified in figure 1 and the other
possible explanation outlined in this section both exist in reality. Both causal orders are present in
qualitative research (see Moon 2004) and could realistically be applied quantitatively.
Second, the data utilized are cross-sectional. Even when utilizing path analysis, this precludes
any possibility of determining causation. An ideal test of attribution theory would be able to
incorporate changes in the attribution beliefs of individuals over time and confirm if those changes
encouraged shifts in attitudes toward same-sex unions. This would also allow researchers to test the
two possible causal orders discussed above. Finally, a number of studies point to the differences in
attitudes toward gays versus lesbians and encourage delineating between the two when investigating
public perception toward homosexuality (Herek 2002). This distinction is not possible utilizing the
measures available in this study. Despite this limitation, Herek (2002) points out that in public
discourse lesbians and gay men share a “common characteristic that makes them members of a distinct
quasi-ethnic group with its own culture and political concerns” (Herek 2002:42). This suggests that
while the questions employed in this analysis cannot distinguish between attitudes toward lesbians and
gay men, they do tap into the broader set of attitudes maintained by a majority of the public.
Conclusion
Using a recent, national survey of American adults and a more precise modeling technique, the
present study provides support for attribution theory. More often than not, individuals construct
opinions concerning the origin and controllability of a stigmatized status that significantly influences
their attitudes toward persons in that group. It is important to recognize that attribution beliefs are
indeed socially embedded. Political, religious, educational, and demographic influences shape
attribution beliefs. So claims that only attribution beliefs make a difference are unwarranted. Changes
in the political, religious, or educational composition of the United States could serve to shift
attribution beliefs as well as attitudes toward same-sex unions. Nevertheless, future analyses of
attitudes toward gays and lesbians or same-sex unions should include the attribution beliefs of

individuals in addition to the standard collection of explanatory variables. Continued attempts to model
the interrelationships utilizing structural equation or path modeling will hopefully continue as well.
Such tests will confirm or challenge the results presented here and will provide necessary further
evaluations of attribution theory.
Substantively, the findings from this study suggest that changes in attribution beliefs lead to
changes in attitudes toward same-sex unions. Clearly, beliefs about same-sex unions and attribution
explanations are closely tied and changes in one sphere will coincide with changes in the other. In fact,
the association between attribution beliefs and same-sex union attitudes is greater than the total effects
of political ideology and religious conservatism. Therefore, if a natural explanation for homosexuality
is widely accepted, the entire issue of the legality of same-sex unions may be reframed. Individuals
who already favor same-sex unions would now possess additional support for why gays and lesbians
should be allowed to marry. Most likely, the discovery of a natural explanation for homosexuality
would encourage a change in same-sex union attitudes among those individuals who occupy the
middle ground in the debate. Individuals who are not strongly conservative either politically or
religiously would be the first to amend their views. Due to the direct effects of political and religious
conservatism on attitudes toward same-sex unions, a wider acceptance of a natural explanation of
homosexuality would lead to the further marginalization of religiously and politically conservative
individuals who oppose same-sex unions. The justification of their stance would have to be modified in
such a way as to account for the uncontrollability of sexuality. It would no doubt become much more
difficult to maintain such a stance in the midst of a culture that does not pinpoint responsibility for
sexual orientation on individuals. In this way, attribution beliefs are persistently important to the
overall discussion about homosexuality. Each side in the debate about equality for gays and lesbians is
forced to reconcile their stance in response to the different possible attributions of homosexuality,
whether those attributions provide direct support for their stance on gay rights or not.
