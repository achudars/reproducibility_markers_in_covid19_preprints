"7" "This paper presents an investigation of borrowing between Gaelic and Caithness Scots.  It also evaluates the use of Gaelic words referenced to Caithness within Gaelic areas south and west of Caithness. As a result of this investigation a number of features emerged.  Firstly, there are a high number of Gaelic words present in Caithness Scots.  Secondly, the borrowing appears to have been one way as there didn’t appear to be much borrowing from Caithness Scots into local Gaelic. Thirdly, an intriguing question arose, although out with the focus of this study, that the language boundaries apparent from terrestrial place names may not be coincident with the boundaries of names of features pertaining to the sea.   Overall the evidence suggests that there was a high degree of linguistic interaction between the Scots and Gaelic populations in Caithness."

"9" "Gaelic Words in Caithness Scots."
"10" "This paper will investigate the presence of Gaelic loanwords in Caithness Scots.  It began owing to a very simple observation.  As a Gaelic speaker familiar with local Gaelic and Gaelic-English speech spoken in the Rogart area and on the north coast the author has often noticed Gaelic words in Caithness Scots, although they are not frequently recognised as such by the speakers themselves in Caithness.  The consequence of this observation was to investigate the presence of Gaelic loanwords to be found in Caithness Scots."
"11" "As a result of this investigation number of features emerged.  Firstly, there are a high number of Gaelic words present in Caithness Scots.  Secondly, the borrowing appears to have been one way as there didn’t appear to be much borrowing from Caithness Scots into local Gaelic. Thirdly, an intriguing question arose, although out with the focus of this study, that the language boundaries apparent from terrestrial place names may not be coincident with boundaries of names of features pertaining to the sea are considered."
"12" "This investigation of Gaelic loanwords will begin with a discussion of the methodology employed and sources utilized.   There will then be a broad look at the topic of Gaelic loanwords in Scots in general and the focus will then return to Caithness itself and the historical division of the Gaelic and Scots speech communities within the area.  This will be followed a detailed look at the evidence revealed by recordings of representatives of different speech communities between the years 1982 to 2004.  Then a compilation of Gaelic loanwords will be presented and, finally, a look at Gaelic words described as pertaining to Caithness will be investigated for loanwords from Scots into Gaelic as formerly spoken in Caithness.  The overarching impression is of two interacting cultures side by side and both coming under enormous pressure from English."
"13" "The methodology employed in this study was firstly to work through the lexis of Caithness Scots compiled by Mr Iain Sutherland of Wick, Caithness which was based upon recorded interviews complied over 22 years by Mr Sutherland with representatives of different speech communities throughout Caithness.  Selections of the actual recordings themselves from which the dictionary was compiled were then reviewed.  In order to investigate a possible contrast between the Scots and Gaelic speech communities recordings were targeted which came from speakers from north and eastern areas of the county where Caithness Scots was strong and the southern and western boundaries where Gaelic was formerly spoken."
"14" "The recordings are available at the Caithness Archive Centre, Wick, Caithness.  They were donated by Mr Sutherland who is an habitual speaker of his native Caithness Scots as well as an author of a number of historical books and plays.  Based upon these recordings as well as his own extensive knowledge, Mr Sutherland complied and published,  A Caithness Dictionary  (Sutherland, n.d.) , to record the spoken language of Caithness Scots.  It is important to note that owing to the distinction between literary and spoken Scots , as explained below, the list reflects everyday spoken language and not literary language, as Mr Sutherland explains in his introduction,"
"15" "… all the words were spoken at one time or another, and I have heard nearly all of them over the last 20 years, used by the 70 or so people with whom I made tape recordings when I was preserving the different accents of Caithness.  There were about 50 different accents that I could detect, now alas surviving only among the elderly."
"16" "More than just language, Mr Sutherland’s work has provided researchers with a varied and wide ranging set of material encompassing language, history, tales and legends, place names, sea related names, and descriptions of ways of life now gone."
"17" "The subject of loanwords and other remodelling of languages has been studied widely and has included some research on the relationship between Gaelic and Scots  (McClure, 1995)  (O' Baoill, 1997)  and a lot of work has focussed upon phonology  (Pődör, 1995-1996) .    It has been pointed out frequently that there is a division between spoken and literary Scots with the result that spoken Scots contains many more loanwords from Gaelic than literary Scots  (McClure, 1995) , however it is notable that even the writing of Robert Burns contains some Gaelic  (Dorian, 1991) .  The distinction between spoken  Scots and literary Scots language is emphasized strongly."
"18" "The picture that emerges, however, is unmistakeably that of a vital, productive and enduring influence exerted by one language on the other: a far cry from literary Scots and the dialects that  are its principle sources  (McClure, 1995)"
"19" "The recordings in Caithness certainly seem to support this view."
"20" "In recent years the progress of the status of Gaelic throughout Scotland has been received very well, and Gaelic medium education is offered throughout Scotland, from Caithness to the central belt.  Such progress however, has not been without its critics.  With respect to the north of Scotland this has been evident, even at an official level, not only with regard to Gaelic education but particularly with regard to Gaelic signage.  Negative comments range from personal opinions, a waste of money, to historical assertions that, “Gaelic was never spoken here.”    Personal views about spending money are, as implied, personal, but the historical place of Gaelic in Caithness deserves and has received thorough refutation, even if the, “Gaelic was never spoken here”, proponents don’t seem to have accepted the evidence.  In this respect one can only wonder, as one researcher has asked, how such hostility can exist in face of clear evidence  (Stiùbhart, 2008) ."
"21" "Place name evidence as well as historical accounts make it clear that among the parishes in Caithness the north eastern parishes of  Bower, Canisbay and Olrig, were Scots speaking while  Gaelic was strongest in Reay and Latheron, and also Halkirk  (Duwe, 2012) .  Owing to well-known social, political and economic pressures Gaelic use declined quickly in the twentieth century, and by the time of  Mr Sutherland’s  recordings in the Gaelic parishes in the 1980s informants could not name single living speaker native to Caithness, although they remembered speakers alive in the 1950s  (SUTH/5/043, n.d.) .  It may also be said, sadly, that Caithness Scots is facing a similar situation, although on a later timescale.  In the introduction to his dictionary Mr Sutherland sadly wrote:"
"22" "This is an illustrated dictionary of words and expressions which were in common use in the county of Caithness until the latter third of the twentieth century when the introduction of television, on top of a century of persecution by the teaching profession, finally killed the language off.  I regard the process as irreversible, and have produced this book more as an obituary than anything else; to tell what it was like to those who will never have either the pleasure of using it, or the privilege of hearing it in the wonderful variety that used to exist from Reay to Sarclet, or Stroma to Berriedale."
"23" "Unfortunately for Caithness Scots, or any other variety of Scots, as yet there are no modern programmes of revival such as Gaelic has achieved."
"24" "As mentioned earlier, recordings were chosen from strong Scots speaking areas and also from areas were Gaelic was formerly spoken.  In this way it was surmised that the speakers would be expected to exhibit the greatest differences in language.  Speakers were chosen from John O’ Groats, Whaligoe and Wick to represent the Scots areas, while the Gaelic areas were represented by speakers from Latheron, Dunbeath, and Reay.  The recordings themselves are generally of good quality, considering they have been transferred from cassette to disk, and the interviewer, Iain Sutherland, was expert in raising numerous points of information and through his own deep knowledge of own language he added to the study simply by being himself."
"25" "The first recording reviewed was of a native of John O’ Groats, which of course is in the far north east of the county  (SUTH/5/020, 1990) .  The man interviewed had been a fisherman and he had a lot to say about tides, way of life, historical incidents and folklore.   He also named features pertaining to the sea such as rocks, tides and channels, mostly west from John O’ Groats toward Hunna.  Among the names he mentioned, three stand out as Gaelic or possible Gaelic names.  They are:"
"26" "Chailleach:  This was a rock the fisherman pointed out to the interviewer.  It occurred in a sentence simply as, “that is the  chailleach …”.  The initial  a’  of the article in Gaelic was left off, but the lenition remained."
"27" "Nickie:  This word was used for a channel.  It seems to suit the Gaelic word,  neag / èag , a notch or a channel, with a diminutive ending common in Caithness.  It may also be related to the Scots and English word nick, which according to the Scots Online Dictionary can refer to a narrow gap in the hills."
"28" "Glug of Stroma:  The word glug is used to describe the sound of water when contained in a vessel.  In Scots the word  glog  can mean to swallow, gulp or gurgle, which surely must be similar in use.  Certainly the Gaelic word suits the context to the channel on Stroma where the sea comes in and can be agitated between the rocks."
"29" "So it appears that in the far north east of the county at least one Gaelic word exists as a place name and at least two other possibilities are there also.  Although it is beyond the focus of this paper, an analysis of sea related place names would make an interesting comparison with the large corpus of work on terrestrial place names.  In another interview, Mr Sutherland pointed out that the sea rocks at Waster, just north of Wick, divided the different languages, with a sea rock to the south being named in Gaelic  (SUTH/5/05, n.d.) .   This is farther north than would be expected by looking at terrestrial names."
"30" "Another interview reviewed in the Scots areas was of a native of Whaligoe  (SUTH/5/063, n.d.) .  This village is widely known owing to the famous steps carved into the cliffs to connect the bay where the boats came  in with the fish curing station on the top of the cliffs.  The interviewee related a lot of tremendously interesting information in many ways, but Gaelic or Gaelic words did not feature in anything she said, other than a few place names containing common elements in Scots speaking areas, such as Braehead and Knockwhin."
"31" "The third interview reviewed to represent a Scots speaking area was of a woman who was native to Wick  (SUTH/5/05, n.d.) .  With respect to this speaker a number of Gaelic terms arose in speech and through questioning by Mr Sutherland who is, as mentioned earlier, also a Wick native and fluent speaker of native Scots.  During the interview it was mentioned that the last Gaelic church  service was in 1833.  The words as they arose in the interview are as follows:"
"32" "Portan: This is an obvious Gaelic borrowing, and was said to be how the Thurso people would say partan which is also used in Scots and derives from Early Irish  (MacBain, 1911) .   It was notable that the interviewee was strongly of the opinion that the word was a French word.  The interviewer pointed out that the word was Gaelic, but she did not accept it."
"33" "Boorag: In context this appeared to be a form of  bùrach , a muddle, or untidy mess."
"34" "Simmans: This is a type of rope called a Sìoman."
"35" "Mirlug: This was said to be the eye of a creel, and is perhaps related to mùrla, which is a type of conical creel (Dwelly)."
"36" "Amatan: A Gaelic word for a silly or foolish person."
"37" "Trosg:  This was described a term of endearment for a naughty but loved child.  This is certainly the use of the word in Rogart."
"38" "Gabag: This was said to be an insult, may be found in Gaelic to describe a sharp or snappish person (Dwelly)."
"39" "Slewan:  This was said to refer to a lazy person.  Perhaps it is related to the Gaelic word,  Slaodaire , describing the same sort of person.  In Rogart usage,  slaodaire , describes a sloppy person who leaves a mess everywhere, but as pronounced in Rogart, “ Slaodair ’”, the vowels are quite different."
"40" "Turning to interviews conducted in formerly Gaelic speaking areas differences are immediately evident.  Firstly, although all speakers had a recognisable Caithness accent they used a standard form of English rather than Scots.  In fact, to my untrained ear they sounded quite Highland in comparison to the style of speech used by the interviewer Mr Sutherland.  It was very interesting to note that with very few exceptions all the speakers were unacquainted with the Scots words Mr Sutherland was asking about, and also that they were weak in Gaelic terms as well.  Their linguistic assimilation was into standard English with little or no trace of their recent Gaelic heritage and even less of Scots."
"41" "The first interview was with three men from the Dunbeath area  (SUTH/5/043, n.d.) .  As with the Scots speakers their interview contained enormous amounts of interesting local information but it was notable that when asked about Scots term s for plants and flowers they did not recognise them at all.  The only word they recognised was  juke , the Scots word for a duck.  The same word in its Gaelic spelling,  diùc , is recorded as the Gaelic term used in Caithness  (Dwelly, 1988) .   This may be one of the rare examples of Scots words taken into Gaelic, or perhaps it an onomatopoeia for the usual call for po ultry, “ tuig tuig ”.  When asked about Gaelic terms they were equally weak, but they did manage a term or two connected with peats, which were  bodach , the first cut peat and then  tarraing  for a the next peat cut.  They had no knowledge however of the Gaelic names for the implements used."
"42" "On the specific topic of Gaelic, they were asked if they knew of or remembered speakers native to the area.  They came up with two, one of whom was the grandfather of one of the men. It was said that he was interviewed by someone from Edinburgh University in 1953.  Another speaker was mentioned, but since his wife didn’t speak Gaelic they said that he only used it with his parents."
"43" "The next interview reviewed was of a man from Forse, which would be expected to be in the formerly Gaelic speaking areas.  (SUTH/5/059, n.d.)   This interview focussed on names of birds.  As with the previous interview the interviewee had n o knowledge of the Scots terms for birds used by Mr Sutherland.  The only exception was the widely used Caithness word  shochad , for a lapwing.  This word derives from Gaelic,  seoc , a plume on a helmet, referring to the feather plume of the bird’s head.  It may be a compound of,  seoc  and  ad  (hat)."
"44" "The final interview reviewed in the formerly Gaelic areas was of a man native to the parish of Reay, on the western border with Sutherland.  (SUTH/5/56, n.d.)    Similar to the other informants the man had little or no knowledge of the Scots term s connected with wildlife and crofting, although he did recognise the word   futterad , meaning a weasel.  In this example the assimilation was to standard English rather than Scots."
"45" "Based on the samples reviewed it seems clear that loanwords from Gaelic may be found in Caithness Scots, but only one loanword  juke/diùc  from Caithness Scots was found in Gaelic.  It may also be said that the residents of the formerly Gaelic speaking areas uniformly spoke standard English, although with a Caithness accent.  Their assimilation was into standard English rather than to Caithness Scots."
"46" "Turning to The Caithness Dictionary, we are presented with lists of words considered to be indicative of Caithness Scots.  Working through the lists it is clear that quite a number of Gaelic words have been incorporated into Scots in Caithness.  The results of working through the lists are as follows (unless referenced otherwise the Gaelic words are from Dwelly):"

"207" "Although a few words in this list maybe disputed, most are obvious Gaelic loanwords.  There has been an obvious borrowing of Gaelic words into Caithness Scots.  To look for evidence of Caithness Scots loanwords in a Gaelic lexis of Caithness Gaelic needs to be investigated.  Fortunately, Dwelly’s Gaelic dictionary is available on-line and it may be searched for those words referenced to Caithness Gaelic speakers.  Very many of these words produced on such a search are referenced to the Reverend Donald Mackenzie, Killimster, Wick, who was a native of Bonar Bridge, Sutherland.  (Curl, 15) ."
"208" "A few of the words are familiar to the author who has heard them used in the Rogart area, and also in the Melness area.  Owing to strong historical connections and especially as a result of Sutherland people moving into Caithness as a result of the Clearances it is unclear which words were recent additions to Caithness Gaelic, and which were longstanding examples of Caithness Gaelic.  In any case, a list is provided of the all the words obtained in Dwelly, with reference to their use in Rogart and to their use on the north coast."
"209" "The use of the words on the north coast was verified by reviewing the list with a speaker in Bettyhill, who also has links with Melness.  (Gòrdon, 2015)   The use of the words in the Rogart area is referenced to the author’ s own family knowledge."

"455" "It may be seem from this list that a number of the words are not confined to Caithness, and also that a high number were unknown. The unknown words may simply be that they are unknown to the informant from Bettyhill and it may be that they were also used outside of Caithness.  Many of the words refer to work involving brewing and milling or a way of life of earlier times and therefore not likely to be in current use.  Specialised vocabulary aside however, overall there does seem to be a continuity of use from the south-east of Sutherland through Caithness and into the north coast."
"456" "In conclusion, the investigation of loanwords between Gaelic and Caithness Scots has shown evidence of quite a number of Gaelic loanwords in Caithness speech.  Interestingly, the borrowing appears to be heavily one way from Gaelic into Caithness Scots and not the other way around.  Very few possible examples of Scots into Gaelic were found, with  juke/diùc  being the sole obvious loan.  Perhaps this is owing to the ample source material on Caithness Scots, and very little material for Caithness Gaelic."
"457" "Aside from the focus of the inquiry in this study, a question arose concerning names associated with the sea.  With respect to terrestrial place names a division may be observed between Gaelic and Norse/English place names, however it may be that names of features at sea may not coincide with the same geographical division."
"458" "The evidence suggests that there was high degree of interaction between the Scots and Gaelic population in Caithness.   It has been noted earlier that Gaelic heritage is not always recognised in the area, despite the historical evidence. It is to be hoped that the linguistic evidence investigated in this study will add to both the historical knowledge and place name evidence so that tolerance and appreciation will result."
