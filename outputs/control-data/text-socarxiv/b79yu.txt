Abstract
This paper presents estimates of short run impacts of a carbon price on the electricity industry using a
cost-minimizing mathematic model of the U.S. market. Prices of $25 and $50 per ton of carbon dioxide
equivalent emissions cause electricity emissions reductions of 17% and 22% from present levels,
respectively. This suggests significant electricity sector emissions reductions can be achieved quickly
from a modest carbon tax. Short run effects refer to operational changes at existing U.S. power plants,
mostly by switching production from coal plants to natural gas plants. The results do not include long
run emissions reductions related to 1) new investments and retirements of electricity production assets,
and 2) demand response as regulated electricity suppliers pass cost changes to retail customers. A statelevel analysis of the results leads to the following conclusions: 1) most emissions reductions come from
high coal-consuming states in the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions, 2) fifteen states increase emissions
because their natural gas consumption offsets coal consumption in neighboring states, and 3) a flat percapita rebate of tax revenue leads to wealth transfers across states.

1. Introduction
Concern about the costs of climate change motivates researchers to research public policy options
intended to reduce greenhouse gases. Implementing a tax on greenhouse gas emissions is one way to
incorporate the costs of emissions into commodity prices and economic decision making. Lawmakers in
the United States (U.S.) are considering a national carbon tax as part of the country’s climate change
strategy. Such a policy would likely cover emissions throughout the entire economy. Several studies
have already considered the effects of carbon policy on the entire economy. The wide coverage in this
studies is done at the expense of more detailed study on individual industries. Electricity production
causes more greenhouse gas emissions than any other sector, so it is important for policymakers to
understand the likely effects of carbon policy on this industry.
Most existing studies on carbon policy consider long term effects decades into the future. Looking far
into the future is important, however near-term impacts can be predicted with more certainty and are
also relevant for policymakers motivated by short-term election cycles. In this paper I address a
literature gap by providing a granular study of the electricity sector and simulate short-run effects of
carbon policy. Throughout the paper I will refer interchangeably to the policy under study as a carbon
tax or a carbon price. I simulate the effects of both a $25/ton and $50/ton price implemented on carbon
dioxide-equivalent (CO2e) emissions from U.S. electricity production. These price levels are consistent
with laws recently proposed by members of the U.S. congress. I build an electricity market model using
publicly available data from the U.S. federal government. All the input data and computer code needed
to replicate this analysis, along with detailed results, are publicly available online at
https://osf.io/59pf6/.
I estimate that in the short run, $25/ton and $50/ton carbon prices will lead to 17% and 22% reductions
in U.S. electric sector greenhouse gas emissions, relative to today. The results suggest that a modest
carbon tax will cause significant electricity sector emissions reductions quickly as producers switch from
coal generation to lower-emitting natural gas generation in competitive electricity markets. The $50/ton
scenario leads to a 59% reduction in electricity production from coal and a 40% increase from natural
gas.
I report carbon policy impacts at the state level, because U.S. law is developed by representatives
elected by citizens from their respective state. Most states experience reduced greenhouse gas
emissions from the policy. Perhaps counterintuitively, the cost-minimizing approach results in some
states increasing emissions after implementing a carbon price. These states increase natural gas
production above local demand to sell to neighboring states who use it to offset coal production. Some
lawmakers have proposed to rebate carbon tax revenues equally to all U.S. citizens. This part of the
policy is designed to cause a progressive income effect and build popular political support. Per capita tax
revenue varies across states, and as a result a flat per capita rebate leads to wealth transfers across
states. Wealth shifts from states that have a relatively high-emitting electricity sector and low
population to states with low-emitting electricity sectors and high populations. Geographically, this
tends to result in wealth transfers from states in the middle of the country to states on the east and
west coasts.
The model assumes electricity producers are economically competitive and cost-minimizing across the
U.S. In reality, the market response would likely be mitigated or slowed down in areas of the country
where these assumptions are not valid. The model holds both the electricity capital stock and demand
levels fixed. These are reasonable short-run assumptions because of, 1) the long lead time required to
2

build a new power plants, and 2) the regulatory mechanisms in place that shield most electricity
consumers from short-run price fluctuations. In this way, the results do not include long run impacts
from the retirement of high-emitting power plants and the construction of lower-emitting plants. The
results also do not include demand response to price changes as the impact of the carbon policy is
passed through to retail customers over time.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: section 2 provides background information and a literature
review relevant for the study. Section 3 discusses the methods, data, model formulation, and validation.
Section 4 presents and discusses results aggregated to the national and regional levels. Section 5
analyzes results at the state level. Section 6 summarizes the key conclusions from the study.

2. Background
Many studies have utilized integrated climate-economy models to study the dynamics between the
natural climate system and human driven economies. Notable examples include Nordhaus, 1993;
Fankhauser, 1994; Tol, 2002; Hope, 2006; and Stern et al., 2007. Tol (2013) provides a summary of this
specific literature, while Zhang et al. (2016) provides a wider review of carbon policy research.
Weitzman (1974) concluded that a price instrument in the form of a tax or a fee is a more efficient policy
to internalize costs from environmental emissions compared to a quantity instrument in the form of a
cap or quota, if reasonable assumptions hold about marginal benefits and costs of emissions abatement.
Subsequent papers considering more complex uncertainties and intertemporal choice associated with
realistic economic decision making have upheld Weitzman’s principal conclusion favoring a tax over a
quantity policy instrument. Newbery (2018) section 2 provides a summary of these studies. The efficient
tax level is equal to the lifetime marginal social cost from an additional unit of emissions.
Integrated climate economy models mentioned in the previous paragraph estimate the social costs of
greenhouse gas emissions. The cost estimates vary widely across studies because they are sensitive to
three uncertain categories of model parameters: 1) the social discount rate 2) the climate-economic
damage function, and 3) the probability distribution of catastrophic climate outcomes. Recently
calculated global lifetime average estimates of present-valued marginal costs range from $6 per ton of
CO2 to $900 per ton of CO2.1 The studies producing these estimates all rely on input parameter levels
reasonable-enough to pass scientific peer-review. Several years ago, a task force reviewed the body of
literature on climate change and economic costs to estimate a marginal social cost of carbon (SCC) to be
used by the U.S. government in cost-benefit analyses of environmental regulation.2 Their effort
established a central SCC value of $21 per ton of CO2, with sensitivity analyses to be conducted at $5,
$35, and $65 in 2007 dollars.
Growing public concern about climate change and the rising costs of greenhouse gas emissions is
motivating the development of public policy to reduce emissions. In 2018 there were four similar but
distinct national, economy-wide carbon price proposals being considered by the U.S. congress.3 The
starting tax values from these proposals ranged between $20 and $50/ton in 2020, motivating the
values considered in this study. Two of these four proposals included flat per capita revenue recycling,

while the others propose using tax revenues to fund environmental government programs and offset
payroll taxes.
Several studies have investigated economic effects of carbon policy. A carbon price will have farreaching economic impacts because many of the materials, final goods, and services that make up
modern economies rely on fossil-fuel based energy inputs. Motivated by these far-reaching economic
impacts, most studies model entire economies in order to understand how a carbon price will affect
economic actors through all stages of production and consumption.4 Recently, Chen and Hafstead
(2018) estimate that an economy-wide U.S. carbon tax stabilizing at $43.40/ton would achieve the 28%
emissions reductions by 2025 necessary to satisfy the U.S.’s commitment to the Paris climate accord.
These economy-wide studies consistently show large impacts on the electricity industry,5 but the
underlying models’ abilities to estimate detailed impacts on the industry are limited by simplifying
assumptions made for computational tractability. This includes treating entire economic sectors, like
consumers, government, or industries, as single aggregated agents with one market-clearing quantity
per year. Implications of heterogeneity within industries generally are not adequately considered.
Taking the electricity sector as an example, the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production in
the U.S. vary across the country. Some regions of the country produce electricity using mostly coal,
while other regions use natural gas and a variety of greenhouse-gas free fuels including nuclear, wind,
solar, and hydro. Furthermore, electricity supply availability and preferences for electricity consumption
vary considerably throughout the day and across seasons.
It is therefore important to conduct granular studies into particular sectors that produce significant
levels of greenhouse gas emissions, or will experience significant impacts from climate change.
Electricity production is the largest single contributing industry to climate change damages, being
responsible for 32% of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 20106. In the United States,
approximately 28% of greenhouse gas emissions come from electricity production7. Other high-impact
and previously-studied sectors include transportation8, agriculture9, manufacturing10, and tourism11.
Most electricity and carbon policy studies have modeled long run effects looking decades into the
future. Several recent studies were published together in a special journal issue of Energy Economics.12 It
is of course important to study the long run effects of proposed policies. However, significant long run
uncertainty exists for variables that influence electricity investment decisions, including capital and fuel
costs. This uncertainty leads to divergent conclusions across studies with similar scopes. For example,
Paul et al. (2015) finds the least-cost electricity industry response to a carbon tax is to significantly
increase natural gas-fired electricity, while Caron et al. (2018) concludes the optimal response to a
comparable tax involves wind energy becoming the dominant source of electricity. Both studies consider
investment decisions 1-2 decades in the future. Mai et al. (2018) shows that methodological differences

across electricity system models leads to significant differences in investment plans over the long run,
even when data inputs are made equal across models.
The short run effects of carbon policy can be estimated with greater precision and granularity. However,
there is a much smaller literature focused on near-term effects in the electricity sector. Voorspools &
D’haeseleer (2006) and Van den Bergh & Delarue (2015) conduct such studies for western Europe, while
Newcomer et al. (2007) looked at a subset of the U.S. The relative short run economics of coal- and gaspowered electricity generation largely determine the first-order effects of a carbon price in the U.S.
electricity sector.13 Within the past decade, the electricity industry in the U.S. has dramatically changed
in ways that have important implications for the impacts of carbon policy. First, natural gas fuel prices in
U.S. dollars per million British Thermal Units (BTU) have decreased from the high-single digits to the low
single-digits. Related to this, electricity generation from natural gas has increased 130%, while
generation from coal has decreased by 40% from 2001-2018.14 Even with this recent transition towards
natural gas, the model suggests a modest carbon policy will cause a significant additional shift to natural
gas for electricity production.
This study provides an updated assessment of the short run effects of carbon policy on the U.S.
electricity sector. It is a timely contribution given the growing discussions around carbon policy in the
U.S. congress, and large role the electricity sector has in climate change mitigation efforts.

Model overview

To study the short run effects of carbon policy I build an electricity market optimization and simulation
model. The model solves for hourly least-cost electricity production levels across the U.S. given available
power plants, transmission capacity and operational constraints. I separate the U.S. into 10 regions that
approximate existing electricity market boundaries, shown in Figure 1. Power plants are dispatched to
meet hourly demand for each market region. Imports and exports between regions are allowed, and are
constrained to approximate existing transmission capabilities between markets. Power plants are
dispatched to satisfy exogenously-provided and inelastic hourly demand. Assuming inelastic demand
eases computation. Furthermore, it is a reasonable assumption consistent with empirical evidence15
because in the short-run most electricity consumers do not see changes in the spot electricity price.
Incentive-based demand response resources are sometimes administratively deployed in real-time
electricity auction markets.16 However, these events rarely occur and as a result have minimal impact on
the overall elasticity of electricity demand.

Figure 1 Electricity market regions defined in the model.
I assume no transmission congestion within market regions. This is partly because the U.S. lacks a quality
source of public data on sub-regional electric transmission lines. Abstracting from local transmission
congestion also improves the model’s computational tractability. I avoid using integer constraints in the
model to ease the computational burden. This involves abstracting from non-linear components of
power plant operations decisions, including start-up and shut-down costs, and minimum run times.
Both local transmission congestion and non-linear operational constraints can have significant
implications on any given power plant’s production schedules. For this reason, I do not emphasize plantlevel results.
Despite these simplifying assumptions, aggregated results from the model provide useful insights to
policymakers at the national, regional, and state levels. The baseline scenario replicates aggregate levels
of recently observed emissions, transmission levels, market prices, and generation reasonably well.
Details from a baseline model validation exercise are discussed in section 3.5. At the state level, Mann et
al. (2017) analyzed results from an electricity market model that similarly abstracts from transmission
and non-linear power plant constraints for the state of Texas. They compared their results with highly
detailed commercial models that incorporate local transmission and power plant level operational
constraints. Consistent with my modeling approach, they found consistent results for aggregated
outputs at the state level.
The carbon price is simulated as an increase in plant-level marginal costs proportional to each power
plant’s recently observed CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions rate. After implementing the carbon price,
the optimization algorithm re-orders regional supply curves in order of marginal costs. This is illustrated
in Figure 2, which presents supply curves for all U.S. electricity generation with and without a carbon
price. A carbon price shifts emitting electric generators up. The non-emitting forms of generation,
including wind, solar, and hydro, do not shift vertically. The carbon price also shifts many natural gas
power plants to the left, represented as the green portions of the curve, while shifting coal plants to the
right, represented in red. This results from the cost-minimizing optimization that occurs after the policy
6

is implemented as coal plants become relatively more expensive. Coal plants have higher emissions
intensities than natural gas and have to pay a higher carbon tax for every unit of electricity produced.
Natural gas combined cycle plants emit 60% less greenhouse gases per unit than coal plants. Specifically,
capacity-weighted average CO2e emissions rates for U.S. power plants are approximately 2,194
lbs/MWh for coal and 899 lbs/MWh for natural gas combined cycle.17 This explains why the primary
mechanism through which a carbon price causes emissions reductions in the short run is from replacing
coal generation with natural gas.

Figure 2 Short-run U.S. electricity supply curve estimates with and without a carbon tax.
The electricity market model assumes competitive, cost-minimizing suppliers and inelastic demand.
Theoretical and empirical evidence suggests these two characteristics of the market model will result in
100% pass through of the emissions tax to consumers. Sijm et al. (2012) describes in detail the economic
theory on emissions pass through in electricity markets. In summary, consumers will purchase the same
quantity of electricity no matter the price, because they are shielded from price changes in the short
run. Competitive supply results in suppliers offering to sell electricity at their marginal production costs.
When a tax is added to suppliers’ marginal costs, the full additional cost is reflected in their new offers,
and consumers accept the associated price increase without any demand reduction. If electricity market
structures in the U.S. deviate from this model, it will tend to reduce the level of pass through to the
electricity price. For instance, a market characterized by oligopoly supply and inelastic demand will have

lower pass-through because profit-maximizing firms’ marginal revenue functions are steeper than the
demand curve. Consistent with the market structure underlying this model, Sijm et al. (2006) found high
levels of carbon price pass through into electricity prices in Europe. Woo et al. (2017) also find relatively
high (but not 100%) carbon cost pass through rates in California. They note their results are influenced
by market distortions related to trading and leakage with neighboring markets not covered by the
state’s carbon policy.

Algebraic model formulation

This section presents an algebraic formulation of the electricity market model. The model utilizes the
following parameters:
𝑄𝑝,𝑚
𝑐𝑝,𝑡

maximum operating capacity of plant 𝑝 during month 𝑚 in megawatts (𝑀𝑊)
production cost of plant 𝑝 in hour 𝑡, in dollars per megawatt-hour ($/𝑀𝑊ℎ)

𝐶𝑂2𝑝

carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions rate for plant 𝑝, in

𝐷𝑟,𝑡
𝑂𝑟,𝑡
𝑡𝑥𝑟′ ,𝑟
𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑟,𝑚
𝑓𝑒𝑒

demand in market region 𝑟 during hour 𝑡, in 𝑀𝑊ℎ
hourly operating reserves in region 𝑟, in 𝑀𝑊ℎ
transmission capacity limit from region 𝑟 ′ to region 𝑟, measured in 𝑀𝑊ℎ
average net international imports into market region 𝑟 for month 𝑚
carbon price imposed by policy, in $/𝑀𝑊ℎ

𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑠 𝐶𝑂2 𝑒
𝑀𝑊ℎ

The set of choice variables are the levels of hourly production from each plant, 𝑞𝑝,𝑡 , and the levels of
power transferred between each market region, 𝑞𝑡𝑥𝑟′ ,𝑟,𝑡 , in MWh. Each market region coordinates to
minimize the cost of dispatching power plants across the entire United States, subject to capacity
constraints and demand levels. In this way, the optimization problem is algebraically formulated as
follows:
minimize ∑𝑟 ∑𝑝∈𝑟 ∑𝑡 𝑞𝑝,𝑡 (𝑐𝑝,𝑡 + 𝐶𝑂2𝑝 𝑓𝑒𝑒) , ∀ 𝑡

𝑞𝑝,𝑡 , 𝑞𝑡𝑥𝑟′,𝑟,𝑡

(1)

Subject to the following constraints:
∑ 𝑞𝑝∈𝑟,𝑡 + ∑ (𝑞𝑡𝑥𝑟′ ,𝑟,𝑡 − 𝑞𝑡𝑥𝑟,𝑟′ ,𝑡 ) + 𝑖𝑚𝑝𝑟,𝑚 ≥ 𝐷𝑟,𝑡 + 𝑂𝑟,𝑡 , ∀ 𝑟, 𝑚, 𝑡 ∈ 𝑚
𝑝∈𝑟

(2)

𝑟 ′ ≠𝑟

0 ≤ 𝑞𝑝,𝑡 ≤ 𝑄𝑝,𝑚 , ∀ 𝑝, 𝑚, 𝑡 ∈ 𝑚

(3)

−𝑡𝑥𝑟′ ,𝑟 ≤ 𝑞𝑡𝑥𝑟′ ,𝑟,𝑡 ≤ 𝑡𝑥𝑟′ ,𝑟 , ∀ 𝑟, 𝑟 ′ ≠ 𝑟, 𝑡

(4)

The objective function in equation (1) chooses hourly plant production and regional transmission flows
to minimize production costs, including the carbon price. Equation (2) requires that production plus net
imports from all other regions meets demand plus operating reserves in region 𝑟, for all hours. Equation
(3)0 limits production from each plant to be less than or equal to its total capacity and non-negative.
Equation (4) limits energy transfers across market regions to the available transmission capacity. Prices
in the model are equal to the production cost of the marginal power plant for each hour in each market
region. This is equivalent to the increase in system production cost if demand increased by one unit. In
in mathematic optimization terminology, this is the Lagrange multiplier of the demand constraints
(equation (2)).

Data

The data used to construct the model are all publicly available and mostly downloaded from U.S.
government websites. Power plant capacity limits (𝑄𝑝,𝑚 ) were obtained from the U.S. Energy
Information Administration’s (US EIA) survey form 860.18 For the purpose of reporting aggregated
results, each plant is assigned to one of 11 electric generation technology categories.19 To incorporate
the probability of power plants going offline for maintenance or unanticipated outages, capacity limits
were discounted by corresponding average outage rates reported by the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation (NERC).20
Capacity limits for wind and solar were determined from recently-observed average monthly output
levels, calculated using US EIA historic generation data from form 923.21 These capacity limits adjust by
month to capture seasonal variation in wind and solar outputs. Solar plants are allowed to generate
during the day, and turn off at night. Hydro plant operators face complicated dispatch decisions that
vary by year and season according to reservoir storage levels. Rather than attempt to incorporate this
behavior in the model, hydro capacity limits are also set to recently-observed average output levels.
While electricity markets experience variation in renewable energy output on any given day, Wan (2012)
presents empiric data from across the U.S. showing aggregated average wind outputs are fairly stable
over 24-hour daily cycles. Furthermore, wind, solar and hydro plants rarely operate on the margin today
and their daily dispatch levels would be relatively unaffected by a carbon policy. For these reasons,
abstracting from hourly wind and solar variability and hydro dispatch decisions do not materially impact
the aggregated estimates presented in sections 4 and 5.
Electricity production costs (𝑐𝑝,𝑡 ) include the cost of fuel, operations, maintenance, and emissions. US
EIA survey form 923 also reports monthly, generator-level fuel costs for fossil-fueled plants. Aggregated
statistics of fuel costs for the remaining technologies and operations and maintenance (O&M) costs for
all technologies were gathered from the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)’s Annual
Technology Baseline dataset. 22 Plants that are located in California or the Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative in the northeastern U.S. have greenhouse gas emissions costs in the baseline scenario. These
existing carbon costs were obtained from The World Bank (2019). Recently observed electricity demand
levels (𝐷𝑟,𝑡 ) and regional transmission flows from the US EIA’s electric system operating data were
used.23 Public data on transmission capacity (𝑡𝑥𝑟′ ,𝑟 ) is not available. Instead, capacity levels were set to
recently observed average transmission flows. International trade of electricity into and out of markets
is exogenous to the model, and determined by monthly-averaged flows across the Canadian and
Mexican borders. Some market regions rely on significant levels of imports. Annually-averaged
international net import levels into the New England and New York are approximately 10% and 6% of
annual peak demand, respectively.

Operating reserves (𝑂𝑟,𝑡 ) are included to reflect uncertainty in electricity demand and generation
output. They are set to equal 3% of demand plus 5% of average wind and solar output for each region
and hour. This “3+5” heuristic was determined by GE & NREL (2010) to perform well for temporallygranular electricity market models. Power plant emissions rates (𝐶𝑂2𝑝 ) were calculated using recently
observed plant-level emissions data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).24 US EPA
reports CO2-equivalent (CO2e) emissions rates. This measurement standardize and incorporate the
global warming potentials of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) released
by power plants, in addition to CO2. However, approximately 98% of total U.S. electricity CO2e emissions
are CO2.25

Model construction and solution procedure

The model was solved as a set of linear programs using the open-sourced LPSolve software. LPSolve is a
revised simplex linear program solver.26 I access the solver using a wrapper function in R.27 R is a free,
open-sourced, object-oriented programming language and computing environment.28 It would be
straightforward for a researcher to code this model in other modern object-oriented numeric computing
environments such as Python or Matlab. To understand how the model is coded and solved it is useful
to think like the computer in terms of matrices and vectors. Therefore, in this section I supplement the
algebraic model formulation in section 3.2 with a more detailed description of the model using matrix
and vector notation. I solve the model as a single linear program for each hour, so each vector and
matrix is indexed by hour 𝑡 (for example, 𝒙𝑡 ). Consistent with the model description from section 3.1,
some data objects vary hourly (production costs 𝑐𝑡 , and demand 𝐷𝑡 ), some vary monthly (plant capacity
constraints 𝑄𝑚 ), and others do not vary at all (transmission capacity limits 𝑡𝑥 and the constraint
coefficient matrix 𝐴). All the subscripts needed describe how the model objects vary across time were
already provided in section 3.2. The time subscripts for data objects are omitted from the following
description to reduce clutter.
The linear program problem is solved in the following standard format:

Where 𝒙 is the vector of choice variables, 𝒄 is the vector of objective function coefficients, 𝑨 is the

the vector of power plant production decisions 𝒒 plus transmission levels 𝒒𝒕𝒙. There are 𝑃 = 8,377
power plants. There are also 𝑇𝑋 = 90 possible transmission connections between market regions,
because each of the 10 regions has 9 possible trading partners. Several pairs of market regions do not
have any physical connections between them, in which case the associated transmission capacity 𝑡𝑥𝑟′ ,𝑟
is constrained to be zero. As a result, 𝒙 has 𝑃 + 𝑇𝑋 = 8,467 non-negative elements (8,377 + 90), and is
arranged as follows:
𝒙 = {𝒒, 𝒒𝒕𝒙} ∈ ℝ𝑛+ , 𝑛 = 𝑃 + 𝑇𝑋

The vector 𝒄 ∈ ℝ𝑛+ includes 𝑃 plant-level variable production costs, followed by 𝑇𝑋 transmission costs,
in $/MWh. Production costs for each plant include fuel costs, variable operations and maintenance
costs, and baseline carbon costs for plants in the California and RGGI regions. Carbon prices are added
to the elements in 𝒄 for the carbon policy scenarios. I assume transmission costs are equal across all
market regions, but future applications could explore implications of modeling heterogeneous
transmission costs between regions.
The vector 𝒃 ∈ ℝ𝑚
+ includes the right-hand-side values of all the constraints. The first 𝑃 elements
represent the capacity constraints for each plant 𝑸, followed by 𝑇𝑋 transmission capacity constraints
𝒕𝒙. This is then followed by 𝑅 = 10 demand constraints 𝑫, which equal demand levels plus operating
reserves minus international imports for each market region. Thus, 𝒃 has 𝑚 = 8,477 elements
(8,377 + 90 + 10), and is arranged as follows:
𝒃 = {𝑸, 𝒕𝒙, 𝑫} ∈ ℝ𝑚
+ , 𝑚 = 𝑃 + 𝑇𝑋 + 𝑅

(7)

The matrix 𝑨 ∈ ℝ𝑚×𝑛
includes the constraint coefficients, with each of the 𝑚 rows representing a
+
constraint. To explain the construction of this constraint coefficient matrix, it useful to separate it into
the block matrix shown in Figure 3. The dimensions for each of the six submatrices are described along
the outside. The first 𝑃 = 8,377 rows in 𝑨 correspond to the plant capacity constraints in vector 𝒃. They
are constructed by column-binding an identity matrix (𝑰) of order 𝑃 with a zero matrix (𝟎) of dimension
𝑃 × 𝑇𝑋. The following 𝑇𝑋 = 90 rows correspond to the 90 transmission constraints that follow in 𝒃.
This is constructed by column-binding a 𝑇𝑋 × 𝑃 zero matrix with an identify matrix of order 𝑇𝑋.

Figure 3 Layout of constraint matrix A. Capital letters on the outside describe the matrix dimensions.
The final 𝑅 = 10 rows in Figure 3 correspond to the demand constraints, one for each market region.
Within these final rows, the 𝑅 × 𝑃 submatrix 𝑫 is built by assigning 1 to each element whose column 𝑝
corresponds to a plant in the region corresponding to row 𝑟 (∀𝑝 ∈ 𝑟). Furthermore, the 𝑅 × 𝑇𝑋
submatrix 𝑻 is built by assigning 1 to each element whose column 𝑡𝑥 represents a transmission flow into
the region corresponding with row 𝑟 (∀𝑡𝑥 ∈ 𝑟). In this way, the elements are assigned according to
equation set (8).

This ensures that for each hour, the elements of 𝒙 are chosen such that the sum of all plants and
transmission imports meets demand for each market region.

equal to “≤” while the last 𝑅 elements are equal to “≥”.

Baseline scenario

A baseline scenario without a national carbon policy was solved, and the model was validated by
comparing the outputs to recently observed data. Model-estimated annual CO2e emissions from
electricity production in this baseline scenario were 1.62 billion metric tons. The US EPA-reported CO2e
emissions from the power sector in 2017 were 1.78 billion.29 This difference stems from the fact that the
EPA’s greenhouse gas inventory includes all stationary combustion emissions related to the generation
of electricity. US EIA’s form 860, the dataset providing the power plants used in the model, covers
electric power plants with 1 megawatt (MW) or greater of combined nameplate capacity. Greenhouse
gas emissions from small electric generators will show up in EPA’s inventory but not in the model data.
Model-estimated electricity prices were compared with recently observed prices in market regions that
report such data.30 This comparison is reported in Table 1. Modeled prices closely match observed
prices, except for divergences in California and New England. In these two regions, modeled prices are
significantly higher than what has been recently observed. This is likely because California and New
England have high levels of low-cost distributed electricity generation that are not picked up by the
datasets used to build the model. For example, California and New Jersey have the highest levels of
electricity production from small-scale solar plants less than 1 megawatt in nameplate capacity.31 Again,
US EIA’s form 860 dataset covers electric power plants larger than 1 MW of combined nameplate
capacity, so these distributed generators are not included in the model. Incorporating distributed
generation would result in a rightward shift of the supply curves (or leftward shift in net demand curves)
for these two regions, lowering equilibrium prices. Fortunately, the short-run relative economics
between natural gas and coal plants after a carbon price that underly the results of this study are not
significantly impacted by these factors that likely drive price divergence in California and New England.

Next, modeled generation levels for dispatchable technologies were aggregated by fuel type and
compared to aggregate observed generation levels reported in the EIA form 923 dataset. Modeled

the model slightly under-predicts coal generation compared to the observed level. In the model, a

significant fraction of coal units are ramped down on a daily basis during low-demand hours when they
are not economically competitive. Cost-competitive combined cycle natural gas plants replace the coal
generation that ramps down. Figure 4 plots modeled electricity production by fuel source for one week
and a full year, and shows the daily cycling dynamics of these two fuel sources. This daily cycling may not
be happening in reality due to non-competitive market conditions and generator ramping costs not
considered in the model. For example, in some markets it is relatively common for coal plants to self
schedule and produce even if their offer exceeds the system marginal cost. During these periods, wind
and solar may be curtailed instead of coal if supply exceeds demand.
Table 2 also shows modeled production from natural gas combustion turbine plants is less than recently
observed levels. Combustion turbines are primarily dispatched during periods with high market prices
and tight supply conditions. This is because the largely deterministic model under-predicts unplanned
contingencies which in reality cause high prices. These include for example the unexpected loss of a
large generator or transmission line.

As discussed in section 3.3 and shown in Figure 4, wind, solar, and hydro are modeled by setting
production equal to each plant’s recently observed output level. This approach results in accurate
aggregate levels of wind and solar production, while abstracting from the complicated, weather-driven
hourly variation characteristic of wind and solar production profiles and seasonal, reservoir-driven
production of hydro. Profit-maximizing owners of these technologies will offer to sell in a competitive
electricity market at close to zero dollars because they don’t have fuel costs and have low marginal
production costs. As a result, these power plants are rarely on the margin, and the operator’s decision
to schedule cost-effective wind, solar, and hydro electricity will not change in the short run due to a
carbon price. Rather, the majority of short-run effects from the carbon price come from relative changes
in production costs from coal and natural gas combined cycle generation. Combined cycle natural gas
generation replaces coal generation on the margin after a carbon price because it has a lower
greenhouse gas emissions intensity.
The overall results from this model validation exercise provide confidence in the results. Electricity
prices predicted by the model match recently observed electricity prices for most regions where data is
available. The modeled prices deviate from observed levels in California and New England due to
operational dynamics not captured by the model. There are also relatively small deviations between coal
and natural gas generation predicted by the model and in reality, explained by non-competitive market
conditions that are not modeled. The changes in short-run relative economics between coal and natural
gas from a carbon policy is the most important factor driving the short-run effects. If one can accept the
reasonable assumption that effects from these operational and non-competitive dynamics remain
constant for a short period of time after a carbon price is implemented,32 then the overall implications
of these deviations on the quality of results are minor.

4. Results
The model predicts short-run decreases in annual electricity sector CO2e emissions from current levels
of 17% from a $25/ton carbon tax and 22% from a $50/ton carbon price. The emissions levels for the
three modeled scenarios are displayed in Table 3. There were 5.7 billion total tons of U.S. CO2e
greenhouse gas emissions emitted in 2017.33 These electricity emissions reductions are equivalent to a
4.9% and 6.3% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions reductions, holding emissions from all other
industries constant. The short-run electricity emissions reductions from a $50/ton tax make up
approximately 21% of the U.S.’s voluntary 2025 greenhouse gas reduction commitment under the Paris
Climate Accord.34 These calculations are presented visually in Figure 5. The short-run electricity
greenhouse gas emissions reductions estimates come from operational changes to the existing capital
stock. They do not include additional long run emissions reductions caused by new investments in lowcarbon electricity production and retirements of high-carbon electricity production assets caused by the
policy.

32

This type of assumption is commonly invoked when attempting to understand and model economic phenomena.
It is often referred to by the Latin phrase “ceteris paribus”, translated to “holding all else constant.”

Figure 5 Short-run electricity industry emissions reductions from electricity carbon tax, relative to the
total U.S. emissions reduction commitment for the Paris Climate Accord.
These results suggest significant short-run emissions reductions can be achieved from a U.S. carbon
price on the electricity sector. The tax on these emissions generated $33.5 billion in government
revenue in the $25/ton scenario, and $63.0 billion in the $50/ton scenario.
Almost all of the short-run emissions reductions come from changing electricity-sector consumption
between coal and natural gas. As discussed in section 3.4, this is because most marginal electricity
production in the U.S. is produced from one of these fuels. A carbon price will have a relatively large,
immediate effect on the short-run marginal costs of coal and natural gas power plants. Table 4 displays
total generation from coal and natural gas generation in each of the three scenarios. It shows that the
model estimates a 43% short-run reduction in U.S. coal generation from a $25/ton carbon price, and a
59% reduction from a $50/ton price. Much of this is offset by increased natural gas generation of 30%
and 40% in the two scenarios, respectively.

The results suggest a carbon price will have significant short run price effects in wholesale markets. The
largest price impacts are located in coal-heavy markets including the Central, Mid-Atlantic, and Midwest
regions. Table 5 presents average prices by scenario broken out by market region, while the last column
displays the change in price after implementing a $50/ton price. The price impacts are qualified by the
fact that these are first-order effect estimates derived from short-run supply-side adjustments to the
carbon tax. In the electricity industry, most customers are insulated from short run price changes
through long run contracts and regulator-approved prices. These price increases will eventually be offset
15

by downward pressure from reduced demand and new investments in electricity supply, both of which
are second-order effects not considered in this model.

Table 5 Average annual prices ($/MWh) by region for baseline and carbon tax scenarios. The last column
presents the difference between $50/ton and baseline scenarios. United States prices are the average of
all regions weighted by annual electricity consumption.
Transmission flows adjust so that regions which experience relatively larger increases in marginal
production costs after the carbon price import more energy from less-affected regions. Table 6 presents
average transmission flows across regions in the baseline and $50/ton scenarios. The most striking
impact is in the Northwest region. Electricity trade from the Northwest to California dropped to
approximately one-third of the baseline level, offset by a trade reversal from California and the
Southwest region. Ample transmission capacity between these three regions, along with relatively more
cost-competitive natural gas capacity across the Western U.S. after the carbon price, resulted in the
Northwest drastically reducing coal generation after a $50/ton carbon price to one-fifth of its baseline
level. These results are qualified by the fact that there are hydroelectric production constraints that are
not modeled that determine in part the regional trade levels across the west. Furthermore, there are
market structures and contractual relationships across the west and other regions that are not modeled
but tend to reinforce status quo levels of regional trade in the short-run.35

5. State-level results
Implementing a national carbon price in the U.S. would most likely occur after political negotiation and
compromise among state representatives in the U.S. congress. Understanding state-level impacts is an
important political economy component for the prospects of carbon policy. In this section I analyze
estimated state-level impacts on emissions, generation, costs, and tax revenue. Table 7 at the end of
this section displays a comprehensive set of model results for each state for the $25/ton and $50/ton
scenarios. I describe the state-level results in Table 7 more fully with multiple references throughout this
section.
Figure 6 maps changes in CO2e emissions by state after simulating a $50/ton tax. These correspond to
the “CO2e” columns in Table 7. Most net emissions reductions at the state level occur in coal-heavy
states that are part of large regional markets, including West Virginia, Ohio, and Kentucky. These states
reduce coal production and replace it with lower-carbon electricity production from neighboring states.
Perhaps surprisingly to some state policymakers, the national cost-minimizing response to a federal
carbon price involves increasing emissions in some states, including but not limited to California, Florida,
and Louisiana. These state-level net emissions increases occur in states that are increasing natural gas
production to offset coal reductions in neighboring states. This can be seen more explicitly in Figure 7,
which maps state-level changes in coal and natural gas generation (the “Coal” and “Gas” columns in
Table 7). For example, West Virginia has a relatively large coal decrease and small natural gas increase.
On the other hand, California increases natural gas generation but does not increase coal because the
state has near zero coal generation to begin with.

17

These state-level insights are qualified by the fact that I model transmission constraints across market
regions but not within regions. State policymakers should consider the possibility of intra-region
transmission constraints before accepting the full magnitude of these results. For example, modeled
natural gas plants in Florida increase substantially to offset coal reductions elsewhere in the Southeast
region. In reality, some natural gas plants in south Florida may find difficulty accessing transmission
capacity to serve demand elsewhere in the southeastern U.S.
Texas presents an interesting example. The state little transmission capacity with neighboring markets.
As a result, almost all fuel switching occur within the state. Due to its lack of transmission
interconnection and the large size of its electricity market, Texas both decreases coal and increases
natural gas more than any other state in response to a carbon price.

Figure 6 Change in CO2e emissions by state after $50/ton tax.

18

Figure 7 Decrease in coal generation (top) and increase in natural gas generation (bottom) from $50/ton
carbon tax.
Examining changes in electricity production costs by state provides additional insights into the effects of
carbon policy. Production costs include the fuel, operations, maintenance, and emissions costs needed
to produce electricity. They are equal to the area under the electricity supply curve, including for
example the curves previously displayed in Figure 2. State production costs decrease when coal
generation decreases, and increase when natural gas generation increases. These production costs
should not be interpreted as net costs to society from the policy. Rather, they provide insights into the
magnitude of shifts in generation between fuel types and across states. As described in more detail in
section 3, the model assumes suppliers minimize costs and sell in a competitive market. As a result, they
would not incur production costs if there were not adequate revenue and profits available when selling
their electricity in the market.
Figure 8 plots the change in production costs by state on the vertical axis as a result of a $50/ton price.
The horizontal axis displays the state’s reduction in CO2e emissions from a $50/ton price. The width of
each bar is proportional to the magnitude of emissions reduction. States that increase emissions are
located to the left of zero on the horizontal axis, while states to the right of zero reduced emissions.
State-level production cost changes correspond to the “Cost” columns in Table 7. Figure 8 shows a few
interesting results. All states to the left of the origin increased emissions after a carbon tax, because
they increased natural gas generation after a carbon price to serve demand in neighboring states.
Montana experienced a net decrease in electricity production costs after a $50/ton carbon tax, even
though all emitting electricity production became more expensive. This occurred because the in-state
19

coal producers decreased production while out-of-state electricity producers increased generation to
make up the deficit. Both Florida and Texas had large increases in natural gas generation, leading to
their relatively large production costs increases.

Figure 8 Emissions reduction and change in electricity production cost by state for $50/ton scenario.
Almost all states generate federal government revenue from a carbon tax. Tax revenue collected from
the electricity sector by state is displayed in the “Tax” columns in Table 7. The highest revenuegenerating states in the $50/ton scenario are Texas, Florida, and California at 7.0, 4.6, and 3.3 billion
dollars per year, respectively. The revenue raised by a carbon tax could be rebated as an equal lump
sum to all U.S. citizens. This policy proposal is motivated by income inequality concerns and the desire to
make a carbon tax revenue neutral. The $63 billion raised from the electricity industry in the $50/ton
scenario would result in approximately $194 per person per year if the rebate proposal were
implemented.
A flat rebate combined with heterogeneous tax revenue on a per capita basis across states results in a
wealth transfer across states. Two of the four recent carbon tax proposals mentioned in section 2 do
this, while a third indirectly recycles revenues to citizens via a payroll tax reduction. States with high
populations and/or low-emitting electricity are likely to pay less in carbon taxes than this average
rebate. In the $50/ton scenario, all U.S. citizens receive a $194 rebate per year. However, residents of
California and New York pay $82 and $62 carbon tax per person, respectively, while residents of West
Virginia pay $1,077 per person. State population data for 2018 from the U.S. Census Bureau were used
in these calculations.36 Figure 9 displays taxes per person for the $50/ton scenario, and is color-coded to
highlight the wealth transfer across states. On the color scale, the flat rebate of $194 is set to white.
States that pay less than $194 in per capita carbon tax are on the green end of the spectrum, while
states that pay more than $194 per capita are on the red side. In general, Figure 9 shows that a flat per

6. Conclusions
This paper presents results from an electricity market model built to estimate short run effects of a
national carbon price on the U.S. electricity industry. The results suggest that a modest carbon tax can
cause significant short run greenhouse gas emissions reductions from the U.S. electricity sector. The
model estimates a $25/ton tax leads to 17% emissions reductions and a $50/ton tax leads to 22%
reductions from today’s levels of electricity emissions. These are equivalent to approximately 4.9% and
6.3% reductions from present economy-wide greenhouse gas emissions. The estimated emissions
reductions from a $50/ton electricity industry carbon tax represent 21% of the U.S.’s 2025 voluntary
commitment under the Paris Climate Accord, holding emissions from all other industries constant.
The electricity market model captures short-run operational changes to existing power plants as a result
of the carbon price. The majority of emissions reductions quantified come from decreased coal
consumption and increased natural gas consumption. The model keeps the electricity capital stock fixed,
and results do not include additional long-run emissions reductions that will occur from a carbon tax due
to increased investments in low carbon-emitting production and increased retirements in high-carbon
emitting power plants. The model assumes inelastic, exogenous demand and does not capture long-run
emissions reductions from demand reductions. Demand response is considered a long-run dynamic
because the short run elasticity of electricity demand is very low, and most electric utilities in the U.S.
pass changes in costs through to customers over periods of several years.
I consider a scenario in which carbon tax revenues are rebated on a flat per capita basis to all U.S.
citizens. Short run electricity carbon tax revenues in a $50/ton scenario raise approximately $194 per
citizen. Flat per capita revenue rebates are included in recent carbon tax proposals put forth by U.S.
lawmakers. This is done so the policy will have a progressive income effect and have wide support
among the U.S. populace. An electricity carbon tax is characterized by heterogeneous per capita tax
revenue across states. As a result, a flat per capita rebate will cause a transfer of wealth from electricity
consumers in high revenue per capita states to low revenue per capita states. These results are mapped
in Figure 9, and in general involve transfers from relatively high-emitting, low-population states in the
middle of the country to low-emitting, high-population states on the east and west coasts.
Most emissions reductions come from states that consume large amounts of coal in the Mid-Atlantic,
Midwest, and Western U.S. The leading emissions-reducing states include West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky,
Wyoming, and Indiana. The cost-minimizing response to a carbon tax involves increased emissions from
a few states. These states increase natural gas consumption to export electricity to and replace coal
consumption in neighboring states. This happens because of the regionally-interconnected nature of the
U.S. electricity grid. States that increase emissions in response to the carbon policy do so to enable a
larger amount of lower-cost emissions reductions from their neighbors. If were not allowed, states that
consume large amounts of coal would achieve less emissions reductions, and the country would achieve
less emissions reductions overall and experience higher costs from the carbon policy.
