Abstract
School belonging is linked with socioemotional wellbeing and academic achievement,
but an important question is whether school belonging or its effects vary for college or university
students of minority identities. A number of outcomes associated with school belonging,
including positive social relationships, perceptions of a fulfilling life, self-respect, optimism, and
self-efficacy, are interlinked by the concept of socioemotional flourishing. This study aimed to
assess the age-varying prevalence of and association between school belonging and flourishing
among sexual or gender minority (SGM) and racial or ethnic minority (REM) students compared
with non-minority students in the U.S. higher education setting. Data were drawn from a large
national survey of U.S. college and university students ages 18–26, and were examined using
varying-coefficient models to estimate the relation of school belonging and flourishing as a
continuous function of age. SGM students (! = 6,718) had significantly lower belonging and
flourishing than cisgender heterosexual students (! = 19,492) across all age points, and
compared to white students (! = 16,444), REM students (! = 10,539) endorsed significantly
lower belonging and flourishing at several age points. The association of belonging with
flourishing was found to be significantly greater for SGM students than for cisgender
heterosexual students across all ages, while age-varying associations for REM and white students
were more complex. Findings of this study underline the unique importance and magnitude of
the role of school belonging in socioemotional flourishing for SGM young adults, and highlight
potential avenues for prevention of negative psychosocial and substance use outcomes among
both SGM and REM college and university students.
Keywords: school belonging, minority health, sexual or gender minority, racial or ethnic
minority, flourishing.

Differences in the Age-varying Association of School Belonging with Socioemotional
Flourishing among Minority and Non-minority College and University Students
School belonging reflects connectedness to, and acceptance by, a school community, and
among college and university-attending young adults, greater school belonging has been linked
with higher academic performance, enhanced self-worth and perceived social acceptance, and
reduced depression and loneliness (Freeman, Anderman, & Jensen, 2007; Goodenow, 1993;
Gummadam, Pittman, & Ioffe, 2016; Hagerty, Williams, Coyne, & Early, 1996; Pittman &
Richmond, 2007, 2008; Zumbrunn, McKim, Buhs, & Hawley, 2014). Importantly, school
belonging is not limited to interpersonal, relational belonging (i.e., one’s sense of closeness to
individuals or groups), but has been described as a broader attachment to a school environment
that involves meaningful connection with peers and faculty, fulfilling engagement with academic
and extracurricular groups, identification with university culture and norms of inclusion and
diversity, and the presence of intrapersonal factors such as intrinsic motivation toward social
connection, interest in opportunities for personal growth, and perceived balance of social and
academic pursuits (Gummadam et al., 2016; Slaten et al., 2014).
Given the association of school belonging with wellbeing and achievement during early
adulthood, an important question is whether school belonging or its effects vary for college or
university students (hereafter referred to as college students) of minority identities, in particular
those groups that have experienced disparities in academic and psychosocial outcomes in the
college and university setting (Smith, Chesin, & Jeglic, 2014). A small number of studies have
investigated disparities in school belonging or related outcomes among sexual or gender minority
(SGM) and racial or ethnic minority (REM) older adolescents and college students, and found
they experience different levels or effects of school belonging compared to non-minorities

(Gummadam et al., 2016; Hatchel, Merrin, & Espelage, 2019; Rostosky, Owens, Zimmerman, &
Riggle, 2003). Specifically, older sexual minority adolescents (aged 14–18 years) report
significantly lower perceived school belonging compared with heterosexual youth, and among
SGM adolescents, lower school belonging is associated with substance use and low selfcompassion (Hatchel et al., 2019; Rostosky et al., 2003). Similarly, among REM college
students, depression, low self-worth, and low academic competence are associated with lower
perceived school belonging (Gummadam et al., 2016). Moreover, potential mediating roles of
school belonging have been identified in minority populations. For instance, a study by Mounts
(2004) found a significant indirect effect of school belonging in the relation between campus
racial climate and psychological adjustment outcomes (e.g., depression and substance misuse)
among African American college students, suggesting that higher levels of belonging may blunt
the effect of hostel school racial climate.
A number of outcomes associated with school belonging, including positive social
relationships, perceptions of a fulfilling life, self-respect, optimism, and self-efficacy, are
interlinked by the concept of flourishing (Diener et al., 2010; Keyes, 2007). Flourishing is a
multidimensional construct, and is viewed as a metric of socioemotional well-being and
psychosocial competency that extends beyond subjective well-being (Diener et al., 2010).
Flourishing has been alternatively described as the realization of both high social capital and
high psychological capital, and dimensions of flourishing have been examined as indicators of
successful psychological adjustment to the college setting (Diener et al., 2010; Fink, 2014; Low,
2011). For instance, college students reporting lower levels of flourishing have been found to
experience significantly more depression symptoms compared to students reporting higher levels
of flourishing (Low, 2011). Critically, among college-aged young adults, flourishing is predicted

by perceived school belonging (Fink, 2014). Further, among SGM young adults, low flourishing
is predicted by low self-esteem and perceived non-acceptance by others (Whitman & Nadal,
2015), suggesting a potential link between school belonging (including perceived acceptance in a
school community) and flourishing in this population.
Beyond the above findings, there is little extant literature on school belonging for
minority populations at the college or university level, or on the relation of school belonging
with socioemotional flourishing among minority college students. Consequently, the aims of the
current study were to examine, 1) whether levels of school belonging and flourishing differ
among SGM compared with cisgender heterosexual college students and between REM
compared with non-Hispanic white college students, and 2) whether the relation between school
belonging and flourishing differs between these groups. Both aims were examined over time
(between ages 18–26) to investigate whether levels of, or the relation between, school belonging
and flourishing change over the course of the typical college period among both undergraduate
and graduate student populations. This study was exempt from institutional review board
oversight as a secondary analysis of deidentified data.
Methods
Data and Sample
Data for this study were drawn from the Healthy Minds Study, an annual survey of the
mental health and wellbeing of college and university students throughout the United States
(Eisenberg & Lipson, 2018). The current sample is composed of respondents aged 18–26 years
who completed the online survey questionnaire during the 2017–2018 academic year; Table 1
provides sample size information by each age. For the analyses presented here (see Analytic
Approach section), comparison groups were constructed using the following criteria. For the

FLOURISHING AMONG MINORITY AND NON-MINORITY STUDENTS

SGM subsample (! = 6,718), participants could endorse a sexual orientation of lesbian, gay,
bisexual, queer, questioning, or other; endorse a gender identity of transgender male/transgender
man or transgender female/transgender woman; or discordantly endorse sex at birth and gender
identity (e.g., male sex at birth and female gender identity). Participants who endorsed a
transgender gender identity and a heterosexual sexual orientation were included in this group.
The cisgender heterosexual participant subsample (! = 19,492) was composed of participants
endorsing a heterosexual sexual orientation and concordantly endorsing sex at birth and gender
identity (e.g., male sex at birth and male gender identity). Participants who identified as
transgender and heterosexual were excluded from this group. For racial/ethnic group
comparisons, the primary criterion for inclusion in the REM subsample (! = 10,539) was
endorsement of a minority racial/ethnic identity.1 Participants could select more than one
race/ethnicity, so this subsample included persons of mixed race/ethnicity (mixed minority
races/ethnicities or individuals of mixed minority-white race/ethnicities). Finally, the nonHispanic white subsample (! = 16,444) was composed of participants endorsing only a white
race/ethnicity and not endorsing any other race/ethnicity. Due to these subsample criteria,
analytic comparison groups (e.g., SGM–cisgender heterosexual) were independent, while noncomparison groups could have overlapping respondents.
Measures
To assess perceived school belonging, participant agreement with four items was
summed to create a school belonging score. The first item, “I see myself as a part of the campus
community,” is a measure adapted from the Perceived Cohesion Scale (Bollen & Hoyle, 1990).
Two further items, “I fit in well at my school” and “Other people understand more than I do

about what is going on at my school,” were adapted from a study of social and academic fit
among college students (Walton & Cohen, 2007). The final item, “I feel isolated from campus
life,” was developed for the Healthy Minds Study (Eisenberg & Lipson, 2018). Participants
endorsed their level of agreement with each item using a six-level Likert-type scale, and items
were recoded for analysis such that responses summed to greater perceived belonging. Before
items were summed, internal consistency of the school belonging items was assessed for each
population subsample included in the analyses. Among SGM participants, " = .77; cisgender
heterosexual participants, " = .74; REM participants, " = .74; and non-Hispanic white
participants, " = .75. Flourishing was assessed using the eight-item Flourishing Scale (Diener et
al., 2010); level of agreement was endorsed using a seven-level Likert scale (with neutral center),
and each item score was summed to an overall flourishing score as recommended by the scale
authors. As with the school belonging items, flourishing item internal consistency was assessed
prior to summing; in all subsamples Cronbach’s alpha ranged from .89 to .91. Respondents
entered their age in years on the online survey questionnaire.
Analytic Approach
To examine the age-varying relations of interest, a varying-coefficients model (VCM)
was used (Hastie & Tibshirani, 1993). This modeling approach, also known as time-varying
effects modeling, utilizes nonparametric spline regression to estimate model coefficients as a
smooth, continuous function of time (Hastie & Tibshirani, 1993; Lanza, Vasilenko, & Russell,
2016). VCMs can accommodate data with various operationalizations of time, including
longitudinal panel data, data collected using intensive longitudinal designs (e.g., ecological
momentary assessment), or cross-sectional data with information available across a series of
developmental points, and can examine relations of interest without potentially inaccurate or

FLOURISHING AMONG MINORITY AND NON-MINORITY STUDENTS

untenable assumptions about the parametric shape (e.g., linear, quadratic) of the association over
time (Lanza et al., 2016). In the present study, models examined the association of school
belonging with socioemotional flourishing among the subgroup of respondents at each age; when
modelled together, these age-specific effects can be interpreted as the age-varying association of
school belonging and flourishing over the age range available in the data (Lanza et al., 2016). As
suggested by Lanza et al. (2016), models were fitted for each subpopulation separately to ensure
full moderation of relations of interests by minority or non-minority identities. Because of the
numerous regression coefficients estimated in VCMs, model interpretation is typically carried
out using plots of the spline function, around which 95% confidence regions are plotted to assess
statistical significance. Models were estimated using the mgcv package (Wood, 2019) for R
Version 3.6.0 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).
Results
SGM college students had significantly lower (all #s < .001) perceived school belonging
and flourishing than cisgender heterosexual students across all age points (Table 1). Similarly,
compared to non-Hispanic white college students, REM students endorsed significantly lower
school belonging between ages 18–21 and flourishing at ages 19, 22, 23, and 25 (all #s < .006).
Between the ages of 24–26, REM college students had significantly higher school belonging than
white students (all #s < .02). Figure 1 shows VCM model results of the age-varying association
of school belonging and flourishing for SGM and cisgender heterosexual college students (Plot
A) and for REM and non-Hispanic white college students (Plot B). All model residuals were
approximately normal, and models explained between 19–24% of variance in the flourishing
outcome. Examining Plot A, the association of school belonging with flourishing is significantly
greater for SGM college students than for cisgender heterosexual students across all ages. In Plot

B, the association of school belonging with flourishing is similar for REM and white college
students between ages 18–22; after age 22, school belonging has a significantly greater
association with flourishing for white college students than for REM students of the same ages.
Discussion
Findings of this study indicate that perceived school belonging has a potentially greater
role in socioemotional flourishing for SGM students than for cisgender heterosexual students.
One possible explanation for this finding is that, because SGM youth experience high levels of
social and family rejection during adolescence (e.g., Durso & Gates, 2012), an accepting and
supportive school climate may produce a compensatory effect on flourishing exceeding that of
non-minority or REM young adults who did not experience prior family or social rejection.
Beyond acceptance, greater school belonging may also reflect strengthened in-group
connections, such as through access to SGM-focused campus groups, that may enhance
perceived well-being. Findings for REM students were less clear. Aligning with model results
that show the magnitude of the association between belonging and flourishing is greater for older
white students, older REM students experienced higher belonging than older white students but
similar levels of flourishing. This finding suggests that there may be other important contributors
to flourishing for REM college students that compensate for the reduced effect of belonging, and
aligns with recent findings that indicate strong ethnic minority (i.e., within-group) identity
among college students may offset the effect of poor school belonging on perceived self-worth –
a key dimension of flourishing (Gummadam et al., 2016). By contrast, white students may lack
strong within-group social connection in comparison to those sharing a minority identity (Molix
& Bettencourt, 2010), and as they age out of the intensely social undergraduate period (i.e., enter
ages 23–26), may experience lower belonging as was found in this study.

A limitation of this study is that it utilizes cross-sectional data, and therefore any withinperson changes in the relation of belonging with flourishing over time could not be investigated.
Causal relations also could not be considered. Further, as noted above, there may be other factors
beyond belonging that influence flourishing, in particular among REM students, that were not
examined in this study. Nevertheless, using a large national sample of both undergraduate and
graduate students, this study shows the unique importance and magnitude of the role of school
belonging in socioemotional flourishing for SGM students and the complex role of belonging for
REM students, using an analysis approach that did not require assumptions about how these
relations may change over time. Considering these findings alongside existing evidence, it is
clear that minority young adults can experience lower perceived belonging in college and
university communities, while at the same time, belonging can have a substantial positive role in
socioemotional flourishing in these settings. These and prior findings underline a need for
university programming that enhances flourishing among both SGM and REM students to
improve psychological adjustment and prevent negative mental health and substance misuse
outcomes. Additional research should examine single and multipronged intervention approaches
that support inclusion of minorities in campus communities, bolster perceived belonging among
these populations, and strengthen within-group connections and minority identity.
