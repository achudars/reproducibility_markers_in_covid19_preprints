Abstract
Meaningful social interactions rest upon our ability to accurately infer and predict other
people’s preferences. In doing so, we can separate two sources of information: knowledge we
have about the particular individual (individual knowledge) and knowledge we have about the
social group to which that individual belongs (categorical knowledge). However, it is yet
unclear how these two types of knowledge contribute to making predictions about other
people’s choice behavior. To fill this gap, we had participants learn probabilistic preferences
by predicting object choices of agents that either belonged to a social group (Group condition)
or not (Individual condition). We quantified how close predictions for a specific agent are
relative to the objective individual preferences of that agent and how close these predictions are
relative to the objective group-level preferences to which that agent belongs. As expected, we
found that participants’ predictions in the Group condition, relative to the Individual condition,
were more similar to the group-level preference, while less similar to the individual-level
preferences. We interpret this pattern of results as indicative of a differential weighting of
individual and categorical group knowledge when making predictions about individuals that
belong to a social group. The results are interpreted in an assimilation account of categorization
and stress the importance of group knowledge during daily social interactions.

Introduction
Meaningful social interactions rest upon our ability to accurately infer and predict other
people’s preferences. In doing so, we can separate two sources of information: knowledge we
have about the particular individual (individual knowledge) and knowledge we have about the
social group to which that individual belongs (categorical knowledge). Therefore, the question
arises how we subsequently weigh these two sources of knowledge when predicting individuallevel behavior. Given the societal implications of inappropriate generalizations, stereotyping,
and accompanying prejudices in daily social interactions, gaining more insights into the
mechanisms behind the formation and use of social categorical knowledge is crucial. Hence,
the current study aims to disentangle the contribution of individual-specific and social
categorical knowledge when predicting people's choice behavior.
How we process individual-specific and categorical knowledge during social interaction
is poorly understood. At the individual level, observed actions are the result of a complex
interplay of one’s intentions, traits, beliefs, and preferences in a given context. However,
observers do not have direct access to this private information, neither is it clear how they relate
to the observed behavior. Moreover, making inferences purely on the basis of individuating
information is a complex and cognitively demanding process in a fast-paced social world [1-3].
Following Dunbar [4], humans tend to interact with up to 150 people who are important for
their daily activities. As such, relying on individual knowledge alone additionally poses an
information processing bottleneck. At the categorical level, knowledge can be accumulated
empirically by repeatedly observing and aggregating the actions of categorized individuals or
explicitly through exposure to media or other means of social learning. This bears the question
as to how we differentiate between individual-specific and categorical information and how
they inform predictions we make about other people’s choice behavior.

Numerous studies have shown that perceivers categorize individuals on the basis of
characteristics such as gender [5], age [6], ethnicity [7, 8], political and religious orientation
[9], and many more dimensions. Once an individual has been categorized into one or more
context-relevant social groups, category-specific knowledge quickly becomes activated [10,
11]. Categorical knowledge can entail information and expectations about behavioral
tendencies, intentions, beliefs, preferences [11] and affect the processing (e.g., encoding) and
(mnemonic) representation of target-related information [12, 13]. As a consequence, the
activation of social categorical knowledge can have powerful effects on perceivers' evaluations
and impressions towards members of that category: phenomena well-studied in the field of
stereotypes and prejudices (e.g., [14-18]).
The aim of the current study is to disentangle the contribution of individual-specific and
social categorical knowledge when predicting people's choice behavior. An underlying
mechanism described in the literature on categorization in general, and stereotypes in particular,
is that (social) categorical knowledge can act as an interpretive frame when evaluating withincategory exemplars such as members of a social group [19, 20]. As a consequence, evaluations
of individual group members tend to be biased in the direction of the knowledge we have about
the group as a whole - an effect generally referred to as assimilation [20, 21]. Importantly,
assimilation also implies that the perceived variability within the category or social group
decreases, thereby making individual group members appear more similar to each other.
Research has identified a host of factors that affect the degree to which categorical knowledge
is utilized. For instance, the utilization of categorical knowledge is increased when i) it is
acquired through empirical observation rather than explicit instruction [22], ii) the target
member fits well the social category [23, 24] , iii) the category in itself is cohesive [22, 25] , iv)
the category knowledge is relevant [26], v) there is uncertainty at the individual level [27, 28] ,
vi) (visual) attention is directed to the social category [29], vii) there are strong prejudices
towards the category [30, 31] but see: [32] and viii) when the social category represents an
4

outgroup (for a review see [33]). In contrast, limited research has focused on investigating
simultaneously how categorical and individual-specific information acquired from individuallevel observations inform our predictions about people's choice behavior. This is important as
people's behavior is typically not only driven by individual-specific beliefs and preferences but
also by norms and expectations imposed by context-relevant social groups. This study
investigates how we predict individual behavior by separately measuring how those predictions
are affected by categorical and individual knowledge and aims to achieve a deeper
understanding of the cognitive processes involved and the underlying knowledge
representations at the individual and categorical level.
To this end, we designed an experiment that allowed us to quantify to what extent
participants’ choice predictions are informed by individual-specific knowledge and categorical
group knowledge accumulated through individual-level observations. Moreover, we
investigated whether accumulated categorical knowledge will be subsequently generalized to
new and unknown group members. Participants were instructed to learn probabilistic object
preferences of multiple agents by predicting which of the objects the agents are most likely to
choose. These agents either did or did not belong to a social group by wearing a shirt with a
common logo (Group condition) or a shirt without a logo (Individual condition). Preferences in
both conditions were defined at two levels: At the individual level, preferences for each agent
were defined using individual-specific preference distributions. At the group level, preferences
were defined as the average of all individual-specific preference distributions within a
condition. Using a measure from information theory, we quantified how similar participants'
predictions in the Group and Individual conditions are to their respective individual-level and
group-level preferences. We hypothesized that relative to the Individual condition, participants'
predictions in the group condition will become more similar to the group-level preferences
while less similar to the individual-level preference. We will take this as evidence that
predictions for categorized individuals are marked by an increase in the use of categorical group
5

knowledge but a decrease in the use of individual-specific knowledge. Moreover, we expect
that the generalization of the accumulated categorical group knowledge to a new agent would
be stronger in the Group as compared with the Individual condition.

Methods
Participants
A total of 26 participants (18 females; Mage = 23.42 years, SDage = 3.45 years, range 18
to 30 years) took part in the current study. Participants were recruited through the Radboud
University online research registration system and none of them reported a history of
neurological or psychiatric disorder. The study was approved by the local ethics committee
(ECG2010-0910-058) and all participants gave written informed consent according to the
declaration of Helsinki. Participants received 10€ or an equivalent of 1 course credit as
compensation.

Stimulus material
All stimuli were presented on an LCD monitor (Benq XL2420Z, 24 inches, 120Hz,
1680x1050 pixels) connected to a stationary computer (Dell Precision T3610, 4 x 3.7 GHz,
8GB ram) running Windows 7. The stimulus material consisted of ten customized computergenerated agents, a custom-designed logo and four custom-designed vases designed that served
as the choice objects (see Fig 1). The agents (50% female) were portrayed from their hips
upward in a frontal upright position with a resolution of 384 x 384 pixels. To increase visual
discrimination of same-sex agents, half of them were designed with blond hair color, the
remaining half with brown hair color. Hair color was further randomly combined with hairstyle
(female: long smooth hair vs. short tail; male: wavy vs. fringe). The clothing of agents only
differed in terms of the color of the shirt and whether or not the shirt had a logo printed on it.
6

The logo was superimposed on the upper left part of the shirt such that it could be easily seen.
The logo displayed an abstract figure in a sporty posture with the text "Sutternden". Both the
design and text of the logo were chosen to have no meaning or natural association with any
agent or task characteristic.
The choice objects consisted of four self-designed vases that differed with regard to
color (stone-like texture vs. wood-like texture) and shape (pear-shaped vs. cone-shaped).
Counterbalancing the color and shape dimensions yielded four unique vases. Choice objects
were presented with a resolution of 106 x 175 pixels.

Task design and procedure
Participants were told that there are eight different agents and that each agent prefers
one of the four different vases. Participants were instructed to give predictions about the most
likely choice of a given agent per trial. They were also informed that preferences are not
absolute and that every agent will eventually choose each object at least once. No information
was given about the logos or any type of group membership. Participants had to use four fingers
of their dominant hand to indicate their prediction on a time accurate (1 ms) in-house button
box. The order of the choice objects on the screen corresponded with the horizontal alignment
of the response keys. The experiment started with a written repetition of the instructions.
Block 1. The first block consisted of 400 trials divided into 4 sub-blocks of 100 trials
separated by short breaks. Every trial (see Fig 1) started with a blank screen presented for a
variable time (between 750 ms and 1250 ms, M = 1000 ms) followed by a prediction phase with
a timeout of 2500 ms. During the prediction phase, the agent was presented on top of the four
choice objects. To highlight the participant's predictions (prediction feedback), a green square
appeared around the selected vase for 750 ms followed by a blank screen (presented between
750 ms and 1250 ms, M = 1000 ms). The trial ended with the presentation of the agent alongside
the agent’s actual choice for 1500 ms (agent choice feedback).

Figure 1. Proceedings of a trial. In Block 1, eight unique agents were each presented 50 times in a randomized
order. Half of the agents had a logo printed on their shirt (Group condition) while the other half did not (Individual
condition). Across participants, agents were randomly assigned to the Group and Individual condition with the
constraint that in each condition half of the agents were female and half were male. The left-to-right order of the
displayed choice objects was randomized across trials and participants.

Agent preferences for the choice objects were defined in terms of categorical probability
distributions at two levels: Individual level and group level. The average over the individuallevel distributions for the Group and Individual condition, respectively, defined the group-level
preference distributions. Importantly, the individual-level distributions of the two conditions
were symmetric with respect to each other (see Fig 2). That is, if an agent in the Group condition
preferred the wooden cone-shaped vase, there was also an agent in the Individual condition that
equally preferred the stone-like pear-shaped vase. The symmetrical preference distributions at
the individual level ensured that preferences at the group level were symmetric as well.
Moreover, preferences at the individual level within each condition were symmetrically
distributed around their respective group-level preference distributions.

Figure 2. Experimentally manipulated individual-level and group-level preferences. Presented are the
experimentally defined individual agent preference distributions (filled circles) belonging to the Group and
Individual condition (orange and blue, respectively). The group-level preference distributions are depicted by the
asterisks, which is the average of all individual preference distributions in that condition. The newly introduced
agents in Block 2 are depicted by triangles. Vases varied on the shape and color dimensions. The x-axis reflects
the probability of choosing a certain color and the y-axis a certain shape, resulting in preferences for the four
choice objects.

In each condition, two agents had a preference for both dimensions of the choice objects
(i.e., a particular shape and a particular color), only one agent had a preference for a single
dimension (e.g., only a particular shape), and one agent did not have a preference at all (i.e.,
uniform distribution over shape and color). Due to the symmetrical arrangement of the
individual-level distributions within and across the Group and Individual conditions, grouplevel preferences only existed along a single dimension. The assignment of the group-level
preference dimension (color or shape), as well as the specific phenotype (i.e., the particular

9

color or shape), was counterbalanced across participants. Overall, every choice object was
chosen for an equal number of times.
Block 2. In Block 2, participants were told that two new agents will be added and that
they should try to learn their preferences as well. No further information was given. Of the 100
trials that participants had to complete in the second block, 60 trials showed one of the two new
agents (30 times per condition). The remaining eight agents were evenly distributed across the
remaining 40 trials. Crucially, the newly introduced agents did not have a preference on the
same dimension that was also preferred by the two groups (e.g., shape); instead, they only had
a preference along the dimension that was not preferred by the groups (e.g., color; see Fig 2).
In other words, the new agents only exhibited an individual-level preference. This would allow
us to investigate to what extent participants learn individual-level preferences that are
independent of group-level preferences. The preferences of the eight agents of Block 1 did not
change in Block 2.
In total, the experiment lasted on average 55 minutes. After completion, participants
were asked whether they got the impression that the two types of agents (with and without a
logo) formed two groups that each had a preference for a particular shape or color or the vases.
To our surprise, only a single participant reported that there were certain patterns in the
preferences of individual agents, pointing to how subtle the manipulation apparently was.

Data analysis and design
A full within-subject design was used. As dependent variable, we employed a measure
referred to as the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLDiv; [34]). The KLDiv, also called relative
entropy, measures the directed divergence from one probability distribution to another and is
here reported in units of bits. Technically, it quantifies how much information is lost when a
distribution Q is used to approximate a distribution P and is consequently not symmetric. Within
the Bayesian framework, it can be interpreted as the information gain when one's prior
10

distribution Q is updated to the posterior distribution P. Importantly, in order to be able to
calculate the KLDiv from Q to P, the support of distribution Q has to be a subset of the support
of distribution P. In other words, both probability distributions need to have non-zero
probabilities over the same set of categories. This was not the case when, for example, a
participant never predicted an agent to choose a particular choice object although the agent
actually did choose each choice object at least once. This happened in 13 participants for at
least one agent. In these cases, before transforming participants' predictions into separate
probability distributions for each agent (prediction distribution), additive smoothing was
applied by adding one pseudocount over the entire prediction distribution's support of an agent.
Subsequently, KLDiv was used to independently quantify how much participants'
predictions diverge from the individual-level preference distribution (Individual level) and the
respective group-level preference distribution (Group level). At the individual level, we
calculated for every agent the KLDiv from the prediction distribution of that agent to the agent's
actual preference distribution. The data was then averaged across the four agents separately for
the Group and Individual condition. A small KLDiv value at the individual level indicates that
participants' predictions were on average similar to the true preferences of the respective agents.
At the group level, we calculated how much the predictions for each agent diverged from the
group-level preferences. The data was then averaged across the four agents separately for the
Group and Individual condition. A small KLDiv value here indicates that participants'
predictions for individual agents were on average very similar to the average true preference of
all agents within the respective condition.
In order to answer our primary research question, we analyzed the data from Block 1
and 2 separately but in the same way. For Block 1 and Block 2, The KLDiv values were subjected
to a two-way repeated measures ANOVA with factors Condition (Group vs. Individual) and
Levels (Individual preference vs. Group preference). The effect of interest pertains to the

11

Condition by Level interaction effect. Interaction effects were further analyzed with pairedsample t-tests. Unless otherwise specified, all p-values were two-tailed.
In an assimilation analysis, we further investigated how differentiated participants’
predictions for the four agents in each condition were as a function of time (i.e., trials). This
represents a direct test of assimilation. To do so, we first calculated the average distribution of
participants' predictions across the four agents separately for each trial, for each participant, and
for each condition. We then used a symmetrical KLDiv [35] to quantify how similar the
predictions for each agent are relative to the average distribution of participants' predictions
that we calculated in the first step. In order to account for zero-values in the distributions, we
smoothed all prediction distributions by adding a pseudocount over the entire distribution’s
support. The resulting divergence values were then averaged to a single value per trial,
participant, and condition reflecting the average statistical divergence from the mean
distribution in bits. This is similar to what is known as the mean absolute deviation. This
analysis permits us to investigate how similar participants' predictions for the four agents in
each condition are over time, regardless of how accurately one has learned the objectively
defined individual-level and group-level preferences. The assimilation analysis was done on
the Block 1 data only.

Results
Block 1
On average, participants missed 2.17% of the trials. The repeated measures ANOVA
revealed no main effect for Level (F(1, 25) = 3.54, p = .071) or Condition (F(1, 25) = 0.15, p =
.70). However, as can be seen in Fig 3, a significant Condition by Level interaction was found
(F(1, 25) = 9.12 , p = .006, hp2 = .27): Compared to the Individual condition, the KLDiv in the
Group condition increased for the Individual-level preferences (MIndividual condition = 0.39 bits,
12

SDIndividual condition = 0.15 bits vs. MGroup condition = 0.45 bits, SDGroup condition = 0.16 bits), but
decreased for the Group-level preferences (MIndividual condition = 0.40 bits, SDIndividual condition = 0.17
bits vs. MGroup condition = 0.38 bits, SDGroup condition = 0.14 bits). Post-hoc analyses within each
Level revealed no significant differences across Conditions (Individual level: t(25) = 1.34, p =
0.19; Group level: t(25) = -0.48, p = .64).

Figure 3. Level by Condition interaction on the Kullback-Leibler divergence for Block 1. The predictions in
the Group condition relative to the Individual condition are more similar to the group-level preferences (have a
smaller KL divergence), while less similar to the individual-level preferences. Error bars represent standard error
of the mean.

Block 2
Participants missed on average 0.88% of the trials. The repeated measures ANOVA
revealed a significant main effect of Measure (F(1, 25) = 32.45, p < .001, hp2 = .56) with the
KL divergence being larger for the Group measure (M = 0.81, SD = 0.40) than the Individual
13

measure (M = 0.52, SD = 0.32). Neither the main effect of Condition (F(1, 25) = 0.08, p = .77)
nor the Condition by Measure interaction was significant (F(1, 25) = 1.69 , p = .21).

Assimilation analysis
In order to visualize the distribution of participants’ predictions across the Group and
Individual condition, bivariate and univariate gaussian kernel density functions were estimated.
Scott’s rule [36] was used to select appropriate bandwidths for the bivariate and univariate
distributions. The resulting gaussian density functions are shown in Fig 4. From there it can be
seen that prediction distributions for agents belonging to the Group condition are more densely
clustered compared to the Individual condition. Visual inspection of the marginal distributions
depicted on the site walls also suggests that the denser clustering in the Group condition is
mostly due to smaller variability when predicting the dimension that is also preferred by the
group – here the shape dimension.

14

Figure 4. Gaussian densities of participants’ predictions in Block 1. The estimated gaussian density functions
represent the bivariate (combined color and shape) prediction distributions for all agents and all participants for
the Individual condition (blue) and Group condition (orange) of Block 1. The curves on the left and right walls
depict the univariate distributions for the color and shape dimensions, respectively. Notice the higher peak in the
bivariate gaussians for the Group condition relative to the Individual condition.

In a first analysis, we tested whether predictions for agents in the Group condition are
more similar to each other than predictions in the Individual condition. For the purpose of
establishing a general assimilation effect, we consider the prediction distributions of the last
trial as it contains the information of all preceding trials. Importantly, visual inspection and
formal tests revealed right-skewed distribution of KLDiv values rendering paired-sample t-tests
inappropriate. Consequently, we used a non-parametric paired-sample Wilcoxon signed-rank
test. A Wilcoxon Signed-rank test on the average KLDiv between the agents on the last trial
shows that the KLDiv was significantly smaller in the Group condition (Mdn = 0.2) compared
to the Individual condition (Mdn = 0.29), Z = -2.49, p = .013). This indicates that the predictions
for the different agents in the Group condition were more similar to each other than they were
in the Individual condition.
To investigate the time course of this effect, we calculated the average difference
between the Individual and Group condition across participants for each trial and fitted a
logarithmic regression on the event series data (see Fig 5). Overall, the regression model was
highly significant (F(1, 48) = 55.39, p < .001, R2 = .53) and yielded a significant coefficient for
trial (b = 0.02, t = 7.44, p < .001), which indicates that the difference across the two conditions
increased logarithmically over time.

15

Figure 5. Time course of the assimilation effect in Block 1. The upper lines depict the average Kullback-Leibler
divergence for the Individual and Group conditions in Block 1, respectively in blue and orange. Black dots
represent the mean difference between the Individual and Group condition, with the black curve showing a fitted
logarithmic regression model with its 99% confidence band. It is clearly visible that the average KL-divergence is
at almost any point descriptively smaller in Group condition compared to the Individual condition. This suggests
that participants’ predictions for the four agents in the Group condition are less differentiated relative to the
Individual condition.

Discussion
In the present experiment we investigated to what degree predictions about other
people’s choice behavior are differentially informed by knowledge that we have about
preferences at an individual level and knowledge that we have about preferences at a categorical
group level. In addition, we also examined whether accumulated categorical group knowledge
would be generalized onto newly introduced individuals. In our task, participants had to learn
probabilistic preferences of agents that either had a common logo printed on their shirt (Group
condition) or not (Individual condition). As expected, relative to the Individual condition,
participants’ predictions in the Group condition were more similar to the group-level preference
while less similar to the individual-level preferences. Thus, our main finding suggests that
predictions for members of a social group reflect a relative increase in the use of categorical
16

group knowledge accompanied with a relative decrease in the use of individual-specific
knowledge when predicting individual choice behavior. In line with the literature, we interpret
the findings in an assimilation account [20, 21], wherein evaluations of individual group
members tend to be biased in the direction of our categorical knowledge of the group.
Importantly though, assimilation can be realized in different ways.
One possibility is that participants have created an abstract category for agents in the
Group condition based on what is common to those agents on a perceptual level, namely their
logo on the shirt. Categorical knowledge can then be, in theory, accumulated from individual
agent choices by extracting what is common to those agents on a behavioral level: Their
preference for a particular shape of the vase. In this way, categorical group knowledge could
be directly coupled to an abstract cognitive category. When predictions have to be made, those
predictions are then not only informed by what is known about the specific individual, but also
by what is known about the group as a whole, thereby biasing predictions towards the group
preference. Alternatively, the logo manipulation might have drawn participants' visual attention
to the logo, such that the actual agent choices were not only associated with the particular
individual in terms of gender, face, and hair-style, but also with the perceptual logo itself. When
predictions had to be made, those predictions are then not only informed by the knowledge
associated with that individual but also by the accumulated knowledge across all individuals
associated with the perceptual logo itself. This is similar to how perceptual cues related to age,
gender, ethnicity or clothing that, upon encounter, can trigger associations and expectations
related to the characteristic social variables such as traits, beliefs, and desires.
Regardless of the underlying mechanism, two major consequences emerge. For one,
predictions for individual group members are biased toward the average preference of all group
members. For another, individual group members’ preferences are perceived to be more similar
to each other than they actually are. Both effects are indicative of assimilation and are frequently
found in studies on categorization and stereotyping [20, 21]. Our findings are compatible with
17

the idea that assimilation was stronger in the Group condition than in the Individual condition.
This is further substantiated by the assimilation analysis providing clear evidence that
participants’ predictions for individual agents in the Group condition are more similar to each
other compared to the Individual condition. This results in predictions for agents in the Group
condition that are less individual-specific, thereby leading to a relative (though not significant
on its own) decrease in the utilization of individual-specific knowledge. As stated before,
assimilation can in principle be based on any value and does not necessarily have to bias withincategory estimates toward an objective category mean, such as the group-level preferences that
we have experimentally created in the current study. Although descriptively we did find a
relative increase in the utilization of group knowledge in the Group condition, post-hoc tests
revealed that this effect on its own was not statistically significant. A possible explanation for
this is that assimilation did not sufficiently bias individual agent representations towards the
objective group-level preference, but rather towards the subjectively inferred group-level
preferences. In other words, participants clustered the agents in the Group condition around
what they considered to be the average agent preference rather than what the actual average
agent preference really was, namely the experimentally defined group-level preference. This
might have happened because the task was designed in such a way that the actual group-level
preferences had to be inferred by aggregating the individual-level preferences. As a
consequence, precise knowledge about the actual group-level preference requires a sufficiently
large number of observations at the individual level and hence accumulates only slowly over
time.
Interestingly, we did not find that participants generalize their group knowledge to a
different degree depending on whether the newly introduced and unknown agent belongs to the
Group or the Individual condition. This contrasts with earlier findings that generalization of
categorical group knowledge does take place, particularly when the group member is
prototypical for the group (e.g., [23, 24]). Although we can only speculate about the lack of an
18

effect here, it might be that participants’ representations of the group-level preference in the
Group condition were not distinct enough to see clear generalization effects. Although
descriptively we did find a relative increase in the utilization of group knowledge in the Group
condition in Block 1, the post-hoc analysis revealed that this effect on its own was not
statistically significant. Alternatively, participants may not have been sufficiently aware of the
fact that one of the newly introduced members also had a logo printed on his/her shirt, which
decreases the chance of generalizing categorical group knowledge.
Nevertheless, the current study design bears the potential for novel and important
insights in relation to categorization and assimilation. In contrast to most other studies, we
simultaneously focused on the processing of categorical and individual knowledge and
compared how it is affected by whether predictions had to be made for individuals that are part
of a social group or not. Interestingly, participants did not simply group the agents into equal
dichotomous categories based on the presence (or absence) of the logo nor were agents grouped
in terms of their (common) preferences. Instead, participants seemed have categorized the
agents with a logo on their shirt more so than the agents without a logo. This is corroborated by
the assimilation analysis revealing that preferences of agents with a logo are perceived to be
more similar to each other than preferences of agents without a logo. Moreover, the current
experiment was introduced without ever mentioning anything about groups or logos and had to
be performed exclusively on an individual level (i.e., predict individual agent choices). The fact
that only a single participant has realized the presence of group-level preferences not only
shows how efficient our subtle logo manipulation was, it also suggests that it affected
participants' predictions unintentionally and potentially even outside their awareness. Contrary
to the majority of studies in which pre-existing stereotypes were used, our study required
participants to learn the group-level preferences from observations at an individual level. This
gave us direct control over the content of the categorical knowledge and allowed us to

19

investigate not only the degree to which categorical knowledge is used but also how it is formed
in the process of learning individual-specific information.
Although this study deviates from the literature in many ways, and is in that sense
explorative by nature, our findings could have potentially important implications for the
emergence of stereotypes in naturalistic social groups. The results suggest that categorization
triggers basic information processing mechanisms (e.g., assimilation) that affect how we are
going to relate, accumulate, and weigh perceived individual-level behavior in relation to the
person displaying that behavior and the social group to which he or she belongs. This could
facilitate the formation of stereotypes in two interrelated ways: First, categorization decreases
the extent to which we interpret subsequent individual-level behavior as reflecting unique
characteristics of the individual. This holds even if the observed behavior is non-diagnostic for
group membership. Second, it increases the extent to which we interpret the observed behavior
in light of what we know about the group as a whole. As a consequence, categorized individuals
are perceived to be less unique and are expected to behave in accordance with what we know
about the group. Future studies could build upon the current work by investigating the use of
individual and categorical knowledge in in-group / out-group scenarios [33] and could study
the interdependent dynamics of how updated knowledge on a group level affects representations
at the individual level and vice versa. Moreover, the current study addresses categorization in
only one way, namely categorization on the basis of visual features that allow for extracting
information that relate to, for example, ethnicity, age, gender, jobs (e.g., uniforms), and sport
teams (e.g., tricots). However, we also categorize individuals around us in terms of whether
they are our friends, family members, colleagues or even strangers. In these cases,
categorization may not be based on perceptual cues but rather abstract features coupled to
semantic knowledge and episodic memory. Studying these more abstract instances of
categorization opens promising avenues for future research.

20

To conclude, we have provided evidence that categorical and individual-specific
knowledge differentially contribute to making predictions about other people's choice behavior
when they are seen as a member of a social group. Predictions for members of a social group
are marked by a relative increase in using categorical knowledge and a relative decrease in
using individual-specific knowledge. As a consequence, evaluations of individual group
members tend to be biased in the direction of the group - an effect generally referred to as
assimilation. In line with this, individuals that are a member of a social group are perceived to
have more similar preferences than individuals that are not a member of a group.
