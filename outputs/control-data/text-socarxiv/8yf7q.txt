Abstract

16

Accessibility is now a common way to measure the benefits provided by transportation-land use
systems. Despite its widespread use, few measurement options allow for the comparison of accessibility across multiple urban systems, and most do not adequately control for market competition
between demand-side actors and supply-side facilities in localized markets. In this paper we develop
a measure of competitive access to destinations that can be used to accurately compare accessibility between regions. This measure stems from spatial interaction modelling and accounts for
competition at both the supply and demand sides of analysis, regional differences in transportation
networks and travel behaviour, and any imbalance between the size of the population and the
number of opportunities. We use this method to compute access to employment for Canada’s eight
largest cities to comparatively examine inequalities in accessibility, both within and between cities,
and by travel mode.

Accessibility, from an urban geography perspective, is typically understood as the potential for
interaction or ease of reaching destinations (Hansen, 1959). Accessibility is a function of transport
networks, land use characteristics (e.g. one’s location in relation to the distribution of destinations),
as well as individual social and economic factors (e.g. can someone afford a car) (Handy & Niemeier,
1997; Kwan, 1998; Geurs & Van Wee, 2004). Accessibility measures have been used in a wide range
of studies analyzing their effect on activity participation rates (e.g. Paez et al., 2009), employment
outcomes (e.g. Merlin & Hu, 2017), commuting times (e.g. Kawabata & Shen, 2007), as well as
in normative studies analyzing inequalities between neighbourhoods and population groups (e.g.
Delbosc & Currie, 2011), examining changes in accessibility over time (e.g. Farber & Fu, 2017), or
comparing levels of access by different travel modes (e.g. Benenson et al., 2011).

Introduction

Despite the quantity of research on accessibility, there are only a few studies that compare
accessibility between different cities. One reason for this is the difficulty in generating accessibility
metrics which can be used to meaningfully compare between regions which have different quantities and distributions of populations, opportunities, and transport networks. Existing multi-city
studies tend to use non-competitive measures (Kawabata & Shen, 2006; Grengs et al., 2010; Levine
et al., 2012; Owen & Levinson, 2014; Deboosere & El-Geneidy, 2018), which sum the number of
opportunities (e.g. jobs) that can be reached from a location. However, the raw values of accessibility computed for locations in one region are not a meaningful comparator to access scores in
another region in situations where there are capacity constraints at the destination (e.g. like access
to employment where each job can only be filled by one worker). This is because the accumulation
of supply is not adequately discounted for the amount of demand it is servicing. For example,
central Toronto may have tenfold the amount of nearby jobs than central Winnipeg, but if the
nearby labour force is ten times the size, then access should be approximately equivalent as there
is an equal number of accessible jobs per worker.
Accordingly, the objective of this paper is to develop a measure of access to destinations that
accounts for competition and can be used to compare between regions. Specifically, this measure
accounts for competition at both the supply and demand sides of analysis, similar to the balancing
factors of a doubly-constrained spatial interaction model (e.g. Geurs & van Eck, 2003; Horner,
2004). It also accounts for regional specific transportation networks and travel behaviour as well as
differing imbalances between the size of the population and the number of available opportunities.
We apply this method to computing access to employment for Canada’s eight largest urban regions.
We exemplify its use by analyzing spatial inequalities of accessibility within and between regions
as well as by travel mode. The data and methods used are all open-source, so they can be shared
and replicated with minimal cost (https://github.com/SAUSy-Lab/canada-transit-access).

At a basic level, measuring accessibility is concerned with evaluating how well a city’s land use
and transportation system provides people with the opportunity to travel to a broad spectrum
of destinations in a reasonable amount of time. Methodologically, there are a number of ways in
which accessibility has been measured in research and practice (Handy & Niemeier, 1997; Geurs
& Van Wee, 2004). Accessibility measures are typically either place-based (linked to an area or a
specific point in space) or person-based (linked to an individual, often through their daily activity
patterns) (Miller, 2007). Probably the most common form of measuring place-based access to
destination metrics are integral, they sum opportunities that can be reached from specific location(s)
in space (Handy & Niemeier, 1997; Kwan, 1998). These are typically formulated as follows:

Where Ai is the measure of access for a location i. Oj is the number of opportunities at a
location j. Oj can be interpreted as the attractiveness, or gravitational pull, at location j. f (ti,j ) is
a decreasing function of travel cost, t, from i to j. ti,j is based on one or more impedance factors like
travel time or monetary cost. The simplest form of f (ti,j ) is a threshold indicator, which returns a
0 or 1 whether or not the travel time is less than a threshold. In this case, Ai is interpreted as the
number of opportunities (e.g. jobs) that can be reached within a set travel time (e.g. within 30
minutes). Gravity models extend this by using a decay function to weight nearby destinations more
than destinations that are further away. However, measures computed by (1) are most suitable for
analyzing access to destinations where there is no competition for resources at the destination (i.e.
for situations where being able to access an opportunity is not dependent on other people accessing
it as well).
Equation (1) can be expanded in order to incorporate competition for resources at the destination (Weibull, 1976). This has been commonly used in measuring access to health services, often
formulated as floating-catchment approaches, to output accessibility measures as intuitive metrics
like doctors per person (Luo & Wang, 2003; Delamater, 2013). Applied to access to employment,
competitive measures can account for how employment opportunities and the labour force are both
spatially distributed and overlapping, and that competition exists among the labour force for jobs
(Shen, 1998; Geurs & van Eck, 2003; Kawabata & Shen, 2006). Mathematically, this involves
normalizing opportunities at j by the population within their catchment area, Lj .

Where Pi is the population at i competing for opportunities. In research on access to health services,
31 this metric has been simplified by setting f (ti,j ) to an indicator function to generate population to
30

provider ratios (these are commonly referred to as 2-step floating catchment area measures) (Luo
2 & Wang, 2003; Delamater, 2013).

This can be expanded to account for competition at both the origin and destination locations
4 by incorporating Ai into the equation for Lj to normalize for the number of opportunities that
5 someone at location, i, can reach.

This form is akin to a doubly constrained spatial interaction model, where balancing factors
are used to ensure that the sum of flows from i and destined to j equals the observed amount
arriving and departing from each zone (Wilson, 1971; Fotheringham & O’Kelly, 1989). Ai and
Lj are simply the inverse of the balancing factors in the doubly constrained model. Since Lj and
Ai are mutually dependent, they have to be estimated iteratively until they reach convergence.

Convergence is guaranteed if
Oj =
P i (e.g. if the labour force is equal to the number
of employment opportunities). Figure 1 shows, for a simplistic linear city, how the measure of
competitive accessibility in (3) converges after several iterations.

locations which have varying levels of access to the labour force (Geurs & van Eck, 2003; Horner,
2004; Merlin & Hu, 2017). This type of measure has been applied at a regional scale in Sardinia
(De Montis et al., 2011; Caschili et al., 2015), Sweden (Östh, 2011; Östh et al., 2016), and the
Netherlands (Geurs & van Eck, 2003) as well as at an urban scale in Montreal (Cerda, 2009; ElGeneidy & Levinson, 2011) and Los Angeles (Merlin & Hu, 2017). These studies have shown that
competitive accessibility measures are strongly correlated with non-competitive measures; however,
they have differing spatial distributions and rank orders, which can impact conclusions and specific
policy recommendations. Merlin and Hu (2017) also showed that competitive measures of access to
jobs are a better predictor of employment outcomes than integral measures which do not consider
competition. Despite these few existing studies, the majority of research on access to employment
does not consider competition effects or only considers competition at the destination (i.e. a two
step approach). Up until recently, this is likely due to the computational effort of iterative solutions
in regions with many origins and destinations. Moreover, the majority of existing studies comparing
accessibility between regions do not consider competition effects (Kawabata & Shen, 2006; Grengs
et al., 2010; Levine et al., 2012; Owen & Levinson, 2014; Deboosere & El-Geneidy, 2018). From our
knowledge, only Horner (2004) has used a doubly constrained approach to compare accessibility
between regions (for 10 cities in the United States). The study by Horner (2004) only used distance
as impedance rather than mode-specific travel times and it did not consider unemployed populations
competing for jobs, despite the fact that these variables can differ between regions.

26

Accordingly, we expand upon the measure of competitive accessibility shown in equation (3)
in order to account for regions with different levels of imbalance between origin-constraints (e.g
the size of labour force) and destination-constraints (e.g the number of jobs) as well as differing
transport networks and travel behaviour (e.g. cities have differing levels of transit service as well as
populations with differing mode shares). The following are developed and exemplified for measures
of access to employment, but can be applied to measures to other types of destinations where there
is competition and capacity constraints (e.g. for measuring access to healthcare).

The number of people and the number of opportunities in a region is rarely equal. In terms of access
to employment, the number of job opportunities rarely equals the size of the labour force within a
region. This could be due to workers commuting in and out of the region, unemployed individuals
being part of the labour force who are also competing for jobs, people working multiple jobs, or an
urban economy with an excess of job opportunities that remain unfilled. The accessibility measures
in (3) will not converge given that the total opportunities in the region does not equal the sum of the
∑
∑
population who want to access them (i.e. if
Pi ̸=
Oj ). To allow for convergence, either O or P
∑
∑
can be scaled so that
Oj =
P i prior to computing accessibility in (3). However, the quantity
and spatial distribution of these imbalances are most likely different when comparing between

cities, and therefore should be accounted for when generating comparative accessibility measures.
So rather than equalizing P or O prior to iterating, we propose that they can be standardized
using the mean accessibility of the population observed after the first iteration. This allows Ai to
be interpretable as an ersatz opportunities per person metric. The equation for Ai is updated as
follows to incorporate this standardization.

due to unemployment), the second where

Pi <

due to an excess of employment opportunities). These examples are based on the assumption that
there are the same number of population and opportunities in each zone (i.e. perfect jobs-housing
balance) and travel impedance between polygons is consistent across the plane. These figures
indicate how the mean remains stable after each iteration when standardized. The figures also
show how as there are more people competing for jobs, the lower the average level of accessibility in
the region. Running the same simulation with jobs concentrated in the centre (i.e. a mono-centric
urban form) returns similar results, but with a greater range in accessibility from the centre to the
periphery.

Modal split is another important factor to consider when modelling place-based accessibility.
In most cities, people travel to work by different travel modes, and compete for jobs within a multimodal labour force (Shen, 1998; Sanchez, Shen, & Peng, 2004). For example, a job at j would be
more attractive for someone at i, if they have regular access to a private vehicle and the commute
by car from i to j is faster than the commute by transit. Therefore, we need mode specific measures
of Ai , and we also need to expand the measure of Lj to account for multiple modes (e.g. the labour
force that can reach j will be a combination of those who travel by transit and car). This can be

The measures of Ai,λ now depend on the mobility each mode provides relative to other modes,
as well as the mode share for different zones. Figure 3 exemplifies with a case where we assume
that the mode share for each zone is 50% driving and 50% transit and that the impedance function
for travel time to each adjacent zone for transit is 90% than that by driving (i.e. f (tT ) = 0.9f (tD )).
Since mode share is equal across the region in this example, the mean accessibility by transit is
also 90% than that by driving.

Computing Access to Employment for Canadian Cities

The examples in the previous figures are overly simplistic. Real cities have complex transport net13 works and non-uniform spatial distributions of population, employment, and mode share. There14 fore, to further demonstrate the measure presented in (6-7), we compute and compare access to
15 employment for the eight largest urban regions in Canada. By descending order of population, these
12

9

are Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Ottawa, Edmonton, Quebec City, and Winnipeg. For
2 this analysis, we only make use of open-source data and tools in order for the procedure to be
3 replicated and improved upon with minimal cost. This decision does come with some limitations,
4 as congested travel speeds are not available in any open source datasets that we are aware of.

The boundaries of the urban regions for our analysis are Census Metropolitan Areas (CMA).
CMAs are agglomerations of municipalities which pertain to urban areas with a population of over
100,000 in which at least 50% of the employed labour force works in the region’s core, as determined
from commuting data from the previous census (Statistics Canada, 2016a). Although imperfect,
this measurement provides consistency of what constitutes the boundaries of urban regions across
Canada. For our analysis, any adjacent CMAs are merged into a single region due to the commuting
flows and transit agencies that link adjacent CMAs.
For the eight regions, we use 2016 census Dissemination Areas (DA) to model the home
locations of the labour force. DAs are the smallest areas in which socio-economic data is available
from the quinquennial Canadian census, minimizing error due to the modifiable areal unit problem
(see Kwan and Weber (2008) for a discussion of MAUP and its effects in accessibility research).
DAs are designed and delineated for populations of 400 to 700 persons (Statistics Canada, 2016a),
and have been used in other studies on transit accessibility in Canada (Widener et al., 2017; Wessel
et al., 2017). Specifically, we use the population weighted centroids of DAs snapped to the closest
walking network segment to model the home locations of residents. Larger, neighbourhood sized
Census Tracts (CT), however, are used for the location of employment, as they are the smallest
geography in which complete employment data was available for the 2016 census. Since different
spatial units were used for the origins and destinations, the issue of self-potential does not apply in
our study because we are using two different sets of spatial units to model the demand and supply
locations. The issue of self-potential appears when the travel time for the demand and supply
within an areal unit is zero (Frost & Spence, 1995). For the few cases where DAs and CTs are
the same, a population weighted centroid was used for the origin and the geometric centroid for
the destination, so all travel times were greater than zero. It should be noted that several of these
urban regions also run their own travel surveys (e.g. the Transportation Tomorrow Survey in the
Toronto Region) with home and employment locations of residents, but we required data collected
with consistent methodology across the country. Regional travel surveys typically have much more
detailed travel diaries, but survey a lower percent of the overall population. The long-form census
which we draw our data from is a 25% representative sample of Canadian households.
Another primary input into our analysis are travel times between where people live and potential places of employment. To compute these travel times, we built custom network graphs for
each region. The travel times for driving were computed using the routing engine, Open Source
Routing Machine (OSRM) (Luxen & Vetter, 2011), as it includes detailed consideration for driving
attributes like speed limits, turn restrictions, and one-way streets. Due to a lack of open-source
network level congestion data, travel times for driving were computed as free-flow speeds using

OpenStreetMap data, and then multiplied by a congestion factor, kc , to account for how peak-hour
travel is slower than off-peak. The congestion factors were set at 1.7 for Toronto and Vancouver, 1.6
for Montreal, 1.5 for Ottawa, and 1.4 for the remaining four cities. These values were estimated from
reports examining costs of congestion in Canadian cities (Metrolinx, 2008; Urban Transportation
Task Force, 2012) as well as from TomTom, which hosts an online worldwide ranking of congestion
by city (TomTom, 2018). We also apply a minor two minute penalty for parking, tp . The peak
hour travel time by driving between two locations, t∗i,j,d , is thus calculated from the free flow travel
time, ti,j,d via t∗i,j,d = kc ti,j,d + tp . Using commercial speed profile data would likely improve the
accuracy of our calculations. However, a secondary objective of our work was to only use data that
was open-source and freely available. Research by Salonen and Toivonen (2013) showed that the
correlation between travel times computed with and and without modelling link-level congestion
were 0.98, meaning that the relative differences between auto travel times in each region would
only have slight variation. Therefore, this is a reasonable input for our accessibility measures which
compare auto and transit given that we scale travel times to the mean level of congestion in the
region. As well, there may be some spatial error in using a static exogenous parking parameter.
Central areas may have increased parking times as there are more people searching for a spot, but
conversely peripheral areas have larger surface lots, which can require longer walks from the car to
the work location. As well parking time could also be associated with occupation class or income
level (e.g. high income workers would be more likely to have a spot in their building of employment, rather using on-street parking). Individual variations in parking time would likely only have
a slight effect on resulting accessibility measures since they are aggregated to areal units.
Travel times by transit were computed using the open-source routing engine OpenTripPlanner
(2017). These travel times are inclusive of the time walking to and from stops, wait times, invehicle travels times, and transfers. This has two sets of inputs. The first are the walking networks
in each of these cities from OpenStreetMap. The second are transit schedules in the form of
GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data for every transit agency that serves these urban
regions, circa May 2016 in order to align with the collection dates of the 2016 census. We use
these graphs to compute travel time matrices for each of the eight urban regions in our study.
Because of the inherent temporal variations in transit schedules, we follow the precedent in the
literature to compute transit travel times for every minute of the morning commute period (Owen
& Levinson, 2015; Farber & Fu, 2017), to be subsequently averaged when computing accessibility
metrics. Although this is common practice in the literature, taking the average may under-estimate
accessibility as people are likely to select a time that minimizes their commute. For example, it
may make more sense to take the maximum accessibility for 15 minute blocks; but conversely, this
may over-estimate accessibility if this is dependent on transfers which may be possible based on
the schedule data, but unlikely in reality given congestion and bus-bunching during peak periods.
Recent studies have looked at the variation in minute-by-minute accessibility measures (Conway
et al., 2018) and comparing schedule versus real-time (e.g. GPS tracked) measures of accessibility
(Wessel et al., 2017). However more research is likely needed linking travel behaviour outcomes to

11

proper selection of accessibility metrics based on transit schedules. This is not in the scope of our
2 paper, but would be a fruitful direction for future research.

For our analysis, we computed travel times in parallel over several processing units which
output results for multiple departure times, τ . The outputs are stored in a three-dimensional
array, Ti,j,τ = {ti,j,τ }, where each cell, ti,j,τ , is the travel time from the origin zone, i, to the
destination zone, j, for a specific departure time, τ . Due to heavy computation, travel times were
capped at 90 minutes, assuming that no one would be willing to travel to jobs that require more
than a 90 minute commute. For our study of Canadian cities, we expand the measure of competitive
accessibility presented in (7) to account for a labour force which commutes by car or by transit.
This includes averaging transit over the morning commute period (for every minute, τ , from 7:00am
to 8:59am) because of temporal variations in transit schedules.

Ai,T is the accessibility measure for transit, and Ai,D for driving. αi,D is the commute mode share
ratio of workers at location i who travel to work via private vehicle. αi,T is the mode share ratio by
transit and walking. The mode share for transit for our study is assumed as the total non-driving
commuting population (αi,T = 1 - αi,D ), and therefore also includes the small percent of those who
take active modes (bike or walk). This assumes that those who bike or walk to work are also able
to commute to work by transit, but not by car.
We did not have accurate flow data in order to calibrate the travel time impedance functions,
a practice that frequently occurs in the literature (e.g. Horner, 2004; Caschili et al., 2015). As
an alternative, we use a half-life model specification of distance decay to select an exponential
decay function parameterized such that the median commute duration returns a value of 0.5 with
a maximum value of 1 at ti,j = 0 (see Östh et al. (2016) on the use of adopting half-life models for
decay functions). 30 minutes is approximately the median commute duration for journey to work
trips in Canadian cities (Statistics Canada, 2016b). This results in the following exponential decay
function:
f (ti,j ) = e−0.0231ti,j

For thousands of zones, and minute-by-minute travel times, the process for computing multiple
2 iterations of competitive accessibility is computationally intensive. Therefore, we stopped iterating
3 when the correlation with the previous iteration was r > 0.999. This level of convergence was
4 reached after 3 or 4 iterations, depending on the city.

The results are summarized by region in Table 1 and Figure 4. We tabulate data for both
transit access and auto access, as well as a ratio between transit and auto access, to examine the
differences between these two modes. The complete dataset of accessibility measures, as well as
the code used to compute them, are publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/SAUSyLab/canada-transit-access).

The maximum levels of transit access across the country are observed in central Vancouver
and Toronto. Vancouver has a greater average than Toronto however, likely due to Toronto having
a greater abundance of suburban areas with low transit access, pulling down its regional average.
Montreal is similar in size as Vancouver, but it has a lower mean and maximum level of access by
transit. This can be explained by Montreal having less auto congestion (TomTom, 2018), and a
greater network of private access highways, which expedite travel by car (i.e. car commuters can
compete for more jobs). The mean level of auto access for Montreal is greater than Vancouver
and Toronto. In the Montreal and Toronto regions, each internal municipality typically has its
own transit agency, resulting in poorer intra-regional travel, while the central transit agency in
Vancouver services multiple municipalities (Vancouver, Richmond, Surrey, etc.).

Calgary and Edmonton have the lowest averages of access to jobs, both by transit and car. The
21 urban form of these two cities is more dispersed, and there is greater separation between residential

and employment areas. There is also a high concentration of employment in low-density suburban
business parks which have limited transit service and require long walking times from bus stops
to work destinations. The two Albertan cities also had the highest unemployment rates in 2016
compared to the other cities (the unemployment rate was 9.3% in Calgary and 8.5% in Edmonton),
meaning that there are more people competing for jobs, bringing down the overall levels of access
to jobs.

14

Winnipeg has the highest average level of transit accessibility outside the three largest cities.
Winnipeg has fewer peripheral areas with limited transit service, meaning there are fewer areas
pulling down its average, and it does not have any internal motorways which would expedite travel
by car. As well, from visual inspection, it has a greater spatial mix of jobs and housing inside
the city and there is less concentration of employment in suburban business parks. Similar to
Winnipeg, Ottawa and Quebec City have a greater mix of jobs and housing than Calgary and
Edmonton. However, Ottawa and Quebec City are each bisected by a large river with limited
crossings, and different transit agencies operate on either side, limiting accessibility.

In this section, we examine the correlation between competitive accessibility with non-competitive
measures of accessibility in order to understand how they could lead to different results and conclusions. Specifically, we compute Pearson correlation coefficients of competitive accessibility comparing with four different types of standard integral measures as in equation (1); the number of
jobs reachable within 30, 45, and 60 minutes, as well as the number of jobs reachable weighted
using the exponential decay function in equation (12). These correlations are computed for transit
accessibility and for auto accessibility and are presented in Table 2.

Comparison of competitive and non-competitive measures

35

We find very high correlations between the gravity measures of accessibility and the competitive measure of accessibility within each of the eight cities. It is the relative locations of employment
which are the dominant factor in any these accessibility measures. The labour force is more evenly
distributed across each region and accounting for the distribution of the labour force does not appear to have a substantial effect in comparing competitive to non-competitive accessibility measures
within cities. However, when analyzing all eight cities at the same time, the correlation coefficients
decrease by approximately 0.1 (i.e. when the data for all cities are combined into a single table prior
to computing correlations instead of computing correlations for each individual region). This shows
that for studies analyzing an individual city or region would likely have very minor differences in
results using competitive or non-competitive measures of accessibility, but in a multi-city analysis,
the competitive measure is controlling for relative sizes of the labour force and job opportunities
(e.g. central areas in larger cities have more nearby jobs, but also a larger labour force competing
for these jobs).

36

We also found that transit mode share had a greater correlation with competitive accessibility

(r = 0.82), than a non-competitive gravity measure of accessibility (r = 0.80). However, further
2 multivariate analysis would be required to see the effects of competition on mode share, as there
3 are many other land-use and individual-level factors which influence mode share as well.

We exemplify a use case of these measures of competitive accessibility by analyzing the spatial
equity of transit access to employment in Canadian cities. Spatial equity can be defined as how
evenly a good or service, like transit provision, is distributed among the overall population over
space (i.e. this does not consider differences by socio-economic status). Specifically, we compute
the Gini coefficient as measure of spatial equity. Delbosc and Currie (2011) and Bertolaccini
and Lownes (2013) have used the Gini to examine the inequalities of nearby transit availability,
while Welch and Mishra (2013) used the Gini in measuring the inequality pertaining to different
aspects of transit connectivity. We use the Gini to measure the inequalities of competitive access
to employment. Table 3 indicates the Gini for each region, by transit and by car. The greater the
values, the greater amount of inequality of access to employment (the Gini ranges from 0 to 1).
Table 3 also compares the results of the competitive measure of accessibility with a non-competitive
measure, both computed using the decay function in (12).

Overall, there are higher values of inequality for Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. These
regions contain extremely high access neighbourhoods located in their downtown cores, which are
within walking distance to major employment centres, as well as rapid and regional transit services
linking to other employment areas. The range in access between their centres and peripheries
results in greater levels of inequality. Smaller cities tend to have more equal levels of access, but
their central areas have lower levels of access than the centres of Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver.
The larger cities also have a greater abundance of low access suburban areas. Out of the mid-size
cities, Edmonton and Calgary have greater levels of inequality of transit access, while Winnipeg is
the most equitable.
It should be noted that the Gini will change depending on the scale of analysis (Bertolaccini
& Lownes, 2013). For example, if we remove suburban municipalities within the region and only
examine the City of Toronto, which has more frequent transit and more transit-oriented development, then the resulting Gini coefficient for competitive transit access reduces from 0.43 to 0.15 as
it includes fewer suburban areas with minimal transit service.
Table 3 indicates that using non-competitive measures of accessibility result in greater levels of
inequality than competitive measures of accessibility. For the case of Canadian cities, central areas
with high employment concentrations also have higher levels of population density nearby who are
competing for employment. Central areas typically have lower levels of competitive accessibility
than indicated by standard integral measures, while peripheral areas typically have relatively higher
access as there are less people competing for nearby jobs. This reduction in the range of accessibility
results in lower inequality measures, and not accounting for competition can potentially inflate
conclusions of regional transit equity studies.

Table 3 and Figure 4 also highlight how there are substantial disparities by travel mode.
24 Transit accessibility is less than one-third that of auto-accessibility on average. The distribution
23

16

11

of transit access is much more unequal than the distribution of access to jobs by car in each of
the eight cities. Transit networks are typically concentrated along certain corridors and are more
radially focused compared to regionally dispersed road networks. Many suburban areas have sparse
and infrequent transit service, meaning there is a greater share of neighbourhoods at the left of the
distributions. Toronto and Vancouver have the greatest overlap of frequency distributions between
transit and car. These two cities have high levels of transit accessibility in their centres as well as
peripheral communities which are far from the major employment centres which thus have lower
levels of auto access. The smaller, more mono-centric cities have less of an overlap between the
two travel modes. The gap between transit and auto access also show why suburban areas remain
attractive for drivers. When considering competition, especially competition by mode, car drivers
in the suburbs are typically doing very well compared to transit users.

In this paper, we expanded measures of competitive access to destinations so that they can be
used to accurately compare results both within and between cities and by travel mode. There are
three primary contributions to methodology being made. First, this formulation uses an iterative
process to account for competition among the labour force for jobs, and among employers for
potential employees. Second, it is expanded to account for any regional differences in transportation
networks and travel modes, by having parameters for mode share and mode specific travel times
between origin and destination locations. And third, it standardizes for any imbalance between
the size of the population and the number of opportunities in each region, as these values will vary
regionally.

Conclusion

We used this formulation to generate comparative measures of access to employment for eight
Canadian urban regions, and then described how access to employment varies between these regions.
We find that at a regional level Vancouver and Winnipeg have the highest average levels of transit
based access to jobs, and Calgary and Edmonton have the lowest. The neighbourhoods with
the maximum levels of transit access are in central Toronto and Vancouver. We then used these
measures to examine how access to jobs is distributed within these regions using Gini coefficients.
We find that access is more equally distributed in the smaller cities like Winnipeg and Quebec City,
while larger urban areas like Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver have a greater overall inequality
of access to employment. Conducting such analysis with standard integral measures can inflate
measures of accessibility when comparing between regions, as raw values are not standardized by
the size of the labour force or job market. We also found that standard integral measures can
potentially over-estimate the extent of spatial inequities of accessibility.

The application of the formulas presented in this paper examine access to all jobs in a region.
But certainly, not all workers are competing for the same jobs. One direction for future work is to
use the formulations presented in this paper to examine access to employment for specific occupation
classes, industry categories, education, or by income levels. This has been applied in other studies
analyzing inequalities of accessibility (Cervero et al., 1999; Geurs & van Eck, 2003; Fan et al., 2012;
Fransen et al., 2018). At a simple level, this can be formulated by replacing the number of jobs,
Oj , and size of the labour force, Pi , by counts for specific sub-groups (e.g. by occupation class

or income level). However, it is certainly possible that people looking for work may not only be
competing for jobs within their specified income bracket or occupation class. For example, those in
middle-income brackets may also consider lower income jobs if there is dearth of middle-income jobs
available, resulting in greater competition for lower-income jobs as well. Future research should
examine how to accurately incorporate weights by job type and account for competition across job
categories into the formulas presented in this paper. Similarly, we weighted by zonal mode share
to estimate the potential of the labour force to access employment opportunities from each zone.
However, individuals may have more than one mode available to them, and the extent to which
they compete for employment by different modes will be sensitive to individual ability, resources,
and preferences (e.g. whether they have a driver’s license, monetary cost of travel with respect
to income, or sensitivity to longer walking distances to transit stops). More in depth analysis
regarding behavioural impacts on competitive accessibility would likely require individual travel
behaviour data, rather than the zone-based census data used in this study. The census data used
in this study was also limited to the set of all jobs and population within the region, but the
distribution of job seekers and job openings could have differing spatial patterns (Fransen et al.,
2018). Data for job openings and job seekers is unavailable Canada-wide. If it were available, it
would provide the opportunity for more refined accessibility measures as well as a way to validate
existing measures.
In summary, we recommend that the competitive measure outlined in this paper be used
instead of more common non-competitive measures in certain cases, specifically for multi-region
studies on analyzing access to employment in which values are being directly compared between
cities, or as model parameters for analyses predicting behavioural outcomes like mode share, activity
participation rates, or unemployment. Our research also shows how competitive measures can be
used to highlight modal inequalities in accessibility. Competitive measures could also complement
standard non-competitive measures in guiding land-use regulation or transportation investment.
For example, an area with high access using a non-competitive integral measure but with relatively
lower access in a competitive measure would be a good location to plan for increased employment
density, or further improving the links to employment zones. Lastly, since competitive measures
are relatively intuitive as they are presented as opportunities per person, they can be useful for
communicating results. Effectively communicating the realities of accessibility, through maps or
otherwise, is important for providing evidence for urban planning and policy strategies, as well as
increasing the understanding of the transport-land use situation to the general public (Geurs &
Van Wee, 2004; Stewart, 2017).
