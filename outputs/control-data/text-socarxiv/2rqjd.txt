ABSTRACT

20

Sustainable intensification of agriculture (SIA) has become an important concept to ensuring food security in the

21

context of increasing agricultural production while minimising negative externalities in contemporary agronomic

22

systems. In supporting this, there is a need to establish a decision-making and management system that involves

23

the views and opinions of different stakeholders and unifies the goals of SIA amongst them. The objective of this

24

work is to identify and describe pathways toward farm-level SIA. An explanatory network approach and fuzzy

25

cognitive maps (FCMs) support the analysis of stakeholder views across the three pillars of sustainability: social,

26

economic and environmental. Different stakeholder groups were asked to collectively map the pathways towards

27

farm level SIA in a workshop exercise. The respective groups considered a common set of pre-selected factors as

28

potential descriptors of sustainability and created unique maps by adding their own components and descriptors

29

and identifying causal links between them. While the relative weighting of factors by each group differed,

30

according to their perspectives and interpretation, yield, knowledge transfer, water quality, weather extremes and

31

technology/infrastructure were scored as priority descriptors of farm-level sustainability by all groups in an

32

aggregate analysis. Exploratory analysis of FCMs was found to provide an efficient mechanism to investigate

33

stakeholder views on pathways towards farm-level SIA, by identifying causal relationships and interactions

34

between factors and actors that affect its achievement. The study shows that sustainable intensification is a complex

35

dynamic system that includes institutional structures, personal goals, stakeholder interests and socio-economic

36

factors, and is affected by cognitive beliefs and particular knowledge within stakeholder groups. Our results show

37

how experience, knowledge and beliefs affect the perception of farm-level SIA by various stakeholder groups, and

38

how this knowledge is often fragmented and miscommunicated. The exercise confirmed the hypothesis that farm-

39

level SIA has to be seen as a dynamic process in which farm performance is affected by various factors, with the

40

complexity of the process increasing when different stakeholder interests and beliefs combine for farm

41

management.

1. Introduction

46

The predicted increase in world population and shifts in human dietary trends are likely to cause a greater demand

47

for food (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). This places increased pressure on agriculture to intensify food

48

production against a backdrop of increasing scarcity of additional land for agriculture (Lambin et al., 2013) and

49

major threats to the global environment from commercial farming (Chen et al., 2018; Henle et al., 2008; Steinmetz

50

et al., 2016). In the face of these global challenges the concept of sustainable intensification of agriculture (SIA)

51

has come to the fore in recent years (Royal Society of London, 2009). SIA represents as the increase of agricultural

52

production through sustainable development, which is widely accepted by international policy and research as a

53

concept consisting of three main pillars: economic, social an environmental (Rigby et al., 2001; Sala et al., 2015).

54

The European Union (EU) is the largest agricultural importer in the world (European Commision, 2017). As such

55

it is associated with environmental damage in exporting countries (Serrano et al., 2016) food dependant from

56

regions where food security issues may arise in the future (European Envormnental Agency, 2017), which makes

57

European SIA a necessity. However, global versus European perspectives differ in terms of SIA, e.g. European

58

agriculture is already very intensive and problems such as rural-urban migration and widespread land abandonment

59

are much greater than land scarcity and food security. Therefore, for European SIA, the critical issues are the

60

negative environmental impact of agriculture and the failure of the agricultural production growth model to cover

61

the socio-economic needs of rural populations (Buckwell et al., 2014).

62

Although there are established policy agendas at national and at EU levels for sustainable agricultural management,

63

the success of SIA requires techniques that are spatially and socially site-specific (Areal et al., 2018). SIA can be

64

implemented at different scales, but it is acknowledged by research and policy, that effective SIA depends on the

65

sustainable management of individual farms (Dong et al., 2015). Every farm has its own unique physical and

66

structural characteristics, and is usually the legal and economic unit at which most EU policies are directed (Kelly

67

et al., 2018). Also, farming practices are key elements in this process and these depend on farmers who are unique

68

individual decision-making units (de Oliveira Silva et al., 2016). Assessing the success of SIA at farm-level allows

69

for the achievement of the highest spatial accuracy, under the assumption that farms are “micro-systems” that all

70

together form landscapes and wider agricultural systems.

71

Recent research shows that the assessment of farm-level SIA can be achieved by quantifying the economic, social

72

and environmental outcomes of a range of farm management practices (Areal et al., 2018; Barnes and Thomson,
3

73

2014; Gadanakis et al., 2015; Lynch et al., 2018; Vayssières et al., 2011). However, this type of research tends to

74

focus on the results rather than the reasoning behind the methods used to measure SIA and is limited when

75

explaining the way SIA is applied in practice (de Olde et al., 2018). In reality, farm management decisions are

76

largely affected by external factors that are beyond farmers’ control and that interfere with the farmers’ personal

77

decision-making process.

78

To address this, research has focused on farmers’ decision making behaviour using quantitative (Areal et al., 2012;

79

Daxini et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Micha et al., 2015) or qualitative methods (Blackstock et al., 2010; Burton,

80

2004) which investigate how farm management decision-making processes are influenced by various factors,

81

perceptions and attitudes. These studies consider farm management decisions related to specific interventions that

82

address some of SIA. However, if SIA is viewed as an aspiration, rather than a specific aim, then its achievement

83

is an evolving process, and the perceived usefulness of the strategies and paths for its delivery vary significantly

84

between stakeholders (Hoffman et al., 2014). Therefore, achieving farm-level SIA becomes a dynamic process

85

that requires co-ordinated efforts (Weltin et al., 2018), and during this process the farm becomes a complex system

86

with many components, which not only have direct impact on farm performance, but also interact with each other

87

(Levy et al., 2018). These may include policies and regulations or existing beliefs and perceived effectiveness,

88

which vary according to the knowledge and experiences of each stakeholder (Micha et al., 2018). Understanding

89

how these elements translate into farm management decisions requires an investigation of the links and

90

interdependencies between them, which the current literature and policy-making practices lack.

91

In this paper, we adapted the use mental models presented as fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) to present and

92

understand the views of several stakeholder groups associated with SIA to assess the current process of SIA at

93

farm-level, taking into account the influence and interests of the different stakeholders. Mental models presented

94

as FCMs describe a system as a visual network of interdependent components and indicate causal relationships

95

between them. Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) have been used to support the analysis of stakeholder views on

96

different, specific agricultural and environmental issues (Kafetzis et al., 2010), or environmental decision making

97

and management (Papageorgiou and Kontogianni, 2012). FCMs were first developed by Kosko (1986) and are

98

structured modelling techniques that can be used to describe complex knowledge systems (Gray et al., 2014).

99

These maps are structural versions of mental models that indicate direct and indirect causality between the

100

components of dynamic systems, and are able to represent group beliefs (Fairweather, 2010). Such studies
4

101

(Kontogianni et al., 2012; Levy et al., 2018; van Winsen et al., 2013; Vanwindekens et al., 2014) enable a better

102

understanding of the behaviour of complex systems and provide pairwise associations between elements that can

103

be easily quantified with the cumulative strength of the connection. Using FCM for group thinking allows the

104

collective beliefs to be presented and supports the development of social learning (Henly-Shepard et al., 2015).

105

2. Methodology

106

2.1 FCM participatory process

107

To understand the structural and functional aspects of how the different stakeholders conceptualise the

108

implementation of SIA on European farms, FCMs were constructed from groups of stakeholders (farmers, advisors

109

and policy) that influence the farm management decision-making process. The FCMs produced for each group

110

were compared using semi-quantitative analysis (outlined below) and aggregated to produce a final SIA map.

111

Combining the FCMs produced a collective FCM that mapped system components (henceforth termed nodes),

112

which linked to a number of selected sustainability indicators.

113

The main elements of an FCM are: nodes that represent concepts (or components); edges, which represent the

114

links between the nodes (indicated by arrows); and edge weights that indicate the influence (positive or negative)

115

and the strength of the relationship between nodes (Figure 1). FCMs can then be analysed and explained using

116

exploratory network analysis methods, which allow for the quantification of the map links and the in-depth

117

explanation of their structure.

2.3 Group mapping exercise

123

The FCMs from there stakeholder groups, representing farmers, agricultural advisors and agricultural/

124

environmental policy makers were constructed in a participatory exercise, which took place in Ireland during a

125

workshop organized within the Marie Curie INSPIRATION Innovative Training Network (project 675120). In

126

total 48 people participated in the workshop, including farmers, advisors, social and agri-environmental scientists,

127

and policy makers. Three stakeholder groups were formed: a group including farmers, a group including

128

agricultural advisors and applied researchers and a group including policy makers’1.Representatives from applied

129

research and academic institutions, with knowledge on the SIA concept, facilitated each group discussion. The

130

exercise was based on the method suggested by Gray et al. (2015), whereby the nine pre-defined SIA indicators

131

(Table 1) were presented to each group to guide construction of the FCMs. At the beginning of the exercise, each

132

group was given a 150 cm2 blank sheet of paper containing 9 pre-defined farm level SIA indicators (Table 1) in

133

random order. Based on personal perception and experience, the groups were asked to link them using directed

134

arrows (Figure 1) indicating their perceived degree of influence: negative high (---), medium (--), low (-) and

135

positive low (+), medium (++), high (+++). In addition, the groups were asked to identify other components,

136

which they considered to influence the indicators and connect them to each other and to the indicators, as they

137

perceive it to be realistic.

138

2.2. Selection of farm level SIA indicators

139

The stakeholder groups were presented with a number of pre-selected SIA indicators, around which they were

140

asked to build their FCMs. The indicators were selected from the literature (Latruffe et al., 2016; Lynch et al.,

141

2019; Smith et al., 2017) based on the following criteria:

142

a. They were measurable at farm/farm household level

143

b. They were relevant to European agricultural production

144

c. They represent intensive and/or intensifying farms

145

d. They are identified in the literature as consistent and measurable across time

146

e. They equally represent the three main sustainability pillars (environment, economic and social).

147

The farm-level indicators of SIA selected are presented in Table 1.

1

Due to the large number of researchers participating in the workshop, all groups included a number of researchers.

2.4 Exploratory network analysis

151

Gephi© software was used for the visualization and analysis of the FCMs. The FCMs were analysed using the

152

exploratory network analysis method based on graph theory, according to which cognitive maps are transformed

153

into adjacency matrices in the form of the following equation:

154

𝐴(𝐷) = [𝛼𝑖𝑗 ]

155

where the nodes are listed on the vertical and the horizontal axes. When a connection exists between two nodes its

156

weight is coded in the matrix as a number (Byung Sung and Jetter, 2016; Özesmi and Özesmi, 2004). According

157

to graph theory the results of the FCM can be quantified based on a number of statistical outcomes from the

158

adjacent matrix. The metrics presented in Tables 2 and 3 were used to explore the content of the FCMs and compare

159

the nodes that appear in each map.

Central nodes (high D, Table 2) are the largest circles on a map (figures 3-6), representing the most important

164

components to the particular group, which have the most “edges” coming in and out. Dominant nodes (high WD)

165

are signified still by the high weights (‘+++’ or ‘---') of the arrows coming in and out. They may or may not be

166

central, but they also highly influence the system. A node is a receiver, where many arrows “come into” it (high

167

ID). A node is defined as affected (high WID) when overall weight of the arrows coming is high. A node is a

168

driver (high OD) when a large number of arrows “come out” of it. A node is influential (high WOD), where the

169

weight of the arrows coming out is high. From the individual stakeholder types “unique nodes” were also

170

identified, representing factors that were only identified and considered by that particular stakeholder group.

171

The comparison of the FCMs involves calculating values for the components of each system and indicating the

172

similarities and differences between them.

173

2.5 Map aggregation

174

After an initial comparison individual FCMs were aggregated into a final FCM with a new adjacent matrix and a

175

“reinforced” weight for the edges that appeared in more than one FCM. The aggregation was conducted

8

176

qualitatively as in Gray et al. (2012). Here the reinforced edge weights are the result of adding the edge weight of

177

the individual FCMs (example shown in Figure 2).

178
179

180
181

Once the aggregated map was constructed, common components were identified which occurred across all maps.

182

Finally, for the discussion and interpretation of the results, further face-to-face interviews and consultations with

183

the facilitators (2 per group) and some of the participants enabled verification and explanation of the results.

184

3.1. Farmers’ group FCM

193

A visual representation of the farmers group FCM is presented in Figure 3.

194
195

Figure 3: Fuzzy cognitive map of group 1 – farmers group

196
197

The farmers’ FCM has 30 nodes (including the 9 pre-defined indicators) connected with 84 “edges” and a map

198

density of 0.097 (Table 4). As seen in Table 5, the most central nodes are income, yield, succession, P balance and

199

biodiversity. Yield and technology/infrastructure are the most dominant nodes, followed by knowledge transfer,

200

income, social capital succession, farm innovation, agri-environmental schemes, biodiversity and weather

201

extremes. The highest receivers are income and yield. Yield, income and market orientation were strongly

202

positively affected and P balance is the node most negatively affected node. No highly important drivers were

203

identified. Knowledge transfer is highly positively influential (Table 2) together with technology/infrastructure,
13

204

farm innovation and agri-environmental schemes. Weather extremes negatively influence the system. Six nodes

205

are unique to the group: farmers’ attitude, urban migration, labour market, farm fragmentation, land prices and

206

agri-environmental schemes.

207

3.2 Advisors’ group FCM

208

A visual representation of the advisors group FCM is presented in Figure 4.

209
210

Figure 4 Fuzzy cognitive map of group 2 – advisors group

211
212

The advisors’ FCM has 35 nodes (including the indicators), 96 “edges”, and a density of 0.077 (Table 4).

213

According to Table 5, yield and less favoured area are the most central nodes, followed by succession, subsidies

214

and water quality. The most dominant nodes are water quality, income, succession, yield and subsidies. The highest

215

receivers are biodiversity and yield. Yield and income are positively influenced, whereas water quality is negatively
14

216

influenced. There are no big drivers or influencers but many nodes have equal smaller WIDs (except water quality

217

with WD=-19). Eight nodes are unique to this group: farmers’ identity, age, education, income support, water

218

quality, labour units, and farm size.

219

3.3. Policy makers’ group FCM

220

A visual representation of the policy group map is presented in Figure 5.

221
222

Figure 5: Fuzzy cognitive map of group 3 – policy group

223
224

The policy group map has 39 nodes (including the indicators) and 85 edges. The density of the system is 0.56

225

(Table 4). Yield, income and resilience are the most central components of the map (Table 5, Figure 4). Yield and

226

resilience are also among the most dominant components, followed by future planning, slurry, research and

227

nitrogen balance. Both yield and resilience are the highest receivers of the map and the most positively affected
15

228

nodes, while N and P balances are the most negatively affected nodes. No node was identified as a major driver,

229

whereas research is a positive influencer (WOD =10, Table 5). No strong negative influencers were identified.

230

Seven nodes were unique to the group: energy, non-farm activities on farm, policy design, future planning,

231

research, insecticides and soil fertility.

232

3.4 Aggregate FCM

233

The aggregate FCM is presented in Figure 6.

234
235

Figure 6: Aggregate FCM

236
237

This FCM represents the complete farm SIA system as viewed by all stakeholders involved in this study. It allows

238

the boundaries of the realisation of SIA at farm-level to be defined and depicts the path towards SIA in a holistic

239

manner. The aggregate FCM has 53 nodes, 233 edges and a density of 0.08 (Table 2, Table 4 and Figure 5). The
16

240

most central nodes are yield, income, social capital, biodiversity and resilience 2 . Yield is the most dominant

241

component, followed by succession, income, technology/ infrastructure, knowledge transfer, resilience, social

242

capital and weather extremes with a negative WD (Table 5). The highest receivers of the map are yield, income,

243

and biodiversity. From the positively affected nodes, yield stands out with an ID of 56 (Table 5), and income and

244

succession follow. The most negatively affected nodes are water quality and P balance. The aggregated system

245

does not appear to have any high drivers (the highest OD is 13 for knowledge transfer, Table 5).

246

Technology/infrastructure and knowledge transfer are positively influential and weather extremes is a major

247

negative influencer.

248

4. Discussion

249
250

4.1 Nodes of group and aggregate FCMs
Herein some of the most important nodes of the aggregate map are discussed. The discussion focuses on central

251

and influential components identified by the stakeholders’ groups that were not among the predefined indicators.

252

The only exception is yield, because it of its great centrality in the aggregate map.
•

253

“Yield”, is the only predefined indicator that solely represents agricultural intensification. Increasing

254

yield generally results from intensification, with its primary purpose to increase farm output and farm

255

income. Therefore, yield is considered more an outcome affected by management decisions rather a

256

contributor to the sustainable development of a farm system (Vanlauwe et al., 2014). The FCMs produced

257

during this study support this theory; in all FCMs yield was a significant receiver and by far the most

258

influenced component, but itself was a weak driver, affecting only the other 2 economic indicators

259

(Figures 3-6). This could confirm that yield “stands above” the whole farm system, and can be considered

260

a goal in its own right (Firbank et al., 2018). At the same time, the high centrality of yield across all

261

stakeholders’ groups indicates how important they all consider it for the farm (and its SIA) and how all

262

components ad elements of the system can work towards achieving it.
•

263
264

“Knowledge transfer” (KT) is a component common to all three stakeholder groups and one of the
strongest influencers in the aggregate map. In the farmers’ map, KT directly affects all social, two

Due to the high number of nodes degree values above 20 are considered high unless the highest absolute value of the
highest degree is less than 20.
2

17

265

economic and one environmental indicator (resilience, succession, social capital, yield, market

266

orientation, biodiversity) while indirectly links to income (through yield), (Figure 3). This link between

267

KT and all three sustainability pillars (Table 1) is an acknowledgement of the perceived benefits of KT

268

services by farmers. This confirms that generally, farmers who engage with KT services tend to recognize

269

its benefits and have a more progressive outlook towards sustainable practices (Prager and Thomson,

270

2014). In the advisors’ map, KT is directly linked to the economic indicators and to subsidies. According

271

to the advisors, this outcome reflects the view that advisors mainly act as administrators who deal with

272

farm grant and subsidy applications and ensure financial stability of farms (Mahon et al., 2010). However,

273

with most farm subsidies promoting best-practice methods of production (European Commision, 2016),

274

it is not surprising that there is a strong indirect effect of KT on environmental indicators. For policy

275

makers KT did not feature as strongly in their FCM. The over-riding concern of policy makers is the

276

development of policies and achieving stated objectives thus, they are not so concerned with the details

277

of KT services and how those may influence farm management.

278

As expected in the aggregate map knowledge transfer is a highly dominant component with a strong

279

positive influence. This highlights the overall importance of KT for SIA at farm level, which is confirmed

280

in previous studies (Mahon et al., 2010; Micha et al., 2018; Toderi et al., 2007).

281

•

“Water quality” is an ecosystem service that is easily monitored and regulated at farm-level, primarily

282

through the control of nutrient inputs (Buckley et al., 2015). Intensive agriculture is often thought to

283

impose greater pressure on water quality (White et al., 2014).However, less intensive production systems

284

can pose a significant threat too, under certain biophysical and climate conditions (Roberts et al., 2016).

285

Water quality is a dominant component of the advisors’ FCM, and although unique to this group, the

286

weighted degree value of water quality is high enough to make it a dominant component in the aggregate

287

map. Agricultural advisors play a key role in the dissemination and enforcement of regulations set out

288

by the EU Water Framework Directive and thus recognise the importance of water quality in the SI of

289

agricultural systems. Conversely, farmers do not consider water quality such an important aspect of SI,

290

due possibly to the lack of a direct link between water quality and farm productivity (Macgregor and

291

Warren, 2006).

18

292

•

“Weather extremes” refer to uncontrollable weather events such as storms, flooding and drought, and

293

are a common component of all the FCMs. Weather extremes are the main negative influencer in the

294

aggregate map. According to the FCMs weather extremes play an important role in the farm system, by

295

influencing the decision-making process while being outside human control. An example of this is the

296

requirement to import feed for livestock during periods of fodder shortage caused by storms or drought,

297

which adds significantly to the annual feed bill. All of the stakeholder groups identified a negative

298

influence of weather extremes on farm resilience (Figures 3-6). The references to extreme weather in this

299

study are likely a reflection of the negative impact extreme weather events have on agricultural

300

production. (Seitz et al., 2008; Sivakumar, 2005). Such extreme weather events are increasing in

301

frequency due to climate change conditions (Coumou and Rahmstorf, 2012). As weather extremes

302

become more frequent (Rahmstorf and Coumou, 2011), policies for SIA will need to include measures

303

that increase resilience of farm systems to severe weather events, a fact that, as this study confirms, is

304

recognized by all stakeholders.

305

•

Improved “technology/infrastructure” has a positive influence on farm SIA according to the aggregate

306

map and is strongly linked to all economic and social indicators. The link between technological and

307

infrastructure development in rural areas and the economic and social sustainability of farming enterprises

308

is depicted in research (Carillo et al., 2013; Micha et al., 2015; van Vliet et al., 2015). Despite this, only

309

the farmer group considers technology and infrastructure a dominant component that influences the farm

310

system (Table 5). According to farmers, technology and infrastructure refers to a range of services in their

311

locality, ranging from broadband access to health and financial services, to rural life quality. The

312

perceived importance of technology and infrastructure by farmers on farm SIA is supported by Buysse et

313

al. (2011). However, the influence of technology and infrastructure on SI appears to be underestimated

314

by the other stakeholder groups. This contradiction was explained in further discussions with the

315

facilitators: infrastructure is important to the farmers as individuals, but it is not always essential for a

316

farm to survive. Therefore, advisors and policy makers, although they may recognize the importance to

317

the farmers’ quality of life, they do not fully appreciate its importance for farm level SIA.

19

318

4.2 Group comparison

319

The farmers’ map shows a relatively closed system (density of 0.1). The high density of the farmers’ map indicates

320

that farmers recognize that all farm management elements are interrelated and they understand the dynamic nature

321

of the farm management process. IT also expresses the belief that farm level SIA can be achieved by balancing

322

the existing components, without greatly increasing the complexity of the system. Based on this system

323

description, farm-level SIA appears as a more feasible goal (compared with the other two groups) that can be

324

achieved through strategic changes to the most dominant nodes (like yield, income, water quality, weather

325

extremes, knowledge transfer etc.). However, the higher density of the farmers’ map also indicates that the

326

farmers’ goals are specific to their farm businesses and have little focus on their role in achieving SIA beyond the

327

boundaries of their farms (Macgregor and Warren, 2006). In addition the components identified as important show

328

that farmers evaluate farm efficiency based on practical conditions on their farms and their perception of

329

sustainable management is only relevant to reaching specific goals (Doody et al., 2015).

330

The advisory group map depicts a moderately closed system with no highly central or dominant nodes, (except

331

water quality). This means that many nodes have small but equal interaction with the system. This indicates that

332

advisors’ knowledge of farm-level SIA does not focus on specific areas within the SIA system, and, like farmers,

333

see potential in balancing the existing components for achieving SIA.

334

open system, with many components that loosely interact with each other. In addition, most nodes, in the policy

335

FCM, are identified only as receivers (OD=0) or drivers (ID-0) (Table 5), and have very low WIDs and WODs.

336

This indicates direct causal relationship between few components, but low overall interaction of components

337

within the system. A possible explanation for this is that policy involves several elements from design to

338

monitoring and regulation, and can include various actors (e.g. experts, consumers, etc.) who often represent

339

conflicting interests while generally grouped under the policy design umbrella. In turn, this could explain the fact

340

that often policy design can send multiple signals and uphold conflicting interests, which may lead to conflicting

341

policy messages (Bjørkhaug and Richards, 2008). Indeed, for policy makers farm SIA can be viewed from different

342

perspectives depending on context, and its goals remain subjective. On the other hand, if looked at as an overall

343

purpose, an open system it provides an opportunity to re-consider practices and develop new approaches (Petersen

344

and Snapp, 2015).

Conversely, the policy map showed an

20

345

The aggregate map appears to be a highly complicated system (figure 6). The complexity of the map depicts the

346

“real life” complexity of achieving farm level SIA when all stakeholders’ opinions come together. This confirms

347

that presently SIA is not a defined aim but an abstract goal, and achieving it is not a linear process by a dynamic

348

complex approach. The complexity of the map indicates, in principal, that collective decision-making would take

349

longer to resolve (Levy et al., 2018). However, this map can provide invaluable knowledge on what needs to be

350

prioritized to achieve SIA, when a farm is “co-managed” by many stakeholders. It allows for the identification of

351

the most important parts of a co-managed system, and enables stakeholders to identify its most important elements.

352

By examination of the unique nodes in each map, the aspects of farm-level SIA that are important to each group

353

but neglected by the others become apparent. For farmers these include farmers’ attitude, and a number of nodes

354

that show the relationship of farm sustainability to socio-economic structures that are beyond a farmer’s control.

355

Farm and farmer characteristics are mentioned by the advisors as factors influencing farm sustainable

356

management, a view confirmed widely in the literature (Areal and Riesgo, 2014; Hyland et al., 2018; Micha et al.,

357

2018). Finally, policy makers did not include nodes that directly relate to decision-making processes but included

358

concepts that enhance sustainable intensification at wider levels, such as policy design, non-farm activities, farm

359

innovation, research, soil fertility, and future planning, which, as concepts, are all within the policy agendas

360

(Zagata and Sutherland, 2015). Particularly for the latter, group participants explained that for them, farm-level

361

sustainable intensification is a common goal and its achievement depends on strategic planning rather than the

362

farm and farmers characteristics. This point seems to have been neglected by the other two groups; however, it

363

indicates that policy-makers fail to recognise the individualistic nature of farm-level decision-making.

364

4.3 Method evaluation

365

The exploratory analysis of FCMs provided an efficient means to investigate stakeholders’ views on the pathways

366

towards SIA. For this study, it presented an opportunity to describe elements and factors that they consider

367

important, but also to identify and define how these are interlinked. The method gives stakeholder groups an

368

opportunity. Feedback from face-to-face interviews after the workshop indicated that most participants found the

369

mapping task easy to follow and insightful. Participants reported that the exercise gave them an opportunity to

370

receive an understanding of how their peers viewed SIA and the exercise opened them to conflicting opinions and

371

broadened their own perspective.
21

372

The map aggregation process proved valuable for understanding the complexity of the “real life” situation and

373

provided a robust impression of the opportunities and caveats in achieving farm level SIA when stakeholders with

374

conflicting opinions have to co-operate for a common goal. The identification and confirmation of this complexity

375

would be difficult without such an approach.

376

A caution with respect to the method is the limited qualitative description of the specific meaning of the

377

components and links s particularly where similar concepts appear in different maps. Furthermore, Tt is important

378

to know the discussions that led to a groups’ choices to avoid data misinterpretation and. when using FCMs for

379

exploratory analysis, the lack of qualitative information can be problematic (Reed et al., 2013). To overcome this

380

and to ensure an accurate representation of the thoughts and logic of each group the role of the facilitators was

381

extended: in addition to co-ordinating the group exercises, facilitators held interviews with group participants after

382

the workshop to ensure the information was captured in an accurate manner and remove bias.

383

5. Conclusions

384

In this study a group discussion approach was used to investigate how various stakeholder groups perceive the

385

path towards farm-level SIA and to examine the complexities of achieving a common goal when all opinions are

386

considered.

387

The study showed that sustainable intensification is not a simple target, but a complex dynamic system that

388

includes institutional structures, personal goals, stakeholder interests and socio-economic factors, and is affected

389

by cognitive beliefs and particular knowledge within a stakeholder group. Our results showed how experience,

390

knowledge and beliefs affect the perception of farm-level SIA by various stakeholder groups, and how this

391

knowledge is often fragmented and miscommunicated. Farmers consider farm-level SIA to be a closed system

392

with nodes that interact highly with each other and related to farm management and resource availability. Policy-

393

makers consider it to be an open system with more direct links between nodes, and identify policy design and

394

research related elements as important for its balance. Advisors see farmers’ attitudes and characteristics as

395

dominant nodes for the achievement of SIA, enabling the advisors to be the communicators between policy and

396

the farmers.

22

397

The fuzzy cognitive technique proved useful in obtaining key concepts for farm-level SI. The exercise confirmed

398

the hypothesis that farm-level SIA cannot be simply measured through established indicators, but it has to be seen

399

as a dynamic process in which farm performance is affected by various factors, with the complexity of the process

400

increasing when different stakeholder interests and beliefs combine for farm management.

401

Some main research and policy recommendations for future approaches arise from this study:

402

a) Stakeholders look at SIA only from their own perspective if there is not satisfactory interaction, resulting

403

in a confusing system when their knowledge is combined. This calls for essential and meaningful

404

knowledge exchange. The FCMs provide insight on which concepts and relationships are neglected in the

405

discussions, and identify what the sustainability debate should focus on to advance a common broader

406

sustainable intensification goal.

407

b) Stakeholders’ knowledge and contribution to achieving SIA is fragmented. This creates the requirement

408

for more integrated system thinking approaches. Collective system thinking would enable stakeholders to

409

adjust their thinking to include nodes that in principal are not important to their group. The aggregation

410

process allows perspective barriers to be overcome and creates common reference points. The central and

411

important drives and receivers are potential “starting points” for working towards bridging the gap

412

between stakeholders’ views and guiding actions towards sustainable intensification.

413

c) The results of this study show the importance of involving the different stakeholders, bringing them to one

414

table and creating space and time for discussion and understanding between them. More importantly, the

415

results indicate the need for in-depth incorporation of farmers’ understanding of farm level SIA, in the

416

discussions. This could help in bridging the gaps between policy design and implementation and assist in

417

achieving consensus between groups with conflicting interests on future approaches. Although in the short

418

term this may appear to be a complicated process, in the long term it will enable stakeholders to simplify

419

their thinking and concentrate on the most important points towards the common goal.

420

In conclusion, treating SIA as a system gave the opportunity to identify key concepts that are factored into the

421

decision-making process to achieve farm-level sustainable intensification. When stakeholders with conflicting

422

interests come together to identify the path towards farm-level SI, a complicated process is revealed. Our results

23

423

can provide valuable insights on what the strengths and weaknesses of co-management are, and what future debates

424

on farm-level SIA should focus on for agriculture to take steps forward towards more sustainable intensification.
