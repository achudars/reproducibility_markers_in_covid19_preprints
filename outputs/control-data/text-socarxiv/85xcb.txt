The Social and Genetic Inheritance of Educational Attainment: Genes, Parental Education,
and Educational Expansion

Abstract
Recently, several genome-wide association studies of educational attainment have found
education-related genetic variants and enabled the integration of human inheritance into
social research. This study incorporates the newest education polygenic score (Lee et al.
2018) into sociological research, and tests three gene-environment interaction hypotheses on
status attainment. Using the Health and Retirement Study (N = 7,625), I report three findings.
First, a standard deviation increase in the education polygenic score is associated with a 60%
increase in the likelihood of advancing to the next level of education, while a standard
deviation increase in parental education results in a 68% increase. Second, supporting the
Saunders hypothesis, the genetic effect becomes 11% smaller when parental education is one
standard deviation higher, indicating that highly educated parents are more able to preserve
their family’s elite status in the next generation. Finally, the genetic effect is slightly greater
for the younger cohort (1942~59) than the older cohort (1920~41). The findings strengthen
the existing literature on the social influences in helping children achieve their innate talents.

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

1. Introduction
The idea of the American Dream has led many to believe meritocracy is the primary
mechanism for success in the United States (U.S.) and that opportunities to attain higher
education are equally distributed. However, as reported by the Organization for Economic Coperation and Development (OECD 2016: 74-89), in the U.S., children of college graduates
are twice as likely to enroll in college as are those of high school graduates, and are six times
more likely to go to college than are those of high school dropouts. The strong evidence of
parents’ education influencing children’s education leads to questions about the Dream and
suggests that it is necessary to understand the mechanisms underlying this intergenerational
transmission to mitigate the achievement gaps.
Sociologists usually consider the intergenerational transmission of education a measure
of social mobility. In the U.S., intergenerational mobility depends largely on both parent’s
and children’s educational attainment (Blau and Duncan 1967). However, genetic heritability
also plays a role (Eckland 1967; Duncan 1968; Behrman and Taubman 1989; Jencks and Tach
2006; Nielsen 2006; Nielsen and Roos 2015). Failure to discern the contributions of both
social and biological pathways leads to a weak conclusion that this transmission simply
represents the effect of social inheritance. Past studies using twins and siblings (who
frequently live in the same environment) were not able to account for specific genetic effects
nor were they able to distinguish genetic effects from environmental effects. I seek to solve
this by incorporating an education polygenic score, a measure of the effects of specific
genetic variants on educational attainment.
Education is regarded as an achievement in Sociology highly associated with ascribed
status. The family a child is born into has a profound influence on that child’s personal
achievements. Wealthier families are frequently better able to provide offspring with superior
resources, and these, in turn, assure their success. A recent study has shown that the U.S.

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

recession in 2008 had a greater impact on the financial resources of poor families (Pfeffer,
Danziger, and Schoeni 2013). This study suggests that children from poor families are
disadvantaged when competing for slots in the best colleges and universities when there are
unpredictable shocks to the economy. Sociologists also have begun to consider the effect of
genetic potential in several hypotheses about gene-environment interactions and their effect
on status-related outcomes (Nielsen 2016).
In the recent years, a few social scientists have incorporated the education polygenic
scores of the earlier version genome-wide association studies (GWASs)’ results into their
study. One of the earliest efforts was made by Conley et al. (2015). They used the genetic
polygenic score constructed from Rietveld et al. (2014) to study the effects of genetic and
social inheritance on children’s education. Although the approach of the paper was a
breakthrough at the time, the GWAS they used for the polygenic score only identified 3
genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) then. Therefore, both the
main effects and the interaction results they reported were weak.
As sample sizes increased, recent GWASs identified more SNPs that are significantly
related to educational attainment (Okbay et al. 2016; Lee et al. 2018). The latest study found
1,271 SNPs from a sample of 1.1 million individuals (Lee et al. 2018). Few social scientists
have taken an advantage of the new result to answer their questions of interest so far. One
working paper written by economists (Papageorge and Thom 2018) used the score to predict
education and several labor market outcomes. They also explored the gene-environment
interaction effects on the outcomes. However, while they reported many novel results, the
explanations they offered were not thorough since their focus was to survey the effects of
genes on a variety of status outcomes. Moreover, the paper fell short of providing
sociological interpretation of the results, and thus limited its contribution to understanding
society.

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

This study incorporates the newest genetic polygenic score constructed from Lee et al.
(2018)’s GWAS results into the status attainment research. In addition, I examine the
moderating effects of parental education and historical events on the relationship between
genetic variants and educational attainment. My study population is over the age of 50, thus
were educated during the 20th century’s stable gradual expansion of higher education in the
U.S. The genetic potential for education is likely realized more in the younger of them due to
their greater opportunities for higher education in the period.
While preliminary efforts of adding polygenic scores to social science models have
been made (Conley et al. 2015; Davies et al. 2015; Domingue et al. 2015; Krapohl and
Plomin 2015; Barth, Papageorge, and Thom 2018; Belsky et al. 2018; Liu 2018; Papageorge
and Thom 2018; Trejo et al. 2018), this study endeavors to bring three contributions toward
the field: (1) I confirm the effects of social inheritance and genetic heritability on an
offspring’s educational achievement using the most recent genome-wide association (GWAS)
results (Lee et al. 2018) in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). (2) This study tests the
three gene-environment interaction hypotheses on status attainment and describes the
influences of parental education on the realization of genetic potential. (3) Finally, I explore
how the changes in the macro educational environment in the 20th century America influence
individuals’ achievement of their genetic potential.

2. Theoretical background
2.1. Traditional model of educational attainment
Individuals possess two statuses, ascribed status and achieved status. Ascribed status refers to
the status individuals acquire at birth, such as gender, ethnicity, genetic predisposition,
parental education, and family SES. In contrast, achieved status consists of the attributes an
individual earns, such as educational and occupational success. Sociologists often consider

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

5

these latter achievements as indicators of social mobility.
In their seminal status attainment model, Blau and Duncan (1967) examined the
connection between ascribed and achieved status. They contended that a father’s education
and occupation are influential factors in a child’s educational and occupational attainments,
and thus the ascribed status has a significant impact on social mobility. In their analysis, the
correlation between parental education and children’s education is .310, indicating that a oneyear increase in a father’s educational attainment leads to a .310-year increase in a child’s
education. Their general results show that status attainment can be reproduced across
generations to some extent. Although the relationship between the variables is not strong, the
mechanisms underlying the intergenerational mobility have been explored since then.
Soon after Blau and Duncan’s seminal status attainment model, the Wisconsin Model
was developed to explain the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment by
taking social psychological variables into account, such as the influence and aspirations of
significant others (Sewell, Haller, and Portes 1969). Using a broader framework, Jonsson et
al. (2011) analyzed intergenerational reproduction of occupation, which is tightly linked with
education. They identified four kinds of resources: human capital, cultural capital, social
network, and economic resources. Human capital includes the cognitive skills and abilities
shared by parents and children. Cultural capital refers to shared aspirations, culture and
personal tastes. Social network indicates a family’s social ties within the community that
might connect them to additional resources. Economic resources are the family’s income and
other financial endeavors. By transmitting all of these resources to children, parents
reproduce their advantage or disadvantage in the next generation.
These studies have established the transmission of educational attainment from parent to
child. Their explanations are often built on the assumption that the effects of ascribed status
are transmitted socially. However, biological heritability between parents and children also

6

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

connects parental achievement with their children’s. Thus, the genetic pathway may confound
the social influence. Without considering an individual’s inborn talents, sociologists can
hardly know whether opportunities for higher education are distributed equally among all
Americans at a certain point in time. Likewise, whether an individual’s success is the result
of personal effort rather than SES background cannot be fully understood without considering
how biological and social factors influence each other.

2.2. The integration of biological accounts
2.2.1. Theoretical framework
Although environmental components are relatively obvious, genetic factors cannot be ignored
when considering an individual’s IQ (Eckland 1967). The methods did not exist at the time to
differentiate between hereditary and environmental components (Duncan 1968). Scarr and
Weigberg’s (1987) study on the IQ of adoptees and biological children was an early attempt
at disentangling the effects of biology and the environment effects on intelligence. They
reported strong effects for biological parents’ IQ rather than adoptive parents’ IQ on children,
suggesting that genes accounted for a large portion of the effects of family background.
Researchers began to collect data on twins and siblings to analyze the environmental and
biological influences on social mobility. Using data for male twins born in the U.S. from
1917 through 1927, economists Behrman and Taubman (1989) found that genetics accounted
for more than 80% of the observed variation in schooling. By implementing the behavioral
genetic models (i.e., ACE models), which decompose the total variance in outcome variables
into heritability (A), shared environment (i.e., shared by siblings; C), and non-shared
environment (i.e., measurement errors and individual-specific differences; E), Nielsen (2006)
showed that, for adolescents’ verbal IQ, grade point average, and college plans, the genetic
component explained about 50% to 70% of the variance, the unshared environmental

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

7

component accounted for 30% to 40%, but shared environment explained only as much as
10%. To revisit this question using a new polygenic score, the first hypothesis I test is: both
parental education and genetic predisposition have a positive impact on educational
attainment.
The actualization of genes can be shaped by the environment, especially when barriers
are small and resources are adequate (Bronfenbrenner and Ceci 1994; Perry 2002; Shanahan
and Hofer 2005). When opportunities for the realization of an individual’s genetic potential
increase, the influence of genetic components therefore also increases. Results from Behrman
and Taubman (1989) and Nielsen (2006) mentioned above thus indicate that the educational
opportunities for higher education in the 20th century America were relatively equal.
Specifically on status-related outcomes, there are three main gene-environment
interaction hypotheses (Nielsen 2016). First, the Scarr-Rowe Hypothesis (Tucker-Drob and
Bates 2016) contends that genetic potentials are realized more thoroughly when family SES
is better, e.g., children from disadvantaged backgrounds, who are often constrained from
fulfilling their potentials (Guo and Stearns 2002). Another variant of the Scarr-Rowe
Hypothesis is an initial increment of gene realization when socioeconomic status is low,
which levels off after the environment reaches a threshold.
In the Pareto Hypothesis (Pareto 1909), genetic potentials reach a peak when individuals
are from middle class families, but are realized only weakly in both the poorest and the
wealthiest families because the environments are too harsh and suppressed for the poorer
children to move up and too protective and abundant for the rich children to move down.
Hence, Pareto hypothesized a curvilinear relationship between genetic realization and SES.
The Saunders Hypothesis (Saunders 2010) suggests the opposite of the Scarr-Rowe
Hypothesis. In his analyses of the National Child Development Study in England, Saunders
found that social mobility in England depended largely on meritocracy, since (assuming merit

8

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

is genetic) the genetic-based predicted intergenerational social mobility pattern is almost the
same as the actual pattern. However, Saunders also found that middle-class families could
still prevent their offspring from falling into the working class. Therefore, according to
Saunders, the realization of genetic potentials is constrained by high status families’
preservation of higher education for their children irrespective of their innate abilities.
However, unlike Pareto, Saunders did not hold that the low-status families restrict their
children’s opportunities to realize their genetic potentials.
If any of these hypotheses are supported, the paths between the polygenic score and
family SES should be predictable. To support the Scarr-Rowe Hypothesis (Hypothesis 2a),
the interaction term between the polygenic score and family SES should be positive, i.e., the
genetic component effects are greater in higher status families. If Pareto’s Hypothesis
(Hypothesis 2b) is correct, the interaction term should be positive for middle class families,
but negative or less positive for the lowest and the highest status families. If the Saunders
Hypothesis (Hypothesis 2c) is supported, the interaction term should be negative, i.e., the
genetic component effects are weaker for the those having better socioeconomic statuses.
Researchers have also tested the environmental influences on the realization of genetic
potential and the findings of most of these studies support the Scarr-Rowe Hypothesis. For
example, Guo and Stearns (2002) used a large sibling sample to study the heritability and
social influences on intelligence. Their results indicated that, for children who live in
disadvantaged environments, the realization of their genetic potential is limited. Other
researchers have demonstrated that genes explain nearly zero variation in IQ for children
under the age of 8 in low-SES families, while they account for more than half of the variation
for children in affluent families (Turkheimer et al. 2003; Tucker-Drob et al. 2011).

2.2.2. Genetic data, GWAS, and polygenic score

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

9

Estimates of genetic effects and heritability (provided by twin studies) led to a greater
understanding of the effects of genetics and the environment (Behrman and Taubman 1989;
Nielsen 2006). However, the methodology could not then identify the specific and
overlapping genes within pairs and also could not distinguish genetic effects from
environmental effects, which was problematic as the equal-environments assumption (EEA)
holds that twins are equally exposed to environmental influences relevant to the trait under
study (Freese 2008). Thus, similarities among the pairs could not be readily attributed to
genes.
As molecular genetic data became available, studies started to use this information to
understand human behaviors. Among the 3 billion base pairs in the human genome, about
99% are the same across individuals. The base pairs that vary by individuals are called the
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Locations of the base pairs (called loci.) have been
mapped, so every SNP has its own location code. Researchers can use this information to
locate which variants are associated with traits of interest.
The newly developed Genome-wide association study (GWAS) enables the
identification of variants that are associated with the traits of interest. For humans, there are
about 8 to 10 million common SNPs for which at least one percent of the population has the
rarely observed allelic variant in the reference population. Mostly, laboratories genotype only
about a million of these tagged SNPs and impute others (Belsky and Israel 2014, Manuck and
McCaffery 2014). The ability of GWAS to include many genetic variants and its hypothesisfree nature provide researchers with an unbiased and comprehensive method. Only the
common disease-common variant assumption, which holds that multiple SNPs contribute to a
single disease or trait and thus each of them only has a small effect on the outcome, is
required. So far, the assumption has mostly been supported (Visscher et al. 2012).
To illustrate the GWAS methodology, the form of the regressions used for outcome Y at

10

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

a single 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗 is:

Y = 𝑋𝑋 ′ 𝛽𝛽 + 𝛽𝛽𝑗𝑗 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗 + 𝜀𝜀

where 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗 is the number of a reference allele an individual possesses. If the reference

allele is CG at a particular SNP, an individual has CG on both chromatids will have a value of
2 at the SNP. The number of alleles therefore can be 0, 1, or 2 for each SNP. In addition
to 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑗𝑗 , 𝑋𝑋 ′ is a vector of other control variables including principal components for

ancestral similarities. For millions of SNPs included in the analysis, the above regressions
would be estimated millions of times, one for each SNP.
For social scientists, since the focus is not identifying new loci and the raw findings
from GWAS are not really a concern, a summary score of individual genetic predisposition
for traits can be constructed and incorporated into studies. By multiplying the whole-genome
risk alleles of individuals by the resulting GWAS betas, Purcell et al. (2009) constructed a
polygenic score (PGS) and predicted the incidence of schizophrenia successfully. Usually, the
whole-genome polygenic score, which assumes that a large number of SNPs each contribute
infinitesimal effects to the phenotype, is used in the studies. The score takes the form below:
PGS𝑖𝑖 = � 𝛽𝛽̂𝑗𝑗 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
𝑗𝑗

where 𝛽𝛽̂𝑗𝑗 is the estimated beta for 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 in GWAS, and 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the number of risk

alleles an individual i has for the particular SNP. The PGS was then standardized to enable
the interpretation of the results.

2.2.3. GWAS and educational attainment
Recent efforts in exploring genetic variants related to education were fruitful. Using data
from 126,559 individuals, Rietveld et al. (2013) identified three independent SNPs
(rs9320913, rs11584700, and rs4851266) associated with years of education and college

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

11

completion; although the linear PGS of these SNPs can only account for 2 percent of the
variation in educational attainment, the results have been replicated (Rietveld et al. 2014).
More recent GWAS reported 74 SNPs using 293,723 individuals (Okbay et al. 2016) and
1,271 genome-wide significant SNPs from 1.1 million individuals (Lee et al. 2018). The
newest PGS constructed by the whole-genome SNPs explained 10.6% of the variance in
educational attainment in the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) incrementally. The highest
PGS quintile is also associated with a 40% higher college completion rate in HRS. In this
study, this PGS is used as the genetic source of educational attainment.
Studies have used the whole-genome PGS derived from Rietveld and colleagues’ study
(2013) to predict education in the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the Health and
Retirement Study (HRS). For example, Conley et al. (2015) found that one-sixth of the
correlation between parental and children’s education can be explained by genetic
inheritance, and the genetic effect does not vary by maternal education after controlling for
children’s genetic score. They concluded that the policies fostering equal educational
opportunities might have a trivial impact on intergenerational mobility, since parental
education did not moderate the genetic effects. Other studies have shown that the PGS of
these three SNPs: 1) is positively associated with adolescents’ educational achievement and
has a negative interaction effect with parental education on years of education when using the
sibling fixed effects model (Domingue et al. 2015); 2) accounts for at least 3 percent of the
variance in children’s educational achievement (Krapohl and Plomin 2015); 3) has an
interaction effect with fathers’ social class when predicting education; and, 4) are strongly
associated with income at age 46 (Davies et al. 2015).
The PGS generated using Okbay et al. (2016) has also been used in several studies. Liu
(2018) used the three-generation PGS from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS) to address
the social and genetic pathways. Liu showed that only one-fifth of the transmission of

12

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

educational attainment can be explained by genetic inheritance and a half of this genetic
transmission is mediated by parental education.
More recently, the PGS constructed from Lee et al. (2018) was also incorporated into
several studies. The new PGS was again found to be related to years of schooling, and the
effect was moderated by social environment. For example, school context was found to be
interacting with the PGS (Trejo et al. 2018). Although the interaction between PGS and
school-level socioeconomic status varies across dataset, the interaction effect was significant.
Additionally, studies also explored the effect of the new PGS on status attainment and other
labor market outcomes. Results showed that higher polygenic scores are associated with
higher education, better labor market outcomes, and upward social mobility (Belsky et al.
2018; Papageorge and Thom 2018). A one standard deviation increase in the PGS results in
an increase of 0.58 to 0.83 years in schooling in the analysis of the HRS data (Papageorge
and Thom 2018).
Besides, the gene-environment analysis also showed negative interactions between
childhood SES and PGS when predicting earning at least a high school diploma, but positive
interactions when predicting having at least a college degree (Papageorge and Thom 2018).
These results suggest that the Saunders hypothesis is supported for having a degree less than
college and the Scarr-Rowe hypothesis is supported for earning a college degree and above.
However, these papers might have ignored that college matriculation is often dependent on a
high school diploma by treating educational attainment as either a continuous process or
without conditions; by using the continuation ratio logistic model to test the geneenvironment interaction hypotheses, I attempt to address this issue.

2.3. Historical changes and genetic effects on educational attainment
The actualization of genetic potentials can be influenced by either macro-historical changes

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

13

or the proximal environmental influences on individuals via a gene-by-environment
interaction (G×E). For example, Branigan et al. (2013), in their meta-analysis of educational
attainment across countries, found that the genetic component explains more variance in
education for men than for women and is also stronger for those born after 1950 than for
those born before 1950. In the U.S., Nielsen and Roos (2015) used sibling data to estimate the
variance in educational achievement explained by heritability, shared environment, and nonshared environmental, and found that the variance in education explained by the genetic
component decreased and that explained by shared environment increased as of 2000. The
declining effect of the genetic component indicates the opportunity to attain higher education
in the U.S. has become less equal over the past six decades.
Heath et al. (1985) studied Norwegian twins and found that family background had a
larger impact on the educational attainment of Norwegians born before 1940, although the
patterns varied between genders across time periods (variance due to genetic predisposition
increased for males after World War II, it remained relatively stable for females). The authors
maintained that the increase in the fraction of heritability was mainly due to the Norwegian
government’s adoption of liberal social and educational policies following the war, and that
more opportunities for education were available for males than females at that time.
According to the above studies, I therefore test two hypotheses. If opportunity became
more unequal, genetic effects would decline over time (Hypothesis 3a: became unequal),
while if opportunity became more equal, the effects of genes would increase (Hypothesis 3b:
equalization).
I use cohorts consisting of middle-aged to older individuals (born between 1924 and
1959) who were exposed to federal policies implemented after WWII that expanded higher
education and encouraged youths to pursue secondary educations (Trow 1972, 2007; Mumper
et al. 2011). The nationwide expansion in higher education also implies that the effects of

14

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

parental education would probably be attenuated in the later cohorts. Thus, the final
hypothesis to test is: if educational opportunities become equal, the moderating effects of
parental education would decline in the latter cohorts (Hypothesis 4).

3. Data and methods
3.1. Data
I used data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) (http://hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/), a
nationally representative longitudinal survey of U.S. adults over the age of 50 sponsored by
the National Institute on Aging (NIA) which has been continuously administered since 1992
with data collected every two years; the Institute for Social Research (ISR) at the University
of Michigan collects the data. Information on social, economic, and other factors related to
the antecedents and consequences of retirement are included; HRS also obtained saliva
specimens from respondents in 2006 and 2008. Of specimens provided, 13,129 samples were
genotyped using the Illumina HumanOmni2.5-4v1 array at the Center for Inherited Disease
Research and 12,507 passed the quality control process at the Genetics Coordinating Center
of the University of Washington. However, because the GWAS results for educational
attainment were based on Caucasians (Rietveld et al. 2013; Okbay et al. 2016; Lee et al.
2018), only 8,353 individuals have the calculated polygenic score provided by HRS. To
reduce the potential mortality selection bias among the older respondents, I then limited the
samples to 7,986 cases who were born between 1920 and 1959; of these, 361 individuals who
lacked data on parental education were also dropped, resulting in a final sample size of 7,625
(see Supplementary Table 4, 5, and 6 for the multiple imputation results).

3.2. Variable measurement
Educational attainment

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

15

My outcome variable is educational attainment. HRS’s range of values for this variable was 0
to 17 years and above. I used the categories reconstructed from the HRS 2014 Tracker file to
measure educational attainment; I recombined these categories into: No degree, GED/High
school diploma, Two-year college degree/Degree unknown/Some college, Four-year college
degree, and Master/Professional degree (Ph.D., M.D., J.D.).

Parental Education
I used the highest years of education attained by father or mother instead of including both as
the parental educational attainment measure for fewer missing values. HRS’s values for these
variables ranged from 0 to 17 years and above. I standardized parental education according to
the respondent’s cohort to adjust for the differential distribution of parental educational
attainment across cohorts.

Polygenic score
The education polygenic score (PGS) for European ancestry was used in this study. Lee et al.
(2018) constructed the score for the Health and Retirement Study in Plink using the LDadjusted weights from their GWAS results. The final GWAS-based polygenic score contains
1,144,251 SNPs for European-ancestry individuals. It was standardized in this study for
interpretation.

Cohorts
I used categorical cohort to examine the historical changes hypotheses. I defined categorical
cohort using the six HRS cohorts, which are as follows: Aging & Health Dynamics cohort
(AHEAD), born 1905-1924, which entered in 1993 and was surveyed in 1995, and 1998
through 2012; Children of the Depression cohort (CODA), born between 1924 and 1930,

16

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

surveyed from 1998 through 2010; Health and Retirement cohort (HRS), born between 1931
and 1941, surveyed from 1992 through 2012; War Babies cohort (WB), born between 1942
and 1947, surveyed from 1998 through 2012; Early Boomers cohort (EBB), born between
1948 and 1953, surveyed from 2004 through 2012; and Mid Boomers cohort (MBB), born
between 1954 and 1959, entered in 2010 and was also surveyed in 2012. I combined the War
Babies cohort, Early Boomers cohort and the Mid Boomers cohort to increase the sample size
of the youngest cohort in the cohort-separated analysis. Respondents were restricted to those
who were born between 1920 and 1959 to reduce the influence of the morbidity or mortality
selection issue.

Control variables
Control variables included gender, respondent’s birth region, and degree of urbanization of
respondent’s residential location at age 10.
Population stratification was also considered since the allele frequency differences due
to systematic ancestry differences can result in spurious associations between SNPs and
traits. For example, one of the famous examples is the chopsticks gene (Hamer and Sirota
2000). The chopsticks gene is just an artifact resulting from the different frequency of genetic
variants between Asian and Caucasians. To solve the issue, previous researchers have
conducted principal components analyses to identify the potential ancestral differences in
SNPs in genotype data (Price et al. 2006). Following the most-frequently used approach, I
report the findings with, and without, controlling the largest 10 principal components.

3.3. Analytic strategy
I used the continuation ratio logistic model to better study the determinants of individuals’
transition between stages when they fulfill the requirement or complete the previous stage.

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

17

The general continuation ratio logit model is
ln

Pr(𝑦𝑦 > 𝑗𝑗|𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝑗𝑗)
= 𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 + 𝑥𝑥 ′ 𝛽𝛽
1 − Pr(𝑦𝑦 > 𝑗𝑗|𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝑗𝑗)

where 𝑥𝑥 ′ is the transpose of the vector of covariates, 𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 is the cut point for the j th category

compares to the lowest category, and 𝛽𝛽 is the coefficients of the covariates which are
assumed to be the same across contrasts.

The continuation ratio model is similar to the ordered logit model in the sense that they
each have only one set of coefficients, i.e., both of them require the proportional odds
assumption. However, the continuation ratio model allows interactions between the dummy
stage variables and the other independent variables of interest, and therefore relaxes the
assumption (Allison 2012: 186). If the totally unconstrained model is requested, ordinary
binary logistic regression models, which estimate several models by using the conditional
samples can provide the different parameters (Agresti 2006: 192).
To address my hypotheses, I first included the parental education in the model and added
the PGS to determine the relative effects of social and genetic inheritance on educational
attainment. The model (𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠 indicates the main effects and control variables) is
ln

Pr(𝑦𝑦 > 𝑗𝑗|𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝑗𝑗)
= 𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽1 (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸) + 𝛽𝛽2 (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆) + 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠 𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠
1 − Pr(𝑦𝑦 > 𝑗𝑗|𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝑗𝑗)

Next, to test the moderating hypothesis and determine whether the data supports the
Scarr-Rowe Hypothesis or the Saunders Hypothesis, I added a single interaction term
between parental education and PGS: 𝛽𝛽3 (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆). If 𝛽𝛽3 is

positive, the data supports the Scarr-Rowe Hypothesis; if 𝛽𝛽3 is negative, the Saunders
Hypothesis is supported. I included two more interaction terms in the model to assess

whether the data supports the Pareto Hypothesis, as indicated by a U-shaped relationship
between parental education and the realization of genetic potentials: 𝛽𝛽4 (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸2 ) +
𝛽𝛽5 (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸2 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆).

Here, 𝛽𝛽4 is the coefficient for parental education

18

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

squared and 𝛽𝛽5 indicates the moderating effect of parental education on genes when parental
education is extremely high or low. According to the Pareto Hypothesis, 𝛽𝛽3 should be

positive since children from middle class families are more likely to realize their genetic
potential and 𝛽𝛽5 should be negative due to the crystallizing of the class structure for the
highest and lowest social classes.

I then tested the interaction terms between the PGS, and cohort (𝛽𝛽7 ) to assess changes in

genetic effects over time to understand whether educational opportunity became equal or
unequal in the mid-20th century. The model now is:
ln

Pr(𝑦𝑦 > 𝑗𝑗|𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝑗𝑗)
1 − Pr(𝑦𝑦 > 𝑗𝑗|𝑦𝑦 ≥ 𝑗𝑗)

= 𝜃𝜃𝑗𝑗 + 𝛽𝛽1 (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸) + 𝛽𝛽2 (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆)

+ 𝛽𝛽3 (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸 × 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆) + 𝛽𝛽6 (𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜)

+ 𝛽𝛽7 (𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 × 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶ℎ𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜) + 𝛽𝛽𝑠𝑠 𝑥𝑥𝑠𝑠

If the hypothesis that educational opportunity became less equal is supported, 𝛽𝛽7 should

be negative, since in this scenario the younger cohorts are less likely to actualize their genetic
potential; in contrast, if the equalization hypothesis is supported, 𝛽𝛽7 should have a positive
trend (smaller genetic effects for older cohorts but greater for younger cohorts)

Finally, to test Hypothesis 4, I separated my study population into two aggregated
cohorts (1920~41, and 1942~59) to illustrate the decline of the moderating effects of parental
education.

4. Results
4.1. Descriptive statistics
Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the characteristics of the HRS dataset. First, 57% of
subjects reported their highest degree as a GED or high school graduation. In the older

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

19

cohorts, more individuals have no degree, compared with the younger cohorts; a greater
proportion of the younger cohort earns secondary and postsecondary degrees. Second, the
PGS of education is around 0 after standardization within the analytic sample. The score is
slightly lower in the younger cohorts than in the older cohorts. Third, on average, parents had
approximately 11 years of education, with the parents of younger cohort members achieving
about 2 more years than the parents of members of older cohorts. After standardizing parental
education by cohorts, the means are around 0 for each aggregated cohort and overall. Finally,
there are more females (58%) than males, the respondents were about 70 years old (mean
birth year of 1938) when the genetic data were collected, more individuals were born in the
Midwest, and about half lived in urban areas when they were young.

[Table 1 about here]

Figure 1 illustrates the correlation between parental education and the individual’s PGS.
The Pearson correlation coefficient is 0.21 and is significant at the p<.000 level, thus the
higher the parental education, the greater the PGS for education. The figure suggests that the
effects of parental education can be genetically transmitted, which is often ignored in
sociological studies.

[Figure 1 about here]

4.2. Continuation ratio models predicting educational attainment
Table 2 shows the results from the continuation ratio models. Models 1 and 2 are the
traditional educational attainment models, which only include the demographic and SES
variables. The PGS was added to models 3 through 8. In models 9 through 14, I controlled for

20

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

population stratification by entering 10 principal components to the models.
The results from models 1 and 2 support the traditional status attainment model. Model
1 considers the effects of parental education on offspring’s educational attainment.
Individuals whose parents have a standard deviation more education are 0.82 times
[e0.599=1.820] more likely to advance to the next stage and, after other control variables are
accounted for in Model 2, the positive effect of parental education still holds.

[Table 2 about here]

In Model 3, the PGS effect size of 0.530 indicates that a standard deviation increase in
the PGS is associated with a 1.70 increase in the likelihood of advancing to the next
educational level. The inclusion of parental education in Model 4 reduces the genetic effect to
0.457, and the effect of parental education also decreases from 0.599 in Model 1 to 0.535 in
Model 4. After controlling for other variables except for population stratification, the effects
of both the PGS and parental education only fluctuate slightly.
In Model 7, I tested the Scarr-Rowe Hypothesis against the Saunders Hypothesis and in
Model 8 I tested the Pareto Hypothesis. The significant negative interaction effect in Model 7
indicates that parental education negatively moderates the influence of genes. In Model 8, the
two interaction terms show no signs of supporting the hypothesized inverted U-shaped effect
of parental education on the realization of genes. The Saunders Hypothesis appears to be
supported by the evidence.
In Models 9 through 14, where the population stratification is controlled for, the main
effects of PGS, parental education, and the interaction terms still hold. The effect size of the
PGS drops by a small 0.04 in Model 9 compared to Model 3. In models 10 and 12, the
parental education coefficient decreases only slightly after controlling for population

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

21

stratification. In Model 13, the significant negative effect of the interaction between parental
education and PGS stays the same. The coefficient of -0.053 means that a standard deviation
increase in parental education reduces 11% of the genetic effect [0.053/0.477=0.111].
Combined with the strong and positive effect of parental education, this significant negative
interaction indicates that parents in better positions are capable in preserving the elite status
in the next generation. The pattern shown in Model 8 holds in Model 14 as well.
These results support hypotheses 1 and 2c. The PGSs and parental education have
significant positive effects on the transition to higher levels of education. Moreover, the main
effects of parental education and PGSs are independent from each other to some extent. Only
slight drops or increases are found in the analyses when including other variables in the
models. An auxiliary analysis (not shown) using ordinary least square models also indicates
that including the polygenic score alone explains 10.7% of the variation in years of schooling
with population stratification considered, while parental education and other control variables
account for 22.3%. When I only added the population stratification to the model (which
already controls for SES and control variables) R2 increased to 22.4%, and when PGS was
also added, the R2 increased to 28.1%. These results show that the PGS explains about 6%
[28.1%-22.4%] of the variation in years of education, and support the independent main
effects of both genes and social factors on educational attainment.
For the second hypothesis, the significant parental education×PGS interaction terms
suggest that parental education moderates the genetic influences on education. The negative
results further support the Saunders’ argument (hypothesis 2c). This suggests that highly
educated parents can protect their children from downward mobility.

4.3. Cohort differences
The results for the cohort differences are shown in Table 3. The PGS is slightly stronger in

22

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

the younger cohorts, as can be seen from Model 2. The PGS×Cohort interaction terms are
positive, though only marginally significant. Moreover, while there is a trend of increasing
genetic effect over time and thus supporting the equalization hypothesis, the interaction term
for the youngest cohort is weak.

[Table 3 about here]

To strengthen the equalization hypothesis, Model 3 further includes the Parental
education×Cohort interaction terms and shows a declining effect of parental education in the
younger cohorts. The main effects of PGS and parental education in Model 4 and Model 6
corroborate the results.
In addition, the cohort-separated analyses shown in Models 4 through 7 demonstrate that
the moderating impact of parental education on the PGS is greater for the older cohort in
Model 4, and less strong for the younger cohort in Model 7. This shows some supports for the
hypothesis of equalization in the U.S. education system from the 1920s through the 1970s.

4.4. Predicted probability
Figure 2 shows the predicted probability from Model 1 (Table 3) of advancing to a four-year
college for different levels of parental education and the PGS with other variables held at
means (see Supplementary section 1.1 for discussion on interaction terms in logistic models).
The standardized parental education is divided into three groups based on a 1.5 standard
deviation cutoff, hence, there are three lines plotted, as follows: 1) parental education less
than -1.5 standard deviations; 2) parental education between -1.5 and 1.5 standard deviations;
and, 3) parental education greater than 1.5 standard deviations. In the graph, parental
education affects the probability of going to a four-year college the most when an

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

23

individual’s genetic potential for education is lower. However, as the PGS increases, the
distances between the three lines shrink and the lines converge in the end. The marginal effect
of the interaction term shown in Figure 3 describes the negative moderating pattern. When
holding the covariates at means, the slope of the interaction term is negative, indicating again
as the PGS increases, the influence of parental education on entering a college decreases.

[Figure 2 about here]
[Figure 3 about here]

The cohort differences can be seen in Figure 4. The two plots in Figure 4 shows the
predicted probability for a cohort of attending a four-year college for the three levels of
parental education with covariates held at means. For the younger cohort (age 55), the level
of parental education affects the predicted probability less significantly, while the differences
between the three levels of parental education at the lower end of the PGS are wider for the
older cohort. Figure 4 also shows a trend that the younger the cohort, the higher the
probability of going to a four-year college for individuals at every level of parental education.
This supports the equalization hypothesis.

[Figure 4 about here]

5. Conclusion and discussion
This study has used the latest available genetic measurement to address longstanding issues
regarding educational attainment in sociology. I have demonstrated that both genetic
components and traditional parental education are positively related to educational transitions

24

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

and have independent effects on educational attainment. The inclusion of the genetic
component does not challenge the effect of parental education, affirming the sociological
status attainment model. A one standard deviation increase in the parental education leads to a
68% increase in the likelihood of advancing to the next level of education while the same
increase in the polygenic score results in a 60% increase in the likelihood of advancement.
The significant gene-environment interaction effects of the genetic component and parental
education further enrich our understanding of the educational transition. My results, which
indicate negative interactions between the PGS and parental education, suggest that
resourceful parents are able to assure advantages in schooling for their offspring, even if their
child is less endowed. Individuals from disadvantaged backgrounds are also likely to obtain
higher education, but only if they are talented. This pattern supports the Saunders Hypothesis
but does not support either the Scarr-Rowe or the Pareto hypotheses.
My findings also suggest that educational opportunity in the 20th century U.S. equalized,
and they provide evidence for the effects of historical changes on realizing genetic potential.
Compared to Conley et al. (2015) and Conley and Domingue (2016), who used the less
powerful whole-genome results from Rietveld et al. (2013), my results not only confirms the
effect of genes on educational attainment but also provides evidence for the geneenvironment interactions on both the micro and macro levels.
On the micro level, unlike the weak and slightly positive interaction between the PGS
and maternal education reported by Conley et al. (2015), but similar to Papageorge and Thom
(2018), I found stronger but negative interaction effects of PGS and parental education,
which suggests that the Saunders Hypothesis might be supported. On the macro level, similar
but different from the significant interaction between birth year and PGS in Conley and
Domingue’s (2016) work, I found a weak positive relationship between genetic effects and
educational transition over time, which might support the equalization theory.

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

25

Some of my results are inconsistent with those of previous studies (Conley et al. 2015;
Conley and Domingue 2016; Papageorge and Thom 2018). This might be due to the new
GWAS results I used to construct my PGS or to the different models I used in my analysis.
The continuation ratio logit model approximates the reality more closely because it estimates
the odds of entering the next stage conditioned on completing the previous stage.
My results indicate that the effect of the PGS generally increased as higher education
opportunities have expanded in the 20th century, but the effect dropped in the youngest
cohort. An explanation for the declining effect would be the saturation argument suggested by
Raftery and Hout (1993) in their maximally maintained inequality (MMI) hypothesis. The
MMI hypothesis states that the expansion of higher education aims to equalize the impact of
family SES on educational attainment by increasing opportunities for all. However, as the
supply of this level of education surpasses the demand, familial influences decrease at the
particular level but manifest more strongly at the next higher level. Thus, inequality persists
at the maximum level of education whenever there is at least a higher level that is not
saturated. Saturation refers to the likelihood that all offspring from advantaged families attain
that level of education. For example, when all the children from wealthy families obtain a
high school diploma, the relative advantage of attaining a high school degree for them
decreases from then on. The high school level of education is thus saturated, meaning that the
inequality of attending high school diminishes after the high school level expands (i.e., an
increase in the numbers of students allowed to enroll). The same concept can apply to other
levels of education with equal force.
If the effect of genes is regarded as meritocratic ability, when levels of education are
saturated, genetic influence might also decline. Roksa et al. (2007) demonstrated that the
effect of parental education is slightly weaker for the post-WWII cohort born before the
1970s. Their results also suggest that father’s occupation had a smaller impact on attending

26

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

college for this cohort in the 1980s (a cohort members of which are participants in the Health
and Retirement Study, my data source).
A study using the Swedish Twins Registry data from 1929-1958 (Okbay et al. 2016)
might support the argument. The authors reported the decreasing effect of the all-SNP score
throughout the birth cohorts and suggested this was a consequence of the liberal reform of the
educational system in the 1950s and 1960s, which extended compulsory education and
postponed school tracking. Thus, as higher education became nearly universal, both the
selectivity of higher education and the variation of educational attainment dropped and
genetic effects declined.
The educational expansion in higher education thus offers an explanation to the
fluctuated PGS effects over time as the genetic effect increased during the initial expansion
and declined when the higher levels of education are accessible by most. The new results
should therefore provide new insights on the impact of micro and macro environment on the
realization of individual potential.
With respect to policy-related implications, since both genetics and parental education
are important for educational attainment, resource redistribution policies might improve the
achievement of the children from deprived families. The significant moderating effect of
parental education also implies that welfare policies could help individuals from poor
families to perform better academically.
The empirical support I found in my results for the equalization hypothesis shows the
impact of liberal policies on educational opportunities in the mid-20th century. Future studies
can investigate the changes in genetic effects after the 1980s’ conservative Reagan
revolution; the work of Roksa et al. (2007) examined the changing effects of social
inheritance and demonstrated that the influence of having a parent with an undergraduate
degree or higher on entering four-year college increased significantly again in the 1990s.

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

27

Researchers might consider genetic effect changes during the same period in the future.
This paper also has several limitations. First, the HRS dataset does not include parental
genetic information; parents’ genes may influence their own educational attainment and SES,
thereby affecting children’s genetic realization. Second, utilizing the sibling fixed-effect
model might allow for better control of other unobserved variables; however, sibling
information is not available in the HRS data.
Third, HRS retroactively obtained the parental education, thus increasing the chances of
respondents forgetting or subjectively modifying their parents’ educational attainment,
potentially resulting in recall bias. Another age-related issue is the mortality or morbidity
selection bias of the HRS sample (Domingue et al. 2017). Individuals who have a better
polygenic score for education might live longer. Figure 5 shows that although there is a weak
correlation between age and polygenic score (Pearson’s r=0.05, p<.000), the distribution of
the polygenic score for education is similar across cohorts. Supplementary analysis applying
the inverse probability weights (IPW) as Domingue et al. (2017) suggested shows the similar
results (Supplementary Table 1, 2, and 3).

[Figure 5 about here]

Fourth, the subjects in this study are non-Hispanic whites due to the availability of
GWAS results, and the PGS used in my analyses was constructed by using the meta-analysis
of several cross-national cohorts using the genetics data at a single time from each
participant. However, it is possible that the effects of each SNP have changed over time, and
the SNPs that matter significantly at one point in time might not be significant at other times
(Kulminski et al. 2015). Therefore, caution is needed when generalizing the cohort-specific
results.

28

Genetic Inheritance and Educational Attainment

In spite of these limitations, by including genetic PGS in the analysis, my results
strengthen the sociological explanation of educational attainment. As genetic data become
widely available and molecular genetics advances, future studies can take advantage of the
burgeoning opportunities to not only explore the genetic effects on sociological outcomes, but
further solidify the sociological accounts of social behaviors and status-related outcomes.
