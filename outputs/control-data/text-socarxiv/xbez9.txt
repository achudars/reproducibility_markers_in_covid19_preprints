"18" "Introduction"
"19" "The Internet has helped to significantly reduce the costs of information distribution. The marginal costs of generating and disseminating information are  close  to zero. With the support of smartphones, Internet-based messages can be commented and distributed r ather  quickly. The location of the sender of information plays a subordinate role.  T here is  often  no rivality  for  and no exclusivity  of  information. In other words, information  goods  ha ve  public good s  character istics .  Moreover, t here is asymmetric information. The provider of information knows more about its context an d background than others."
"20" "T he human information portfolio  includes factually correct and incorrect information . It is  crucial  to  have an idea  under which conditions people deal critically with information and when they accept it uncritically.   Psycholog ists  and behavioral economis ts  discuss a  wide  range of concepts about how and why people d eal with  (new)  information.  This is an  essential subject , especially in times of mass media. For example, i n social networks like Facebook, people nowadays are exposed to a huge amount of information.  However, e mpirical and experimental work has shown that people  do not process information as  properly as  predicted  by rational choice theories  (e.g.  Dhami 2016; Grüner and Hirschauer 2018;  Thaler 2016) . The deviations are both systematic and large."
"21" "False  news stories  is  not a new phenomenon. Just think of art forgeries, the forged Hitler diaries (published in  the  Stern ,  1983) ,  or the  famous but deceitful   claim  of the head of state and party of the former  German Democratic Republic  ( GDR ) of  East Germany  Walter Ulbricht (1961) :   “ No one has any intention of building a wall. ”  These examples suggest that false  news stories  can lead to considerable social misallocations.  Kuklinski et al. (2000) argue that a well-informed public is necessary for functioning democracy.  In the age of modern communication technologies people are confronted with so much information  that they   have  probably  difficulties to evaluate the truth content of  each item .   Besides  inadequate  journalism there is a plenty of possible reasons for  creating  false news stories. These include economic interests (more clicks  means  more money through advertising) as well as influencing public opinion and pursuing political interests.  Therefore ,  it is no surprise that Lazer et al. (2018: 1096) call for a redesign of our “information ecosystem” to reduce the dissemination of false information."
"22" "In the last couple of years, people are increasingly getting in touch with “fake news.” Lazer et al. (2018:   1094)  define  fake news  as  “[…] fabricated information that mimics news media content in form but not in organizational process or intent. Fake   news outlets, in turn, lack the news media ’ s editorial norms and processes for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of information. Fake news overlaps with other information disorders, such as misinformation (false or misleading information) and disinformation (false information that is purposely spread to deceive people).”  Other  scholars   are critical  about  the term  “fake news.”   For example,  Quandt et al .  (2018) point out that  it  was popularized in the 2016 US election. Since then, it has not only been used for false or misleading information (e.g. unintentional misinformation  or  intentional disinformation) but also derogatory for journalism or media. In their  Science  article, Vosoughi et al. (2018) speak of “true” or “false” news. They explicitly dissociate themselves from  “ fake news ”  because the term became  seemingly  meaningless in the course of the fashion that politicians call things  “ fake news ”  that do not support their own position. Wardle and Derakhshan  ( 2017 )  refer to the politician ’ s argument , too . In addition they state that the term “fake news” cannot reflect the complexity of  “information  pollution .”  In this paper,  we  use the term “false news stories”  to  avoid ambiguities that are related to  “fake news.”"
"23" "In the next section of the paper,  we  shall describe psychological foundations of dealing  with (new) information: under wh ich  circumstances  are  people  likely to t rust information and who is particularly susceptible to false information stories?  Going more into detail with ( potentially )  false  news  stories , we tackle s ubsequently  experiences, prob lem awareness, and  responsibilities   as reported by   university students  in a questionnaire ."
"24" "Literature  background:  trust in information"
"25" "Many people watch movies in the cinema from time to time. Why? They want to be entertained.  People  are aware that movies usually do not depict reality.  However, the vi sitors  often get involved with the  movie  and  even  show emotions.  Movies  and social media have at least two things in common. First of all, both are mostly leisure activities. In their free time, people want  to  be entertained or just  relax .  People may therefore have little incentive to question the credibility of information in their free time.   Second,  people ch o ose movies and social media that  conform  (at least to a certain extent)  to  their preferences.  Lewandowsky et al .  (2017) stress that social media and social network s  echo any views and beliefs; people can choose where their opinions are best represented.  The echo-effect is likely to be enhanced because u sers of social networks ,  such as Facebook ,  usually receive suggestions to click on that are very similar to what a person has already subscribed to, marked with  a  like or visited  before . Therefore, online users are  more or less trapped  in a so-called “filter bubble.”"
"26" "Humans are boundedly rational and have multiple goals.  Contradicting  the key assumption of standard economics ,   Simon (1957) pointed out that   people  usually  do not optimize.  T hey  are bounded in both their cognitive abilities and information about the relevant environment. Missing information about r ele vant environments constitute a limitation for activities in social media. Cognitive boundaries limit processing of existing information.  People   often  resort to simple decision rules (i.e. heuristics)  to reduce complexity.   They react sensitively to wording.  For example, i t is crucial whether situations are framed as gains or losses :   in order t o avoid losses, people  tend to  take risks; whereas people  tend to be   risk  averse over gains  (Tversky and Kahneman 1981) . Moreover, people are susceptible to suggestibility, which influences memories (Lindsay and Johnson 1989). In addition to heuristics, people  resort to   technical assistance.  As information is overloaded in the information age, people may not even be interested in  being  comprehensive ly and adequately  inform ed.  The search for information with the help  of Internet search engines (e.g.  G oogle) results  in  people adopting entirely  new/ different  problem  solving strategies  ( google effect ; Sparrow et al. 2011). For example, people no longer inform themselves about the route they are taking before  a car trip, but instead make use of  G oogle  M aps. Positive experiences strengthen confidence in technical devices."
"27" "Multiple goals (e.g. intrinsic motivation, recognition by third parties) are particularly important in the area of social media. Social media is public ly visible . As a result, friends and acquaintances are mutually informed about their activities. Although it is often neglected in standard economics, emotions are crucial in social networks. For example, the happiness hormone dopamine creates a positive feeling when one ’ s own contributions are liked or shared. This increases c.p. the probability that contributions are partially composed with the intention of being liked by others. The role of emotions, however, is relatively multifaceted. Adverse messages can be very persistent;  vaguely  remembering that something has happened is often enough to scare people  (consciously or unconsciously)   away. For example, even if you can barely remember negative news in the food sector, the product in question may still be avoided (even without remembering the exact background). Slovic et al .  (2006) illustrate that decisions are  in many cases  influenced by emotions (sometimes referred to as  affect heuristic ) using the example of cancer. Cancer is often associated with deep fears and anxieties. The authors argue: “Thus activities associated with cancer are seen as riskier and more in need of regulation than activities associated with less dreaded forms of illness, injury, and death (e.g. accidents)” (Slovic et al. 2006: 1342). Fears of unpleasant consequences may result in people voluntarily giving up freely available information ( information avoidance ; Golman et al. 2017). For example, upcoming preventive  health check-ups  often trigger a certain  kind   of discomfort.  Even if an  early diagnosis increases the chance to intervene successfully ,  the thought of a serious disease  comes up with  fears (e.g. Sullivan et al. 2004 ; Sunstein  2018 ).  In their study about the spread of true and fals e  news stories analyzing Twitter tweets from 2006 to 2017, Vosoughi et al. (2018: 1146) argue that “false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust.”  Some scholars discuss a much more negative assessment of the uncertain future than the past under the term “declinism” (Elchardus and Spruyt 2016).  If general prospects are considered to be negative, people may be more susceptible to negative headlines. Levari et al.  ( 2018 )  provide evidence that once problems become less frequent, individuals extend their definition of what is considered to be problematic. The authors  (p. 1465)  argue: “Social problems may seem intractable in part because reductions in their prevalence lead people to see more of them.”  This is in line with the observation that violence against refugees does not decrease even when refugee numbers are decreasing."
"28" "Most decisions  are not made  in isolation from  other people. There are situations in which one ’ s own information is not the central basis for decision making. Instead, individuals do what others do.  Sometimes terms like  herd behavior  or  fashion  are also used in this context (Rafaat et al. 2009).  In particular, people tend to prefer popular views ( Bandwagon effect ; Lazarsfeld et al. 1968). On social networks (e.g.  Facebook ), popularity is easy to  identify : the number of likes. The social pressure to conf o rm with others   was  famously  shown, for example, by the conformity experiments by Asch ( 1952;  195 6 ). A related phenomenon is called  reactive devaluation , according to which it is of relevance who made a statement  (Ross and Stillinger 1991; Ross 1995).  There is some persistence of prefabricated opinions (e.g.  conformation bias ).  People believe information more when it is in harmony with one ’ s own beliefs. In other words, people tend to believe information more when their own beliefs are supported; they tend to reject information when it contradicts their own views (e.g. Lord et al. 1979). Another form of selective information processing is called  salience bias  (=   perceptual salience )  a ccording to  which   p eople focus on the piece of information that stands out or appears prominent (Bordalo et al. 2012). For example, if a single white sheep  stands  in a larger herd of black sheep, the white sheep  is treated with great  attention. The relevance of the  salience bias  includes media ’ s choice of topics and coverage. When newspapers write about violence by foreigners in  someone’s  hometown, the probability of violence does not change.  But i t influences what we find salient :   p eople feel uncomfortable when they leave their  apartment s ."
"29" "Source confusion  (also known as  source misattribution  or  unconscious transference ) describes the phenomenon that the origin of a memory is unclear (Zaragoza and Lane 1994; Brown and Marsh 2008). For example, it may be unclear to people whether it is their own experience or whether they have read it  somewhere  else .  It follows that even dubious sources can have a meaningful influence.  In addition,  people often have difficulties  to indicate how long ago  and  how often something  has  happened ( telescoping effect ;   Lavrakas 2008).  Essentially, t here are two  different  kinds of the  telescoping effect : backward and forward telescoping. Forward telescoping means that past events are incorrectly associated with dates closer to the present; backward telescoping means that past events are incorrectly associated with dates further in the past (E l  Haj et al. 2017).  For example,   the  well-known former soccer player and manager of the FC Bayern  Munich ,  Ul rich  Hoeneß, was sentenced to several years in prison for tax evasion.  A fter his release from prison, some  people  argued that the sentence was too mild.  The  forward  t elescoping effect  may help to partly explain this reaction. People perceived the  punishment  to be  more recent than it actually was."
"30" "Starting with Tversky and Kahneman (1973), many replication studies have shown that people perceive events to be more likely they remember well; events  which  they remember less well, on the other hand, are perceived as rather unlikely. This phenomenon has been denoted as  availability heuristic  in the litera ture. In particular, repetition of information increases one ’ s belief in veracity ( illusory  truth effect ; Hasher et al. 1977). This is caused by increasing familiarity: repetition increases familiarity ,  and people prefer things that seem familiar to them over new stimuli. This is also called the  mere exposure effect  or  familiarity principle  (Fechner 1876; Zajonc 2001). Bjork and Allen (1970) have shown that information is particularly memorable when it is repeated over longer periods  rather  than over shorter intervals. Moreover, there seems to be a gap in  the  perception between before and after an event. According to the  hindsight bias  or  knew-it-all-along effect  (Fischhoff 2007), the factual situation before  an  event  could  be  rather vague , but once the event has occurred it is believed that it had to happen."
"31" "The  false consensus effect  suggests that one ’ s own attitudes are also predominantly shared by other individuals (Ross et al. 1977; Marks and Miller 1987). In other words, even if you have a view that only a few others have, there is a tendency to overestimate the  fraction of people  that thinks similarly. This  can  also  be applied  to groups: if you are in a group of a social network there is often a certain basic consensus. The false consensus effect implies that group members assume to represent a view which is typical for the rest of the population. Lewandowsky et al. (2017) point out that the false consensus effect accounts for persistence of existing beliefs. Individuals tend to stick to their views more often and longer. As occasionally  implicitly  indicated above, correcting false news stories is a challenge. For example, there is usually hardly enough time before an election to correct things. But even if individuals are told that  one piece of  information is false, the effect of false news stories may persist or even be amplified. If corrections challenge the worldview of individuals, they may tend to defend th eir  view and even more strongly believe in false information ( worldview backfire effect ); similarly,  correcting false news stories impl ies  repeating  false news  at least  in part, which can, however, increase  the familiarity to it ( familiarity backfire effect ; Lewandowsky et al. 2017;  Swire et al .  2017). According to Lewandowsky et al. (2017), corrections are only effective if two conditions are met: it must not directly challenge the worldview of individuals and detailed explanations  have to  be provided (e.g. reasons  why something is wrong) ."
"32" "Research questions"
"33" "Four research questions address the  participants ’  experiences ,  problem awareness, and  perceived  responsibilities  with regard to   Internet-based false news stories . R esearch  question one deals with the perceived  occurrence  of false stories on Facebook. The other three research questions are more general; they examine the perceived level of damage from false stories, and the responsibility to ensure factually accurate information."
"34" "What  experiences do  Facebook users  have  with false news stories ?"
"35" "Th is  question is  about  experiences  that are  made  during the   use of  the social network Facebook. It  deals with contexts in which people  have  already suspected that they were in touch with false  news stories .   To get an idea of the determinants that may trigger the suspicion of false news stories, the analysis takes into account different activities on Facebook, differences among degree programs as well as the relevance of individual personality traits (e.g. trust in other people  and  life satisfaction)."
"36" "What do people think who suffers mo re  from  f alse news stories  the individual or the society?"
"37" "Factually correct information can be characterized as public goods if no  one  can be  excluded  if there is no rivalry in use. Who would contribute to the production or preservation of the public good?   Probably those who expect a high degree of  individual  involvement.  Even if  the perceived societal   relevance w as  low, people who identify  themselves  with a problem could probably coordinate relatively well  (e.g. due to emotional involvement) .  The situation  seems to be  different if the level of  involvement  is low at the  individual  level , which could be associated with  lower organizability of  people  among each other  even if it is an important issue from the point of view of the society . The research question is also interesting because the sum of the people in this study represents  to a certain kind  a micro society  itself ."
"38" "How do people describe their a bility to detect  Internet-based  false news stories ?"
"39" "Some people  are able to  detect false news stories better than others. But do people  systematically  believe that they can spot false news stories better  than other ?   In other words,  the  research question deals with the  “ better than  the  average  effect.”  This kind of overconfidence has also been labeled as  “ overplacement of one ’ s performance relative to others ”  (e.g. Moore and Healy 2008).  In addition , it is interesting to  search for  determinants  (including  the peoples ’  degree program  and personal traits) that  may  explain individuals ’  tendency  to be  overconfiden t ."
"40" "Which institution is  responsible to bound false news stories?"
"41" "Th is  research question tackles people s’  attitude  of who   is  responsibility to limit false news stories. There are at least three kind s  of agents: government (e.g. via tightening laws), platform operators (e.g. Facebook), and  platform users.  T he correlation s between  the stated preferences to each of these institutions  and various determinants , such as degree program and personality traits ,  are analyzed."
"42" "Implementation and a nalysis strategy"
"43" "A questionnaire was designed to examine  the research questions  described above .   The questionnaire contains questions and statements on general topics such as Internet usage, risk perception, and personality  traits.   With regard to false  news stories  on the Internet, general views and assessments are collected (e.g. ability to  recognize  false news stories ,  damage caused by false news stories). More specifically, the questionnaire is about experiences made  on  the social network Facebook (e.g. individual activities; suspicion of false news stories)."
"44" "R ecruitment  (strategy)  of the  participants"
"45" "University professors and lecturers from various courses of the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg   (Germany)   were contacted per e-mail with the request to carry out a  ( paper and pencil )   survey  during their classes   on  Internet-based  false news stories .   University students seem to be appropriate because they are  likely to be  familiar with social media and social networks.   The recruited participants were enrolled in different degree programs.  Originally, it was intended to recruit at least 40 university students from the degree programs  Business  studies,  Law , and  Computer  sciences .   The starting point can be summarized as follows:  University students from these different degree programs may differ (either through self-selection in to  a degree program or  due to degree program specific differences in education ) in terms of their associations with false news stories."
"46" "The survey was carried out from 29.11.2018 to 19.12.2018 in the classrooms of the courses.  With participants in classroom s , experimental economists occasionally speak of  pseudo-volunteers  (Eckel and Grossman 2000).  In other words,  although participation is basically voluntary, participation rate is relatively high in classroom s  (possibly due to social pressure). Thus, running studies in class has the potential to mitigate the problem of self-selection. This was facilitated by the fact that the lecturers actively supported the study: although they said that the lecture was finished and a survey was being carried out, they pointed out that  the university  students should  stick to their seats  and  join  the study. In the introductory  remarks, participants were also told not to participate more than once in case they had already attended the study in an earlier course."
"47" "Approach to  data analysis"
"48" "This study is explorat ory  and t here is no claim to generalizability.  The results are descriptive only.  The  way the participants were recruited  does not ensure that the sample is representative for a larger population  (e.g.  for  all university students of  the Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg  or even Germany) .  However, the primary aim of this paper is to  seek for  interesting correlations , which  can be investigated in later studies  with higher credibility  using (pre-specified) hypotheses. The latter is sometimes referred to as  “ confirmatory  analysis .”"
"49" "The dependent variables of the research questions above are either binary or ordinal. To investigate these questions we use standard logit and ordered logit models.   The  signs of  the  coefficients of logit and ordered logit models can interpreted. However, coefficients in non-linear models have no meaningful interpretation with respect to effect size. Therefore, we refer to marginal effects as being more informative (Cameron and Trivedi 2010).   While some marginal effects are calculated  holding  variables at specific values (e.g. their means :  m arginal  e ffects at their  m eans ; MEM). The average marginal effect (AME) is the average of the marginal effects computed for each observation at its  observed value  (Long and Freese 2014).  Despite its relatively  infrequent  use, scientific literature advocates AME for theoretical reasons (e.g. Cameron and Trivedi 2005; Long and Freese 2014).  For example, especially for binary independent variables, averages are no possible observations. In this paper, we therefore resort to AME  after  running logit  and  ologit models.  The technical implementation is performed with the Stata command mchange (after l ogit and ologit;  Long and Freese 2014)."
"50" "Currently, there is an intensiv e debate on the use  and interpretation  of p-values (Wasserstein and Lazar 2016 ;  Wasserstein et al. 2019) .  To cut a long story short ,  the legitimation of p-values is based on a chance process (Fisher 1951).   Thus , we need either random assignment of participants to groups (which is  common in economic experiments, but not  in survey studies )  o r  a random sample to meet the conditions of p-values (Vogt et al. 2014). Our sample can  loosely  be  described  as an  ad hoc sample  but not a s  random sa m ple. Thus, p-values may be used  only  as a proxy to decide between two econometric models  in our study,  but not to draw inference on a larger, well-specified population. Therefore, we largely refrain from using p-values within this paper."
"51" "Des c riptive  s tatisti cs"
"52" "A total of 433  university students  attended the survey.  They were enroll ed in different degree programs, most notably  B usiness studies (N=113),  Computer  sciences  (N=47),  Law  (N=83),  History  (N=76), and  Politics  (N=97). Other degree programs are  of less relevance .  Therefore, we mostly deal with these five degree programs in our data analysis."
"53" "Personal data"
"54" "On average, the participants of the study are slightly older than 20 years.  The participants indicated on average that they were in their 2 nd  study semester. How many university students  do  the participants know by name? On a 7-point scale, on average ,  the participants ticked 3.5 (3  means  10-14 people; 4  is identical to  15-19 people).  A total of 426 participants gave information on gender (178 women, 242 men). Six people stated that they did not identify themselves as man or woman.  Admittedly, it was already known before the study was carried out that beginning with 2019 the gender  “ divers e ”  was  part of the  official   birth register. Nevertheless, the dichotomy of man and woman was consciously chosen in the questionnaire. The main reason for this was that the third sex probably had not yet been internalized by all participants (conversations with participants subsequent to the study confirmed these concerns) and might have led to false answering behaviors  by intention . Due to the low number of the third sex the woman/man dichotomy is preserved in this study."
"55" "Internet/Facebook"
"56" "On average, the participants stated that they spen d   about  4.7 hours a day on the Internet  (see Figure 1, left) .  Being asked  about  how many people have at least one Facebook account  in Germany , the average answer of the participants was 36.4 million.  This is slightly less than half of the German population.  Although the range of answers to the question about the number of  users  was relatively broad (see Figure 1 , right ), the mean is quite close to the  estimates  reported by the statistics portal Statista.  According to Sta tista there are 37.73 million Facebook users in 2016; estimates amount to 38.98 million and 39.97 million  F acebook  users for 2017 and 2018, respectively."
"57" "Figure 1  Fraction of Internet use and  estimation about  Facebook users"
"58" "On a 6-point scale (ranging from 1   =   never, to 6   =   several times a day), participants were asked to indicate how often they use Facebook.   Among the Facebook  users  there was an average value of 4.11 (i.e. several times a week).  Is there a relationship between  peoples’ estimation about the total number of Facebook users in Germany and their own use of Facebook?  People who frequently use Facebook may assume that there are a lot of Facebook users.  In line with the false consensus effect ,  people  might  believe that their own behavior is  quite  typical.  However, the data do es  not provide  much  evidence  in favor of this . The correlation coefficient according to Spearman is 0.0217. Given that Spearman can take values  per definition  from -1 to +1, the correlation  must  be considered to be very weak."
"59" "A fraction of  33.72% of the participants (i.e. 146 out of 433) stated that they do not use Facebook at all.  In an open  follow-up  question,  non-users  were asked  to give reasons why they refrain from u sing Facebook.  The ir  main argument was concern about data security; other  but less frequent  reasons  given include : advertising, rejecting competition for friends and likes, rejecting social media, and using alternative forms of social media (Twitter, WhatsApp,  and Instagram ).  On average, Facebook users have 300 friends  on Facebook . About six of them are on average family members.  Moreover, t he Facebook users were asked to describe their general activities in Facebook on a 5-level scale (from 1  =  strongly disagree, to 5   =   strongly agree).   Facebook is primary used  o n average  to get information about leisure activities. Less relevant seems to be the communication with friends or to be informed about activities of friends.  E ven less relevant  seems to be  making arrangements or informing about po l itics."
"60" "On average, Facebook users most often look   at headlines and short descriptions of new contributions. The frequency of reading through entire contributions or clicking on hyperlinks is much lower. Facebook users have a variety of activities at their disposal to be active on Facebook. This includes evaluating contributions, sharing contributions, and commenting on contributions. The least barrier to externally visible activities is evaluating contributions. The frequency of commenting or sharing contributions is clearly lower."
"61" "The  F acebook users were asked about  three kind s  of  information checking activities in the last 24 months : checking whether the creator of a message is an official account ( o fficial  account), checking whether the creator of a message has already published on similar topics ( s imilar  topics), and use of fact checking initiatives ( f act  checking).  Only a small fraction of the respondents claimed to  have  perform ed  these activities as a rule: official account (11.54%), similar topics (9.09%), and fact checking (3.50%). In contrast, a relatively large number of respondents stated that they  have  not carr ied  out the respective activities at all: official account (49.30%), similar topics (52.80%), and fact checking (76.57%).  Only 8.39% of the Facebook users claimed to have made a formal  complaint  about news coverage in the last 12 months.  Asking about the  topic  of the formal  complaint , the vast majority gave racism as reason.  In addition, the participants were asked how frequently they  communicate with their friends  about experiences  made with  false news stories in social media/social networks (6-point scale, ranging from  more rare than several times a year  = 1, to  daily  = 6).  A mean value of 2.48 corresponds to somewhat between  several times a year  (=2) and  once a month  (=3)."
"62" "Risk perception"
"63" "The participants were asked how  much they are worried  about their health, climate change, traffic accidents, consequences of  migration , and false news stories on the  Internet . All items were measured on a 5-point scale (ranging from 1   =   very little to 5   =   very big).   On average, the participants stated that they were least  worried  about traffic accidents and  the  consequences of migration. The topics of health  and  false news stories on the Internet are associated with more worries.   The  measured  concerns about fals e  news stories on the Internet  might be  somewhat overestimated.   Sinc e the research interest of the survey is about  false news stories  the  balk of questions we asked deals  with this specific , which might  have increased  the problem awareness of the participants  on this topic but not on the other ones .  On average, the participants reported that they were most  worried  about climate change.  We did not expect this answering behavior and can only speculate about reasons.   The study was carried out in a comparatively warm winter; maybe some media referred to climate change in this context."

"457" "Analys is of the research questions"
"458" "Evidence  o n Facebook"
"459" "Research question one addresses experiences of false news stories  made  on Facebook.  Since the term false news stories is relatively vague, the  Facebook users were asked whether they suspect to  be   in the last 2 years  in one of four concrete  situations  (cf., Table 5 , RQ1 ) .  First , the issue was presented in a false context (henceforth  false context).  Overall, 62.06% (175 out of 282) of the Facebook users said they had already been in such a situation.  In an open-answer question 155 participants specified the field in which they made such an experience. The most frequent answer was politics (n   =   124) and the second most frequent answer was sport (n   =   10).   Second , the issue was presented with a misleading headline (henceforth misleading headline). Misleading headline w as  mentioned by 66.67% of the Facebook users (i.e. 188 out of 282). Of the 155 participants who gave details, a total of 112 argued misleading headlines were prevalent in politics. The second most frequent answer  wa s , again with a huge gap to the first one, very important people.   T hird ,  the main content of an issue was misrepresented ( henceforth  main content).  It is less prevalent than the aforementioned situations; 46.26% (130 out of 281) of the Facebook users mentioned it. But the pattern is quite similar. Again politics was  given  as the most important source of this kind of false news stories ( mentioned by  86  out of  106  people  who gave details). The second most important answer was sport, which was mentioned by 11 participants.   Fourth , the content was completely fictitious (henceforth fictitious).  Only 25.45% (71 out of 279) of the Facebook users claimed to have experienced it.  P articipants gave politics as the most important source (named by 39  out of a total of 55  people  who gave details ), while the second most important one  was   sport ( named  by only 4 people)."
"460" "Which determinants  can explain   the suspicion of  being in touch with  false news stories on Facebook in the four situations? To get a rough idea, four logistic regressions  were   carried out  (cf., Table 4) .  S uspicion of false news stories is coded with 1, otherwise 0. As already mentioned, this paper is an  exploratory study. Therefore, no claim is made to generalizability and p-values are used sparingly.  Average m arginal effects  (for binary logit models)  are to be interpreted as follows:  On  average , holding other variables at  their  observed values , increasing [x-Variable] by one is expected to increase (if sign is positive)/decrease (if sign is negative) the probability of being in group Y=1 by [value in the table, the effect size] . The terms  “ on average ”   and  “ at their observed values ”   are important, but linguistically somewhat unwieldy;  even if not mentioned explicitly,  the reader should keep them  in  mind when  interpreting the regression results. We now look at the following variables (their signs and effect sizes) that  seem to be  interesting to explain the suspicion of false news stories: Political insights, Female, Fear false news, Trust human, and   Opinion others."
"461" "On  average , increasing participants ’  propensity to use Facebook to inform themselves about politics by one is expected to increase the probability to get in touch with false news stories in the regressions 1-3 by 0.035 (false context), 0.051 (misleading headline), and 0.044 (main content). This result seems plausible because people   associate politics with a field in which false news  stories  are likely  to happen . In contrast, the sign in regression IV (which explains  fictitious )   is negative (-0.042). Maybe there is a self-selection in sources: those who want to be informed about politics via  F acebook  could avoid sources that  are more likely to publish false news stories.  Being female decrease s  the probability of reporting experience with false news stories by an average of -0.072 (false context),  -0.065 (misleading headline), -0.119 (main content), and -0.110 ( f ictitious ). We can only speculate about possible reasons. Maybe women behave differently in Facebook or underestimate their ability to detect false news stories compared to men.  On average, holding other variables at their observed values, increasing fear about false news stories on the Internet by one unit is expected to increase the probability to get in touch with false news stories (false context, 0.070; misleading headline, 0.043; main content, 0.046; fictitious, 0.061). Holding other variables at their observed values, increasing the agreement to the statement that people can be trusted by one decreases the probability to be suspicious of false news stories in regressions 2-4 (misleading headline, -0.048; main content, -0.047; fictitious, -0.095). There seems to be no such effect  in regression 1 ( false context , 0.000) . On  average , increasing participants ’  agreement to the statement that it is important what other people think about one self  decreases the probability to get in touch with false news stories by  ( false context, -0.029; misleading headline, -0.024; main content, -0.046; fictitious, -0.027)."

"571" "This section deals with the perceived damage caused by false news stories on the Internet  ( cf., Table 5, RQ2 ) .  Both  items  “ Damage own ”   and  “ D amage  society ”   are measured on a 5-point scale (from very low   =   1 to very high   =   5).  Taking a look at the mean values ( D amage  own   =   2.02,  D amage  society   =   3.96) suggests that the individuals consider the damage to themselves to be rather low, whereas the damage to society is deemed to be high."
"572" "In total, 93.84% of the participants  (i.e. 396 out of  the  422  participants )   indicated   that the damage to society is higher than the damage to themselves  as individual . Only 5.45% (i.e. 23 out of 422  participants ) stated the same damage level; for 0.71% (i.e. 3 out of 422  participants ) of the respondents the individual damage predominated. Among the three participants ,  who estimated their own (relative) damage higher than the damage to society , there  are two university students enrolled in  B usiness studies and one  individual  studying  C omputer sciences. To sum up, the participants seem to be aware that society as a whole can suffer a great deal  due to false news stories . On  the  individual level, however, this perception is not prevalent; in contrast, one ’ s own concern  seems to be  rather low. This finding is interesting  because  the population of participants in the survey  itself  represents a society to a certain extent."

"692" "Detecting false news stories"
"693" "This section  takes a closer look at how p eople  describe their ability to detect Internet-based false news stories  ( cf., Table 5, RQ3 ) .  Being asked about their confidence with identif ying  false news stories in social media/social networks on a 5-point scale, ranging from very confident (=5) to very unconfident (=1), the   mean response  of the subjects  was about 3.19. This is only slightly better than  “ neither confident nor unconfident . ”"
"694" "The balk of this section ,  however ,  is about participants ’  relative  confidence in dealing with false news stories, i.e. to what extent the  participants  belie v e to recognize false news stories better or worse than an  average  university  student  of  their degree program.  They were asked to assess themselves on a 5-point  scale , ranging from  “ much better ”   (=   5) to  “ much worse ”   (=   1). The average value of 3.39 indicates a slight tendency to be better than the average.  To further analy z e this issue ,  we first take a  quick  look at gender difference s  and, in a later step, run  an  ordered logit regression to identify determinants that explain the tendency to evaluate oneself to be better than the average.  The average self-assessment of men (M=3.56, SD=0.72) exceeds that of women (M=3. 19 , SD=0.70).   As can be seen from Figure 2,  men more often than women evaluate themselves  to detect false news stories slightly better or much better than the average ."

"707" "The remaining of this section is about explaining participants ’  self-assessed ability to spot false news stories relative to an average university student  of   the same degree program  (cf., Table 6) . There are five categories, ranging from much worse (=   1) to much better (=   5).  S umming up the marginal effects for  all categories of each variable   e quals  0 bec ause an increase in probability in one category reduces  the probability in another one."
"708" "How to read th e  ordered logit  regression results of Table 6 ? Let us look at the variable  “ Female (yes   =   1 ) ”   for illustration purposes.  T he c oefficient of the ordered logit regression (-0.606) indicates that  being female  decreases the p robability  to describe oneself as  being  better than the average. To interpret the  effect size,  we  resort to m arginal effects because coefficients are often not meaningful  ( unless we  would have  deal t  with  simple  OLS ) .  On average, b eing female  de creases  a person ’ s  probability of identifying as   slightly better   by  -0.096  and  decreases the probability of identifying as  much better  by -0.029.  While we observed the expected sign,  AME after ordered logit regression  helps to explore the magnitude of the relationship.  For our research question ( identifying   determinants to explain participants ’  self-assessment as  being  better than the average) limiting ourselves to looking at columns 4 and 5 seems perfectly fine.  What ’ s about the other variables?   The variables Study semester and Internet (in h) seem to be less inter esting because the marginal effects are  quite small (i.e. less than 0.014 and 0.009, respectively).  On average, an increase the participants ’  self-assessed absolute ability to detect false news stories ( Detecting, ab s ol . ) increases the probability of identifying as slightly better by 0.098 ,  and of identifying as much better by 0.34.   The next variable (Fear false news) is quite interesting: On average, a one unit increase in being  worried  about false news stories increases a person ’ s probability of identifying as slightly better by 0.060 ,  and of identifying as much better by 0.020.   The relationship of the perceived damage seems to be context dependent. On average, increasing Damage own by one is associated with a -0.041 decrease in the probability of identifying as slightly better and a -0.014 decrease in the probability of identifying as much better. In contrast, the sign is positive for Damage society but its effect size is a little bit smaller.  Let us now take a look at the personality traits  ( Trust humans, Opinion others, Optimism, and Happiness ) .  Roughly  speaking, the first three personality traits help to (slightly) reduce the part i cipants ’  tendency to describe themselves as better than the average. The marginal effect of Opinion others is most pronounced of them ( but the  marginal change is smaller than  - 0.03 3  in magnitude). In contrast ,   H appiness does not seem to matter at all (i.e. marginal effect is  very close to or  even  zero).  The study programs the participants are enrolled does reveal some interesting insights. First of all, note that the study program  “ History ”   serves as benchmark and therefore  is  dropped out because we can only deal with n-1  variables.  On  average , being enrolled in  B usiness  studies increases the probability of identifying as slightly better by 0.095 and identifying as much better by 0.40. The same level of the marginal effects (with the exception of very minor differences in the 4th category) holds true for university students that are enrolled in  L aw . The same sign can be found with university students enrolled in  P olitics . However, their effect sizes are almost only one- sixth compared to the degree programs  Business  studies and  Law . The  AME  is a zero effect  with   C omputer  science students."
"709" "To sum up, important drivers that help to describe the better than average phenomenon are:  gender, perceived ability to detect false news stories  ( “ absolute level ” ),  fear of false news stories, and the degree program ( Business  studies,  Law ) ."

"850" "Research question four  is related to designing an information ecosystem. It is about institutions that  are  responsible  for the factually correct presentation of information and content   ( cf., Table 5, RQ4 ) .   Participants were asked to evaluate the  responsibility of the  three institutions government/justice (henceforth Government), Operators of platforms/portals (henceforth Operator), and Users of platforms/portals (henceforth User) on a 5-point scale, ranging from  strongly disagree (=   1)  to   strongly agree (=   5) .  On average, the participants agreed most strongly with the statement that operators are responsible (M   =   3.96).  The perceived responsibility of the User (M   =   3.72) is somewhat  lower and the  perceived responsibility   of the  Government (M   =   3.19) is considerably lower  (cf., Table 5, RQ4 ) . However, this question may be answered differently by individuals from different degree programs.

"893" "In Table  7 ,   the agreement to the statements  “ Government is responsible ” ,  “ User is responsible ” ,  and  “ Operator is responsible ”   to provide  factually correct information   is differentiated by degree programs.  On average, the university students of the degree programs  B usiness  studies,  L aw ,  H istory ,   and  P olitics  consider the operators of platforms  to be  most responsible.  Only  university students   who are enrolled in  C omputer  sciences  do   not to see the greatest responsibility in operators; they attribute the greatest responsibility to users.  The lowest average responsibility over all degree programs is attributed to the institution government.  At least with the  university  students   of L aw  one could have expected something different. Of course, we cannot rule out the possibility that  L aw  students in higher semesters would have stated otherwise. More courses at the university could lead them to believe in the effectiveness of the law (possibly due to the one-sided orientation of a course of study, which can lead in some way to systemic blindness).  It is also worth mentioning that t he  attitude that the  government is the responsible  institution  to provide factually correct information is particularly low among university students of  C omputer sciences  (M   <   3).   To sum up, the university students across the degree programs seem to lack confidence in government. Trust in operators and users are ,  on  average ,  more prevalent."
"894" "In the following we want to econometrically identify variables that may explain the participants ’  stated preferences towards responsibilities of the  three institutions  government, operator, and user  (cf., Table 8) .  Which conditions favor the participants  to   agree  that the respective  institutions  are responsible  to combat  false news stories?  The dependent variable has five categories (strongly dis a gree =  1 , disagree =  2 , neither agree, nor di s agree =   3, agree   =   4, strongly agree   =   5) for all institutions.  For our research purpose, it is  sufficient to have a closer look at the categories four and five  only, with a focus on the latter category because this is the most extensive agreement to the responsibility statement .  To make the presentation concise and line with the research question, only these  two  categories are presented in  T able  8  (for a detailed presentation, see Appendix)."

"1021" "(a)  History serves as a benchmark for  the other degree programs (B usiness studies,  C omputer sciences,  L aw, and  Politics)."
"1022" "On average,  being  female  is  expected to increase the probability to strongly agree with government  to be responsible  by 0.051; the same holds with operator s  but to a lower magnitude (0.024). In contrast, women seem to reject user  to be responsible to some extent (-0.110).  The  exogenous   Study semester ,  Internet (in h) , and  Fear false news  do not  seem to explain much of the part i cipants ’  probability to (strongly) agree with the three institutions. Their marginal changes are quite low in magnitude over all three regressions.  Increasing  Detecting, absol.  by one unit is expected to increase the probability of identifying with  the  strongly agree  category  in the operator and user contexts by 0.022 and 0.067, respectively. The latter indic a tes that trusting in  onesel f   is positively related with user responsibility. The correlation of  Detecting, absol.  with the participant s ’  agreement  to the statement that the government is responsible  seems to be negligible low.   I ncreasing  Damage own  by one unit, on average, is expected to increase the probability of identifying with the strong ly  agree category in the second (i.e. responsibility of the operator) regression by 0.034. In the other regressions the magnitude of the marginal effect is relatively low (0.011, government; -0.003, user).   Roughly speaking, if participants evaluate their own damage through false news stories  as  high, they do not ask for government or user, but  tend to  see the operator in charge .  Facing an increase in the perceived  Damage society , people are expected to increase the probability to be in line with the strongly  agree  category by 0.035 (government), 0.050 (operator), and 0.048 (user).  Let us now look at some personality traits and the degree programs. While  Trust humans  does not seem to matter much in regression one and two, there is an interesting correlation in regression three (i.e. the institution where the user is responsible). Increasing  Trust humans  by one unit is, on average, expected to increase  the probability of  identifying with the strongly agree category  by 0.039 .  On average, increasing  Opinion others  by one is associated with an increase in the probability to identify with the strongly agree category in all regressions. The effect sizes ranges from 0.011 to 0.019 in magnitude. There seems to be a mixed picture with the variable  Optimism . While the marginal effect of  Optimism   is close to zero  in regression one (-0.001), the effect is positive in regression two (0.019),  but   negative and relatively high in magnitude (-0.048)   in regression three.  On average, an increase in  Happiness  by one does increase the probability of identifying with the strongly agree category in  regression one and two (0.012 and 0.013, respectively), but decrease the probability of identifying with the strongly agree category in regression three (-0.006).  To interpret the correlations of the degree programs, it is important to remember that the degree program History serves as a benchmark (and is therefore not included in the three regressions). Being enrolled in either  Business Studies ,  Computer sciences ,  Law  or  Politics  does reduce the probability of identifying  with  the category strongly agree in the regressions one (government) and two (operators ) . The average marginal effect is high with Computer Sciences in regression  two . The third regression, which deals with users, seems to be different. While there are also negative signs with Computer Sciences (-0.035) and Politics     (-0.038), the average marginal effect of Law is small but positive (0.009). Most notably, the marginal effect of Business studies is relatively high (0.036). This indicates that university students enrolled in  B usiness studies are relatively open-minded to the responsibility of users."
"1023" "Conclusions"
"1024" "False news stories, sometimes referred to as fake news, are currently controversially discussed.  This paper  addressed this topic by  empirically analyz ing the  experiences ,  attitudes , and opinions about  responsibilities   of university students .  Due to a lack of prior knowledge, this is an  explorat ory   study. Thus, there is no claim to generalize the findings to a larger population.  However, several interesting correlations could be identified which may be of interest for  further   research. In particular ,  the following general hypotheses can be derived from the study with university students:"
"1025" "1 Facebook users are more likely to be suspicious of false news stories if they are interested  in political topics.  People are less likely to detect false news stories the stronger they trust  in others and the more emphasis they put on the opinions of others."
"1026" "2 False news stories are perceived as a problem at the societal level, but  are  not bother ed   much at the individual level."
"1027" "3 Men  more often  than women  believe to be in touch with false news stories; men  overestimate their ability to spot false news stories.  People who fear false news stories are likely to believe that they could detect such news better than the average."
"1028" "4 People do not trust government/justice (e.g. tightening laws) as institution to  combat  false  news stories on the Internet. Instead, people see operators of platforms (e.g. Facebook) as  well as users of platforms responsible against false news stories."
"1029" "Let us carry out a cross  comparison  and contrast the  issue   of  false news stories with food quality monitoring. In food quality monit o ring there are well-defined standards. In addition, the number of food firms is relatively robust. Furthermore, non-compliance with laws may be not only  be  punished by the government but also by food consumers. The context of false news stories seems to be different. Information on the Internet is available in  a  great diversity and complexity. An individual is unlikely to be able to check up on the mass of information.  Correcting false news stories can backfire by repeating them."
"1030" "T here is a challenge to design an effective  and efficient  information ecosystem. Insights from behavioral economics may be a good starting point.  Just to name a few ideas: (i) To increase informed commenting/sharing/liking contributions, social networks may urge the user to read more than the headline s  (e.g. enable user activities  only  if the contribution is at least clicked on). (ii) From time to time rem in ders may be quite useful: social networks could warn of false news stories and inappropriate content, and show how to report contributions. Keeping procedures simple but stressing the social benefits should be  guidelines . (iii) Users could be nudged to rethink their  subscribed  pages and persons: by logging in into social media,  smart hints (e.g. on restructuring of subscribed stuff) may limit the amount of pages, which are only screened superficially."

"1603" "Dear students,"
"1604" "the topic of \"false news stories on the Internet\" is currently (sometimes under the notion of \"fake news\") controversially discussed. Social media and social networks (e.g. \"Facebook\") generate a large bulk of information that seems neither completely comprehensible nor verifiable in its abundance. As part of a research project at the MLU Halle-Wittenberg we want to better understand the topic of \"false news stories.\" We are therefore carrying out a survey today that focuses in particular on your user behavior and your experiences in social networks. The survey takes about 12-15 minutes of your time. Participation is  voluntary ,   of course. The collected data will be treated strictly confidential. It is not possible to draw conclusions about individuals."
