The Scientific Revolution is one of the most important phenomena in human history. Yet it is ill understood, partly because of
a lack of quantification. Here, we leverage large datasets of individual biographies to build national estimates of scientific production during the early modern period. While aggregate levels of national production are unsurprising, per capita estimates
reveal striking differences across countries, with the two richest
countries of the time (England and the United Provinces) being much more scientifically productive than the rest of Europe.
Overall, our study demonstrates a strong association between
scientific creativity and per capita income. We also show that
scientific creativity is associated with other kinds of creative activities in philosophy, literature, music and the arts, suggesting a
common underlying factor. Our results also challenge long-held
hypotheses regarding the role of religion, universities, demography, and the printing press, and support the idea that economic
development and rising living standards are key to explaining
the rise of modern science.

Table 1. Scientists ranked by the importance of their contributions to the advancement of science

The Scientific Revolution represents a turning point in the
history of humanity. In the space of a few decades, it
transformed the nature of knowledge and the capacities of
humankind (Cohen, 2012, Mokyr, 2016, Wootton, 2015).
"Without it," writes historian of science David Wootton,
"there would have been no Industrial Revolution and none
of the modern technologies on which we depend; human life
would be drastically poorer and shorter and most of us would
live lives of unremitting toil." (Wootton, 2015).
A large number of explanations have been put forward
to explain the origins of the Scientific Revolution (for a review, see Cohen (1994)), from the belief in a divine legislator
(Grant and Grant, 1996, Needham, 1981, Stark, 2007) to the
role of medieval universities (Grant and Grant, 1996, Huff,
2017) and from political freedom (Mokyr, 2016, Needham,
1981) and to the invention of the printing press (Eisenstein,
1980, Wootton, 2015). However, testing these theories with
only qualitative data is difficult. So far "there is no general
agreement on what the Scientific Revolution is, why it happened – or even whether there was such a thing” (Wootton,
2015).
However, thanks to the growing size of online datasets, it
is now possible to quantifying cultural production over time
in science as well as in the arts (Fraiberger et al., 2018, Gergaud et al., 2017, Schich et al., 2014, Serafinelli and Tabellini,
2017, Sinatra et al., 2016). In this paper, we use the biographies of Wikipedia to quantify scientific production. In doing

so we include all individuals who are classified as scientists in
Wikipedia during the early modern period: mathematicians,
astronomers, geographers, physicists, biologists, naturalists,
chemists, botanists, entomologists, and zoologists. The use
of large datasets like this one make it possible to go beyond
key figures such as Newton and Galileo and take into account
the thousands of individuals who contributed to the rise of
science (see Table 1). In the same way, it allows us to incorporate not only the discovery of the law of gravitation or
the moons of Jupiter, but also the hundreds of mathematical
theorems and astronomical discoveries that paved the way for
the major breakthroughs of the Scientific Revolution.
Importantly for science, datasets like Wikipedia also convey an implicit estimate of the significance of a cultural product: the more numerous the productions of an individual, and
the more important they were in the light of modern people,
the bigger the biography. As such these estimates are very
similar to the modern bibliometric assessment of scientific
productivity, because the value of a scientific contribution is
estimated by the later generations of scientists and editors of
Wikipedia (see Table 1).
A further advantage of Wikipedia is that it is edited by
thousands of editors, rather than by a single author or a small
team of authors. For instance, the page for Galileo has been
edited by 2931 different editors (excluding bots) since its
creation in 2001. Even the pages of minor figures such as

Fig. 1. National Scientific Production per capita (1500 – 1850) The economic leadership of The Netherlands (pink) and the United Kingdom (blue) in terms of per capita GDP
(>1500 dollars per capita and positive growth) coincides with their leadership in per capita scientific production

Jean de Hautefeuille (1646-1724, French physicist), Thomas
Johnson (1595 – 1644, English botanist) or Joachim Jungius
(1597-1657, German mathematician) have been edited by
more than 30 different contributors. This guarantees that the
database has not been built with a particular hypothesis in
mind. In fact, many methodological decisions were made
by the editors of Wikipedia. For instance, for each individual, Wikipedia provides one or several “occupations” (writer,
painter, theologian, etc.). This label allows us to distinguish
between individuals who truly contributed to science (e.g.
Ptolemy, Newton) and those who merely commented on or
recorded the advances of science (e.g. Pliny the Elder, Roger
Bacon, Thomas Huxley) without biasing the sample.
Combining Wikipedia entries from several different languages also allows us to limit anglocentric bias. Given the
current size and influence of American and other Englishlanguage communities of historians of science compared to
French-, German- or Italian-speaking communities, it could
be the case that scientific contributions made by English people have been overestimated, because they are more easily
accessible to English-speaking historians than the scientific
contributions made in other languages. To counteract this potential bias, we used the three Wikipedias (English, German
and French) whose Wikipedia communities had established
lists of writers, scientists, and artists by century and nationality.

mates of scientific production for each country (see Methods
below). Per capita estimates are crucial if we want to estimate
levels of innovation in particular countries. For instance,
we tend to consider that, in the modern period, Italy (with
Galileo and Torricelli), England (with Newton and Boyle)
and France (with Pascal and Descartes) were more or less
equally productive scientifically (see Figure 15). But this
assessment overlooks the fact that in 1650, France had 16
million people, Italy 12 million, and England only 3 million. In other words, for England to contribute as much to
the Scientific Revolution, it had to be much more productive
than France or Italy. As we will demonstrate, some smaller
countries, such as the Netherlands or Scandinavia, were even
more productive than England. However, current qualitative
estimates of total national productivity fail to capture their
productivity.

Results
Per Capita National Scientific Production. We calculated

estimates of per capita National Scientific Production in different countries (see Fig. 1) with the Netherlands leading
in the 17th century, followed by England in the 18th century. During the Scientific Revolution, these countries were
much more productive than Germany, France or Italy on a per
capita basis. The relative decline of Italy is visible from the
early 17th century on, starting during Galileo’s lifetime. The
late rise of Germany’s scientific productivity is also visible,

and foreshadows the success of German science in physics,
technology and chemistry at the end of the 19th century. Finally, although Scandinavia remained a small player during
the early modern period due to its small population size, it
was among the most productive countries from 1700 onward.
The same trend are also visible in the spatial distribution of
scientists. As Figure 2 shows, scientific production was extremely concentrated in the most dynamic cities (Rome, London, Paris, Amsterdam, Florence and Venice) and shifted toward the North-West during the 17th and 18th c.
The picture painted by these results differs considerably
from the one derived from national totals (see Fig. 3). National estimates are distorted by the population size of countries. Such rankings thus do not tell us which country was the
most productive at the individual level in 1700. If we were
to use them in 2019, they would highlight the production of

China rather than Switzerland or Singapore.
It is worth nothing that the high productivity of the Netherlands is visible both across indexes (bytes, languages, quotations) and across Wikipedia languages (see Fig. 4). During
their Golden Age, the Dutch were more productive than the
rest of Europe regardless of the choice of indicator. This is
also the case for England in the 18th century, with the exception of two of the German indicators.
This pattern could conceivably have resulted from a few
outliers such as Newton and Huygens, whose fame might
have biased the results in favor of England or Holland. This
pattern could also have resulted from the overrepresentation
of editors speaking English or Dutch, potentially leading
to the creation of many biographies of minor scientists and
thereby to an inflation of the productivity of England or Holland. To find out whether this was the case, we performed the

same analysis for the top 10% of scientists and for the bottom
90%. We found that the pattern remained very similar in both
cases (see Figs. 5 and 6).
Another potential bias is due to the fact that England and
the Netherlands are smaller than Italy, France and Germany.
It could thus be the case that their high productivity was due
to the fact that similarly highly productive areas in France
(such as Ile-de-France) or Italy (such as Tuscany) were hidden within bigger areas. To account for this possibility, we

combined England, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, the Netherlands
and Belgium into a larger unit as “Northwestern Europe”,
with a combined population of 12.5 million people in 1700
(compared to 22 million for France, 13 million for Germany,
and 13 million for Italy). The pattern, although less spectacular, is substantially similar: Northwestern Europe comes out
as the scientific leader from 1550 to 1800 (see Fig. 7).
Another potential bias is that, in Wikipedia, some very notable people such as Goethe are included in lists of scientists

Table 2. Association Between Environmental variables and Scientific Creativity

Accounting for the origins of scientific productivity.

Our results suggest that economic development and living
standards are key to explaining scientific productivity. To
further investigate this relationship, we tested the association
between scientific production and two proxies for living standards: GDP per capita and urbanization rate. To investigate
the link between environmental variables and scientific production, we built robust linear mixed models, whose results
are displayed in Table 2. The dependent variable is the scientific production per capita, measured for each country each
50 year (to avoid any overlap between the datapoints) and for
our 9 indicators (language, bytes and links). Each model has

two fixed effect. First, the one mentioned in the columns,
whose coefficient and associated p-value figured in the table 2 (population, GDP per capita, number of universities per
capita, number of sitting days of Parliament). Second, we
added the date as a covariate to (1) control for a potential historiographic bias, overstating the scientific production in the
latest studied period because of the abundance of sources,
and (2) to avoid a spurious correlation between affluence and
scientific production, due to the fact that both affluence and
scientific production tend to increase with time. As random
effects, we added the country (to account for the fact that the
data points associated to the same country are not fully independent), and the method used to measure scientific production (the Wikipedia language and the proxy (bytes, languages
or links). To avoid any spurious result due to autoregressive
components, heteroskedasticity or non-normality of residuals, we used robust regressions provided by the R package
robustlmm. Finally, to prevent any false positive to stem from
the number of tests, we applied a Bonferroni correction.
The results show a strong association between per capita
scientific production and per capita GDP, book titles, and
lifespan (see Table 2). Remarkably, the period of Dutch and
English domination matches their period of maximum affluence during the studied period (i.e. the period during which
their GDP per capita was over $2,000 and their economic activity was growing, see Fig. 1).
We also consider alternative hypotheses. We first consider
the role of religion. Protestantism has been seen as an important factor in the emergence of modern science. Following
Max Weber’s famous claim on the link between the Protestant work ethic and the capitalist economy, Robert K. Merton
argued for a similar positive correlation between the rise of
English Puritanism, as well as German Pietism, and early experimental science. He noted, for instance that seven of 10
founding members of the Royal Society were Puritans and
that, in the year 1663, 62 percent of the members of the Royal
Society were identified as Puritans (for more recent works on
the importance of religions, see also (Harrison, 2001, LINDBERG, 1986)).
To test this idea, we created two groups of countries based
on their religious affiliation at the end of the wars of religions (Peace of Westphalia, 1648), when religious affiliations get more stable. Unsurprisingly, Protestant countries
appear to be more productive than Catholic countries (Fig.
9). However, this higher level of productivity appears to predate rather than follow the beginning of the Protestant Reformation by more than half a century.
To computed the date of divergence between Protestant and Catholic countries, we used the function “breakpoints” of the R package “strucchange” [https://cran.rproject.org/web/packages/strucchange/strucchange.pdf]. It
follows the methodology of the Chow test: for each date, the
"Chow statistic" is computed, following this formula:
F=

Sc −(S1 +S2 )
(S1 +S2 )/(n−4)

(Sc being the residual sum of squares for the initial model,

|

S1 and S2 the ones for the model fitted respectively on the
first and second group of observations, and n the total number
of observations)
Intuitively, the statistic represents how much the fit is improved if, instead of fitting an OLS regression for the whole
dataset, we fit one for the points anterior to this date and one
for the posterior ones. Under the null hypothesis (i.e. the two
regression lines have the same intercept and the same slope),
F/2 follows a Fisher distribution with 2 and n − 4 degrees
of freedom. It allows to compute a p-value for each possible
date, quantifying how unlikely it is that the data have been
generated by the same process before and after this date. The
chosen breakpoint is the one that maximises the Chow statistics (and thus minimises the p value). It is not the only point
where there is a significant structural change, but rather the
point where a split maximally improves the fit. Also, it is
important to understand that this analysis does not mean that
there is a “burst” or a big variation at the time of the breakpoint. In fact, the position of the breakpoint can change a lot
if additional years are added at the beginning and at the end
of the studied period - such analysis is very sensitive to the
period considered. In other words, it is not a local analysis,
but a global one.
If the spread of protestantism had triggered a behavioral
change, then we would likely see a significant breakpoint at
this moment. Instead, the optimal breakpoint computed by
the Chow test is located in 1480, that 37 years before the
beginning of the Protestant Reformation. In light of these results, it can be hypothesized that the Protestant Reformation
is not at the origin of the Scientific Revolution, but is rather a
product of a larger cultural change that occurred in Northern
Europe in the 15th and 16th centuries and that caused both
the Protestant Reformation and the Scientific Revolution.

We then considered the role of printing. Printing has often been cited as a cause of the Scientific Revolution, as it
allows for better communication between scientists (Eisenstein, 1980, Febvre and Martin, 1997, Wootton, 2015). Although the increase in scientific productivity coincides with
the invention and diffusion of printing in Europe, there is no
breakpoint associated with the invention of printing. When
we consider the interval 1300 - 1600 (that is the most fa6

|

vorable to detect a breakpoint associated with the invention
of printing by Gutenberg in 1440), the breakpoint that maximises the Chow statistics is 1400, that is several decades before the invention of printing (Fig. 11).
Furthermore, the asymmetry of the growth of scientific
productivity in Northern and Southern Europe (Fig. 9) suggests that its role in the Scientific Revolution was minor.
Scientific productivity in the less dynamic parts of Europe
(Italy, Spain, Portugal, southern France) does not seem to
have been much affected by the invention of printing despite
its widespread use (for instance, Venice built its first press in
1469 and had 417 printers in 1500) (see Fig. 10). This divergence between Northern and Southern Europe points toward an alternative theory in which printing is seen not as
an exogenous invention but rather as an endogenous output
of dynamic societies. In fact the divergence between the dynamic North and the stagnant South parallel the economic
‘little divergence’ observed by economic historians (De Pleijt
and Van Zanden, 2016).
One important hypothesis in cultural evolution is that the
probability of innovations being discovered and maintained
through social learning is greater in large populations than
in small ones (Collard et al., 2013, Henrich, 2004, Kremer,
1993, Shennan, 2001). Our results, however, suggest that, at
least in science, population size does not play an important
role in explaining per capita scientific productivity. Small societies such as England, Holland and Scotland, despite their
limited population, were much more innovative than larger
societies such as France, Italy or Russia (see Table 2).
We also examined the impact of universities. Medieval
universities are often seen as an institutional innovation that
acted as a major driver of scientific improvement (Grant and
Grant, 1996, Huff, 2017). This hypothesis particularly favored when comparing European institutions of higher education and scholarship with their equivalents in Muslim,
Indian and Chinese societies (Grant and Grant, 1996, Huff,
2017). Moreover, it is true that the timing of the take-off of
European science matches with the creation of the major European universities (Bologna, Paris, Oxford). To test this hypothesis, we extended our study to the medieval period (500 –
1500). Our results show that when demography is taken into
account, no significant breakpoint in the increase of scientific
production can be detected during the peak period of university foundations (1100-1500) (see Fig. 12). Also, there is
no association between scientific productivity and number of
universities, suggesting that universities did not in fact play
an important role in the Scientific Revolution (see Table 2).
This result is in line with what can be observed outside
Europe. For instance, the diffusion of printed books did not
drastically change China’s scientific productivity during the
Tang dynasty (Xu, 2017), or that of the Ottoman Empire in
the 17th century (Coşgel et al., 2012). By contrast, it is worth
noting that Ancient Greece achieved a level of productivity
often deemed similar to that of early modern Europe despite
the absence of printing.
Finally, we tested the association between scientific innovation and political freedom or inclusive institutions (Ace-

(Huff, 2017, Mokyr, 2016, Wootton, 2015). It stands to reason that, on this view, science should develop more easily
in societies with more inclusive institutions, and where individuals enjoy greater freedom. In line with these ideas, our
results show a strong association between per capita scientific
production and the activity of parliaments.

tendency to defer to others’ judgments (Baumard, 2018, Inglehart and Welzel, 2005, Jacquet et al., 2018, Nettle, 2018).
This behavioral approach to creativity suggests that individuals in affluent environments should be more innovative in
science, but also in all kinds of activities, because the tradeoffs between exploration and social learning are similar (Baumard, 2018). We thus look at other kind of creative activities,
such as literature, philosophy, painting, sculpture and music,
and build a general per capita “Cultural Domestic Product”.
In this index, scientists account for a small minority of the
sample (13.2), compared to painters (40.8), writers (29) and
musicians (10.1) (see Table 5). The pattern for cultural production is strikingly similar to the pattern of scientific production, with the Netherlands and then Britain leading (see
Fig. 11). This suggests a common general cause behind scientific, literary, and artistic production, a “culture of growth”
(Mokyr, 2016).
We also look at the correlation between cultural production and living standards using a method similar as for scientific production. Aftre correcting for multiple comparison
(Bonferroni correction), the results reveal a strong association between per capita cultural production and per capita
GDP, book titles, and lifespans (see Table 3). Finally, to test
the prediction that all forms of cultural productions are associated to a common underlying creativity factor, we used
the same robust linear mixed models to measure how much
the individual cultural productions predict one another, while
controlling for time, proxy and country, and correcting the
p-values by Bonferroni method (see Table 4).

tific Revolution shows that scientific productivity was unevenly distributed in Europe, and that the most affluent countries, such as England and the Netherlands were more scientifically advanced than the rest of Europe. It is important to
note that these results are in keeping with more qualitative
modern assessments by historians of science (Rossi, 2001,
Wootton, 2015)). They also fit with the observations of contemporaries. For instance, Voltaire, began his discussion of
“great men” with the three greatest—all of them English: Bacon, Locke, and Newton (Mokyr, 2016, p. 68). Similarly,
when Count Marsigli of Bologna visited the Royal Society in
1721, he was struck by the difference between Italy and England with regard to science: “[A]ll speculation unsupported
by observation or experiment is utterly rejected. In England
all study and teaching is based on fact” (cited in(Wootton,
2015)). As Mokyr demonstrates in The Enlightened Economy: An Economic History of Britain 1700-1850 (2012),
contemporary intellectuals had a clear perception that England was ahead of its time.
In The Invention of Science, David Wootton emphasizes
how advanced England was compared to the rest of Europe
in 1730, the year of the publication of Voltaire’s Letters Concerning the English Nation. His description of the new mentality of the English people is worth citing at length:
The message of Voltaire’s book was that England had a distinctive scientific culture: what
was true of an educated Englishman in 1733
would not be true of a Frenchman, an Italian,
a German or even a Dutchman. Our Englishman has looked through a telescope and a microscope; he owns a pendulum clock and a stick
barometer – and he knows there is a vacuum at
the end of the tube. He does not know anyone
(or at least not anyone educated and reasonably
sophisticated) who believes in witches, werewolves, magic, alchemy or astrology; he thinks
the Odyssey is fiction, not fact. He is confident
that the unicorn is a mythical beast. He does not
believe that the shape or colour of a plant has any
significance for an understanding of its medical
use. He believes that no creature large enough
to be seen by the naked eye is generated spontaneously – not even a fly. He does not believe in

the weapon salve or that murdered bodies bleed
in the presence of the murderer. (. . . ) He believes the future cannot be predicted. He knows
that the heart is a pump. He has seen a steam
engine at work. He believes that science is going to transform the world and that the moderns
have outstripped the ancients in every possible
respect. He has trouble believing in any miracles, “even the ones in the Bible”. (Wootton,
2015, p. 68)
This qualitative description concords with our own results,
demonstrating a very high level of scientific productivity of
England at the time, a phenomenon that, far from being reducible to few outliers such as Newton or Boyle, encompasses dozens of lesser-known scientists.
The nature of the Scientific Revolution. Our study of the
Scientific Revolution also reveals that, from a purely quantitative perspective, there was in fact no abrupt Scientific Revolution at all. This is visible in the Europe’s overall scientific
production from 600 to 1850. Figure 13 shows a continuous
acceleration of scientific production from at least the 11th
century, and makes clear that there was in fact no sharp inflection point during this period.

Figure 13 may thus lead us to question the very idea of
the “Scientific Revolution”. In the absence of quantitative
measurements, we may easily be tempted to focus on a few
discoveries such as the theory of heliocentrism, the theory
of gravitation, or the binomial nomenclature. We may be
drawn to a conceptualization of the Scientific Revolution as
a shift between two radically different kinds of intellectual
activities: from myth to science, from tradition to innovation,
or from conformism to inventiveness. But there were much
more than a few macro-discoveries during the Scientific Revolution. There were also hundreds of less important and yet
crucial discoveries, from the moons of Jupiter, to the vacuum
pump, to the circulation of the blood, to binomial classification. Adopting a quantitative perspective, including not only
the large steps but all the smaller steps that also mattered in
de Courson & Baumard

Quantifying the Scientific Revolution

the advancement of science, reveals more continuity than discontinuity.
From this perspective, the acceleration of scientific production is very similar to the acceleration of economic productivity observed during the same period (see Fig. 14, and
(Roser, 2014)), which leads us to question a similar, historically connected concept: the Industrial Revolution. In terms
of GDP per capita over time, the Industrial Revolution hardly
looks like a revolution in the sense that there is no noticeable
breakpoint in per capita GDP.
One possible lesson from such quantitative findings is that
while labels such as the “Scientific Revolution” can serve to
raise awareness about a phenomenon (the acceleration of scientific production), they can be misleading when it comes to
actually understanding it. Such labels tend to dichotomize
the world (e.g., pre-scientific vs. scientific) when in reality
change is continuous (i.e., varying amounts and intensities of
innovation) (Baumard, 2019). In other words, 18th-century
England was “more scientific” (in the sense of being scientifically more productive) than 17th-century England, but 17thcentury England was also more scientific than 16th-century
England, and so on.
This does not mean that there is nothing to be explained.
The exponential rise in innovativeness still requires an explanation (André and Baumard, 2019, Enquist et al., 2008,
Mesoudi, 2011). But we should not assume that the Scientific
Revolution was an “event” or even a “short period.” Instead
it is part of a very general process of acceleration of cultural
evolution, which is the phenomenon that requires an explanation. What made people more innovative? Was it new institutions, new technologies, new ideas or, as we have suggested,
increasing living standards? To answer this question, we first
need more data, especially on innovativeness (see below).
Note also that this conclusion is compatible with a qualitative change in people’s view of science and knowledge
(Wootton, 2015). The gradual increase of scientific production may have led to a tipping point at which people realized
that, for instance, genuine progress (and not just the recovery of the knowledge of the past) was possible, or that there
was indeed a set of practices (science) that could be isolated
from the rest of culture. The possibility of relatively rapid
qualitative changes in people’s views of scientific production is compatible with gradual change in scientific productivity itself. The same phenomenon occured for economic
growth: it took several centuries (up to the mid-19th century)
for economists to realize that per capita production was increasing in England (McCloskey, 2006).
A new mentality?. Our results suggest that rising living

standards and economic prosperity further the advancement
of science: scientific productivity was higher in the most affluent countries, and there is a positive association between
living standards and both scientific and artistic productivity.
One conclusion from these results is that the Scientific Revolution is simply the output of economic development: as
Aristotle noted more than two thousand years ago, prosperity gives individuals more time and resources to engage in
innovative activity.

The history of science, however, suggests that there was
more than simply more time and more resources behind scientific advances. In his account of the Scientific Revolution,
David Wootton (2015) observes that, in many cases, what
prevented people from advancing their knowledge was not a
lack of time or money, but the inability to question authorities.
Mondino de Liuzzi (1270–1326), for example,
the author of the first medieval textbook on how
to perform a dissection, had plenty of hands-on
experience, but he still found at the base of the
human brain the rete mirabile (miraculous network) of blood vessels that Galen claimed was
there, despite the fact that it isn’t there at all –
it is only present in ungulates. Leonardo carried
out dissections, but he still thought he found a
channel linking the male penis to the spinal cord
and so to the brain: down it he believed flowed
material which became part of the ejaculate and
was essential for generation. The first anatomist
regularly to disagree with Galen on the basis
of direct experience was Jacopo Berengario da
Carpi, whose Anatomy was published in 1535,
only a few years before Vesalius’s Fabric. Only
in a culture where the authority of the great classical authors such as Ptolemy and Galen had be10

|

gun to be undermined could a project like Vesalius’s Fabric be undertaken. (Wootton, 2015,
p.335)
Wootton makes a similar point about the 19th-century revolution in medicine. He points out that the germ theory of disease could have been discovered much earlier than the 19th
century.
The primary obstacle to progress, as I have argued, was not practical (Leeuwenhoek’s microscopes worked well), nor theoretical (the germ
theory of putrefaction was not difficult to formulate), but psychological and cultural. It lay in
doctors’ sense of themselves, their awareness of
their own traditions, their habit of conferring authority upon an established canon and upon established therapies. (2015, p.286)
More generally, as Wootton points out, before the 16th and
17th centuries, history was assumed to repeat itself, and tradition taken to provide a reliable guide to the future. The
greatest achievements of civilization were believed to lie not
in the present or the future but in the past, in ancient Greece
and classical Rome. By contrast, a new optimistic attitude
toward the future and the possibility of progress gradually
emerged in the 16th century.
This new attitude was summed up by Louis Le Roy (or
Regius, 1510–77) in 1575:

Quantifying the Scientific Revolution

[T]here remayne more thinges to be sought out,
then are alreadie invented, and founde. And let
us not be so simple, as to attribute so much unto
the Auncients, that wee beleeve that they have
knowen all, and said all; without leaving anything to be said, by those that should come after
them.... Let us not thinke that nature hath given
them all her good gifts, that she might be barren
in time to come: ... How many [secrets of nature]
have bin first knowen and found out in this age?
I say, new lands, new seas, new formes of men,
maners, lawes, and customes; new diseases, and
new remedies; new waies of the Heaven, and
of the Ocean, never before found out; and new
starres seen? yea, and how many remaine to be
(cited in (Wootton, 2015, p.118)).
A similar attitude can be found in writings by Bacon,
Descartes and Galileo (Rossi, 2001, Wootton, 2015). This is
reflected in the titles of the scientific books of the time: Nova
de universis philosophia (Patrizi, 1591), Novo theatro de machine (Zonca, 1607), Astronomia nova (Kepler, 1609), Discursi intorno a due nuove scienze (Galileo, 1638), De mundo
nostro sublunari philosophia nova (Gilbert, 1651). During
the 17th century, more than a hundred books used the term
novus in their title (Thorndike, 1971). As Mokyr (2016)
notes, they no longer subscribed to “the Ecclesiastes view
of history,” which holds that long-term change is impossible,
because “there is nothing new under the sun.”
Not only were 17th c. intellectuals more optimistic, but
they were also more open to creativity and innovation. As
McCloskey notes, words such as “innovation” and “novelty”
often used to have negative connotations before the 17th c..
yet, these same words started to look more positive, and emotional attachment to traditional ways of doing things progressively decreased (McCloskey, 2016, p.94).
These examples suggest that the cultural change that occurred during the period conventionally identified as the Scientific Revolution consisted at least partially in changes in
mindset or mentality. One illustration of the mindset hypothesis is that, more often than not, the obstacles to the
spread of the new scientific ideas are psychological, rather
than technical (e.g., the need for a new instrument) or economic (e.g., the need for more education, time, books, etc.).
For instance, Galileo tells the story of a professor who refused to accept that the nerves were connected to the brain
rather than the heart because this was at odds with Aristotle’s explicit statement—and stood his ground even when he
was shown the pathways of the nerves in a dissected cadaver
(Wootton, 2015). There is also the famous example of the
philosopher Cremonini, who, despite being a close friend of
Galileo, refused to look through his telescope for the simple reason that Aristotle did not use telescopes, and therefore
they were irrelevant (Wootton, 2015).
Another argument in favor of the mindset hypothesis is
that this shift in views on the progress of science predate actual scientific progress. In his famous study on the decline of
magic, Keith Thomas noted that:
de Courson & Baumard

|

Quantifying the Scientific Revolution

In many different spheres of life, the period saw
the emergence of a new faith in the potentialities
of human initiative. (. . . ) The change was less
a matter of positive technical progress than of
an expectation of greater progress in the future.
(. . . ) It marked a break with the characteristic
medieval attitude of contemplative resignation.
(Thomas, 1971, p.1184)
What was striking, noted Thomas, is that this optimism
in the power of technical progress could not be based on
actual evidence. “It is often said that witch-beliefs are a
consequence of inadequate medical technique. But in England such beliefs declined before medical therapy had made
much of an advance” (Thomas, 1971, p.1211). In the same
way, the popularity of the work of Francis Bacon in the
17th century—that is, before the great wave of technical
progress—attests that the English were very receptive toward
optimistic ideas (Mokyr, 2016).
It is striking that similar observations can be made in the
domain of technological innovation. As Howes (2016b) observes, 18th- and 19th-century innovators had an “improving
mentality”, seeing room for improvement everywhere.
Innovators saw room for improvement, even in
wholly unfamiliar areas, and envisioned how
such improvements might be brought about. It
was not a particular skill or some special knowledge, but a frame of mind—a lens through which
they perceived the status quo as being imperfect, and then sought to rectify those imperfections. As an analogy, consider climbing: people generally see walls or mountains as barriers,
but climbers see them as objects to be scaled
and clambered over. Of otherwise ordinary industries innovators said “this could be better” –
and then did something about it. (Howes, 2016b,
p.10)
Henry Dircks, an English engineer who improved steam
engines and designed optical illusions, offered this very clear
characterization of this new mentality:
No work of art appears perfect to an enterprising mind. However simple its purpose, it may
possibly be made lighter, stronger, more efficacious, or be done away with altogether. The man
whose mind is thus constituted becomes an Inventor. (as cited in Howes, 2016a, p.8).
In the same way, innovators had limited respect for previous knowledge, and were optimistic about their own capacity
to find new solutions to old problems. For instance, Henry
Bessemer (steelmaking process) explained that he was very
aware of his ignorance, and that he thought of it as an advantage:
My knowledge of iron metallurgy was at the
time very limited... but this was in one sense
an advantage to me, for I had nothing to unlearn.
|

My mind was open and free to receive any new
impressions, without having to struggle against
the bias which a lifelong practice of routine operations cannot fail more or less to create. (as
cited in Howes, 2016a, p.10).
Technological innovators were optimistic and nonconformist: they had a new mentality.
Explaining the new attitudes toward innovation and
exploration. What might explain the decline of conformism

and the rise of optimism? An important factor may be the
unprecedented living standards experienced by English people (and more generally by Europeans) from the 17th century onward (Allen et al., 2011, Cummins, 2014, Fouquet
and Broadberry, 2015, Morris, 2013). Affluence has predictable effects on human psychology (for a recent review,
see Pepper and Nettle (2017), and can alter the dynamics of
cultural evolution (Baumard and Chevallier, 2015, Baumard
et al., 2015). In particular, recent research inspired by lifehistory theory have shown that in a harsh environment, when
the levels of available resources are low and unpredictable,
individuals tend to be more short term-oriented, more risk
averse, and more conservative. By contrast, in a resourcerich environment, individuals are future-oriented, risk-prone
and open-minded (Baumard, 2018).
This result fits well with recent finding suggesting that innovation and creativity are strongly associated with affluence
and that, on the contrary, harsh and unpredictable environments lead to informational conformism, the tendency to defer to others’ judgments (Baumard, 2018, Inglehart, 2018,
Jacquet et al., 2018, Nettle, 2018). The basic rationale for
this association between environmental harshness and informational conformism is that copying others is cheaper than
exploring by oneself, a rationale that has been widely used
to study the trade-off between exploration and exploitation
in animal foraging (Boyd and Richerson, 1988, Laland and
Williams, 1998, Rieucau and Giraldeau, 2011). When resources are abundant, individuals should be interested in cognitive investment and cognitive exploration, and thus be curious, independent and open-minded. On the contrary, when
resources are low, individuals should not waste their scarce
resources in exploring their environment, but should be conservative and conformist (Jacquet et al., 2018, Nettle, 2018).
The rising living standards experienced by Europeans may
thus have changed individuals’ psychology, from a pessimistic, conformist and conservative outlook toward a more
optimistic, non-conformist and progressive one. As a result,
Europeans would have started being more confident in their
capacity to change the world, to propose new theories and to
test them. In turn, this optimism may have made the experimental method and natural philosophy more appealing (despite the fact that, in the 17th century, there was as yet no
evidence that experiments and science could really improve
people’s situation).
Limitations of this study. Our study has revealed a strong
association between affluence and scientific productivity.
12

However, this does not demonstrate a causal link between
the two phenomena. For instance, changes in both prosperity and creative productivity could have been caused by another, hidden change in history. One candidate is institutional
change. Thus, it could be that inclusive institutions caused a
rise in both scientific productivity and affluence (Acemoglu
and Robinson, 2012, North, 1990) which would explain our
finding that scientific productivity, affluence, and inclusive
institutions are highly correlated. One problem with this explanation is that it does not explain why some countries were
lucky enough to get inclusive institutions while others only
got inefficient institutions. In fact, a growing body of works
both in political science (Abramson and Boix, 2014, Boix
and Stokes, 2003) and in the behavioral sciences (Petersen
and Aarøe, 2015, Safra et al., 2017) suggests that better life
conditions are associated with higher level of interpersonal
trust and higher support for inclusive institutions. In other
words, institutional development, political freedom and inclusiveness are endogenous, not exogeneous, and they accompany economic development (Boix and Stokes, 2003).
In any case, future work should use causal or quasi-causal
methods and find variables in datasets that are assigned in a
way that is as good as random, as in the case, for example,
of the distance from the coast in the study of the impact of
the Atlantic slave trade (Nunn and Qian, 2011), or soil composition when studying the impact of the introduction of the
heavy plow (Andersen et al., 2016).
Another limitation of this study is that it is focused on
early modern Europe, whereas scientific production has been
notable levels of other societies and earlier periods: in particular in Ancient Greece, in the Arab and Persian worlds,
and in South and East Asia. Recent works in economic history suggests that these periods in these places were also
characterized by increasing living standards (Morris, 2013,
Ober, 2015). Future work should aim to test whether the association between affluence and scientific production holds
for non-European societies, and whether increased prosperity could explain the rise of science in 4th-century Athens or
10th-century Baghdad.

Methods
Scientific and Artistic Production. To collect the datasets,

we used a top-down approach based on Wikipedia categories
(Gergaud et al., 2017). First, we manually identified all the
relevant Wikipedia categories (for instance, “18th century
Italian mathematicians”).
We only included individuals working in the “hard sciences”: mathematicians, physicists, astronomers, chemists,
biologists, botanists, and zoologists (the first three categories
account for more 90% of the sample). The rationale for
this choice is that these domains correspond to the core domains of the 17th century Scientific Revolution. It also corresponds to what economists call “useful knowledge,” the kind
of knowledge involved in the manipulation of the material
world, and the main source of growth during the Industrial
Revolution (Jacob, 1997; Mokyr, 2016). In any case, the
number of social scientists in Wikipedia before 1850 is too

Quantifying the Scientific Revolution

limited for a quantitative study. We also excluded physicians,
because their biographies are mostly concerned not with scientific advances, but with their social role at the time. Moreover, given medical doctors’ poor record at increasing medical knowledge before the late 19th century, they arguably do
not represent a good proxy for innovation (Wootton, 2007).
We also wanted to measure cultural creativity in general.
We thus included all occupations that involve an important
component of innovation and creativity: writers, philosophers, painters, musicians and sculptors. By contrast, we excluded rulers, military personnel, lawyers, religious leaders,
and physicians because these occupations arguably do not involve the same level of creativity. Some extra creative occupations could have been included, but were excluded due to
the small number of individuals in each category: engineers,
geographers, explorers, cartographers, or architects. In total,
22,943 individuals were included in the dataset (see Table 2).

and Portugal), Poland, Russia and Scandinavia (see Fig. 15).

de Courson & Baumard

Quantifying the Scientific Revolution

we referred to the Wikipedia category in which we had
found the page (e.g., someone belonging to the category
of “Italian mathematicians” was considered Italian). Second, when this was not possible, a script looked at the first
words on the page, more precisely those following the pattern “[Name] ([dates]) was a. . . ”. Therefore, a page beginning with “Galileo Galilei (15 February 1564 – 8 January
1642) was an Italian astronomer” meant that Galileo would
be classified as Italian. Finally, for the most incomplete
datasets (Renaissance scientists, Renaissance philosophers),
we added country information manually.
We collected three proxies for the importance of an individual’s contribution to the advancement of science (Gergaud
et al., 2017):
1. Length: The number of bytes in the Wikipedia page
(from “Page Information”) 2. Languages: The number of
languages in which there was a page for the individual (from
Wikidata) 3. Quotation: The number of Wikipedia pages
containing a link toward this page (from the corresponding
Wikidata item page).
None of these indexes is perfect, and they all have their
biases, so we calculated z-scores for each of them, and combined the three to create a more general index of Individual
Scientific Productivity (for scientists) or Artistic Indivividual
Productivity (for artists)(see Fig. 4).
To avoid a potential language bias leading to an overestimation of British production, we ran this study on the three
largest Wikipedias: English, French and German. Contrary
to our expectations, the datasets from the French and German Wikipedias were not always smaller than those from English Wikipedia (for instance, the German-language dataset
of scientists is much larger than the English-language dataset,
while the opposite is true for painters). Note also that previous work on notable individuals in Wikipedia has demonstrated that while a small portion of lesser-known individuals
are present in non-English pages but absent in English pages,
this is not the case for the most notable individuals (Gergaud
et al., 2017).
Next, for a given year (here noted y), we computed the Total Scientific Product. Assuming an average peak productivity at 35, we used the following formula: National Scientific
Product is the sum of the Individual Scientific Productivity of
all individuals who reached the age of 35 between the year y
-25 and the year y + 25 in a given country.
To get per capita estimates, we divided the National Scientific Product by the estimate population in year y (estimates
are taken from the Atlas of World Population (McEvedy,
Jones & others, 1978). This provided demographic estimates
for every century, or every 50 years. We thus performed a
linear extrapolation to derive population figures at ten-year
intervals for each country.
Because we were interested in the dynamics of the Scientific Revolution, which is usually dated around 1650, we
choose 1500 as the starting date of our study and 1850 as the
ending date.
Environmental variables. In order to study the ecological

determinants of scientific production, we used three mea|

13

sures of standard of living: GDP per capita (Broadberry et al.,
2017) and urbanization ratio (Bosker et al., 2013), as well as
a crude estimate of lifespan (Cummins, 2014).
To test the importance of universities, we used the number
of universities retrieved from Wikipedia’s “List of medieval
universities” and “List of oldest universities in continuous operation”.
To test the importance of inclusive institutions, we used
two measures: the number of autonomous cities per country (Stasavage, 2014) and the the number of calendar years
per century in which for the various areas a parliament (or
estates-general, cortes, corts, diet, sejm, riksdag, Generallandtag, or Reichstag) assembled for official sessions during shorter or longer periods in a year (Van Zanden et al.,
2012). This measure can vary from zero, when no parliament
was convened (or none existed), to 100, when a meeting took
place in every year of the century.
To test the effect of Protestantism, we created two groups
of countries based on their religious affiliation after the Wars
of Religion and the Treaty of Westphalia, when the borders of each religion were more and less settled. Protestant
countries include England, Scotland, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Scandinavia. Catholic countries include France, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Belgium.
To test the effect of the printing press, we compared scientific productivity before and after Gutenberg’s invention of
the printing press around 1440.
We took these environmental variables as predictors, plotted linear regressions of country-level cultural production
against each variable, and computed correlation coefficients
for production (taken as the mean of the z-scores for the 9
estimates).
