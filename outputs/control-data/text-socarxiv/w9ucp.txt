Abstract
This paper presents a critical account of the representation of immigration in the Brexit corpus—
a collective corpus of 108,452,923 words compiled mostly from blogs, tweets, and daily news
related to Brexit debate. The study follows the methodological synergy approach proposed by
Baker et al. (2008), a heuristic methodological approach that combines methods of discourse
analysis and corpus-assisted statistical tools including keyword, collocation, and concordance
analysis. Drawing on this methodological synergy approach, the investigation yields significant
findings contextualized within the socio-economic-political context of the European Union (EU)
leave referendum to trace how the issue of immigration is represented in the discourses of the
Remain and Leave campaigns. The frequency results show that immigration is one of the most
salient topics in the Brexit corpus. Concordance analysis of the word immigrants and collocation
investigation of the word immigration reveal opposing attitudes toward immigration in the EU
referendum debate. The analysis uncovers negative attitudes toward the uncontrolled flow of
immigrants from other EU countries and public concerns about immigrants' negative impacts on
wages, education, and health services. Other findings reveal positive attitudes toward immigrants
emphasizing their positive contributions to the UK economy. The study concludes with an
argument of the significant association between the political and socio-economic ideologies of a
particular society and the language communicated in its media.

Preliminaries: A Historical Account of the Brexit
The term Brexit—a blended word of Britain and exit—came into existence to refer to the UK's
official withdrawal from the EU. The EU was formed in the 1950s by European countries that
desired to build stronger ties after World War II. In 1952, Belgium, France, Italy, Luxenberg,
Netherland, and West Germany signed the Treaty of Rome, forming the European Economic
Community (EEC). In 1973, the EEC welcomed three new members, the UK, Denmark, and
Ireland. A couple of years after joining the EEC, the UK held its first national EEC in/out
referendum, and 67.2% of voters chose to stay in the EEC.
On November 1, 1993, the EEC became known as the EU, reflecting the development of
the European association from an economic union into a political union integrating 28 members
and enacting its own laws and reforms within a flourishing political and economic state. The
Schengen visa was introduced in 1995 permitting free movement among EU countries .Even so,
the UK did not open its borders entirely like other EU countries. Also, the UK chose to keep the
British pound as its official currency rather than approving the Euro (see Hobolt, 2016; Peers,
2016).
In 2009, the EU adopted Article 50 under the Lisbon Treaty, establishing an official
mechanism for any EU country leaving the EU. Around this time, many major issues started to
incite national calls for the UK to leave the EU. The EU witnessed a great economic collapse in
Greece, requiring efforts by all parties to stabilize Greece’s economy. Additionally, the EU
experienced floods of immigrants whose preferred destinations were the UK, France, and
Germany. Although personally rejecting calls to leave the EU in 2012, Prime Minister David
Cameron announced a national in/out referendum under pressure from many of the members of
Parliament and the Independence Party. On June 23, 2016, 17.4 million UK citizens voted, and
51.9% of them chose to leave the EU. Cameron resigned immediately. The value of the British
pound fell 15% lower than the United States dollar and the UK and the EU began negotiating their
divorce bill (see Hobolt, 2016; Peers, 2016).
The term Brexit was analyzed semantically by Fontaine (2017), implementing a systemic
functional linguistic approach with a corpus of 1,641,903 words. Buckledee (2018) explores the
ways the Leave campaign overcame the Remain party from a linguistic perspective. He
investigates the ways language affects the political process as voters are exploited through
persuasive and emotive linguistic strategies using influential metaphors and inspiring tones
(Buckledee, 2018). Although Brexit has been a major cause of concern in the UK and EU socioeconomic-political scenes, the field of linguistics lacks a discursive linguistic analysis of the
massive political discourse that has come into existence since the first inclusion of the term Brexit
in the Oxford English Dictionary (2012). Among the most provocative issues in the Brexit debate
is immigration. A main claim of the Leave campaign is that leaving the EU will allow the UK to
better regulate the movement of immigrants from EU countries. The aim of the present study is to
investigate the discursive patterns of the representations of immigration in the discourses of the
Leave and Remain campaigns utilizing corpus-assisted discourse analysis (CADA) tools. The
availability of the two representative sub-corpora, Opinion on Brexit–agreement and Opinion on
Brexit—disagreement, with the same amounts of words and tokens (see Appendix A) is important
for yielding reliable findings (Baker, 2011). An account of the CADA is given in the following
section along with its applications in a variety of contexts.

A Corpus-Assisted Critical Discourse Analysis Approach
The use of corpus linguistics (CL) dates back to the 1950s when compiling an electronic, readable
format of a particular language was a novel innovation used by a few linguists with great
enthusiasm. A few decades later, CL had been integrated into discourse analysis studies. Sinclair
(2004) describes CL and discourse analysis as “the twin pillars of language research. … They both
encourage the formulation of radically new hypotheses [and] the dimensions of patterns that they
deal with are, on the whole, larger than linguistics is accustomed to” (p. 11). Only a few years ago,
the combination of the qualitative methods of discourse analysis and quantitative statistical tools
in CL permitted significant developments in the field of discourse analysis. The integration of
these two disciplines resulted in the emergence of what was called corpus-assisted discourse
studies (CADS) (Partington, 2004, 2006). The integration of CL and Critical Discourse Analysis
(CDA), which views discourse as “a form of social practice” (Fairclough & Wodak, 1997, p. 258),
within this developing body of research has been come to be known as Corpus-assisted Critical
Discourse Analysis (CACDA). In a very significant study that initiated this synergy approach,
CACDA was taken up by Baker et al. (2008), who investigate the patterns of discourses on
refugees and immigrants in a data set of 140 million words in the UK press. Due to its
multidisciplinary nature, CACDA research is best considered to be a multidimensional endeavor
that can be understood only within the context of its multidisciplinary areas. The most important
area of them is CDA.
CDA has rapidly expanded in the 20th century as a theoretical framework with three main
approaches: Van Dijk’s (1996, 1997, 1998, 2001) cognitive-discourse framework, Wodak’s (2001)
historical framework, and Fairclough’s (1995) social framework. According to Wodak (2001),
CDA is primarily concerned with investigating the associations among language, power, and
ideology. Similarly, Van Dijk (1997, 1998) proposes that CDA is best used to uncover discursive
representations of inequalities, social prejudices, and discriminatory social practices and how these
discursive representations are constituted, maintained, and adapted within their social and cultural
contexts. From the perspective of methodology, McKay (2009) suggests that CDA applies tools
and methods adapted from a variety of disciplines, such as text linguistics, rhetoric,
sociolinguistics, and semantics, to uncover how language, power, and ideology are related to each
other and how these dependent relations are represented through texts.
The application of CDA has been proved to be advantageous in investigating discourse in
a diversity of contexts, including political issues (e.g., Fairclough, 2001, 2003b; Kress, 1994),
discrimination and racism representation (e.g., Van Dijk, 1996, 1998, 2000), and media (e.g.,
Fairclough,1995b). However, the adequacy of CDA as an analytical approach has often been
subjected to critical criticisms (Baker et al., 2008; Koller & Mauntner, 2004; Stubbs, 1997;
Widdowson, 2000, 2001, 2004). Among issues that have provoked debate within this body of
criticism is the subjective selection of texts to be analyzed. Koller & Mauntner (2004) state that
the danger is that the texts selected within the CDA framework attract the researcher’s attention
but are not representative of the discourse addressed. CDA researchers are accused of "cherry
picking" texts that best prove their positions (Widdowson, 2000, 2001, 2004). Another major
criticism of CDA is stated by Stubbs (1997), who criticizes CDA researchers for focusing on smallscale based studies and overlooking significant language forms and patterns occurring within
millions of running texts.

These criticisms have spurred the integration of CL tools into CADS (Baker & McEnery,
2015; Partington et al., 2004; Partington, 2008). Many advocates of CACDA argue that this
mythological synergy is more advantageous because it relies on the strengths of each approach to
compensate for the weaknesses of the other and enhances discourse research in a variety of
methodological aspects. First, CACDA relies on large-scale corpus with naturally occurring
language, decreasing the influence of the researcher’s bias (Baker, 2006). One of the key
advantages of CADS is that CL can increase the objectivity of CDA (Taylor & Marche, 2018).
Second, investigations using CACDA display data in authentic contexts, improving understanding
of the discourse investigated and more comprehensively representing the discursive patterns.
Third, CACDA relies on triangulation using the qualitative tools of CDA and the quantitative tools
of CL. It thus yields more reliable results than traditional CDA methods because the corpus
investigated is designed according to specific criteria ensuring the validity of generalizations
(McEnery & Wilson, 2001). Accordingly, Marchi & Taylor (2009) explain that the methodological
attributes of both CDA and CL are combined within the newly developed framework of CACDA.
In Marchi & Taylor’s (2009) words, CL is a quantitative approach grounded in a data-driven
framework based on large samples with statistical significance, and descriptive analysis with great
objectivity, leading to generalizable and reliable results. In contrast, CDA is a qualitative approach
grounded in a theory-driven framework relying on individual, selected samples with social
significance, and explanatory investigation that is often subjective.
The CAD field has grown rapidly, stimulating a beneficial combination of CL and
discourse analysis. Following Baker et al. (2008), a growing body of CACDA research has
emerged. Most of this research has targeted political conflicts, immigrants, and the marginalization
of some minorities. The main data source in this growing body of research is the press and social
media, because the media is the tool political and social authorities use to impose their laws and
acts within social communities (Van Dijk, 1996). Kandil (2009) used keyword analysis,
collocation, and concordance to investigate media representations of the conflict between Israel
and Palestine. Salama (2011) relied on collocation in a CDA analysis of the ideological
representations of Wahabi and anti-Wahabi campaigns in a corpus of two books after the 9/11
attacks. Su & Xiao (2015) investigated discursive representation of the Chinese dream among both
officials and citizens based on a corpus of tokens compiled from the Chinese press. Similarly,
Haider (2016) utilized the tools of keyword extraction, collocation and concordance in his
investigation of representations of the Qaddafi regime in a corpus of 27 million words in the press
before, during, and after the Libyan uprising periods.
The present study adopts the CACDA to investigate the discursive patterns of
representations of immigration in the Brexit debate by both the Remain and Leave campaigns—
an area that is not yet investigated. This paper is aimed at improving understanding of the
representations of immigration issues in both positive- and negative- sentimentally classified subcorpora. The present investigation also explores in what ways these representations are related to
the socio-economic-political context through a qualitative concordance investigation grounded in
CDA.

Research Questions
The present study aimed at addressing the following questions:
RQ (1): What are the most significant topics communicated in the (a) Brexit corpus as a whole,
(b) Brexit—agreement corpus, and (c) Brexit—disagreement corpus?
RQ (2): What does concordance analysis of the word “immigrants” in the Brexit corpus reveal?
RQ (3): What does the word immigration collocate with? How do these collocations relate to the
socio-economic-political context?
Methodological Framework
Methodology
The methodological framework applied in this study is based on the premises underlying the use
of CL in discourse-related studies. According to Partington (2003), CL is used in CAD in a number
of ways. Most simply, CL provides the analysts with instances of the phenomenon under
investigation. At the other extreme, CL assists the analysts in reinforcing, refuting, or revising their
initial assumptions. Baker et al. (2008) explain that CL helps the discourse analyst to “quantify
discoursal phenomena already recognized in CDA” (p. 285). This study’s methodology follows
the methodological steps used by scholars conducting CAD in this field (Baker et al., 2008; HardtMautner, 2009; Partington, 2003).
The first stage was “setting the scene” of the analysis (Baker et al., 2008, p. 284; HardtMautner, 2009). A preliminary investigation of the corpus to formulate research questions
involved extensive readings about the Brexit issue in the British press. Background investigation
and formulation of the research questions were performed before the CAD analysis. The second
stage was choosing and compiling the appropriate corpus to fulfill the study aim. The two
representative sub-corpora, Opinion on Brexit—agreement and Opinion on Brexit—disagreement
are important to yield significant results. The third stage was to select appropriate CL tools. The
Brexit corpus selected was available at the Sketch Engine and could be analyzed via all the Sketch
Engine CL tools. The fourth stage was detecting the emerging lexical patterns through frequency
and keyword extractions and generating collocations grouped by semantic categorizations. This
stage was crucial in identifying the most common themes and topics communicated in the corpus.
The fifth stage was a qualitative investigation of these common themes and topics through
concordance analysis. The final stage consisted of revising the research questions and drawing
implications. (see Baker et al., 2008, p. 295, for an outline of these stages).
Data
The data investigated in this study came from the Brexit Corpus compiled as part of the EU-funded
research project, a joint effort by the University of Trento, Websays.com, and Aix-Marseille
University (see http://www.sense-eu.info/). The Brexit corpus consists of 108,452,923 words and
125,637,141 tokens compiled from 285,360 links and 506,808 documents mostly from blogs,
tweets, and daily news related to Brexit topics. The corpus was compiled, classified, and annotated
to enable searching by a specific sentiment (negative, neutral, or positive), topic (e.g., Leave and
Leave AGAINST EU, Remain and Remain for EU, Immigration, Brussels), or opinion (agreement
or disagreement). Appendix A displays the sub-corpora statistics for the Brexit corpus.

Results
Keyword Analysis
Keyness is illustrated by Baker et al. (2008) as “the statistically significant higher frequency of
particular words or clusters in the corpus under analysis in comparison with another corpus” (p.
278). These words with significantly higher frequency guide the investigation by indicating the
“aboutness” of the main corpus and the two sub-corpora (Scott, 1999). Considering the research
questions of this study, the words with higher frequency indicate the most common themes
represented in the corpus. The keyword analysis not only indicates the focus or aboutness of the
corpus but also suggests the focus of further investigations based on with what the most common
themes in the corpus collocate. The first 100 keywords were generated from each corpus using the
English Web 2013 (enTenTen13) as the reference corpus. These keywords generated from these
three corpora (Brexit Corpus, Opinion on Brexit–agreement and Opinion on Brexit—
disagreement) are shown in Appendix B,C and D.
The keyword analysis shows two important things. First, the three corpora have great
similarity in terms of their keywords, or the most significant themes/topics they discuss. Second,
the Brexit—agreement corpus and the Brexit—disagreement corpus have great similarity in the
lexical frequency of their keywords. The most frequent word in the three corpuses is Brexit, which
occurred 352,529 times in the whole corpus 142,879 times in the Brexit—agreement corpus and
131,254 times in Brexit—disagreement corpus. The same was true with the other words, such as
Corbyn (referring to Jeremy Corbyn, a leader of the Labour Party) Remain, VoteLeave, EUref,
VoteRemain, worryingly, marginally, job-destroying, unionists, and rightwing.
Following Baker (2010), the generated keywords were grouped into semantic categories
based on their semantic meaning. Preliminary readings of the historical and socio-political
backgrounds helped mapping the generated keyword lists in the semantic categorization, as shown
in table 1.

revealed are related to the influence of Brexit on the UK and the rest of EU. Among these
significant topics is that of immigration. Relating the frequency analysis results to socio-economic
background, the Leave campaign emphasizes that Brexit will enable the UK to decrease the flow
of immigration and have more control over the movement of immigrants from other European
countries. A crucial argument by the Leave campaign is that the more immigrants move to Britain,
the more concerns they raise about job competitiveness, salaries, and overall quality of life. The
counterargument is that immigrants increase consumption of services, leading to more job
opportunities. In addition, a number of the immigrants are young and well educated and
complement UK citizens’ skills and professions.
The concordance analysis of the Opinion on Brexit—agreement sub-corpus and the Opinion
on Brexit—disagreement sub-corpus yields significant results indicating opposing views on
immigration. This analysis involves searching for the word immigrants in both sub-corpora and
identifying the sentiment classification (positive or negative) of its usage. The word immigrants
occurs 8,358 times (66.50 times per 1 million) in the Opinion on Brexit—agreement corpus. Its
concordance analysis is illustrated in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Concordance analysis of the word immigrants in the Opinion on Brexit—
agreement corpus.
The concordance analysis clearly reveals that the Leave campaign has concerns about the
impacts on quality of life that are resulted from the increasing number of immigrants. Examples
are:

The word immigrants occur 7,274 (57.90 times per 1 million) in the Opinion on Brexit—
disagreement corpus. Its concordance analysis is illustrated in Figure 2.

The concordance analysis clearly reveals that the Remain campaign is concerned about skilled
immigrants’ contributions to economic development that complement the UK nationals. The
Remain campaign also emphasizes the cultural impact the diversity of communities can have.

Others from the Remain campaign are concerned with the difficulties and suffering poor
immigrants might face. The word Mediterranean is found to be among the most-frequent words
in the corpus. The following extract using the word Mediterranean is a call to draw public attention
to the hundreds of immigrants who have died trying to cross the Mediterranean.

Collocation Analysis
Collocation analysis reveals the salient themes associated with the topic investigated (Baker, 2006;
Baker et al., 2013). Collocation has always been associated with discourse prosody because it
detects attitudes based on the association between words’ meanings (Baker, 2006). In collocational
analysis, an item is classified as positive, negative, or neutral prosody when it is frequently cooccurs with positive, negative, or neutral collocates.
A collocation analysis of the word immigration was conducted within the span (-5 to +5)
of the whole Brexit corpus. The aim was to reveal the discursive patterns associated with the topics
of immigration and Brexit. The analysis yields the top 24 collocates of these categories: modifiers
of immigration, nouns and verbs modified by immigration, and verbs with immigration as their
object. Figure 3 illustrates this collocation analysis. Each collocate generated has an indication of
its lexical frequency score in the corpus calculated by the logDice formula. It is also accompanied

The verb control is also found to collocate frequently with immigration as an object. Other
verbs that collocate strongly with immigration and express negative attitudes toward uncontrolled
immigration to UK are stop, reduce, cut, limit, and manage in both sentiment and positive
instances, that is, in the debate of both the Leave and Remain campaigns. Examples in contexts
are given below.

Some of the top collocate verbs with the word immigration as an object—increase, affect,
and overwhelm—reveal the same attitude toward immigration. However, other collocates, such
as enrich, emphasize the positive impacts of immigration and immigrants’ contributions to the
UK’s economic development. Below is an extract as an example.

Conclusion
This study makes a response to a noticeable lack of uncovering the discursive patterns associated
with the issue of immigration in the Brexit context. Following Baker et al. (2008), the CL and
CDA approaches have complemented each other throughout the study by triangulating them in all
aspects of the investigation. Within this framework, CL tools have been utilized to establish a
pattern map of the corpus studied based on statistically significant results for keywords,
collocations, and concordances. Meanwhile, CDA not only directed the analyst’s attention to
significant patterns examined with CL tools but also related the investigation to the socioeconomic-political contexts. The investigation has been carried out carried out in accordance with
the main assumption underlying CDA that discourse is a social practice (Fairclough, 1995a). The
quantitative investigation follows the three phases proposed by Fairclough (1995a): describing,
interpreting, and explaining. The analysis confirmed the observations made by Baker et al. (2008)
about the fuzzy boundaries between the CL quantitative approach and the CDA qualitative

approach. Overall, the triangulated analysis utilizing CL and CDA tools has uncovered opposing
views in EU in/out referendum corpus on the issue of immigration.
The keyword analysis reveals that immigration is one of the most-debated topics in the
Brexit corpus. Words such as job-destroying, enfranchisement, havens, Mediterranean, and
transatlantic are found among the top keywords. However, qualitative investigation is needed to
uncover the discursive patterns associated with these words and the ideologies underlying their
occurrences. Close observation of the concordance lines in which these words occur indicates that
immigration is related in many ways to the other significant topics communicated by the main
corpus and the sub-corpora, particularly finance, uncertainty, and international relations.
Immigration, in some instances, is found to be related to the public fear that the UK is losing
control over floods of immigrants, who negatively affect wages, education, and health services. In
other instances, remarkable accounts point out that immigrants contribute positively to a growing
and more productive economy. Immigrants not only take jobs but also create new jobs by
establishing their own business and spending their money within the UK community. Empirical
results show that EU immigrants, on one hand, take jobs and affect wages and education and health
services but, on the other hand, give UK businesses access to professional, skilled, young
employees who offer high-value added to businesses and public finance. A frequent remark made,
even in the Opinion on Brexit—agreement corpus, is that the EU leave decision should be defined
separately from the immigration issue.
The present study confirmed the relationship between language and media described by
pioneering CDA scholars, such as Herman and Chomsky (1988) and Fairclough (1995).
Fairclough (1995) emphasizes the importance of the relationship between the political and socioeconomic backgrounds of a society and the language communicated in its media. This
investigation of the Brexit corpus supports this argument that the media in any society reflects the
ideologies of the political and social elites. This study also contributes to the work of research on
language, media, and society demonstrating how the linguistic patterns in the media of a society
are affected by their particular socio-economic-political contexts. CACDA facilitates both access
to and investigation of the language of media. The Brexit corpus provides a large and authentic
corpus of media language that, when analyzed with CL tools, quantifies the ideologies and views
indicated in diverse media channels. Future studies might benefit from CACDA to undercover the
relationships among language, media, and ideologies in under-researched political and social
topics such as the Brexit and financial issues, uncertainty and UK international relations with EU.
