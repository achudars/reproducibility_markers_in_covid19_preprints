"9" "Abstract"
"10" "Education is influenced by a broad range of factors  but  there has been limited research into the role that school enjoyment, particularly at the start of schooling, plays in  pupil’s  education al   achievement .  In this study we used data from a UK cohort to answer three related research questions. Is school enjoyment patterned by  gender,  socioeconomic background of cognitive ability? How well does school enjoyment explain later educational  achievement ?  Does  early  school enjoyment  at age 6  associate with  social or gender differences in  later  education al  achievement  at age 16 ?   Our results  show that school enjoyment measured at age 6  is  associate d  with  gender and cognitive ability but not  family socioeconomic background .  For example, g irls  were  twice as  likely to report enjoying school than boys  ( OR: 1.97; 95% CI: 1.56, 2.48 ) .  S chool enjoyment  strongly associated with  later  achievement   even after adjustment for  socioeconomic background  and  cognitive ability ;   pupils who reported enjoying school scored on average  14.4  (95% CI:  6.9, 21.9 )  more points, equivalent to  a lmost  a   3 -grade  increase across all GCSE’s , and were  29 % more likely to obtain 5+ A*-Cs including Maths and English (OR: 1. 29 ; 95% CI:  0.99 ,  1.7 )  than those who did not enjoy school.   These results highlight the importance of school enjoyment for educational  achievement . As a  potentially  more modifiable factor than socioeconomic background, cognitive ability  or  gender, school enjoyment  may  represent a promising intervention target for  improving  educational  outcomes .  Whether these relationships are causal should be tested via experimental studies."
"11" "Introduction"
"12" "Educational  achievement  is influenced by  a vast array of factors including cognitive ability   (Deary et al., 2007) ; teacher ability   (Chetty et al., 2014a, 2014b) ; school quality   (Rasbash et al., 2010; Slater et al., 2012) ;  parental academic support  (Phillips et al., 1998) ; family  socioeconomic background  (Bynner and Joshi, 2002; Morris et al., 2016) ;  and  peer s   (Wentzel and Caldwell, 1997) . One area  on which there is relatively little evidence  is  school enjoyment , despite its ‘common sense’ link to  achievement  (Smith et al., 2016) .   I t has been  acknowledge d  that enjoyment of learning is a key aim for educators and policymakers  to improv e  pupils ’  educational experience and outcomes   (Gorard and See, 2011) , and s chool enjoyment  is, at least intuitively,   far  more easily modifiable than other factors such as family socioeconomic position  (Smith et al., 2016) . School enjoyment  may therefore offer a promising target for interventions to increase educational  achievement ."
"13" "Prior research has demonstrated that children who enjoy school are  much  more likely to  outperform those who  dislike school   (Larson et al., 1985; Lüftenegger et al., 2016; Tze et al., 2016) .  In a study of 90 Chicago high school students ’  performance in a research project, enjoyment of the project was the second strongest predictor of final grade (behind high school grade point average) and accounted for almost half a grade difference  (Larson et al., 1985) . In a study of 388 psychology university students in Austria, exam enjoyment was associated with a one - sixth   increase in final grade  where grades were scaled from one to five  (Lüftenegger et al., 2016) .  A m eta-analysis of academic boredom and academic outcomes  (motivation, learning strategies and achievement)  revealed an overall correlation of -0.24   (Tze et al., 2016) .  Studies have also observed an association between  e njoyment of specific school subjects such as Maths and reading  and  higher subject performance  (Chiu and McBride-Chang, 2006; Prendergast and O’Donoghue, 2014; Smith et al., 2012) .  In an analysis of the Longitudinal Survey of Young People in England (LSYPE),  Vignoles and Meschi  (2010)  find that amongst a sample of approximately 11,000 children, school enjoyment at age 14 associates strongly with achievement at age 16. Sylva et al  (2012)  observe positive associations between school enjoyment at age 11 and achievement at age 14 that are stronger for Mathematics than English.  T he inconsistent measurement of enjoyment  hinders the comparability of  these results , but the overall trend of  findings   suggests that enjoyment of the learning environment is  strongly and  positively associated with  achievement .  However, there is some inconsistency in study findings. Two studies investigating school enjoyment during primary school years found no strong evidence that school enjoyment associated with contemporaneous achievement  (Gutman and Feinstein, 2008; Sylva et al., 2012) , but long run associations with later achievement were not analysed."
"14" "School enjoyment has been hypothesised to result in higher academic inspiration and motivation to learn  (Smith et al., 2016) , which in turn leads to higher educational  achievement  (Vecchione et al., 2014) . However,  much of the literature focuses on school enjoyment in mid and late childhood.  C hildren who perceive themselves as  having  low ability are less likely to enjoy school or education activities  (Miserandino, 1996; Pekrun et al., 2009)  and school enjoyment at later ages may therefore in part reflect earlier achievement  (Vignoles and Meschi, 2010) . Using measures of school enjoyment assessed at ages 7 and 10, Gutman & Vorhaus  (2012)  demonstrate strong association s  between school enjoyment and engagement, which they argue as “indicating that children who enjoy school are more likely to be motivated and engaged in their school work at a later point in time”  (Gutman and Vorhaus, 2012, p. 7) . School enjoyment  later in childhood  could therefore  reflect feedback effects of reward systems from achievement earlier in childhood and  arise from a reaction to external reward factors that high ability pupils experience rather than  reflecting  intrinsic motivations  (Ryan and Deci, 2000) . From the  bestowing  of  awards , through to being allocated to high ability sets, there are numerous ways in which the behaviour of children who act in certain ways is rewarded at schools in a manner  that might lead some to feel greater satisfaction. Conversely, the awarding of punishments such as detention for some behaviours through to subtle but public chastisement of a child by a teacher in a classroom are examples of how children who do worse at school can be made to feel worse too.  Earlier measures of school enjoyment that are more robust to such feedback effects may provide stronger evidence about the long run effects of school enjoyment on achievement and better indication of the potential for early interventions. Furthermore, earlier measures of school enjoyment are also appealing as they offer the longest period of potential intervention before later education and testing outcomes and could therefore offer the most promising point for interventions."
"15" "Gutman & Vorhaus  (2012)  provide an overview of the ways in which dimensions of children’s wellbeing (emotional, behavioural, social and school factors) associate with their educational achievement. They highlight that many previous studies have combined school enjoyment with other measures of school wellbeing or as an input to constructs of positive emotions  (c.f. Lüftenegger et al., 2016; Pekrun et al., 2009)  that prohibits disentangling the unique effects of children’s school enjoyment on their outcomes.  P revious research has   found that school support is positively associated with school enjoyment while mental health-related needs are negatively associated  (Smith et al., 2016) .  Furthermore,  few  studies  have appropriately controlled for parental or family factors as potential confounders. This reflects a general lack of understanding of the family level drivers of school enjoyment.  It has been highlighted how many previous studies have failed to appropriately account for background family factors due to limitations of administrative data  (Vignoles and Meschi, 2010) , so the extent to which a pupils school enjoyment reflects their family social background is unknown.  Friendship groups, relationships with teachers, classroom activities, teachers attitude to lessons and school facilities are also important determinants of school enjoyment  (Ainley and Ainley, 2011; Gorard and See, 2011) , and each of these are linked in complex ways to family background characteristics through the social structures surrounding UK education.  It has been observed that a pupil’s school enjoyment is unrelated to the school that they attend  (Gibbons and Silva, 2011; Vignoles and Meschi, 2010) . School enjoyment therefore may be considered to reflect something inherent to a child or their upbringing rather than due to extraneous school contextual factors."
"16" "On average ,   girls have  been estimated to have  higher levels of s chool  enjoyment than boys  (Siann et al., 1996)  which decrease more rapidly from primary to secondary school  (Chamberlain et al., 2010; Gutman et al., 2009) .  However, this may not hold true across all aspects of schooling  and there will be  considerable  variability between individual children . For example,  one study found evidence that boys were more likely to enjoy  maths  lessons than girls   (Prendergast and O’Donoghue, 2014) . There is  also  some   evidence that school  enjoyment  may  mediate gender differences in  achievement  (Chiu and McBride-Chang, 2006) , raising the possibility that enjoyment  play s  a role in the formation of gender inequalities in education .   As with other drivers of educational  achievement , difficulties arise in isolating the contribution that school enjoyment makes independent of other factors. The  substantial  socioeconomic inequalities that pervade education in the UK  could  confound associations  (Feinstein, 2003; Jerrim and Vignoles, 2013; Morris et al., 2016; Strand, 2011) ."
"17" "Whether the association  of  school enjoyment  and achievement  is  confound ed by  factors such as family socioeconomic position  has  important implications for  teachers and policy makers .  For example, a  child’s  enjoyment  of school  may  partly  reflect parental involvement or interest in  their  education , which is  itself highly socially patterned   (Flouri, 2006) .  P revious studies have focussed on enjoyment  at the time of examination  (Larson et al., 1985; Lüftenegger et al., 2016; Tze et al., 2016) , but enjoyment may vary considerably throughout a child ’ s schooling ,  from initial enrolment through to final examinations .  Strong  longitudinal  associations between  school enjoyment  in early childhood  and  later  achievement  may offer promise for early intervention  possibilities  before educational inequalities can  widen   with age  (Feinstein, 2003; Jerrim and Vignoles, 2013; Morris et al., 2016) ."
"18" "Thus, there is limited longitudinal evidence about the relationship between  school enjoyment and academic achievement.  Here, we provide new evidence about the following hypotheses.  1) What is the long run association between early school enjoyment and later academic achievement? 2) To what extent do family background factors underlie this association? 3) Do gender differences in school enjoyment underlie gender differences in achievement?  In this  paper , we use data from a UK cohort study , the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC),  to   provide new evidence about these hypotheses by  investigat ing   the association between school enjoyment  at age six  and educational  achievement  in nationally standardized tests  at age 16 . We first assess the  socioeconomic  patterning of  self-reported school enjoyment during early childhood  to determine if  this could confound  enjoyment- achievement  associations . We then test  the association between  early  school enjoyment and educational  achievement  at age 16  controlling for a range of  potential  confounding factors including  parental education, socioeconomic position  and  cognitive ability   to investigate if these  explain  associations  between  school enjoyment  and  achievement .  Finally, we test whether gender differences in enjoyment help to explain the gender gap  in educational  achievement ."
"19" "Methods"
"20" "Study sample"
"21" "Participants were children from ALSPAC. Pregnant women resident in Avon, UK with expected dates of delivery 1st April 1991 to 31 st  December 1992 were invited to take part in the study. The initial number of pregnancies enrolled was 14,541. When the oldest children were approximately 7 years of age, the study was expanded to include eligible cases who had failed to join the study originally. This additional recruitment gave a total sample of 15,247 pregnancies and resulted in 14,899 children who were alive at one year of age. For full details of the cohort profile and study design see  Boyd et al   (2013)  and Fraser et al  (2013) .  T he study website contains details of all the data that is available through a fully searchable data dictionary and variable search tool at  http://www.bristol.ac.uk/alspac/researchers/our-data/ . The ALSPAC cohort is largely representative of the UK population when compared with 1991 Census data; there is under representation of some ethnic minorities, single parent families, and those living in rented accommodation   (Boyd et al., 2013) . Ethical approval for the study was obtained from the ALSPAC Ethics and Law Committee and the Local Research Ethics Committees.  From the core sample of  14,899  children  alive at one year ,  3, 372  had full data .   See Figure S1 in the  supplementary  material for a STROBE diagram detailing the  causes of  attrition."
"22" "Educational  achievement"
"23" "Our measure of educational  achievement  was  fine graded point scores  from  age 16  examinations . The age 16 examinations represented the end of compulsory schooling  at  the  time the  ALSPAC cohort  were in school .  Fine graded p oint scores were used to obtain  the  riche st  measure of a child’s  formal  achievement  currently  available;   there is  greater variability  than  in  level bandings  or binary classifications such as achieving 5 A*-C GCSE’s (the required standard for  many   further education al  and occupation al opportunities ) .  Scores were obtained through data linkage to the UK National Pupil Database, which represents the most accurate record of individual educational  achievement  available in the UK.  The database still does not cover all children in the UK: s ome private schools do not submit data to the NPD , and  children who have been exclusively home schooled  will also not have records ."
"24" "School enjoyment"
"25" "At age  6 years  (mean age 6.2 years, interquartile range 6.1 to 6.2)  the  ALSPAC   participants  were asked if they like school, with the response options of  yes   and   no . Some children responded both yes and no, and these were set to missing.  At age  6.5  years (mean 6.5 years, IQR 6.5 to 6.6)  they were asked how much the y  liked going to school, with the response options  I like it a lot ,  I like it a bit , and  I don’t like it .  Responses  I like it a lot  and  I like it a bit  were coded together to maintain consistency with the binary  response  at age  6 years .  Our final school enjoyment variable  was a  three-category  combination  of these two responses,  denoting (i) children who  did not enjoy school at both occasions , (ii) children who enjoyed school at only one occasion, and (iii) children who enjoy ed  school at both occasions.   In the complete case analyses  children with a missing value on either  school enjoyment  measure were excluded."
"26" "Covariates"
"27" "Our analysis adjusted for a range of covariates including sex; month of birth;  ethnicity;  cohort  school year;  age at enjoyment questionnaire completion;  cognitive ability at age 8 ;   highest  maternal education  and  parental  social class .  The ALSPAC cohort is split over three school years ,  so we use a  three-category  variable  to indicate year and account for any temporal differences  between the  school year  cohorts .  Ethnicity was  derived from mother reports and  coded   as white  or  non-white , to reflect  the ethnic homogeneity of the cohort.  Highest maternal education  was recorded at  pregnancy  as  certificate of secondary education (CSE) ; v ocational ;  O-level ; A-level;  or  Degree. CSE and vocational were combined due to low numbers.  Parental socioeconomic position was measured using Social Class based on Occupation, consisting of the following categories: I ( p rofessional occupations); II ( m anagerial and technical occupations);  III- Non-Manual  (non-manual skilled occupations); III-Manual (manual skilled occupations);  IV (Partly skilled occupations); and V (Unskilled occupations).  To avoid low numbers ,  categories I and II were combined, and categories IV and V were combined  to give a  four-category  variable .  Armed forces personnel were set to missing  due to the inability to distinguish  seniority .  Cognitive ability  was measured  at age 8  using the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC)   (Wechsler, 1992) . The WISC was administered by members of the ALSPAC psychology team and overseen by an expert in psychometric testing, and at the time of the clinic was the most widely used individual ability test worldwide.  A short form of the measure was  used  whereby alternate items were used for all subsets, except for the coding subtest which was administered in its full form.  Raw scores were recalculated to be comparable to those that would have been obtained had the full test been administered then age-scaled to give total scores for the performance and verbal scales, and a total overall score.  Short form tests have high reliability and are widely used  (Crawford et al., 2010) .  We return to the potential implications of using  variables  measured after school enjoyment in the discussion.  We use report s   by the mothers  regarding  how  much their child ren  like their teacher s  at age 6 ,  based on a  four-point  Likert scale .  C hild temperament  is measured using a score  built from seven self-report responses to questions  relating to different aspects of the child’s temperament  at age 6  such as how happy  they are and how frequently they are angry .  Children’s  confidence in their work quality and  intelligence  were measured  from self-reports  at age 8 . Confidence in work quality was measured from four  responses  on how interesting they found their  schoolwork ,  their opinion of the quality of their work, how well they compete the work, and  their perception of their  teacher’s  opinion of their work . C onfidence in their intelligence  measured from three responses to how hard or easy they found their work and how clever they believed themselves to be .  We use a  measure of the  family  home learning  environment   combined from parent  responses to six questions   about  the learning environment  that  they provide for their child at age 3  (Crawford et al., 2011) .  These questions respond to the frequency that they teach the ir  child  colours,  the  alphabet, numbers, nursery rhymes, songs, and shapes and sizes   (Crawford et al., 2011) .  Finally, we use d  a  measure of  the quality of a  child’s friendship  group based upon five self-report responses on how happy the child is with their number of friends, whether they often see their friends outside of school,  whether their friends understand them, whether they talk to their friends about their problems, and how happy they are with their friends overall."
"28" "Multiple imputation"
"29" "Given  differential patterns of missingness amongst variables and longitudinal cohort  attrition leading to restricted numbers for  complete case  analysis  after listwise deletion,  w e conducted  Multiple Imputation by Chained Equations (MICE)   (Royston and White, 2011)  to impute missing data .  We imputed  data on all variables except for sex ,  month of birth  and ethnicity , resulting in an imputed sample size of  12, 135 .  From the se   12,135  children ,  only  2,544  (20.96%)  had full data on outcomes, exposures, and all covariates (Supplementary Figure S1).  However,  82 % had a measure of achievement  and   63 % had a measure of school enjoyment.  Item missingness increased in a broadly linear manner (Supplementary Figure S2).  While the proportion of missing data are large  for some variables ,  previous work  has demonstrated  that this will not  bias imputation results   (Madley-Dowd et al., 2019) .  Indeed,   the proportion of missing data in the complete-case sample should not be used to provide a guide on the comparative accuracy of analyses on multiply imputed or complete case data   (Madley-Dowd et al., 2019) .  Multiple imputation assumes that the values are missing at random, conditional upon the data included in the imputation model. If this assumption is violated, then results may be biased.  To  help overcome this problem and to  increase the accuracy and reliability of the multiply imputed data ,  we make use of  additional auxiliary variables   in the imputation model  as indicated in Supplementary Table S 1 .   The use of auxiliary variables increases the ability of multiple imputation models to  account for underlying patterns in missingness that would be ignored and therefore bias the complete-case analysis   (Hughes et al., 2019; Madley-Dowd et al., 2019) .   Given that the chances  that a participant   is  a complete case in our dataset is likely to remain correlated to our outcome variable even after consideration of all covariates, it is  expected  that  a  complete case  sample is a highly selected subsample and estimates based can be more  biased  than  a  multiple imputation analysis  (Hughes et al., 2019) .  Hughes et al  demonstrate that in almost all scenarios multiple imputation outperforms complete case analysis   in terms of robustness to bias ,  particularly  where there  exist s  patterns of differential  attrition and non-response  (Hughes et al., 2019) .  Unlike complete case analysis, multiple imputation  can  recover  participants and observation values that  would otherwise be excluded . Where missingness is  patterned  with respect to  particular participants or observation values  (such as those from lower socioeconomic position households   (Boyd et al., 2013) ) ,  multiple imputation will provide results   that are more balanced and generalisable to the wider cohort  than complete case analys i s .  100 datasets  were imputed for the analyses .  The supplementary material contains further details on  the imputation process ."
"30" "Statistical analysis"
"31" "W e  estimated  the  odds of mixed enjoyment or enjoying school compared to not enjoying school  using multinomial logistic regression .  We estimated  the association  of  school enjoyment and educational  achievement  using  linear regression  for  fine graded GCSE point scores and logistic regression  for  obtaining  5+ A*-C GCSE’s. T hree sets of models  are used for each modelling approach ;   t he first is an unadjusted analysis controlling only  for sex of child, month of birth , ethnicity,   cohort school  year  and age at enjoyment questionnaire completion ; the second additionally controls for parental  occupational social class  and  mother’s  highest education; the third additionally controls for the child’s  cognitive ability .  We present results  here  for the multiple imputed datasets ; results from the complete case analyses are presented in the supplementary material."
"32" "Results"
"33" "Descriptive statistics"
"34" "Table 1 displays the descriptive statistics of  the analytical sample before and after multiple imputation .  Compared to the sample of  2,544   participants  with full data,  the descriptive statistics of the imputed sample were highly similar. 7 8 %  of the imputed sample  enjoy ed  school at both occasions,  16 %  enjoy ed  school at one occasion, and  6.3 %  did not  enjoy school at both occasions.  Compared to the multiple imputed dataset, t he complete case dataset resulted in underrepresentation of  non-white participants,  families with parents in  more routine  and manual  occupation s , families with less educated mothers, and  children who scored lower on cognitive ability tests  from the  wider ALSPAC  cohort ."
"35" "< Table 1 here >"
"36" "Is school enjoyment socially  or demographically  patterned?"
"37" "There  was  no  clear social patterning of  school enjoyment by either  measure of  family  socioeconomic position  ( Table  2 ) . Children with parents  in more skilled occupations were as likely to report enjoying school as those with parents in less skilled and routine occupations.  Children with  higher educated mothers were  generally as  likely to report enjoying school as those with less educated mothers ,   though  children  with  degree - educated mothers   were more likely to  report  enjoy ing  school  at both occasions  ( Odds ratio: 1. 36 ;  95%  CI :  0.9 9 ,   1.87 ) .   Children with a one standard deviation higher measured  cognitive ability   were  also  more likely to say they  enjoy ed  school than  did  not  enjoy school  (OR: 1. 24 ; 95% CI: 1. 11 ,  1.38) .  After adjustment for all covariates,  there remained  evidence of an  association between cognitive ability and school enjoyment (OR: 1.16 ; 95% CI: 1.02, 1.32 ) .  There was little evidence of two -way interactions between each of social class, maternal education and  cognitive ability .   G irls  were  twice as  likely to say they enjoyed school than  boys  (OR :  1.97 ;  95% CI:  1.56, 2.48 ).   N on-white children  were  almost twice as  likely to  report  enjoy ing  school than white children  (OR :  1. 87 ;  95% CI: 0.9 9 ,  3. 55 ) .  There was no strong evidence that c hildren born later in the school year were less likely to enjoy school  than those born earlier in the year  (OR: 0. 98 ; 95%   CI: 0. 94 ,   1.01 ) .  There  were large and robust associations between  a child’s opinion of their teacher and their school enjoyment ; children who reported the strongest relationships with their teachers were over 9 times as likely to report enjoying school than those who  did not like their teacher (OR: 9.44; 95% CI:  4.45, 20.02 ) . Children who  reported more positive and friendly temperaments were also more likely to report enjoying school than children who reported  more negative or  angry  temperament (OR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.12, 1.26) , and children who reported higher confidence in the quality of their work were more likely to report enjoying school (OR: 1.36; 95% CI:  1.27, 1.45 ) .  Associations   were consistent across  the  imputed and complete case datasets ,  though there was far less precision in the complete case analyses  (Supplementary Table s  S 2  & S 3 )."

"39" "School enjoyment and educational  achievement"
"40" "Table 3   displays the  association  of  school enjoyment and  (later)  GCSE  achievement  (see Supplementary Table  S4  for  full parameter  estimates) .  Children  who  enjoyed  school   scored  on average  29.34   ( 95% CI:  19.4, 39.29 )  more  points at GCSE   and  those had mixed enjoyment  score d   on average  12.53   ( - 2.42, 22.65 )  more  points  compared to children who did not enjoy school .  Based on the calculation of  6  points per GCSE grade, t hese differences are  equivalent to   five  and  two  grade  difference s  in GCSE’s respectively .   Controlling for  family socioeconomic position  and  performance on cognitive ability   tests  attenuated  the se   associations  to  17.75  ( 10.45, 25.05 )   and  8.05  ( - 0.22, 15.89 )  respectively .  Further more,   controlling for   all other covariates   attenuated associations to  14.41  ( 6.9,  21.93 )  and  6.16  ( -1.7, 14.02 )  point  differences ;  broadly  equivalent to  differences of  two  and  one  grades .  I n  the  fully adjusted model ,  the association between enjoying school at age 6 and educational  achievement  at age 16 was  almost as  large  as  that for  sex (β :  21.61 ;  95% CI:  18.73, 24.48 )  and  the largest  social class  difference  (β :   22.19 ;  95% CI:  17.49, 26.89 ) .   M aternal education had  a  much  greater  effect size on GCSE point scores than  other variables , whereby children with degree educated mothers scored  on average  4 3.84  ( 38.37, 49.31 ) points  above  children whose mothers had  no qualifications, CSE or  a vocational qualification .   M easured  cognitive ability   was also strongly associated with GCSE score  (β :  43.01 ;  95% CI:  41.25, 44.77 ) , though care must be taken when interpreting this parameter as it was measured after school enjoyment .   The results were  generally  consistent across the imputed and the complete case datasets (Supplementary Table s   S4  & S 5 ), though the complete case analyses  overestimated associations between school enjoyment and achievement, and  underestimated  association s  between  both social background and  cognitive ability   with  achievement  relative to the estimates from the imputed analysis ."
"41" "Results were similar in logistic regression analyses  o f   ob taining 5 +  A*-C GCSE’s including English and Maths ( Table  4  & Supplementary Table  S6 for  full   parameter  estimates ).   C hildren who  enjoyed  school  were  6 4 % more likely to  obtain 5+ A*-Cs than  children who  did not  enjoy school ( OR:  1.6 4 ; 95% CI: 1. 3 3 ,  2. 0 3 ) .  C hildren with mixed enjoyment  were also more likely to obtain  5+ A*-C GCSE’s  than children who did not enjoy  school,   but the association was weaker  (OR :  1. 28 ;  95% CI:  1.0 2 ,  1.6 ) .  These associations  were greater than sex differences in the odds of obtaining 5+ A*-C GCSE’s (OR :  1. 50 ;  95% CI:  1.3 8 ,  1.6 2 ).  The  associations with  levels of school enjoyment  were  attenuated  after adjustment for socioeconomic position  and cognitive ability   ( OR :  1 . 48 ;  95% CI:  1. 16 ,  1.9   and  OR :  1. 27 ;  95% CI:  0.97 ,  1.66  respectively ) .   The association of  enjoyment  and  achievement  was  smaller than  associations of  occupational social class  and  maternal education differences  with  achievement .  C ontrolling for  all covariates   further  attenuated the association for children who enjoyed school (OR :   1. 29 ;  95% CI:  0.99,  1.67 )  and   those  who had mixed enjoyment  (OR :  1. 18 ;  95% CI:  0.9, 1.55 ).  Performance in the  cognitive ability   test  was the strongest predictor of   achievement ; a one standard deviation  increase in  cognitive ability   was associated with  over  three times higher odds  of obtaining 5+ A*-C GCSE’s  ( OR :  3. 1 ;  95% CI:  2. 88  to 3. 34 s ).  The complete case analyses overestimated the association between school enjoyment  and  achievement  but was otherwise consistent with the imputed dataset (Supplementary Table s  S 6  & S 7 )."
"42" "B oth linear and logistic models  provided  strong evidence for associations between the home learning environment and achievement  (β:  3.34 ; 95% CI:  2.06, 4.61 ; OR:  1.07 ; 95% CI:  1.03, 1.12 )  , and between  a child’s confidence in their intelligence and achievement (β:  3.62 ; 95% CI:  2.65, 4.6 ; OR:  1.09 ; 95% CI:  1.05, 1.13 ) .  There is however no strong evidence for associations with achievement between  child’s opinion of their teacher, temperament, confidence in work ability, or the quality of their friendship group ; these are either estimated to be small or  with imprecision ."
"43" "There was  little  evidence  of  interaction s  in  either the linear or logistic  complete case  analyses  between school enjoyment and each of social class  (interaction   value s =0. 265   and  0. 473  respectively ) ,  maternal  education  ( =0. 617 ;  =0. 591 ) ,   cognitive ability   ( =0. 867 ;  = 0. 243 ) , or   pupil’s  sex ( =0. 084 ;  =0. 174 )   on GCSE  achievement .   These interaction results should be interpreted with caution given the limited statistical power that exists to estimate them in the complete case sample.  Figure 2 plots the sex enjoyment differences on achievement   and  demonstrate s   that while  the  gradient is steeper for males  than females , there is insufficient precision  in the estimates to draw firm conclusions of differences ."

"45" "Discussion"
"46" "Our  results  highlight the  potential  importance of  school enjoyment  for educational  achievement .  Children in our sample who enjoyed school  at age 6  scored   on averag e   29.34  more GCSE points  at age 16  and  were  64 %  more likely to  attain 5 or more A*-C grades than children who did not enjoy school.   Because the point s   score  measure ,  we use is a capped fine graded point score for GCSE’s at the time the cohort were in school, this represents a  total  difference of around 5 grades  across the best eight GCSE’s .  Given the importance of  having  5+ A*-C GCSE grades   to  progress  in to further education  and  enter skilled jobs in the labour market   (Payne, 2003) ,  school enjoyment  m ay   provide  an early indicator  of   pupils in need of  more  or   better  educational  support .  Our results corroborate those from previous studies on school enjoyment contemporaneously measured with  achievement  (Larson et al., 1985; Lüftenegger et al., 2016; Tze et al., 2016)  and extend this to exams set 10 years after enjoyment was measured.  That enjoying school is positively associated with  achievement  may  be  intuitive  (Smith et al., 2016) ,  but  it is remarkable that  school enjoyment as early as age six  explains differences  GCSE outcomes  a decade  later  so well.  The  differences in  achievement  by  enjoyment were  almost as large as  differences by parent al  occupational social class   and  sex ,   which have been  widely acknowledged to be intervention worthy inequalities  (Strand, 2011) .  Furthermore, t he binary indicators of school enjoyment that we used likely provided only a crude measure of the underlying  liability or  variation in school enjoyment  amongst  children . Better measurement of school enjoyment in future studies will help better understand the role that school enjoyment plays in educational  achievement ."
"47" "A ssociations  of  school enjoyment and  achievement  were not explained by  other factors  that are strongly related to education  including   socioeconomic position ,   cognitive ability  and the home learning environment   (Bynner and Joshi, 2002; Crawford et al., 2011; Deary et al., 2007; Morris et al., 2016) .  There was attenuation in estimated effect sizes whereby children who enjoyed school  at age 6 scored on average  14.41  more GCSE points at age 16 and were  29 % more likely to attain 5 or more A*-C grades than children who did not enjoy school.  These findings   sug gest  that enjoyment  of the learning environment  reflects more than  a  propensity for innate  cognitive ability   or curiosity to learn  (Alberti and Witryol, 1994; Henderson and Wilson, 1991)  and  may  capture   something unique to education al outcomes .   There is, of course, very high overlap between what  cognitive ability   test s  seek to measure and what most GCSEs are designed to measure.  Furthermore, the  general  lack of social patterning in enjoyment that we observed  is surprising and  suggests that  children’s enjoyment does not just reflect social norms or  parental  behaviours that are patterned by socioeconomic position  (Flouri, 2006) .   Associations between school enjoyment and achievement were also robust to other child level factors such as opinion of teachers, temperament, confidence in work and intelligence, and quality of friendship groups. While these data are insufficient for drawing causal inferences, these findings provide support  for  the  notion that  the  relationship between school enjoyment and achievement may reflect a role of general school enjoyment in early childhood on later academic performance rather than differences driven by other child level factors.  Because s chool enjoyment  is more modifiable than socioeconomic factors  (Smith et al., 2016)   it  potentially  represent s  a  promising  intervention  target for  improving  educational  outcomes .  However, replication of these findings in other settings is required before interventions can be developed to improve enjoyment and evaluated to see if improving enjoyment translates to better educational outcomes.  However, f or the purposes of identifying children who may need greater educational support, our results suggest that a simple measure of school enjoyment at an early age may have long term predictive value to educators.  One important implication from these findings is that  some children gain little enjoyment from schooling .  Further studies are required to explore the reasons that  some children do not enjoy school ."
"48" "S trong gender differences  existed  whereby boys were more likely to  dislike  school than girls , conforming to previous research  (Siann et al., 1996) .  We found  little  evidence  of  i nteraction s   between  school enjoyment and  achievement  by sex ,  but  we had  limited statistical power to investigate these .  It is possible that s chool enjoyment  play s  a more  important  role in  boys’   than girls’  education .  Gender differences in education  may reflect gender specific motivational differences  (Freudenthaler et al., 2008)   or  teacher biases  (Campbell, 2015)   which could lead  to differential  performance.   Further work  on larger samples  is required to  examine if gender differences  exist   in the relationship between enjoyment and achievement ,  to investigate the  reasons  that underlie  gender differences in school enjoyment ,   and  to determine  how  they  could  be reduced.   C hildren  who  were  younger in each  school  cohort were  more likely to have lower achievement  than those who were older , consistent with prior research into age and achievement  (Mayer and Knutson, 1999; Tymms et al., 2000) .   However, we found  little  evidence that school enjoyment was patterned by age in year.  The re is  continued  debate about the  impact of  inflexible school starting ages used in some countries such as the UK  (Sharp, 2002) , and our results highlight that  while  children born later in the school year may perform less well in school , in our sample they do not  derive  any  less enjoyment from schooling .  Future work on samples from countries which have flexible school starting ages is required to see if these associations persist.  From a statistical point of view, age in year  may  provide a valid instrument for instrumental variables analysis into the impacts of education ."
"49" "This study has  several  limitations.  First,  the  ALSPAC cohort  does not provide a representative sample of the UK school population,  meaning that  o ur results may not be generalisable to the wider population of UK school children.  Future research  conducted  on population representative samples  is  required  for  generalis ability of these findings.  That said ,  the associations that we investigated  can be expected to hold in the wider population  provided that participation in ALSPAC  was  not  heavily stratified by school enjoyment and educational  achievement  (Munafò et al., 2017) .   Second, while multiple imputation improved the sample size of our study and permitted inclusion of more participants than the complete case analysis, numerous assumptions are built into the data generating process that we used for the imputations. If important information were not included in the imputation process, then the imputation and subsequent results will be biased. Future research on datasets with a greater number of complete cases is required to demonstrate the replicability  and external validity  of these results.  However, the results from the multiple imputation sample are likely to be  less biased  than those from our complete case sample  because multiple imputation  recovers participants and observation values that are excluded from complete case analyses.  Where missingness is patterned with respect to variables included in the analyses,  estimates from complete case samples may  suffer from selection  bias .  Furthermore, our use of auxiliary variables in the imputation model  will have  account ed  for underlying patterns in missingness that  would not have been otherwise accounted for   (Hughes et al., 2019; Madley-Dowd et al., 2019) .  Third ,  the associations here are estimated from observational data and therefore may arise due to  further confounding factors  between  school enjoyment and educational  achievement  that we did not control for .   Our results were robust to adjustment  for  some of  the strongest drivers of educational  achievement  in the UK (family socioeconomic position, sex, ethnicity , age )   (Strand, 2011)  so it is  unlikely  that unobserved confounding will  induce sufficiently  large bias  to explain  our results .  Fourth ,  because we  condition our analysis on  measure s  of  cognitive ability , confidence in work and   intelligence, and friendship groups  that  were  collected after the school enjoyment data ,  it is possible that  this  induce d   collider  bias into our results   (Elwert and Winship, 2014) .   Confounder variables  should exert a downstream influence  on  exposure and outcome  variables ,  and therefore  adjusting for  post-exposure  variables  can introduce bias .  Ability   as measured by cognitive tests is highly stable  over time   (Deary et al., 2000) ,   meaning that our use of a  cognitive ability   measure  obtained  two years after school enjoyment is unlikely to induce  sufficient  collider bias   to invalidate our  results .  Our intuition  is that a child’s confidence in their work , confidence in their  intelligence ,   and satisfaction with their friendship groups  may vary  over time  in a manner  that relates to school enjoyment .   Given this, i t is therefore  possible t h at  our results may be  subject to  collider  bias  induced by conditioning on downstream covariates .  However, multiple imputation  is expected to be less susceptible to this form of collider bias  as analyses are not entirely conditioned on  downstream data  availability . The consistency in results between our complete case and multiple imputation analyse therefore provides confidence that our analyses are not strongly biased .   There  are  no earlier measure s  of  these variables   in ALSPAC  (or for cognitive ability no earlier measures  wit h  large enough  sample size )  to explore the potential impact of collider bias, but f uture research  using data sets   that have  these variables   and  school  enjoyment measured contemporaneously  could  explore  this .  Finally,  our  measure of how much the  participants  like their teachers  may  not relate to the teacher that they had when they reported school enjoyment. It is  conceivable that where a child’s school enjoyment is tied closely to relationship with their teacher , discordant reporting of school enjoyment and  how much they like their teacher may lead to bias in our  results ."
"50" "In conclusion, our results suggest  that  school enjoyment  at  age 6 strongly associates with educational achievement  at  completion of compulsory schooling , and is not strongly patterned by  family social background . D ifferences in  achievement  by school enjoyment are almost as large as socioeconomic and gender differences,  and  enjoyment-achievement  associations  are independent of these  and other child level factors .  Further  observational and experimental  s tudies  into school enjoyment  in  other samples and schooling contexts  are required  to  improve understanding of the drivers of school enjoyment and  evaluate  the potential  of interventions to improve  children’s enjoyment of schooling  for  educational  achievement ."
