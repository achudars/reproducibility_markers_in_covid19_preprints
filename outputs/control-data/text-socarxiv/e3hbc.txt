Crowdsourcing Bicycle Volumes: Exploring the Role of
Volunteered Geographic Information and Established
Monitoring Methods
Greg P. Griffin and Junfeng Jiao
Abstract: The recent interest in performance measures and new bicycle infrastructure development has triggered rapid
advancements in monitoring methods for active transportation, but comprehensive monitoring programs for the bicycle
mode are far from ubiquitous. This study evaluates the use of GPS survey data and a new crowdsourced volume dataset
that may offer promise to extend the reach of limited counting programs. The authors integrated count data from five
separate trail locations in Austin, Texas, with a previous survey using the CycleTracks smartphone application and a new
data product derived from a larger-scale use of the Strava fitness application. New crowdsourced methods offer a prospect of
expanding the relative time and geography of bicycle traffic monitoring, but do not currently offer many other attributes
about trips obtainable from other methods. Further studies involving the combination of high-accuracy monitoring points
with crowdsourced datasets may improve the efficiency of monitoring programs over large areas.

INTRODUCTION

Currently, bicycle volume data is not typically gathered by transportation agencies, despite the fact that several new methods
to count bicycle volumes have been developed in recent years
(Nordback and Janson 2010, Ryan and Lindsey 2013). Methods
to incorporate nonmotorized volume data as a regular practice
only were introduced to the Federal Highway Administration’s
Traffic Monitoring Guide in 2013 (U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration 2013), and the cost
and perceived importance of counting this mode may continue
to be a barrier to increased data development. This paper begins
with a review of these challenges and opportunities reflected in the
literature, and employs temporal and geographic analysis to review
two community-contributed geographic datasets developed in
the Austin, Texas, area, with actual count data from bicycle traffic counters on five locations of the downtown trail system. The
method demonstrates that some data sources are likely to vary in
the proportion of actual volumes.
This study addresses a need to evaluate current datasets
that may extend the value of bicycle counting programs through
volumes contributed by other means. Significant progress in
institutionalizing bicycle and pedestrian monitoring has been
made in Colorado, Minnesota, and Oregon, and agencies are
searching for efficient solutions to fill this need (Lindsey, Nordback, and Figliozzi 2014; Nordback and Janson 2010; Nordback 2014). A recent Transportation Research Board circular
summarized a number of recent and ongoing studies in the
realm of active transportation monitoring methods and identified a need to continue research in crowdsourced volume data
sources (Griffin, Nordback, Götschi, Stolz, and Kothuri 2014).
The concept of crowdsourcing information on improving

bicycling conditions is not new, but the datasets and tools for their
analysis are continuing to expand. Indeed, the Federal Highway
Administration’s Bicycle Compatibility Index, developed in the
late 1990s, is predicated on multiple users’ perspective of a
video-based evaluation of roadways (Harkey, Reinfurt, and
Knuiman 1998). Krykewycz et al. expanded the bicycle level of
service concept with Web-based crowdsourcing, allowing a localized valuation of “bikeability” (Krykewycz, Pollard, Canzoneri,
and He 2011). This very concept of asking for public input on
the fundamental components of a decision-making process that
is traditionally technically driven (e.g., roadway conditions, traffic volumes, etc.) is by itself a paradigm shift (Brabham 2009;
Connors, Lei, and Kelly 2011; Elwood, Goodchild, and Sui 2013;
Schlossberg and Brehm 2009; Schlossberg and Shuford 2005;
Tulloch 2008). The idea of crowdsourcing may be merging
with transportation practitioners’ notions of survey-based input,
both for travel surveys and public engagement in planning
(Akar and Clifton 2009, Shen and Stopher 2014).
Two principal research questions posed in this study are:
1. At a given location, what proportion of total bicycle volumes
are reflected in a global positioning system (GPS) travel
survey and a new crowdsourced dataset?
2. How do GPS surveys and crowdsourced methods vary in
terms of trip purpose?
These questions are explored by corroborating trail count
values from recording equipment, along with comparison of
a smartphone-based GPS survey and a crowdsourced bicycle
volume dataset.

DATA SOURCES

In addition to bicycle traffic counts recorded with pneumatic
tubes, this study takes advantage of a previous study using the
smartphone application CycleTracks (Sall n.d.) and a new crowdsourced data product called Strava Metro (Albergotti 2014).
Recent availability of accurate trail counts for the Austin area,
along with the recent CycleTracks study and new Strava Metro
data allow unique comparisons.
Because all five trail locations include at least one week’s
worth of data in 15-minute increments, evaluation of bicycle
volumes by time of day and day of week is possible. The trail
counts were gathered with Eco-counter pneumatic tubes, and the
counts on the Lance Armstrong Bikeway were gathered using an
automatic traffic recorder (ATR) developed by Eco-counter that
uses inductive loops to count passing bicycles.
CycleTracks, a smartphone application developed by the San
Francisco County Transportation Authority, has been employed
and adapted for use in several other cities (Sall n.d.). It was applied in an Austin area study in 2011, and the current study
incorporates its summarized traffic volumes (Hudson, Duthie,
Yatinkumar, Larsen, and Meyer 2012). CycleTracks is essentially
a GPS-based travel diary that gathers additional valuable information such as trip purpose and demographics that passive data
collection techniques do not.
Strava is a popular smartphone-based, GPS-supported fitness
application that records route volume information now sold as
Strava Metro, which the creators describe as “. . . aggregate[ing]
collective real world cycling preferences in real time with the
purpose of enabling state and local departments of transportation
as well as advocacy groups and corporations to make informed
and effective choices when improving and repairing alternative
transportation corridors” (Strava Inc. 2014b). Though this dataset
includes a trip purpose attribute derived from a proprietary algorithm addressing factors such as whether a trip had a coincident
origin and destination (personal communication, Brian Riordan,
February 19, 2014), all trips were used in this assessment without
analyzing trip purpose.
Each of these data sources provides a type of potential bicycle

volume data, but they must be normalized in terms of the type
of volume data to be comparable, and they must overlap spatially
to remove spatial effects on traffic volumes. Table 1 describes the
locations and times of the three separate data sources.
The crowdsourced dataset covers the entire roadway network
in a given area, which is a major change from existing monitoring
methods focused on individual points. Previously, bicycle volumes covering entire networks only could be estimated through
modeling. Though a variety of cursory sketch-level and more
sophisticated models have been developed, very few transportation
agencies apply them, partially because of a lack of traffic counts
(Griffin et al. 2014; Griffin 2009; Kuzmyak, Walters, Bradley, and
Kockelman 2014). The crowdsourced dataset, depicting traffic
volumes during the week of August 9 to 15, 2013, in Austin,
Texas, is depicted in Figure 1. Strava users are bicycling on a variety
of Austin roadways, but the highest volumes are found on state
highways with wide shoulders in Austin’s western, hillier areas.
A great deal of the other high-volume bicycling is distributed
throughout the city, most having either bicycle lanes or low traffic volumes and speeds. As described later, this dataset is limited
for it characterizes only Strava users, and taking a first glimpse
at the differences between these crowdsourcing contributors and
all bicyclists is a central question of this study.
While the bicycle traffic counts by definition include all
bicyclists passing a given point, the survey and crowdsourced
datasets are merely a sample of the entire population. Of those
that reported a gender in the CycleTracks study, 30 percent were
female, which is seven percent less than a national study of all
bicyclists from 2002 (Hudson et al. 2012). Participants also
skewed younger than the general population, though the study
cannot reflect the population because it was targeted towards
adults. Similarly, the users of Strava Metro are less than onequarter female and skew younger than the general population.
Comparison of American Community Survey demographic
estimates within Travis County, Texas, with the Strava Metro
community in August o f 2013 in the same county is depicted
in Figure 2. Though the Strava community is strongly skewed
male, a gender study of the included trails necessary for precise
qualification was not part of this study.

STUDY AREA

Austin is used as a case study location because of the availability
of the previous CycleTracks study, a newly available Strava
Metro sample dataset, and bicycle volumes from portable
pneumatic tube counters and two automatic traffic recorders
(ATRs) positioned on the Lance Armstrong Bikeway at its crossings of Shoal Creek and Waller Creek (see Figure 3). The ATRs
began recording bidirectional bicycle and pedestrian volumes in
15-minute increments in January of 2011; however, the one
at the crossing of Shoal Creek has been removed because of
construction in the area.
Downtown Austin, Texas, is a relatively dense, mixed-use
district with an on-street and off-street network of bicycle facilities connecting a multitude of destinations, including restaurants,
parks, and offices (Halff Associates Inc. 2014). Austin launched
a bicycle sharing system on December 21, 2013, and has expanded to 40 stations as of spring of 2014 (B-Cycle 2014). The
data used in this study all preceded the launch of this system,
so this system was not a factor in the traffic volumes reviewed.
The off-street bicycle network includes a variety of materials, but most are at least three to four meters (10 to 13 feet) in
width. The trails surrounding and connecting to Lady Bird Lake
are predominantly surfaced with decomposed granite, and are
more popular for running and walking than as specific bicycle
routes. Construction on the Lance Armstrong Bikeway began
in 2007, and the last section of its almost ten-kilometer (six-

mile) downtown is a cycle track facility under development as
of this writing.
Researchers chose five specific monitoring locations shown
in Figure 3 because they found the city of Austin had recorded
bicycle counts at these locations during the same duration as
the available Strava sample dataset, enabling synchronous comparison. These locations happen to be located along each side
of popular entrances to downtown, and were anticipated to
provide options for a range of potential trip purposes. All five
monitoring locations in this study are off-street, shared-use paths
in downtown Austin, Texas, that are on facilities accessible to a
wide range of bicycling skill levels, in areas that can serve business,
shopping, and recreation destinations.

METHODOLOGY

The traffic counts, survey, and crowdsourced data were compiled
in a geographic information system (GIS) to coordinate comparisons of values at the five study points.
Temporal analysis of the bicyclist counts reveals they have
differing traffic patterns over the course of a day and throughout
the week. Figure 4 illustrates bicyclist volumes by hour for a full
week, with most sites exhibiting a pattern generally associated
with utilitarian riding with stiff peaks during morning and
evening commute times. Because these sites also are located
within an urban context near live music and nightlife, there is

datasets were reviewed according to Turner and Lasley (2013),
finding no significant erroneous data.
The Lance Armstrong Bikeway crossing Waller Creek has a
unique pattern, as it provides several services for bicyclists in
Austin. In addition to being a comfortable facility serving the
downtown commuter rail station, it is the only crossing of
Interstate 35 that is separated from vehicle traffic within the

URISA Journal • Griffin, Jiao

city. Therefore, it is likely that this facility is highly used for a
wider variety of purposes than are similar paths.
The weekly spread of bicyclists also is associated with various trip purposes identified in the literature (Lindsey, Hankey,
Wang, and Chen 2013; Roll 2013). Previous studies generally
indicated volumes gradually increased during the week towards
Friday, often with more traffic on weekend days. The fairly flat
patterns in Figure 5 are associated with multiple trip purposes
spread over the week. The strong increase of the Lady Bird

61

Lake Trail and Shoal Creek Trail sites on Saturday are likely
related to their settings within larger downtown parks and
may reflect more emphasis on recreation.
Miranda-Moreno et al. developed classification factors for
trip purpose based on the day of week and time of peak travel
to estimate the predominant travel use of a given facility (2013).
The following formulas offer comparability on trail traffic with
recent work by Hankey, Lindsey, and Marshall (2014). The first
formula calculates an index of weekday versus weekend traffic,
noted as WWI. The second is the average morning commute
period (7 to 9 a.m.) divided by the midday (11 a.m. to 1 p.m,)
traffic, AMI.
This line of research logically assumes that sites with a higher
ratio of weekend traffic versus weekday can reasonably be considered to have a predominantly recreational use. This temporal
factor is further bolstered by examining the ratio of morning
traffic to midday traffic, following that a higher AMI (relative
morning trips versus midday) is associated with commute or
utilitarian traffic. Because this study includes results from a GPS
survey using the CycleTracks application, the five sites in Austin
have actual trip purposes allocated to individual routes, which
are reviewed in the next section by comparing WWI and AMI
against actual recorded trip purposes.
To evaluate the overall relationship between the counted
volumes and the CycleTracks survey and Strava Metro data, the
final method applies ordinary least squares regression.

RESULTS

To compare the surveyed and crowdsourced traffic volumes
with the total traffic volume, the researchers coordinated the
datasets over time and location. The CycleTracks and Strava
Metro datasets were collected over different time spans, May 1
to August 31, 2011, and August 9 to15, 2013, respectively. The
Lance Armstrong Bikeway was counted using the automatic traffic recorders during the CycleTracks period, and the remaining
trails were counted by the city of Austin using pneumatic tubes
during the Strava Metro dataset recording time. The average
daily bicycle (ADB) volumes are several times higher on the
Lance Armstrong Bikeway through downtown than on the trails
nearest Lady Bird Lake.
In terms of proportions of the full traffic as reflected in the
counts, Table 2 shows the CycleTracks survey included a very small
proportion of the total volume, less than a tenth of one percent of
the volume of the two traffic recorders on the Lance Armstrong
Bikeway. As the original study in Austin (Hudson et al. 2012) and
this evaluation shows, the advantage of a GPS survey is its balance
of breadth of coverage with depth of information. However, the
Strava Metro dataset includes a much larger proportion of the
total bicycle traffic on the three trail counting sites that coincided
with the Strava Metro data from August 9 to 15, 2013, including
almost five percent of the total traffic.
Similar to Hankey, Lindsey, and Marshall (2014), this study
has access to a small sample size of five locations with counts at
least a week long, thus factoring trip purposes is limited. Shown
62

in Table 3, results of the relative weekend versus weekday traffic
(WWI) is not consistent with the index of morning to midday
traffic (AMI). However, they all include midrange values, reflecting multiple uses of the trail system. This is consistent with the
downtown location in parkland, but surrounded by employment,
densifying residential areas, with retail and other uses.
At this stage of refinement of bicycle factor groups and trip
purposes, no known studies of volume-based factor group classifications and user-surveyed trip purposes exist. A previous study
by Hudson, et al. using the CycleTracks application (Hudson et
al. 2012) and the new Strava Metro data product (Kitchel and
Riordan 2014) allows comparison on the actual trail sites, though
separated in time.
Table 3 summarizes results of the trip purpose comparison,
though the trail counts, CycleTracks GPS survey, and Strava
Metro crowdsourced data all vary in total counts and time
periods. Though the CycleTracks data is the smallest sample in
this study, it provides the only direct insight into trip purpose,
for it asks participants to categorize each trip among one of six
purposes: commute, errands, school, exercise, social, and other.
Strava Metro includes a number of commute trips that is inferred
through GIS-based rules such as the trip beginning and ending
at locations more than a certain distance apart, though the full
algorithm is proprietary (personal communication, Brian Riordan, February 19, 2014). Because Strava is a fitness-oriented
application (Strava Inc. 2014a), this study allocates all trips not
designated as commute purposes as recreational. In each of the
four trip purpose categorization methods, the three trails in park
settings had the highest proportion of recreational trips. This
finding is compatible with the authors’ familiarity with each
of the five sites.
Because the Lance Armstrong Bikeway is designed as a concrete facility with proper width and sightlines for all bicycling
purposes, and it directly connects multiple destinations, it is
likely used more for commuting and other utilitarian purposes,
in addition to recreation. Its western end at Shoal Creek (closed
of this writing for construction) is located at the edge of
parkland reaching in to the western side of downtown. This
corroborates its more recreation-oriented values in each of the
methods, as compared with the Lance Armstrong Bikeway’s
crossing of Waller Creek on the east side of downtown Austin
The overall relationship of the five counted locations with
the survey and crowdsourced data was evaluated using ordinary least squares regression and additional measures of spatial
autocorrelation using OpenGeoDa software (Anselin, Syabri,
and Kho 2006). Inclusion of both the CycleTracks and Strava
Metro as independent variables resulted in a 0.95 R-squared
(0.90 adjusted R-squared), but neither variable met statistical
significance tests for a 95 percent confidence interval, likely
because of the small number of sites involved. Spatial autoorrelation is indicated with a Moran’s I value of 3.49 and with an
associated probability of 0.0005. Tests of both the Breusch-Pagan
and Koenker-Bassett have insignificant probabilities at 0.6 and
0.5, respectively, indicating no significant heteroskedasticity.

These values are consistent with comparison of the values on
the trails near each other in relatively similar urban contexts.
Additional monitoring points would need to be included to
draw additional conclusions based on regression methods.

CONCLUSION

Through in-depth analysis of three bicycle volume data sources
at five locations in Austin, Texas, this study demonstrates that
crowdsourced datasources, sometimes included in the “big
data” discourse, show promise as a legitimate tool for evaluating
volumes of bicyclists. The relative sparseness of bicycle volume
counts performed restricts analysis of various performance
measures addressing safety, health, air quality, livability, and
URISA Journal • Griffin, Jiao

44 (163)

other factors. Additional crowdsourced data sources and the
increasing volume and opportunities for temporal comparison
through time will indicate this study may serve an important
role in the growing field of active transportation monitoring.
The growing literature on bicycle traffic monitoring has
demonstrated solid methods for counting and evaluating volumes
on a range of infrastructure types, but no studies have previously addressed the challenge of how to fill enormous gaps of
unfunded data needs to acquire volume data on the majority
of roadways. Figure 1 shows the extent of geographic coverage
offered by this method, and this study begins to characterize
the differences between users of a fitness-oriented application
that crowdsources bicycle volumes and the larger population in
63

an area. Crowdsourced methods offer prospect to help fill the
dearth of bicycle volume data, and this study demonstrates the
percentage of one proprietary source of data ranging between
2.8 percent and 8.8 percent of all users on trails in downtown
Austin, Texas. This study’s methods could be replicated in other
locations to determine locally consistent factors of crowdsourced
data contributors. Considering that the only previously available
method to estimate volumes on most roadways was implementation of sophisticated nonmotorized travel models, crowdsourced
traffic volumes offer significant opportunities to improve largearea data used in planning for active transportation, though
subject to significant limitations at this time.
In terms of time-based factoring and trip purposes, this
study provides further evidence that the bicycle factor groupings
developed by Miranda-Moreno et al. (2013) later extended to
mixed-mode trail traffic by Hankey et al. ( 2014) generally are
supported by the CycleTracks trip purpose responses. Researchers and practitioners are urged caution in the application of a
potentially growing field of crowdsourced datasets, for they may
or may not represent the given population that is considered in a
transportation planning context. Furthermore, the performance
measures facilitated by traffic volumes standing alone should
not be mistaken for a comprehensive and ethical planning
process (Appleyard, Ferrell, Carroll, and Taecker 2014).
Notwithstanding the limitations discussed in the following section, crowd-sourced so-called “big data” offers great
promise but has to be put in its place. Richard Shearmur (2015)
describes the issue succinctly, “however big the data, Big Data
are not about society, but about users and markets” (p. 3). The
authors are trying to highlight the discrepancy, cognizant that
the data skewing generally matches the male orientation towards
fitness cycling in the United States. There are other useful evaluations of the use of big data, but the novelty of this work lies
in the triangulation of bicycle volumes with three data sources
at the same place.

characteristics of focused counts along with the spatial extent
of crowdsourcing.

LIMITATIONS AND FURTHER
RESEARCH

The authors appreciate Aleksiina Chapman of the City of Austin
Transportation Department for providing the trail bicycle counts
and Brian Riordian of Strava Inc. for providing early access to
the Strava Metro data used in this study. No external funding
supported the study.

The number of available weeklong counts restricts the number
of factor groups and, therefore, the accuracy of expansion of
crowdsourced volumes. In addition, the relatively small number
of trips recorded through the CycleTracks GPS survey does not
meet statistical thresholds to represent the locations in this study,
perhaps with the exception of the Lance Armstrong Bikeway at
Waller Creek (n = 102). An intercept survey with a question on
trip purpose such as that developed by Forsyth et al. (Forsyth,
Agrawal, and Krizek 2012) should be implemented to further
evaluate this study’s findings within other contexts. Acquisition
of additional location site counts of at least one-week duration following recent guidance (Figliozzi, Johnson, Monsere,
and Nordback 2014; Nordback and Janson 2010; Turner and
Lasley 2013; U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration 2013) could allow spatial extrapolation of
