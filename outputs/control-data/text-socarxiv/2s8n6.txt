Abstract: Educational disadvantages of migrant students are a persistent
problem in many Western countries. Against this background, policymakers
often call for more diversity in the teacher workforce, assuming that migrant
students might benefit from being taught by a migrant teacher. Despite the
popularity of this claim, there is almost no research-based rationale for
increasing the diversity of teachers in Europe. This paper is a step to fill this
research gap for Germany. We aim to assess whether migrant teachers reduce
ethnic educational disadvantages. Our analyses are based on the ‘IQB National
Assessment Study on Languages 2008/2009’, a nationally representative
large-scale assessment study of ninth-graders that provides information on
migration status of both students and teachers. Our dependent variables are
objective German language competence scores and teacher-assigned grades.
Results run contrary to the widely held expectations. We find virtually no
evidence that migrant students benefit from being taught by a migrant teacher.

Introduction
Educational disadvantages of migrant students are a persistent problem in Germany, as in many
other Western countries (e.g. Heath and Brinbaum, 2014; OECD, 2015; Kristen and Granato,
2007; Levels et al., 2008). Against this background, policymakers as well as researchers often
call for more diversity in the teacher workforce, assuming that migrant students might benefit
from being taught by migrant or ethnic minority teachers (cf. Schofield, 2006: 97 ff.;
Heckmann, 2008: 83; Donlevy et al, 2016: 13; Die Bundesregierung, 2007: 67; U.S.
Department of Education, 2016). These teachers are expected to know better about cultural
differences and structural barriers – or opportunities – for migrants, are assumed to be less
1

biased in their assessment of migrant students, and – last but not least – may serve as a role
model (for reviews see Mantel and Leutwyler, 2013; for the U.S. see Villegas and Irvine, 2010).
In the recent debate on the integration of refugee (and other migrant) students in German
schools, this policy has received even more support (cf. Panagiotopoulou, Rosen and Strzykala,
2017, Robert Bosch Expert Commission to Consider a Realignment of Refugee Policy, 2016:
27). Over the past years, several initiatives have been launched to recruit migrant students for
teacher training (e.g. Gemeinnützige Hertie-Stiftung, 2016; Zeit-Stiftung Ebelin und Gerd
Bucerius, 2016).
Given the popularity of this political claim, there is almost no research-based rationale
for increasing the diversity of teachers in Europe. Driessen (2015) who reviewed the
quantitative empirical literature on the relation between teacher and student ethnicity, and
student outcomes, identified 24 studies focusing on primary and secondary education in the
United States, but none for European countries. The U.S. findings, which we report below,
cannot be generalized to European countries that differ in terms of migrant populations,
migration histories, and education systems. The literature in Germany and other European
countries has so far been mainly qualitative and is often concerned with the self-perception of
migrant teachers (for a review see Georgi, 2013). Quantitative–empirical studies comparing
students taught by migrant resp. non-migrant teachers are widely lacking. A notable exception
is Neugebauer and Klein (2016) who investigate whether migrant children in German
preschools reach higher cognitive and social skills when matched to a migrant kindergarten
teacher. However, research on this question at the school level is missing to the best of our
knowledge. This paper is a step to fill this research gap for Germany, and we ask: Do migrant
students benefit from being taught by a migrant teacher?
To answer our research question, we provide a review of the theoretical arguments for
diversifying the teacher workforce and discuss how they may or may not apply to Germany.
For the empirical analyses, we use a large-scale dataset that provides information about
migration background of both students and teachers for a sufficient number of cases: the IQB
National Assessment Study on Languages 2008/2009, a study of ninth-graders and their
teachers. First, to elaborate on possible systematic differences between teachers with and
without migration background, we compare teachers along a range of characteristics. Second,
and more importantly, we look at migrant and non-migrant students who are taught by migrant
or non-migrant teachers in terms of two central educational outcomes: students’ objective
German language competence scores and their teacher-assigned grades in German.

Theoretical Background and Previous Research
Why Migrant Teachers May Make a Difference
Little is known about the characteristics of migrants who choose teaching as a vocation.
Research on minority teachers from the U.S. suggests that black teacher candidates score lower
on teacher licensure tests than non-Hispanic white teacher candidates (Gitomer et al., 2011).
After having entered the teaching workforce, a higher proportion of black and Hispanic teachers
do not have a college degree, and they are more likely to teach in high-risk districts (Kirby et
al., 1999). Whether such patterns of minority teachers in the U.S. are similar for migrant
teachers in Europe, a very heterogeneous group that differs greatly from ethnic or racial
minority teachers in the U.S., is to our knowledge largely unknown. What we do know is that,
across Europe, the share of migrant teachers is substantially lower than the share of migrant
students (Donlevy et al., 2016). In Germany, for example, migrant teachers1 account for about
6 per cent of all teachers in secondary schools in Germany, but one third of the students have a
migration background (Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung, 2012: Tab D4-7web). This
imbalance can be problematic if migrant teachers are beneficial to different facets of migrant
students' success in education. In the following, we discuss several theoretical arguments in
favour of this link. We distinguish theoretical approaches focussing on (1) students’
achievement and (2) teachers’ evaluations, given a certain achievement level.
(1) Many scholars and commentators assume the mere presence of migrant teachers to
be beneficial to migrant students’ educational success. A commonly cited mechanism is that
migrant students, especially those living in disadvantaged settings, benefit from ethnic role
models (e.g. Dee, 2004; Goldhaber et al., 2015; Marx et al., 2009), who may serve as examples
of successful upward social mobility through education and show that it is possible for migrants
to obtain a respectable, professional occupation. These role models might encourage migrant
students to invest into education and pursue higher educational attainment. Similarly, having a
migrant teacher may reduce migrant students’ stereotype threat, i.e. the phenomenon that
students tend to perform worse when they fear being evaluated through the lens of a negative
stereotype about the group they belong to (Steele, 1997; cf. Strasser und Steber, 2010). Another
argument suggests that migrant teachers may have higher academic expectations of migrant
students than native teachers (Gershenson et al., 2016). Beginning with Rosenthal and
Jacobson’s (1968) seminal ‘pygmalion on the classroom’ study, a broad literature examines the
1

This includes persons with own migration experience (first generation) and persons whose parents migrated to
Germany (second generation).
3

impact of teacher expectations on students’ achievement (Cherng, 2017; Jussim et al., 2009;
Schofield, 2006; for Germany: Lorenz et al., 2016). If migrant teachers’ expectations of migrant
students are higher than those of non-migrant teachers (see Hauser-Cram et al., 2003; McGrady
and Reynolds, 2013), they may choose more demanding tasks for them, which in turn would
improve the learning progress. Another strand of theoretical considerations supposes an active
role of migrant teachers, leading to higher educational outcomes of migrant students: Migrant
teachers may use other instructional strategies than non-migrant teachers by including materials
and themes that are more relevant for migrant students (cf. Dee and Penner, 2016). In addition,
migrant teachers, based on their own experiences of migration, may be more sensitive to
migrant student’s difficulties in the German society (cf. Rotter, 2012). In the classroom, they
may have a higher awareness of migrant students’ difficulties and are thus more able to provide
them with targeted support (Scheible and Rother, 2017: 26). This might be particularly relevant
in the case of language difficulties. If any of the mentioned arguments hold true for migrant
students in Germany, migrant students should perform better if they are taught by a migrant
teacher (Achievement Hypothesis).
(2) Migrant and non-migrant teachers may differ in their evaluation of (migrant)
students, given a certain achievement level. This might be due to discriminatory evaluations of
teachers, but more subtle processes of teachers’ evaluation biases are conceivable as well. For
example, the U.S. literature suggests that white teachers may be irritated by black students’
behavioural styles (e.g. speech, dress, energy level) and, in consequence, grade black students
more harshly than they deserve (Lindsay and Hart, 2017; Downey and Prisbesh, 2004; Dee,
2005). Another explanation focuses on actual student misbehaviour. Following the notion that
black peers sanction academic striving as ‘acting white’ (Fordham and Ogbu, 1986), Downey
and Prisbesh (2004) argue that black students may be more inclined to actually misbehave when
matched to a white teacher. Such student behaviour may influence teachers’ grading decision,
but not necessarily test scores. If any of these arguments applies to our setting, migrant students
receive better grades if graded by a migrant teacher, conditional on students’ test scores
(Evaluation hypothesis).

Previous Empirical Evidence and Own Contribution
Regarding student’s achievement, a large number of studies in the U.S. examined benefits of
same-race matches. These studies come to inconclusive results – and if there are any (positive)
effects, they are quite small in magnitude. Driessen (2015: 187), in his review article,
summarizes previous research as follows: in 15 studies analysing objective effect measures
4

(mainly student’s test scores), ‘3 (20%) showed a negative effect, 7 (47%) no effect, and 5
(33%) a positive effect’, and if so, it were black students assigned to black teachers who showed
higher achievements. Recent U.S. studies, not covered in Driessen (2015), detect positive
associations (e.g. Egalite et al., 2015; Yarnell and Bohrnstedt, 2017), but even if a significant
positive effect is observed, effect sizes are generally small in magnitude. For example, Egalite
et al. (2015) find that reading test scores of black and white students assigned to race-congruent
teachers improve by .004–.005 standard deviations – i.e. the improvement would presumably
neither be visible in daily school life nor considerably affect final educational attainment. The
empirical results of favourable same-race matches also point to a drawback of increasing
teacher diversity in the schools by unintended ‘negative’ effects for majority students: white
students (also) benefit from being assigned to a same-race teacher (see also Dee, 2004).
Driessen (2015) did not find any study outside of the U.S. that examined objective outcomes,
e.g. student’s test scores. We did not find any quantitative European study either, except for
one recent large-scale study on the association of migrant teachers on Kindergarten children’s
outcomes in Germany by Neugebauer and Klein (2016). Their analyses based on the
Kindergarten cohort of the German National Educational Panel Study (NEPS) finds that
migrant children’s cognitive or social development is not enhanced when being taught by
migrant teachers. Similarly, contact to migrant parents is not improved. These results hold true
for both direct contact in the children’s class and mere presence of any migrant teacher in the
kindergarten.
Whereas empirical findings on student’s achievements are inconclusive, evidence on
teacher’s bias in student evaluation is more consistent. Driessen (2015: 187) concludes that
‘Regarding the subjective effect measures (mostly teacher evaluations of student behaviour),
the share of positive effects dominates; this pertains to more than half of the studies’. Students
tend to receive a higher performance evaluation from teachers who share their racial identity
or, vice versa, non-black teachers have significantly lower expectations and ratings of
educational achievement of black students (see also Ouzad, 2014; Gershenson et al., 2016;
Atkins et al., 2014). This evaluation bias is even more pronounced for students from low
socioeconomic backgrounds (Dee, 2005). In Germany and other European countries, several
studies investigate ethnically biased teacher expectations, grading practises, or track
recommendations (e.g. Lorenz et al., 2016; Van Ewijk, 2011; Sprietsma, 2013; for an overview
see Diehl and Fick, 2016). In an experimental study with German teachers, for example,
Sprietsma (2013) finds some evidence that the same essays received worse grades when
presumably written by a migrant student. However, to our knowledge, none of the European
5

studies has taken into account teachers’ migration status, so we do not know if migrant students
would receive better grades if evaluated by a migrant teacher.
Summing up, previous studies provide mixed evidence for the notion that samerace/ethnic matches are associated with higher achievement or better grades, and if any positive
effect occurred at all, it was of rather small effect size. Several questions arise from our
literature review that both strengthen and weaken the afore-hypothesized positive effect of
migrant teachers on migrant students in Germany:
-

Most of the empirical evidence is from the U.S. and focusses on teachers’ and students’
race. It is an open question whether the concept of racial matches can be transferred to
migrant matches, i.e. to teachers and students sharing a migration history.

-

In contrast to black students in the U.S., many migrant students are first-generation
migrants who do not speak German with their parents at home (e.g. OECD, 2010: 165)
and learn German as a second language. In that case, teaching German may grant
migrant teachers particular leeway to affect migrant students’ achievements positively
(if it is true that migrant teachers are more able to provide targeted language learning
support).

-

The only European study investigating migrant matches focusses on Kindergarten
students (Neugebauer and Klein, 2016). Whether the reported findings can be
transferred to later stages in the education career remains an open question.

Data and Methods
Data
Our analyses are based on the ‘IQB National Assessment Study on Languages 2008/2009’
(Köller, et al., 2011; Sachse et al., 2012), the official national large-scale assessment study to
monitor German language acquisition among ninth-graders. Student competence tests were
supplemented by student and teacher questionnaires, with very high response rates (e.g. > 88
% for the student questionnaires, cf. Köller et al., 2010: 79). The data is unique in two respects:
First, it is one of the very few studies that measures the migration background not only of
students but also of teachers. Second, the large sample size makes it possible to analyze the
rather small group of migrant teachers.2 For our analysis, we had to exclude 6 out of 16 federal

2

An alternative data source is the National Educational Panel Study (NEPS), e.g. starting cohort fifth grade.
However the sample size and, hence, the number of migrant teachers in NEPS is substantially smaller. Because of
the low share of migrants among teachers, case numbers are too low to conduct meaningful analysis.
6

states, in which the teacher questionnaire did not include questions about social and migration
background. Furthermore, we excluded all student–teacher pairings in which teachers or
students did not participate in the questionnaires. We further dropped students with special
educational needs, those who were excluded from the testing, and all students with teachers
who worked with the class for only half a year or less. Finally, we dropped students from
classrooms in which less than five students participated in the competence tests.3 This resulted
in a final sample of 9,262 students, taught in 484 classrooms by 484 teachers.
The first outcome of interest is students’ achievement scores in German. Achievement
was measured very precisely, over a period of 60 minutes and included reading comprehension,
listening comprehension and orthography. The dataset provides five plausible values for each
student and domain, which we analysed jointly (Köller et al., 2010; Mislevy et al., 1992).
According to the researchers responsible for the achievement tests, it is not advisable to
interpret a combined score of the three distinct language domains (Köller et al., 2010: 22). We
followed this recommendation and estimated separate regression models for reading
comprehension, listening comprehension and orthography. The second outcome variable are
teacher-assigned grades in German. The dataset provides the mid-term German school mark in
ninth grade, reported by students’ German class teacher. The original German grading scale
ranges from 1 ‘very good’ to 6 ‘insufficient’. We recoded the scale so that higher scores imply
better grades.
Our major independent variables are the migration background of students and their
teachers. Both student and teacher questionnaires included questions on whether the
respondents themselves or their parents were born abroad. If this was the case for any person,
we considered the respondent as migrant student resp. migrant teacher. Unfortunately, teachers
were not asked about their specific country of birth, nor about their parent’s country of birth.
Therefore, we have to rely on broad dummy indicators for migration background, and cannot
test whether students may profit particularly if they share the same country of origin with the
teacher (see discussion section).
In the multivariate analyses, we include a set of student’s individual background and
classroom characteristics as control variables. On the student level, we include student’s
socioeconomic background by controlling for parents’ highest occupational status (HISEI) and
parental education (ISCED). Furthermore, we control for student’s cultural background by
including the number of books in the household and a factor score of student’s participation in

3

Including these classrooms does not change our findings substantively.
7

cultural activities.4 Moreover, we control for student’s gender, age, age squared and sex. On the
classroom level, we include gender and age of the teacher, the mean highest ISEI of students’
parents in the classroom, the median ISCED and the share of children with a migration
background. Due to the multiple-tier structure of secondary schooling in Germany, we further
control for the type of secondary school in all analyses. We differentiate between lower
(‘Hauptschule’), intermediate (‘Realschule’) and upper secondary schools (‘Gymnasium’) as
well as middle schools (‘Mittelschule’; ‘Sekundarschule’) and comprehensive schools
(‘Gesamtschule’). Furthermore, we control for the German federal state in all analyses (cf.
Table 1).

Data Analysis
We begin our analysis by looking at potential differences between teachers with and without a
migration background. To this means, we provide descriptive statistics on various teacher
variables and results from bivariate regression models of these characteristics on teachers’
migration background. In our main analyses, we look at students’ achievements and grades
depending on their migration background and on the migration background of their teachers.
To account for the hierarchical structure of this data, with students nested in classrooms
respectively in teachers, we estimate weighted two-level random intercept models.5 All models
are estimated using the provided weights. As an additional robustness check, we further
estimate teacher fixed effects regression models (see robustness checks section).
To deal with item missing values, we employ multiple imputation using chained
equations to generate m=25 complete datasets (Azuret al., 2011; Rubin, 1987). Subsequently,
we dropped cases with missing values on the given dependent variable (von Hippel, 2007),
which is why the number of observations differs slightly between the models on achievement
test scores and grade.6

4

Cultural activities are, e.g., going to a museum, concert, opera, ballet or theatre. Overall, the factor score consists
of five items and has an eigenvalue of 2.09 (Cronbach alpha=0.88).
5

We also estimated random coefficient models including a random coefficient for students’ migration background.
However, the effect of students’ migration background did not vary over teachers and the major results remained
unchanged (cf. Appendix A1). Thus, we choose to report findings of the random intercept models.

Results
Characteristics of Migrant Teachers
Since little is known about whether migrant teachers differ from non-migrant teachers, we begin
with a brief description of some of their characteristics before turning to our core question
regarding their influence on students’ learning outcomes.
Comparing teachers with and without a migration background in our sample, we mostly
find rather small and insignificant differences (Table 2). On average, the former are more often
female, younger, show less job experience, and participate less often in formal advanced
trainings than teachers without a migration background. We find no significant differences
between teachers with and without a migration background regarding the social background of
their parents.7 Teachers with a migration background teach classrooms with a slightly higher
share of migrant students and a slightly lower mean ISCED of students’ parents. Furthermore,
they more often teach in middle or intermediate secondary schools and less often in upper
secondary schools.
--- Table 2 about here ---

Bivariate Findings on Students’ Achievements and Grades
In our analyses, we are interested in four different groups. These are students with or without
migration background (MigStud/noMigStud), taught either by a migrant or by a non-migrant
teacher (MigTeach/noMigTeach). First, we estimate weighted multilevel regression models to
analyse whether the four different groups differ in their mean values on any of the dependent
variables. Results are plotted in figure 1. Findings for the three test scores (reading, listening,
orthography) and the grades show a rather similar pattern. We have two core findings: First, we
can replicate the well-known finding that migrant students perform worse than students with
no migration background – independent of the migration status of the teacher. More interesting
for our research question, however, is the second finding. Both migrant and non-migrant
students tend to achieve lower test scores and receive lower grades if taught by a migrant
teacher. These differences are not statistically significant among non-migrant students. Among

7

In this respect teachers do not differ from university students: The Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung
(2016: 334) using data from the NEPS/SC5 descriptively also find no difference between students with and without
migration background regarding their parental education or parental HISEI.
9

migrant students, however, these purely descriptive differences suggest that migrant students
may perform worse when being taught by a migrant teacher.
--- Figure 1 about here ---

Multivariate Findings on Students’ Achievements and Grades
The bivariate results shed first light on whether it is reasonable to expect that migrant teachers
are an effective means to tackle ethnic educational inequality. So far, the analyses do not support
this idea. However, selection effects might lead to a spurious relationship between teachers’
migration background and the outcomes of interest. This might for example be the case if
migrant teachers are assigned to classrooms that show lower academic achievements or if
migrant teachers are disproportionally employed in lower secondary schools. If this is the case,
the negative association of teachers’ migration background and students’ test scores and grades
found in figure 1 might be incorrectly attributed to teachers’ migration background. Ideally,
longitudinal data would allow for ruling out these sorts of selection problems. Unfortunately,
there is no longitudinal data available that provides information on students’ and teachers’
migration background in sufficient numbers for Germany so far. Thus, we choose to tackle the
selection problem by including an extensive set of variables typically related to student’s school
achievements (see ‘Control variables’ in Table 1). These include, for example, the
socioeconomic background and cultural capital of the students. Moreover, we control for a
number of teacher and classroom characteristics such as teacher’s gender and age as well as the
type of secondary school, the mean socioeconomic background of the students in the classroom,
and the share of students with a migration background in the classroom. In our multivariate
analyses, we hold all these student, teacher and classroom characteristics constant to mitigate
bias due to a non-random teacher assignment to classrooms. Table 3 gives our estimates for
students’ and teachers’ migration status as well as the interaction effect between them.
Looking at the results of the achievement tests, we again find that migrant students
perform worse on the reading and listening comprehension test than non-migrant students,
independent of teachers’ migration status. We do not find any ethnic penalty on the
orthographic test once we control for background characteristics. However, ethnic penalties
have already been weakest in this domain even without controlling for background
characteristics (cf. Figure 1; Köller, et al., 2010: 220). Moreover, concerning our research
question, we now find that the negative association between teachers’ migration background
and students’ test scores is largely reduced to 3 to 7 points for non-migrant students. None of
10

these differences is significant. We find the same pattern for migrant students. The test score
differences depending on the migration status of the teacher are largely reduced to 13 to 18
points after controlling for background characteristics.8 However, for the reading
comprehension, the negative association with teachers’ migration status remains significant
even after controlling for a broad range of background characteristics. This is not the case for
scores in listening comprehension and orthographic tests. Finally, we look at the interaction
effects, which tell us whether the penalty of students with a migration background, compared
to students without a migration background, might be reduced in classrooms with a migrant
teacher. This is not the case. The negative interaction terms show that the ethnic disadvantage
in the achievement tests is even slightly stronger in classrooms taught by a migrant teacher.
However, none of the interaction terms is statistically significant.
Looking at student’s grades, we do not find any ethnic penalty once achievement test
scores and all background characteristics are controlled for. Although we find a small negligible
non-significant negative association of teachers’ migration background and non-migrant
students’ grades, we would argue that neither students’ nor teachers’ migration status affects
grading once competences and background characteristics are controlled for.
--- Table 3 about here ---

Robustness Checks
Our results could be misleading (1) due to selection effects or (2) because the expected effects
only hold in subgroups of the population (i.e. effect heterogeneity). In this section, we report
several checks to verify the robustness of our findings.
(1) In table 4, we present estimates from teacher fixed effects models. They yield the
advantage that all teacher, classroom and school characteristics, even unobserved ones, are
controlled. Thus, there is no bias possible due to any factor that is common among students
taught by the same teacher (e.g. social background of the teacher, classroom composition,
school quality). This is of course also the case for teachers’ migration background, which makes
it impossible to estimate the main effect of teachers’ migration background. However, it is
possible to estimate the interaction term between teachers’ and students’ migration status. As

8

To assess the disadvantage of migrant students taught by a migrant teacher, the main effect of migrant teachers
and the interaction term must be added. For the reading comprehension test, this equals (-6.95) + (-8.90) = -15.85.
Testing the significance of this linear combination (not reported here) reveals that it is significant at p ≤ 0.05 for
the reading comprehension test only.
11

before, this term shows whether the ethnic educational penalty of migrant students is reduced
in classrooms taught by a migrant teacher; i.e. positive interaction effects would lend support
to the notion that migrant students benefit from migrant teachers. However, our results show
that this is not the case. All interaction effects are negative or close to zero, and none of them
is statistically significant.
--- Table 4 about here --(2) It may be the case that only certain subgroups of migrant students benefit from
migrant teachers. Above, we argued that first-generation migrant students may face greater
challenges in learning German and that migrant teachers’ capacities to support language
learning and integration may be especially helpful for this subgroup. Moreover, several studies
from the U.S. suggested that ethnic minority children living in disadvantaged settings profit
most from racially congruent teachers (e.g. Dee, 2004; Goldhaber et al., 2015; Marx et al.,
2009). We tested both of these conjectures in separate subsample analyses. We ran regression
models including only first-generation immigrant students (Table 5) as well as regression
models on low SES students, who we defined as students belonging to the first quartile (Table
6). We find that first-generation migrant students and students from low SES families indeed
perform worst on the achievement tests. However, results concerning the migration background
of the teacher are in line with our previous findings, not showing any (significant) positive
association between teachers’ migration background and (migrant) students’ achievements or
grades.

Summary and Conclusion
The claim of increasing ethnic diversity among teachers implicitly assumes that a higher share
of migrant teachers would be beneficial in several respects – for society as a whole, for teaching
in schools, and in particular for migrant student’s educational success. For Europe, researchbased empirical support for the expected benefits for (migrant) students taught by migrant
teachers is rather scarce. In this paper, we made an attempt to overcome this gap for Germany.
First, we compared migrant teachers and non-migrant teachers along several characteristics that
12

are potentially important for student learning. Among other things, we find that migrant
teachers have less job experience and participate less often in formal advanced trainings.
However, differences are rather small and mostly insignificant. Second, and more importantly,
we analysed whether migrant students benefit from being taught by a migrant teacher in terms
of their competence scores in reading, listening and orthography, as well as their grades in
German. Our results suggest this is not the case for any of the outcomes we observe. Contrary
to expectations, reading comprehension is lower for migrant students when having a migrant
teacher. Listening comprehension and orthography are not affected by the presence of a migrant
teacher in our data, and neither are grades. The coefficients point in the opposite direction as
well, but they are not statistically significant.
In light of these insignificant differences, one may wonder if we are just lacking
statistical power to detect positive effects. To test this potential objection, we examined the
upper bounds of the 95 percent confidence intervals. Looking at the results of the listening
comprehension and orthography test scores (table 3), we can be confident with a probability of
95 percent that any possible positive effect is not larger than 2.6 respectively 0.6 points.9 Thus,
we can rule out any substantive positive association between migrant students’ test scores and
being taught by a migrant teacher. For grading, however, the upper bound is 0.18 (0 + 1.96 *
0.09), which is a substantively important difference. Hence, we cannot rule out grading
advantages (net of actual performance disadvantages) for migrant students.
Some important shortcomings of this study should not go unmentioned. First, we still
work with a relatively low number of migrant teachers in our sample (n=62). Because of this
low case number and because we do not know their countries of origin, we cannot test whether
students may profit particularly if they share the same country of origin with the teacher.
Second, the cross-sectional nature of our data is problematic, as we can only observe a snapshot
of student’s performance, not knowing if they had migrant teachers in the preceding school
career. Our results may therefore be affected by cumulative effects arising from the number of
migrant teachers in the previous educational career as well as the (length) of exposure in
particular subjects in school. In addition, we cannot assess potential lagged effects of migrant
teachers, or the possibility that migrant teachers have important implications at other stages in
the educational career, such as the transition from primary to secondary school. Third, our
results are limited to the subject of German and to two outcomes, namely competence scores

9

These upper bounds of the 95 percent confidence intervals are estimated as -13.26 (coefficient) + 1.96 * 8.07
(standard error) = 2.56 for the listening comprehension and as -17.81 + 1.96 * 9.38 = 0.58 for the orthography test.

and grades. Further research is required to extend these analyses to other domains such as math
or sciences as well as to other outcomes. For example, it remains an open question whether
migrant teachers have an influence on students’ self-perception or self-confidence.
Unfortunately, data limitations have so far precluded an analysis of most of these issues.
Despite these limitations, our results suggest that recruiting more migrant teachers will
hardly reduce ethnic disadvantages in educational outcomes. This should be born in mind
regarding the often-heard assumption that increasing the presence of migrant teachers is an
effective means to considerably reduce ethnic penalties. So, why may the popular claim not
hold true? Two explanations seem plausible: First, migrant teachers are assumed to possess
intercultural competencies per se; however, this might not be the case. Students’ success in
school much rather depends on the quality of the teaching, not on the socio-demographic
characteristics of the teaching workforce (for similar findings on the lack of teachers’ gender
effects, see Neugebauer et al., 2011). If having specific qualifications to deal with migrant
students’ needs is beneficial for migrant students, non-migrant teachers should be able to attain
these skills as well. Second, both migrant teachers and students are a very heterogeneous group
in terms of country of origin. Hence, the assumed characteristics of migrant teachers such as
multi-language or cultural understanding might be very limited, e.g. to migrant students of the
same country of origin. Due to heterogeneity of teachers and students, ‘beneficial matches’
would be a rare case. Finally, let’s assume that migrant students actually benefit from being
taught by migrant teachers In consequence, it would be optimal to segregate students into
(mainly) migrant and non-migrant classrooms taught by (mainly) migrant resp. non-migrant
teachers. This would run counter to the attempts to increase diversity and de-segregate schools
or society as a whole.

Notes: Estimates from multilevel mixed linear models with multiply imputed (m=25), clustered and weighted data; all models control for type of school, federal state, highest ISEI
of students’ parents, highest ISCED of students’ parents, number of books in students’ home, cultural activities of students, age of students, age square of students, gender of
students, age of teacher, gender of teacher, mean ISEI in classroom, median ISCED in classroom, and share of students with migration background in classroom.
a) Additional controls: reading comprehension, listening comprehension, orthography; b) To assess the disadvantage of migrant students taught by a migrant teacher compared
to migrant students taught by a non-migrant teacher, we have to combine the main effect of the teacher’s migration background and the interaction effect. For the outcome reading
comprehension, this linear combination equals -15.85 (S.E. 6.53), which is significant at (p≤0.05). For the other outcomes, linear combinations are not significant: listening
comprehension = -13.26 (S.E. 8.07); orthography = -17.81(S.E 9.38); grades = 0.00 (S.E. 0.09).

Notes: Estimates from multilevel mixed linear models with multiply imputed (m=25), clustered and weighted data;
all models control for federal state.
a) To assess the disadvantage of migrant students taught by a migrant teacher compared to migrant students
taught by a non-migrant teacher, we have to combine the main effect of the migration background of the teacher
and the interaction effect. In the case of reading comprehension, this linear combination equals -15.85. Testing
the significance of this linear combination reveals a significant disadvantage at (p≤0.05) for migrant students
taught by migrant teachers; b) additional controls: reading comprehension, listening comprehension,
orthography.
+ P≤0.10; *P≤0.05; **P≤0.01; ***P≤0.001.
