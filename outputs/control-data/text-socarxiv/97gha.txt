Abstract
This article presents the quantitative findings from a mixed-method study of perceptions of crime in
inner Sydney. A survey was deployed via Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) on a
randomly selected sample of the inner Sydney population (n=409). We find that less than half of the
participants worry about crime but that a sizable minority (13%) indicated that they have some worry
about a category of crime every week of the year or more. Building on a recent conceptual advance
Gray et al. 2011), we differentiate between functional and dysfunctional fear of crime. We find that
greater direct and indirect experience of victimization, believing one’s neighbourhood to be
disorderly, and believing that collective efficacy is low all predict moving up the scale from no worry,
to functional fear, to increasingly frequent dysfunctional fear. The findings suggest gender and age are
largely unrelated to worry about crime, controlling for perceptions of community disorder,
perceptions of collective efficacy, direct victimisation experience and indirect victimisation
experience. We conclude with some thoughts on the role of environmental cues in shifting people’s
functional response to perceived risk to dysfunctional patterning of emotions in people’s daily lives.

Key words
Fear of crime; mixed-methods; public insecurity, collective efficacy, quality of life.

Introduction
Since the ‘discovery’ of fear of crime, reducing worry about crime has proven a significant
issue for policy makers, police and academics (Lee & Mythen, 2018). Despite falling levels of
reported crime in many western nations in recent decades (Farrell, Tilley, & Tseloni, 2014), levels of
fear of crime have tended to decrease at slower rates – if indeed they have reduced at all (Lee, 2007;
Simon, 2018). This is concerning because worries and anxieties associated with the fear of crime can
erode quality of life and well-being (Jackson & Stafford, 2009; Stafford, Chandola, & Marmot, 2007),
motivate costly but not always beneficial precautions and restrict movement (Lee, 2007), encourage
‘flight’ from deprived areas, harm social trust, inter-group relations and the capacity of communities
to exercise social control (Hale, 1996; Jackson & Stafford, 2009), and contribute to a range of
‘negative cognitive (pessimism, problem exaggeration) and affective consequences (emotional
discomfort, depression)’ (Gray, Jackson, & Farrall, 2011, p. 77). At the same time, fear of crime can
shape the machinations of the justice system, the way we treat crime, and those we criminalise (Lee,
2007). Considerable resources are allocated to crime prevention strategies in an effort to reduce fear
of crime (Sakip, Joharia, & Sallehb, 2012), and public institutions such as the police (and all levels of
government) develop Key Performance Indicators based on reducing such fears (Lee, 2007). Efforts
to reduce worry about crime have increasingly fallen upon local government in Australia, the United
Kingdom and other Western nation states (eg. UK Government 2015). Yet, there has been a good deal
of contention on how fear of crime has been measured and whether poor survey and research methods
have resulted in an overestimation of levels of fear of crime (Farrall, Bannister, Ditton, & Gilchrist,
1997; Gray, Jackson, & Farrall, 2008a; Gray et al., 2011; Jackson & Gray, 2010).
As a methodological response, scholars have recently attempted to more accurately calibrate
measures of fear of crime and better define and separate its key concepts and components (Gray et al.,
2011). This includes a more granular assessment of worry through measures of frequency of worry
and intensity of worry (Gray et al., 2011). Importantly to the current study, researchers have also
sought to establish whether respondents’ fears are rendered ‘functional’ or ‘dysfunctional’ depending
on their behavioural and quality of life outcomes (Jackson & Gray, 2010). Here we draw on Jackson
and Gray’s (2010) model of functional fear to differentiate between diffuse, affective representation
of personal crime risk and the lived experience of anxiety, worry and fear about being victimized in
one’s daily life. The aim is to better understand the variables likely to predict higher levels and
intensity of worry, and importantly, to draw conclusions about how that worry can be managed
functionally.
We begin with a critical overview of research into perceptions of crime. We then discuss
more recent conceptual and methodological innovations and draw on these for the present study
conducted in inner Sydney. We discuss our own methods and present the results and analysis of the
research. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of this research to policies of fear
reduction.

Criticism of Fear of Crime Research
Criticism of fear of crime research has long been a feature of the field, crystalising over the years in
authoritative periodic literature reviews (DuBow, McCabe, & Kaplan, 1979; Ferraro & LaGrange,
1987; Hale, 1996) and compendiums (Ditton & Farrall, 2000; Farrall, Jackson, & Gray, 2009; Lee &
Farrall, 2009; Lee & Mythen, 2018). A surprising amount of the prodigious body of research into fear
of crime contests the theoretical and methodological validity and reliability of standard survey tools.
Researchers continue to challenge ‘misspecifications’, both theoretical and empirical, commonly
involved in such research (Ditton & Farrall, 2000; Ferraro & LaGrange, 1987; Garofalo & Laub,
1978; Gray et al., 2011; Hale, 1996). Theoretical under-specification has limited the depth and breadth

2

of definitions and explanations of fear of crime, leaving us with a ‘contested and congested concept’
(Gray, Jackson, & Farrall, 2008b, p. 2) see also (Loader, Girling, & Sparks, 2000). At the same time,
methodological limitations pose serious implications for the validity of the body of knowledge that
public policy relies upon (Bernard, 1992; Farrall & Gadd, 2004; Gray et al., 2008a; Lee, 1999, 2001,
2007; Skogan, 1981). Potentially most troubling is that the technical problems that have dogged this
field of inquiry (Ditton & Farrall, 2000; Farrall et al., 2009; Gray et al., 2008a; Hale, 1996; Lee, 2007;
Lee & Farrall, 2009; Warr, 2000) have impeded the ability to make useful generalisations (Ferraro &
LaGrange, 1987).
Farrall et al. (2009) have shown across a range of measures that many surveys over-estimate
the level of everyday worry about victimization, giving us sub-optimal data from which good
perceptions of safety policy interventions can be built. For example, most surveys do not tell us about
the frequency of respondent’s fearful or concerned episodes, nor where these episodes take place.
Many questions that are regularly used in surveys, such as ‘how safe do you feel walking alone in
your neighbourhood after dark?’ and ‘how worried are you about being attacked in the street by a
stranger after dark?’, seem to elicit frightening images of people, places and events in respondent’s
minds, encouraging expressions of fear of crime, often irrespective of (a) whether they ever actually
find themselves in such situations and (b) whether they ever actually feel worried and/or fearful (Gray
et al., 2008a). This has the potential to exaggerate the expressed concerns that surveys seek to
understand or report upon (Hollway & Jefferson, 2000; Lee, 2007).
There remains an uneasy methodological compromise between the continued use of survey
questions that provide a longitudinal perspective on fear of crime and recent methods that provide
more nuanced responses to questions about fear of crime (Lee & Ellis, 2018). Ditton, Farrall,
Bannister, & Gilchrist’s (2000) analysis of responses to the question – ‘Could you tell me how
worried you are about having your home broken into and something stolen?’, determined that out of a
sample of over 1,000 interviewees, only one was ‘really’ worried, with a caution that how many
respondents could be deemed ‘worriers’ was a matter of methodological choice, rather than a matter
of fact (Ditton et al., 2000). Ditton et al. (2000) also found that almost a third of a sample responded
differently to an almost identical version of the same question within half an hour (Ditton et al.,
2000). Their suggestion, however, was not to complain about ‘response inconsistency’ but rather to be
more methodologically innovative and give respondents points for worry, thereby creating a ‘worry as
a continuum’, rather than as a dichotomous variable (Ditton et al., 2000). In short, to attempt to
represent worry as the complex phenomenon that it is. They emphasise that worry is a matter of
degree that represents not a single policy problem of ‘fear’, but different degrees of a problem, and
importantly, probably different problems altogether (Ditton et al., 2000).
In conjunction with these methodological considerations is the ongoing debate over ‘fear’ of
crime vocabulary. Ditton et al. (2000) found in over a decade of fear of crime research that ‘fear’
about the prospect of, and the reality of criminal victimisation, is secondary to ‘anger’ about such
fears (Ditton et al., 2000) (see also Farrall, 2004). This raises the related concern of the predominance
of quantitative research in this field at the expense of more targeted qualitative research (Ditton et al.,
2000; Lee & Ellis, 2018). Fear of crime is researched chiefly by survey instruments, which are often
uncritically ‘filched’ from other such surveys. While ‘fear of crime’ may affect quality of life, to what
extent and why, within certain populations, needs to be investigated further to go beyond ‘global’
summaries (Gray et al., 2008a, p. 364) and provide more nuanced data to better serve as the basis for
tailored fear of crime interventions.

The current study, and trends in fear of crime research
This study employs many of the key recent advances in both the conceptualisation of fear of crime
and the methodologies used to assess it. In particular, it draws on the call from Ditton et al (2000) for

3

a more granular assessment of worry through measures of frequency and intensity, whether
respondents’ fears are ‘functional’ or ‘dysfunctional’, and the relationship between measures of
collective efficacy, neighbourhood disorder, and informal social control. In this section we explain
these concepts further.
Gray et al (2008a) have argued for the inclusion of ‘everyday emotions’ into such research,
while Gerber, Hirtenlehner and Jackson (2010) have differentiated between the affective, cognitive
and conative when evaluating personal attitudes towards crime:
“Affective relates to the emotional reaction to crime, cognitive refers to personal risk
assessment, and conative is concerned with protective and avoidance behaviour. Feelings,
thoughts and behaviours are also assumed to interact. For example, someone may assess a
situation as dangerous (cognitive aspect) when coping skills are judged as inadequate; they
may then experience an emotion of fear regarding the situation (affective aspect), and they
may then react in a defensive manner (conative aspect).” (Gerber et al., 2010: 143)
In response to the lack of instruments that capture the cognitive and behavioural processes
involved in the construction of emotional responses to fear of crime Gray et al. (2011) developed a
more comprehensive understanding of how crime-emotions affect the ways ‘individuals navigate their
social worlds and respond to external stimuli’ (Gray et al., 2011, p. 76). Through an ordinal measure
they locate emotional and behavioural responses to crime on a scale, disentangling ‘emotional and
behavioural corollaries of crime fears’ at an aggregate level (Gray et al., 2011, p. 90); providing
opportunities to understand on a large-scale, ‘complex patterns of emotional and behavioural
responses to public insecurity’ (Gray et al., 2011, p. 90).

Defining Feelings
Gray et al’s (2011) definition of fear of crime integrates two conceptual developments. The first
distinguishes between ‘everyday worries’ about crime and more ‘diffuse anxieties’ about crime (Gray
et al., 2011, p. 90) see also (Farrall et al., 2009). ‘Worry’ involves ‘concrete mental events of
concern’; while ‘anxiety’ involves ‘a more diffuse mental state’ (Gray et al., 2011, p. 76) – a state
that Hough has described as ‘a rumbling state of unease’ (Hough, 2004, p. 174). Through measuring
intensity of crime fears and their frequency, Gray et al. (Gray et al., 2011) attempted to isolate
memorable events of everyday worries from ‘emotionally-tinged’ attitudes towards risk or ‘futureoriented anxiety’ expressed through being more troubled generally by the risks of being victimised
(Gray et al., 2011, p. 76). A ‘raw count’ of worrying events is counted over a narrow timeframe to
minimise telescoping and generate more accurate recall ‘of situated and concrete moments of
concern’ (Gray et al., 2011, p. 77). Gray et al. (2011) argue that the frequency questions capture
‘experiences’ of worry about crime, while standard questions are more likely to measure aspects of
anxiety – including broader attitudes or judgements about crime (Gray et al., 2011). Combining the
standard (intensity) and frequency measures differentiated between the ‘unworried’ – who reported
being ‘unworried’ on both measures, and the ‘worried’, who worried on the standard question but
who when asked the frequency question could not recall a recent event of worry (Gray et al., 2011).
The ‘unworried’ were the most common grouping on both measures, and the most interesting
category was the ‘anxious’, who said they were worried about a particular crime but were unable to
recall a recent episode of worry (Gray et al., 2011). These ‘anxious’ individuals ‘described an
emotional experience that was more diffuse and more intangible than any memorable or conspicuous
event’ (Gray et al., 2011, p. 77).

4

Defining functions
The second conceptual development is functional fear (Jackson & Gray, 2010; Warr, 2000), which
distinguishes between the ‘functional’ and ‘dysfunctional’ effects of everyday worries and anxieties
(Gray et al., 2008a, 2011). Consistent with the ways in which worry can positively motivate, Jackson
and Gray (2010) found that a significant minority of individuals who said they were worried about
crime also reported that they took precautions–-that made them feel safer–-and that neither their
precautions nor their worries about crime affected their quality of life (Gray et al., 2011). In such
contexts, ‘fear’ might better viewed as a functional defence against crime because it motivates
socially beneficial behaviour – something that allows individuals to exert control over perceived risks
and to stimulate action, rather than an inherently negative feeling that erodes quality-of-life. Worry
can thus serve a motivational and precautionary function, helping to prepare for threat by prompting
‘adaptive vigilance and routine precaution’ (Gray et al., 2011, p. 77).
Yet, worry is certainly not always functional. Among the features of ‘high’ worriers were
more frequent episodes of worry (at least daily); greater difficulty in stopping worrying; rebounding
worries; and mood disturbance and perceived impairment in everyday functioning (Gray et al., 2011).
In their research, ‘high’ worriers also reported greater indecision and doubt when worrying, and they
were more likely to perceive worry as having a negative effect on their health (Gray et al., 2011). So
Gray et al. (2011) then combined these distinctions into an ordinal scale that moves from the
‘unworried’, to low-level motivating emotions, to frequent and dysfunctional worry about crime:
•
•
•
•
•

Unworried
Anxious – functional
Worried – functional
Anxious – dysfunctional
Worried – dysfunctional

Gray et al.’s 2011 study found that 27% of the sample fell into the dysfunctional category (compared
to 8% in the functional category) (Gray et al., 2011). The odds ratio for ‘dysfunctionally worried’ was
considerably larger for respondents who had been victimised over the past 12 months (Gray et al.,
2011).
The present study makes use of the ‘everyday worries’ development by using targeted
questions that tap into this ‘experiential fear’ rather than more diverse anxieties (Jackson & Kuha,
2016). In terms of concrete questions to more accurately measure fear of crime, and even the
precautionary benefits of fear of crime, we follow Gray et al. (2008a) model for a series of questions
that:
1. Measure worry about crime using a standard intensity measure and frequency
2. Include supplementary questions that gauge the precautions taken by the worried
respondents, and
3. Measure the impact that taking these precautions had on the respondents’ quality of life and
feelings of safety.

Fear of crime and victimisation
The evidence on the role of previous victimisation in fear of crime is still mixed although many
studies have drawn a strong association (Bernard, 1992; Hale, 1996; Lee, 2015; Russo & Roccato,
2010). Moreover, there are questions about how differences in perceptions of crime victimisation and
risk correlate with inter-individual variations in socio-demographic characteristics, routine activities,

5

and contextual factors and judgement of risk (Hale, 1996). Jackson and Stafford (2009) suggest that
the association between prospective fear of crime and mental health problems contributes to a
‘recursive’ model of fear and health, with the mental health problems leading to a further increase in
fear of crime (Jackson & Stafford, 2009). Also, that ‘victimisation experience is related to
dysfunctional worry but not with functional worry, and that social concerns (about neighbourhood
disorder and levels of collective efficacy) are associated with both functional and dysfunctional worry
about crime’ (Jackson & Gray, 2010, p. 2). Hale (1996) suggests that while ‘neutralisation techniques’
employed by some victims of crime motivate them to become more cautious or employ strategies to
prevent further victimisation, that the related variable of ‘indirect victimisation’ actually allows ‘one’s
imagination full scope without perhaps the same urgency to find a coping strategy’ (Hale, 1996, p.
105). This may explain why the indirectly victimised sometimes report higher levels of fear of crime
than those actually victimised. The current study includes questions on victimisation in an effort to
assess its influence on our sample.

Informal social control and collective efficacy
The formal agents of social control such as public police are not ‘omnipresent’ within or across
communities and neighbourhoods (Sargeant, 2017). The control of the streets and neighbourhoods is
much more a function of residents and community members, in conjunction with police, security
guards and other formal agents of social control (Sargeant, 2017).
The related concept of ‘collective efficacy’ has emerged from this interest in community
dynamics, circumstances and crime (Sampson 2004; Wikes et al. 2018). According to Sampson
(2004), neighbourhood collective efficacy ‘captures the link between cohesion — especially working
trust — and shared expectations for action’ (Sampson 2004, p. 108). More specifically, ‘a
neighbourhood’s efficacy exists relative to specific tasks such as maintaining public order. The key
causal mechanism in collective efficacy theory is social control enacted under conditions of social
trust’ (Sampson 2004 p 108). Thus, collective efficacy is the neighbourhood’s ability to maintain
order in public spaces such as streets, footpaths and parks (Vold, Bernard, & Snipes, 2002, pp. 131-2),
which raises issues associated with shared expectation and mutual engagement by local residents.
Drawing on Sampson’s model we have included a range of such measures here (Sampson 2004:
Sampson & Groves 1989).

The Study
Method
A total of 409 respondents (n=409) residing in the City of Sydney Local Government Area were
randomly selected for this study. Data were collected using Computer Assisted Telephone Interview
(CATI). Each interview was approximately 10 to 15 minutes in length. The survey is a refinement of a
pilot survey conducted in 2015 in inner-city Sydney, co-funded by the City of Sydney and the
University of Sydney. The findings in this article are from the second sweep of the survey, conducted
in 2016, and commissioned by the City of Sydney. The study included a qualitative component – 13
focus groups conducted across the City of Sydney Local Government Area. Significantly these groups
included a cross section of the community, and notably several hard-to-reach or vulnerable
community groups - Cantonese speakers, Serbian speakers, LGBTI young people and international
students. We did not have space in this article to include these more detailed and nuanced perspectives
on fear of crime (see Lee et al., 2020).
Seven key dimensions from the contemporary perceptions of crime research discussed above are
6

drawn upon in this survey:
1. Demographic data aimed specifically to identify variables in perceived vulnerability – age,
gender, sexuality, ethnicity
2. The relative seriousness of various kinds of neighbourhood disorder
3. Level of collective efficacy at the neighbourhood level (how supportive the local community
was perceived to be and how trustworthy neighbours were)
4. Perceived level of informal social control in the area (how reliable were
neighbours/community in dealing with the possibility of offending behaviours)
5. How worried respondents were about being a victim of a range of offences (burglary,
harassment in public, being sexually assaulted in public, and being physically assaulted in
public) and how frequently in the past year respondents (if at all) had worried about the
possibility of being victimised
6. Avoidance behaviours and whether such behaviour negatively affected quality of life; this
allowed us to test whether fear was functional or dysfunctional in relation to behavioural
patterns
7. Past victimisation.

Sample
The data was weighted on the basis of age and gender to reflect the population of the City of Sydney
using 2011 Australian Bureau of Statistics Census of Population and Housing data. The demographic

Measures and descriptive statistics
Table 1 provides the wording and descriptive statistics of the key measures. Respondents were asked
whether or not in the last year they had worried about their home being burgled, being harassed in
public, being physically assaulted in public or being sexually assaulted in public. If respondents said
‘yes’, they were then asked the number of times they had felt like this in the last year. A total of 29%
reported having felt worried about being burgled, 27% about being harassed, 19% about being
physically assaulted, and 7% about being sexual assaulted. Overall, 199 of 409 (49%) reported
worrying about one or more of the four in the past year. There was a sizable minority (13%) who
indicated that they have some worry about a category of crime every week of the year or more.
Indeed, two respondents suggested they worry 365 days of the year.

Figure 1 breaks down worry about each of the four crime types by gender. While males (31%)
are slightly more likely than females (26%) to worry about having their home burgled, women (32%)
worried more about being harassed in public than men (23%) and being sexually assaulted (females
13%, males 1%). There were no significant gender differences in levels of worry about being
assaulted in public with 20% of males and 19% of females expressing being worried about this in the
past 12 months.
Figure 1. Percentage of respondents feeling worried and not worried in the past 12 months by gender
and crime type.

Figure 2 provides a breakdown of whether someone had indicated worrying about at least one
crime type by age. While the younger age group were more likely to express worry, perhaps because
they are more likely to be in public places at night, there was little overall variation. A small sample
size in the 70+ category should exclude it.

Figure 2. Percentage worried and not worried in the past 12 months by age group.

Respondents were asked how often (if at all) they had taken a range of precautions against
crime in their local area in the past year (Table 1). Avoiding certain streets/areas at night (42%)
proved the most common avoidance strategy, and avoiding public transport at night (18%) the second
most common avoidance strategy. Respondents were also asked whether they had ever enhanced
security in and/or around their home specifically as a precaution against crime. A total of 98 of 409
respondents (23.9%) suggested that they had, with 38 (9.4%) having done so in the past year. Those
who had taken one of the crime avoidance precautions, or had enhanced their home security in the
past year were asked the extent to which they felt safer as a consequence. Of the 287 (70%) who had
taken some form of precaution, 21 (7%) suggested they felt ‘Not at all’ safer, 46 (16%) ‘A little’ safer,
69 (24%) ‘Moderately’ safer, 64 (23%) ‘Quite a bit’ safer, 57 (20%) ‘Very much’ safer with a further
27 (10%) unsure.
Respondents were also asked about the extent to which their quality of life had been affected
by worry about becoming a victim of crime (asked of all respondents) or precautions they had taken
against crime (asked of those who took precautions), with responses shown in Table 2. Of those that
worried 52% said this worry did not negatively affect their quality of life. Similarly, of those that took
precautions some 46% thought such precautions did not negatively affect their quality of life. What
this indicates is that we need to be mindful in thinking worry about crime is always a negative issue.
This is taken up in the results section on functional fear.

Respondents were asked whether they, or someone they knew had been a victim of one of the
four forms of crime in the past year. While a small number of respondents had been victimised over
the past year, almost 25% reported being insulted or harassed in public (Table 1). Respondents were
also asked whether they felt that six type of neighbourhood problem were a major problem, minor
problem or not a problem in their area. ‘Noisy/rowdy behaviour on the street’ topped the list with
64% in total seeing it as problem in their area and 20% of these reporting that it was a major problem
(Table 1). Finally, respondents were asked three questions that aimed to measure collective efficacy
and three other questions designed to measure social control in their area. While responses to these
questions indicate generally favourable views of local community and local neighbourhood,
respondents were less likely to agree that ‘if children/young people are causing trouble local people
will tell them off’ and that the neighbourhood is ‘close-knit’ (Table 1).

Results
Our focus here is on functional and dysfunctional fear of crime. We (a) test whether Jackson & Gray’s
(2010) and Gray et al.’s (2011) categorization holds with the Sydney data and (b) examine key
predictors with a particular focus on gender, age, direct and indirect victimization experience,
perceived disorder and perceived collective efficacy.
As described earlier, functional fear can be thought of as a natural, functional defence against
crime involving straightforward adaptations and behaviours—‘a potentially socially beneficial activity
that allows individuals to exert control over perceived risks, encouraging them to behave in a
responsible fashion’ (Gray et al., 2011, p. 78). It may even be pro-social in nature with the capacity to
activate group rather than individual responses to worry. Functional fear is when people report being
worried about crime (49% of respondents), take some kind of precaution against crime (68% of
respondents), feel safer as a result of their precautions (64% of respondents) and do not think their
quality of life is reduced by their worry about crime (85% of respondents) or precautions against
crime (67% of respondents). Among those respondents who said that they had worried at least once
about victimisation, 44% fell into this functional fear category. That is, they took precautions, these
precautions made them felt safer as a result, and their worry and precautions did not affect their
quality of life in a negative way.
Combining information about the frequency and functionality of worry reveals an interesting
picture (Table 3). We can see that 211 (52%) respondents reported that they were not worried about
crime. Functional fear was evident among 26 (6%) respondents, and of the remaining respondents
who reported dysfunctional fear, 86 (21%) had worried once a month or less, 39 (10%) had worried
between once a week and just less than once a month, and 47 (12%) had worried more than once a
week. This demonstrates quite a close fit to the results recorded by Gray et al (2011).

The final step of analysis is to assess the extent to which gender, age, direct victimisation
experience, indirect victimisation experience, perceptions of community disorder and perceptions of
collective efficacy predict category membership. We fit a multinomial logistic regression model,
using ‘unworried’ as the reference category. Table 4 presents the results of this model. As
demonstrated, gender and age are unrelated to worry about crime, controlling for perceptions of
community disorder, perceptions of collective efficacy, direct victimisation experience and indirect
victimisation experience (the exception being that females are more likely than males to fall into the
‘dysfunctional worry, more than once a week’ category, as opposed to the ‘unworried worry’
category). An odds ratio of 2.59 means that the odds of being in the ‘dysfunctional worry, more than
once a week’ category compared to the ‘unworried worry’ category are 159% more than they are for
females compared to males.

The best way of describing a fitted multinomial logistic model is in terms of fitted response
probabilities. Figure 3 shows the fitted probabilities over the range of perceived community disorder
(adjusting for the other variables in the model, fixing their levels at their mean). As perceived disorder
increases, so the predicted probability of being ‘unworried’ reduces (from 0.6 and 0.3), the predicted
probability of being in the ‘dysfunctional worry, between once a week and just less than once a
month’ category increases (from 0.04 to 0.35), and the predicted probability of being in the
‘dysfunctional worry, more than once a week’ category increases (from 0.05 to 0.15).

disorder

Figure 4 shows the fitted probabilities for perceived collective efficacy (adjusting for the
other variables in the model, fixing their levels at their mean). As perceived collective efficacy
increases, so the predicted probability of being in one of the more frequent worry groups decreases,
while the predicted probability of being in the least frequent worry group increases.

Finally, Tables 5 and 6 present the fitted probabilities for direct and indirect victimisation
experience (adjusting for the other variables in the model, fixing their levels at their mean). We show
strong statistical effects of victimisation, particularly when it is direct victimisation. For example, the
expected probability of being unworried among those people without direct victimisation experience
(and controlling for age, gender, perceptions of disorder, perceptions of collective efficacy, and
indirect victimisation experience) is 0.63, while the comparable expected probability among those
people with direct victimisation experience is 0.27. For indirect victimisation experience, the relevant
fitted probabilities are 0.68 (no experience) and 0.38 (experience).
Focusing on the most extreme worry about crime category (i.e. dysfunctional, more than once
a week), the fitted probability for someone without direct victimisation experience is 0.04, but for
someone with direct victimisation it is 0.17. Similarly, the fitted probability for someone without
indirect victimisation experience is 0.02, but for someone with direct victimisation it is 0.15.

Summary
Overall, the findings contribute to the fear of crime literature by building on work by Gray
and colleagues (Gray et al., 2008a; Jackson & Gray, 2010; Gray et al., 2011; see also Chataway, Hart,
& Bond, 2019; Chataway & Hart, 2016). First, we found that only a small number of research
participants (12%) reported frequent (defined here as ‘more than once a week’) dysfunctional worry
about crime. This is similar to Gray et al.’s (2011) London-based study, which found that 16%
respondents fell into the dysfunctional worry category. National comparisons can also be made.
Drawing on data from national probability samples in Italy, Bulgaria and Lithuania, Jackson & Kuha
(2016) found that 4%, 6% and 10% respectively were in the ‘persistent and chronic worry’ group
(these individuals reported being worried ‘some of the time’ or ‘most or all of the time’). Analysing
data from Round 5 of the European Social Survey, Jackson & Kuha (2014) found that 5% of
individuals in the combined 23 European countries fell into the ‘persistent’ worry category, albeit that
this was a pooled estimate that masked some variation (e.g. it was 10% in Portugal, 4% in the UK and
1% in Denmark).
Second, like Gray et al. (2011) we found that direct and indirect victimization experience was
associated with more frequent and dysfunctional worry about crime. This is not terribly surprising, but
it is important to produce evidence that suggests worry has the potential to ‘flip’ from
infrequent/functional into frequent/dysfunctional when people experience victimization personally
and/or vicariously. Third, the more disorder people saw in their neighbourhoods, the more likely they
were to fall into the top two fear of crime categories (‘dysfunctional worry - worried between once a
week and just less than once a month and ‘dysfunctional worry - worried more than once a week’).
This departs a little from Gray et al.’s (2011) work, who found that perceived disorder differentiated
between the ‘unworried’ and each of the other four different types of fear. Finally, perceived
collective efficacy was also a significant predictor in the current study, albeit less strongly related to
worry about crime compared to disorder. In Gray et al. (2011), collective efficacy played a very
similar role to disorder.

Limitations
Some limitations of the study must be acknowledged. This was a cross-sectional survey, so
we have insight into dynamics over time and we cannot engage in causal inference. Nor did we use
experience sampling methods (see Solymosi, Bowers, & Fujiyama, 2015, 2018; Chataway & Hart,
2016; Chataway, Hart, & Bond 2019). Ideally, we would have taken into account social and structural
characteristics of the neighbourhood (see Brunton-Smith et al., 2014; Côté-Lussier et al., 2015) and
use innovative statistical techniques to estimate cluster-level means and variance (Brunton-Smith,

15

Sturgis, & Leckie 2018; Jackson et al., 2019). But the sample design precluded that.

A comprehensive and tailored response to fear of crime
From a policy perspective, the results of this study reinforce the findings of Gray et al. (2011)
regarding functional fear. They demonstrate that given the right socio-spatial context some residents
have the capacity to manage their worry without negative impacts in a way that also reduces that
worry.
These findings demonstrate the importance of taking a comprehensive and tailored approach
to addressing functional and dysfunctional fear of crime at the neighbourhood level through targeted
community programs that emphasise social inclusion and increase resident participation, reduce signs
of disorder, encourage pro-social precautions, ‘activate’ streetscapes in consultation with local
communities and draw on the support of ongoing interagency collaboration.
Effective removal of signs of community disorder, upkeep in public areas and ensured
accessibility are almost always likely to be broadly effective. Reducing visible signs of disorder can
reduce the anxiety of some residents about the capacity for crime in an area, however, there is no
single approach to such strategies and each locality is likely to respond differently to a variety of
initiatives. While ‘activating’ street spaces and encouraging street art in one area might be seen to
reduce community disorder to residents, in another it may appear to some to facilitate it. Community
involvement is key to implementing the best local strategies. Such programs should be approached
with a clear set of goals and an evaluation strategy to establish whether they do indeed reduce worry
about crime, in conjunction with the measurement of related goals.
While some precautionary measures are unlikely to reduce worry, others clearly can.
Encouraging pro-social responses to worry about crime that do not negatively affect citizens’ quality
of life could include campaigns about how to get involved in neighbourhood groups, community
associations and non-worry inducing information about how to stay secure at home and in public.
However, the targeting of these resources is also important given the small percentage of residents
that worry intensely.
Streetscape activation and applying the principles of Crime Prevention Through
Environmental Design (CPTED) speak directly to the findings. The spaces that appear frightening or
worrying to respondents tend to be of two types and both intensify worry in evening periods. The first
are spaces that tend to be empty of people, relatively poorly lit, and exhibit signs of disrepair and
disorder. The second are activated spaces where singular drinking cultures are dominant and where
the perceptions of drunken or drug-affected behaviours disincentivise diverse use of public space.
Improved street-lighting, clear way-finding, and other CPTED style interventions may reduce worry
about some areas of the city. In some cases spatial activation can render underused spaces userfriendly.
There are many potential solutions to worry about crime that require a concerted, interagency
approach, as many of these solutions straddle local, state and federal jurisdictions. These include
improvement to public transport amenity, upkeep and regulation of public and social housing,
allocation of policing resources, regulation of alcohol and illicit substances and public health
responses to fear of crime. Interagency collaboration is essential to managing these layers of
governance to ensure that public spaces are ordered in ways that reflect their diverse audiences, each
with their own expectation of the right to peaceful enjoyment.

Conclusion
This research shows that the majority of the City of Sydney participants surveyed here do not
experience episodes of worry about crime, and of those that do, most do not experience worry

16

regularly or intensely. However, around 13% of respondents report being worried about one or more
categories of crime on a weekly basis or more. While a percentage of these respondents will, based on
previous research (Ditton et al., 2000), likely be anxious individuals, many are likely to have
experienced victimisation first hand or have had someone close to them experience victimisation, or
live in situations that lead them to feel their situation is somewhat precarious – perceiving their area as
lacking informal social control, capacity for collective efficacy, or perceiving the area to be
disorganised. While only a small percentage of respondents exhibited functional fear, this does
reinforce the point that some people are able to convert their worry into positive behaviours with
positive outcomes – particularly if they perceive their community and environment as supportive.
This has implications for policy and interventions that focus on community building, social cohesion,
and the minimisation of perceived individual and social vulnerabilities.
