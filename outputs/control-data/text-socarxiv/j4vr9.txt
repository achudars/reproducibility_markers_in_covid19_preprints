Introduction
The widespread employment of smartphones by students at university level in various parts of the
world indicates that smartphones have become an important element of their e-routines. In
addition, subscribing to unlimited data plans, students gain internet access by using high-speed
Wi-Fi connectivity at home and on university campuses. The development of operating systems
such as Symbian, IOS, Windows Mobile, and Android enhances smartphone usage in the present
age. Android in particular, garners users’ interest due to the advancement of hundreds Android
oriented applications. The accessibility of the Internet via smartphones permits students to explore
various applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Skype, and GO SMS Pro (Jadhav, Bhutkar, &
Mehta, 2013). Interaction with members of family as well as friends is feasible by varied
asynchronous as well as synchronous communication tools like Viber, Line, WeChat, BBM,
KakaoTalk, Skype, Twitter, and WhatsApp (Pew Research Center, 2015).
Mobile devices offer prospects for education by letting students to access content related
to courses and converse with their course instructors and peers (Shih & Mills, 2007; KukulskaHulme & Shield, 2008; Richardson & Lenarcic, 2008; Cavus & Ibrahim, 2008, 2009; Nihalani &
Mayrath, 2010). The universal existence besides the unique aspects of Mobile Instant Messaging
(MIM) apps present in smartphones possesses the tenacity to foster a competent and supportive
learning and learning platform. Rambe and Bere (2013) state that, the implementation of MIM
apps in smartphones for educational motives at university level requires exploration to the fullest.
The addition of the above tools to curriculum at university level is a challenge for researchers
exploring in the zone of learning using mobile. Course instructors who use computers to teach are
not in a comfortable position to use WhatsApp while they teach; such instructors do not realize the
capacity of MIM, which provides dialogic space for students to involve in learning through
collaboration (Rambe & Bere, 2013).
It is useful to understand whether students at university level could improve their English
using this newest communication source at which as per (Jadhav, Bhutkar, & Mehta 2013),
WhatsApp is the most-used messenger app by students studying in university. The current
generation’s dependence on platforms based on social networking such as WhatsApp supports the
language learning aspect of students. At present, WhatsApp is known for its specialty as a
widespread and well-known social networking platform; also, it is helpful to examine whether
activities using WhatsApp may lead to learning of English language either through direct or
indirect means. In terms of figures, nearly 1 billion people use WhatsApp across 180 countries to
stay connected with family members as well as friends (“About WhatsApp,” 2018). Considering
the fact with regard to a number of WhatsApp users, is WhatsApp an efficient English learning
base for students studying in university? What are the opinions of students studying at university
on using WhatsApp concerning learning English? Can WhatsApp truly assist students in learning
English language?
A sort of reaction to such questions, this study intends to inspect whether students perceive
WhatsApp as a significant and constructive platform that could enhance, strengthen, or support
the aspect of English language learning. This study would guide and facilitate researchers and
educators recognize that WhatsApp is potential for contributing to English language learning.
Moreover, the present work suggests means in which students learning foreign language can

increase their language skills using WhatsApp, chiefly in the areas of speaking, vocabulary,
writing and reading. Considering the outcomes of the present study, policymakers, educators, and
course instructors can develop and incorporate relevant, essential, and innovative pedagogical
inputs that make efficient employment of WhatsApp for learning English language. The present
study features the following research questions:
1. What are students’ common practices or uses of WhatsApp?
2. Do students consider WhatsApp as an online platform that helps to advance their English
language learning? If yes, in what aspect?
Literature review and theoretical perspectives
WhatsApp as a platform for learning English
As a bonus to Facebook and Twitter, WhatsApp is a rising online platform that facilitates teaching
and learning in classroom. Many online resources provide tips for educators concerned with
utilizing of WhatsApp as a means for teaching. In addition, various articles are present on
institutional home pages, personal blogs, and other general websites featuring about the advantages
of utilizing WhatsApp in learning and teaching by employing its special aspects like chat groups,
audio, videos, and graphics. These features facilitate real-time communication between teachers
and students, allowing students to persist in learning even beyond the classroom. WhatsApp’s
exclusive features motivate students to connect and correspond in any language with anyone in the
world. Nevertheless, one should have the understanding and familiarity with English to exploit the
application, as it features the application of English in all its aspects. As a whole, all of the abovesaid aspects of WhatsApp signifies that it holds the potential as a means for English language
learning at university level.
The foundational ideas, which revolve in this research work, fall in line with the study
(Godwin-Jones, 2008) who demonstrates that technology-based tools like WhatsApp, which can
enhance communication, interaction with one person to another person besides language learning.
(Gon & Rawekar, 2017) state that WhatsApp has become a new and convenient platform for
teaching and teaching with which teachers can be present anywhere and at any time. (Rambe &
Chipunza, 2013) and (Riyanto 2013) also emphasize that WhatsApp could be utilized as a means
to enhance students’ language skills, as it provides students the chance to present their opinions in
an open platform. Special features available in WhatsApp have the capacity to boost students’
dynamic participation in EFL classrooms (Baffour-Awuah, 2015) and inspire them to get involved
in purposeful activities with a special emphasize on effective learning outcomes (Beetham &
Sharpe, 2013). WhatsApp supports a great number of functionalities that gives chances for
pedagogical rethinking (Conole & Alevizou, 2010).
(Sharma and Shukla, 2017) conduct a sociological study regarding students’ utilization of
WhatsApp concerning frequency, reasons, fulfillment of academic and personal needs, most-used
features, and the technology’s influence on their academic performance to recognize the means in
which WhatsApp is utilized by the younger generation. Regarding collaborative research projects,
(Ngaleka & Uys, 2013) study the deployment of WhatsApp through a group of students studying
undergraduate course (Alghazo & Nash, 2017), investigate WhatsApp’s impact as a tool to manage
classroom concerning students’ accomplishment and in-class behavior. The study utilized an

experimental as well as control group, and the results proved that there was no major variation
between both the groups regarding course achievement, though WhatsApp had a constructive
effect by lowering absentees in the class and missed assignments, an indication of positive class
behavior.
From the perspective of learning a language, (Salem, 2013) explores WhatsApp’s impact
in learning the English language in Kuwait and Gutiérrez-Colon et al. (2013) study the aspect of
WhatsApp in learning English. (Alsaleem, 2014) finds that utilizing WhatsApp as an authentic
platform to enhance writing, vocabulary, word choice, and communication in English, students
were in a situation to meet the linguistic, grammatical, and functional objectives of the language
course. (Gasmi, 2014) explores the impact, potential benefits, and limitations of utilizing
WhatsApp to develop writing skills of Omani students. (Allagui, 2014) explores the WhatsApp’s
effectiveness in enhancing undergraduate students’ basic EFL writing skills at university level,
finding those students’ motivation levels for writing increased while using WhatsApp.
Aburezeq & Ishtaiwa, (2013) try to comprehend WhatsApp’s effectiveness on interaction
in an Arabic language-teaching course. They found out that WhatsApp developed three varieties
of interactions: student-content interaction (54%), student-student interaction (71%), and studentinstructor interaction (42%). The study in addition recognized that WhatsApp provided a virtual
space for expressing ideas, communicating, and exchanging information. (Han & Keskin, 2016)
observe the influence of WhatsApp tasks on students’ speaking anxiety at university. The results
of the study brought forth the views that students’ EFL speaking anxiety was considerably
diminished owing to their employment of WhatsApp during the language acquisition process. In
addition, (Samaie et. al,2016) study WhatsApp’s efficiency for peer -and self-assessments of oral
language proficiency, aiming to look at the dissimilarities between mobile-assisted self and peer
assessments, procedural differences between mobile-assisted self and peer assessments,
participants’ attitude change toward both assessments, and reasons for attitude changes.
Theories of learning in the WhatsApp platform
The present study makes use of the theories of incidental learning, active learning, activity,
community sharing, and learning communities, that acknowledge the notion that collaboration
encourages learning. WhatsApp encourages the creation of an online group to learn and teach
within students who work together while taking part in course exercises. WhatsApp as a medium
advances the growth and spread of information among participating and communicating students
by collaborative learning exercises (Bielaczyc & Collins, 1999). WhatsApp interventions persuade
students to make enquiries that can be immediately addressed while taking an interest in a helpful,
intuitive, and collective group (Rovai, 2002).
Much research examines online platforms for education; in particular, research work
related to reading comprehension along with learning vocabulary employ concepts concerning
incidental learning to elucidate patterns of learning and behaviors (Shahrokni, 2009; Chun, &
Plass, 1996; Akbulut, 2007). In an educational course, incidental learning leads to unplanned or
unintentional learning, thereby resulting in both non-academic and academic activities (Kerka,
2000). Incidental learning is successful by means of solving problems, social interaction,
repetition, and observation (Rogers, 1997), and in addition when tasks are completed in an online

setup (McFerrin, 1999). Holzinger, Pichler, Almer, and Maurer (2001) state that incidental
learning from the viewpoint of education and technology would incorporate the theory of (RossGordon & Dowling, 1995), who proposed that learning occurs through mistakes, doing,
networking, and a sequence of interpersonal experiments. Likewise, (Herrmann, Fox, & Boyd,
2000) state that the combination of technology with education leads to both optimistic and
pessimistic outcomes from an intentional or unintentional view. Therefore, it is implied that
employing online technologies in education may have both negative and positive impact on
students.
According to Nagel and Kotzé (2010), incidental learning happens in a community of
practice and focus must be on the idea of interpersonal relationships, community building, and
social networking as other ways to learn, observe, and experience. Such activities could happen
while people with related interests use WhatsApp. In a pedagogical setting, members of the group
can continue to have dynamic and significant educational experiences.
The activity theory at individual, community, and technological levels forms a theoretical
outline for collaborative learning process. Activity theory encourages teachers to reintroduce
information (Mercier & Higgins, 2013) where online collaborative learning approaches are
implemented in online communities to enhance language-learning activities. This theory may help
teachers identify important aspects of students' requirements to take in online interaction.
(Engestrom,1987), proposes community sharing, which is an additional theoretical basis
for the current study. Engstrom proposes that activity theory includes rules that encourage the
division of work between the subject and learning group. The community sharing theory examines
the social and mechanical parts of activity pertaining to society (Bertelsen & Bødker, 2003). Group
or externalization is reflected as a social scenario of the framework and a group level of activity
theory. In an experimental study, all students are occupied with the activity system whereby their
involvement in learning depends on social correspondence; they articulate their opinion to form a
community focused on learning.
Anecdotal facts as well as research have revealed both negative and positive impacts of
the deployment of WhatsApp for teaching and learning purposes. Positive aspects include
enhanced communication between teachers and students (Khatun & Al-Dhlan, 2017),
strengthening of students’ learning and enthusiasm (Hamad, 2017), creation of pleasant platforms
and in-depth acquaintance with fellow students, better access to learning materials, as well as
greater teacher availability (Veeresh & Kumara, 2017). Contrarily, negative aspects include
annoyance caused by excessive irrelevant messages (Najafi & Tridane 2015), internet addiction,
and its effect on educational triumph as well as mental health (Kakkar, Ahuja & Dahiya, 2015).
Owing to this varied influence of WhatsApp, a debate still exists about whether WhatsApp should
be seriously considered as a platform for learning, particularly at university level.

their opinions on WhatsApp as an online educational platform.. The survey would be resourceful
in recognizing the basic problems which are of worry to students who happen to use WhatsApp
for learning the English language. The study randomly chose 300 students studying from King
Saud University to take part in present survey through convenience sampling.
Instrument and data analysis
A questionnaire was used in this survey study consisting of two parts. Section A focuses on
students’ demographic information and language usage. The demographic data gathered was
students’ language abilities and gender. Section B gathers information about students’ use of
WhatsApp and Section C consists of 14 items about learning English using WhatsApp. The
elements in Section C were obtained from Blattner and Fiori (2009), who studied English learning
via Facebook. The aspects were modifiedon needs analysis, experiences and observations of
dynamic users of WhatsApp. A 5-point Likert scale of “strongly disagree” to “strongly agree” was
utilized to collect students’ responses. The items in this section emphasize the enhancement of
students’ language skills and confidence, motivation and attitude towards learning English
language.
To analyze the demographic facts and practices of WhatsApp, percentages and frequency
were used. To describe the elements in section C, frequency, mean score and percentages were
extensively utilized to reflect students’ views on WhatsApp as a learning platform platform for
English.
Findings and Discussion
The forthcoming three sections discuss the outcomes of the survey. The first section deals with the
demographic facts; next section briefs students’ common practices and uses of WhatsApp. Section
three addresses WhatsApp’s function as an online platform platformthat helps students to learn
English language.; i.e., whether WhatsApp has positive effects on (1) the enhancement of students’
language skills and (2) students’ confidence attitude, and motivation concerning English language
learning.
Demographic data
Overall, 163 male (54%) and 137 (49%) female students participated in present study. Of all the
students, 20% used English to converse through WhatsApp while 80 % of the students used both
Arabic and English.
Students’ general uses of WhatsApp
All the 300 students were involved in the study used WhatsApp; it had already become a part of
their e-routines for communication. Almost 78% of the students answered that they were part of a
WhatsApp group and the remaining 22% said that they were not a part of any WhatsApp group.

WhatsApp as an online platform that facilitates English language learning
By considering the mean scores of all the sixteen aspects given in Table 1, a large number of
students answered that they agreed that WhatsApp could serve as an online platform to facilitate
English language learning in terms of the enhancement of (1) language skills and (2) their

confidence, attitudes and motivation towards English language learning. As a whole, the students
gave a positive response that WhatsApp helps them inculcate a more positive attitude concerning
learning English as a second language (mean score = 3.65), improve their communication skills
(mean score = 3.88), enhance their reading skills (mean score = 3.85), improve their writing skills
(mean score = 3.82), learn new vocabulary (mean score = 3.81), and enhances their confidence to
write, read, and communicate, respectively (mean score = 3.78, 3.65 and 3.75). These positive
views towards WhatsApp as platform a platform to facilitate English language learning may be
attributed to the view point that online platforms present an authentic communicative space. Such
experiences might lead to learning L2 and broaden students’ understanding of subject matter taught
in the classroom. They create a feasible ambience by giving scope for the students to interact
collaboratively concerning clarity, peer assessment, and other language-related perspectives
(Mwakapina, Mhandeni, & Nyinondi, 2016).

Improvement of language skills
As per Table 1, although the mean scores for the majority of the items were below 4, the overall
percentage of students who agreed and strongly agreed for all the aspects was above 60%. As a
result, it is obvious that students feel WhatsApp is an online learning platform. The percentage and
mean scores are provided to have better idea on students’ views concerning their patterns and
practices of using WhatsApp to learn English.
In the present study, the students felt that WhatsApp could be an efficient online platform
in which to use English. Nearly 61% of students felt positively that WhatsApp had paved the way
to increase their communication skills (mean score = 3.88). Text-based communication leads to
healthy interaction, thereby eliminating hurdles lack of communication like, shyness, cultural
differences, lack of time , and other language learning issues faced by students in English
classrooms. With WhatsApp, there are plenty of chances for all students to share their thoughts on
any given topic, especially those who are intimidated to converse in class or those who require
some time to plan, think, and respond. The anonymity present in WhatsApp language learning
tasks may also add to the development of students’ communication (Aburezaq & Ishtaiwa (2013).
Almost 63.6% of students felt that they could write better after starting to use WhatsApp for the
purpose of exchanging messages (mean score = 3.82). According to Alsaleem (2014), WhatsApp
electronic journaling would permit university EFL teachers to include writing in their subject
matter across the syllabus to assist students to increase their writing skills. In addition, 64% of
students felt that their reading skills had improved while using WhatsApp (mean score = 3.85).
The results of the reading skills, for the present study concurs with that of Hazaea and Alzubi
(2016), who implemented an experimental study to understand the effect of mobile technologies
in enhancing students’ reading skills. The study’s outcome showed a marginal enhancement in
participants’ code-breaking practices, text use, text participation practices, as well as text analysis
practices while using WhatsApp. Students acknowledge that WhatsApp provides them
opportunities and scope for language improvement.
Confidence
As a language-learning tool, WhatsApp helps students possess confidence in their capabilities
(Hamad, 2017). Regarding the enhancement of students’ confidence levels, 60% of students felt

that WhatsApp could increase their level of confidence in writing in English (mean score = 3.78).
In addition, 65% of students felt that by using WhatsApp, their confidence in reading had increased
(mean score = 3.65). As for students’ communication skills using English, 60% of students
believed that their confidence level had improved (mean score = 3.75). According to Kumar, Lian,
&Vasudevan (2016), WhatsApp can improve students’ confidence levels and the process of
language learning concerning both spoken and written forms. (Motteram, 2013) proposes that
students’ reading skills could be developed by means of WhatsApp because it offers an authentic
chance to converse with various people from various parts of the world using English. (Yunus &
Chenzi ,2012) state that technology-based activities will increase students’ confidence levels and
nurture positive learning attitudes. It is understood that confidence levels are substantial
concerning use of WhatsApp to improve reading skills. Henceforth, curriculum designers and
textbook writers should make it a point to consider the positive aspects of incorporating WhatsApp
for the enhancement of reading skills (Khalaf, 2017).
Motivation
With regard to motivation, 64% of students felt motivated largely to converse in English (mean
score = 3.75). Nearly 61 % of students felt motivated by large extent to read in English (mean
score = 3.64). Additionally, 62% of students felt motivated to write in English (mean score = 3.62).
(Allagui, 2014) explores the usefulness of instant text messaging using WhatsApp at university
level for undergraduate students and finds that students’ motivation levels for writing increased
when WhatsApp was implemented in the classroom. According to Awada (2016), WhatsApp is
helpful in developing students’ critique writing proficiency regarding rhetoric when compared to
conventional modes of teaching. The present work also recommends that course instructors use
mobile apps to enhance students’ motivation for learning English writing. (Kumar, Lian, &
Vasudevan, 2016) in their survey study discover that students were further motivated to utilize
Mandarin after utilizing WhatsApp as a source to learn the language. (Plana et al.2013) in Spain
probe the implementation of WhatsApp in English language learning and report that there was a
rise in students’ motivation concerning reading skills. (Manan,2017) finds that WhatsApp plays a
critical part in motivating students to learn. In particular, motivation level of the students increased
with regard to speaking in English in presentations and group discussions after using WhatsApp.
The above said studies fall in line with the outcomes of this study, clearly showing that WhatsApp
has a greater role with regard to the motivation of students to speak, read and write.
Attitude
With a mean score of 3.68, nearly 65% of students believed that WhatsApp provided them a base
for learning English. (So, 2016) studies the utilization of WhatsApp to enhance learning and
teaching at university level and confirmed that WhatsApp could bring out i nnovative
opportunities to learn, promote effective communication, allow for significant feedback, offer
formal and informal learning opportunities, and support collaborative learning. This precisely
emphasizes that WhatsApp offers a space for students to learn English. Nearly 61% of students
felt that WhatsApp helps them learn new vocabulary (mean score = 3.81). (Gürocak,2016)
examines the effect of mobile learning and students’ attitudes regarding this technology and,
similar to this study, found that mobile language learning situations could increase students’
knowledge of vocabulary and support them in learning target words. This indicates that vocabulary
learning through mobile phones can be motivating. ( Lu, 2008) further emphasizes that students

in general hold positive attitudes towards learning vocabulary via mobile phones. 64% of students
had positive attitudes concerning WhatsApp’s use in learning English as a second language (mean
score = 3.65), which concurs with many prior studies that have figured out that most of the
stakeholders in educational institutions show a optimistic attitude concerning the use of such
technologies to learning (Bere, 2012; Bouhnik & Deshen, 2014; Demirbilek, 2010; Cochrane &
Bateman, 2010). In addition, 62% of students felt that WhatsApp made learning easier (mean score
= 3.69). This is supplemented by a study conducted by Amry (2014), at which students’ attitudes
were positive towards WhatsApp as it made their learning easier. This may be because technology
paves the path for the self-learning process as well as easy access to data that teachers may not be
capable to provide (Lam and Lawrence, 2002). Nearly 60% of students felt that WhatsApp helps
them bear language mistakes (mean score = 3.52). This particular view is similar to that discussed
by (Mwakapina, Mhandeni & Nyinondi,2016), who emphasizes that WhatsApp created a
supportive and safe platform for learning. Students are often concerned about making mistakes
while learning a language, and WhatsApp can help them stay positive and relaxed within their
friendship circles. The more relaxed the students feel while language learning, the more likely they
are to participate without much concern about their language mistakes.
Conclusions and Implications
In this study, we attempted to examine King Saud University students' beliefs and practices
regarding WhatsApp as an online platform to learn English. The study’s outcome proposes that
while WhatsApp is utilized as an online platform to provide communicative opportunities, it can
lead to implicit learning both outside as well as inside of the classroom. To exploit the positive
aspects of WhatsApp for learning, it is mandatory to motivate students to identify, comprehend,
and engage in learning opportunities using WhatsApp. This will let students to augment their levels
of confidence, knowledge, competence, lifelong learning perspectives, and life skills (Mealman,
1993). In view of this, teachers can implement teaching-learning tasks that use WhatsApp both as
a platform to study as well as a way for socialization. This can be accomplished in an organized
way by informing the students in relation to the objectives and learning outcomes of tasks with a
special emphasis on learning aspects rather than other general uses of WhatsApp.
