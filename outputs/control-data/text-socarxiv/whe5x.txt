How do Chinese information inspectors censor the internet? In light of the
assumption that inspectors must follow specific rules instead of ambiguous
guidelines, such as precluding collective action, to decide what and when to
delete, this study attempts to offer a dynamic understanding of censorship
by exploiting well-structured Weibo data from before and after the 2018 Taiwanese election. This study finds that inspectors take advantage of time in handling online discussions with the potential for collective action. Through this
deferral tactic, inspectors make online sentiments moderately flow regarding
an important political event, and thereafter, past discussions on trendy topics
will be mostly removed. Therefore, reality is selectively altered; the past is
modified, and the future will be remembered in a “preferable” way.

Introduction
The Chinese government has established a complex system of institutions and practices of censorship and governance, which create certain myths for scholars to explore (1–6). The Chinese
government exerts control over the media and other sources of information through a network
1

of departments that monitor and enforce censorship policies. The whole censorship system
consists of a complicated process and various executors, making the questions of how and who
exactly is doing this job almost unanswerable.
Studies have found that Chinese internet censorship strategies differ across internet companies. Each company complies with the needs or goals set by the government and laws (7). We
cannot know exactly when and by whom the online discussions are dealt with, nor can we fully
confirm the connection between the government and the companies behind each censorship
strategy, such as when the government will step in to achieve its needs and goals of censorship.
As a matter of fact, many studies stealthily proclaim that censorship is executed by the government but provide no evidence. Henceforth, in this paper, we acknowledge and conceptualize
an internet information inspector as any actor who may review content and make decisions on
censorship. Since unpacking the black box of the whole sensitive administrative procedure is
unrealistic, our focus in this paper is on the exact censoring mechanism behind inspectors with
respect to the corresponding online content.
How do Chinese information inspectors censor the internet? The existing literature has unraveled the mechanisms of China’s censorship, such as creating fear through the use of laws to
make people self-censor themselves, building up frictions to make it costly for people to find
and spread sensitive messages, and flooding people with disperse, noisy, and distracting information to divert the public opinion. The purpose of mechanisms is to primarily defuse collective
action and permit proper criticism for the purpose of sustaining authoritarian resilience. However, there must be certain rules for inspectors to follow in deciding what and when to delete.
The guidelines, such as precluding collective action, are rather ambiguous and are difficult for
inspectors to follow. Therefore, we believe and assume that with a task that is both complex
and politically risky, there must exist a naı̈ve rule that guides basic conduct in censorship.
In light of this assumption, this study aims to offer a dynamic understanding of censor2

ship. We utilize the data of Sina Weibo (China’s largest social media platform), which are
sufficiently large to provide us with statistical power to conduct ex ante observations and ex
post checks on censorship processes surrounding critical political events, including changes in
content networks, the distribution of relevant deleted content, and tactics regarding deleting.
Methodologically, the data used include the shares, posts and comments of 203,589 Weibo accounts (total of 349,306 posts) before and after the 2018 Taiwanese election (November 24,
2018). We perform a social network analysis using links among shares, comments and original
posts before and after the election to construct the whole network of these posts. URLs are
extracted to verify the retention status of posts and comments.
We find that mainstream official media accounts play the prevailing role in dominating
political-related discussions and communication in the course of censorship. In addition, most
importantly, inspectors capitalize on selective strategies on account that posts that contain some
sensitive words and topics, such as those relating to LGBT (10) rights, will be published through
censorship but are restricted from spreading. Additionally, we identify a deferral tactic that allows some politically incorrect online discussions to be published in the first place and deleted
afterward. In other words, the discussions are selectively pruned and altered. As a result, they
will be observed and remembered in a “preferable” way. Through their use of this tactic, we
propose that Chinese inspectors prevent online collective action through gradual and partial actions, rather than through immediate and thorough actions. They confine or avert deviant posts
and debates in the first place so as not to fuel the related momentum. They eventually will step
in and finish their censorship jobs (e.g., deleting posts) in the same way in which they would
have done so in the very beginning.

Problems with Chinese Censorship
There is no reason to judge censorship as a means of information management. Different governments have different means of conducting censorship. Each government adopts a unique
censorship system according to its national conditions (11). In general, governments screen
online information and delete hazardous or untrue information, including that threatening the
security of the nation, the unity of ethnic groups and the stability of society, as well as that
spreading rumors, pornography, and violence. In China, the transmission of politically and socially sensitive information on social media is limited due to platform-wide keyword filters and
ex post content deletion. Sometimes, when an individual posts sensitive or untrue content online, the inspector will delete or restrict the post from broadcasting and remove the individual’s
account (12–14).
Previous empirical studies on content moderation in Chinese social media focus mainly on
the censorship of messages and the fabrication of public opinion. For example, they examine
how topics are associated with the intensity and velocity of censorship (15), and the fabrication
of public opinion (16). Influential studies on this topic have revealed how the Chinese censorship apparatus emphasizes the silencing of expression that could potentially lead to collective
action (16–18). Furthermore, using modern computer-assisted textual analytical methods and a
large-scale experimental approach, internet censorship in China aims to preclude the collective
action that can occur in the real world or that may be fostered or mobilized in cyberspace, while
posts criticizing officials, governments or certain policies are retained for their positive value
in consultation and surveilling local governance (18, 19). To control social media, the Chinese
government is believed not only to delete online content but also to hire internet commentators
(e.g., scholars, activists, journalists, and social media participants, namely, the 50 cent party)
to post favorable comments about government policies as a way to sway public opinion, rather

4

than to argue and even to engage in controversial issues. With such actions, these commentators redirect public attention from criticism and central issues to cheerleading and positive
discussions of valence issues. Moreover, they create alternative hot topics online to distract
people from their original concerns to distort the popularity of issues with high possibilities of
motivating collective action (16, 20).
It is impossible to identify how many and which social media posts and comments are
censored by governments. There are missing data that cannot be observed. To retrieve the
unobservable data, previous research actively posted comments to social media sites in China
and then waited to see which of these never appeared, which of these disappeared, and which
of these appeared and survived (18). By varying the content of posts across topics, previous
scholars concluded that any mentions of collective action in posts are selectively suppressed.
Following the same belief that Chinese censorship paradoxically leaves large footprints and so
reveals the behavioral patterns and intentions of the government (16–18), we move deeper to
explore the process of censorship surrounding political events, when censorship happens more
often. In the end, we will unscramble the motives behind such censorship and reveal the history
of disappearing posts and comments.
As an observational study with sufficiently large data, we are not immune to the problem
of selection bias due to the missing unobservable data caused by censorship. Nevertheless, the
reality is that it is the published content and what happens to it that drive the trend of public
opinion and the possibility of collective action. The ex ante filtering techniques of inspectors
prevent a great deal of content from being automatically published without being reviewed (22),
but people can constantly bypass these filtering techniques with various approaches (23–28) to
publish new content on a particular issue that they zealously endorse. Inspectors have to address
this problem to achieve their censorship goal; that is, they have to deal with published content
in one way or another.
5

Furthermore, if we try to look at the content targeted by censors, it is not quite realistic to
simply decide what to delete. It is unmanageable for censors to differentiate what words or
posts exactly are against their goals to stop criticism of the government, leaders, and policies
and to put a stop to collective action. Therefore, one way to manage such an unmanageable
task is to have a simple rule of basic censorship conduct with a clear goal: delete anything that
either has a negative impact on society and the state or is not politically correct. Nevertheless,
the problem remains that, sometimes, posts of this sort still manage to bypass censorship. In
this paper, we seek to unearth how censorship is carried out under this situation. We conjecture
that time is the crux that provides a buffer zone for censors in making adaptive and necessary
moves and eventually accomplishing their censorship work.

Data and Methods
Internet censorship takes place with the click of a mouse. The monitoring of online content is
a nearly infeasible task. To make our observational analysis tenable, in every minute between
October and December 2018, we scraped the data of posts related to Taiwan and the comments
and shares associated with these posts from Sina Weibo (29). Two events—the Golden Horse
Film Festival and Awards (on November 17, 2018) and the 2018 Taiwan election (30) (on
November 24, 2018)—are zealously discussed and create two spikes in the data (see Fig. 1).
We choose to analyze the second spike instead of the first because the election was highly
political and the festival was mixed with entertaining news and gossips about movie stars. In
other words, we make such a choice simply to rule out any potential confounding factors that
are less relevant to our study (31).
The data in the analysis include online discussions before and after the 2018 Taiwan election, which showed an increase in online public opinion of China toward Taiwan and the crossStrait relationship. Any discussion of the cross-Strait relationship, which might negatively in6

Date of Posts

Fig. 1. The plot of the number of Weibo posts by date. Two spikes were observed
near election day. We chose to ignore the first spike simply because it was less political
and concerned the Golden Horse Film Festival and Awards, which is an awards festival
for movies produced in Mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan. The second
spike concerned the election.
fluence its unification with China, often triggers the Chinese government to censor. Henceforth,
if censorship did happen in the study period, then we will be able to observe how it was carried
out. We define November 22-24, the first three days of the election, as Time 1, and November
25-27, the three days after the election, as Time 2 to conduct ex ante and ex post comparisons.
Fig. 1 shows that these six days correspond to the ebb and flow of the online discussions. We
have a total of 33,057 Weibo posts and 316,249 comments, belonging to 203,589 unique ID
accounts.
We further extract data for the convenience of social network analysis. Based on the data,
the “poster ID” is extracted as a unique identification code used to build nodes in the social
network analysis. When an ID posts multiple messages at the same time, it is regarded as the

7

interaction between a node and other information. We intercept the “post location” from the
post and use only provincial information to construct Fig. 2.
We build the network connection by using “poster IDs” as source nodes and “original poster
IDs” as target nodes. Original posts with no connection are omitted. We implement the social
network analysis and plot the network diagrams using Gephi 0.9.2 with the Force Atlas 2 layout
algorithm.
Furthermore, we verified whether each of those posts, comments and shares still existed by
revisiting their URLs in October 2019.

Result and Findings
There is a clear pattern in terms of the geographical locations of posts. Fig. 2a displays that
most discussions with regard to the 2018 Taiwanese election were posted from coastal areas
in China. Overseas users and users with unidentifiable locations also contributed significantly
to the volume of posts during this period (approximately 30%). Fig 2b shows a similar pattern, indicating that the geographical locations of the posts before and after the election date
(November 24, 2018) did not vary much. This finding may simply imply that had there existed
some censorship occurring with regard to this election during these six days, then the action
was uniformly carried out across China.
Fig. 3 demonstrates the whole network structure of the posts between November 22 and
27, 2018, which reveals a clear structural change in the networks. With the large amount of
data in the analysis (150 thousands data points in each time period), we observe a hairball-like
structure both in Figs. 3a and 3b. Nodes with 1 degree (a node links or is linked to another
node) are masked from the whole network, which leaves us with 1% of the data, to better
reveal the whole structure. Nevertheless, we can still identify the transformation of the structure
from a polycentric one in November 22-24 to a monocentric one in November 22-27. The

network in Fig. 3a is rather dispersed and has two clear clusters of nodes (colored in yellow and
green), which are distant from each other (33). Conversely, the network in Fig. 3b is heavily
concentrated with a major cluster in the center.
This evolutionary change from Time 1 to Time 2 indicates that the discussions were pluralistic in the very beginning and became monotonic afterwards, which is a clear sign of censorship.
In both Figs. 3a and 3b, the dominant nodes (i.e., the opinion leaders) are always the official
media, suggesting that with regard to the posts in these two time periods, the official media
dominated the online discussion on Weibo.
In both periods, the official media always dominated the discussions (see Table 1). The
official media has higher degrees of involvement before and after the election, and its involvement has increased significantly after the event. Moreover, content posted by personal accounts
with higher degrees of involvement was either deleted or prohibited from receiving further comments (34). In particular, LGBT issues stood out as a heat topic for discussion in these time
periods. Nevertheless, such content was purged from Weibo afterward, as we revisited these

posts in October 2019.
In short, we have identified a structural change through social network analysis before and
after the 2018 Taiwanese election. This finding suggests a sign of censorship that trimmed the
polycentric network down to a monocentric network dominated by the official media. After
revisiting the posts, we have identified the further filtering of online content. One-fifth of the
posts had been either removed or restricted from receiving further comments (see Table 2).
Surely, censorship existed during the study period. The reason that some sensitive content
fell under the censorship radar in the first place remains an intriguing topic We will use the
online discussion of LGBT issues in the following sections to elaborate on this deferral tactic
in Chinese censorship.

Discussion
Why were LGBT issues targeted?

The Chinese government always faces political and social

pressure when Taiwan holds an election because the election results may lead to a major policy
shift in Mainland China. For instance, Taiwan had a peaceful relationship with China between
2008 and 2016 when the pro-unification Nationalist Party (the KMT) held administrative power.
The situation has deteriorated since the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)
came to power in 2016. The major disagreement across the Strait has been the fact that the DPP
does not recognize the so-called “92 consensus”, which is an agreement reached between the
two sides in 1992, stating that Taiwan is a part of “One China”.
Internationally, China is strongly defending its “One China” policy. China’s expanding influence in East Asia is also a part of this policy. Taiwan’s position as the new leading force
regarding LGBT rights in this region, where religion and conservative governments normally
keep bans in place, reflects poorly on Mainland China. A corollary follows that since Mainland
China and Taiwan share the same culture and ethnicity, if Taiwan can make progress in the
legalization of same-sex marriage, then it will demonstrate that same-sex marriage can be recognized in Chinese society, conflicting with the overall policy and attitude of Mainland China
concerning same-sex marriage (35).
Alongside the election, Taiwan also held a referendum on ten issues; half of these issues
were related to the legalization of same-sex marriage (36). This fact was bound to attract the
12

attention of Mainland Chinese homosexual individuals and LGBT groups. As minorities, these
groups are always looking for a platform and window to express themselves. Moreover, the
homosexual community in Taiwan has strived to legalize same-sex marriage and made many
preparations before this election, including demonstrations and advocacy activities. These actions have certainly attracted great attention and may even have demonstration effects on the
LGBT community in Mainland China.

Lessons from the backfire of a prompt observable mass censorship of LGBT issues. Past
incidents help explain more about the intentions behind the chosen tactic covered by our analysis. In April 2018, online activism concerning the LGBT community had appeared on Weibo
and successfully reversed a ban on LGBT content filtering following a public outcry (37).
On April 13, Sina Weibo announced a three-month cleanup campaign targeting content considered illegal, including pornography, violence, and topics relating to homosexuality, for the
purpose of creating a harmonious online environment. This move was met with intense backlash. Thousands of Weibo users used flooding hashtags such as #IAmGay and #IHaveGayFriends
to rally against such censorship. They posted content depicting homosexuality and expressed
their support for the homosexual community. Within hours of the adverse reactions from netizens, Sina Weibo chose to ban the rallying hashtag and remove most of the comments related
to the subject.
This information purge generated even wider and larger public anger. On the same day,
the company’s NASDAQ shares plummeted amid the controversy. On April 15, the People’s
Daily, China’s political propaganda newspaper, appeared to criticize Sina Weibo by publishing
a commentary emphasizing that it is a personal choice whether to approve of homosexuality.
In addition, rationally speaking, the newspaper criticized that everyone should respect other
people’s sexual orientation.

13

Facing furious reactions and pressure from the public, on April 16, Sina Weibo stated that
this cleanup campaign of homosexual content was halted. In the same vein, the inspector carried
out the censorship between November 22 and 27, 2018, with regard to LGBT rights issues with
reference to the past. Sometimes, real-time censorship acts as an engagement with netizens,
which may further flare up and worsen the situation. Thus, delayed treatment might be a viable
alternative strategy.
On account of our findings on this deferral tactic, the inspector here is Weibo, which chose
not to do the same as it had done in April to avoid deteriorating public opinion by removing a
great deal of influential content and allowing time to mediate the disagreement on the homosexual topic instead of deleting everything.

Concluding Remarks
Past research has established that China utilizes censorship with the intention of distorting citizens’ incentives to join in collective action against the regime, whereas certain criticisms of
politics and certain discussion topics were found not to be censored. By comparing the actual
records of online discussions surrounding the 2018 Taiwanese election, we further conclude that
Chinese censorship uses a deferral tactic in shaping the intensity of online discussion and the
history of online public opinion. The inspector, either the government or a company, selectively
censors the information that citizens receive and manipulate it in a way that benefits the regime.
Admittedly, the government conducts this censorship following its self-made guidelines,
and companies perform censorship according to laws and directives from the government. The
inspector not only selects topics but also chooses when to intervene, as shown in our research.
This deferral tactic indicates that content on some sensitive topics (e.g., LGBT issues) will be
published in the first place and deleted afterward, rather than deleted immediately.
Inspectors allow topics that have a risk of spurring the flow of collective action online but
14

in a restricted manner. By providing restricted freedom (38), nspectors control the intensity of
online discussions in an acceptable range and allow limited space for netizens to freely express
themselves (39–41). In this way, we believe that the inspector consciously or unconsciously
averts simultaneous extreme posts and debates due to complaints about censorship during important political events and to prevent online collective action through gradual and partial actions.
Theoretically speaking, with this deferral tactic, the mechanisms of flooding, friction, and
distraction can work even more smoothly and easily. By creating fear through the use of laws
to make people self-censor themselves, building up friction to make it costly for people to
find and spread sensitive messages, and flooding them with disperse, noisy, and distracting
information to divert public opinion, the government can realize its censorship goals. However,
when facing a large project for inspectors to work on with vast online information appearing
on various Chinese platforms, in what way could the inspector possibly conduct censorship? It
is believed that people’s experiences of being censored undermine Chinese online censorship
laws and can inspire more criticism of and discussion on sensitive issues online in China, as
a form of backfire, which can result from such expression control (42, 43). Given that time
can solve partial problems, allowing the existence of online discussions concerning sensitive
topics cannot give rise to online activism without prompt massive censorship, but as a first step,
inspectors censor only some leading actors by avoiding overstimulating them to bring about a
negative influence on the government. By adding this tactic of time before other mechanisms,
the goals of censorship collide with providing the freedom of online expression.
From the perspective of limited capability (44) to censor everything, regardless of how advanced the censor equipment held by the inspector is, it can be assumed that the government has
to do the job either actively or passively, that is, to partly censor actively and to passively censor
in a deferral way because the inspector, as part of an administrative machine, has to spend time
15

and energy identifying what exactly triggers collective action. Our hypothesized standards of
guiding censorship are simple: the inspector who scrutinizes is supposed to remove everything
considered against the law or governmental directives. Nevertheless, there are still delays in
terms of censorship, the logic being that Chinese internet censorship is strategic and selective.
The inspector conducts a preliminary deletion based on the impact of the content and a
delayed cleanup of the entire content later on to avoid stimulating topics with real collective
action potential or online collective activism potential going viral and becoming more tactful
and more responsive to the censorship of public opinion. In light of this conclusion, we can
obtain the practical logic of Chinese internet censorship.
Finally, we infer that the inspector always works to create a field of online public opinion
that is dominated by official opinions or public opinion mainstream social norms and morals,
considering that the mainstream official media dominated online discussion and communication during the 2018 Taiwanese election. Seeing the ex post disappearance of the discussions
on LGBT issues in the network, when searching for keywords after such an event period, people will be scanning an altered record of what was happening during past political events. In
addition, as time passes, the accumulation of online information could form a distribution in
which most of the discussions on certain issues are positive, proper, and harmonious. In the
end, the history of online discussions can be reconstructed rather than remaining as it is. Eventually, reality is selectively altered; the past is modified, and the future will be remembered in
a “preferable” way. In doing so, the inspector contrives the future by tampering with the past
through the use of censorship.

29. This is the largest social media platform in China. The monthly active users in 2018 numbered over 445 million.
30. The purpose of the election was to elect county magistrates (city mayors), county (city)
councilors, township mayors, township councilors and chiefs of village (borough) in 6 municipalities and 16 counties (cities). A multiquestion referendum was also held alongside
the election. The referendum was not binding; however, it could influence the subsequent
relevant policies, which could also be consequential. Elections in Taiwan usually can decisively affect Taiwan’s relationship with China.
31. Nevertheless, data filtering using keywords was still required to parse out posts that were
irrelevant to the keywords manually selected through rounds of tests by our research team
member.

33. We use the algorithm by Blondel et al. (32) to calculate the modularity statistics to cluster
nodes into several classes.
34. We revisited these posts in October 2019. The check reveals 3 conditions: currently retained, unable to leave a message, and deleted (regarded as deleted for a period of time
after the event). The first two refer to the published content being merely visible to the
corresponding account, thus having no chance of influencing anymore.
35. As in many other Western and non-Western societies, public sentiment regarding homosexuality in China sits within a limited space. Homosexuality has been a controversial topic
across both the legal and moral domains in China. Homosexual acts were officially decriminalized in 1997. In 2001, homosexuality was removed from the official list of mental
illnesses in China. However, Chinese laws have yet to properly recognize or protect samesex couples in the form of marriage. While it is not outright condemned, neither is it fully
accepted as being part of the social norm.
36. Taiwanese voters faced lengthy queues as they dealt with complex ballots that featured 10
referendums, including pro- and antihomosexual marriage votes and a bid to change the
name under which Taiwan competes at international sports events, which agitated China.
A total of ten questions appeared on the ballot. Under Taiwanese law, a total of 280,000
signatures (1.5% of eligible voters) were required for a question to be considered by the
Central Election Commission (CEC) and presented to voters. Five of the questions reviewed
and approved by the CEC concerned LGBT rights, LGBT sex education and same-sex
marriage.

users who violate China’s broad internet laws is difficult for the government to carry out;
