ABSTRACT

13

Plant molecular farming (PMF) is a convenient and cost-effective way to produce high-value

14

recombinant proteins that can be used in the production of a range of health products, from

15

pharmaceutical therapeutics to cosmetic products. New plant breeding techniques (NPBTs) provide a

16

means to enhance PMF systems more quickly and with greater precision than ever before. However,

17

the feasibility, regulatory standing and social acceptability of both PMF and NPBTs are in question.

18

This paper explores the perceptions of key stakeholders on two European Union (EU) Horizon 2020

19

programmes – Pharma-Factory and Newcotiana – towards the barriers and facilitators of PMF and

20

NPBTs in Europe. One-on-one qualitative interviews were undertaken with N=20 individuals involved

21

in one or both of the two projects at 16 institutions in seven countries (Belgium, France, Germany,

22

Italy, Israel, Spain and the UK). The findings indicate that the current EU regulatory environment and

23

the perception of the public towards biotechnology are seen as the main barriers to scaling-up PMF

24

and NPBTs. Competition from existing systems and the lack of plant-specific regulations likewise

25

present challenges for PMF developing beyond its current niche. However, respondents felt that the

26

communication of the benefits and purpose of NPBT PMF could provide a platform for improving the

27

social acceptance of genetic modification. The importance of the media in this process was

28

highlighted. This article also uses the multi-level perspective to explore the ways in which NPBTs are

March 2020
29

being legitimated by interested parties and the systemic factors that have shaped and are continuing

30

to shape the development of PMF in Europe.

INTRODUCTION

34

Plants offer a convenient and cost-effective expression system for the production of high-value

35

recombinant proteins (1). Plant molecular farming (PMF) has been used to produce monoclonal

36

antibodies the targeting HIV, Rabies and Ebola viruses (2–5). PMF can also been used for the

37

production of nanoparticles for biomedical use (6,7) and compounds for cosmetic purposes (8–10).

38

These are often referred to as plant-made (or plant-derived) pharmaceuticals, plant-made industrials,

39

biopharmaceuticals or biologics. For simplicity, the term plant-made pharmaceuticals (PMPs) is used

40

in this article.

March 2020
41

The demand for such high-value molecules has grown and continues to rise, sometimes outstripping

42

supply from existing protein expression systems that rely on yeast, bacterial and mammalian cell

43

cultures (11). Plants have several advantages over these protein expression systems, namely: (i) lower

44

production costs; (ii) low risk of contamination with human pathogens; (iii) scalability of cultivation;

45

(iv) and expertise and infrastructure in place for the production of plant material (9,12–15).

46

At the same time, recent advances in biotechnology are finding plant breeding applications. These are

47

collectively known as new plant breeding techniques (NPBTs) and can be used to produce improved

48

crop varieties that would be difficult to obtain by using traditional breeding methods or transgenic

49

modification (16,17). The CRISPR-Cas9 system, for example, has already been used to improve the

50

efficacy of Nicotiana tabacum and N. benthamiana as PMF platforms (18,19), with CRISPR offering the

51

possibility for rapid development of plant-based protein expression using generic recipient lines for

52

desired recombinant DNA (20).

53

Despite the potential of PMF to impact global health (21) and NPBTs to improve PMF expression

54

systems, previous research has identified several non-technical barriers to the development of these

55

technologies.

56

Newcotiana & Pharma-Factory

57

Two separate but complimentary Horizon 2020 projects include work packages to explore the social,

58

economic and environmental issues associated with PMF and NPBTs in the EU and contribute to the

59

responsible development of these innovations.

60

The Pharma-Factory project (https://pharmafactory.org) is coordinated by St George’s University of

61

London and involves 14 institutions (13 in EU member states and one in Israel). The project aims to

62

resolve the technical, social and economic bottlenecks for PMF. It takes a product-led approach with

63

five small to medium enterprises (SMEs) involved in the production of medical, veterinary and

64

diagnostic products – it also aims to involve all relevant stakeholders in the process of developing

65

these platforms, including scientists, representatives of PMF businesses and the public at large. The

66

public engagement work-package of the Pharma-Factory project places particular emphasis on

67

facilitating communication between these groups (22), public engagement and understanding barriers

68

to social acceptance.

69

The Newcotiana project (https://newcotiana.org) is coordinated by Consejo Superior de

70

Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC) in Spain and involves 19 institutions (18 in EU member states and

71

one in Australia). The programme of work focuses on the application of NPBTs to improving the

72

tobacco plant (N. tabacum) and its relative (N. benthamiana) as PMF platforms. It is hoped that these

March 2020
73

efforts will lead to the tobacco plant becoming a model crop for a variety of PMP targets, which would

74

in turn lead to shorter development times for new products and testing. The public engagement work-

75

package of the Newcotiana project aims to engage the public as well as relevant stakeholders to

76

determine barriers and facilitators of PMF, with a particular emphasis on understanding attitudes

77

towards NPBTs.

78

To provide context for these work packages, scoping research was undertaken to develop an

79

understanding of the perceived barriers and facilitators of PMF amongst key stakeholders (i.e. those

80

involved in research and development of PMF platforms). Future work expands on this approach by

81

involving wider groups of stakeholders and the public.

82

Plant molecular farming

83

The use of plants as platforms for the expression of recombinant proteins was first demonstrated in

84

the late 1980s and early 1990s – primarily with the tobacco plant (23–25). It would take over a decade

85

for the first commercial product to be launched (8), but since that time a large number of products

86

have been commercialised or are in development (9,26). Today, PMF relies on a number of methods

87

for protein expression: (i) stable nuclear transformation of a crop species that will be grown in a field

88

or glasshouse; (ii) stable plastid transformation of a crop species; (iii) transient transformation of a

89

crop species in containment; and (iv) stable transformation of a plant species that is grown

90

hydroponically such that the protein is secreted into the medium and recovered (12). Each method

91

has its strengths and weaknesses, depending on target molecule. The short timescales required to

92

produce large amounts of protein via transient expression makes it suitable for products with irregular

93

demand or unstable markets (9,27). The stable transformation of crop species takes much more time,

94

but represents the most scalable production method (9) – and potentially the most controversial from

95

a social perspective. PMF represents the third ‘generation’ of genetically modified (GM) plants: first-

96

generation crops were bred for productivity, second-generation crops for food quality and third-

97

generation crops for the production of PMPs and industrial purposes (28,29).

98

Four factors differentiate PMF from the older, first-generation biotechnology paradigm:

99

1) Purpose: the aim of PMF differs from the plant breeding of food and feed crops for direct

100

consumption by humans or animals (30).

101

2) Non-food status of (some) PMF platforms: the use of non-food/feed crops such as tobacco

102

may limit the risk of gene transfer to food crops (31) and reduce public concern over

103

contamination (30,32).

March 2020
104

3) Transient expression: proteins of interest are extracted without modifying the germline of

105

plant (instead only modifying the bacteria that infects the plant). These molecules are

106

produced in contained facilities, which may reduce concerns over contamination (31,33).

107

4) New plant breeding techniques: NPBTs differ from first-generation transgenic breeding

108

techniques in terms of precision and, in some cases, do not result in products that contain

109

transgenic material (16,34).

110

Despite these factors, PMF is still in the process of gaining the social acceptability currently enjoyed

111

by rival expression systems (11).

112

New Plant Breeding Techniques

113

New plant breeding techniques are a collection of specific biotechnologies that have largely emerged

114

over the last two decades (35). These include site-specific nuclease (SSN) technologies, such as the

115

CRISPR-Cas9 and zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), so named due to their ability to modify target genomes

116

at designated points. These techniques are also known as gene editing/engineering and permit

117

cisgenesis (breeding plants using only genetic material native to that species or from a sexually

118

compatible relative) and intragenesis (using only genes native to a particular species or close relative,

119

but in novel combinations).

120

Whilst NPBTs often rely on an initial transgenic “step”, these techniques can produce plants with no

121

final transgenic material that are indistinguishable from those bred by conventional breeding

122

approaches (16,34,36,37). Crucially, gene editing is viewed by experts as a significant departure from

123

earlier plant biotechnology because it permits the inactivation of endogenous genes, precise

124

conversion of alleles and the insertion of whole genetic elements from close relatives (38). As such,

125

NPBTs have renewed the debate about how to regulate biotechnology by creating a ‘grey area’ for

126

plant breeding legislation (22).

127

In the EU, NPBTs have fallen under the umbrella of existing (first-generation, transgenic) GM

128

legislation (2001/18/EC) (39,40); the decision of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in 2018 that

129

directed mutagenesis is covered by this regulation has caused concern amongst the European

130

scientific community over the impact to biotechnology investment and commercialisation prospects

131

(41,42). In the United States and other countries in the Americas, crops bred with NPBTs have found

132

relatively quick routes to market where regulation is no stricter than for conventionally-bred crops

133

(43). These have included crops with targeted gene ‘knockouts’, such as a non-browning mushroom

134

with reduced polyphenol oxidase production (44). The alternate regulatory ‘triggers’ in the EU and in

135

the USA represent the two broad pathways to regulating modified crops (39): process- and product-

March 2020
136

based regulation. A process-based regulatory trigger responds to crops produced by specific

137

technologies, as in the EU (39). A product-based regulatory trigger responds to products with specific,

138

often “novel” characteristics, such as transgenes. In practice, the two pathways are both subject to

139

considerable local variations and exemptions, which Eckerstorfer et al. (39) argue will prevent

140

international harmonisation in the near future.

141

The regulatory debate intersects the wider issue of social acceptability and whether the regulatory

142

approach to NPBTs should address public concerns over the risks of biotechnology or, where these

143

are considered to be divergent, be based purely on known environmental risks of such biotechnology

144

(45,46). Malyska et al. (46) argue that EU legislation on the cultivation of GM crops was driven largely

145

by public concerns about risk (see also 47), rather than by the interpretation of scientific evidence.

146

Various theories have been proposed to explain public reaction to biotechnology in Europe, such as

147

the ‘knowledge deficit’ model, which suggests that it is a lack of knowledge about science leads to

148

resistance against it. Some authors have argued that a lack of sufficient information about

149

biotechnology has led to consumers relying on the advice of ‘other’ stakeholders such as consumer

150

and environmental organisations in the past (47). However, this model is not without its criticisms

151

(48,49). Some studies have found no association between information deficits and acceptance (50).

152

Others have found that social trust is more important than knowledge with respect to public

153

perceptions of new technology (51). Besley et al. (52), for example, show an increase in negative

154

attitudes towards scientific studies that include large commercial partners.

155

Certain EU directives (2005/412) have meant that member states can unilaterally ‘opt-out’ of GM crop

156

cultivation (53). The ECJ’s 2018 ruling on NPBTs could lead to member states employing this opt-out

157

for NPBT-bred crops in the future, with implications for PMF. Yet questions remain over the social

158

acceptability of PMPs from NPBT plants: do consumers know or care how these are derived?

159

Ultimately, whilst there has been a substantial academic effort to understand stakeholder and public

160

attitudes towards first-generation GM food and feed crops, much less has been done with regards to

161

PMF – and less still at the intersection of PMF and NPBTs, which has only emerged as a technological

162

pairing in recent years.

163

The Multi-level Perspective

164

As NPBTs test existing European regulation on GM crops, PMF tests regulation that concerns the

165

production of pharmaceuticals (54,55). Some commentators have argued that PMPs are constrained

166

by existing regulation designed for cell culture technology that does not account for the distinct

167

advantages of plant-based expression systems (56). Technological trajectories are often restricted by

March 2020
168

current standards and past choices that in turn result in new technologies being “locked out” of a

169

market, independent of the inherent qualities of the technologies themselves (57–59).

170

One theoretical framework to understand how new technologies emerge and begin to challenge the

171

existing socio-technical regime – in this case, bacterial and mammalian protein expression systems –

172

is the multi-level perspective (MLP). MLP proposes that ‘niches’ represent spaces in which to develop

173

new technology that are isolated in some way from normal market pressures, such as university

174

laboratories (60). Niche-innovations are often carried and developed by small networks of what Geels

175

& Schot call ‘dedicated actors’ (61), of which the PMF community makes an interesting case study.

176

An example of this is the ZMapp Ebola virus vaccine (Mapp Biopharmaceutical), developed in tobacco

177

(N. benthamiana) to respond to the 2014 Ebola Crisis in West Africa (4); the lack of cell culture

178

alternatives and speed of protein acquisition provided an ideal space in which to demonstrate the

179

effectiveness of PMF (62–64).

180

A further unit of analysis in MLP is the landscape; this is the slow-changing, macro-level environment

181

in which regimes sit. Changes in the landscape – such as policies supporting “greener” industrial

182

processes, for example – can exert pressure on the regime, creating opportunities for niche-

183

innovations to gain market share and change existing modes of business.

184

The somewhat slow development of PMF products since the idea was first proposed in the 1980s may

185

be explained by a lack of landscape-level pressure (64). Dolfsma & Leydesdorff (59) point out that

186

technologies can break out of such conditions if a ‘third’ (i.e. non-market and non-technological) factor

187

can “unpick” the lock of the existing regime. For PMF, this could be plant-specific regulations or

188

protocols. Until such regulation is developed, there will be a disincentive for commercial development

189

of (some) PMPs (56). One means by which favourable policy can be advanced is through legitimation;

190

this is the process by which actors frame issues in a way that confers legitimacy to their actions or

191

technologies, often by creating positive discourses around their innovation (60). In the case of PMF,

192

this often relies on comparisons with existing protein expression systems (e.g. plants being cheaper

193

or more scalable) and the opportunities to improve health outcomes in low- and middle-income

194

countries (see 65).

195

There is a need to understand how these factors could influence future health outcomes. This article

196

describes a qualitative scoping study with key PMF experts, which helped guide the development of

197

follow-on research for Newcotiana and Pharma-Factory projects public engagement work.

March 2020
198

The research questions framing this initial scoping study were: what are the barriers and facilitators

199

of PMF and NPBTs in Europe? How are PMF products perceived by experts and how might they be

200

perceived by end-users? How have PMF experts engaged with the public about these technologies?

201

It is hoped that this study will contribute to ongoing discussions about the future of PMF and emerging

202

debates about the appropriate regulation of NPBTs, as well as provide an initial framework for

203

understanding the development of both technologies through the multi-level perspective.

204

METHODOLOGY

205

The methodology of the study involves two overlapping parts of the Pharma-Factory and Newcotiana

206

engagement work. Both studies focused on gaining an understanding of the opinions of stakeholders

207

towards the risks and opportunities of PMF and NPBTs and what might constitute barriers and

208

facilitators to the ongoing development of these technologies. An applied qualitative approach was

209

employed; the need to understand varied social phenomena necessitated an in-depth understanding

210

of the topic. Qualitative research can provide four classifications of information (66):

211

1. Contextual: describing what exists

212

2. Explanatory: examining the reasons for and relationships between what exists

213

3. Evaluative: appraising the effectiveness of what exists

214

4. Generative: supporting the development of theories, strategies and actions

215

Each of these categories is important for understanding the barriers and facilitators for scaling-up

216

PMF. Firstly, a contextual understanding of the practicalities of developing PMF products is required

217

to situate subsequent information. Secondly, explanatory accounts of support for or opposition to

218

genetic modification, for example, are important. The evaluation of how well PMF platforms are

219

performing and the perceived suitability of the regulatory environment in which they currently

220

operate will likewise be valuable. Lastly, generative accounts of possible facilitation mechanisms will

221

provide a basis for future work on the Pharma-Factory and Newcotiana projects.

222

Semi-structured interviews with key consortium stakeholders

223

Semi-structured one-on-one interviews were chosen as the most suitable method of data generation

224

for this study on the basis that they can provide the level of depth required to explore each the

225

categories described above. Semi-structured interviews allow the researcher to probe interesting lines

226

of inquiry during the interview in a flexible manner (67).

March 2020
227

An interview guide was developed for each study (available in the project repositories). These were

228

created following consultation with the relevant literature on PMF and NPBTs respectively. An

229

interview guide helps the interviewer structure the interview by orientating it around topics relevant

230

to the study aims (68). In the case of Newcotiana, the interview guide concerned: 1) the risks and

231

benefits of using NPBTs to modify Nicotiana lines 2) personal and public perceptions of NPBTs and 3)

232

participation in public engagement activities. For Pharma-Factory, the interview guide was focused

233

on: 1) perceptions of plant-derived products, 2) key stakeholders and end-users for PMPs and 3)

234

experience with stakeholder and end-user engagement. Information about the participant’s current

235

role, background and research activities was also taken, in order to contextualise their responses.

236

The sampling frame for this study can be described as purposive (69). The inclusion criteria were: 1)

237

the individual must have experience in developing PMF platforms and 2) be associated with either the

238

Pharma-Factory and/or Newcotiana projects. Individuals at the universities and businesses belonging

239

to the two consortiums were approached (by email) for involvement in the study. Only consortium

240

partners not directly involved in the development of PMF platforms were excluded from the study.

241

The sampling frame was chosen to provide a relatively quick overview of the ‘state of play’ in PMF and

242

NPBTs within these two large European projects.

243

Interviews were audio recorded and transcribed by a private company adhering to the UK Data

244

Protection Act and General Data Protection Regulations of the European Union.

245

Potential participants were informed of their prospective invitations to these informal interviews

246

during the grant preparation phase. Audio consent was taken prior to the interview. Participants of

247

Pharma-Factory interviews were also invited to correct their transcripts individually for errors and to

248

ensure no commercially or otherwise sensitive data was collected. All project partners were

249

approached for comment on this article prior to submission. Ethical approval for Newcotiana and

250

Pharma-Factory public engagement work package activities was given by the St George’s Research

251

Ethics Committee (refs: SGREC18.0006; SGREC2018.0143).

252

Data analysis

253

The data analysis was undertaken in accordance with Framework Analysis, a thematic approach

254

developed by Jane Ritchie and Liz Spencer for large-scale policy work (66). It is designed for instances

255

in which there are specific questions, a pre-designated sample (often professionals in a given domain),

256

limited timeframes and known a priori issues (70). An initial coding framework was developed by three

257

researchers for both datasets via line-by-line open coding, after which subsequent transcripts were

258

coded and indexed using NVivo 12 for Windows.

March 2020
259

The coding and development of analytical themes was conducted separately for each of the studies

260

before a secondary, combined analysis was undertaken by cross-referencing analytical themes and

261

supporting evidence. This approach allowed for exploration of the complementarities and potential

262

differences in the data, which are outlined below. A list of codes and supporting data are provided

263

alongside this article in the project repositories.

264

FINDINGS

265

Between April and May 2018, Jonathan Menary (PhD) and Sara Mesquita de Albuquerque (MSc), both

266

research assistants with experience in qualitative interviewing, conducted 21 separate interviews with

267

participants (17 participants were interviewed by video conferencing or telephone and four were

268

interviewed face-to-face). In total, 51 people were approached for interview. Those that did not

269

respond to requests for interview after two emails were considered to have refused to participate.

270

One participant was present in both samples (due to representation on both projects) – 13 (61.9%;

271

13/21) were men and seven (33.3 %; 7/21) were women. Six participants (28.6%; 6/21) represented

272

SMEs, being businesses with less than 250 employees (one VP, two CEOs and two research scientists),

273

six (28.6%; 6/21) were researchers at universities (three professors, two senior researchers and one

274

project manager) and eight (38% 8/21) were researchers at public research institutions (four

275

professors, three senior researchers and one PhD student). Interviews lasted between 20-40 minutes

276

for Newcotiana and 54-96 minutes for Pharma-Factory. No respondents refused to answer any topic

277

of enquiry that was posed to them.

278

In this section, the key findings of the research are outlined with reference to three key themes that

279

have emerged. Similar themes were identified in each study, with discussions around NPBTs being

280

somewhat dominant. The findings are presented in a combined manner, but differences between the

281

projects are noted where relevant.

282

The need for (careful) communication

283

For the researchers and companies working in the field of PMF and plant breeding, communication

284

with others – particularly the public – was considered to key to improving the acceptability of the

285

technology:

286

“… what we need to do is come to the public and explain to the public that… breeding is even worse

287

than genetic modification. I’m not sure that the common regular person in the house is familiar with

288

the real facts.” – Pharma-Factory SME representative (1)

March 2020
289

A key finding showed that communicative activities often involved ‘contrast’, most commonly

290

between NPBTs and conventional breeding techniques, which, in the case of mutagenesis, researchers

291

stressed could be far less precise than NPBTs:

292

“The previous technology was like shotguns. Now we are using a laser to do exactly the same.” –

293

Newcotiana researcher (6)

294

There was an assumption that the more information the public had about these technologies, the

295

greater would be its support for their development:

296

“So when you explain to them these kinds of things, they are usually ready to accept such kind of

297

production.” – Pharma-Factory researcher (5)

298

The same is true for PMF in general, where a need for contrast with existing protein expression

299

systems was perceived to be an advantage for “greener”, plant-based production:

300

“… [plant molecular farming] is our interest, because getting products coming from plants is like… a

301

green source, so that’s completely okay and complies with our aim in the cosmetic industry.” –

302

Newcotiana cosmetic company representative (1)

303

Furthermore, effective communication of the benefits of PMF, including the potential lower cost of

304

plant-based expression and the need to focus on the products it can provide, was considered to be

305

important for the future of the technology:

306

“I’m really, really emphasising making pharmaceuticals, because the alternative is quite expensive.” –

307

Newcotiana researcher (3)

308

“… we shouldn’t spend so much time on technicalities… this won’t reach out very much to the general

309

public. If you can show that the products that are done by these techniques are interesting, then that

310

might be all that people care about.” – Newcotiana researcher (5)

311

Although this view contradicts the assumption that providing more information about biotechnology

312

(necessarily) leads to greater support for it, there was a perception that the purpose of PMPs would

313

improve the acceptability of genetic modification:

314

“…[modification] has a negative picture but if you use it for production of pharmaceuticals then it

315

completely changes.” – Newcotiana researcher (1)

316

There were reservations amongst several scientists about the extent to which lay people would be

317

able to fully appreciate what were described as “academic” differences between NPBTs and the first-

318

generation GM techniques that have caused controversy in the EU:

March 2020
319

“I don’t’ believe that people will [see] a big difference between GMO and new plant breeding

320

techniques. In their minds, it’s more of this whole modern stuff, modern genetic manipulation.” –

321

Newcotiana researcher (5)

322

One participant described a need for a “blockbuster success” in PMF to increase public awareness of

323

the technology. In providing information about NPBTs and PMF, the media was held to be the most

324

important actor(s), capable of shaping the public’s image of these emerging technologies. It was also

325

suggested that environmental non-governmental organisations (NGOs) would oppose NPBTs, even for

326

biopharmaceutical crops, based on historical responses to GM technology in food:

327

“One of the main reasons Golden Rice has been sitting on the shelf for ten years is because

328

organisations such as Greenpeace came out and said ‘we cannot allow Golden Rice to go out because

329

if we allow one product the floodgates will open’. As far as Greenpeace is concerned… there is no

330

difference between molecular farming, mutational improvement, agronomic traits, or anything else.

331

They would always, in my opinion, maintain this position - against.” – Pharma-Factory researcher (9)

332

There was also concern that the combination of genetic modification and the tobacco plant could add

333

to the stigma around an already stigmatised crop for the potential growers of PMF crops. However,

334

many more participants observed that PMF could actively improve the image of the tobacco plant

335

should it be used in the production of pharmaceutical products:

336

“I think less controversial definitely, definitely. I think that now the uses of tobacco are 99% smoking.

337

That is something that is not good for your health… and the aim of this project is to have a new-cotiana,

338

a new tobacco that changes completely the scope and the uses, instead of being for smoking it's used

339

for more positive applications.” – Newcotiana researcher (2)

340

In summary, a strong emphasis was placed on the importance of communication with the public in

341

particular. Engagement of the media was seen to be paramount for enabling positive communications

342

about PMF. Many participants embraced the need for communication with the public by speaking on

343

public radio and at schools. There was a perception that a focus on products – and their benefits –

344

was an important focus for these communications. However, it was also suggested that opposition to

345

the use of NPBTs would persist amongst certain groups regardless of purpose.

346

Regulatory environments tied to existing systems and definitions

347

The technical requirements of PMF are strictly tied to both current regulation and existing protein

348

expression systems. These current systems form a benchmark for quality assessment, yet were also

349

seen as a significant barrier:

March 2020
350

“… it’s really easy and very clear what we need to demonstrate in order to be competitive. You need

351

to demonstrate that you can produce to the same quality and the same quality standards set by for

352

example the pharmaceutical and food industry. It’s quite clear. It’s certain ISO regulations, it’s the

353

GMP [good manufacturing practice] regulations.” – PharmaFactory SME representative (3)

354

“But the CHO cells and bacteria are so established and there are so many examples where processes

355

have been approved by the regulatory agencies… it's completely different with plants.” – Newcotiana

356

researcher (1)

357

The lukewarm attitude of big pharmaceutical companies towards new sources of PMPs was likewise

358

noted as a potential barrier to the support for PMF:

359

“There had been a lot of resistance amongst the big pharmaceutical companies to actually bring on

360

line another production technology because they felt that that would compete with their gold

361

standard, which was transgenic mammalian cells in fermenters… perhaps this is one of the reasons

362

you haven't seen more than one or two products of plant molecular farming on the market. And still

363

big pharma is, at best, neutral; in a worst case scenario, skeptical or even ambivalent about a plant

364

production system.” – PharmaFactory researcher (9)

365

Plants were also promoted as a potentially safer platform for the production of PMPs:

366

“… the product will be safer if it’s produced in plants, because viruses in plants are not infecting

367

humans.” – Pharma-Factory SME representative (5)

368

It was suggested that the use of controlled environments for PMP production could improve their

369

regulatory standing and, it was also assumed, the social acceptability of genetic modification:

370

“The major difference is, first GM food is done in the open field, with all the risks that you have. So

371

plant molecular pharmaceutical is in containment… and the other thing is they know they will get sick

372

and they will need medicine.” – Pharma-Factory researcher (4)

373

If regulatory hurdles can be overcome, then competition from existing systems remains, though it was

374

noted that PMF will compete best in niches for which no alternative protein expression systems exist:

375

“Because the field of protein production is quite competitive and so far plants only cover a niche within

376

this whole market. And are not really competitive to other systems like microbial cells or mammalian

377

cells.” – Newcotiana researcher (1)

378

The regulation of NPBTs was also of concern for participants, hinging on the classification of genetic

379

modification:

March 2020
380

“In order to make gene editing, you have to introduce CRIPSPR-Cas protein, plus these guide RNA. And

381

one easy way to do it is to make a transgenic plant with the CRISPR-Cas gene, plus the transgenic RNA

382

gene. And that’s transgenic. There is no doubt about it. And then you cross these out and you remain

383

with a mutation. But as the European legislation works by pedigree… anything that has been

384

transgenic once is, according to the European legislation, is transgenic forever. Even, if the transgene

385

is not [there anymore].” – Newcotiana researcher (5)

386

In summary, there is evidence of both certainty and uncertainty around the regulatory environment.

387

Certain existing systems provide both a benchmark for PMPs and source of direct competition. It is

388

not clear to practitioners whether PMF will be considered for a distinctive regulatory pathway, nor

389

how NPBTs will be regulated in the future.

390

Legitimation of new plant breeding techniques

391

A further conceptual theme that related to the legitimation of NPBTs was identified. Participants

392

pointed to various justifications for their use, such as by appealing to the long history of domestication

393

and cultivation of various crop plants by humans:

394

“I [would] like [the public] to be able to put it in the context of all the breeding that has been done, is

395

doing, being done and have done for centuries… people, both farmers and general public to understand

396

that this, the changes produced are the same that we have been producing for many years, it's only

397

the tools we use are different and are more effective.” – Newcotiana researcher (2)

398

NPBTs were also considered to mimic more “natural” processes, such as gene silencing and knockouts:

399

“I would say new plant breeding techniques, it’s no different to the natural variation… just making base

400

pair mutations to, for example in my case that knock-down gene. So those single base pair [mutations]

401

will occur, they can occur in nature.” – Newcotiana researcher (3)

402

In turn, these arguments fed into debates about the appropriate regulatory response by the EU

403

towards NPBTs:

404

“How should we do it, what should be the risk? How should we be able to regulate such things if you

405

cannot prove this thing is different from a natural plant?” – Newcotiana researcher (6)

406

In conclusion, the use of NPBTs is being legitimated by (pre-) history, precision and naturalness.

407

Interview themes across both projects overlapped considerably, though more emphasis was placed

408

on products and processes amongst the Pharma-Factory cohort and a greater focus on public

409

perception of NPBTs within the Newcotiana cohort.

DISCUSSION

411

In this section, the findings are discussed with reference to the wider literature around plant molecular

412

farming, biotechnology and technological transitions. The results of the study have confirmed several

413

previous findings. The need for plant-specific policies to support PMF, for example, has been noted by

414

other commentators (56). Some authors have also pointed to a need for blockbuster successes in PMF

415

(64), an observation echoed here. The need for these elements of technological development appears

416

to be well-described by the multi-level perspective, demonstrating its effectiveness at describing the

417

factors that shape the trajectory of new technologies. More surprising are the ways in which NPBTs

418

are being legitimated by experts and, in particular, the extent to which this legitimation is rooted in

419

past debates about plant breeding.

420

Public perception of biotechnology and communication

421

The findings suggest that communication is a vital component for the development of PMF and NPBTs;

422

there appears to be an almost inextricable link between the two at this level. Given the scale of debate

423

about biotechnology in Europe, public perception of the risks and benefits of these new technologies

424

(and their regulation) remains the first major obstacle for NPBT-bred PMPs. The extent to which public

425

opinion about biotechnology currently shape the regulatory stance of EU legislative structures is

426

debatable. However, in the case of GM food, public discourse has had a significant impact on the

427

regulatory process (47) and it is through newspapers, television and the internet that people form

428

their first impressions of new technologies and the risks around them (46,71). As such, our

429

participants’ concerns over communication of PMF and NPBTs – and the role of the media in mediating

430

early perceptions of new technology – appears to be well-founded.

431

The sometimes-contradictory views expressed in our findings with respect to what and how to

432

communicate biotechnology information mirror the intricacy of the relevant literature. The assertion

433

that “more information” about NPBTs would lead to greater acceptance, for example, suggests that

434

some participants subscribe to the knowledge deficit model. As Sturgis & Allum (48) note: “implicit in

435

this programmatic agenda is the claim that ‘to know science is to love it’”. Yet participants themselves

436

also displayed a deficit of knowledge when it comes to research on public attitudes towards science.

437

Most cited knowledge as a major barrier (i.e. the public do not have enough) rather than, for example,

438

negative views towards commercial involvement in scientific studies (52).

439

As for the concern that the public would not see the “academic” differences between older forms of

440

genetic modification and NPBTs, survey data of European consumers shows that cisgenic breeding is

441

more acceptable than transgenic breeding (72,73), suggesting the public is capable of understanding

March 2020
442

this distinction. Opinions vary across EU member states, however, and have been shown to be tied

443

more closely to purpose and potential benefit (73). Connor & Siegrist (51) also find that perceived

444

benefit and risk are more significant determinants of public opinion than knowledge, a claim also

445

made by some participants in this study. As such, providing consumers with sufficient and relevant

446

information about biotechnology to make informed choices based on potential benefits and risks

447

should be promoted (47); this view likewise re-orientates the emphasis from (public) knowledge

448

deficits to better science communication and perhaps new forms of public engagement that align with

449

the need for more responsible research and innovation (see 74).

450

The benefits of PMF are perhaps inherently easier to communicate than those of NPBTs, though taken

451

together third-generation GM crops offer direct benefit to consumers, which Breithaupt (75) argues

452

could improve public perception of biotechnology (and their regulatory standing). The perception of

453

direct personal benefit appears to increase acceptance of genetic modified food crops (76). Many

454

benefits of first-generation GM crops are found ‘upstream’ of the consumer (herbicide tolerance and

455

insect resistance) rather than in aspects of food quality easily perceptible to the wider public (77). As

456

Sparrow et al. (78) note: “the early (agricultural) products from large biotechnology companies were

457

mistrusted and directly benefitted farmers but not consumers”. Others see the benefits of GM food

458

accruing to only the large multinational agri-businesses that patent the crops in question (79). The

459

ability for NPBTs to provide downstream benefits, such as high-value medical molecules, is therefore

460

an important factor for understanding social acceptance now and in the future.

461

PMF regulation and the socio-technical regime

462

In general, participants were explicit about what manufacturing standards needed to be met for new

463

PMF products to be successful (i.e. current GMP guidelines). The advantages of plant-based protein

464

production described by participants are not necessarily being realised yet, due to the need to meet

465

GMP guidelines, which have been developed with bacterial and mammalian cell cultures in mind

466

rather than being inclusive of plants (54,55). Our findings also suggest that significant prior investment

467

in existing systems by firms may be deterring interest in PMF platforms (63,see 80).

468

The observation that plants occupy several niches in which they do not directly compete with

469

established protein expression systems is also important; according to the MLP, these niches

470

represent proving grounds for PMF and permit the growth of early “blockbuster successes” (64) that

471

participants believed would be required to raise PMF in the public consciousness.

472

The findings also confirm a lack of landscape-level pressure on the existing regime. However, certain

473

changes could provide opportunities for PMF to become a more established protein expression

March 2020
474

system, such as subsidies for PMPs, greater emphasis on quick production times (63) and promotion

475

of PMF as a ‘greener’ sources of medical molecules (81). These initiatives would also align with the

476

EU’s overarching ‘Bioeconomy Strategy’, which promotes greener sources of industrial products (82).

477

Yet the ability to produce these molecules rapidly could simply serve to reinforce the regime by

478

providing a fast form of pharmaceutical testing that precedes cell culture batch production (63). A

479

desire for greener products (as promoted by one participant) could put pressure on existing protein

480

expression systems, but this assumption has several problems: 1) it assumes that consumers are

481

familiar with how pharmaceuticals are currently produced, 2) that PMF is demonstrably more

482

environmentally-friendly than existing bioreactors and 3) it leaves the concept of PMF open to

483

criticism from those who have previously advocated against the diversion of food crops for other uses,

484

as occurred with biofuels in the EU (see 83). The avoidance of food crops (e.g. using tobacco instead)

485

and the use of containment facilities circumvents this problem, but open-field PMF might be

486

considered non-green where land suitable for food production is used for the production of non-food

487

crops. Other landscape-level pressures that could work against PMF include public acceptance of the

488

technology and the use of NPBTs, as described above.

489

Legitimation of NPBTs

490

The findings demonstrate how experts are legitimating the use of NPBTs. Arguments for the more

491

lenient regulation of NPBTs, for example, rest on their precision and ability to induce changes in plant

492

genomes that are equivalent to natural processes (such as gene silencing); the same arguments are

493

used throughout the literature on NPBTs (84–86). Parallels were also drawn with existing plant

494

breeding techniques, particularly chemical and radiative mutagenesis, which were described as plant

495

breeding’s “shotgun” to the NPBT “laser”. Of course, an appeal to the precision of NPBTs places

496

emphasis on process and not product, despite calls for the use of a product-based regulatory trigger

497

for NPBT-bred plants in Europe (37).

498

Myskja et al. (87) argue that scientists do not see ‘naturalness’ as relevant to the debate about the

499

ethics of plant breeding; the invocation of naturalness in our sample may be an appeal to the

500

presumed perceptions of a public, that, at least in the EU, does see naturalness as important (72). The

501

mimicry of natural processes lead Eriksson & Ammann (86) to argue that genome editing can facilitate

502

a transition in perception of what is natural in plant breeding by situating it (conceptually) between

503

transgenic techniques and more conventional breeding. NPBTs were also described as simply the most

504

recent of a series of technological advances that connect the Agricultural Revolution (and plant

505

domestication) to plant breeding today.

March 2020

506

PMF with tobacco

507

In general, the coupling of PMF and NPBTs with the tobacco plant was seen to provide an opportunity

508

to improve the image of tobacco. For US consumers, support for genetically modified tobacco was

509

contingent on societal good (88) – however, given the scale of debate in Europe over the use of GM

510

crops, further research is required to determine European attitudes towards PMF and whether it can

511

genuinely represent a bridge to greater social acceptance of these biotechnologies.

512

Limitations and areas for future research

513

The relative homogeneity of the participants in this study – predominantly (12/21; 57%) researchers

514

at universities and public research institutes – has several limitations. Whilst this is useful for providing

515

an understanding of the views that experts have of the immediate regulatory barriers for PMF and the

516

ways in which experts may or may not have engaged the public, they are not necessarily conversant

517

with the literature on public attitudes towards, for example, genetic modification. Likewise,

518

participants in this study were drawn from two H2020 projects, limiting the scope of the study to

519

Europe. Given differences in legislation and reported measures of public opinion between Europe and

520

the United States, for example, this work cannot be considered applicable to areas outside of Europe.

521

A key area for future research will involve determining the barriers and facilitators of PMF and NPBTs

522

in low- and middle-income countries, given the potential benefits of both to developing nations (see

523

65). There is also a need to move towards public engagement activities that bring various stakeholder

524

groups together in order to facilitate two-way communication. The Pharma-Factory project is taking

525

such an approach to the development of PMF (see https://pharmafactory.org).

526

CONCLUSIONS

527

This study has outlined an approach to identifying the barriers and facilitators for scaling-up PMF and

528

NPBTs using an applied qualitative framework. It has identified public perceptions of biotechnology,

529

the existing regulatory environment and competition from other protein expression systems as

530

explicit barriers to scaling-up PMF and NPBTs. This study has sought to contextualise these insights

531

within the wider literature around PMF and NPBTs and pointed towards useful conceptual frameworks

532

– such as MLP – that could help researchers understand the development of PMF in Europe. In

533

particular, the lack of plant-specific regulation, landscape-level pressure on the existing regime of

534

bacterial and mammalian protein expression systems and support from pharmaceutical companies

535

may confine PMF to ‘niches’ for the foreseeable future.

March 2020
536

This article has described a number of possible facilitation mechanisms, such as science

537

communication focused on the benefits and purpose of PMF, which our participants identified as

538

important in leading to an improvement in the perception of genetic modification of plants amongst

539

the public. The study has also shown how scientists and other interested parties are framing NPBTs to

540

legitimate more favourable regulation, relying primarily on arguments of precision, mimicry of natural

541

processes and plant breeding heritage.

542

Lessons of the past can yield important insights into the way forward through current challenges. The

543

main challenges at the intersection of PMF and NPBTs will likely be regulation and the opinions of

544

Europeans towards these technologies. As our participants have stated – and has been realised in the

545

past (e.g. GM crops) – these two topics are central to the scale-up of new technologies. The top-down

546

promotion of science and technology for its own sake has not always been persuasive and, as the

547

findings of this study indicate, scientists do not always appear to be aware of the wider literature on

548

acceptability. As such, there is a need for sufficient and relevant information about new technologies

549

alongside more active forms of public engagement that link both researchers and other stakeholders.

550

Hartley et al. (89) argue that new agricultural biotechnology represents an opportunity to re-evaluate

551

current governance systems – it is hoped that our work can contribute to the socially-responsible

552

governance of the emerging fields of PMF and NPBTs.

553
