Resilience, Adaptation and Expected Support for Food Security among the Malaysian
East Coast Poor Households

Abstract

Purpose: Sustainable food security at the household level is one of the emerging issues for all
nations. It is expected that the patterns of household resilience factors and adaptation
practices have a strong linkage with household food security. The aim of this study was to
seek an effective technique of adaptation for food security and the required types of support
for adaptation to food insecurity among the poor and low income households in Malaysia.
Design/methodology/approach: This study was based on primary data that were collected in
Jul-Oct 2012 through a questionnaire survey among 460 poor and low income households
from the Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu states of Malaysia. The samples were selected
from E-Kasih poor household database based on a two-stage cluster random sampling
technique. The study considered household food security as household food availability and
food accessibility, and ran ordinal regressions to find out the linkages of household food
security with household resilience factors, adaptation practices, and expected support for
adaptation to food security.
Findings: The study concludes that several resilience factors and adaptation practices were
statistically significant to household food security, and several external supports were
statistically and significantly needed to ensure household food security. Therefore, to ensure
sustainable household food security in Malaysia, the food security programs needs to be
integrated with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climatic changes adaptation
programs, and the involvement of relevant stakeholders are crucial.
Originality/value: This study is a pioneer work based on primary data that empirically
measured the linkages of household food security with household resilience factors,
adaptation practices, and expected support for adaptation to food security in Malaysia. This
study also discussed some issues related to the climate change linkage, which would help
future climate change research. The findings of the study will be beneficial for all the
stakeholders, including policy makers related to the food security and climate change
adaptation.

1. Introduction

Food security is a critical aspect of individual and household wellbeing regardless of whether
it is viewed globally, locally, or communally/. Hunger and food insecurity are detrimental to
the basic rights of a human being and are a prelude to the problems of health, nutrition, and
development. The main challenges to food security are political, economic, social,
infrastructural, demographic, livelihood strategies, etc. (Frankenberge, 1992; Cristofar &
Basiotis, 1992; Nyariki & Wiggins, 1997; Smith, 1998; Lovendal & Knowles, 2006; FAO,
2003, 2008; Alam et al., 2016b ). However, now-a-days, changes in the climatic factors and
their outcomes, such as natural calamities, are also considered another challenge to
sustainable food security (Alam et al., 2016b, 2017).

People facing food insecurity are mostly from the poor communities who are also
vulnerable to the potential effects of climate changes and have the least capability to adapt to
these situations (FAO, 2009; Siwar et al., 2009). Moreover, a study from FAO (2011) states
that, the major portion of poor people‟s income is spent on food. On the other hand, there are
still 836 million people in the world living in extreme poverty (United Nations, 2015), and at
least 70 percent of the very poor live in rural areas; most of them depend partly or completely
on agriculture for their livelihoods (IFAD, 2011). Since, FAO (2016) estimates that, to satisfy
the growing demand driven by population growth and diet changes, food production will
have to be increased by at least 60 percent in the next decades. However, world hunger is on
the rise; the estimated number of undernourished people has increased from 777 million in
2015 to 815 million in 2016 (FAO, 2017). Poor people who suffer from food insecurity and
low income households are economically deprived groups in the society as well as frequently
more exposed to natural disasters; in addition, they are exposed to highly reliant resources
that are climate-sensitive, and they have limited resources in terms of technology and
economy. Their adaptability to climatic and non-climatic food insecurity is dependent on
adaptation strategies that are based on socioeconomic and cultural factors, such as household
4

composition, gender, and household asset distribution, and from external institutions (FAO,
2006).

Strategies for adaptation to climate changes to establish food security could be
planned or autonomous. Planned adaptation includes the growth in adaptive capability by
utilizing policies and institutions to set up or strengthen favorable situations for effective
adaptation and new technologies and infrastructure investment (Yohe et al., 2007).
Autonomous adaptation involves the continuous implementation of current technology,
knowledge and adaptability in responding to the level of food insecurity (Easterling et al.,
2007). In most cases, autonomous adaptations are used by households, but they are
insufficient to deal with food insecurity; as a result, planned, strategic measures are required.

Strategies for adaptation to climatic or non-climatic food insecurity at household level
are complicated and frequently limited. According to Maxwell et al. (1999), in urban and
rural settings, there are four categories of coping strategies linked to food-search behaviors,
dietary change, household rationing, and structure that are normal methods adopted by
households facing food insufficiency. However, but the particular coping strategy inside each
category might differ across various settings. Based on various environmental situations
(such as rural versus urban culture, cost of living, employment status of women and
education), the low-income urban households may use various specific mechanisms to cope
with food insufficiency and income compared to rural households. Likewise, Davies (1996)
points out that different features of coping behaviors (sequence of importance or intensity,
definition, short-term and long-term changes) might vary between locations (e.g., rural versus
urban) and inside a particular location (agricultural versus fishing community in rural areas).

According to Shariff and Khor (2008), low-income rural households utilize foodrelated coping strategies (borrowing money to buy food and cook whatever food is available
at home) when they face food insecurity. Dore et al. (2003) suggested that using cheaper food
and eating at home were common coping strategies among Russian low-income households
to protect the children‟s dietary intakes. Reduced quantity and frequency of food intake,
affected diet and food quality; food preference and food substitution, food store changes,
borrowing food or money and sale of assets were the strategies used by Javanese families
during the economic crisis in 1998 in Indonesia (Studdert et al., 2001). Diversifying or
changing livelihood is also utilized for adaptation, such as via migration to search for
5

additional income sources or in some cases forcible sales of assets (Devereux, 2001; Ellis,
1998). Having access to healthcare is also a major concern in managing and controlling
diseases related to food security (Makinen et al., 2000).

Malaysia is a fast growing developing country. Therefore, there are scopes of frequent
changes in the macro variables and policies that would affect food security (Alam et al.,
2016c). Moreover, the climatic factors are changing rapidly in Malaysia and have been
exerting having adverse impacts on food production (Alam et al., 2010, 2011, 2012b). In this
country, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have increased by 290.7% during the period of
1990-2011 (IEA, 2013) and is included in the list of 30 largest greenhouse gas emitters.
Moreover, in 2016, CO2 emissions per capita for Malaysia was 8.53 metric tons with an
annual growth rate of 3.09%, and Malaysia is ranked 28th in the world (BP, 2018). Alam et
al., (2016b) also found significant direct and indirect impacts of climatic factors on household
food security. In the case of level of food security, among the low-income rural communities,
50% or more of the households face some level of food insecurity, reporting with 34.5% of
child hunger (Shariff & Khor, 2008). Studies also show different rates for urban and rural
households with food insecurity in Malaysia, such as the rate among the urban low-income
households, which is, at 66.6% (Zalilah, 1998) and 65.7% (Zalilah & Ang, 2001), and the rate
among rural low-income households at 58% (Shariff & Khor, 2008).

Therefore, understanding the adaptation ability of households to food insecurity,
effectiveness of the current strategies of adaptation to food insecurity, and determining the
required supports for adaptation to food insecurity are essential to offer a valuable tool for
planning and evaluating the achievement of Vision 2020. The understanding and the
determination would help Malaysia to become a fully developed nation by the year of 2020
with a view to increasing and improving food security and removing poverty and hunger in
Malaysia. Hence, this study is an attempt to conduct an in depth assessment on the available
resilience factors and the adaptation practices carried out by poor and low-income households
in East Coast Economic Region (ECER) to adapt to food insecurity, and the expected support
for adaptation to food insecurity.

2. Methodology

2.1 Study Area
6

For the empirical assessment, this study mostly relied on primary data collected through an
extensive questionnaire survey at the household level in the East Coast Economic Region
(ECER) in Malaysia. This study selected the ECER as the study area because the ECER
encompasses more than half of the Peninsular Malaysia with the area of about 66,000 sq
kilometers that covers the states of Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang, and the district of Mersing
in Johor (Figure 1). ECER is crucial for two major reasons: (a) ECER is the most vulnerable
area in Malaysia due to climatic changes; and (b) the income level in this region is low, and
the poverty rate is high, which is a hindrance to achieving Vision 2020 (Alam et al., 2012a;
ECER Master Plan. 2007, 2008). The population of ECER was about 3.95 million,
which represented 14.8% of the total population of Malaysia in 2005. In 2004, the incidences
of poverty were 10.6%, 4%, and 15.4% in Kelantan, Pahang, and Terengganu, respectively,
whereas for overall Malaysia, it was 5.7%. At the same time, the incidences of hardcore
poverty were 1.3%, 1.0%, and 4.4% in Kelantan, Pahang, and Terengganu respectively,
whereas for overall Malaysia, it was 1.2%. Moreover, there were about 45,000 paddy farmers
in the ECER, and the average productivity per worker was RM 11,915 whereas the national
agriculture productivity per worker was RM 15,355 (ECER Master Plan. 2007, 2008).

Figure 1: Location of Study Area (ECER-Malaysia)
Source: Alam et al., 2012a

ECER is mainly an agricultural region; as of 2004, all crops production covered a
total area of 2.22 million ha in the ECER (34.8% of Peninsular Malaysia). However, in 2008,
the government had officially launched a large development project, East Coast Economic

7

Region Development Project, to develop five key areas – manufacturing, oil, gas &
petrochemicals, tourism, agriculture, and human capital development. With the objective of
fast-forwarding the inflow of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and industrialization in the
region, ECER Special Economic Zone (ECER SEZ) and Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial
Park were initiated in this area. Therefore, the ECER was expected to implement projects
worth an estimated RM 112 billion in value by the year 2020. The ECER Special Economic
Zone (SEZ) was expected to generate up to RM 90 billion in investments and contribute RM
23 billion to the national Gross Domestic Product (GDP), as well as create 220,000 new jobs
out of the 560,000 jobs identified (ECER Master Plan. 2007, 2008).

2.2 Data Collection
The study followed the two-stage cluster random sampling technique. Initially the samples
were clustered by location and then by poverty category. Finally, from each category,
samples were picked randomly from the E-Kasih database, which is an integrated database
system that enlists poor households at the national level to plan, implement, and monitor
poverty programs. The urban area of Kuantan and the rural area of Pekan were selected from
the Pahang state. The urban area of Kota Bharu and the rural area of Tumpat were selected
from the Kelantan state. The urban area of Kuala Terengganu and rural area of Marang were
selected from the Terengganu state.

Based on the formula of required size of samples (Yamane, 1967: 886), first, 400
samples were selected according to the proportion of population distribution. However, to
ensure a good number of observations for each group, which was needed for sound statistical
analysis for any particular group, another 100 households were added to the sample.
However, while targeting the sample size to be 500, after collecting and validating the data,
finally, 460 households retained in the sample.

A structured interview based on a questionnaire was is used to collect data; the
respondents provided the answers and the enumerators filled -up the questionnaires. The
regular enumerators of the Implementation Coordination Unit (ICU) agency from Pahang,
Kelantan, and Terengganu conducted the survey in Jul-Oct 2012.

2.3 Identification of Variables

8

There are four dimensions of food security, such as availability of food, stability of supply,
accessibility to food, and utilization of food (FAO, 2005, 2008). The availability of food means
sufficient quantities of quality food that is available at household level. The accessibility of
food means a household‟s access to sufficient resources, including a set of all commodity
bundles that an individual can gain access to on the basis of the legal, economic, political,
and social arrangement of a community, where they live for getting quality foods for a
nutritious meal. Food utilization shows the significance of non-food inputs in food security,
such as proper diet, clean water, healthcare, and sanitation to gain nutritional well-being by
which all physiological requirements are met. Food system stability refers to a household
having access to sufficient food at all times so that they should not risk losing access to food
as a result of a sudden crisis, such as an economic or climatic change crisis or cyclical
occurrence, like as seasonal food insecurities.

In this study, the household status of food accessibility and household food
availability were considered as the dependent variables. Household food availability was
based on the measurement of the direct perception of the household, and household status of
food accessibility measurement was based on the frequency of calculation. To measure the
status of household food availability, households were asked about their food status in the
previous month of interview (see Table 2), and to measure the status of household food
accessibility, this study followed the direct measuring questionnaire-based techniques
developed by Coates et al. (2007) for USAID, which is known as the Household Food
Insecurity Access (HFIA) (Table 1).

Household Food Insecurity Access (HFIA) was calculated for each household by
assigning a code 1-4, where 4=Food Secure Access, 3=Mildly Food Insecure Access,
2=Moderately Food Insecure Access, and 1=Severely Food Insecure Access. Initially, the
data were coded as frequency-of-occurrence as 0 for all cases where the answer to the
corresponding occurrence question was “no” (i.e., if Q1=0 then Q1a=0, etc.). Then, the
intensities of the occurrence of nine questions were measured in three frequencies – rarely (12 times per month) or sometimes (3-10 times) or often (10+ times per month) –indicated by
Q1a to Q9a (Table 1). Finally, the four food accessibility categories were created
sequentially, to ensure that households were classified according to their most severe
response.

In the present study, resilience refers to the household‟s ability or strength to cope
with stress and hardship in case of actual or expected food insecurity. Household resilience
factors are categorized as socioeconomic, physical assets, and livelihood strategy and
behavior. Adaptation practices refer to actions or adjustments in ecological, social, or
economic systems in response to actual or expected food insecurity. Factors of adaptation
practices and expected support are categorized as climatic and non-climatic factors.

There are very few studies available to get a standardized list of resilience and
adaptation variables relevant to household food security. However, literature shows different
types of factors related to food security, such as political, economic and natural indicators,
infrastructure, security (Lovendal & Knowles, 2006; Nyariki & Wiggins, 1997); hygiene,
sanitation, unsafe water supply (Makinen et al., 2000); isolation from markets (Webb et al.,
1992; Negatu, 2006); demography (Baer & Madrigal, 1993; Lino, 1996; Iram & Butt, 2004;
Piaseu, 2006); health and nutrition (Myntti, 1993; Pfeiffer et al., 2001; Hindin, 2006;Fartahun
et al., 2007); food budget, savings (Cristofar & Basiotis, 1992; Rose et al., 1995; Olson et al.,
1997); locality (Maxwell et al., 1999); technology (Nyariki & Wiggins, 1997; Negatu, 2006);
access to land, land tenure system, land productively (ECA, 2004); transportation and
unemployment (Negatu, 2006); etc. Interestingly, studies also show that many low-income
households have food security and many households above the poverty line present
indications of food insecurity (Olson et al., 1997; Rose, 1999). Thus, this study used a list of
variables that were collected based on the literature related to the four dimensions of food
security and conducted an initial pilot survey. The list of the independent variables of the
study consisted of different resilience factors of a household (X1-X18), adaptation practices
of a household (X19-X46), and the expected external support for adaptation to food security
(X47-X58). The measurements of all of the variables are given in appendix 1.

2.4 Model Specification
To check the relationship between household status for food security and their resilience
factors, the following ordinal regressions was done based on the logit model:
Zi = ƒ (Xi)

(1)

Zi = (Y1, Y2)
Xi = (X1…X18)

To check the relationship between household status of food security and their
adaptation practices to food insecurity, the following ordinal regressions were carried out
based on the logit model:
Zi = ƒ (Xi)

(2)

Zi = (Y1, Y2)
Xi = (X19…X46)
Further, to find out the relationship between household status of food security and
types of expected support to adapt to food insecurity, the following ordinal regressions were
conducted based on the logit model:
Zi = ƒ (Xi)

(3)

Zi = (Y1, Y2)
Xi = (X47…X58)
Finally, a correlation analysis was conducted in order to find out the relationship
among the relevant variables and to check the multicollinearity problem.
3. Results and Analysis

3.1 Status of Household Food Security
In terms of household food availability, 14.8% respondents said that they had enough food
according to their likings but the majority (41.1%) of the households mentioned that they
always did have enough of the food they liked. 9.1% of the households mentioned that they
frequently stayed hungry (Table 2).

Based on the HFIA category, this study found that 52.8% of the households were
under the category of “food secure” (Table 3). Among the surveyed households, 23.3% faced
mild food insecurity (access); out of them, many of them were worried about not having
enough food sometimes or often, and/or unable to eat preferred foods, and/or rarely ate a
more monotonous diet than desired and/or also rarely ate some undesirable foods.

Among the households, the result showed that 14.3% felt moderately food insecurity.
These households frequently sacrificed quality of food by eating a monotonous diet or
undesirable food sometimes or often, and/or reduced eating the quantity of food rarely or
sometimes. There were 9.6% of households that felt severely food insecurity ; in addition,
they graduated to cutting back on meal size or number of meals often, and/or experienced any
of the three most severe conditions. These conditions included running out of food, going to
bed hungry, or going a whole day and night without eating – even as infrequently as rarely or
at least once in the previous month.

3.2 Household Status of Food Security and Resilience Factors
The regression models based on Equation 1 show that some of the resilience factors have a
statistically significant relationship with household food availability and food accessibility
(Table 4). The p-values of the likelihood ratio (LR) statistics for both models shown below
are 0.0000001, which suggests a good fit of the models. The pseudo R-squares are 0.12 for
food availability and 0.15 for the food accessibility models.

13

Among the socioeconomic resilience factors, improvement of household economic
conditions, increase of the ratio of earning family members to the total family members, and
availability of savings have been found to be statistically significant, and this indicates more
food availability and accessibility at the household level. On the other hand, the higher the
number of school-going children the lower the food security in the household with both
statistical and significant indication.. For a one unit increase in the number of school going
children, the odds of food availability and accessibility at the household are decreased by
25.4% (1 – 0.746) and 26.7% (1 – 0.733), respectively.

As a physical asset of household, availability of transport for buying food was has
been found to be statistically significant, and this indicates more about food availability and
accessibility at the household level. The odds of household food availability and accessibility
were 61% and 99% higher for those who have transportation. Furthermore, among the
livelihood strategy and behavior under resilience factors, households managing waste
properly was also statistically significant, indicating more food availability and accessibility
in the household. Households that had knowledge about maintaining the nutrition level and
had a good sense of hygiene were found to be statistically significant to cause food
accessibility at the household level.

3.3 Household Status of Food Security and Adaptation Practices
The regression models based on Equation 2 suggest that some of the adaptation approach
from both climatic and non-climatic factors had a statistical and significant relationship with
household food availability and accessibility (Table 5). The p-values of the likelihood ratio
(LR) statistics for both models were below 0.0000001, which shows a very good fit of the
models. The pseudo R-squares were 0.18 for food availability and 0.22 for the food
accessibility models.

Among the non-climatic approach of adaptation, it was found that reducing food
variation explained statistically and significantly both food availability and accessibility at
the household level. However, reducing fruit and vegetable consumption as well as taking
cheap medical treatment for adaptation did not statistically and significantly indicate food
availability and accessibility at the household level. Moreover, households that applied the
technique of changing the food processing system held 66% more odds in food availability in
the household. Moreover, , the adaptation techniques of cooking whatever food available and
delaying medical treatments as well as migrating to other places statistically and significantly
indicated household food accessibility, but engaging supplementary job as an adaptation
approach statistically and significantly did not indicate to have food accessibility at the
household level.

Among the climatic approach of adaptation, applying the technique of changing food
processing system was found to be statistically significant to explain both food availability

16

and accessibility at the household level. However, reducing the number of meals and food
variation did not statistically and significantly indicate food availability and accessibility at
the household level. In addition, households reducing spending on children‟s education for
adaptation to climatic food insecurity did not statistically and significantly indicate gaining
food availability.

3.4 Household Status for Food Security and Expected Supports
There are a few external agencies, such as the district office, department of social welfare,
health clinic, farmer‟s association, NGO, political parties, zakah board, and social support
program, etc. that provide a few services. Among these services, a few households mentioned
about receiving RM 500 from the Malaysia fund and Rancangan Makanan Tambahan (RMT)
or Food Supplement Program, RM 200 from the fish development board, RM 300 as well as
kitchen staff ( e.g. stove, cooking pot, etc.) valued at RM150 from the department of social
welfare, RM 4800 for children‟s aid from the Department of Social Welfare (JKM), RM 200
every month from the farmer‟s association, and a few funds from charity or zakah. Among
the households, 67.8% mentioned that the external services were are satisfactory and 63.9%
followed the recommendation and guidelines provided by these agencies. However,
households mentioned that the support was not adequate, and they expected more support.

Among the expected support, 65% of the households mentioned the necessity for
overall external support to adapt to food insecurity (Table 6). Among the climatic relevant
supports, 63.5% expected support for climatic related subsidies or rationing for food. It is
also found that 94.3% expected support from food aids for emergency time; 93% expected
support for providing emergency services for a time of disaster, and 90.9% expected support
for special food distribution arrangements in emergency times. Among the relevant general
support, 81.7% expected support for income increasing program or incentive; 84.1%
expected support for road and transport infrastructure improvement; 85.9% expected support
for improving drinking water services; 87.6% expected support for improving health and
medical services; 79.3% expected support for updating the food distribution channel; 90.4%
expected support for monitoring and adjustment in price at the local market, and 68.7%
expected support for improving agriculture and other agency services.

The regression models based on Equation 3 shows some of the expected support
related to both climatic and non-climatic factors that have a statistically significant
relationship with household food availability and accessibility (Table 7). The p-values of the
likelihood ratio (LR) statistics for both models are below 0.0000001, which suggests a very
good fit of the models. The pseudo R-squares are 0.02 for food availability and 0.022 for the
food accessibility models.

Among different types of expected support, the statistically significant support related
to both climatic and non-climatic factors was the overall support to ensure food security.
Non-climatic factors improved the health and medical services whereas the climatic factors
provided emergency services for disaster time and special food distribution arrangements in
times of emergency.

The statistically significant odds ratio values indicate that the support to improve
health and medical services and the support for special food distribution arrangements in
emergency times were the expectations of the food available and accessible households.
Holding other things constant, for a unit increase in the expectation of support for improving
health and medical services, the odds in favor of food availability and accessibility in the
household increased by 38.9 and 46%, respectively. Similarly, there was a 55.9% and 70.6%
increase of odds to food availability and accessibility in the household for a one-unit increase
in the expectation of support for special food distribution arrangements in emergency times.

However, the overall support to ensure household food security is the common
expectation of the food unavailable and inaccessible households. There was a 25% and 24%
decrease of odds to food availability and accessibility in households for a one-unit increase in
the expectation of overall support to ensure household food security. Moreover, households
that did not have access to food also expected to get support by providing emergency services
for disaster times. This means that holding other things constant, for a unit increase in the
expectation of support for providing emergency services for disaster times, the odds in favor
of household food accessibility decreased by 31.4%.

3.5 Model Efficiency Test
When two variables are considered highly correlated to each other and explain the dependent
variable, it may cause a multicollinearity problem. multicollinearity problem occurs when the
correlation values are considered 0.8 or above (Field, 2000: 2, 44-322). To identify if there
are any multicollinearity problems present among the variables, the Pearson Correlation tests
19

were performed in the study. The result shows that the correlation values among the variables
for resilience factors (Appendix 2), adaptation approaches (Appendix 3), and expected
support (Appendix 4) fell below 0.8, which indicates that multicollinearity was absent among
the variables.

4. Discussion

This study found several resilience factors, adaptation approaches, and expected external
support to be statistically significant to explain household status of food security. However,
these variables also differed between food secure and insecure groups. Results show that at
the household level, the food insecure households needed to be more focused on the
adaptation techniques that were significantly applied by the food secured group. Moreover,
the findings of this study are supported by other studies around the world. For instance, a
study from Smith and Frankenberger (2018) during the flood in 2014 found some suggestive
evidence that resilience (e.g., social capital, human capital, exposure to information, asset
holdings, livelihood diversity, safety nets, access to markets and services, women‟s
empowerment, governance, and psycho-social capabilities) reduced the negative impact of
the flooding on household food security for Bangladesh.

At the local scale, research on food systems resilience has mostly focused on disaster
response case studies and detailed evaluations of infrastructure, governance, and social
networks (Béné et al 2016). At the global level, resilience research has a different focus,
evaluating economic patterns and relationships rather than food security for individuals or
households by tracking how shocks to the food system propagate internationally (Marchand
et al 2016). However, this study also found several support needed to be ensured, such as
increased income, encouragement to generate and develop savings related programs,
arrangement of transportation and infrastructure facilities, provision of better health and
medical services, special food distribution arrangements, and availability of emergency
services for disaster times. They are related to both the climatic and non-climatic factors.

As ensuring food security requires food production and distribution systems function
throughout disruptions (Seekell et al., 2017), to reduce food insecurity among the poor and
low income households in Malaysia, involvements of relevant stakeholders are very
important (Smit & Skinner, 2002). Therefore, national governments should play a major role
20

in addressing the challenging food security issues via budgets, policies, and by having
legislative guidelines with efforts focused on adaptation by other interested parties. Private
sector can also engage in the adaptation process in various ways, including and creating their
opportunities for business. They can ensure availability of food during times of shortfall in
production, and availability of inputs from agriculture as well as provision of credit against
labor, harvests, etc. Banks and insurance organizations can offer different savings, credit
facilities, and insurance schemes to seasonal food insecure groups. Community-based
organizations (CBOs) in risk management can also contribute when there is no formal set up
yet. Relying on the social capital, CBOs can help the poor and low-income Malaysian
households in controlling and coping with risks as well as preventing risks, such as being the
co-sponsor of local plans for infrastructure development.

Moreover, climate change affect the groups that have always been at risk of food
insecurity, and it also affects new groups who become vulnerable to regional weather
changing conditions (IPCC, 2007). Additionally, farmers have to deal with changing weather
patterns and rising frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, resulting in making
farming even more risky (IPCC, 2012). Malaysia is also adversely affected by climatic issues
(Alam et al., 2010, 2011). Furthermore, changes in climate factors are likely to affect
adversely the agriculture production and consequently food security of the country (Alam et
al., 2017). For example, rice production in Malaysia is extremely vulnerable to weather
changes and extreme conditions, such as drought and flooding. The results of a study by
Vaghefi, et al. (2016) showed that during the main and off growing seasons, increase in
temperature and changes rainfall pattern could be expected to reduce the rice yield by 12 and
31.3%, respectively, until the year 2030. A study from Bangladesh by Farzana et al., in 2017
showed that households suffering from moderate and severe food insecurity, were more
likely to adopt both financial and food compromisation coping strategies. Moreover, another
study from Douxchamps et al. (2016) found that adaptation strategies improved the food
security status of most households in four West African countries (Burkina Faso, Ghana and
Senegal).

Therefore, the design of food security programs in Malaysia must be integrated with
climate change in adaptation programs. The local, national, and regional administrations and
resources need to be ensured for capacity building in communities that are particularly at risk
for food insecurity as well as climate change. Furthermore, Sustainable Development Goals
21

(SDGs) might be integrated with them too. Moreover, Malaysia is stepping up its efforts to
improve self-sufficiency levels (SSL) in food production and preparing for the impacts of
climate-related disasters to ensure food security. To achieve SDG goal 2, sustainable
agriculture development is guided by the National Agrofood Policy 2011–2020 and National
Commodity Policy 2011–2020 of Malaysia, which includes the use of quality seeds, breeds
and fries, wider adoption of effective technologies among farmers, and establishment of new
large scale food production areas (EPU, 2017). Malaysia also has been proactive in
maintaining genetic diversity and undertaking research in climate-resistant crops and farmed
animals.

Through the improvement of SSL of Malaysia on various agricultural product,
Malaysia is still relying on imports from foreign countries in various food commodities, such
as rice, fruits, dairy milk and beef. Moreover, with growing population growth, demand for
food that is expected to increase by 70 to 100% by 2050 will pose a threat to food security to
Malaysia. In 2015, food import bills alone hit almost RM45.4 billion while exports of only
RM 27 billion left the deficit of more than RM18 billion. If this situation persists, Malaysia
will likely to face the food crisis in the future (UPM, 2017). Recent studies have shown that
low-income rural people are more susceptible to food crises due to the larger family size, the
number of school children and unemployed mothers (Paul, 2013; Selamat et al., 2015), and
the findings of Paul (2013) and Selamat et al. (2015) support this study.

To adequately deal with the effects of climate changes on food security, plans have to
be initiated with a good analysis of the groups that are already particularly marginal at
present. In vulnerable places where people are affected by both food insecurity and climate
changes effects, increasingly adopting an integrated method that takes into account risk
reduction, the resilient livelihoods, and the underlying causes of food insecurity and
vulnerability is the best option (Alam et al. 2012b). Adaptation methods that influence
various groups in various ways also need to be checked carefully (Stern, 2007; Pielke et al.,
2007). Several adaptation methods lower some groups‟ vulnerability, but may increase the
vulnerability in other groups instead. For an example, the devaluation of currency improves
the domestic prices of food and trading goods, benefits the farmers to produce surpluses of
tradable products, but that affects producers of non-tradable products negatively, such as
unskilled landless laborers or subsistence farmers (FAO, 1997).

22

As this study found that expected supports from other institutions were very crucial in
terms of reducing food insecurity, and this aspect is absent in the study areas. There are many
supporting literature on this. For example, an estimated 85.7 percent of American households
were food secure throughout the entire year in 2013; out of which 62% of all food-insecure
households participated in one or more of the three largest Federal food and nutrition
assistance programs. Moreover, many studies have found significant relation between food
security and support from different institutions (Béné et al., 2016; Fabinyi et al., 2017; Rezai
et al., 2016; Thi et al., 2015; Qureshi et al., 2015).

5. Conclusions

Households need to apply the technique of changing food processing and storage system,
gaining knowledge about maintaining nutrition level and good sense of hygiene, find
alternative scope for migration, ensure savings, reducing food variation, and enough income
opportunity for adaptation to food insecurity. Some prominent storage systems are canning,
freezing, freeze-drying, vacuum packing, storage in gases, drying etc. (Hammond et al.
2015).

Furthermore, Malaysia should reduce its import dependency on food. Moreover,
Malaysia should boost up its SSL to ensure food security for future population. Additionally,
expected support from other institution, like NGOs, government agencies should increase
towards poor community of Malaysia. At the same time, in the long run, climate change
mitigation methods should be designed to curb nutritional challenges and food security issues
due to changes in the climate. People who are vulnerable should be empowered and
encouraged to adapt to climate changes by developing resilience via investments in health,
social protection, education, etc.

Finally, the researchers suggest that new additional studies need to be undertaken to
validate or reject the overall findings of the current study. This study found the important
adaptation techniques and supports for the food insecure group. The findings of the study are
empirically very new. Furthermore, the result might change over the time and based on
situation. Therefore, there are huge scopes to further explore the issues discussed in this
article. The results of this study can be investigated further and validated against other

23

socioeconomic and demographic factors, different locations, different economic groups, and
the level of food security and also by measuring in different ways.
