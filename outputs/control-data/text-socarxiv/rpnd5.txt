"4" "In a very large part of morphology, our essential task lies in the comparison of related forms rather than in the precise definition of each (Thompson 1917:723)."
"5" "Historically, attempts to  dis cern the temporal and spatial dynamics of Caddo groups in the archaeological record have employed different similarity measures to link groups of sites or communities with similar features and material culture assemblages (Harrington 1920; Krieger 1947; Newell and Krieger 1949). Some have posited that Caddo groups and communities first emerged in two areas: one in the Great Bend of the Red River in  s outhwest Arkansas and  n orthwest Louisiana, and the other concentrated in the Arkansas River basin in eastern Oklahoma (Story 1981); the George C. Davis site, located in the Neches River drainage in  e ast Texas, is also thought to have been occupied at or before the same time (Story 1998; Story and Valastro 1977). Others have considered the Fourche Maline culture the singular antecedent of Caddo culture (Rose et al. 1998; Schambach 2002). Current discourse on Caddo origins proposes a model of gradual social and economic change (Girard 2009) that developed largely in situ (Corbin 1989, 1998) from different Woodland period cultures (Ellis 2013; Schambach 1998, 2002; Story 1990) . E ach  of these cultures is  indistinguishable from one another biologically (Rose et al. 1998), but  they  have  discernible differences in mound building practices, settlement complexity, and material culture assemblages (Perttula 2017)."
"6" "Caddo cultures are distinct   yet sufficiently linked to the Mississippian Southeast (Blitz 2009; Early 2004), and locally   to one another. Caddo ceramic types and varieties often serve as exemplars of these links (Perttula 2008, 2014; Suhm and Jelks 1962; Suhm and Krieger 1954), where decorative attributes and motifs, in addition to features and contextual information, are employed as markers of group identity.  This qualitative dataset can then be paired with the quantitative data where additional lines of inquiry can be investigated.  The quantitative study of Caddo ceramic shape is not novel (Selden 2017; Selden et al. 2014; Turpin and Neely 1977; Turpin et al. 1976), and this endeavor enlists geometric morphometrics (GM) to test whether Formative/Early Caddo  period  bottle morphologies differ across the geographies of the preceding Fourche Maline and Mossy Grove  culture areas (Perttula 2017:Figure 21). This basic research effort is focused upon testing for differences in shape between two geographical areas where bottle shapes m ay  be said to differ. In this analysis, the Late/Historic Caddo  period  sample is counterposed with the Formative/Early Caddo  period  sample across the same geography, providing the requisite baseline data for subsequent studies related to the formal characterization of shape change in Caddo bottles through time. Results are then considered in light of a recent stylistic and compositional analysis  in which  Formative/Early Caddo  period  fine wares discarded or interred in the Arkansas River basin in eastern  Oklahoma--or northern Caddo area--were interpreted to be products of trade with the southern Caddo groups (Lambert 2017 ; see also Chapter  8 , this volume )."
"7" "Defined as “a vessel with a spheroid or oval body, surmounted by a slender, cylindrical neck,” Caddo bottles were initially viewed as a relatively homogenous ceramic form; some  were  interpreted to be the work of individual makers due to marked similarities in shape and decorative motif (Harrington 1920:187). Caddo vessel shapes are variable among groups and through time, reflective of stylistic, functional, and social change (Perttula 2010). Krieger (1946) previously noted spatial and temporal differences associated with bottle morphologies in East Texas, and a recent partition of bottle shapes has been proposed for  n ortheast Texas Caddo sites that segregated bottles into 27 idiographic shape categories (Perttula 2015:Figure 2). In  s outheast Oklahoma, shape differences have been noted in the Early and Late McCurtain phase for bottle necks and bodies (Regnier 2013). Caddo bottles demonstrate lower axial asymmetry  more  than  do  bowls and ollas (Selden 2017); however, additional work is needed to identify whether--and to what extent--this observation holds true across geography, time, and a broader range of vessel categories. More recently, some have posited that Caddo decorative motifs are directly correlated with vessel shape (Early 2012; Lambert 2017)."
"8" "Caddo potters were purported to have “had no superiors short of the Pueblo country” (Swanton 1996:239) . They  elevated local ceramic production to a high art (Smith 1995), leading some analysts to posit that Caddo bottles rest at the apex of Native American ceramic technology (Gadus 2013). Taxonomic  definitions for Caddo ceramics integrate semiotic and morphological attributes, and Caddo types include an expansive range of vessel shapes that are comprised of bottles, bowls, carinated bowls, and ollas among others (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Suhm and Krieger 1954). Previous analyses have demonstrated that aspects of morphology differ among Caddo bottles (Selden 2018a, 2018b,  2019 ) and Gahagan bifaces (Selden et al. 2018) found above and below  a  n orthwest Louisiana  shape boundary (Figure 15.1)."
"9" "As a fundamental attribute employed in the analysis of archaeologically   recovered ceramics, morphology alone may not be able to distinguish the full range of ceramic variability (Shepard 1977). The integrated analysis of shape and size (form) provides information related to the contributions of allometry and isometry (Claude 2008), which articulate with the semiotic descriptions characteristic of the Caddo types (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Suhm and Krieger 1954). Webb and Dodd (1941) previously noted the pear-shaped body and basal morphology associated with Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles found at the Belcher Mound site, and Webb (1959) later discussed the globular and pear-shaped bodies of Smithport Plain bottles in his analysis of material culture from the Belcher Mound and Smithport Landing sites. While ceramic type assignments associated with each specimen are known, with two exceptions, only the temporal association--Formative/Early Caddo or Late/Historic Caddo--and the location of sites north or south of the shape boundary were used as qualitative analytic attributes  in this study ."
"10" "Previous analyses that have enlisted the tools of GM (Figure 15.2) provide the requisite foundation upon which this inquiry is built. Geometric morphometric methods have utility in delimiting how Caddo bottle shapes and sizes vary within a cultural framework to generate and test hypotheses of fluctuating vessel shape employed by groups or sub-groups of Caddo potters (i.e., Kadohadacho, etc.), and in characterizing how those shapes or forms (shape + size) may have developed or changed through time. These sequences of morphological change can be compared across the larger ancestral Caddo territory, and can be further parsed to investigate where and how specific morphological changes  are  manifest ed  in concert with other qualitative or quantitative variables (i.e., features, artifact classes, linear measurements, etc.)."
"11" "The analysis adduces 72 Caddo bottles from 19 sites to test the hypothesis of distinct bottle morphologies associated with sites north and south of the shape boundary from within the spatial extent of the preceding Fourche Maline and Mossy Grove culture areas (Table 15.1 ; see Figure 15.1 ). This analysis was followed by additional tests to identify whether a difference in Formative/Early  Caddo  and Late/Historic Caddo bottle shapes occurs between and among the northern and southern Caddo groups in the southern Caddo area. Other tests include whether bottle shape varies with size, whether the null hypothesis of parallel slopes for Formative/Early  Caddo  and Late/Historic Caddo bottles is supported or rejected, and whether any group displays greater shape or size variation among   individual  bottles  relative to other groups."
"12" "All Caddo bottles used in the analysis fall under the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) and are known or assumed to have come from Caddo burial contexts, excepting those found in Houses 2 and 6 at the Belcher Mound site (see Table 15.1). The Caddo Nation of Oklahoma granted permission to scan the collections with the provision that any scan data used in the analysis must not include the texture (color) file. Full-resolution scan data were sent to the Caddo Nation of Oklahoma with the texture applied. This provides the Caddo with an accurate record of each vessel, and a means of viewing and interacting with the d igitally aggregated collection."
"13" "Primary data are included in the Open Science Framework, where the unprocessed 3D scan files, images, and metadata can be viewed and downloaded alongside those data from previous GM projects. Processed data can be accessed through Zenodo at CERN, where they are available for use in subsequent studies under a Creative Commons license. All new 3D meshes used in this study will be uploaded to the Index of Texas Archaeology Type Collections, where users can view and interact with the meshes, view and download photos of the vessels, and browse the associated metadata. The metadata included with each image can be harvested through the Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH) for use in future projects. All images are open access, can be downloaded at full, medium, and thumbnail resolutions, and shared across more than 270 social media platforms."
"14" "Methods"
"15" "The bottles were scanned with a Creaform GoSCAN 50 at a 0.8 mm resolution or a Creaform GoSCAN20 at 0.5 mm resolution depending on their size. Scanner calibration was optimized prior to each scan, with positioning targets required for increased accuracy, and shutter speed reconfigured in each instance. A clipping plane was established to reduce the amount of superfluous data collected during each scan. Following data collection, resolution for the GoSCAN 50 meshes was increased to 0.5 mm, and meshes from both scanners were transferred to VXmodel where the final mesh was rendered following application of the clean mesh function. This process removed isolated patches, self-intersections, spikes, small holes, singular vertices, creased edges, narrow triangles, outcropping triangles, narrow bridges, and non-manifold triangles prior to export as an ASCII stl file. The stl was subsequently imported to Geomagic Design X (Dx) 2019.0.0 ,  where each mesh was subjected to  an  automated post-processing routine to detect and correct any abnormal poly-faces in advance of performing a global remesh to improve mesh quality."
"16" "Prior to pursuing the mixed-method analysis that employed data from two different scanners, two meshes of the same object—produced with the Creaform GoSCAN 50 and GoSCAN 20—were imported to a computer-aided inspection program (Geomagic Control X 2018.0.1) in an effort to identify any significant deviations that may exist between the meshes in advance of the GM analysis. The tolerance level for the inspection was selected by using the highest resolution of the GoSCAN 20 (0.1 mm). Small areas of the rim exhibited minor  differences while the remainder of the vessel is within the arbitrary 0.1 mm tolerance (Selden 2018a, 2018c)."
"17" "Landmarks and semilandmarks"
"18" "A total of nine landmarks and 46 semilandmarks segregate each bottle into four discrete components corresponding with the rim, neck, body, and base (Table 15.2 and Figure 15.3). Discussions of the alignment process and the application of reference geometry are detailed elsewhere (Selden  2018a, 2018b, 2019 ). Landmarks and semilandmarks were populated along the spline, and numbering began on the side of the bottle profile determined to include the widest point. Divisions between each component articulate with those of the spline splits, where landmarks were placed at each of the points in Table 15.2, with a series of equidistant semilandmarks between."
"19" "While sliding semilandmarks were an early consideration, the decision to use equidistant semilandmarks rather than sliding semilandmarks is based upon preliminary results from an earlier study (Selden  2019 :Figure 3). In the analysis of the Webb collection (Selden  2019 ), the first landmark and sliding semilandmark configuration did not split the spline between the neck and rim of the bottles, and when mean shapes were generated for each ceramic type, an anomaly--from the everted rims of Belcher Engraved bottles--was added to the otherwise direct or tapered necks of the Hickory Engraved and Smithport Plain bottles. The use of sliding semilandmarks was abandoned because they could potentially influence the results of this analysis by introducing a morphological attribute to specimens where one does not exist. The constellation of landmarks  and equidistant semilandmarks used in this study draws  its  influence from the characteristic points and tangents employed in the study of aesthetic measure by Birkhoff (1933), as well as a selection of studies that followed (Denkowska et al. 1994; Staudek 1999)."
"20" "Analysis"
"21" "Landmarks and equidistant semilandmarks were exported as x, y, and z coordinate data from Dx. Those data were aligned to a global coordinate system (Kendall 1981, 1984; Slice 2001), achieved through generalized Procrustes superimposition (Rohlf and Slice 1990) performed in R 3.5.2 (R Development Core Team 2018) using the  geomorph  library v.3.0.7 (Adams et al. 2018; Adams and Otárola-Castillo 2013). Procrustes superimposition translates, scales, and rotates the coordinate data to allow for comparisons among objects (Gower 1975; Rohlf and Slice 1990). The  geomorph  package uses a partial Procrustes superimposition that projects the aligned specimens into tangent space subsequent to alignment in preparation for the use of multivariate methods that assume linear space (Rohlf 1999; Slice 2001)."
"22" "Principal components analysis (Jolliffee 2002) was used as an exploratory means of visualizing shape variation among the bottles. The shape changes described by each principal axis are commonly visualized using thin-plate spline warping of a reference 3D mesh (Klingenberg 2013; Sherratt et al. 2014). A residual randomization permutation procedure (RRPP; n=10,000 permutations) was used for all Procrustes ANOVAs (Adams and Collyer 2015; Collyer and Adams 2018), which has higher statistical power and a greater ability to identify  patterns in the data should they be present (Anderson and Ter Braak 2003). To assess whether shape differs by size (allometry) and site, Procrustes ANOVAs (Goodall 1991) were run that used effect-sizes (z-scores) computed as standard deviates of the generated sampling distributions (Collyer et al. 2015). A Procrustes ANOVA was also run to assess whether shape changes with size. The assumption of allometric slope homogeneity was tested with the  procD.allometry  function using the PredLine option (Adams and Nistri 2010). Should this test not yield a significant result, then allometric slopes are similar--if not identical--across the categories used in the analysis."
"23" "A Procrustes ANOVA and pairwise test was used to identify populations where bottle shapes differ. The pairwise test is conceptually similar to trajectory analysis (Adams and Collyer 2007, 2009; Collyer and Adams 2007, 2013) in that pairwise statistics are vector lengths between vectors, but differs in that a factorial model is not explicitly needed to contrast vectors between point factor levels nested within group factor levels (Adams et al. 2018). Procrustes variance was used to discriminate between groups and to compare the amount of shape and size variation (morphological disparity) across communities (Zelditch et al. 2004), estimated as the Procrustes variance using residuals of linear model fit (Adams et al. 2018)."
"24" "Results"
"25" "The mean consensus configuration and Procrustes residuals were calculated using a generalized Procrustes analysis (GPA) (Figure 15.4). This initial view of the data demonstrates the degree of variability in the aggregated  sample of Caddo bottles. As an exploratory measure, GM methods--to include GPA--aid in clarifying shape differences as well as the production of novel  a posteriori  hypotheses (Mitteroecker and Gunz 2009)."
"26" "Principal components analysis (PCA) was conducted on scaled, translated, and rotated landmarks and semilandmarks, and demonstrates that the first two PC’s account for 55 (PC1) and 25 (PC2) percent of the variation in bottle shape (Table 15.3 and Figure 15.5), with each remaining PC representing eight or fewer percent of the variation (Table 15.3). The first two PCs are plotted i n Figure 15.5 , where warp grids represent the shape changes  in  PC1 and PC2."
"27" "A Procrustes ANOVA was used to test for significant allometry. Results of the ANOVA indicate that allometry is significant (RRPP=10,000, Rsq=0.17594, Pr(>F)=1e-04), meaning that Caddo bottle shapes vary significantly with size. Plots of predicted allometric trajectories for geography and period are presented in Figure 15.6. The null hypothesis of parallel slopes is rejected by the homogeneity of slopes test for group allometries (RRPP=10,000, Rsq=0.04251, Pr(>F)=0.0038)."
"28" "A second Procrustes ANOVA was used to test for a significant difference in bottle shape by group (RRPP=10,000, Rsq=0.32574, Pr(>F)=1e-04), followed by a Procrustes ANOVA and pairwise comparison that demonstrates a significant difference between the groups (Table 15.4). The test for morphological disparity of shape did not yield significant results; however, the test of morphological disparity by size did prove to be significant (Table 15.5)."
"29" "Discussion"
"30" "This museum and repository-based analysis of curated intact or reconstructed Caddo bottles resulted in the improved characterization of Caddo bottle shape, and provides an additional line of evidence in support of the gradual in situ development of Caddo cultures fro m  preceding Woodland period cultures (Corbin 1989; Girard 2009; Perttula 2017). Findings demonstrate that the morphology of Caddo bottles found within the Fourche Maline culture area north of the shape boundary differ significantly from those found in the Mossy Grove culture area to the south. This result, when viewed in concert with the morphological explication of Caddo bottles in the Webb collection (Selden  2019 ), analyses of Hickory Engraved (Selden 2018a) and Smithport Plain bottles (Selden  2018b ), as well as results from a recent study of Gahagan biface shape that identified a significant morphological difference north and south of the shape boundary (Selden et al. 2018), illustrates a distinct and visible morphological shift in Caddo material culture products across the shape boundary. The temporal component of the analysis similarly demonstrates discrete morphological differences between the Formative/Early  Caddo  and Late/Historic Caddo samples north and south of the shape boundary (Figure 15.7). These morphological differences transcend typological assignments, and illustrate that two distinct, yet sufficiently linked, groups of Caddo potters were manufacturing divergent bottle forms that are most similar in shape when small, and most heterogeneous in shape when large."
"31" "The mechanisms associated with Woodland-to-Caddo culture change are not well understood (Perttula 2017), and Corbin (1989) suggested that the  earliest East Texas Caddo groups may have been contemporaries with the Mossy Grove groups, thought to have been gradually subsumed or displaced by the Caddo (Corbin 1998). It is the presence of larger settlements and villages with areas noticeably used for ritual purposes that clearly distinguishes between Formative Caddo and  earlier  Woodland period sites (Girard et al. 2014). Additional changes in decorative styles, social connections, settlement patterns, and economic factors shifted gradually during the Formative/Early Caddo periods, for which continuities can be traced through historic times (Girard 2018). Such continuities can also be traced through gradual shifts in Caddo ceramic morphology, and this study represents a necessary step toward the formal quantitative characterization of shape change for Caddo bottles in the southern Caddo area. Quantitatively demonstrating how morphology changes through time can be achieved using phenotypic trajectory analyses (PTA) to test hypotheses associated with temporal changes in discrete morphological traits (Adams and Collyer 2009; Collyer and Adams 2007, 2013; Collyer et al. 2015). The addition of PTA to the toolkit of the ceramic analyst will allow for an improved characterization of how morphology changes across space and time, provide for comparisons of morphological trajectories across a wide range of variables (i.e., culture areas, ceramic types and varieties, river basins, etc.), and allow for the shift from discussions of differences in shape  to one of shape change."
"32" "While this study demonstrates that significant morphological differences existed between Formative/Early  Caddo  and Late/Historic Caddo groups north and south of the shape boundary, the results paint a portrait of the Caddo cultural  landscape at a broad scale. Results lend support to the assertion that Caddo bottle shapes were not prescribed, but labile (Selden 2018a); however, it also demonstrates that at a larger scale--one that transcends type definitions--morphological trends are apparent that may have communicated membership in an established Caddo community of practice or identity. The fact that all but three of the vessels come from, or are assumed to have come from, Caddo burials places additional emphasis on ipseity, which has been used by archaeologists to ascribe membership to a particular Caddo group or community through measures of similarity (Figure 15.8)."
"33" "In a discussion of ceramics and the social contexts of food consumption, Mills (1999) demonstrated that differences in vessel sizes are related to household size, status, and feasting. This assertion may have greater utility in a study of Caddo carinated bowls rather than bottles, but the relationship between size and shape (form) warrants further scrutiny. Perhaps the Formative/Early Caddo bottles produced south of the shape boundary trended toward the larger end of the size spectrum due to the need to regularly host traders from the north. Assuming that water storage was associated with bottle function, larger bottles may have had utility in transporting greater volumes of water across geographies where water was scarce during droughts (Perttula 2017); however, smaller bottles may have been easier to transport. It is also possible that an increase in bottle size articulated with an increase in sedentary behavior as the Caddo shifted from a largely horticultural economy to one of emergent agriculture. The results  also  illustrate d  that Caddo bottles south of the shape boundary generally  trend from larger to smaller from the Formative/Early  Caddo  to the Late/Historic Caddo period, while vessels north of the shape boundary remained comparable in size through time (see Figure 15.6)."
"34" "There is not a significant difference in morphological disparity associated with the shape of Formative/Early Caddo bottles recovered from sites north and south of the shape boundary (although see Selden 2018a; Selden  2018b, 2019 ). However, bottles recovered from the southern sites are more restricted in size during the Formative/Early Caddo period when compared with Formative/Early Caddo bottles recovered north of the shape boundary (see Table 15.5). Thus, aspects associated with the creativity or innovation of Caddo potters (sensu Kenoyer et al. 1991) more readily articulate with bottles recovered at the northern sites, evidenced by greater size variation among individual bottles relative to those recovered from the southern sites. Expediency may yet be another consideration, and it is possible that the skill of Caddo potters matured at different rates, where more experienced makers (sensu Longacre 1999)--or those with a higher rate of production (Roux 2003)--manufactured a more standardized product."
"35" "This line of inquiry could be expanded to include discussions of decorative elements, motifs, and the design grammar employed by Caddo potters; however, it is not possible to know whether the same potter that manufactured each vessel also applied those marks. In this case, differences in Caddo bottle shapes can be said to transcend the assignment of types and decorative elements, affording an additional layer of complexity to interpretations of cultural signals associated with  Caddo bottles. It remains  poorly  understood how compositional and decorative elements align with the morphological results, and further work is warranted to parse the numerous adherent and autogenous signals left behind by Caddo potters (sensu Kubler 1962). Should a difference in ceramic shape be found to articulate with a noticeable difference in decorative elements and motifs,  it  would provide for the recognition of a complementary suite of attributes that merit additional scrutiny and discourse. As mentioned previously, morphological attributes associated with standardization, diversity, and--potentially--skill are among those considerations worthy of further inquiry, a task for which GM is well suited (Selden  2018a, 2018b, 2019 ; Selden et al. 2018; Topi et al. 2017)."
"36" "“Standardization refers to homogeneity in ceramic materials, vessel shape, and/or decoration” (Costin and Hagstrum 1995:622), while diversity “can be most generally considered as the opposite of standardization” (Rice 1991:273). In production contexts, standardization may be seen as the results of improvements in efficiency and minimized labor costs (Sinopoli 1988). However, it is also possible that the skill of an individual may decrease in relation to an increase in the division of manufacturing tasks associated with the standardization of material culture products produced by a group (Arnold 1999). One approach to testing hypotheses of expediency or skill in Caddo bottle manufacture may be to assess deviations from axial symmetry (Selden 2017) for bottles recovered north and south of the shape boundary, where results  could  be couched in discussions of creativity or innovation (Figure 15.9)."
"37" "A recent stylistic and compositional analysis indicated that Formative/Early Caddo fine wares from the Arkansas River basin groups  in eastern Oklahoma  may have been produced in the southern Caddo area and traded to the northern Caddo area (Lambert 2017 ; see also Chapter  8 , this volume ). Geographical discrepancies exist between this study and Lambert’s; however, when viewed in tandem, one interpretive prospect is the production of testable  a posteriori  hypotheses related to the location--north or south of the shape boundary--of bottle production in light of the differential morphological attributes discussed above. While the vagaries of Caddo material culture signatures associated with makers and consumers  are not well  understood, hypotheses that test for similarities and differences between groups of artifacts recovered from disparate contexts and geographies may provide evidence of cultural signals that can inform upon those discussions (sensu Longacre and Stark 1992). Morphological disparity may have utility in clarifying the degree of tolerance for standardization and diversity in and across Caddo vessel assemblages, where a lower tolerance is evidenced by a marked decrease in variation and a higher tolerance by the inverse (Eerkins and Bettinger 2001). Ceramic analysts in the Casas Grandes region have used GM to parse and explore the relationship between standardization and the organization of production (Topi et al. 2017). That model may have some utility in better understanding the morphological nuances associated with the temporal and spatial dynamics of Caddo material culture."
"38" "Conclusion s"
"39" "The results presented here demonstrate significant morphological differences between Caddo bottles discarded or interred across northern and southern portions of the southern Caddo area that persisted from the Formative/Early Caddo period into historic times. This study of morphological patterns in and across the ancestral Caddo territory illustrate s  that: (a) Caddo bottle morphology is protean; (b) similarities and differences in bottle shapes transcend type assignments; (c) bottle forms recovered north and south of the shape boundary in the southern Caddo area are divergent and differ most at their largest size; (d) Formative/Early Caddo potters south of the shape boundary enlisted a smaller range of size variation among individuals relative to other groups; and (e) Caddo potters operating in the southern Caddo area were manufacturing two unique bottle shapes, which m ay  be used to posit a potential origin of production--above or below the shape boundary--for bottles recovered from the northern Caddo area that are considered to be products of trade :  an assertion for which the largest bottles would provide the greatest utility."
