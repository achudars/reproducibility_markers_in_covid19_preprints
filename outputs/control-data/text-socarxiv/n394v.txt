1. Introduction
In 2009, the number of people with disabilities in Syria was estimated to be 2 million, of which over 700,000
were children. Prevalence of disability is estimated to be 10% of the population (Said Foundation, 2009). Syria
is a home for 153,000 blind individuals (Mariotti, 2012) and 200,000 individuals with hearing loss (Krayem,
2010). But now, these numbers would likely increase by 18-20% due to conflict. (Skinner, 2014)
Moreover, a study by the British Syria Relief organization on the needs of youth Persons with Disabilities (PwDs)
in Syria showed that 64% of the participants indicated a need for education services (Tchie, & Tkacova, 2018).
This is exacerbated by the fact that Syria as of 2013, had only 31 governmental centers distributed in several
governorates, besides only 65 local organizations working for the rehabilitation and education of Persons with
Disabilities, out of 2,000 registered NGO in Syria. (Permanent Mission of the Syrian Arab Republic to the United
Nations, 2013).
Syria is one of the last Arab states that doesn’t have a special curriculum adopted for the hearing impaired.
Hearing impaired students are required to filter through two layers of communication to acquire a new piece of
info. This is due to the lack of training and standardization in educational sign language. (Ibrahim, 2010)
It’s also noted that there is discrimination in providing health services for women with disabilities. Youth living
with disabilities are often disregarded in sexual awareness, leaving them denied the tools for the prevention of
STDs, assault and forced pregnancy. (Women Enabled International, 2017)
PwDs are often excluded from aid programs, and ignored when humanitarian organizations establish targeted
services, especially in delicate and conflict-related settings. This is due to a bundle of mental and physical
1

barriers. (Tchie, & Tkacova, 2018) By providing an online platform, named Akkazeh (the Arabic term for Cane)
our project intends to bypass the obstacles of the rarity of braille and special materials in Syria, inflexibility in
time and place, the scarcity of speakers in sign language, stigma and bullying, as well as stultified curricula.
This project aims to create a website hosting Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) specifically designed for
the blind, hearing impaired, and Motor-Impaired persons, to foster inclusion and help these individuals pass
their mandated official exams in grades nine through twelve. In addition, it will host videos and articles to raise
awareness for and about Persons with Disabilities (PwDs).

2. Scope
This project will span about 18 months with 20 team members, and a number of volunteers to assist the
production of 150 videos, 75 audio clips and 100 articles, through seven production cycles for audio-visual
materials. The scope includes planning, execution, and operation of a modern, user-friendly website, audiovisual content, and a social media network. This entails an interview-based needs assessment of a
representative sample of the PwD population in Syria. Further content such as articles, social media posts, and
advertising campaigns will be published starting the sixth month of implementation.
The target group is Syrian people (between 15 – 45 years) with physical, visual or hearing impairments and their
respective communities. This project will not be targeting people with psychiatric, neurological or intellectual
disabilities. The project is also not responsible for issuing legally-binding educational certificates, nor does it
replace the current official infrastructure in education and training.

3. Strategy
Akkazeh will be incorporating volunteers from Eemaa’s team (A local non-government organization) as actors
in the production phases, as well as consultants on content from its in-person teachers. This will help identify
key gaps in modifying the information to accessible curricula for the clients.
Moreover, a needs assessment phase is conducted at the beginning of the implementation to ensure the
relevance of the subjects to be discussed on the website. The project management will also make use of the
fact that PwD communities are often exclusive and thus word-of-mouth can travel very fast to ensure the
required number of participants.
The platform will be adjusted to work on mobile phones as well as research shows that Syrian vulnerable
populations are more likely to depend more on mobile phones to access the internet. (UNHCR, 2016) The
content will be selective in nature so that prospective students will be able to pick the subject they would like
to learn about from a variety of options. For example, under physics: capacitors, conduction, light
properties…etc.

Online education can sustain high dropout rates.

Internet in Syria can be unreliable in some
provinces.
Major online advertisers (Google and
Facebook) don’t operate in Syria.
Distance learning is a relatively new
concept in Syria.

10. Risk Management Plan
Risk
a) High course drop-out
rate
Likelihood: 80-100%
Impact: High

b) Website going offline
Likelihood: 30-60%
Impact: High
c) Social Media accounts
going offline
Likelihood: 30-60%
Impact: Medium
d) Cast/crew injury,
sickness, or
unavailability
Likelihood: 30-60%
Impact: Low
e) Equipment
malfunction

Details
The literature records drop-out levels for
on-line courses of 25% to 45% compared
to 10% to 20% for face-to-face classes
(Levy, 2007*). Reasons for drop-out
include: Student' unfamiliarity with
online learning, Teacher's attitudes,
perceptions of ease of use, and
variations in assessment.
The website could get hacked or there
could be a malfunction due to server
pressure.

What we should do
Tutorials will be included, Active
customer service created, Measures
to reinforce ease of use during the
design implemented, Methodological
assessment used.

Accounts hacked or content
incompatible with platform policies.

Account protection using the various
verification methods offered by the
platforms, in addition to being wary
of the platforms' posting policy.

A cast or crew member may get sick or
injured before or during the shoot, thus
causing them to be unavailable. Also,
they may simply fail to show up at the
shoot.

Schedules will be disseminated far in
advance, buffer time accounted for in
the schedule for changes. List of backup crew to be to be identified as well.

Offline site back-ups are regularly
saved.

Camera, lighting, sound, or other
Recruited crew are of reputable
equipment being used in the video shoot competence and quality equipment,
may malfunction.

Likelihood: 30-60%
Impact: Low
f) Unforeseeable postproduction difficulties
Likelihood: 30-60%
Impact: Medium
g) Material publishing
delays
Likelihood: 0-30%
Impact: High
h) Location or Studio
disaster
Likelihood: 0-30%
Impact: High

Video and audio editing during postproduction may prove to be more
difficult than we planned for, thus
causing schedule or cost overruns.

Production delays could lead to
publishing delays.

Our chosen locations for shooting the
video may be impacted by a disaster,
such as power outages, extreme
weather, fire etc.

in addition to ensuring a back-up
equipment lessor.
Sticking tightly to the shooting script,
using bottom up budgeting to get
accurate estimates, finalizing all
revisions to the script prior to
shooting, and carefully examining
delays should they happen.
Contingency plans to be made, and
over-time can be reinstated to meet
the deadlines.

The script will not heavily depend on
the location and a back-up location
can be considered.

Appendix: LogFrame estimates
*9,000: The estimation was made based on several studies:
- The cumulative number of blind individuals living in Syria according to WHO estimates is around 153,000
(Mariotti, 2012)
- The cumulative number of persons with hearing loss in Syria is around 200,000 according to our NGO (Eemaa)
that concerns itself with hearing impairment affairs.
- Digital divide studies from several developed countries show that PwDs are less than half as likely to use the
internet. For the purposes of this project we will consider a rate of 30% (Duplaga, 2017; Kaye, 2003)
- According to ITU report, only around 13% of people in the least developed countries have ICT access.
(International Telecommunication Union, 2015)
- According to a study on the needs of PwD youth in Syria, 65% of the sample reported the need for educational
services. (Tchie, & Tkacova, 2018)
Our target for this project will then be calculated as follows:
(200K+153K) x 0.3 x 0.13 x 0.65 ≈ 9,000 Users
**9,000: The target audience number is fit to Massive open online course and advertisement bundles’ costs.
***60,000: Assuming a family of 5 individuals per participant.
