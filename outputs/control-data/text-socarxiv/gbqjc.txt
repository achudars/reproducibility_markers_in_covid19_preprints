"14" "Introduction"
"15" "Children’s perception of safety  is a  major component of  their  well-being  and correlate  of  different aspects of children’s lives   (Ben-Arieh & Shimon, 2014; Fattore et al., 2009; González et al., 2012; Nayak, 2003) .  The field of positive psychology considers safety as an important domain of children  well-being   (Lippman et al., 2011)   while the  Maslow hierarchy of needs identifies safety as a basic second level of need   (Maslow, 1981) .  Fattore et al. (2009)  reported that feeling safe  is  essential for children’s well-being as  it allows them  to fully make use of life opportunities .   Ben-Arieh and Shimon (2014)   found that feeling of safety was positively related with   actual  safety and positively  associated  with  well-being  among 2238 Israeli children.   Meltzer et al. (2007)  reported that perception of   neighborhood safety was associated  with  children’s mental health. Similarly,  Farver et al. (2000)   reported that higher  children’s perception of safety  was associated with better socio emotional functioning which include    self-esteem, academic competence, peer acceptance, physical appearance, and behavioral conduct."
"16" "Furthermore, experts have established that  feeling  safe  is  essential for children that have been affected by armed conflict and violence  (Collins, 2001; Cummings et al., 2016; Garbarino & Kostelny, 1996a, 1996b) .When children are exposed to conflict and violence, their coping strategy is focused towards making themselves feel safe  (Brown & Gourdine, 2001; Collins, 2001; Howard et al., 2002; Rasmussen et al., 2004; Ratner et al., 2006) .  Ehntholt and Yule (2006)  argues that it is after feelings of safety have been established that children can respond to interventions that are targeted at their mental health and  development . Furthermore, previous studies have shown that  children’s perception of safety    reduces  the effect of conflict  and violence on  them   (Collins, 2001; Schwab-Stone et al., 1995) . Ratner et al. (2006)  found that children who felt safe had better cognitive outcomes irrespective of their levels of exposure to community violence.  Overstreet and Braun (2000)   also reported that lower perception of neighborhood safety was related to post traumatic stress symptoms.  Considering the importance of safety perception in children’s well-being and the 420  million  armed  conflict-affected children in recent times (Østby et al., 2018) , it is imperative to have a better understanding of factors that are associated with  perception of safety  for armed conflict-affected children. The aim of this study is to examine family and sociodemographic correlates  of perception  of  safety  among  children  affected  and displaced  by  armed conflict children  during the post displacement phase."
"17" "C hildren  in a rmed conflict"
"18" "C onflict and violence   make  children  feel  unsafe and   their  well-being  are negatively affected   (Chen, 2010; Diab et al., 2015; Farver et al., 2000; Joshi & O'donnell, 2003; Qouta et al., 2008) .  Armed conflict   which  includes war,    armed attacks, use of explosives,  shooting s  ,and  massive killings  exposes children  to persistent violence,  displacement , trafficking, and exploitation  (Pinheiro, 2006; Rubenstein & Stark, 2017) . R esearch   show s  that children   experience psychological distress, impaired social, physical and cognitive development during and after armed conflicts  (Affouneh, 2007; Attanayake et al., 2009; Barenbaum et al., 2004; Joshi & O'donnell, 2003) . For instance,   Goldstein et al. (1997)   reported  a   94% prevalence level of posttraumatic stress  in  a  sample of 394  children who were internally displaced by war .  Likewise,   Cooley-Quille et al. (1995)   found that  children that   are  highly exposed  to community violence exhibited  poor social competence and interpersonal functioning .  Shemyakina (2011)    also observed  that school age girls in  conflict-affected  areas were less likely to complete basic schooling. Likewise,  Milam et al. (2010)  reported a decrease in math and reading achievement  with increase in neighborhood violence.  It is therefore established in literature  that different domains of  well-being  are generally affected by armed conflict. Hence it is important to understand the risk and protective factors for children affected by armed conflict and violence."
"19" "Risk and Protective factors   for children affected by Conflict"
"20" "Factors that have been consistently found to be related to the  well-being  of displaced children affected by violence and  armed conflict  during the  post displacement  phase include individual characteristics, family factors and  post migration  factors .  These are discussed below:"
"21" "Individual characteristics"
"22" "Age, gender and school enrollment /attendance  have been reported  to be associated  with the   well-being  of  children affected by violence and armed conflict .   Younger children     are likely   to have poorer mental health outcomes than  older  children   (Kohrt et al., 2010; Schwab-Stone et al., 1999)   while   m ales  are  likely to have   better  behavioral   outcomes  than    their  fe male counterparts   (Kohrt et al., 2010; Self-Brown et al., 2006) .   Humanitarian actors indicate that   s chools  are important in providing  adjustment and caring  opportunities    for  displaced and armed conflict    affected children   (Elbedour et al., 1993; Yule, 2002) .   S chool   retention   was positively associated with adaptive and  prosocial behavior  among former child soldiers in Sierra Leone  while school   attendance  was reported to  improve  psychosocial wellbeing among  former child  soldiers  in Nepal  (Betancourt et al., 2010; Kohrt et al., 2010) .   These findings highlight the  importance  of including  th ese  individual characteristics  in studying the  correlat ion  of  children’s perception of safety   for  armed  conflict-affected  children in  post displacement   phase."
"23" "Family Factors"
"24" "A n  influential  protective factor  that  has been emphasized  in literature  i s   the  family   (O'Neill, 2006) .    R esearch   has  consistently show n  a direct protective role of family factors for children  affected by armed conflict  (Lösel & Farrington, 2012) .   This includes positive parent - child relationship, low family conflict, and family socioeconomic status.   Quality  positive parent - child relationship is established as  a direct   protective factor for children psychosocial functioning  (Ackard et al., 2006; Kliewer et al., 2004; Resnick et al., 1997) .   For instance,   Klasen et al. (2010)  reported   that positive functioning was related with better parent - child relationship,   lower family conflict,  better family  socioeconomic status irrespective  of exposure  to war.  Cummings and Davies (2010)   established that family conflict and violence  have  negative influence  on  children’s  well-being .  In    a  longitudinal study with a   group    of 11-16 years  old    children in  Afghanistan  ,  family conflict  was  associated with  poor   mental health problems while  quality family  life   was found to be prot ective against  mental health problems  irrespective of  war related stress  experienced   (Panter-Brick et al., 2011) .   F amily  composition w as   not  significantly related   with    behavioral  and mental health   in Nepal ,   Bosnia and Herzegovina    among   conflict-affected  children   (Duraković‐Belko et al., 2003; Kohrt et al., 2010) .   It is therefore important  to investigate  these  family factors     in relation  to the   children’s perception of safety   for children affected by armed conflict."
"25" "Post migration  factor"
"26" "Although,  studies  with armed  conflict-affected  population  during the  post displacement  phase have ma inly  focused on  populations   displaced and  living in host countries and within camp settings , r elated post migration factors that have been reported includes daily stressors  of  living  in the host country  and  length of stay within the new community or country   (Ehntholt & Yule, 2006; Miller et al., 2006; Panter‐Brick et al., 2008; Rasmussen & Annan, 2009; Rasmussen et al., 2010) .  For instance,   Bogic et al. (2012)   reported varied  prevalence  rate  of mental health disorder among former  Yugoslavia refuges  across three different  countries .   Likewise,   Syrian refugees,  living in Turkey reported a  higher symptom  of PTSD and trauma  in  co m par i son  to Syrian  refugees living  in Sweden (Chung et al., 2018) .    Contextual, economic and cultural  factors ( such as  quality of  accommodation ,  feeling  of racism  or acceptance  in the host country,  poor social status ,   and administrative  diffic ulties) within the host countries may be responsible  for the  variations in  the  well-being  of the displaced population  (Bogic et al., 2012; Porter & Haslam, 2005; Silove et al., 1997; Tay et al., 2019) ."
"27" "Regarding  length of stay within the host country or community, evidences from  literature  are  mixed. For instance,  a study with Vietnamese refugee in Australia revealed better mental health with longer stay in Australia  (Steel et al., 2002) , whereas  study with  I raqi refugees reported  poorer mental health with longer stay in Australia (Guajardo et al., 2016) .Considering the   population focus  (mainly refugees)and disparities reported   about length of stay within the communities  in previous studies  it is essential to  investigate the associations between length of stay within the community and   children’s perception of safety  for children displaced by armed conflict during the post displacement stage."
"28" "Gaps in Literature"
"29" "Most  studies  on protec tive and risk   factors    for children affected by  violent and  armed    conflict    have   focused  on  negative   indicators    of  well-being   such as  mental health  distress  and  behavioral  problems   with  limited knowledge about    children’s perception of safety   (Ben-Arieh & Shimon, 2014; Sabina & Banyard, 2015) .  Despite the reported  importance of  children’s perception of safety  for children  affected by conflict , we did not find any study on  children’s perception of safety  for children affected by armed conflict.   In fact, most of the literature reported in this study were focused on mental health distress.   Furthermore, factors that are protective for one aspect of well-being domain or outcome (e.g., cognitive functioning) may not be protective for another  domain of well-being or outcome (e.g., mental health)  (Kliewer et al., 2004; Luthar et al., 2000) .  This is essential to consider as p revious studies have  rep o rted  heterogeneity   in children  functioning across different wellbeing domains  at the same point in   their  development   (Wright et al., 2013) .  For  example ,  a group of high risk adolescent were found to have  poor  psychological wellbeing   despite their high levels of social  adjustment   (Luthar, 1991) .   In addition , each phase of conflict and displacement entails distinct stressors,   with  responses and coping strategies vary ing  for children  (Lustig et al., 2004) .  More s pecifically,   less is  known  about  sociodemographic   and family  factors that  are  associated   with     children’s  perception of safety  for  internally  displaced  children  living in  a developing country  during the  post displacement  phase   (Betancourt & Khan, 2008) ."
"30" "Current study"
"31" "The purpose of the current study was exploratory and   descriptive. We aim  to fill the gap in literature by examin ing  the relationship between  family  factors,   individual  characteristics , length of stay in the community   and    children’s  perception of safety   within the neighborhood  among  internally   displaced  children  affected by  armed  conflict during the early  post displacement  phase in  North-East  Nigeria.  Early post displacement in this study refers to communities that experienced armed conflict and community members were displaced due to the conflict but were now being resettled back into their original communities .   A ll the children in our study  population  were  homogen ous in ethnic ity  and cultural identity  liv ing  within homogenous  rural  communities .   However,   the  families may  differ from each other in terms of (1) socioeconomic aspects, (2) family  composition  and (3) family  interactions  and (4)  length of stay in the community  after  the  displacement .  We assessed length of stay as a post migration factor because our study population were internally displaced were returnees (displaced persons  returning back  to their place of  original  settlement). It was not applicable for us to measure contextual and cultural factors of living in host communities as indicated in previous studies.  In addition, we assessed for  children’s perception of safety  within the neighborhood because the children’s daily interactions were within their communities. For instance, all schools were within the neighborhood but not all school age children were enrolled in school. Therefore, we could not assess for  children’s perception of safety  for different settings (e.   g school)."
"32" "We therefore examine the  relationship between  individual characteristics,   family characteristics   (family size, household type, sex of household head and relationship to household head) , family  functioning  (family  conflict  and parent-child relationship),  family  social economic status, and length of stay on  children’s perception of  safety within  their neighborhood.  Based  on the limited literature on  children’s perception of safety  or conflict affected childre n we develop t hree research to help us achieve the purpose of the research.  The f irst research question was to examine which individual characteristics (age, gender, enrollment in school) were related to perception for safety. The second research question was to investigate association between family composition  (family size, household type, sex of household head and relationship to household head) , socioeconomic status ,  family  functioning  variables  (parent child relationship and  family conflict )  and  children’s perception of safety  within the neighborhood . Our third question was to investigate the contribution of length of stay within the community  to children’s perception  of safety  within the  neighborhood ."
"33" "Method"
"34" "Study Setting"
"35" "In  North-East  of Nigeria (the current setting of this study), the Insurgency armed conflict which started since 2009 has affected about 7.1 million people of which 61% are children (IDMC,  2019; UNOCHA, 2018). The Boko Harm insurgency included armed attacks, kidnapping of school children within school premises, use of explosives, destruction of properties and buildings, massive killings, and disruption of regular daily activities (Adebayo, 2014; Akinola, 2015) .  The conflict-affected persons have experienced violence, displacement, loss of or separation from family members, loss and destruction of property, deterioration of living conditions, disruption of livelihoods, accumulated stress, and weakened coping capacities with about 2 million people internally displaced (UNOCHA, 2018).  Internally displaced persons (IDPs) are 'persons or groups of people who have been forced or obliged to flee or leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of, or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflicts, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized state border' (Kalin, 2008) .    At the time of this study, Nigeria internally displaced persons(IDPs) were beginning to return to accessible areas regained by the Nigeria military (UNOCHA, 2018) . This study was conducted in some of the accessible locations of Bornu and Adamawa state   where the displaced persons had  returned back  to their original community ."
"36" "Study design"
"37" "A cross sectional descriptive survey was used in this study.   The sample  selected  was  384  ( 170 males and  214 females)  aged 7-18years   (Mean = 12.90 years SD =2.97) .   87.5  % were  enrolled school children  and 12.5% were non enrolled  school  children  recruited from six rural  communities in  early stages of post displacement recovery in Adamawa and Bornu state Nigeria.   All the communities in this study  had  experienced armed  conflict ,   community members were displaced during the conflict period  and had  returned back  to their original  community .  Sample size was calculated based on estimates of the time available to administer the survey within the  time frame of the study  within each  community  because  no records or register of the study population were available . The  sampling involved ( i ) P urposive select ion of study sites  based on security  reasons and  ease of  access   from locations where  Tearfund and CRUDAN , a non-governmental organization carried out Food, livelihood support (FSL) and Water sanitation and hygiene (WASH) activities .  (ii) Random selection of children within selected study sites  in discussion with community leaders and school administrators .  The survey was carried out during school hours in order to capture enrolled and  non-enrolled  school  children within the communities . Children who were enrolled in school   were randomly selected from  all  schools   within each of the  communities  with the assistance of the  school administrator  (all the communities had one or two school).  The school administrator selected students with a random numbering within the classes in the school.    N on-enrolled   school  children   were  selected from  households with  non-enrolled  school children  by the  community leaders."
"38" "Procedure"
"39" "Ethical clearance was obtained from University of Antwerp Ethics Committee for Social Science and Humanities, and National Emergency Management Agency (NEMA) Nigeria. Written informed consent was obtained for all study participants from adult caregivers after which we obtained oral consent from each child before participating in the study. There was no child or caregiver that objected to participate in the study as community members thought that the  survey might  result into a humanitarian aid afterwards,  and we clearly explained that the study would not generate any humanitarian aid  before their consent were given . No incentives were offered to study participants. Information sheets were given to all participant in Hausa pidgin (local language) and English. No names were obtained or recorded.    The surveys were administered by research assistants that had previous experience conducting research with children.  In addition,   r esearch assistants were trained on ethical issues and administration of the questionnaire to children before the pretest of the instruments.  P articipants were informed at the time of data collection that their answers were anonymous, confidential, and voluntary."
"40" "Measures"
"41" "We use a  pretest ed  questionnaire that was adapted and customized from     previous studies   (Foster, 2015)  with refugees within a host community .  The questionnaires were back translated into local (Hausa pidgin) language and pretested.  The  questionnaire  was   adapted   to   fit  the   cultural  environmental context of the study participants.   Items within the questionnaire were  validated  with local  research team  and  humanitarian workers within the study  location.  The pretest survey was conducted  within a  displacement  camp settlem ent  not included in this study .   After the pretest, corrections were made to the survey instrument, potential challenges on the field and associated solutions were also explored."
"42" "The  independent variables  include :"
"43" "Individual  characteristics :  This includes   gender, age ,   enrollment in  school and education  level .  Bei n g enrolled in school is coded as 1,  non-enrollment =0 . Female coded as 0, male as1."
"44" "Family  composition: Includes  Household type  ( extended, monogamous and polygamous family ), sex of household head, relationship to household head (biological parents , grandparents, child headed  and others),  Household size  in number ."
"45" "S ocioeconomic status :  This was captured by two  variables because it was impossible to access the family income level and parent educational attainment from the children.   They include  ( i ) Household assets assessed by household property ownership adapted from  Foster (2015)   ( ownership  of   motorcycle or car ,  ownership  of  television ,  ownership  o f a   personal  designated  toilet, absence of broken doors and windows, ownership of adequate sanitation and cooking utensils) .    These indicators were used because most  conflict-affected  households had lost their  livelihood and  were majorly peasant farmers .  Higher score on the household assets indicated more assets.  (ii)  Economic stress   adapt ed from  Foster (2015)   was measured by frequency of inadequate food at home, housing and clothing  and  sleeping hungry at night because of no food  withi n the  past four weeks  as never, sometimes, most of the time, always) ."
"46" "Frequency of  family conflict  assessed by “ Do you ever notice  fighting/ yelling   /  arguing in your home ” a 5-point item ( None of the time, A little of the time, Some of the time, Most of the time, All of the time ) (Foster, 2015)"
"47" "P arent-child relationship  measured  using   the “ positive  relationship with parent for teenagers scale”  (PerformWell, 2015)   . The positive parent child relationship scale   is  a 6 items scale on a 5-point  Likert  score ranging from 0 to 4, with a  Cronbach  alpha of 0.91 with h igher scores i ndicating  better positive relationships .   Scores for the parent child relationship scale were summed during the analysis."
"48" "Length of stay within the  community was  assessed as  “ how long  you have  been residing within the community ”  as a binary question of less than a year and more than  a year  option. This was used  because  s tudy sites  were  newly resettled  communities after the arm ed  conflict."
"49" "Our dependent variables   children’s perception of safety  within the neighborhood was assessed by a  single  4 point   score  question  adapted from a previous study  (Foster, 2015) “Do you feel safe in your neighborhood  ?”( I feel safe always, I feel safe most of the time, I feel safe sometimes, I do not feel safe ) .On a scale of  1  to 4 with higher score indicating better  children’s perception of safety ."
"50" "Data Analysis"
"51" "Data analysis w as  performed using the IBM SPSS version 20 and descriptive analysis was used to present all the variables.     Analysis of variance  (ANOVA) test , Fishers test and chi test  (depending on the characteristics of the variable)  w as  conducted  with all the independent variables  to  compare   children’s  perception  of safety within the neighborhood based on all the independent variables. Afterwards, an ordinal  logistic regression  analyses was conducted to  study the  relationship children’s  perception of safety within the neighborhoo d and the  independent variables .  Furthermore, we  tested for differences in family factors with regards to length of stay within the community with chi test, independent test and F- test. This was to allow for better interpretation of the  contribution of length of stay within the community on children’s perception of safety."
"52" "T his study is a imed  at  the following research questions  in the result section below :"
"53" "(1)   T o examine which individual characteristics (age, gender, enrollment in school)  are   related to perception for safety."
"54" "(2)   T o investigate association s  between family composition  (family size, household type, sex of household head and relationship to household head) , socioeconomic status, family  functioning  variables (parent child relationship and family conflict) and children’s perception of safety within the neighborhood."
"55" "(3)   T o investigate the contribution of length of stay within the community to children’s perception of safety within the neighborhood."

Our study consists of 384 respondents (44. 3 % males and 55. 7  % females) aged 7-18years (Mean = 12.90 years SD =2.97). 72.5% lived in male headed household with a mean  Household size  of 5.5. 72.5% lived less than a year within the community. Most of the children (87.5 %) w ere  enrolled in school. The positive parent-child relationship mean score is 3.26 (SD 0.80) on a scale of 5 point. The mean score for  children’s perception of safety  was 3.00 (SD 0.93) and household assets mean score is ranged from 0 to 4 with a mean score of 2.00 (SD=1.32).  Details are in table 1."

The assumption of proportional odds  assessed  by a full likelihood ratio test  was not met ,   χ2( 42 ) = 8 7 . 049 ,  p  < .0 5 . However ,   t he final model   containing all the predictors was  statistically significantly, χ2( 31 ) =  118 . 398 ,  p  < .001   with    Nagelkerke  R²   at 0. 312 .   Table  3  provides an overview of the  ordinal logistic regression result ."
"360" "Individual  charac teristics and  children ’s  perception for safety"
"361" "The  regression  result further affirms that there  is  no significant association between  age , gender and school enrollment  and  children’s perception of safety .  Age, gender and enrollment in school  did not predict children’s perception of safety."
"362" "Family factors and children children’s perception for safety"
"363" "In keeping with research question 2,   the  cumulative  ordinal logistic regression showed  that  none of the family composition variables were associated with children’s perception of safety,   lower  household  economic stress was positively associated with  children’s perception of safety while all the family functioning variables  ( family conflict and parent child relationship)  were related   to children’s perception of safety .   Children with lower frequency of family conflict a n d  children with higher parent child relationship were l ikely to feel safer respectively."
"364" "The odds ratio  of  childr en being in the higher category of  perception of safety   f or  household with  lower  economic stress versus household with high economic stress   is   χ2( 1 ) =  12 . 882 ,  p   =  .0 00 . The frequency of family conflic t  had a statistically significant effect on   children’s perception of safety ,   χ2( 4 ) =  2 1 . 516 ,  p   =  .0 00. An increase in parent child relationship score   was associated with an increase in   the odds of  children feeling safe  with an odds ratio of  1.083   ( 95% CI , 1.034  to  1.133 ) ,   χ2( 4 ) =  1 1 . 661 ,  p   =  .0 0 1."

"654" "Previous studies  with children   affected by arm-conflict  have  focused mainly on negative  indicators of  well-being  majorly including mental health and  behavioral  problems   (Tol et al., 2013) . In this study we examine  sociodemographic  and family factors associated  with   children’s perception of safety  for children affected by conflict in rural areas. Our   f indings demonstrate that parent-child relationship,  frequency  of  family  conflict , economic stress,  and  length of stay  within the community  are factors that are related to  children’s perception of safety  for children living in  post displacement  setting .      This is similar to   previous  studies   on  mental health problems  for conflict and violence affected children ,  our  findings  emphasize   th e  r elations between  family  f actors   variables , length of stay (a post migration factor)   and   children’s perception of safety   for children     affected  by conflict and violence   (Kliewer et al., 1994; O'Neal, 2001; Panter-Brick et al., 2011; Tol et al., 2013)"
"655" "T he family contributes significantly to  children’s perception of safety  for children.  More family variables  from this study ,   were found to be  strongly  associated with  children’s perception of safety .    We found only  the family   dynamics  variable s ( family  conflict ,  economic stress  and parent-child relationship)   to be  significant ly associated   with   children’s perception of safety  for children.    Consistent  w ith   Kohrt et al. (2010)  and   Duraković‐Belko et al.  (2003)   w e did not find  concrete association with the family composition   (size, relationship to  household head,   sex of household head and family structure)  variables.   Children who had a better parent-child relationship   wou ld  likely feel safer than children  with lesser parent child relationship  within their neighborhood. This  is also in line with  previous studies that associate positive parent-child relationship and proper family functioning as protective factors for better children outcomes  irrespective of exposure to conflict and violence  (Aceves & Cookston, 2007; Hardaway et al., 2012; Joshi & O'donnell, 2003; Qouta et al., 2008; Sim et al., 2018; Timshel et al., 2017) .  In addition , we also  observed  the detrimental effects of  family  conflict  for  children’s perception of safety  for children .   Children from families with lesser frequency of family conflict were likely to have higher  children’s perception of safety .  Similar findings have been     reported  in   previous  studies  (Holt et al., 2008; Panter-Brick et al., 2011) .    Like previous studies,   family  e conomic stress   w as  found to be    significant   associated  with  lesser feelings  of safety  in children  (Bonanno, 2004; Côté-Lussier et al., 2015; Farhood et al., 1993; Klasen et al., 2010)   .     Lesser economic  stress of meeting basic needs   within the family  is associated with higher  children’s perception of safety  for the children within our study."
"656" "In addition, the length of stay within the neighborhood was significant for the  children’s perception of safety  for children both within the neighborhood. Children from families who had stayed longer felt  safer  than others.  However,  our  test of associations   suggest   daily stress levels may subsidies as family stay longer within the community with the possibility of establishment within the community .  T his   is because   we f ound   associations between  family conflict ,   living  i n  extended family  type   and parent-child relationship  among children that had lived longer within the community."
"657" "Conclusively, our results affirm the importance of the family in improving the  children’s perception of safety  for children. Family factors which include the parent-child relationship, economic stress, and family conflict are factors that are associated with  children’s perception of safety  for children within the neighborhood."
"658" "However,   o ur study  has several  limitations.  The study  was  self-report  cross   sectional survey .  D ata collected depended on the  participants ’ sincerity and  casual  relationships between  the variables cannot be established .    There was no  of information on the degree  and time  of exposure to conflict  as  s ome studies suggests that the timing of  violence exposure is associated to children wellbeing   (Brandt et al., 2005) . Perceptions of safety  may    also  likely vary based on levels of exposure to violence and there may be variability in exposure to violence even within this study’s context.   The purpos iv e s ampling  method  and  method of  sample  size calculation used  th is  study may  also  limit  the  generalizability of our study results .   These  limit ation demands for   caution in  the conclusion that should be drawn from this study and our results should be interpreted with caution."
"659" "Our  result  has  some implications for practice  and policy as it is important  for children to  feel safe to  appropriately to  mitigate the impact of conflict .  We  emphasize the importance  of implementing and designing family-based interventions  establishing feelings of safety for children .  Providers of services to conflict affected children may in volve  their families or  include   parenting  program  in the delivery of interventions to children.  Intervention in  post displacement  communities needs to be more specific to family needs with attention  being  given to  improv ing   family  functioning  factors .   Secondly,   h umanitarian interventions may be designed to help improve the level of social support available to families within the community.   Programs could involve opportunities for families to build  social networks within their communities.  It is also necessary to pay more attention to newly resettled conflict-affected children and families in the administration of humanitarian aids.    Future research should give attention to the impact of conflict and displacement on family functioning  with the aim to examine how individual, family and environmental factors influence family process during displacement and conflicts  (Sim et al., 2018) . Research could also benefit from the inclusion of parents and caregivers. Additional longitudinal studies and qualitative research is needed to provide full clarification on factors that  improves the  children’s perception of safety .   In summary,  we  suggest the need for multisectoral intervention that promotes economic strengthening, better parent-child relationship and improved social support for more sustainable impact in  post displacement  communities."
