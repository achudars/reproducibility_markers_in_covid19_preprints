Is Europe becoming a ‘gerontocracy’ ? New evidence on
age cleavages in Europe since the 1980s
Tom O’Grady∗
July 2, 2020
Abstract
This paper asks how strong the evidence is for a large and growing age cleavage in
European politics and a political system that is increasingly dominated by the elderly,
using new estimates of the ideological positions of different age groups in 27 European
countries across four issue domains from 1981-2016. The young turn out to be much
more socially liberal than the old in most countries, but also more opposed to taxation
and government spending. Age divides are generally no larger now than they were
thirty years ago, are explained primarily by cohort replacement effects, and are likely
to fall in the near future. Nonetheless, age divides in voting are large and in some
places actually increasing. A likely explanation is that, although age-based ideological
differences are not new, parties have increasingly emerged and polarised along the
dimensions where the young and old have long differed from each other.

Europe’s population is ageing. By 2100 the over-65s will account for 31% of its population,
compared to 20% today and 10% in the mid 1980s.1 Some argue that this demographic shift
is being accompanied by a political revolution. Journalists often claim that an age cleavage
is replacing older divides over class and religion in European politics. This cleavage is said
to lie behind the rise of new parties in Europe, and with large age differences in turnout, it
has long been claimed that Europe is set to become a ‘gerontocracy’ - a political system run
by, and in the interests of, the elderly (e.g. Sinn and Uebelmesser 2003).
Are some of the world’s oldest democracies being transformed by elderly voters, and
will they be transformed further in the future? There are very large and (in some countries)
growing age divides for voting. Young voters have formed a core part of the coalition for new
and transformed parties of the left such as Podemos in Spain and Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour
party in the UK (Ramiro and Gomez 2017; Sloam, Ehsan, and Henn 2018). Generational
differences in voting combine with shifts of young people away from rural areas and into
cities to amplify the electoral effect of age, exacerbating urban-rural divides (Rodden 2019).
In Germany, for instance, nineteen of Europe’s twenty oldest regions are in the East, the
heartland of Alternative für Deutschland.2 , while its younger cities in the west increasingly
vote for the Green Party. A key question remains, though: are age divides in voting a
bottom-up phenomenon, with the old and young more ideologically polarised than they
were in the past? Or are they explained more by changes in the supply of parties?
On issues such as housing, public pension spending and the environment, young voters
sometimes appear to be losing out to the old, and there is strong evidence that younger
Europeans feel alienated from formal electoral politics (Cammaerts et al. 2014; Sloam 2013).
But if Europe is truly becoming a gerontocracy, with the elderly skewing policies towards
their preferences, then old and young voters must have strongly divergent opinions. If age
groups are more distinctive today than in the past, then age differences in opinions must
have substantially widened over time. And if age gaps are to be maintained in future as

Europe’s population ages, they must be caused by a genuine effect of ageing itself, not by
cohort differences or period effects that will eventually dissipate.
This begs three questions that this paper answers. First, are there ideological age cleavages in Europe, and if so, on which issue dimensions? Second, for how long have they existed?
Third, are they likely to be a temporary or permanent feature of European politics? Existing
evidence on these questions is both imperfect and incomplete. Due to the sparse and uneven
availability of opinion data over time and across countries, most studies have focused only
on short periods, a handful of countries at most, or a narrow set of issues. This makes it
hard to know whether a given study’s findings are generalisable. The lack of long-term data
also complicates the task of judging whether age differences are due to age, period or cohort
effects. To overcome these problems I use a new dataset with much wider coverage across
issues that captures the opinions of Europeans in twenty-seven countries from 1981-2016,
as well as a new scaling method that aggregates the questions into four dimension-specific
ideological scales for age groups developed by Caughey, O’Grady, and Warshaw (2019).
This provides a comprehensive picture of European age cleavages across, time, issues and
countries, as well as new insights into their likely future evolution.
I find that since the 1980s all age groups have become more socially liberal and proimmigration. However age gaps, although large, have not risen since the 1980s and if anything
are starting to fall, particularly in Northern and Central European countries. These patterns
are explained by cohort replacement via increasingly socially liberal cohorts, combined with
some period effects. On tax and spending, an age gap has opened up in the last fifteen years.
But in contrast to media narratives of increasingly socialist millennials, here the young are
more conservative than the old, and period effects dominate. Europe is unlikely to become
a gerontocracy, because today’s middle-aged will not be very distinctive on immigration and
social issues when they become tomorrow’s elderly. Dramatic recent changes in voting by
age have probably been caused by parties polarising on issues where age gaps in ideology
have been large since at least the 1980s, rather than by rising age differences amongst voters.

1. Ageing and Ideology: Existing Theory and Evidence
European countries have aged, and are set to age much further. There is also no doubt
that in recent years, the old have turned out to vote more than the young (Goerres 2007).
Beyond this though, journalists’ accounts of age divides in European politics typically focus
on small pieces of anecdotal evidence to justify claims that age is the main driver of political
behaviour in Europe. The UK, which experienced a dramatic widening of age differences in
voting from 2015 onwards, is a prime example. Writing in the aftermath of the 2017 UK
General election, the Economist claimed that: “the biggest political divide in Britain is age.
Forget Brexit, class and education. This election has pitted the young against the old.”3
Around the same time, a columnist in the Independent claimed that “politics is being taken
over by children with a pipe dream of returning to the socialism I know doesn’t work.”4
The existing academic evidence on age and ideology, although extensive, is fragmentary
and imperfect. One body of work from psychology and political behaviour discusses the
general relationship between ageing and opinions. A second set of studies looks primarily at
social attitudes and their relationship to economic growth. A third, from political economy,
asks whether the elderly are skewing public spending toward their priorities.

Theories from Social Psychology and Political Behaviour
It is widely assumed that conservatism rises with age - at least on non-economic issues due to changes in personality and cognition that occur naturally as people age. Ageing may
lead to lower openness to new ideas as well as increased need for closure: a preference for
certainty over ambiguity (Franssen, Dhont, and Van Hiel 2013). These traits are strongly
related to social conservatism (Cornelis et al. 2009).5 However, although on average older
people’s opinions are less malleable than the young, it does not necessarily follow that people

will become more conservative as they age. It makes little sense to claim that the elderly
are more resistant to change, but also more likely to become more conservative over time.
Instead, their views often simply reflect the opinions they formed when younger, in their
‘impressionable years’ when people’s minds are more likely to change (Dinas 2013). Empirical
evidence from long-term panel data supports the view that opinions formed when young tend
to be long-lasting (Sears and Funk 1999; Peterson, Smith, and Hibbing 2020). Differences
in opinion that might appear to be caused by age are in fact often generational in origin.
The stickiness of opinions as people age is probably also due to the differential occurrence
of major life events. Young people often leave home, begin new careers, enter long-term
relationships or start a family, all of which can lead them to reconsider their opinions. Older
people can appear more stuck in their ways simply because they are less likely to experience
major life events that expose them to new ideas and ways of thinking (Visser and Krosnick
1998). Elderly people are in fact perfectly capable of changing their views, even becoming
more socially liberal. On social issues where many groups in society have rapidly changed
their opinions, such as racial equality or women’s and LGBT rights, the elderly have often
liberalised as quickly as younger people (Danigelis, Hardy, and Cutler 2007).
As Peterson, Smith, and Hibbing (2020) point out, there is therefore a disconnect between
social psychology – claiming that ageing leads to personality changes that cause greater
conservatism – and political science, emphasising attitudinal stability over the lifespan.

The ‘Silent Revolution’ in Social Issues
The ‘silent revolution’ theory argues that older people in recent years are more socially
conservative than the young due to cohort and period effects, not differences inherent to the
ageing process. Younger generations have been socialized in a more affluent and liberal era
when concerns for social equality and post-material values are much more salient (Inglehart
1990; Grasso et al. 2017). Norris and Inglehart (2019) also argue that a backlash against
this progressive social change has begun to occur amongst older voters.
5

Empirical work has generally supported this theory. The young are more socially liberal
than their elders and European citizens have become more socially liberal over time, placing a
higher priority on ‘postmaterial’ concerns than in the past. Comparative work has found that
cohort effects appear to be the dominant driver of change, with substantial period effects too
as all cohorts have liberalized over time (Andor, Schmidt, and Sommer 2018; Inglehart 2008;
Norris and Inglehart 2019). Evidence from Canada, the USA and the UK shows similar
patterns for individual issue areas including homosexuality and marriage equality, gender
equality, marijuana legalisation, authoritarian values, the death penalty, and racial equality
(Andersen and Fetner 2008; Baunach 2011; Cotter, Hermsen, and Vanneman 2011; Danigelis,
Hardy, and Cutler 2007; Grasso et al. 2017; Peterson, Smith, and Hibbing 2020; Scott,
Alwin, and Braun 1996; Tilley 2005; Twenge, Carter, and Campbell 2015). To the author’s
knowledge, no existing studies have examined age differences in support for immigration,
even though the Silent Revolution theory predicts declining nationalist sentiment as countries
become wealthier. Some cross-national work has shown that younger Europeans are more
supportive of the related issue of European integration, primarily due to cohort effects,
although not in Southern European countries (Lauterbach and de Vries 2020).
Most of these findings come from single countries, because cross-national survey data is
sparse, making long-term comparisons across time and countries difficult. Even studies of
multiple countries typically cover short periods. For instance, Norris and Inglehart (2019)
and Lauterbach and de Vries (2020) use European Social Survey data from 2002-14 and
2002-16 only. Otherwise, evidence from the UK and the US alone predominates. They are
unusual in having high-quality national social surveys going back several decades.

‘Grey Peril’ ? Age and Attitudes to Public Spending
On economic issues, age-based differences might arise from self-interest. In theory the elderly have a stronger interest in higher spending on pensions and healthcare, and decreased
spending on education (Poterba 1997; Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin 1999). Depictions of ‘grey
6

peril’ or a ’grey tide’ therefore paint the elderly as a group whose views on economic issues
place them naturally at odds with the young (Hess, Nauman, and Steinkopf 2017). The
reality is more nuanced. The young may support spending on pensions and healthcare just
as much as the elderly. Pensioners are popular and are seen as more deserving than other
recipients of government largesse such as the unemployed (Mulligan and Sala-i-Martin 1999;
Sorensen 2013). Everyone also expects to be old or sick one day, giving them a long-term
interest in strong pensions and health provision. Since the elderly can’t become young, they
lack a long-term self-interest in education spending, potentially making age-based conflict
larger for education (Sorensen 2013). Even so, the elderly often have family members who
benefit from good schools, and well-funded local schools can raise property prices, boosting
the elderly’s assets (Brunner and Balsdon 2004).
In line with this mixed theoretical picture, there is best limited empirical evidence for
age wars over economic issues. Although age divides exist over spending on pensions and
healthcare, they are typically very small and are lower than for other characteristics such
as class, income or race. This is true both in cross-country studies (Busemeyer, Goerres,
and Weschle 2009; Fernandez and Jaime-Castillo 2013; Hess, Nauman, and Steinkopf 2017;
Sorensen 2013) and single-country studies, which have focused on the USA (Street and
Cossman 2006; Fullerton and Dixon 2010).6 Age differences appear to be a little larger
when it comes to education spending or support for publicly-provided childcare. Again,
this is true both across countries (Busemeyer, Goerres, and Weschle 2009; Mello et al. 2017;
Sorensen 2013) and for single European countries, notably Germany (Goerres and Tepe 2012)
and Switzerland (Cattaneo and Wolter 2009). Age effects are minimal, and cohort effects
dominate (Sorensen 2013; Street and Cossman 2006; Fullerton and Dixon 2010).
Again though, it is diffficult to derive general conclusions about age conflict in Europe
from these studies. The cross-country studies generally focus on only a handful of survey
questions in a single year: Busemeyer, Goerres, and Weschle (2009) examine four survey

questions from 1996, Fernandez and Jaime-Castillo (2013) examine three questions from
2006, Mello et al. (2017) examine four questions from 2010, Hess, Nauman, and Steinkopf
(2017) examine two questions from 2009, and Sorensen (2013) looks at three survey questions
on four occasions: 1985, 1990, 1996 and 2006. The culprit, again, is a lack of survey questions
repeated consistently across time and countries.

Age and Ideology in Europe: What we do not know
At the start of this paper I posed three questions about ideology – is there an age cleavage in
terms of attitudes, and if so, on which issues? For how long have cleavages existed? And are
age cleavages likely to be a temporary or permanent feature of European politics? Clearly,
the existing evidence that we have to answer these questions is fragmented and incomplete,
making it difficult to adjudicate between different theories. To distinguish age, period and
cohort effects – and therefore to tell whether age gaps are due to something inherent to the
ageing process or to cohort replacement, as the silent revolution theory predicts – the same
cohorts must be observed on multiple occasions. Since cohorts are generally defined as those
born in particular decades or half-decades, this requires longitudinal data covering several
decades. The inability to distinguish cohort or period effects from ageing effects also makes
forecasting the future evolution of age cleavages difficult. If ageing itself leads to greater
conservatism, then we should expect age gaps to be maintained as Europe’s population ages
further in future. If instead any gaps are due to cohort effects, then age cleavages need not
continue indefinitely. They will depend on how similar the socialisation experiences are of
cohorts. Likewise, a lack of data covering multiple time periods makes it hard to examine
period effects, which by definition affect opinions in certain periods but not others.
It is also hard to generalise from these studies. Each one typically features only a handful
of survey items in a single year. The results could be specific to the particular items or survey
year being examined. Although single-country studies can cover more survey questions and
years, they come from only a small number of non-randomly-selected countries (notably the
8

UK and USA) that happen to have high-quality long-term repeated surveys. This may skew
our picture of age cleavages. One possibility is that countries with lower dependency ratios
could feature lower age-based conflict (Emery 2012), and the UK and USA do in fact have
less ageing populations than some other developed countries.
Finally, we cannot easily compare across countries and issue dimensions. With so few
long-term cross-national studies, we lack evidence on whether certain groups of countries
exhibit larger age gaps, and how these have evolved over time. For example, an implication
of the ’silent revolution’ theory is that countries at an earlier stage of economic development
should have smaller age gaps on social issues, since postmaterial values should arise in
younger cohorts only after a certain degree of wealth has been reached. Likewise, the two sets
of literature – focused on social issues and on economic conflict – have grown up separately
from each other. No existing studies compare age differences across dimensions.

2. Data and Methods
To answer the three questions set out at the start of this paper, I present a much more
comprehensive picture of age difference in ideology in Europe, using a new method developed
by Caughey, O’Grady, and Warshaw (2019) and implemented via the dgo package in R
(Dunham, Caughey, and Warshaw 2017), which converts sets of survey questions into scaled
ideological positions for subgroups within multiple European countries. This estimates item
response theory (IRT) models using survey questions, but differs from previous IRT models
in two respects. First, it estimates ideological positions for groups (e.g. age groups within
a country) rather than individuals. This facilitates estimating scales for age-country groups
even in years with the handful of questions within a given dimension that are typical of crossnational surveys, when an IRT model for individuals would fail due to lack of data. Second, it
smooths the estimated ideological positions using a hierarchical model so that country-years
with little or no survey data borrow information from other periods and places. This allows

9

the model to produce estimates in years when survey data are very sparse or even unavailable
altogether. Together, these features surmount the problem of sparse and unevenly available
European survey data. The model used in this paper is identical to Caughey, O’Grady, and
Warshaw (2019), which contains extensive information on its estimation and validation.
Underlying the estimated scales are over 100 individual survey questions across a wide
range of issues. They are taken from every existing cross-national survey undertaken in
Europe, including the European Social Survey, ISSP modules and the World Values Survey
from 1981-2016. A total of twenty-seven European countries are included. To allow for comparisons across dimensions, I follow Caughey, O’Grady, and Warshaw (2019) in estimating
scales for four dimensions, each one estimated from a different set of survey questions. All
surveys and survey questions are identical to those used in Caughey, O’Grady, and Warshaw
(2019). This paper’s Supplementary Information reproduces part of their supplementary information, providing extensive information on the surveys and survey questions used.
The first scale is labeled social and refers to social and post-material issues such as the
environment, abortion, gender equality and LGBT rights. The second is immigration and
includes questions on immigration and nationalism. The third is labeled relative economic
issues and is akin to ‘mood’ (Stimson 1991), using questions that refer to the economic policy
status quo, primarily the desire for higher vs. lower taxes and government spending. The
fourth is absolute economic issues, using questions that ask about economic policy principles,
such as the desirability of redistribution in theory. Survey questions about economics are
separated into these two scales because the differential policy status quo across countries
means their positions on the relative scale, but not the absolute scale, may reflect existing
policy differences as much as ideological beliefs.7
7. The scales for the other three issue areas do not contain any questions that reference a status quo.
For the relative economic measure, some caution is warranted in interpreting differences in age gaps across
countries, which can be influenced by differences in policies. The same point applies to all previous crosscountry studies of age differences in support for pension spending, health spending, etc. This highlights the

10

To maximize the availability of survey data for each observation, the scales are estimated
for two-year periods. They therefore show how left-wing or right-wing different age groups
have been every two years since the 1980s, across four issue dimensions and twenty-seven
European countries, based on their stated policy preferences. The choice of age groups
was informed by feasibility as well as the requirements of age-period-cohort analysis. With
around one million individual survey items each and many parameters to estimate, in estimating these models there is a tradeoff between computational complexity and the number
of age categories for whom one can estimate ideological positions. There would also be high
uncertainty associated with the positions of fine-grained age groups, for whom there may
be few survey observations in a given country and period. I therefore estimated ideological
positions for six age categories of ten years each: those aged 18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, 58-67
and 68-77. The old are cut off at 77 so as to create groups of equal sizes. This is crucial in
allowing a comparison of cohorts over time, as shown below, and in practice there are few
survey respondents over 77. The estimates start in 1981-82 for social and absolute economic
issues, and in 1985-6 and 1989-90 respectively for relative economic issues and immigration,
as these are the first periods in which any survey data are available.

3. Age and Ideology in Europe
General Patterns over Time
Figure 1 shows the basic results by age category for each of the four ideological scales.8 These
show age groups rather than generational cohorts (cohorts and age-period-cohort analysis are
value of separating out questions about more abstract economic ideological principles.
8. These are not weighted by each country’s population size; Figure 2 below examines differences across
countries. Each model was estimated using four chains with 2000 iterations each, with the first half of each
chain as warmup. All conventional diagnostic tools, such as Gelman-Rubin statistics, indicated that each
model reached convergence.

11

discussed in the next section). All survey questions were re-coded so that higher response
values indicate more conservative opinions, meaning that higher values on the ideological
dimensions always represent greater conservatism, e.g. opposition to redistribution, tax and
spending, gender equality or immigration. The scales are each identified by setting ideology
to have a mean of zero and variance of one across groups and periods.
A broad liberalisation of opinion on social issues is clear across all six age categories.
This reflects increasing support for gender equality and LGBT rights, amongst other issues.
Big differences by age are also evident. But in contrast to stories of increasing age wars,
the ideological gap has changed little over time between the youngest and oldest cohorts,
and has narrowed considerably between the young and middle-aged. The youngest four age
groups are becoming increasingly indistinguishable. There was less aggregate change in views
about immigration, with the European public somewhat more pro-immigration now than it
was in 1989-90. This more modest aggregate change goes hand-in-hand with a substantial
but slightly smaller age gradient, which has also changed little over time. These ideological
differences on social issues and immigration by age are relatively large but are far from a
new feature of European politics, being no larger today than they were thirty-five years ago.
For economics, the picture is very different. There is little evidence of aggregate ideological change for absolute economic issues since the late 1980s, other than a quickly-reversed
liberalisation after the financial crisis. For relative economic issues, the European public
has become a little more supportive of taxing and spending since the turn of the century,
despite some increases in conservatism in the last few years. Age differences are either nonexistent or the opposite of the pattern for social issues and immigration. Until very recently,
the young were somewhat more conservative than the old in absolute terms, but age gaps
have narrowed to virtually nothing today. They have increased over time for relative conservatism, with the young now more opposed to taxing and spending than the elderly. With
the exception of 1985-86 (when, in any case, actual survey data exists only for a tiny handful
of countries), this has been the case in every period in the data. Having risen over the past

twenty years, the age gradient in opinion on relative economic issues is now almost as large
as for immigration, but in the opposite direction.9
Millennials and their younger counterparts today would therefore be better described as
relatively libertarian rather than socialist. They are more socially liberal, but more opposed
to government taxation and spending than older generations. This highlights the value of
moving beyond uni-dimensional left-right concepts when examining age cleavages.

Cross-National Patterns
Variation across countries is shown in Figure 2, which plots age differences between the
youngest and oldest groups for each ideological dimension in each country in both 1989-90
and 2015-16 (1989-90 being the first period when all four scales are available), and also shows
uncertainty. Positive numbers indicate that the old are more conservative than the young;
negative numbers, that the young are more conservative than the old.
For immigration and especially for social issues, there is little substantial cross-country
variation in either the size or direction of age differences. In both domains, the elderly were
more conservative than the young in virtually all twenty-seven countries in both periods,
with the only exceptions being a handful of countries in 1989-90 where the young were more
conservative than the old on immigration. These age differences were almost all statistically
different from zero at the 5% significance level. There is more cross-country variation in how
these differences have evolved over time. For social issues, the young and old have become
9. However, most previous work on age differences for tax and spending makes issue-specific predictions.
For instance, age differences may be much larger for pensions spending than in other policy areas. This
possibility is investigated in detail in the Supplementary Information. I show that if we disaggregate relative
economic conservatism by spending item, there are only small differences in the intensity of preferences for
higher pensions spending, which is very popular across all age groups. Age gaps are even smaller or nonexistent for health, education and welfare spending. Thus the aggregated picture from Figure 1 does not
conceal an impending gerontocracy regarding individual spending areas.

more similar since the 1980s almost universally in northern and central European countries,
but less so amongst countries in eastern and southern Europe. A few places such as Cyprus,
Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia show evidence of moderate increases in age gaps. There is
no consistent pattern of change over time in age differences on immigration. However, the
handful of countries where the young were once more anti-immigration than the old (Estonia,
Lithuania, Portugal and Slovenia) have all shifted over time to the more common pattern of
the old being more opposed. To further explore regional differences for a wider range of age
groups, the Supplementary Information repeats Figure 1 separately for eastern, southern,
and northern/central European countries. It shows patterns that are in line with Figure 2.
For absolute economic issues, most countries exhibit age differences that are small and
statistically indistinguishable from zero in 2015-16, which have also narrowed over time. In
just a few countries, notably Germany, Great Britain, Italy, Norway Portugal and Sweden,
the old were more economically conservative in absolute terms in 2015-16. Age gaps have
narrowed most notably in countries from the USSR or Eastern Bloc. Bulgaria, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, and Lithuania all used to have young people who were more conservative
than the old, but today the two age groups are virtually indistinguishable. For relative
economic issues there has been a near-universal shift over time to the young being more
opposed to government spending and taxation than the old, although differences remain
close to zero in several large countries such as France, Germany and Great Britain. There
are no countries in 2015-16 where the old are statistically significantly more conservative
than the young on tax and spending.
Figure 3 places countries in a 2-D space depicting mean age differences for social issues
and relative economic issues in the most recent period. Almost everywhere, it would be accurate to describe the young today as somewhat more libertarian. Disaggregating by countries
therefore does not substantially alter the conclusions drawn from Figure 1. Eastern European countries show the largest age gaps on both dimensions. Most Western and Southern
European countries are characterised by large age divides over social issues but smaller dis-

16

agreements on relative economic issues. The next section argues that the larger age gaps
for social issues in eastern Europe are consistent with these countries’ lower relative GDP.
They have begun a cohort-driven turn towards post-material values later than in northern
Europe. Larger age gaps in the East for relative economic issues could be connected to the
legacy of Communism. Today’s young Eastern Europeans, socialised in an era of smaller
government, think very differently about government spending compared to older citizens.

4. Age and Ideology: Age, Cohort or Period Effects?
This section explains why these age differences exist and why they have evolved over time,
focusing on age, period or cohort effects. Age effects imply that age differences are a result
of ageing itself; period effects, that all age groups are affected similarly by something in the
political environment that causes them to change their views; cohort effects, that generational
cohorts are socialised distinctively and maintain their distinctive views throughout their lives.
Ideological differences between age groups that look like an effect of ageing could simply
be due to persistent cohort differences. The distinction between age and cohort effects is
therefore crucial in determining how age differences are likely to evolve. If conservatism
rises naturally with age, then age cleavages could continue indefinitely into the future; if age
differences are a generational phenomenon, cleavages could be only temporary.

Theoretical Possibilities: Social Issues and Immigration
First, I focus on social issues and immigration, since they have very similar patterns over
time: an overall liberalisation of opinion combined with persistent age differences in ideology
(Figure 1). In theory there could be two explanations for these patterns:
1. There have been period affects combined with age effects. The whole of society has
liberalised over time. Simultaneously the old are more conservative at any given time
because people become more conservative as they age. There is persistent variance
across age groups, no matter what happens to the mean. In this scenario, conflict
between age groups could continue indefinitely because increasing conservatism is a
natural outcome of the ageing process.
2. There have been period effects combined with cohort effects. Persistent differences
exist between cohorts precisely because there have also been strong period effects.
As newer cohorts have been socialised in an increasingly liberal environment, they
have entered their political lives more liberal than their older counterparts. These
18

inter-cohort differences have persisted even as cohorts themselves have become more
progressive. In this scenario, age conflict would fall in future if more recent cohorts are
similarly liberal to each other, but more distinctive compared to older cohorts.
The second scenario appears more likely. It accords better with theory, as outlined in Section
1. Empirically, it is also difficult to square the first scenario with the decreasing age gaps
evident for the youngest four age groups on social issues in Figure 1. If age differences
are a natural feature of ageing, why would they be lower now than in the 1980s? But
if cohort replacement in a very liberal environment is behind the general patterns, age
gaps should decline if newer cohorts begin life more similarly liberal to each other. Crosscountry empirical evidence is also consistent with scenario 2, and in particular with the silent
revolution hypothesis (Inglehart 1990; Norris and Inglehart 2019), and work on east-west
differences (Walczak, Van der Brug, and de Vries 2012). They predict that it cohort-led
change should happen first in wealthier countries, where the young are socialised in an
environment where concerns about material security are given an increasingly lower priority
than post-material concerns for personal autonomy and quality of life. As shown in Figures
2 and 3, age differences for social issues and immigration remain highest in eastern and
southern European countries, with lower GDP per capita. The Supplementary Information
also shows that the narrowing of age gaps on social issues between the young and middleaged has happened most in wealthier northern Europe, where the same thing is starting to
happen for immigration, unlike in eastern and southern Europe.

Methods and Findings: Social Issues and Immigration
Typical approaches to age-period-cohort analysis use individual-level survey data to tease
apart the three mechanisms using various regression approaches with ages, periods and cohorts as independent variables, combined with modelling assumptions that break the perfect
collinearity between the three.10 Such approaches are not possible here, with aggregate-level
10. It arises because for any individual, age in years = period (the survey year) minus year of birth

19

data only. Instead I now introduce a simpler way of testing for these mechanisms, making
use of the fact that the data are divided into equal groups of ten years each. We can observe
random samples from the same cohorts, ten years apart. Because we observe cohorts on
repeated occasions when they are of different ages, I can decompose total changes in ideology into the effects of cohort replacement and within-cohort change. If members of the
same cohort hold the exact same views over time, then any aggregate change must be due
to cohort replacement alone. On the other hand, if cohorts change their views over time at
the exact same rate as aggregate change, then aggregate change should be due to changes
occurring to cohort members over time (Firebaugh 1997). It is important to note, however,
that this does not allow me to distinguish age effects from period effects as explanations
of within-cohort change, although below I use some theoretical arguments to discuss which
mechanism is more plausible.11
Specifically, I use two methods to examine the balance between inter- and intra-cohort
change, one informal and the other a little more formal. Both are outlined in detail by
Firebaugh (1997). First, I array changes over time in a table that displays intra-cohort
changes alongside total changes. Table 1 shows the table for social issues, for the periods
1985-6, 1995-6, 2005-6 and 2015-16, for all European countries together. These are simply
the numbers that underlie Figure 1. The model estimates of ideologies pertain only to age
groups: 18-27, 28-37, 38-47, 48-57, 58-67 and 68-77. But by looking at the data ten years
11. This also assumes no differential mortality between left-wingers and right-wingers within cohorts, so
that random samples of the same populations are being compared over time (Rodriguez 2018). This would
be unimportant if life expectancy is unrelated to ideology, but it is possible that a relationship does exist.
Wealth (and therefore life expectancy) may be somewhat positively related to economic conservatism and
negatively related to social conservatism. In the cases of both social issues and immigration, therefore, it
is possible that the tests in this paper slightly over-state the contribution from within-cohort change and
under-state the contribution from cohort replacement. A given cohort may appear to have liberalised over
time slightly more than in reality because social conservatives die faster than the social liberals.

apart, we definitively observe the same cohort on multiple occasions. For example, those
aged 18-27 in 1985-6 will be 38-47 in 2005-6.12 Within any one column, the top row are
aged 68-77, down to 18-27 in the bottom row. Reading across the rows, we can see change
within the cohorts. The bottom right cell of the table shows total ideological change over
the thirty-year period: the difference between mean ideology in 2015-6 and 1985-6.
Recalling that negative numbers mean less conservatism, an overall liberalisation of 0.99
is observed.13 For ease of visualisation, the rows from Table 1 that have more than one ob12. Strictly speaking, there could be some very slight overlap at the edges of these groups due to the use of

servation are also displayed graphically in Figure 4, demonstrating how each cohort evolved.
Some intra-cohort change is clear within all cohorts. The greatest change occurred amongst
the 1958-67 cohort, who liberalised by 0.51 over the whole period. On the other hand, diagonal comparisons in Table 1 from the upper left allow us to compare different cohorts at the
same ages. There is evidence of substantial cohort replacement effects, too. For instance,
we can see that the 1958-67 generation was far more conservative at the age of 18-27 (-0.08)
than the 1988-97 cohort were at the same age (-0.94). Figure 4 also confirms that the cohorts
tended to maintain their distinctiveness over time, with each new cohort more socially liberal
than its predecessor.
Within-cohort change did not keep pace with overall change. The three generations for
data comes from Eurostat

22

which we have complete data liberalised by at most half of the total change for Europe
over the period. Younger cohorts are also becoming increasingly homogenous. As one
metric, consider the fact that the ideological gap between the youngest cohort and the
third-oldest cohort was 0.35 in 2015-16, compared to 0.46 in 2005-6, 0.58 in 1995-6 and 0.74
in 1985-6. This helps account for the fact that, as shown in Figure 1, the gap in social
conservatism between middle-aged and young people has fallen particularly markedly in
recent years. There is some evidence of polarisation of within-cohort effects in the most
recent period, with younger cohorts continuing to liberalise while older cohorts became
slightly more conservative. This is consistent with the cultural backlash theory of Norris
and Inglehart (2019): older cohorts may be turning against the ‘silent revolution’ even as
post-materialism continues to push younger cohorts towards greater liberalism.

Table 2 does the same exercise for immigration for the period of 1989-90 to 2009-10,
because the immigration data do not start until 1989-90. The same comparisons in the table,
diagonally and laterally, show that within-cohort changes account for very little of the overall
change. Again, the cohort changes (rows) are also displayed graphically in the left-hand panel
of Figure 5. In fact earlier cohorts actually became slightly more conservative, and like for
social issues, there is some evidence of increasing within-cohort effects for younger cohorts.
This heterogeneity by cohort is again consistent with a backlash against an increasingly
socially liberal consensus. Cohort replacement was therefore much more important. Again,
as an example we can see that the 1962-72 generation was far more conservative at the age
of 18-27 (-0.06) than the 1982-92 cohort were at the same age (-0.49).

Thus cohort effects are important for both social issues and immigration, but exactly how
24

important they are is not yet clear. Now, I introduce a second more formal decomposition of
total ideological change into within-cohort and between-cohort components. This uses the
fact that a difference in the weighted means of two columns, such as the difference of -0.99 in
Table 1, must be equal to a weighted average of change within their constituent rows. This
result is originally due to Kitagawa (1955), was further developed by Das Gupta (1978) and
is outlined in detail in Firebaugh (1997).
Logically, if the population-weighted ideologies in Table 1 changed by -0.99, some of that
must be due to the departure of the first three cohorts and the arrival of the final three, some
must be due to changes within the middle three cohorts (for whom we have complete data),
and some must be due to changes in the weights (i.e., the population shares). Incorporating
all three of those effects, the total change between two periods can be decomposed as:

"

∆µ =

X
j

X µj1 + µj2
ρj1 + ρj2
∆µj +
∆ρj
2
2
j
#

"

#

where 1 and 2 refer to the start and end time periods, j refers to cohorts, µjt refers to
ideological positions and ρjt refers to population shares. The first term calculates total
inter-cohort change, weighted by each cohort’s average population share. The second term
calculates total change resulting from cohort replacement, weighted by each cohort’s average
ideological position over time.
This is shown in Figure 6, decomposing change from 1985/6-2015/16 in the case of social
issues, and 1989/90-2009/10 in the case of immigration. Most of the current age gaps in
opinions for social issues and immigration can be accounted for by persistent cohort differences. For immigration, both effects exist but cohort replacement is much more important.
For social issues, cohort replacement completely dominates. Only a small amount of change
occurred within age cohorts for social issues. However, Figures 4 and 5 suggested that these
within-cohort effects are currently increasing, so that within-cohort change could become

more prominent in future, especially as cohort differences are falling for younger cohorts.
It is not possible to say definitively whether within-cohort changes reflect period or age
effects. The two are observationally equivalent. However, period effects are the more likely
explanation. If the cause was ageing effects, then there is no reason why within-cohort
changes should be larger now than they were in the past. Such a pattern is, however,
perfectly consistent with period effects. This is reinforced by the lower within-cohort change
for immigration, where there have arguably been fewer societal trends over the period pushing
toward greater liberalisation. If, on the other hand, people naturally become more liberal as
they age, then that should have occurred equally for immigration as for social issues.
The direction and heterogeneity of the effects are also important. For social issues, withincohort effects mostly caused greater liberalisation, not conservatism, but some increases in
conservatism are visible amongst older cohorts more recently. Figure 4 also shows that

26

within-cohort effects have changed over time. The 1918-27 and 1928-37 cohorts became more
liberal in their 60s and 70s (from 1985-6 to 1995-6), yet the 1938-47 and 1948-57 cohorts
became more conservative at the same ages. Indeed, with the exception of the latest period,
Figure 4 suggests that cohorts tend to change mostly in parallel, maintaining their distinctive
levels of conservatism over time. For immigration, meanwhile, within-cohort effects caused
greater conservatism amongst the oldest cohorts but greater liberalism amongst others.
There are no existing theories of ageing predicting that people should become more
socially liberal as they age, or that argue for heterogenous age effects across cohorts. They
instead predict greater conservatism as a natural feature of the ageing process. It is most
likely that increases in social liberalism occurred due to period effects that impacted on all
cohorts at once, or at the very least that negative period effects substantially outpaced any
positive age effects. Recent increases in conservatism amongst some older cohorts may reflect
a backlash against the new socially liberal consensus in Europe.
Thus while the data certainly do not allow for unequivocal conclusions, the balance of
evidence points to the second of the two theories that I began this Section with. This is
important for the evolution of age differences in ideologies over time. At least for social
issues, as period effects slow down or even disappear, so too will cohort effects, as cohorts
become increasingly similarly liberal to each other. Large age differences may be far from a
permanent feature of European politics. Based on the current evidence, they are likely to
wane over time. For immigration, the persistence of age differences will depend on whether
new cohorts continue to be more pro-immigration than their forebears or whether eventually,
a mechanism similar to that for social issues kicks in.

Relative Economic Issues
Figure 1 showed that the young have become increasingly conservative on relative economic
issues since the 1990s. From the late 1980s to the new millenium, all age groups exhibited
small rises in opposition to tax and spending, whereas from 200 up to 2010 all age groups

became more supportive. The latter trend was accelerated during the financial crisis from
2007, but began before it. Then, from 2010 onwards there was a partial rebounding of
opinion in a conservative direction. To help understand these patterns, Table 3 shows the
same results as Table 2 for relative economic issues from 1989-90 to 2009-10.14 Again, cohort
patterns are also displayed graphically in the right-hand panel of Figure 5.
There was an overall liberalisation of opinion of -0.66. In contrast to social issues and
immigration, there were very large within-cohort changes, whose direction also fluctuated
over time, but much more modest differences between cohorts. In line with the aggregate
patterns in Figure 1, almost all cohorts became somewhat more conservative on this dimen14. Although technically the data for relative economic issues do begin in 1985-86, only a tiny handful of
countries feature before 1989

28

sion from 1989-90 to 1999-00, and then became much more liberal during the 2000s. This
marked difference between the 1990s and 2000s meant that the 1972-82 cohort began their
political life more conservative than the 1962-72 cohort was when aged 18-27 (0.53 vs. 0.37),
but the 1982-92 cohort was much more left-wing at the same age (0.01).
These patterns are again highly consistent with period effects, but not with age effects.
Cohorts virtually all moved in parallel in both decades shown in Figure 5, and the direction
of change was different in each decade. For instance, the 1962-72 cohort became more
conservative as they aged from 18-27 to 28-37 (0.37 to 0.57) whereas the 1972-82 cohort
became much more leftwing as their ages changed in exactly the same way (0.53 to -0.11,
from 1990-2000 to 2009-10). This is surely due to the very different economic circumstances
and government policies in place during those periods. Clearly, over the same period (19902000 to 2009-10), the 1962-72 cohort also became more left-wing (0.57 to -0.24), just like
the cohort below them. Age effects, on the other hand, should be unidirectional over time
because they are theorised to be inherent to the ageing process.
The same formal decomposition method shown in Figure 6 found that within-cohort
changes account for 98% of the overall change from 1989-90 to 2009-10. This is due to the very
large period effects that occurred for all cohorts during the financial crisis, as demonstrated
by Figure 5. There are nonetheless also some signs of cohort effects, since younger cohorts
have remained a little more conservative on this dimension over time than older cohorts.
Figure 5 suggests that increasing age gaps for relative economic issues actually have their
roots in the pre-crisis period, when younger cohorts were socialised in an environment of
relative affluence, becoming more conservative over the decade, unlike older cohorts. Overall,
period effects for relative economic ideology have a higher variance than they do for social
issues and immigration. Changes in government spending, taxation and debt levels as well
as economic booms and busts occur more often and more rapidly than the kinds of social
change that influence social conservatism. There is very little evidence that there are age
effects in determining economic ideologies, with period effects being much more important.

29

5. Conclusion
This paper has carried out a comprehensive, long-term examination of age differences in
ideologies in Europe since the 1980s. In contrast to prevailing narratives in the media, there
is not a lot of evidence that conservatism rises naturally with age, nor is it true that the
young and old are becoming increasingly ideologically opposed and the young are becoming
more socialist. The findings support theories of cohort-based change, and also show that
age divides are much more important for non-economic issues than over public spending,
including pensions and education. Today’s age divides over social issues and immigration
are similar in size to the 1980s and are starting to fall. In most places the young are now more
opposed to taxation and government spending than the elderly. Ideological divisions between
age groups are also likely to continue falling rather than rising in the future, especially in the
wealthier democracies of central and northern Europe, due to a slowdown in cohort effects.
There, the rise of post-material values has been ongoing for decades, and is increasingly
leading to consensus across age groups. The young and middle-aged today increasingly
share a socially liberal outlook, being comfortable with gender equality, LGBT rights and
strong action to fight climate change, leading to declining ideological differences between age
groups. As today’s middle-aged become tomorrow’s elderly, age groups are likely to become
more homogenous in their ideological beliefs on non-economic issues. In eastern Europe and
some southern European countries, the silent revolution is at something of an earlier stage,
meaning that age divisions are likely to persist for longer in those countries.
Those who fear that Europe is degenerating into a gerontocracy, or that a bitter age
divide is going to replace class or religion as Europe’s main political cleavage, probably
do not need to worry. Why, then, have age gaps in voting widened in recent years in
certain places, notably Spain and the UK? A likely explanation is that the emergence of new
parties with more extreme positions – at both ends of the spectrum – on social issues and
immigration over the past thirty years has allowed the young and old to better express their
long-standing and distinctive non-economic preferences in their votes. This also fits with
30

what we know about youth and voting behaviour in Europe today. Structural factors like
class, religion and economic ideology that used to be important determinants of vote choices
are less important for young people compared to previous generations (Van der Brug 2010).
Non-economic issues such as immigration have a greater effect on their voting compared to
the old (Walczak, Van der Brug, and de Vries 2012).
This paper’s results were enabled by new multi-dimensional measures of citizens’ ideologies, and demonstrate the value of looking across issue areas. A lot of past literature has
focused intensely on age divides in attitudes toward the welfare state, especially on education
and pensions spending, where self-interest could in theory lead to large age divisions. I have
shown that such divisions are generally smaller than for social issues. As political conflict in
Europe increasingly takes place over non-economic issues, any major age divides in future
are likely to occur in those areas rather than over the welfare state. Despite the richness
of the available data, this paper nonetheless leaves room for further research. As more and
more cross-national survey data become available in the coming years, it will be possible to
track existing cohorts for longer with the same methodology as this study, offering greater
clues to the persistence and direction of cohort and period effects.

2. Specific Spending Preferences
As discussed in the main text, the scale for relative economic issues arguably provides an incomplete
test of the possibility of an age war. Age gaps are smaller than for social issues, consistent with
past literature. Nonetheless, most previous work on age differences for tax and spending makes
issue-specific rather than general predictions. For instance, age differences may be much larger for
pensions spending than in other policy areas. Figure 1 investigates this possibility using survey
questions from the ISSP Role of Government Surveys, which were also included in the relative
economic issue scale shown above. These surveys have asked voters across Europe for their views on
whether government spending should rise for particular policies on five occasions: 1985, 1990, 1996,
2006 and 2016. Some countries feature for all time periods while others appear more occasionally.
The figure shows the difference in mean spending preferences between the old and the young by
country, with positive values indicating that the old are keener on higher spending than the young.
Response scales for all questions have five points from ‘much lower’ to ‘much higher.’ The old are
defined as aged 65+ and the young as aged 30 and under.1
For health, education and unemployment benefits, age differences are in general small and often
statistically indistinguishable from zero. This is particularly the case for health, where most point
estimates are centered very close to zero, despite the elderly using more healthcare on average
than the young. The evidence for education points to a modest age gap in the expected direction,
although the differences are generally very small. The mean cross-country age gap of 0.101 for the
countries shown in the figure corresponds to one eighth of a standard deviation of the question’s
response scale. In fact, baseline support for greater education spending is very high across both
age groups. The only difference is in intensity, with the young slightly more likely to want ‘much
higher’ spending. In 2016 42.9% and 28.8% of those aged 30 and under wanted ‘higher’ and ‘much
higher’ education spending, compared to 44.9% and 21.8% of those aged 65 and over. Even in
France where the 2016 gap is highest, a majority (53%) of the elderly supported higher or much
higher spending, compared to 65% of the young.
For unemployment benefits, age differences are again modest in most places. There was a
notable shift from 2006 to 2016, with the old becoming more sympathetic than the young towards
spending on unemployment benefits, in line with the overall picture in Figure ??. Finally, for
spending on pensions the average age difference is larger, with the old more likely to want higher
spending. In some countries these divides appear to be decreasing, notably in Finland, Germany
and Great Britain, but elsewhere this is not the case, or we lack 2016 data. Again though, virtually
nobody – young or old – wanted lower spending: 4.4% of the young and 1.3% of the old in 2016.
Majorities of both age groups again favored higher spending, with 44.8% and 18.1% of the young
wanting it higher and much higher compared to 41.4% and 31.4% of the old. Age differences in
preferences for ‘much higher’ pensions spending are therefore large, but otherwise there is quite
substantial agreement. Pensions spending remains a popular spending item across age groups.

Figure 1: Differences in mean preference between old and young for higher government
spending in four policy areas, and associated 95% confidence intervals [positive = old
people prefer higher spending than young people]

It is arguably important to distinguish between areas where the young and old have preferences
for completely different policies versus areas where they want the same things, but with differing
degrees of intensity. Education and pensions spending, classic valence items, clearly fall into the
latter camp. Once we disaggregate relative economic conservatism by spending item, there are
differences in the intensity of preferences for higher pensions spending, but little evidence of an
enormous age war or an impending gerontocracy.
