Abstract
Purpose: To compare parent and child reports on their relationship and communication about sex; quantify
agreement; and find characteristics associated with higher agreement.
Methods: Data is baseline data from an evaluation of Talking Parents, Healthy Teens, a multi-session
worksite-based parenting program. Participants are 569 parents of 6–10th grades who responded to an
advertisement posted in their workplace, and their 6-10th grade children (n=683): 683 parent-child dyads.
Self-administered survey data were collected in Southern California from 2002-2004. We compare parent
and child responses to 68 items about their relationships and communication about sex, and computed
polychoric correlation (PCC), an agreement measure that corrects for possible parent-child differences in
response threshholds, across dyads and across items. Factors associated with higher agreement were found
through bivariate comparison of PCC; linear regression on intra-dyad PCC; and linear regression on raw
bias.
Results: After adjusting for possible parent-child differences in response threshholds, PCC for items
were low, with median 0.34 (inter-quartile range (IQR) (0.22, 0.41)). Agreement was higher for sexual discussion topics (median 0.41 (IQR (0.37, 0.46))) than other items (Wilcoxon p¡0.001); in general, agreement
was higher for factual than emotionally negative or hypothetical items. PCC for dyads was very high, with
median 0.87 (IQR (0.84, 0.91)), but left-skewed (skewness = -3.1). Factors associated with greater parentchild agreement include younger child age, better parenting skills, parent married or living as married, and
1

parent recollection of good communication with their own parents. Agreement was not associated with
socioeconomic factors.
Conclusions: Survey-response discordance appears not to be solely attrbutable to response bias. Items
about concrete events yield better agreement than hypothetical items. Response discordance may be partially attributable to different parent and child perceptions of their relationship because less discordance
is evidence among parents with good parenting skills or who recall good communication with their own
parents.

Introduction
Many states’ sex education policies are formulated to make parents their adolescents’ primary sex educators:
32 states do not include contraception in sex education (1), and since 1996 the federal government has given
states $50 million per year for sex education that may not teach contraceptive effectiveness (2). Policies
to exclude contraception were formulated with the premise that the decision of whether and how to teach
contraception should be left to families, whereas teaching contraceptives in schools encourages adolescents
to have sex (3). These curriculum choices seem to impact adolescents: fewer adolescents reported learning
about contraception in school in 2002 than 1995 (4). Parents seem not to have filled in the gaps in school
sex education: fewer adolescents report having discussed sexually transmitted infections and contraception
with their parents in 2002 than in 1995 (5). This study quantifies the effectiveness of parent-initiated sex
education by measuring agreement between parent and adolescent reports, identifies barriers to parents’
teaching their adolescents about contraception, and identifies ways that clinicians may bridge that gap.
Parent-adolescent communication, in general and about sex, may influence adolescents’ sexual decisions. Adolescents who have close relationships and more open communication with their parents are more
likely to delay sexual activity or have safer sex (6–12), learn more about sex from their parents (13), and
have attitudes about sex similar to those of their parents (14). Adolescents say that they prefer to learn about
sex from their parents (15), and adolescents who learn about sex and sexual values from parents are less
likely to be sexually active (10, 16–19). Adolescents who correctly perceive that their mothers disapprove
of premarital sex are more likely to abstain or delay sexual involvement (9, 19, 20), but some adolescents
underestimate their parents’ disapproval of premarital sex (9, 19, 21). Sexually active, older adolescents who
communicate with their parents about sex are more likely to have safer sex (18, 22–24) and communicate
2

with sexual partners (23, 25, 26).
Parents can be successful sex educators (6, 9, 11, 27, 28), but some parents may over-report their communication about sex. Parents report more discussion about sex than do adolescents (16, 18, 19, 21, 29, 30).
Parents’ and adolescents’ reports about their conversations such as the topics covered are poorly correlated
(13, 19, 21), which is important because only parent-initiated sex education that is also reported by adolescents is associated with delayed sex; if the parent reports the sex education but the adolescent does not, it is
not associated with delay (21). This lack of agreement may indicate lack of effective communication, that
parents’ intended messages were not received by adolescents, as suggested by qualitative research findings
that parents may report that they discussed a certain topic with their adolescent even where very few words
were actually exchanged about the topic (31). Parents also underestimate older adolescents’ sexual activity
(19, 32–34).
This study looks at the effectiveness of parent-initiated sex education efforts by comparing parents’ and
adolescents’ reports of relationship and the quality and extent of communication about sex, the accuracy
of adolescents’ assessments of their parents’ approval of their having sex and using condoms, and parents’
assessments of whether their adolescents are sexually active. This study is unique for including a more
extensive set of 72 measures than past literature. U.S. sex education policy has been formulated out of
concern that schools teaching contraception would be misinterpreted by students as implying adult approval
of premarital sex (3). Qualitative research suggests that parents are concerned with misinterpretation (35),
but parents’ fear of misinterpretation has not been studied extensively in quantitative studies. This study is
unique for focusing on parents’ and adolescents’ concerns about misinterpretation: parents’ concerns that
teaching contraception could be misinterpreted as approval to have sex and adolescents’ concerns that asking
questions could imply that they are currently having sex.

Methods
Data
This study uses baseline data from an evaluation of Talking Parents, Healthy Teens, a multi-session workplacebased parenting program that enrolled 569 parents employed by 13 large employers in Southern California
(36–38). Eligible parents had at least one adolescent in grades 6–10, and volunteered to be randomized to
the parenting program or a control arm. All age-eligible adolescent children of the participants were permit3

ted to participate; a total of 683 did so, resulting in 683 parent-adolescent dyads, which are the primary unit
of analysis. Parents enrolled in the study, and 96.2% of their 6–10th grade adolescent children agreed to
participate. Parents and adolescents answered pen and paper surveys separately: parents at the workplace,
and adolescents via mailed-in surveys. Only the parent who was sampled in the workplace completed the
surveys; similarly, the adolescent described their relationship and communication with only the one participating parent. This study uses data collected prior to the intervention from both program and control
groups.
Parents completed a general survey about themselves and one survey for each of their adolescents. Each
adolescent completed one survey. All respondents were assured that their answers would not be revealed
to others in their family. Refusal to answer, giving more than one response, illegible responses, or “don’t
know” were coded as missing. Missing data was singly imputed using SAS PROC MI, Version X. Sample
characteristics are in electronic Table 1. Within each dyad, a Fisher’s exact test was performed to determine
whether parent and adolescent skips are independent, and the number of dyads where the null hypothesis
was rejected by the exact test was evaluated with a binomial test (n=710, p=0.05), implying that parents and
adolescents within the same pair may have both skipped some of the same questions.

Variables
The analysis used 72 survey items in 5 domains: relationship and communication (20 items), monitoring (8
items), conflict (9 items), quality of communication about sex (13 items), and sexual topics discussed (22
items) (Tables 1 and 2). Items about relationship and communication and communication about sex used a
4, 5, or 7 category Likert scale. Scales were normalized to the unit interval and reversed where necessary,
so that higher scores indicate more positive outcomes. Some items asked parents and adolescents to assess
the other’s opinion, and other items asked respondents for their own opinion. Sexual discussion topic items
asked respondents to report whether or not they discussed the topic with their parent/adolescent. Parents
indicated their approval of their adolescent having premarital vaginal sex and using condoms. Adolescents
age 13 and over (n=354) assessed their parents’ views, and their assessments were assessed for accuracy.
All adolescents were asked whether they have had vaginal intercourse and oral-genital contact; 3 adolescents who report either male-on-female or female-on-male oral-genital contact are coded as having had oral
sex. Parents assessed adolescents’ histories of vaginal and oral intercourse, and parents’ assessments were
4

compared with adolescents’ reports to judge the accuracy.

Analysis
We compare the medians of ordinal items and the number of sexual topics discussed using Wilcoxon test, and
compare dichotomous items using the exact McNemar test, both at the 0.05 level. The difference between
two groups can be statistically significant without being practically significant, so to judge how substantial
the differences are and compare questions, we compute Cohen’s measure of effect size, classified as large
(more than 0.8), medium (0.5–0.8), small (0.2–0.5), and insubstantial (0.0–0.2) (39). Cohen’s effect size
is the absolute value of the difference between means divided by the average of standard deviations, and it
can be greater than 1. We discuss all questions with effect size larger than 0.5, and questions with similar
themes.
Parent-adolescent agreement is measured by polychoric correlation (PCC), which evaluates whether parents and adolescents answer questions about the same underlying construct, assuming that discrete responses
are based on an underlying normally-distributed continuous variable (40–45). PCC corrects for the attenuation in correlations due to discretization of response options, and is an agreement measure independent of
prevalence, in contrast to the conventionally used kappa, and can be interpreted like the usual correlation, in
which 0 is chance agreement and 1 is perfect agreement. PCC is estimated using the two-step estimator in
the R polycor package (46). PCC is summarized in quintiles: very low agreement (0.0–0.2), low (0.2–0.4),
moderate (0.4–0.6), high (0.6–0.8), and very high (0.8–1.0) because in this data, the 95% confidence interval widths for PCC are about 0.2. Very low PCC corresponds to near-chance agreement, and is consistent
with parents and adolescents giving responses completely independently of the other. We focus on items
with low agreement and high median differences, as this implies large parent-adolescent differences, both as
groups and pairs. We assess adolescents’ perception of their parents’ views, by computing the proportion of
adolescents who perceive that the parent disapproves or strongly disapproves, conditional on their parent’s
actual response to each of 4 actions: sex now, in high school, and over age 18, and using condoms if they do
have sex. The predictiveness of the adolescent’s response is assessed with a two-way analysis of variance
of the parent view by the hypothetical action and the adolescent’s assessment. We assess parent assessment
of adolescent sexual activity with similar computation of conditional probabilities and analysis of variance.
Factors associated with correct assessment of adolescents’ sexual activity were not investigated because of
5

the low power, due to low rates of sexual activity in this population (12 of 42 successful assessments of
vaginal sex, 13 of 66 of oral sex).

Results
Relationship
Parents and adolescents rated general aspects of their relationship highly and their responses corresponded
closely for items such as feeling close, overall relationship, whether the parent is warm and loving, and
overall communication (Table 1). Parents underestimated how cared for adolescents feel and how satisfied
adolescents are with their communication. Adolescents gave more negative assessments in other relationship
domains, such as whether the parent tried to understand the adolescent, which was the largest difference
between parents and adolescents (medium Cohen effect size 0.66) and had low agreement (PCC 0.21).
Adolescents also rated more negatively specific aspects of communication, such as whether they talked
together the past week, whether they get a chance to speak, and whether the parent praises the adolescent.
Adolescents reported that their parents know fewer of their telephone callers than the parents did, and
in general they perceived less monitoring than the parents reported giving, concurring with adolescents’
being less likely than their parent to report that their parents might read their diary or listen to phone calls.
Adolescents also perceived more conflict with their parents, and parents’ and adolescents’ ratings about
conflict have low agreement even where the absolute difference has insignificant effect size.

Communication about sex
Adolescents are more likely than their parents to report that they already know everything that they need to
know about sex, and this question had the largest effect size of all questions (Table 2). Adolescents gave
more negative reports whether their parent tries to understand their questions about sex, similar to the general
relationship question about whether the parent tries to understand the adolescent in general: both questions
had medium to large effect sizes (0.66 and 0.67) and low agreement (PCC=0.21 for both). For same-sex
crushes and homosexuality, substantially more parents reported that they taught about homosexuality than
adolescents recalled (81% vs. 54%, effect size 0.59), and parents were more likely to report that their
adolescent would tell them about a same sex crush than adolescents reported, which had medium effect size
and low agreement (effect size 0.53, and PCC=0.12).
6

Parents and adolescents differed in two areas of potential misunderstanding: parents were more likely to
report that teaching their adolescent about condoms may be misunderstood as permission to have sex which
also had low agreement (effect size 0.55, PCC=0.05), and adolescents were more likely to report that if they
asked about sex, their parent would assume that they were having sex, which also had low agreement (effect
size 0.47 and PCC=0.12).
Parents reported having discussed more sexual topics than their adolescents. Four topics were reported
by a majority of both adolescents and parents: pregnancy, consequences of pregnancy, homosexuality, and
choosing friends. Another 4 topics were reported by 40–50% of adolescents and a majority of parents: menstruation, male and female sexual development, and that the adolescent should not have sex. Adolescents
were less likely than parents to report having discussed all 8 of these more frequently discussed topics, as
well as 5 less frequently discussed topics. More adolescents than parents reported having discussed not
pressuring for sex, saying no to sex, negotiating condom use, and STI symptoms. For many topics, parents
and adolescents did not differ much in whether they reported having discussed the topics, but these topics
were discussed rarely. Less than 10% of parents report having taught their adolescents how to use a condom
or how to negotiate condom use, and only 11% of parents report having taught their adolescents how to
choose birth control.

Adolescents’ perceptions of parents’ attitudes about premarital sex and condom use
Nearly all adolescents report that their parent disapproves of sex both now and in high school. Even the
adolescents of parents who approve of sex now and in high school almost universally report that their
parents disapprove. Most adolescents whose parents disapprove of premarital sex after age 18 correctly
perceive their parents’ disapproval (Figure 1). Nearly all adolescents report that their parent approves of
condom use, and this perception matches their parents’ report.

Parents’ perceptions of adolescents’ sexual activity
Parent belief of whether their adolescent has had oral or vaginal sex is predictive of the adolescent’s actual
sexual experience (Figure 2, ANOVA p ¡ 10?16 for parent, p = 0.03 for act), but most parents of sexually
active adolescents did not know about their adolescents’ sexual activity.
Most parents’ beliefs about their adolescents’ sexual activity are correct. Parents who report that their
adolescents are definitely not sexually active are correct 95% of the time, and parents who report their
7

adolescents are probably not sexually active are correct 83% and 67% of the time, respectively for oral and
vaginal sex. Parents who report that their adolescents are probably or definitely sexually active are correct
respectively 68% and 60% of the time. Most parents (87%) report that their adolescent has definitely not
had oral sex, and 6% of their adolescents have had oral sex. Most parents (87%) report that their adolescent
has definitely not had vaginal sex, and 3.9% of their adolescents have had vaginal sex. Most sexually active
adolescents’ parents report that their adolescents are not sexually active: 80.3% of the 66 adolescents who
report having had oral sex and 71.4% of the 42 adolescents who report having had vaginal sex have parents
who report that their adolescent has probably not or definitely not engaged in these respective behaviors.

Discussion
For most parent-adolescent dyads in this sample, the parent-initiated sex education comprises only basic
“birds and the bees” topics, such as pregnancy and puberty. Even for these basic topics, fewer adolescents
than parents report having had these conversations, which parallels aspects of adolescents’ reports of their
overall relationship with their parents: adolescents report spending less time talking with their parents or
being praised than their parents do. The qualitative research suggests that the gap between parent and
adolescent reports may be attributable to parents saying that a conversation occurred when few words were
actually exchanged (31).
Few parents teach adolescents how to use and negotiate condoms. Previous studies found higher estimates of discussions of the generic topic of “condoms” (16, 30) but did not specify the content, such as use
or negotiation. Previous studies’ estimates are not likely to be comparable because the topic of condoms is
broader than the specific topics of condom use and condom negotiation.
Differences in parents’ and adolescents’ reports may identify barriers to parent-adolescent discussions
about sex. Clinicians may be able to bridge two gaps between parents’ and adolescents’ mutual fear of
misunderstanding. First, parents report concern that if they teach their adolescents about birth control, their
adolescents would interpret that as permission to have sex. Second, adolescents report concern that if they
asked their parents questions about sex, their parents would misinterpret their questions as implying that the
adolescents are having sex.
Parents’ concerns that teaching condom use would be misinterpreted by their adolescents as approval
of sex does not seem to be reflected by adolescents’ reports. Nearly all adolescents report that their parents
8

disapprove of sex both now and in high school, and some adolescents actually over-estimate their parents’
disapproval of sex, which differs from past studies in more sexually active populations that find that adolescents underestimate their parents’ disapproval (9, 19, 21). The data cannot reveal whether adolescents would
misperceive if their parents taught them about condoms, but the near-universal agreement of adolescents that
their parents disapprove of their having sex, even among adolescents of parents who approve, implies that
this perception is unlikely to change easily. Few parents in this sample disapprove of their adolescents eventually having premarital sex, so parents’ low rates of teaching about condoms and concerns about teaching
condom use as implying endorsement of their adolescents having sex now is unexpected. Less than 10%
of both adolescents and parents reported that the parents had taught their adolescents how to use condoms
and negotiate condom use, a similar quantity reported in a sample of church-going Southern Baptists who
disapprove of premarital sex (47); other studies find that conservative parents are even less likely to teach
condom use (48).
Adolescents’ concerns about being falsely perceived as having sex also do not seem to be founded.
Respectively, 92% and 95% of parents of sexually inactive adolescents correctly assess that their adolescents
have not had oral and vaginal sex. The data cannot reveal whether parents would misunderstand if their
adolescent asked more questions, but the high specificity of parents’ assessments of adolescents’ sexual
activity implies that adolescents’ concerns are implausible. Most parents who assessed that their adolescents
were sexually active were right, but most parents of sexually active adolescents were unaware of their
adolescents’ sexual activity. Correct assessment of adolescents’ sexual activity is important because parents
who assess that their adolescents may soon become sexually active can teach them about contraception and
successfully influence their safe sex decisions (19, 48–50).
Few parents reported having discussed specific methods to prevent STIs and pregnancy, and adolescents
agreed that these discussions were rare. One possible explanation for the rareness of discussions about
STI and pregnancy prevention are parents’ and adolescents’ fears about mutual misinterpretation of these
conversations.
Conforming to stereotype, adolescents were more likely than their parents to report that they already
know everything about sex and that they already know more than their parents about sex, but this belief
may be attributable to adolescents’ fear of being misunderstood. Adolescents say they feel loved but not
praised or understood by parents, and parents may over-estimate how much time they spend talking with
9

their adolescent and telling their adolescent what they appreciate. The low agreement and large differences
between parent and adolescent responses to these questions may imply that parents who neglect these areas
may be unaware of their adolescents’ dissatisfaction, while parents who are attentive to these areas may be
unaware of how well they are doing and how satisfied their adolescent is.
Homosexuality is a topic of particular misunderstanding: parents reported that they talk about homosexuality more and overestimate how likely their adolescent would be to tell them of a same-sex crush. Parents
may not raise the topic of homosexuality in a direct and comprehensible way to their adolescents, or perhaps
only a small fraction of the adolescents considers the topic of homosexuality to be germane to them and thus
did not recall conversations with their parents on the topic.
Discussions with parents about sex may not be a solution for everyone. Not all adolescents said that
they were very interested in learning about sex from their parents. The low rate of parents teaching their
adolescents about condoms may imply that federal and state sex education policy cannot rely on parents to
teach adolescents how to protect themselves from STIs and pregnancy.

Limitations
This study highlights areas where parents report more communication than their adolescents do, but it’s
not possible to know whether parents attempted to raise the subject but did so ineffectively, or whether
parents did not attempt communication. This study also does not reveal which methods parents can use to
raise topics so that communication is most likely to be effective. In some cases, agreement could be due
to ineffective memory rather than ineffective communication, but agreement between parent and adolescent
pairs is nonetheless a reasonable indicator of communication effectiveness.
This study uses a self-selected sample of parents working for large employers in Southern California
who are interested in improving their communication with their adolescent, and it does not generalize to all
adolescents.
Nearly all adolescents reported their parents disapprove of sex, but nonetheless a small fraction of adolescents have sex; past studies have found that perception of parent disapproval predicts delay but not abstinence (9, 19, 20).

10

Conclusions
Less than 10% of parents teach their adolescents how to use condoms. Even parents who do not disapprove
of premarital sex may limit their discussion of contraception to avoid being misinterpreted as giving their
adolescents permission to have premarital sex now. State sex education policy cannot rely on parents to
teach their adolescents about condoms; schools play a vital role.
Clinicians can be an invaluable bridge between parents and adolescents to avert potential misunderstandings. Clinicians can reassure both parents and adolescents that discussing contraception is not permission
for sex and adolescents’ questions about sex do not imply that they are sexually active. Future parent sex
education interventions can investigate ways to alleviate parents’ concerns of misinterpretation.

Communication items are on an ordinal scale normalized to a scale from 0 to 1, with 0 being more negative or low
rating, and 1 being positive or high. Discussion topics are dichotomous, and the mean represents the percent endorsing.
For communication items, p-value is from Wilcoxon rank
17 sum test; for topics, p-value is from the McNemar test.
Cohen’s effect size is absolute value of difference divided by average standard deviation: large effect size greater than
0.8, medium effect size 0.5–0.8, small 0.2–0.5, and insignificant below 0.2 and listed as “ns” if not significant. PCC is
polychoric correlation and is summarized in quintiles: chance agreement (0.0-0.2), low (0.2-0.4), moderate (0.4-0.6),
high (0.6-0.8), and very high (0.8-1.0). Moderate and above PCC is bolded. Chance agreement is listed as ns for not
significant.Items are sorted within category by effect size.
