Abstract. User data fuel the digital economy, while individual privacy
is at stake. Governments react differently to this challenge. Estonia, a
small Baltic state, has become a role model for the renewal of the social
contract in times of big data (hence, often ironically referred to as ”Estonia”). While e-governance usage has been growing in many parts of
Europe during the last ten years, some regions are lagging behind. The
Estonian example suggests that online governance is most accepted in a
small state, with a young population, trustworthy institutions and the
need of technological renewal. This work examines the development of
e-governance usage (citizens interacting digitally with the government)
during the last decade in Europe from a comprehensive cross-country
perspective: Size, age and trust are relevant for the usage of digital government services in Europe. However, the quality of past communication
infrastructure is not related to e-governance popularity.

Keywords: E-Governance, Europe, Estonia, Random Model, Trust.

Introduction

Personal data have become a valuable resource. In fact, many digital applications
and business solutions in the digital economy would not be imaginable without
the constant flow of user data. Users have become ”spinning wheels of data”1 .
The question of data protection has become immanent. Data-leaks, such as the
scandal about the exploitation of Facebook data by the research firm Cambridge
Analytica, question the security of our personal data. How to protect individual privacy, while not hindering the free flow of data in the digital economy?
Governments have reacted differently to this challenge, with questionable outcomes for democracy and individual freedoms. China is explicitly making use
of citizens’ personal data for the surveillance and control of its society. In the
US, private sector companies are the largest owners of citizen data. In contrast,
Estonia, a Baltic state with roughly 1.5 million inhabitants, delivers a positive

role model for the renewal of the social contract in times of big data. The Estonian model relies on transparency and accountability: Most user data are openly
available to government institutions, while citizens can follow up every single request of their data and have the right to demand clear justifications for its usage.

Fig. 1. In the EU, online interaction with between citizens and their governments has
been staidly rising over the past ten years. In Estonia and its Scandinavian neighbours,
almost all internet users regularly exchange information with their government online.

The Estonian model works well. Every citizen owns a digital identity and
electronic signature. Via the country’s decentralised data highway all public requests2 can be efficiently and securely processed with minimal administrative
burden for citizens and civil servants. Estonia is not the only country in Europe
where digital governance solutions are exemplary. As shown in figure 1, in 2017,
nine out of ten internet users from Estonia regularly exchange information with
the government online. The same is true in countries like Norway, Sweden or
Denmark. Overall, e-governance usage has been growing in most of Europe during the last ten years. However, in countries like Italy, Bulgaria or Poland, more
than half of the internet users are not engaged in e-governance. How unique
is the Estonian tale of digital modernisation? This work empirically examines

e-governance usage on a European cross-country perspective from 2008 to 2017.
The unit of observation is the national share of internet users that have interacted digitally with their government at least once in the last three months.
The example of the Estonian role model suggests that online governance is most
successful in (1) small countries with (2) a young population, (3) high trust in institutions, and (4) a need for technological renewal. The research question of this
work is if the success determinants of the Estonian example can be generalised in
other countries, too. Mostly, the success of Estonia’s e-governance is assigned to
the historical change the country had after the fall of the iron curtain. In order to
ensure data harmonisation and a minimum level of socio-economic comparability, the analysis focuses on EU countries. This analysis finds references that size,
age, and confidence in legal institutions are indeed related with the development
of electronic governance. However, the argument of technological leapfrogging 3 ,
often suggested in the case of Estonia, can not be confirmed.

Literature

The story of Estonia’s e-governance is celebrated worldwide as an example for
the digital renewal of the social contract. Policy makers and digital entrepreneurs
look jealously at the small Baltic and often explain the country’s high quality and
acceptance of e-services with its unique historical starting point. The argument
of technological leapfrogging is very prominent: After the collapse of the Soviet
Union, Estonia, was left without a functioning system of communication infrastructure. As Toomas Hendrik Ilves, the former Estonian president and key figure
in the post-soviet modernisation, had put it: ”In 1993, Estonia had the telephone
system of 1938” [2]. With little previous communication infrastructure in place,
countries like the early independent Estonia have the chance and need for a
fresh start [3]. However, the literature knows at least three other prerequisites
for high acceptance rates of e-governance. First, size is said to be of advantage.
The initial physical registration of citizens with the digital system and their
subsequent training explain advantages of smaller countries [4, 5]. Secondly, the
demographic structure of the population plays an important role. The larger the
share of digital natives 4 , the less time and effort is required to convince citizens
about the effectiveness and security of digital solutions [5, 6]. Thirdly, successful
digital (government) services demand trust [7–10]. In fact, this aspect is quite
visible for the Estonia case. The entire Estonian e-governance infrastructure is
constructed around the idea that citizens trust their institutions. The credibility

technologies like the internet.

of digital certificates5 or the enforcement of legal consequences in the case of
data abuse6 require institutional credibility [11].
In sum, the success of Estonia’s e-governance is very often explained with
the country’s small population size and the nation’s unique starting settings after the collapse of the Soviet Union. However, several other smaller countries
in Europe had similar, supposedly favourable, initial conditions for building a
successful e-governance infrastructure. The scope of the following analysis is to
highlight the particular features that might explain high e-governance participation rates in Europe with the blueprint of the Estonian success story. The
analysis examines, if the most important, features of the Estonian e-governance
success are of systematic importance for high e-governance usage in Europe.

Data

The investigation makes use of three different data sources. First, measures about
the usage of digital services (egov ), as well as the information about population size7 (pop), and demographic structure8 (age) is derived from the Eurostat
database. The value of egov refers to the share of internet users that have interacted digitally with the government at least once in the last three months9 .
The prerequisites for this measure are two-fold. First, governments must provide
the necessary infrastructure and citizens need to be willing to engage with it.
Secondly, the European Social Survey, supplies a measure of trust in institutions (trstlgl )10 . Lastly, the Worldbank database yields information about the
development of the last generation telecommunications infrastructure, which is
measure with the number of fixed telephone lines per 100 inhabitants (tlph). In
addition, the variable svt indicates if the country had been a part of the Soviet
Union11 . The final dataset contains 288 observations. It includes 27 countries
and covers the years 2008 to 201712 .

Similarly, Eurostat tracks the number of internet users that have a) visited a governmental page, b) downloaded documents from, or c) uploaded files to a web-page of
their government. Of all three e-governance measures, egov correlated strongly with
the remaining three indicators.
The survey question reads: ”...please tell me on a score of 0-10 how much you personally trust the legal system in your country. 0 means you do not trust the institution
at all, and 10 means you have complete trust.”

Where possible, missing values of trstlgl and tlph are imputed with the values of the

Results

First, the four potential drivers of e-governance usage, size, age, trust, and technological leapfrogging are examined in a sample of countries with the lowest
and highest e-governance rates in 2017. One possible explanation for the success
of the Estonian model is population size. The digital transformation of public
services is easier in smaller countries. The data supports this line of reasoning.
In 2017, the five countries with the highest rates of e-governance interaction
contribute to five percent of the sample’s population13 , while the five countries
with the lowest interaction rates make up 35 percent of the sample14 . Similarly,
it is said that e-governance services are easier to establish in relatively young
societies. However, the top-bottom comparison shows a different picture. The
age-dependency ratio in the five top performing countries (55.70) is three percent
points higher than in the bottom five (52.60). Trust in institutions is outlined
as a third prerequisite for successful e-governance. The top-bottom comparison
strengthens this claim. In 2017, individuals from top performing countries report
significantly higher levels of trust (6,24) in their legal institutions than citizens
of the bottom five (4,87). Lastly, it is assumed that countries with a weak communication infrastructure in the past face a greater pressure for adopting digital
governance. Estonia, which was left with a dysfunctional communication infrastructure after Soviet times, is a good example for this case. However, this case
can not be generalised. The count of fixed telephone lines per 100 inhabitants is
the same for bottom (33 percent) and top (30 percent) countries. At the same
time, three of the low performing countries have been under Soviet influence,
while Estonia is the only post-soviet country among the top five.
After this first impression, a more comprehensive analysis of the sample follows. Figure 2 summaries the relationship between the key variables of interest
in all 27 countries from 2008 to 2017. Three countries with low (Poland), middle
(the UK), and high levels (Finland) of e-governance interaction are highlighted.
In quadrant A, a general positive tendency between age and e-governance interaction is visible. For most countries, like the UK and Poland, the level of
egov remains constant over time. Quadrant B shows a clearly positive relationship between citizens’ trust in legal institutions and e-governance interaction.
This pattern is time invariant for almost all countries. In quadrant C, we find
no clear overall relationship between last generation’s telecommunication and
e-governance. However, for some countries, like Finland and Poland, this relationship is negative over time. Lastly, quadrant D shows the comparison of
e-governance between countries with and without a Soviet past. In fact, interaction rates are rather high in countries that have not been under Soviet influence.
The empirical analysis is completed by a regression models in table 1. The
dependent variable is egov, while pop, age, tlph, and trstlgl are selected as independent variables. The comparison in figure 2 shows that some of the dependent

variables have no impact on e-governance interaction over time, while in some
countries a within-country relationship is visible. Therefore a random effects
model is selected [12]: yit = Xit β + uit . For every country (i) and year (t), the
governance usage rate (yit ) is explained by the set of dependent variables (Xit β).
The results of the random effects model confirm most of the observations
made after the top-bottom comparison. Population size, in the full model (5),
is negatively related to egov. Interestingly for age, we see a positive relationship
with e-governance usage. This contradicts the widely held assumption about the
advancement of digital governance in younger societies. As expected, trust in
legal institutions shows a strong and positive association with egov. The degree
of previous communication infrastructure, measured in fixed telephone lines per
100 capita, is not statistically related to e-governance usage, in the full model.

Fig. 3. For the year 2017, predicted and actual e-governance interaction rates are compared. The cross-validation slightly underestimates high values and overestimates low
rates.

As an additional check for the validity of model (6), including pop, age, and
trstlgl, a cross-validation is performed. With a truncated sample, containing the
years 2008 to 2016, the values of egov for the sample’s last year are estimated.
The relationship between actual and fitted values for 2017 is shown in figure 3.
The in-sample estimation works well, on average. The values for countries at the
lower end of the spectrum are slightly overestimated, while the opposite is the
case for countries with high levels of e-governance interaction.

Conclusion

Countries like Estonia, have become the role models for the digital renewal of
the social contract. The Estonian example suggests that e-governance is most
accepted in small countries, overcoming dysfunctional past communication infrastructure, with a young population that shares high trust in institutions. At
least the first two aspects are frequently mentioned in the form of anecdotal
evidence, but rarely tested empirically, on a macro-level. Here, the validity of
the four drivers of digital modernisation is analysed in a sample of 27 European
countries between 2008 and 2017. As for population size, the investigation confirms that e-governance usage is higher in small countries. For age, however, the
Estonian case is contested. E-governance usage rates are higher in older societies.
Clearly, the argument of trust is supported by the empirical evidence. Where citizens have high levels of trust in their legal institutions, e-governance interaction
is high. Lastly, the results do not support the argument of leapfrogging. Previous generation’s communication infrastructure is not related to e-governance
interaction rates. Likewise, post-soviet countries on average have no advantage in
adapting digital governance. The Estonian success story of digital modernisation
does clearly not apply universally in Europe.
This work should serve as a starting point for future in-depth investigations. In particular, for countries in which the gap between predicted and actual
e-governance usage is largest (Figure 3), case studies could deliver valuable findings that explain divergence. Two particularly interesting cases would be Latvia
and Lithuania that share Estonia’s strategic advantage of size and history condition, but are not as successful with regard to e-governance usage as their eastern
Baltic neighbour.
