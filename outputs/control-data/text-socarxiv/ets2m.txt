Gender Ideology and Religion: Does a Masculine Image of God Matter?

Abstract
A number of recent studies explore predictors of gender ideology due to its consistent influence
on a range of outcomes. Another growing body of research investigates the effects of images of
God on an assortment of attitudes. This study unites these two strands of research to provide an
account of the association between religious belief and gender ideology. Using data from a
national random survey and multivariate analysis, I examine whether a masculine image of God
is significantly associated with a more conservative gender ideology. The results demonstrate
that viewing God as a “he” is robustly associated with a more traditional gender ideology.

INTRODUCTION
Gender role attitudes have changed dramatically in the United States over the last half
century (Davis and Greenstein 2009). The earlier widespread acceptance of a strict gendered
division of labor is no longer a dominant view (Bolzendahl and Myers 2004). Discovering what
influences gender role attitudes is of continued importance however due to the effect gender
ideology has regarding a number of issues including marital happiness, fertility, educational
outcomes, and the division of household labor (see Davis and Greenstein 2009). Despite the
widespread shift throughout society, conservative gender ideologies still persist, especially
among religious individuals (Hertel and Hughes 1987; Peek, Lowe, and Williams 1991). Past
research demonstrates religion is a consistent predictor of a person’s gender ideology.
Images of God are a measure of religion that continue to exhibit strong explanatory
power regarding a diverse assortment of outcomes including moral absolutism, political views,
punitive ideologies, volunteerism, and trust (Froese and Bader 2007, 2008, 2010; Froese, Bader,
and Smith 2008; Mencken, Bader, and Embry 2009; Unnever, Bartkowski, and Cullen 2010).
These studies commonly employ active, angry, and loving images of God as independent
measures. The consistent association of these various God images to such a wide variety of
potential outcomes lends support to investigating the possible influence of a gendered image of
God. The importance placed upon masculine images of God by feminist theologians and the
consequences of male images of God discovered through qualitative research provide further
impetus for exploring gendered images of God, especially regarding gender ideology. This study
aims to advance the current knowledge concerning gender ideology, religion, and images of God
by introducing a quantitative assessment of the influence of masculine conceptions of God.

Using a national, random sample of American adults, I provide a quantitative
examination of the association between a gendered image of God and gender ideology. Bivariate
and multivariate analyses suggest that a masculine image of God is strongly associated with a
conservative gender ideology. In fact, viewing God as a “he” is consistently the strongest
predictor of a traditional gender ideology.

GENDER IDEOLOGY AND RELIGION
Continued investigations into what influences gender ideology are important considering
its vast and varied effects: employment and family trade-offs (Ammons and Edgell 2007;
Corrigall and Konrad 2007), post-secondary education aspirations (especially in young girls)
(Davis and Pearce 2007), marital quality (Amato and Booth 1995; Wilcox and Nock 2006),
marital decision making (Godwin and Scanzoni 1989; Scanzoni and Kingsbury 1989; Sexton and
Perlman 1989; Zvonkovic, Greaves, Schmiege, and Hall 1996), paternal involvement with
children (Bulanda 2004; Gaunt 2006), marital stability (Davis and Greenstein 2004), perceived
equity in household labor (Braun et al. 2008; Greenstein 1996; Lavee and Katz 2002), fertility
and relationship transitions (Cunningham et al. 2005), and housework patterns (Blair and Lichter
1991; Presser 1994; Ross 1987).
In general, these studies account for both interest-based and exposure-based explanations
of an individuals’ gender ideology (Bolzendahl and Myers 2004; Davis and Greenstein 2009).
Interest-based explanations hinge on the idea that if an individual can benefit from gender
equality, he or she will be more likely to hold egalitarian beliefs. Therefore, because women
typically occupy a position where equality would be beneficial, they tend to embrace egalitarian
values. That females support more egalitarian gender ideologies is strongly supported
(Bolzendahl and Myers 2004; Brooks and Bolzendahl 2004; Cunningham et al. 2005; Fan and

2

Marini 2000; Thornton and Young-DeMarco 2001). Exposure-based explanations include
socialization, parental ideologies, education level, marital status, parenthood, and labor force
participation (Bolzendahl and Myers 2004; Brooks and Bolzendahl 2004; Ciabattari 2001;
Corrigall and Konrad 2007; Cunningham et al. 2005; Davis and Greenstein 2009; Fan and
Marini 2000; Moore and Vanneman 2003; Myers and Booth 2002).
Religion is a key exposure-based explanation. The connection between religion and
traditional gender attitudes is supported by a long line of research. Studies find various measures
of religion to be significantly associated with differing attitudes toward gender roles
(Abouchedid and Nasser 2007; Bang, Hall, Anderson, and Willingham 2005; Bartkowski and Xu
2000Davidman 1991; Gay, Ellison, and Powers 1996; Heaton and Cornwall 1989; Hertel and
Hughes 1987; Peek et al. 1991; Read and Bartkowski 2000). Generally, religious individuals and
couples are much more likely to support the idea that men are supposed to inhabit the public
sphere while women are meant to take care of the domestic or private sphere. Religion’s
influence on gender ideologies is usually measured in three ways: religious affiliation, worship
service attendance, and biblical literalism. By understanding where a person worships
researchers find distinctions in the common gender ideology portrayed by each religious
tradition. By and large, individuals within conservative Protestant denominations tend to support
more traditional gender roles for men and women (Bang et al. 2005; Bartkowski 2001; Denton
2004; Gallagher 2003; Gallagher and Smith 1999; Gay et al. 1996; Heaton and Cornwall 1989;
Hertel and Hughes 1987; Peek et al. 1991). Beyond religious affiliation, levels of religious
service attendance also influences gender ideologies (Ammons and Edgell 2007; Hertel and
Hughes 1987; Petersen and Donnenwerth 1998). In essence, to maintain traditional gender role
beliefs, no matter the religious tradition, individuals must have regular interaction with like-

3

minded persons (Abouchedid and Nasser 2007; Davidman 1991; Read 2003). Finally, even
across different religions, those who hold their holy scriptures in high regard are much more
likely to espouse traditional gender ideologies (Chaves 1997; Davidman 1991; Denton 2004;
Hoffman and Bartkowski 2008; Read 2003).

IMAGES OF GOD AND GENDER IDEOLOGY
A growing body of research supports the theorized influence of an individual’s image of
God. Viewing God as active or angry influences levels of moral absolutism, absolutist sex
attitudes, abortion attitudes, and political views (Bader and Froese 2005; Froese and Bader 2007,
2008, 2010; Froese, Bader, and Smith 2008; Unnever, Bartkowski, and Cullen 2010; Stark 2001;
Whitehead 2010). Various images of God are also associated with happiness, environmental
spending, trust, desire for racial solidarity, volunteerism, and punitive ideologies (CalhounBrown 1999; Greeley 1993; Mencken, Bader, and Embry 2009; Ozorak 2003; Unnever,
Bartkowski, and Cullen 2010; Unnever and Cullen 2006; Unnever, Cullen, and Bartkowski
2006). Focusing on individuals’ images of God is useful because those images serve as windows
into individuals’ moral and philosophical worldviews that they might otherwise have difficulty
verbalizing (Froese and Bader 2010: 147). They help us understand to a greater extent what is
undergirding and perhaps motivating people’s attitudes and beliefs.
In this way, images of God operate as an “ultimate” generalized other. First introduced by
George Herbert Mead (1962), the concept of the generalized other refers to that which
individuals believe to be the attitude of the entire community or the common expectations held
by society surrounding them. The generalized other allows individuals to take an objective and
abstract view of themselves and their own actions. It in many ways functions as an internal
conversation partner that can serve to motivate or restrict a person’s behaviors or beliefs. Peter

4

Berger (1969), in his discussion of religion and worldview-maintenance, applies some of Mead’s
ideas. Berger shows how religion functions to legitimize social institutions by legitimating
certain roles. As women and men begin to identify themselves with certain roles they look to
others and a generalized other more specifically to concur with their identification. When the
identification process is perceived to originate from cosmic truth the role takes on added
significance. A conception of God as establishing and maintaining a role provides the individual
with a firm foundation on which to stand in the midst of change around her. In this way, Berger
writes, “God then becomes the most reliable and ultimately significant other” (1969: 38). God, or
the person’s conception of God, becomes an internal conversation partner, a generalized other.
More recent work on images of God builds upon Mead and Berger’s ideas (Froese and
Bader 2010). How individuals view God acts as a sounding board through which they work to
interpret their reality. God as the “ultimate” generalized other becomes not only an object of
contemplation but also interaction. As Froese and Bader point out, people often ask, “What will
God think? How would God respond to this? Which path does God want me to follow?” (2010:
9-10). By knowing how an individual views God researchers can gain insight into why she holds
certain attitudes and behaves in a particular manner.
A gendered image of God operates in much the same way. The person who believes God
is male is signifying an underlying assumption of a gendered nature of reality. The “male” image
of God functions as a prism though which life and social structures are interpreted. As Berger
(1969) points out, when certain social roles are legitimized through cosmic means, those roles
take on added significance. Therefore, the assumption of an underlying gendered nature to reality
will strongly influence gender roles and ideology. As Gallagher (2003) found in her study of
Evangelicals, if God is a male and men are a direct representation of God, women who defy

5

men’s authority are also defying God and the gendered order of reality. Furthermore, a number
of feminist theologians point to the pervasive influence of the assumption of an underlying
gendered reality as well as the consequences of viewing God as male. Both serve to legitimate
traditional gender ideologies and patriarchal societal arrangements (Daly 1973, 1985; Lindsey
1990; Morton 1985; Stone 1976). Carol P. Christ argues:
“Religions centered on the worship of a male God create ‘moods’ and
‘motivations’ that keep women in a state of psychological dependence on men
and male authority, while at the same time legitimating the political and social
authority of fathers and sons in the institutions of society” (1987: 164).
Christ contends that due to the powerful effect of religious symbols on individuals and the
surrounding culture, viewing God as male is akin to passively allowing the gender ideologies and
social structures that inhibit females to continue as well. In this view, the consequences of a
patriarchal view of God are not limited to religious individuals. Even those who are completely
secularized will be influenced due to the prevalence of the male God imagery in the surrounding
culture. Thus, cultures containing religions that worship a “male” God are influenced by the
“moods” and “motivations” created by that system of religious symbols that legitimate and
perpetuate social inequality in both ideology and practice.
Research of the effects of holding gendered views of God is less common compared to
the application of active, angry, or loving images of God. One study does find that a maternal
image of God is correlated with more liberal political views (Greeley 1988). Pevey, Williams,
and Ellison (1996) provide a qualitative study of the use of a male image of God by women in a
Southern Baptist Sunday school class. They found that while a male God image could be used by
females as a resource in their interaction with men, the hierarchical relationship between the

6

sexes was maintained. For example, women still could not hold office within the church. A male
image of God continued to justify the patriarchal arrangement. In addition to these findings, the
effects of a gendered image of God on individuals and on the wider culture is especially
noteworthy in the context of the United States considering that almost half of all Americans
identify their God as a “he” (Froese and Bader 2010).
Due to the pervasive influence of a “male” God-image presented by various feminist
theologians (see Daly 1973, 1985; Christ 1987; Lindsey 1990; Morton 1985; Stone 1976), as
well as the influence various other images of God have on attitudes (see Froese and Bader 2010),
it is important to investigate if viewing God as a “he” is associated with gender ideology.
Furthermore, the possibility that a gendered image of God is consistently and strongly associated
with gender ideology would provide an important addition to what is currently known about the
overall influence of religion on gender role attitudes. This leads us to the following hypothesis:
Viewing God as a “he” will be significantly associated with a more conservative
gender ideology.

DATA
To test this hypothesis I use a random, national sample of individuals to determine the
association between gendered views of God and attitudes toward gender roles. Data for this
study were taken from the second wave (2007) of the Baylor Religion Survey (BRS). The 2007
BRS is a random, national sample of 1,648 U.S. citizens and was administered by the Gallup
Organization. The survey utilized a mixed-mode sampling design consisting of two phases. Both
phases resulted in a total of 3,500 individuals screened [1,000 in phase 1 + 2,500 in phase 2] with
2,460 possible respondents [624 from phase 1 + 1,836 from phase 2]. A total of 1,648
questionnaires were returned resulting in a response rate of 47% [1,648/3,500] among all

7

individuals screened and a response rate of 67% [1,648/2,460] for those who agreed to receive a
mailed survey. This response rate is within the normal parameters for RDD samples (see Froese
and Bader 2010). Additionally, the BRS compares favorably to similar items on the General
Social Survey (Bader, Mencken, and Froese 2007). The BRS is ideal for this research question
because it contains an unequaled number of questions pertaining to religion, allowing for a more
thorough examination of religion’s varied effects on gender ideology.

Dependent Variable
The dependent variable in this study is a scale focused on attitudes toward gender roles.
Four items constitute this scale, indicating the degree to which individuals believe most men are
better suited for politics, a preschool child is likely to suffer if his or her mother works, it is
God’s will that women care for children, and finally, a husband should earn a larger salary than
his wife. These items are widely used to construct gender ideology scales (see Davis and
Greenstein 2009). Possible responses ranged from “Strongly Agree” (5) to “Strongly Disagree”
(1). Each of the items loads on the scale above .5 on the factor that was extracted. These items
were therefore combined into an index with a Cronbach’s alpha of .74. The gender ideology
scale ranges from a minimum score of 4 to a maximum score of 20. The mean is 10.05 and the
standard deviation is 3.76 (See Table 1). Higher scores on the scale correspond to more
conservative stances concerning gender roles.

Independent Variable
The independent variable of interest to this study concerns respondents’ view of God’s
gender. Respondents were asked “Based on your personal understanding, what do you think
God is like: A ‘He.’” Possible responses ranged from “Strongly Agree” (5) to “Strongly

8

Disagree” (1) with the option to answer “Undecided.” This variable was coded such that higher
scores correspond to more masculine views of God with “undecided” responses in the middle.

Control Variables
Building upon past research, a collection of religion measures is included in the model to
ensure gendered images of God are truly associated with gender ideology beyond religious
behavior, affiliation, and belief. To gauge religious behavior, I created an index combining
frequency of church attendance, frequency of prayer/meditation, and frequency of reading sacred
scriptures. The questions for both attendance and scripture reading range from “Several times a
week” (9) to “Never” (1). The frequency of prayer measure ranges from “Several times a day”
(6) to “Never” (1). Factor analysis showed that these items load together on the same factor
above .85. Due to the differences in unit of measurement for these questions, they were
standardized and then summed. The Cronbach’s alpha of the resulting index is .84. This measure
of religious involvement is a significant improvement over using only attendance to assess the
influence of religious behavior on gender ideology because it captures the concept of religious
practice across a variety of traditions. Past research, due to data limitations, was unable to
include such a measure.
Religious affiliation is measured using the RELTRAD typology which categorizes
individuals into seven religious traditions: Evangelical Protestant, Mainline Protestant, Catholic,
Jew, Black Protestant, other, and no religion (Steensland et al. 2000). Evangelical Protestants
will serve as the contrast category because they consistently espouse the most conservative
gender ideology in past research (Bang et al. 2005; Denton 2004; Gallagher and Smith 1999;
Gay et al. 1996; Heaton and Cornwall 1989; Hertel and Hughes 1987; Peek et al. 1991). I also
utilize a question concerning respondents’ view of the Bible to account for religious belief. The

9

question asks “Which one statement comes closest to your personal beliefs about the Bible?”
Possible responses were “The Bible means exactly what it says. It should be taken literally,
word-for-word, on all subjects,” “The Bible is perfectly true, but it should not be taken literally,
word-for-word. We must interpret its meaning,” “The Bible contains some human error,” and
“The Bible is an ancient book of history and legends.” This variable was dichotomized such that
those individuals responding that the Bible should be taken literally, otherwise known as biblical
literalists, were coded as a one with all others being coded as a zero.
In addition to assessing the various effects of religion, a host of socio-demographic
controls common in past studies of gender ideology are included as well. Age (in years), region
of the country (South = 1), race (White = 1), gender (Female = 1), whether or not unemployed
female respondents identify as a “homemaker” (homemaker = 1), children in the home (yes = 1),
income ($10,000 or less, $10,001-$20,000, $20,001-$35,000, $35,001-$50,000, $50,001$100,000, $100,001-$150,000, and $150,000 or more), and education (8th or less; 9-12th no
diploma, high school graduate, some college, trade/technical/vocational training, college
graduate, postgraduate work/degree) are all included in the analysis. A series of dichotomous
variables was created to account for the varying effects of marital status on gender ideology. For
example, past research shows differences in gender ideology exist between married individuals
and those who are divorced or separated (Davis and Greenstein 2009). Respondents who signify
they are married will serve as the contrast category against which cohabitating, separated,
divorced, widowed, and never married individuals will be compared. Finally, politically
conservative individuals also tend to hold conservative views of men’s and women’s roles. A
measure of political conservatism is included in the analysis as well; possible responses range

10

from “conservative” (3) to “liberal” (1) with moderates falling in between. These responses
were ordered so higher scores correspond to more conservative political views.

METHOD
I will first analyze the descriptive characteristics of the key variables included in this
study as well as a bivariate analysis of viewing God as a “he” and the gender ideology index. I
will then progress to a multivariate test of the hypothesis. Due to the nature of the dependent
variable, I utilized Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression to model these relationships.1 Three
separate analyses were conducted and are presented. The first model displays the independent
variable of interest only. The second model includes the religious belief, behavior, and affiliation
measures.2 The final model adds all of the socio-demographic control variables. This step-wise
analysis will allow for comparisons to be made between models concerning the changing effects
of each of the variables as well as the differences in the amount of explained variance.

RESULTS
Table 1 shows that most individuals fall somewhere in the middle of the gender ideology
index. Table 1 also reveals that the mean response for believing God is a “he” is more toward
agreement rather than disagreement. In Figure 1 the results of a bivariate difference of means test
are displayed. The mean score on the gender ideology index for those who view God as a “he” is
11.51. This is significantly different (p<.001) from the mean score on the gender ideology index
for those who are either undecided or do not view God as a “he.” Rather, the mean score for
those who do not imagine God is male is 8.63; significantly more egalitarian. There are
considerable differences between those who view God as a “he” and those who do not
concerning gender ideology. This provides preliminary support for the hypothesis.
11

[Figure 1 about here]
In table 2 the OLS regression coefficients for each model are presented.3 Model 1
contains only the gendered image of God measure. As expected, it is significantly associated
with a more conservative gender ideology and explains a great deal of the variance in the
dependent variable (Adjusted R² = 0.20). Model 2 includes all of the religion controls to ensure
that the association between viewing God as a “he” and gender ideology is robust and not
explaining the same variance as religious belief, behavior, and affiliation. Despite the inclusion
of this collection of religion controls, viewing God as a “he” is still significantly associated with
a more conservative gender ideology. The addition of these variables attenuates the standardized
effect of the male image of God measure by a little over a third. However, the standardized beta
of the masculine image of God measure is still almost twice as large as those for biblical
literalism, religious practice, and affiliation. In line with past research, those who view the bible
literally are much more likely to espouse a traditional gender ideology. Individuals who exhibit
higher rates of religious practice are also more likely to take a conservative view of gender roles.
Finally, Evangelical Protestants hold more conservative gender ideologies than Black
Protestants, Mainline Protestants, Catholics, and the unaffiliated. Including these religion
measures in the model increases the amount of total variance explained as well.
Model 3 in table 2 displays the full model containing the masculine image of God
measure, religious belief, behavior and affiliation, as well as a host of socio-demographic control
variables supported in previous research on gender ideology. Viewing God as a “he” maintains
its significant association and its effect is further attenuated but by a much smaller degree.
Despite this attenuation, a masculine image of God is still the strongest predictor in the model.
As before, individuals who imagine God as a “he” tend to ascribe to a more conservative gender

12

ideology. This finding provides strong support for the hypothesis driving this analysis. Turning
to the other religion measures, those who are biblical literalists and frequently practice their
religion are both more likely to hold a conservative gender ideology as well. The inclusion of the
demographic variables has a profound effect on the religious affiliation measures. By controlling
for these various socio-demographic measures, the previously significant differences between
Evangelical Protestants and Black Protestants, Mainline Protestants, and Catholics disappear.
The differences in gender ideology still exist between Evangelicals and the unaffiliated however.
Apparently, religious affiliation matters little concerning gender ideology. Rather, it is
individuals’ view of God and to a lesser extent their reading of the Bible and their level of
religious practice that account for religion’s influence on gender ideology once controlling for
socio-demographics.
Concerning the socio-demographic measures, increasing age and living in the south are
associated with a more conservative gender ideology. Likewise, women who consider
themselves “homemakers” are also more likely to hold a more conservative gender ideology.
Political conservatism is a very strong predictor of gender conservatism. Females are much less
likely than males to espouse a conservative gender ideology. Income is negatively associated
with ascription to traditional gender roles. Finally, compared to married individuals, divorcees
are less likely to be gender traditionalists. There are no significant differences between whites
and non-whites concerning gender ideology. Having children in the home is not significantly
associated with the gender ideology index. Surprisingly, neither is education.4 Also, married
individuals are not significantly different from cohabitating, separated, widowed, or never
married individuals. Including the socio-demographic measures substantially increased the total
variance explained from Model 2 (Adjusted R² = 0.27) to Model 3 (Adjusted R² = 0.37).

13

Additionally, including the religion and socio-demographic controls almost doubled the total
variance explained from Model 1 (Adjusted R² = 0.20) to Model 3 (Adjusted R² = 0.37).

DISCUSSION
These results demonstrate that a masculine image of God is significantly associated with
a more conservative gender ideology and provide strong support for the hypothesis. Individuals
who believe God is a male are more likely to believe most men are better suited for politics, a
preschool child is likely to suffer if his or her mother works, it is God’s will that women care for
children, or that a husband should earn a larger salary than his wife. This significant association
is net of religious affiliation, belief, and practice as well as a number of socio-demographic
measures. Additionally, a male image of God is consistently the strongest predictor of a
conservative gender ideology. This analysis serves to integrate and advance two current strands
of research. It advances the study of gender ideologies by exhibiting a relationship between
gender ideology and a particular religious belief heretofore unexamined in the literature through
quantitative means. Likewise, it furthers the study of images of God through demonstrating how
a particular God-image is associated with yet another important outcome. While a modest
addition to the wealth of research coming before, this study fills a genuine gap in the literature.
Future studies of religion’s influence on gender ideology should account for the effect of a
masculine image of God.
The strong association between viewing God as a “he” and a conservative gender
ideology lends further support to past qualitative research that connected masculine images of
God with believing in an underlying gendered nature of reality (Gallagher 2003). Individuals
who believe God is male, and especially females, will be less likely to question or subvert male

14

authority because men are believed to represent God’s authority on Earth. To counter men’s
authority would be to question the entire ordering of the cosmos. As Gallagher explains
concerning such a view, “the subordination of women to men is . . . the essence of what it means
to be ‘created in the image of God’” and “these ideas of a gendered hierarchy of authority are not
just relational; they are reality, embodied in physiology and stretching throughout the created
order to the person of God” (2003:172-173). Such views of God and the nature of reality are
incredibly important because they serve to legitimize the roles into which individuals are
socialized (Berger 1969). This is the same argument made by various feminist theologians
regarding the influence of a masculine image of God. They too maintain that these views serve to
legitimize certain social arrangements and provide support for longstanding patriarchal
structures. For them though, the influence of a masculine image of God reaches beyond religious
individuals. The results from this study support this assertion as well; regardless of belief about
the bible or the level of religious practice, if a person views God as a “he,” she will be much
more likely to support a conservative gender ideology. In this way, the effects of a masculine
image of God truly are pervasive throughout a culture even if not everyone is traditionally
religious (Christ 1987).
Beyond the influence of viewing God as a “he,” the continuing importance of religious
belief and practice concerning gender ideology is also confirmed. Individuals who believe the
Bible should be read literally are highly likely to ascribe to more traditional roles for men and
women. Furthermore, those who practice their religion with a high degree of regularity, attending
worship services weekly or more, reading sacred scriptures daily, or praying continually, are also
more likely to embrace a conservative gender ideology. The present account allows for a more
complete understanding of the influence of various possible religious behaviors on gender

15

ideology. Also of importance is recognizing the lack of influence religious affiliation has on
one’s gender ideology. Apart from the differences between Evangelical Protestants and the
unaffiliated, no other religious traditions differ significantly from Evangelicals regarding gender
ideology. Including the socio-demographic measures completely washed out any effect for which
religious tradition accounted.5 An absence of difference between religious traditions is not
entirely surprising (Wuthnow 1988).
The effects of socio-demographic characteristics supported in previous research receive
additional support in this analysis. Age, gender, income, conservative political views, and being
divorced all influence gender ideology. Females who identify as homemakers are also
significantly more likely to hold a traditional view of gender roles. In many ways, these females
might need a conservative gender ideology to provide needed cognitive support for their social
role and identity. It would not be surprising if self-identified homemakers would be much more
likely to believe God is a “he” as well. Subsequent research should investigate the extent to
which this is the case. The most surprising result is the non-significance of education. As
previously noted (see footnote 4), both the masculine image of God and income measures are
responsible for the non-significance of the education measure. It is possible that much of
education’s effect on gender ideology might be accounted for indirectly through both income and
images of God. In this sense, education might directly affect a person’s image of God and
income level which in turn directly influence his or her gender ideology. At this stage, this is
merely speculation, as a proper test of this possibility is beyond the scope of the present analysis.
Future research might investigate the direct and indirect effects of education on gender ideology
using more advanced methodological techniques.

16

This study provides a number of other possible directions for future research. First,
potential studies might focus on who is most likely to view God as a “he.” Are there differences
by gender, income, education, or marital status? Qualitative research suggests that females might
be more likely to view God as a “he” (Pevey, Williams, and Ellison 1996). Considering that
females are more likely to ascribe to a more liberal gender ideology it is somewhat paradoxical
that they would also be more likely to hold a masculine image of God; this is especially true
considering the present study demonstrates that this particular view of God is strongly associated
with a conservative gender ideology. It is possible that a masculine image of God is functioning
as both a schema and resource (Sewell 2005). While a male God-image serves to pattern
thoughts and behaviors it might also be used to gain power in situations, patriarchal religious
organizations especially, where females are generally denied leadership positions. Pevey and
colleagues’ findings suggest this possibility when they write how the women in their study
gained power from the male God image because if they were unhappy with their husband’s
actions, they could report their dissatisfaction to the biggest “male” in the universe and thereby
gain power and respect indirectly (Pevey et al. 1996: 184).
Second, future investigations might focus on the effects of other types of images of God
on gender ideology. Does viewing God as “fatherly” or “motherly” operate in the same manner
as viewing God as a “he?” Different data sources might also be useful in providing varied
examinations of the association between gendered images of God and gender ideology. Finally,
future studies should continue to investigate the influence of various images of God. The images
of God concept allows researchers a view of respondents’ underlying moral or philosophical
worldview that they otherwise might have trouble verbalizing (Froese and Bader 2010). Whether

17

God as they imagine it exists or not is irrelevant; the key is that the individual believes it is so,
and thus the consequences of that belief are quite real (Thomas 1929).
One important limitation of this study is the data utilized in this investigation is crosssectional which makes any inquiry of cause-and-effect relationships impossible. There is no way
to conclude with any reliability that a male image of God causes conservative gender ideologies.
It is just as likely that a conservative gender ideology influences individuals to view God as a
male. It is also possible that shifts in a person’s gender ideology could cause their view of God to
change, moving from a more to less masculine image. It is entirely likely that the relationship
between a gendered image of God and gender ideology is reciprocal with both actively
influencing the other. For this reason, it is essential that future research in this area utilize
longitudinal data which would be able to better establish whether or not a male God image in
fact causes a conservative gender ideology, or the reverse. Further research on gendered images
of God and gender ideologies using qualitative means would also inform this discussion. Another
limitation is the inability to account for the influence of various institutions, most notably
congregations, of which the individuals in the study are a part. It is entirely possible that
contextual effects arise concerning a groups’ image of God that influence the individual and are
antecedent to their personal God image. However, this possibility would complement rather than
contradict the findings presented here. As before, qualitative research devoted to investigating
this possibility would do much to inform this line of research. Despite these limitations, this
study offers strong support for the importance of accounting for gendered images of God when
investigating gender ideology. This underscores the significance of individuals’ religious beliefs
on other social spheres.

CONCLUSION

18

The effects of a conservative gender ideology are well established and far reaching. What
individuals’ decide as the proper role for each sex influences their employment, home life,
parenting style, and marital satisfaction, among other outcomes (Davis and Greenstein 2009).
For this reason, future research must continue to investigate what influences gender ideology.
Past studies establish the consistent influences of socio-demographic and religion measures on
the gender ideologies people maintain. Building upon this work, the present analysis
demonstrates that beyond socio-demographic characteristics and the religious beliefs, behaviors,
and affiliations individuals exhibit, a masculine image of God is strongly related to gender
ideology. If God is perceived to be male, a conservative gender ideology is more likely.
Conversely, an egalitarian gender ideology is to be expected if God is not believed to be a “he.”
Feminist theologians and past theorists are correct in their estimation of the influence of a male
God-image. For many individuals, a male “ultimate” generalized other serves to legitimate their
gender ideologies that in turn function to perpetuate hierarchical arrangements in contemporary
society (Berger 1969; Christ 1987).

I analyzed the error residuals of each of the models and performed additional analyses using

Tobit regression to ensure OLS regression was producing legitimate results. Tobit is designed to
model linear relationships when the dependent variable is bounded. The results from these
analyses confirm that OLS regression is suitable for modeling the gender ideology scale as a
dependent variable. First, this analysis satisfies assumptions regarding error terms in OLS
Regression. The mean of the residuals is equal to zero, the residuals are normally distributed, and
the residuals are not correlated with any of the independent variables. Second, the additional
analyses performed using Tobit regression modeling were neither statistically nor substantively
different compared to the OLS models for any of the variables included in the models.
2

Multicollinearity is a common concern when a large number of religion variables are included

in a regression model. The variance inflation scores for each of the independent variables in this
analysis never exceed 1.8 in any of the models. Therefore, the level of multicollinearity in this
model is acceptable and can be assumed to not adversely affect the results.
3

Analyses were conducted on the missing data to ensure that excluded respondents do not differ

significantly on the dependent measure compared to those respondents retained in the analysis.
Results reveal that respondents excluded from the analysis due to missing values are not
significantly different from those included in the analysis.
4

In additional analyses I explored which measures render education non-significant. Rotating in

and out each individual measure included in the final model I found that education achieved a
negative and significant association (p<.01) with a conservative gender ideology when either one
of the following measures was excluded: income and viewing God as a “he.” Surprisingly,
excluding political conservatism or the female measure (two of the strongest predictors in the

33

model) does not serve to change education’s non-significant association. I return to this issue in
the discussion section.
5

Additional analyses were conducted to explore whether the other religion variables were also

rendering religious tradition non-significant or if the socio-demographic measures were solely
responsible. In a model that included all of the socio-demographic variables and the religious
tradition measures but did not include the image of God, biblical literalism, or religious practice
measures, there were significant differences between Evangelical Protestants and Mainline
Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and the unaffiliated respectively. This suggests that regarding
gender ideology, any differences between religious traditions are due instead to differences in
socio-demographic characteristics, religious beliefs, and levels of religious practice between
those traditions.
