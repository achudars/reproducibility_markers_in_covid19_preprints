ABSTRACT A social movement society refers to a society in which protest is a standard,
institutionalized feature of the political landscape. Is the U.S. steadily becoming such a society?
Whereas other empirical tests of the movement society thesis have focused on political tactics
and individual participation in protest, we point to the public’s attitudes as another indicator of
the movement society. Using General Social Survey data, we find that the public has grown more
accepting of protest with time. In addition, using indicators of social location, social engagement,
and political engagement as predictors, we find that while these factors help explain support for
protest, their effects vary depending on the type of protest in question. Age, education, gender,
income, employment status, and political interest all affect the acceptance of public meetings and
demonstrations; however, the effect of income is reversed when it comes to the acceptance of a
nationwide strike. Lastly, an age-period-cohort analysis finds evidence that a period effect is
greater than a cohort effect in changing attitudes over time. Taken together, these findings
support the claim that broad, societal-level influences have contributed to the public acceptance
of protest, which is suggestive of a social movement society. Yet while the U.S. may constitute a
social movement society, it is one with clear boundaries: individuals do support protest, but only
to the extent that it does not disrupt the material advantages associated with their social location.

Becoming a Movement Society? Patterns in the Public Acceptance of Protest, 1985 - 2006
The widespread protest that has occurred since Donald Trump’s 2017 inauguration
provides a powerful illustration of the myriad ways in which protesters come together to air
grievances and press for social change. Protesters have participated in public meetings in their
towns, in marches and demonstrations in many cities and states, and have organized various
nationwide strikes such as the “Day Without Immigrants” and the March 8, 2017 Women’s
Strike. Though they may vary widely, all acts of protest share the goal of communicating an
oppositional message to some external audience (Jasper 1997), such as targets or authorities. In
this article we examine protest from the perspective of one of those audiences: the general
public. Specifically, we use data from the General Social Survey (GSS) to analyze the public
acceptance of protest. We ask: does the public accept protest? Has the acceptance of protest
changed over time? If the acceptance of protest has changed over time, what is driving that
change? And what predicts whether or not members of the public find protest acceptable?
These questions allow us to engage in a critical examination of a theoretical concept from
the field of social movements: the notion of a “social movement society,” or a society in which
protest has become a routine, institutionalized feature of the political landscape (Meyer and
Tarrow 1998; Soule and Earl 2005; Tarrow 1994). While scholars studying movement societies
have examined various aspects of politics and political behavior, including political
organizations, protest tactics, and individual participation in protest, relatively few scholars
working with this concept have explored the extent to which protest is acceptable in the eyes of
the general public (for an exception see Crozat 1998). Our inquiry therefore serves as a further
test of the “movement society” hypothesis.
Beyond its relevance to discussions about movement societies, we argue that our inquiry
is useful for several reasons. Most generally, by focusing on external movement audiences, this
examination helps address the criticism that social movement research is too “movementcentric” (McAdam and Boudet 2012). Relatedly, a study of the public acceptance of protest
activity helps further our understanding of the environment in which movements operate. Social
movement scholars have long recognized the importance of the political environment for the
success of social movements (e.g., McAdam 1982; McAdam, McCarthy, and Zald 1996).
Because public opinion is a feature of the political environment, it may therefore be relevant to a
movement’s abilities to succeed (Burstein and Linton 2002; Thomas and Louis 2014). Further,
the acceptance of protest may itself be an outcome of social movements as a whole. Of course,
social movement groups strive to achieve their substantive goals. Yet public acceptance of the
movement’s method of political expression, above and beyond the movement’s particular stated
goals, may be understood as an implicit, collective goal shared by all movements.
As we note in more detail below, our study examines the public’s acceptance of three
different types of protest activity, which may be characterized as having increasing amounts of
potential for societal disruption: public meetings, marches and demonstrations, and general
strikes. We do so in recognition of the premise that as acts of protest vary widely, so too can their

2

level of acceptability. Previous research conceptualized such variations in terms of risk or cost,
especially in reference to the experiences of movement participants (McAdam 1988; Nepstad
and Smith 1999). In contrast, what may be relevant or salient for the public is the level of social
disruption associated with various acts of protest. That is, the public may view more contentious
forms of protest differently than those that cause less disruption. As Crozat (1998: 60) notes, “If
protest draws its strength from its contentious nature, then the degree of contentiousness
matters.”
We begin by reviewing the extant work on the concept of the “movement society” and
argue that this research may be extended with an examination of public opinion about protest.
We then present our data, which come from four different years of data collected from the GSS,
and our analyses. We end with a discussion of the implications of our findings for future
research.
The Social Movement Society, Protest, and the Public
Meyer and Tarrow (1998:6) note that an overall decline in violence in collective action in
Western Europe and North America, coupled with an increase in the abilities of “ordinary
people” to stage collective action, suggests that protest may enjoy “acceptability and even
legitimation by elites and authorities.” This insight is reflected in their concept of a “social
movement society,” one in which protest is routinized and accepted (Meyer and Tarrow 1998;
Meyer and Pullum 2015; Taylor 2000). The introduction of this concept has inspired scholars to
examine the institutionalization of protest, including the ways in which protesters who “follow
the rules” enjoy access to political decision-making (Meyer 1993), the extent to which protesters
use “insider” or “outsider” tactics (Soule and Earl 2005), and the ways in which activism has
become part of the corporate world, such as through cause lawyering (Boutcher 2013). An
additional line of work on movement societies explores participation in protest as an indicator of
the movement society, inquiring both about individuals’ potential for participation in protest
(Jenkins, Wallace, and Fullerton 2008) and whether actual participation has increased over time
(Caren, Ghoshal, and Ribas 2011).
We argue for the study of public opinion as another lens with which to view movement
societies. Public opinion has received a fair amount of attention among social movement
researchers. To a certain extent, public opinion can serve as an indicator of a social movement.
For instance, McCright and Dunlap (2008) use public opinion data to find evidence of
progressive social movement ideology. Scholars primarily interested in social movement
outcomes have also incorporated public opinion centrally in their work, examining it either as a
direct consequence of movement activity (Berkowitz 1973) or as a factor that combines with
movement activity to produce other changes of interest, such as policy change (Agnone 2007;
Burstein 1979; Burstein and Freudenburg 1978; Jacobs and Kent 2007; McAdam and Su 2002;
Weaver 2008). More to the point of our inquiry, some studies have focused on public attitudes
about protest itself (as distinct from attitudes about political causes associated with particular
movements). Written during the height of turbulent 1960s, a number of earlier studies concerned

3

themselves with public reactions to protest activity, including examinations of whether the public
saw the collective action of the time as “protest” or “riots” (see Turner 1969). Such work either
explicitly or implicitly focused on the legitimacy of collective action: defining action as “protest”
carried a positive connotation, interpreting it as a legitimate expression of valid grievances,
whereas the label “riot” implied criminality or other deviance.
The concept of a movement society rests on the notion that protest is a standard, accepted
feature of the political landscape. If a movement society exists, then, it should be reflected in
public attitudes about protest. Those who find protest acceptable may be exhibiting a form of
“weak support” for movements (Ennis and Schreur 1987). Even the attitudes of members of the
public who neither support nor oppose social movements are relevant to a social movement
society. Such attitudes held by the “bystander public,” or the segment of the public that does not
necessarily act for or against social movements, are taken into account when movements plan
strategy (Turner 1970). By “witnessing” movement activity (McCarthy and Zald 1977: 1221),
and having opinions about the legitimacy (or illegitimacy) of protest, such publics can therefore
provide further evidence of a movement society.
In what follows, we use public opinion data from national polls to inquire about the
presence and character of a social movement society. We acknowledge that “public opinion” is a
complex concept that is often inadequately measured by polls (Manza and Brooks 2012; Perrin
and McFarland 2011). Our modest goals are to inquire about changing attitudes about protest, as
captured by national polls (in our case, the General Social Survey). Thus, we do not claim that
these data fully express the public’s opinions about protest behavior. However, we find utility in
examining changes in these survey results over time, as we believe that they provide useful
(although incomplete) pictures that help us assess the validity of the concept of a “movement
society.”
Importantly, we examine opinions about different forms of protest. Although earlier
studies assumed differences between acts seen as “protest” and those seen as “riots,” we see a
need for more nuanced distinctions among the various types of actions that constitute standard
repertoires of protest. As Gamson (1990) notes, protest tactics vary in their levels of disruption,
and it is reasonable and plausible to expect that people’s acceptance of protest will vary by the
extent to which protest is seen as disruptive for the public (see also Thomas and Louis 2014). For
instance, the public may be more likely to accept peaceful marches than more violent
confrontations. Second, while some research points to changes in public opinion about protest in
the aftermath of powerful events, such as the assassination of political leaders (Meyer 1969;
Yuchtman-Yaar and Hermann 1998), the literature on public opinion about protest as a whole has
not yet explored the notion that the acceptance of protest may have a temporal and historical
component. But if the U.S. is indeed becoming a “movement society,” we would expect to see
increased acceptance of all types of protest over time. Our inquiry therefore features a
longitudinal study of the public acceptance of protest, one that examines a variety of different
types of protest activities, and explores whether protest is accepted equally by different segments
of society. In the next section, we state our hypotheses more formally.

4

Hypotheses
Our first and second research questions focus on the extent to which the public accepts
protest, and whether or not public acceptance of protest has changed over time. As noted above,
if the U.S. has become a “movement society,” we would find substantial and growing acceptance
of various types of protest. We therefore hypothesize:
H1: Public acceptance of all forms of protest will be greater in 2006 than in 1985.
Our last research question focuses on whether protest acceptance varies across social
locations or is shared more generally by a broad cross-section of society. The concept of a
movement society implies that protest is seen as legitimate by all or most members of the
society. If that is the case, then we would not expect to find differences in the acceptance of
protest among groups characterized by social locations such as race, class, gender, and age;
instead, we would expect that acceptance of protest is more widespread (Meyer and Pullum
2015). However, previous research on public opinion about protest shows that some individual
characteristics such as age, race, occupation, and education are statistically significant predictors
of attitudes toward protest (Hall, Rodeghier, and Useem 1986; Rodeghier, Hall, and Useem
1991). Hall et al. (1986) in particular explain four possible mechanisms for how education,
which has been found to be the most important predictor of such attitudes, affects attitudes
toward protest: more education is associated with 1) stronger support of civil and political
liberties; 2) intolerance of violence; 3) more identification with protest; and 4) more knowledge
of the justifications for protest (see also Hall and Rosenthal 1981). To adjudicate between these
two competing sets of expectations, we hypothesize:
H2: Demographic and socio-economic characteristics of individuals predict their
acceptance of protest.
In addition to socio-demographic factors, social engagement may have an effect on public
support for protest. It has been consistently found that individuals with connections to
organizations or activists are more likely to participate in social movements (Fernandez and
McAdam 1988; Jasper and Poulson 1995; McAdam 1988; McAdam and Paulsen 1993; Snow et
al. 1980); similarly, membership in political or civic organizations and networks with others who
find protest acceptable may shape one’s perspective on protest. This expectation is also in line
with Barkan’s (2004) study of support for the environmental movement, which uses elements of
Verba et al.’s (1995) “civic volunteerism model”; following that model, Barkan argues that
participation in networks such as voluntary organizations can affect support for the movement.
Extending these findings, we hypothesize as follows:
H3: People who are more socially engaged through volunteerism or civic organizations
are more likely to accept protest than those are less socially engaged.
Lastly, the acceptance of protest is a political attitude, and may therefore be shaped by
political engagement. Informed by the political science literature, Schussman and Soule’s (2005)
study of protest participation emphasizes the importance of five dimensions of political
engagement: 1) political interest; 2) political efficacy; 3) political knowledge; 4) party affiliation;

5

and 5) political orientation. Similarly, Corrigall-Brown (2012:18) argues that ideological factors,
such as political efficacy, can shape sympathy for social movements. We extend their work to
hypothesize that political engagement has a positive relationship with the acceptance of protest.
As we explain in more detail below, our dataset only provides indicators of three of the five
dimensions used by Schussman and Soule (2005). Therefore, we hypothesize the following:
H4: Democrats and people with more liberal views or more interest in politics are more
likely to accept protest than Republicans and people with more conservative views or less
interest in politics, respectively.
Data and Methods
We test our hypotheses using repeated cross-sectional data from the General Social
Survey from 1985, 1990, 1996 and 2006, with the last year being the most recent year for which
GSS respondents were asked for their attitudes about protest. The GSS data use a multi-stage
area probability sample to the block level and then use quota sampling based on sex, age, and
employment status at the block level (NORC 2013:2868). To best represent the parameters of the
population, this study invokes weights and accounts for clustering. Although our outcome
variables are available at all four time points, we lack data for our explanatory variables for some
years. Socio-demographic and political engagement variables are available for all four time
points, but measures of social engagement are available only in 1990 and 1996. Therefore, we
use 1990 and 1996 data for some analyses (i.e., the individual-level regression analysis) and data
from all four time points for the descriptive statistics and the other analyses (i.e., the age-periodcohort analysis).
Initially, we dealt with missing data by using multiple imputation (Little and Rubin 1987;
von Hippel 2007). However, the imputation increased only about 11.5 percent of the sample size
for all the full models. In addition, the analysis with multiply imputed data produced largely the
same conclusions as the analysis with listwise deleted data (cf., Allison 2001)1. Therefore, this
study reports regression analysis results from listwise deleted data.
Measures
The outcome variables, acceptance of various forms of protest, are measured by three
items. Respondents were asked if they thought three specific forms of protest should be allowed:
1) public meetings to protest against the government; 2) protest marches and demonstrations; and
3) a nationwide strike of all workers2. In the original data set, respondents were asked to rate the
items with a four point scale from definitely not allowed (1) to definitely allowed (4). We recode
and collapse the four response categories into two—i.e., acceptance (1) and non-acceptance (0).
The 1990-1996 pooled data allow us to include three sets of explanatory variables that are
hypothesized to affect the acceptance of protest. We use eight variables representing sociodemographic factors: a) age; b) educational attainment; c) income; d) labor force status, e)
marital status, f) the existence of household member(s) less than 6 years old; g) sex, and h) race.
Second, social engagement is indicated by measures of either organizational membership or

6

volunteering. In 1990, respondents were asked to report the number of civic organizations of
which they are a member. In 1996, respondents were asked to report the number of areas in
which they have done volunteer work. These two indicators show a similarly right-skewed
distribution, suggesting that they may be proxies of the same concept. Third, political
engagement is measured by three items: a) party affiliation from strong Republican to
independent and strong Democrat; b) political views from extremely conservative to extremely
liberal; and c) interest in politics. Lastly, a dummy variable of the 1996 wave is used to control
for time. Summary statistics for the explanatory and control variables are reported in Appendix A
and full instruments are included in Appendix B.
Analytic Strategy
Data analyses in this study are conducted in two phases. First, we use descriptive
statistics to examine changes in the public’s acceptance of protest over time. Then, upon finding
substantial changes between 1985 and 2006, we conduct an age-period-cohort analysis to tease
out the age, period, and cohort effects on these changes. As we explain in more detail below, we
are particularly interested in the relative impacts of period and cohort effects for the variance in
the acceptance of protest (cf. Caren et al. 2011). A cross-classified random effects model
(CCREM) enables us to estimate the effects of the embeddedness of respondents in survey
periods and birth-cohorts while accounting for age effects (Raudenbush and Bryk 2002; Yang
and Land 2013). As a hierarchical mixed effects model, the model treats age as level-1 fixed
effect and period and cohort as level-2 random effect.3
Second, we conduct logistic regression with data from 1990 and 1996. To do so, we first
test whether the individual-level relationships have changed from 1990 to 1996, using a changing
parameter model (Firebaugh 1997, 42-63). Upon finding no evidence of change in the
relationships, we conduct logistic regression with the pooled data. It should be noted that the
descriptive statistics for the outcome variables adjust for weighting and account for clustering
while the regression analysis uses un-weighted data, as the variables used to construct the
weights are in the regression models (NORC 2013, 2868; Winship and Radbill 1994).
Findings
Changes in the Acceptance of Protest
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for the three outcome variables in 1985, 1990,
1996, and 2006.4 It clearly shows that respondents’ acceptance of protest, across all forms of
protest, notably increased from 1985 to 2006, and provides support for the first hypothesis.5 It
also shows that the less socially disruptive the form of protest is, the more likely that people find
it acceptable. For instance, marches and demonstrations are tolerated much more than a
nationwide strike, but they are tolerated slightly less than public meetings. Still, it is noteworthy
that Americans find marches and demonstrations almost as equally acceptable as public
meetings. Most notably, the acceptance of a nationwide strike increased two-fold over the 21year time period. While only about 1 in 5 respondents accepted this much more disruptive form

7

of protest in 1985, more than 2 in 5 found it acceptable in 2006. In comparison with the data
from 1985, the acceptance of public meetings and demonstrations increased 9 and 26 percent,
respectively.
(Insert Table 1 about here)
To better understand these changes over time, we conduct an age-period-cohort analysis.
As described earlier, this analytic strategy enables us to evaluate the relative impacts of period
and cohort effects on attitudes about protest while accounting for age effects. This strategy
therefore helps us separate out general, societal-level effects affecting all members of a society
from specific, cohort or generation-based effects. Period effects are due to many events and
experiences that virtually all members of the society share. They bring about similar changes for
individuals of all ages (Yang 2008). On the other hand, cohort effects represent the effects of
formative experiences (Ryder 1965) and the subsequent sharing of the same historical and social
events at about the same age (Yang and Land 2013). In other words, they are the effects of
generational experiences. As such, they are not necessarily similar among individuals across
different cohorts. By further examining what drives changes in public opinion about protest over
time, and, especially, by inquiring about factors that shape all societal members (as opposed to
distinct segments of society), we are able to take a more detailed look at what may be evidence
of a “movement society.”
Table 2 shows the results from the hierarchical mixed effects model. The key finding in
the table is the level-2 intercept variance estimates. The variance statistic points to the extent to
which acceptance varies by cohorts or survey periods. In other words, the larger variances in
acceptance are associated with larger differences between periods or cohorts. For public
meetings and demonstrations, the estimates for period are about twice as large as the estimates
for cohort. For a nationwide strike, the difference gets even bigger. In sum, period effects are, for
all types of protest, substantially stronger than cohort effects.
(Insert Table 2 about here)
This does not mean cohort effects do not matter, however. As Figure 1(B) shows, two
birth cohorts (1939-1948 and 1949-1958) are more likely to accept protest than the cohort right
next to them (1959-1968). Still, these cohorts are less likely to accept protest than the latest
cohorts in our sample (1969-1978 and 1979-1988). All in all, the findings point to a broad
societal-level change that is driving changes in public acceptance of protest over time. We reflect
on these findings further in our Conclusion. Lastly, it is worth noting that the relative impact of
cohort effects gets even smaller when it comes to a nationwide strike. This finding provides
further evidence of a meaningful distinction among different forms of protest.
(Insert Figure 1 about here)
Individual-level Patterns of Acceptance
While our analyses so far find notable patterns in the public’s growing acceptance of
protest, we are also interested in individual-level patterns. We turn now to our final research
question: What predicts whether or not members of the public find protest acceptable? Table 3

8

presents the results from the logistic regression of acceptance of protest on socio-demographic
factors and indicators of social and political engagement. Overall, it is noteworthy that the
patterns of acceptance for public meetings and marches and demonstrations are similar.
However, there is a notable difference between these patterns and those for the acceptance of a
nationwide strike.
(Insert Table 3 about here)
As Table 3 shows, socio-demographic variables are found significant for the acceptance
of protest. Age and education have a relationship with the acceptance of public meetings and
marches and demonstrations. Younger and more educated people are more likely to accept
protest than the older and the less educated. Those in school are more likely to accept marches
and demonstrations than those who work full time. The statistical significance of being in school
also supports research finding that college campuses are a protest-friendly environment (Van
Dyke 1998). We also find that parental status and income are marginally significant6. Those
without young children and people with higher income are more likely to accept public meetings
and demonstrations, respectively. Further, whites and men are more likely to accept public
meetings than are racial minorities and women, respectively. Men are more likely to accept
marches and demonstrations than are women. These findings show that the acceptance of protest
does vary by social location, supporting our second hypothesis. In addition, the statistical
significance of the 1996 dummy variable further supports the first hypothesis, showing that the
acceptance of protest has increased over time.
The third hypothesis is not supported in the complete models reported in Table 3, but it is
still noteworthy that social engagement is significant in a partial model (not shown here).7 This
finding suggests that though social engagement has a relationship with the acceptance of protest,
the effect of this variable can be explained by other predictors. As for political engagement, the
analysis finds some evidence supporting the fourth hypothesis. Those who are more interested in
politics are more likely to accept public meetings and marches and demonstrations.
Findings also suggest that the acceptance of a nationwide strike is explained differently
than the acceptance of the other two forms of protest, and therefore provide further evidence of a
meaningful distinction between different forms of protest. Income, which is positively associated
with the acceptance of meetings and demonstrations, is negatively associated with the acceptance
of a nationwide strike. In other words, people with higher incomes are more likely to accept
meetings and demonstrations but are less likely to accept a nationwide strike than are people
with lower incomes. This finding is particularly surprising in light of the positive correlation
between education and income (correlation coefficient r = .32; see Appendix C). Still, it should
also be noted that socio-demographic factors and political engagement are in general found
positively associated with the acceptance of a nationwide strike, as they are with other types of
protest. Age and education still have a significant relationship with the acceptance of a
nationwide strike; party affiliation and political views, in addition to political interests, are also
significant predictors of this outcome, even though they did not significantly predict the
acceptance of meetings and demonstrations.

9

In sum, the regression results provide strong support for the second and fourth hypotheses
and weak support for the third hypothesis. But more importantly, the results reveal some nuances
in the patterns of acceptance across different forms of protest. The acceptance of public meetings
and the acceptance of demonstrations operate relatively similarly, while the acceptance of a
nationwide strike shows a notable difference, as the effect of income is reversed from positive to
negative. We elaborate further on the implications of this and other findings in our discussion.
Discussion and Conclusions
Public opinion is one component of the broader environment in which social movements
operate. Thus, to fully understand social movements, we argue that it is necessary to understand
the public acceptance of protest. Using GSS data from a roughly twenty-year span, we have
found that the public has grown more accepting of protest over time. People are more likely to
approve of meetings and demonstrations than general strikes, but between 1985 and 2006 there is
clear evidence of increasing acceptance of a variety of forms of protest. As scholars have argued
(e.g., Meyer and Tarrow 1998), protest has become a legitimate part of American politics.
The age-period-cohort analysis helps us better understand these changes in the
acceptance of protest in the United States, and adds more depth to our exploration of the
“movement society” thesis. In another recent longitudinal study, albeit one that studies patterns
in protest participation rather than public opinion, Caren et al. (2011) found evidence of cohort
effects in protest participation over time; they therefore suggested that the U.S. has a social
movement “generation” rather than a movement society. We also find substantial generational or
cohort effects on attitudes toward protest. However, our analysis shows that period effects are
stronger than cohort effects for the acceptance of protest, and therefore lends support to the
movement society thesis.
This contrast points to the difference between behaviors and attitudes. It makes sense that
period effects, which speak to societal level influences that affect all or most members of a
society, may have more of an impact on attitudes than on behaviors. For instance, when a social
norm regarding protest or a method of political participation changes, it would still be more
difficult to for the public to change their behavior and participate in protest than to change their
attitudes and accept this relatively new method of political participation. In this sense, our
findings may be compatible with Caren et al.’s (2011). Nevertheless, our findings also imply that
the 1960s might have not been a “short-lived interruption” (Caren et al. 2011: 126) but a
landscape-altering period after which protest increasingly became a standard, accepted feature of
American politics.
Further, we examined how social location, social engagement, and political engagement
help explain the variations in these attitudes among individuals. For the most part, the regression
analysis shows that younger and more educated people are more likely to accept all types of
protest than are older and less educated people. Labor force status and parental status have
effects on some outcome variables. Men are more likely to accept all types of protest than are
women. Such findings go against the concept of a movement society, since they indicate that the

10

acceptance of protest is not widespread across society but instead varies by social location.
Our study failed to find an independent effect of social engagement on the acceptance of
protest. Whereas previous research found that participation in social networks is a consistently
significant predictor of individual participation in social movements (Fernandez and McAdam
1988; McAdam and Paulsen 1993), these findings do not extend to protest acceptance. Of
course, the insignificance could be due to the difference between acceptance of protest (an
attitude) and participation in protest (a behavior). However, the hypothesis on political
engagement is supported. Democrats and people with more liberal views are more likely to
accept a general strike than Republicans and people with more conservative views. People with
more interest in politics are more likely to accept all three forms of protest than people with less
interest in politics. It is notable that political interest is the most consistently significant predictor
among the political engagement variables.
One of the most interesting findings centered on differences in the patterns of support for
various types of protest activities. As we found, the effect of some socio-demographic factors on
the acceptance of protest is contingent upon the nature of protest. Notably, higher income people
are more likely to accept marches and demonstrations than are lower income people, while this
effect is reversed when it comes to a nationwide strike. These findings substantiate a Marxist
perspective on political culture, and are in line with neo-Marxist analyses of various social
phenomena (see Manza and McCarthy 2011). We can interpret these findings in light of the
importance of social location: powerful, higher-status individuals may be more tolerant of less
disruptive acts of protest such as meetings and demonstrations that do not threaten their material
position, but may be less tolerant of general strikes that may hurt them substantially or
symbolically. However, these findings deserve further inquiry, especially in light of findings that
show the complex ways in which power shapes people’s sense of what is in their own interest
(see Gaventa 1980).
More broadly, we believe that our findings help illuminate the concept of a movement
society. First and foremost, our findings show that there are limits to the boundaries of the
movement society. While protest is increasingly acceptable, the analysis shows that not all forms
of protest are equally acceptable in the eyes of the public. Though the acceptance of a nationwide
strike has been dramatically increased, the majority still does not find it acceptable. Further, the
limits of the movement society may be determined by social location: depending on their
position within the society, some members find some forms of protest more acceptable than
others. The concept of a social movement society is therefore more complex than current
treatments would suggest. Yet this should not be surprising: like any society, the movement
society is stratified, with different subgroups occupying positions that shape their perspectives on
societal issues. Our findings about the stratification of acceptance may be useful toward further
development and testing of the concept of the movement society.
Lastly, while we think our findings are useful, we believe that they warrant further
exploration. In particular, we suggest that future research on the public acceptance of protest
employ cross-national data. While the notion of the social movement society is based on the U.S.

11

case, examinations of public acceptance of protest in different countries are worthwhile. A basic
but noteworthy finding in this study is that Americans are less tolerant of the idea of a nationwide strike than they are of less disruptive forms of protest. While this may not be surprising for
respondents in the U.S., it is worth asking whether such attitudes vary by national cultures. The
use of general social surveys in other democracies can tap into this question, making for a good
cross-national comparison with regard to political culture in general and the tolerance of protest
in particular. Such studies will continue to improve our understanding of the political
environments in which social movements operate.
The analysis with the multiply-imputed sample is available as an online supplement at the first author’s
website (http://park460.wixsite.com/spark). The supplement also includes the analyses on each wave of
data.

We acknowledge that disruptiveness may not be the only property that characterizes these three types of
protest; for instance, strikes are usually limited to labor issues, while meetings and marches can cover
broader terrain. Further, we recognize that the meaning of “a nationwide strike” may not be clear to
respondents, and for some respondents the legitimacy of the strike may depend on the particular job sector.
Nonetheless, we argue that it is useful to examine opinions about different types of protest.
3
A cross-classified random effects model (CCREM), in principle, allows one to include more individuallevel variables in the analysis. However, given the small number of survey periods, we lack enough
statistical power to do so. Therefore, with this model, we found it the most appropriate to focus on the
examination of the relative impact of period and cohort effects.
4
Descriptive statistics for the unweighted sample are available upon request. The two sets of results for the
weighted and unweighted samples are very similar and the modal change the adjustment made is an increase
of .002. The biggest difference is a decrease of .015 for the acceptance of a nationwide strike in 2006.
5
A two-sample t test shows that all the mean differences for acceptance of protest in 1985 and 2006 are
statistically significant: the t statistic is 4.3021 (p < .001) for public meetings; 9.0498 (p < .001) for marches
and demonstrations; and 9.5719 (p < .001) for a nationwide strike.
6
The p value for each predictor is .054 and .052. These predictors were significant at a traditional
significance level in an earlier analysis (not shown). For the current analysis, we recoded labor force status
so that “keeping house” and “not working” are collapsed into “not working for pay.” We did so in order to
address a collinearity issue in the data (i.e., sex is an almost perfect predictor of “keeping house” in our data
because 96% of those who responded “keeping house” are women).
