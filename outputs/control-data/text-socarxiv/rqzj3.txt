Abstract
Objective To determine how cohabiting and married couples manage
their incomes across 29 European countries.
Background Pooling all incomes was long seen as the norm in malebreadwinner marriages, but in a time of dual-earner families, cohabitation,
and divorce, the underpinnings of this model are eroding. What consequences does this have for income pooling?
Method We compare ca. 130,000 married and cohabiting couples from
29 European countries in the 2010 European Union Survey of Income and
Living Conditions (EU-SILC) via random effects logit models.
Results We show that cohabiting couples are generally more likely
than married couples to keep at least some income separately, the socalled cohabitation gap. Roughly a fifth of this gap we can attribute to
compositional differences between married and cohabiting couples. Further, the cohabiting group is heterogeneous and smaller when comparing
only couples with children or only couples with a long relationship duration. Lastly, we show that there is substantial variation in the size of the
cohabitation gap across countries. The size of this gap varies with the
country-specific cohabitation rate, divorce rate, and female labor force
participation rate.

Conclusion While there is considerable heterogeneity among cohabiting couples, married and cohabiting couples remain distinct in their
resource-sharing behavior. Income pooling does not become more comparable when cohabitation, marital instability, and women’s economic independence become more widespread in the broader society. Our study
reconciles disparate findings of previous cross-national research on the
cohabitation gap.

Introduction
Cohabitors are more likely than their married counterparts to favor financial arrangements that separate some or all of their resources (Hamplová and Le Bourdais, 2009), reflecting what has been called the “cohabitation–marriage gap”
(Hamplová et al., 2014). Union type is one of the strongest predictors of how
money is organized, but the magnitude of the difference varies cross-nationally
(Hiekel et al., 2014). How much financial practices diverge by union type is
of interest, because couple arrangements for managing money speak to broader
debates on the forces behind the rise in non-marital unions and the changing
meaning of marriage and cohabitation (Cherlin, 2004; Ishizuka, 2018; Zaidi and
Morgan, 2017).
At issue is whether marriage and cohabitation have, at least in some places,
become virtually the same. Studies have addressed the congruence or difference of the two union types on a number of dimensions, such as contraceptive
practice (Sweeney et al., 2015), relationship quality (Soons and Kalmijn, 2009;
Tai et al., 2014), home ownership (Thomas and Mulder, 2016), couple disagreements (Van der Lippe et al., 2014), time allocated to work and home (Bianchi
et al., 2014), mental health (Perelli-Harris and Styrc, 2017), and union stability (Musick and Michelmore, 2018). For 17, largely European countries in the
early 1990’s, however, Heuveline and Timberlake (2004) identified only Swedish
cohabitation as conforming to an ‘indistinguishable from marriage’ ideal type.
Others posit a convergence over time between marriage and cohabitation.
For example, Kiernan’s (2001) four-stage cohabitation trajectory starts with 1)
cohabitation being a deviant phenomenon practiced by a minority of couples, 2)
moves to cohabitation serving as a trial form of marriage, 3) then cohabitation
being a valid alternative to marriage, as evidenced by children being born to
cohabitors, and 4) finally marriage and cohabitation being virtually the same
with children being born and raised in both types of union. The implication is
that cohabitations will become like marriages, that is, committed and enduring
relationships that are accepted as fully normalized. Evolutionary-stage theories
of family change have been criticized for failing to appreciate path-dependent
differences between countries, for assuming a single end point, and for neglecting
the heterogeneity of cohabitations (Thornton, 2005; Zaidi and Morgan, 2017).
2

Nonetheless, important empirical questions are raised by the theoretical clarity and intuitively appealing logic of cohabitation typologies (Heuveline and
Timberlake, 2004; Hiekel et al., 2014; Hiekel and Castro-Martı́n, 2014; Kiernan,
2001; Sassler and Miller, 2017; Sobotka and Toulemon, 2008).
One unanswered question concerns the magnitude of the cohabitation–marriage
gap in income pooling. Given interest in the similarity in union types today,
how much country-to-country variation is there in this gap in the financial arrangements of married and cohabiting couples? Do differences in this gap stem
from the differences between countries in the individual and couple characteristics of their populations? Or, do they reflect contextual differences between
countries that influence the salience of the nature of marriage and cohabitation
and their associated practices of resource pooling and separation?
Drawing on the literature on marriage, cohabitation, and the organization
of money in intimate unions, this study formulates theoretically informed hypotheses to explain country-to-country differences in the cohabitation–marriage
gap. Data come from the European Union Survey of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) 2010. Its question module on ‘intra-household sharing of
resources’ contains nationally representative information on about 130,000 married and cohabiting couples from 29 European countries. The 2010 EU-SILC is
arguably the best available data set to address the cohabitation-marriage gap
cross-nationally.
This study makes three contributions. First, we address the universality
of the cohabitation–marriage gap by exploiting a data source covering more
countries than previously available to researchers. Establishing that cohabitors across countries are more likely than married persons to keep their money
separate, we investigate not just the existence, but also the magnitude of the
cohabitation–marriage gap. Second, testing theoretically motivated hypotheses of the micro-level predictors of couples’ financial practices across European
societies, we evaluate whether country differences in the pooling gap reflect
country differences in population composition. Third, building on theoretical
arguments that both cohabitation and income segregation are mechanisms to
manage risks in partnerships, we test country-level factors argued to predict the
cohabitation–marriage gap in financial arrangements.

Different Partnership Institutions, Different Financial Practices
Marriage and to a lesser degree cohabitation are institutionalized arrangements
with established customs and practices. Their different functions and meanings make them compatible with different ways of organizing money. Several
features of the unions—the risks arising from their divergent purposes, the pro3

tections afforded by social norms and legal regulation, the reliance on a breadwinner–homemaker model—are of particular importance. Depending on the
degree of differentiation between cohabitation and marriage, union type may be
more or less closely coupled with financial arrangements across countries.
From historical and theoretical perspectives, the integration of economic
resources has been a pivotal function for marriage as a social institution. Traditionally, marriage consolidated the wealth, land, and power of spouses and their
extended families (Lauer and Yodanis, 2011). Engels (1902) highlighted the role
of private property in the creation of the modern family, arguing that monogamous marriages were invented to ensure the legitimate inheritance of family
wealth. Today, many scholars implicitly or explicitly assume that husbands and
wives pool their resources to maximize a joint utility function promoting mutual
satisfaction and wellbeing (Becker, 1981; Bennett, 2013; Lersch, 2017).
Although income pooling continues to be associated with formal marriage,
the last half century witnessed a dramatic rise in unmarried cohabitation (Noack
et al., 2014; Sánchez Gassen and Perelli-Harris, 2015), a co-residential union that
has a different logic for organizing and managing financial resources (Brines and
Joyner, 1999; Oppenheimer, 2003). Compared to married persons, unmarried
cohabitors are less likely to pool their resources and more likely to hold money
back from the common pot (Ashby and Burgoyne, 2008; Elizabeth, 2001; Kan
and Laurie, 2014; Lyngstad et al., 2011; Oropesa et al., 2003; Vogler et al.,
2006).
Qualitative distinctions between the institutions of marriage and cohabitation may account for why resources are pooled or partitioned differently in the
two types of unions. Marriages—being bolstered by strong symbolic meaning,
social norms, and legal obligations—embody ideals of commitment and permanence (Treas et al., 2014). Traditionally, marriage assumed highly gendered roles
that promised mutual benefits from male-breadwinner-and-female-homemaker
specialization (Becker, 1981). This model of marriage, however, gives rise to
the wife’s economic dependency on her husband. Women are placed at risk by
gender specialization, not only because women’s wage prospects decline if they
forgo employment, but also because their remarriage chances decrease with age
(Treas, 1993). Despite vulnerabilities, legal marriages enjoy robust normative
and institutional regulation that compels partner performance and fosters union
continuity, as well as providing state protections for a financially dependent partner (Sánchez Gassen and Perelli-Harris, 2015). Thus, marriages invite resource
pooling by creating ‘enforceable trust’ between spouses (Cherlin, 2004).
Whether they are a step toward marriage or an alternative to singlehood
(Rindfuss and VandenHeuvel, 1990), cohabitations are often short-term and
provisional. Focus groups in Australia and nine European countries all describe
cohabitation as accommodating limited commitment, relationship testing, and

4

personal freedom (Perelli-Harris et al., 2014). Lacking many of the institutional
protections of marriage, cohabitations pose greater risks of partner opportunism
and union dissolution. Indeed, cohabitators are more likely than married couples to split up (Liefbroer and Dourleijn, 2006). Whether financial, social, or
psychological, cohabitation’s risks discourage partners from making big personal
investments in the relationship, especially unequal investments that can balance
out only over extended periods of time (Brines and Joyner, 1999). Unmarried
couples favor separate financial arrangements that put fewer personal resources
at risk and are easier to undo if the relationship ends (Lyngstad et al., 2011).
In any case, cohabitors have less need for a common pot. Avoiding a highly
gendered, male-breadwinner-and-female-homemaker marriage, each cohabiting
partner is apt to have own income to sustain independent financial arrangements
(Lyngstad et al., 2011).
Observers point to social changes impacting factors consequential for the
financial organization of resources (Vogler, 2005). Increasingly, cohabiting couples, like married ones, have children (Eickmeyer et al., 2019; Hiekel and CastroMartı́n, 2014). This union investment suggests a more marriage-like commitment by cohabitors and a need to pool resources to support offspring. Meanwhile, marriages are argued to be undergoing a deinstitutionalization, weakening
social expectations for behavior that distinguished them from unmarried unions
(Cherlin, 2004). Across countries, expectations for the breadwinner–homemaker
marriage have certainly diminished (Treas et al., 2014). At the same time, cohabitations have been subject to greater institutionalization; with growing social acceptance and legal regulation, cohabitations are increasingly equated with
marriages (Lyngstad et al., 2011; Treas et al., 2014). These grounds for congruence between the two types of unions underscore the call for considering the
cohabitation–marriage gap in income pooling in terms of both the characteristics of individuals and the country-contexts that give rise to couples’ financial
practices.

Personal Characteristics: Who Pools, Who Separates Resources?
Cohabiting couples are less likely to pool resources and hold money back than
married couples (Hamplová and Le Bourdais, 2009; Heimdal and Houseknecht,
2003; Kan and Laurie, 2014; Knudsen and Wærness, 2009; Vogler et al., 2006).
Cohabitation is selective of people whose circumstances and needs differ from
those attracted by marriage—often with implications for financial arrangements.
For instance, young people favor unmarried cohabitation with its looser expectations, because they appreciate intimacy and shared living expenses, even if
they are not ready for the life-long commitment to one person (Oppenheimer,
5

2003). Being less committed, they are less inclined to pool all money.
Compared to married persons, cohabitors are younger, are less committed to
the relationship, and experience unions of shorter duration (Hiekel et al., 2014).
They are more likely to have been married previously (Hiekel et al., 2014) and
to make equal financial contributions to the cohabiting relationship (Brines and
Joyner, 1999). If only because personal and couple characteristics influence how
money is organized, marriages and cohabitations differ in financial practices.
Consistent with lower relationship commitment, there are fewer union-specific
investments in cohabitations (Poortman and Mills, 2012). Cohabitors are less
likely than their married counterparts to have children although the two types
of unions are converging (Hiekel et al., 2014). Couples with children in the
household, especially own children (Lyngstad et al., 2011; Hiekel et al., 2014),
are more likely to pool income (Lauer and Yodanis, 2011; Treas, 1993; Winkler,
1997). Having children has been found to moderate the relation between union
status and pooling, reducing the marriage–cohabitation gap in parents’ financial
practices (Winkler, 1997).
If only because they do not transfer readily to new relationships (Treas,
1993), ‘sunk costs’ encourage pooling by locking partners into a union and,
thus, minimizing risks of break ups. Indicative of greater investments, longer
union duration promotes pooling (Hamplová et al., 2014; Lersch and Vidal, 2016;
Lyngstad et al., 2011). The shorter duration of cohabitations, however, discourages pooling. Unlike children, union duration does not appear to moderate the
marriage–cohabitation gap (Hamplová et al., 2014).
Although a current marriage encourages pooling, a previous marriage promotes separate financial arrangements (Burgoyne and Morison, 2008; Hamplová
et al., 2014; Hiekel et al., 2014; Kan and Laurie, 2014). Perhaps, prior marriage sensitizes individuals to dissolution risks (Perelli-Harris and Styrc, 2017;
Treas, 1993). Alternatively, it may involve constraints (e.g. children from earlier
unions) on how resources are organized (Lersch and Vidal, 2016).
The joint investment in breadwinner–homemaker specialization—more common in marriage—calls for pooled income that the woman can access. By contrast, women’s independence and individualized relationships are linked to both
cohabiting and keeping resources separate. Women’s employment is associated
with less pooling (Hiekel et al., 2014; Treas, 1993). Separate resources are
reported when the woman’s income is higher than (or similar to) the man’s
(Hamplová and Le Bourdais, 2009; Yodanis and Lauer, 2007a), when her income increases (Lott, 2017), when she works full-time (Lott, 2017), when she is
employed more hours than her partner (Hamplová et al., 2014), and when gender attitudes support women’s employment (Hamplová and Le Bourdais, 2009;
Lauer and Yodanis, 2011).
Demographic characteristics show mixed results. Studies find that being

6

older favors separate resources (Hamplová et al., 2014; Knudsen and Wærness,
2009; Yodanis and Lauer, 2007a), but Lauer and Yodanis (2011) show that
age is negatively linked to keeping some—but not all—money separate. The
association of age and separate money is positive, negative, or nonsignificant
depending on the country examined (Hamplová and Le Bourdais, 2009; Hiekel
et al., 2014). The relation may be nonlinear. Wife’s age is positively associated
with a common bank account in the U.S., but both partners tend to keep separate accounts in old age (Treas, 1993). Male respondents are less likely than
females to report pooling, but also more likely to point to separate management
for both self and partner (Yodanis and Lauer, 2007b). Hamplová and Le Bourdais (2009), however, do not find gender to be significant in three European
countries and the U.S.
Education may be positively related to holding resources back (Hamplová
et al., 2014; Hiekel et al., 2014; Lersch and Vidal, 2016), but some studies report
the opposite (Yodanis and Lauer, 2007a). Joint bank accounts in the U.S. are
linked to the husband’s, not the wife’s, schooling (Treas, 1993). Household
income is unrelated (Hamplová et al., 2014; Lersch and Vidal, 2016), but others
report a positive relationship for family income and pooling (Yodanis and Lauer,
2007a). Among U.S. couples, higher income is significantly associated not only
with joint accounts, but also with separate accounts for both partners (Treas,
1993). In Germany, the wife’s, but not husband’s, income relates positively to
separate arrangements (Lott, 2017).

The Cohabitation–Marriage Gap in Cross-National
Perspective
Research has identified micro-level predictors of income pooling, but results
are mixed on whether country context matters for the cohabitation–marriage
gap in financial arrangements. Hiekel et al. (2014) find that cohabitors are
significantly less likely to pool than married persons in France, Germany, Romania, and Russia, but find no cohabitation gap in Georgia or Bulgaria. The
researchers speculate that contextual differences account for this exceptionalism
where cohabitations are usually short-lived arrangements prior to marriage, and
low incomes do not permit the budget inefficiencies of separate purses.
Some studies find no country differences in the size of the cohabitation gap.
Heimdal and Houseknecht (2003) compare Sweden and the U.S. and find that
cohabiting couples are more likely to keep some or all money separate. Besides
prior divorce, only cohabitation predicts money management in both countries.
However, the cohabitation-marriage gaps are of comparable size, indicating no
contextual influences on how money is handled in the two types of unions. Comparing French and English-speaking Canada—which differ in culture, laws, and
7

cohabitation levels—also reveals no difference in the size of the cohabitation gap
(Hamplová et al., 2014). Nor does the magnitude differ between the American,
Danish, French, and Spanish contexts (Hamplová and Le Bourdais, 2009).
Others report that the size of cohabitation–marriage gap does vary from
country to country (Hiekel et al., 2014; Treas and Widmer, 2000). It does not
depend on welfare regime type (Hamplová and Le Bourdais, 2009; Heimdal and
Houseknecht, 2003), but there is a strong North–South difference in Europe,
perhaps due to cohabitation being high in Nordic countries and low in Southern
European ones (Atkinson and Marlier, 2010). The largest study on the cohabitation–marriage gap so far reports that the cohabitation gap across twenty
industrialized countries is bigger where there is greater gender equality (Pepin,
2018).
Insights on contextual influences also come from research that is restricted
to married couples (Lauer and Yodanis, 2011; Yodanis and Lauer, 2007a,b) or
that does not distinguish between married and cohabiting persons (LudwigMayerhofer et al., 2011; Roman and Vogler, 1999; Treas and Widmer, 2000).
Treas and Widmer (2000) provide an early cross-national indication of cohabitation’s role, as separate money in a marriage was predicted by an earlier experience cohabiting. Separate finances stood out in countries where more people had
past cohabitation experiences and where public opinion supported women working for pay. Elsewhere, studies of married couples identify more institutional
factors. Macro-level predictors of separate resources include ‘individualized alternatives to marriage’ such as non-marital fertility, a male breadwinner culture
indicated by women’s labor force share, and inequality in national income (Lauer
and Yodanis, 2011; Yodanis and Lauer, 2007a,b).

Hypotheses
A high degree of relationship commitment distinguishes marriage from the more
provisional institution of cohabitation and may account, in part, for the willingness of unmarried couples to pool resources. The theorizing on the evolution of
cohabitation, however, posits the convergence of the two union types not only
on commitment, but also on related variables such as union permanence and
childbearing. Given these observations, we propose hypotheses informing the
cohabitation gap in pooling.
At the individual level, we anticipate greater pooling when couples have invested more in their union. That is, there will be more pooling when children
are present in the household and when the union has lasted longer. Because
cohabiting unions are shorter and contain fewer children, we would expect less
pooling than in marriages. Controlling for these relationship investments should,
therefore, reduce any difference in financial arrangements associated with union

8

status. This is our composition hypothesis. Assuming that there is greater
uniformity in investments for marriages than for less fully institutionalized cohabitations, we expect a significant interaction with union status. Specifically,
children and longer unions will contribute to pooling more for cohabitations than
for marriages. This is our heterogeneity hypothesis.
Beyond the personal characteristics of individuals and couples, contextual
features of countries are also expected to predict the cohabitation–marriage gap.
Three contextual factors are especially relevant.
First, we evaluate the cohabitation rate. Following Liefbroer and Dourleijn
(2006), when cohabitors make up a small share of couples, they can be drawn
from one extreme of the population distribution, where there is, say, limited
commitment and more reluctance to invest in the relationship. Strong selective forces favoring separate monies cannot be sustained when cohabitation has
become a ‘normative life event for most population subgroups’ (Kroeger and
Smock, 2014), as is the case in the U.S. and many parts of Europe. Drawn from
a broader population, cohabitors will be more heterogeneous and more like
married persons in financial arrangements and their predictors. Furthermore,
pervasive cohabitation is tied to greater social acceptance and legal institutionalization of non-marital unions (Sánchez Gassen and Perelli-Harris, 2015). If
such stabilizing influences reduce the risks of unmarried cohabitation, they reduce the need for cohabitors to hold money back from the common pool. Thus,
higher cohabitation rates will be associated with a smaller cohabitation gap in
pooling.
Second, as noted above, pooling is desirable and even necessary in traditional
unions founded on male breadwinning and female homemaking. Higher female
labor force participation raises the likelihood that women, regardless of union
status, can look to personal incomes that mitigate risks associated with economic
dependency on a partner. This implies diminished forces of selection in terms
of who chooses to cohabit versus marry. Greater involvement of women in the
economy also implies that married people, like cohabiting ones, will be in a
position to hold back some resources from the common pot. Higher female
labor force participation rates will be associated with a smaller cohabitation gap
in pooling.
Third, we consider divorce rates, which are shown to be closely coupled with
the rise in cohabitation in 15 European countries (Perelli-Harris and Styrc,
2017). Focus groups confirm that Europeans, whatever their own partnership
history, are well aware of the costs of divorce (Perelli-Harris et al., 2014). We
have argued that their higher risk of union dissolution discourages cohabitors
from pooling resources. If higher divorce rates translate to greater uncertainty
about the continuity of marriage, husbands and wives can be expected to behave
more like their cohabiting counterparts—investing fewer resources in a common

9

pot and more in separate purses. This reduces the difference in financial practices based on union status. Thus, a higher divorce rate will be associated with
a smaller cohabitation gap in pooling.

Method and Data
We use data from the European Union Survey of Income and Living Conditions
(EU-SILC) 2010 module on ‘intra-household sharing of resources.’ EU-SILC is
a representative, cross-nationally comparable survey that is used by researchers
and policy makers alike. The European Commission primarily uses the survey
to calculate poverty rates. We enrich our individual- and couple-level data with
country-level data from different sources.
The 2010 data contain information about 150,000 heterosexual couples from
31 European countries, namely the 28 member states of the European Union
as well as Switzerland, Iceland, and Norway. We excluded two countries from
the analysis. Lithuania, a country known for having a low share of cohabitors
(Sánchez Gassen and Perelli-Harris, 2015), did not distinguish between married
and cohabiting couples in its questionnaire. Romania only assessed marital
status for a subsample. Table A1 in the supplementary material shows countryspecific sample sizes and country-level variables.

Measures
The outcome variable of income pooling was measured on the household level
by the question ‘How are the incomes you receive in your household dealt with?’
with responses being ‘all incomes are common resource,’ ‘some incomes are common resource,’ and ‘all incomes are private resource.’ The last category—all
incomes are kept separately—was chosen by only six per cent of respondents.
Therefore, keeping some and keeping all money separate were combined, resulting in a dichotomized variable (not all income pooled =1, else = 0). The
cohabitation gap is expressed as the percent of cohabiting couples keeping at
least some income separate minus the percent of married couples keeping at
least some income separate. Households without income (N = 287) were excluded. Given that income sharing is a household-level item, it may be reported
by either partner or by a third household member. If the reporting person was
not a partner (5% of households), the case was excluded from analysis.
We distinguish between married and unmarried, cohabiting couples. Further, a dummy variable compares couples with own children in the household
with couples without any children under the age of 18 years in the household.
Given the relatively high age of couples in our data, this variable likely underestimates the share of couples with children, as older children have left the
household already. To ameliorate this problem, we control for age in all models.
10

Our measure further cannot distinguish between biological or step-children. Respondents also report the length of cohabitation irrespective of the legal status of
their partnership. This relationship duration was broken into dummy variables
(less than ten years, ten to 19 years, 20 to 29 years, and 30 or more years).
We report employment status of both partners with the five most prevalent
combinations, namely both working full time, male partner working full time
and female not working, male partner working full time and female working
part-time, male partner not working and female partner working, and a residual
category for other options, including neither partner working.
We control for the educational level of the couple. We control for the educational attainment of both partners separately, distinguishing low (up to lower
secondary, ISCED levels 0–2), medium (higher secondary, ISCED 3–4), and high
education (tertiary, ISCED 5–6) (UNESCO, 2006).
For income, we collapsed the after-tax household income, adjusted for household size, into country-specific quantiles.
Lastly, we control for the sex of the respondent who answered the household
questions. Given that the correlation between male and female partners’ ages
is greater than .9, we control only for the male partner’s age, as expressed in a
set of dummy variables.
There are three country-specific variables. Cohabitation rates are calculated
from our data set as the percentage of cohabiting couples per country. Correlating .78 with out-of-wedlock birth rates (Eurostat, 2018, ‘demo find’) for our
countries, our measure is a reasonably valid indicator of cohabitation for the
societies under study. Divorce rates, expressed as the number of divorces per
1,000 marriages in a given year, are drawn from Eurostat (2018, ‘demo ndivind’).
Female labor force participation rates for women aged 15–64 years are also obtained from Eurostat (2018, ‘lfsa argan’).

Analytical strategy
We estimate random coefficient logit models to test our hypotheses. A statistically significant, negative coefficient for marriage signifies the anticipated
cohabitation gap associated with union status. Data comprise individuals clustered in countries, making it necessary to account for this clustering with a
random intercept. We are further interested in cross-national variation in the
cohabitation gap, requiring a random slope for the marital status variable as
well as a covariance between the two random parameters. For replicating the
analyses presented in this manuscript, we provide a Stata do-file on-line here.
The EU-SILC data used for our analyses are publicly available for researchers
accredited by Eurostat.

Results
There is country-to-country variation in the percentage of couples keeping income separate (Figure 1, Panel A). While less than 15 per cent of all couples
keep income separate in Malta, Greece, and Hungary, more than 40 per cent
do so in Iceland, Austria, Finland, and Slovenia. In virtually all 29 countries,
cohabiting couples are more likely than married ones to keep income separate
(Figure 1, Panel B). The size of this marriage–cohabitation gap varies considerably across countries, however. While the percentage point difference between
married and cohabiting couples in keeping income to oneself is not significantly
different from 0 in Croatia, the cohabitation gap equals 55 percentage points in
Switzerland and ranges from 35 to 40 in France, Germany, and Denmark.
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for individual-level variables. Across
all countries, 25 per cent of couples keep some income separate. Only twelve
per cent of all couples cohabit, but the large sample allows us to study comparatively small populations. As relates to the composition and heterogeneity
hypotheses, 42 per cent report a relationship of thirty or more years while
40 per cent have children in the household.
Table 2 reports micro-level findings from the logit models for separate income. Consistent with the cohabitation gap, marital status is a significant predictor of income practices. Considering only union status, married couples are,
indeed, less likely than cohabiting ones to keep income separate. As Model 1
shows, after controlling for respondent’s sex and the man’s age, the odds of
keeping income separate are approximately 68 per cent lower for married than
cohabiting couples (OR = .32, p < .001). Model 2 adds the two indicators
of investment in the union, namely, children in the household and relationship
duration. As expected, both are negatively associated with the odds of keeping income separate. With these controls, the size of the cohabitation gap in
separate income versus pooling changes. The odds for married couples having
separate income are now 62 per cent lower (OR = .38, p < .001). This means
that we find some support for our composition hypothesis, which attributed the
cohabitation gap to compositional differences by union status to the presence
of children and to union duration.
Model 3 adds socioeconomic controls, namely couple work status tapping
female dependence, as well as income, and education. With respect to work status, the reference couples with both partners working full time have predictably
higher odds of keeping income separate than breadwinner–homemaker couples
where the husband works full-time and the woman not at all. The full-time,
dual-career couples also have higher odds of separate income than couples with
neither partner working. We find no significant difference in separate income
practices compared to those with a full-time male breadwinner and a woman
working part time. Nor are there differences when only the woman works.

Compared to women with medium levels of education, both lower- and
higher-educated women have higher odds that income is kept separate; this
equates to 12 per cent higher odds (p < .001) for the lower-educated and
9 per cent odds (p < .001) for the higher-educated, even when controlling for
the education of the male partner. Also couples with lower-educated men are
more likely to keep some income separate (OR = 1.06, p < .05); couples with
higher- and medium-educated male partners are comparable in being more likely
to pool. We find a clear social gradient in household income: For the richest
income quartile, there are more than double the odds of keeping some income
separate (OR = 2.58, p < .001) compared to couples from the lowest quintile.
Taken together, however, socioeconomic factors hardly affect the cohabitation
gap (OR = .36, p < .001).
Models 4 and 5 test our heterogeneity hypothesis. It posits not only that
unions with longer duration or with children in the household will be associated
with a greater likelihood of pooling all resources, but also that the financial
practices of cohabiting couples will be more responsive to these union investments than married couples. Interaction terms testing the hypothesis are indeed
significantly different from zero at conventional levels, indicating that married
couples with children and with longer relationship duration are more likely to
pool their incomes than cohabiting couples in the same situations. This confirms
our heterogeneity hypothesis.
Figure 2 summarizes these results, presenting predicted probability differences based on the models shown in Table 2. Only 23 per cent of married couples
keep income separate compared to 47 per cent of cohabiting couples, yielding
a cohabitation gap of 24 percentage points in Model 1. (The cohabitation gap
without controls for age and respondent sex is of the same size.) Models 2 and 3
reveal a smaller net cohabitation gap in financial practices once composition (in
terms of sex, age, union investments, and socioeconomic circumstances) is taken
into account. The gap is by a fifth smaller—20 percentage points—in Model 2.
Nonetheless, socio-economic factors, including gender specialization in work, do
not narrow the cohabitation gap above and beyond the contributions of age,
sex, children, and union duration (Model 3). Importantly, taking account of
the relationship investments known to distinguish cohabitation from marriage
results in a smaller cohabitation gap in financial practices.
Models 4 and 5 both yield several estimates of the net cohabitation gap.
Couples with children show a cohabitation gap of 14 percentage points, half
of the cohabitation gap of married couples (28 percentage points). Similarly,
relationship duration moderates the size of the cohabitation gap, from more
than 25 percentage points for those who have spent less than ten years to a
roughly ten percentage points gap for those after 30 or more years. This is in
line with the heterogeneity hypothesis, which posits both having children and

Figure 3 presents results for the country-level contextual hypotheses as based
on the full models in Table A3 in the supplementary materials. Given the
importance of heterogeneity among married and cohabiting couples in Figure 2,
we further stratify our analyses by children in the household. Panel A shows
that the higher a country’s cohabitation rate, the greater the cohabitation gap.
In countries with little cohabitation, married and cohabiting couples are more
similar in their financial practices. Where cohabitation is common, the more
likely cohabiting couples are to keep some of their incomes separate. This is true
of cohabitors with children in the household as well as those without. Married
couples’ pooling behavior, however, is only very weakly associated with the
cohabitation rate in a country. Married couples are less likely than cohabitors to
keep money separate, regardless of the prevalence of cohabiting couples around
them. This is not in line with our hypothesis regarding cohabitation rates,
18

which had argued that higher cohabitation rates would translate to a bigger
cohabitation gap. All couples seek more separate arrangements with greater
cohabitation rates, but the influence is visibly greater for the cohabiting.
Panel B of Figure 3 shows the size of the cohabitation gap for couples with
and without children by country-specific divorce rate. We present a quadratic
specification of the divorce rate that provided a better model fit. The greater
the divorce rate, the bigger the cohabitation gap. However, at higher rates
of divorce, the cohabitation gap becomes a bit smaller. This finding does not
support our hypothesis, which had posited that the insecurity of higher marital
instability would lead to a smaller cohabitation gap in income pooling, because
married couples would behave more like cohabiting ones.
Panel C of Figure 3 reveals that female labor force participation does predict
the extent of the cohabitation gap. In countries with higher female labor force
participation, both married and cohabiting couples are more likely to keep income separate, but cohabitations without children are more likely than married
couples to do so when more women work. This does not support the hypothesis that greater female labor force participation would translate to a smaller
cohabitation gap. Across all three panels, it is of note that the pooling behavior
of married couples is less responsive to country-level factors than the pooling
behavior of cohabiting couples.

Robustness checks
We assessed the sensitivity of our findings with several robustness checks, which
all lead to substantively similar conclusions. First, we modeled our outcome
variable with a multinomial random effects logit model, where we distinguish
between couples keeping some or all income separately as opposed to collapsing
both categories (Table A4). Second, we stratified models by respondent sex,
given its significant main effect in the previous models (Table A5). Third, we
restricted the sample to younger respondents only (25–50 years) (Table A6).
Fourth, we replicated analyses with a linear probability model with a random
intercept to assess the extent that unobserved heterogeneity is affecting our
findings (Table A7).

Discussion
Analyzing the income pooling behavior of almost 130,000 couples from 29 European countries confirms that there is a cohabitation–marriage gap, with cohabiting partners being more likely to keep income separate than married ones. First,
we show that some of this gap is due to composition differences, including the
extent to which married and cohabiting couples invest in the union. Cohabiting
couples are less likely to have union investments that make pooling income more
19

likely—children in the household and shorter relationship duration. Second, we
show that there is heterogeneity among cohabiting couples. Cohabiting partners
with characteristics long associated with marriage—children and longer relationships—treat their income more like married couples do. Some gap in income
pooling remains even for relationships of 30 or more years, however, suggesting
that fundamental differences between marriage and cohabitation persist. Third,
we show that the cohabitation–marriage gap in income pooling varies considerably across countries. It is associated with the cohabitation rate, the divorce
rate, and the female labor force employment rate in a country, albeit not in the
direction suggested by theorizing about risk and uncertainty in the two union
types.
Our study reconciles disparate findings of previous research on the cohabitation gap across countries. Previous studies either suggested no country differences (Hamplová and Le Bourdais, 2009; Hamplová et al., 2014; Heimdal and
Houseknecht, 2003) or quite substantial cross-country variation (Hiekel et al.,
2014). Our results show that the latter is true: There is substantial variation in
the size of the cohabitation gap in resource-sharing. However, in line with the
findings of (Hamplová and Le Bourdais, 2009), we also show that the cohabitation gaps in Denmark, France, and Germany are of similar size. Moreover, we
confirm the results of Hiekel et al. (2014), who reported small or non-significant
cohabitation gaps in four central and eastern European countries.
Further, we show that the financial behaviors of cohabiting and married
couples do not become more comparable when cohabitation, marital instability,
and women’s economic independence become more widespread in the broader
society, a novel and key finding for understanding the nature of conjugal unions.
Based on theorizing about the evolution of cohabitation, we had hypothesized
that the cohabitation gap would be smaller under these circumstances because
cohabitors would have fewer incentives to keep incomes separate. Yet, our empirical results showed that the opposite is the case. This is particularly true
among cohabitors without children. Cohabitors with children are more similar
to married couples than those without. Furthermore, for married couples, the
having children in the household does not moderate the effect of the institutional factors on the likelihood of keeping money separate. In other words, the
institutional context is most consequential for childless cohabitors.
We provide two complementary explanations for these findings. First, both
keeping income separate and cohabitation rates could be driven by the same
processes: the cultural importance of individual autonomy and self-fulfillment
(Lesthaeghe, 2014) and more individualized, romantic relationships (Cherlin,
2004; Treas and Widmer, 2000). Both independent money management and
cohabitation are individualized relationship practices and therefore coincide in
institutional contexts where cohabitation is more common and institutional-

20

ized. Resource-pooling is a riskier strategy when male-breadwinner marriage
is less entrenched, when policies facilitate women’s continuous labor market
participation, and relationship instability is greater. These conditions promote
independent money management, particularly among those not protected by
the legal status of marriage.
A second explanation would be the composition of the groups of cohabiting and married couples. As cohabitation becomes more widespread, cohabiting
couples grow more diverse and overlap more with married couples in background
characteristics and relationship commitment. The increasing normalization of
cohabitation means that it encompasses not only couples with limited expectations for the future, but also couples with marriage-like commitments whose
cohabitation is a viable alternative to marriage given broad social acceptance.
Further, the number of couples who have no long-term expectations for the future, but prefer sharing a household to a dating relationship, may also increase
when the social acceptance and practical feasibility of cohabitation are greater.
Such a selection into cohabitation when cohabitation is more widespread helps
explain our finding that childless cohabitors are more likely to keep income separate in contexts of widespread cohabitation, female labor force participation,
and marital instability. At the same time, cohabitation serves as an alternative
to marriage, which is visible in the substantial differences we find between cohabitors with and without children in the household, with the first group more
similar to married couples in financial practices.
When looking at married couples, income pooling is rather constant across
countries and institutional contexts. While the size of the cohabitation gap
varies across contexts, this is mostly due to the financial behavior of cohabiting
couples. This finding is consistent with the idea that the symbolic value of marriage remains strong (Billari and Liefbroer, 2016). The symbolic and normative
value of making a public commitment to a life partner may actually increase
when cohabitation exists as an accepted alternative to marriage, and thereby
foster marital solidarity as well as selection of couples into marriage based on
these properties.
We have to acknowledge several limitations of our study. Given the data at
hand, we lack a dynamic perspective on the cohabitation gap, which would allow
us to distinguish between pre-marital and non-marital cohabitation. Further,
we cannot address the values and attitudes of respondents with our data, but the
rich socio-economic information at our disposal counterbalances this limitation.
Overall, our study makes important contributions to our understanding of
resource-sharing by couples in contexts where marriage and cohabitation exist
side by side. The results reveal substantial cross-national variation in the cohabitation gap and show that this variation reflects differences in population
composition only to a limited extent. We find strong evidence that married

21

and cohabiting couples remain distinct in their resource-sharing behavior, in
that cohabiting couples are less likely to pool incomes. In times when income
inequalities between households are at the center of attention, this inequality
within households sheds light on the current state of the two institutions within
which individuals partner and raise children.

Note: Standard errors in parentheses. Model 7 has convergence problems when including all random slope and covariance terms.
Further inspection of the model has shown that these slopes and covariances are substantively small and we removed them from
the model to facilitate convergence.

Robustness checks
We assessed the sensitivity of our findings with several robustness checks, which
all lead to substantively similar conclusions. First, we modeled our outcome
variable with a multinomial random effects logit model, where we distinguish
between couples keeping some or all income separately as opposed to collapsing
both categories (Table A4). Second, we stratified models by respondent sex,
given its significant main effect in the previous models (Table A5). Third, we
restricted the sample to younger respondents only (25–50 years) (Table A6).
Fourth, we replicated analyses with a linear probability model with a random
intercept to assess the extent that unobserved heterogeneity is affecting our
findings (Table A7).
