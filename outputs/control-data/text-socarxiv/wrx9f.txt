Abstract

7

In order to adaptively solve complex problems or make difficult decisions, people must strategically

8

combine personal information acquired directly from experience (individual learning) and social

9

information acquired from others (social learning). The game of football (soccer) provides extensive

10

real world data with which to quantify this strategic information use. I analyse a 5-year dataset

11

of all games (n=9127, 2012-2017) in five top European leagues to quantify the extent to which a

12

manager’s initial formation is guided by their personal past use or success with that formation, or

13

other managers’ use or success with that formation. I focus on the 4231 formation, the dominant

14

formation during this period. As predicted, a manager’s choice of whether to use 4231 is influenced

15

by both their recent use of 4231 (personal information) and the use of 4231 in the entire population

16

of managers in that division (social information). Against expectations, managers relied more on

17

personal than social information, although this estimate was highly variable across managers and

18

divisions. Finally, there did not appear to be an adaptive tradeoff between social and personal

19

information use, with the relative reliance on each failing to predict managerial success.

Introduction

21

When solving problems or making decisions, people use a combination of personal information

22

acquired directly from the environment (individual learning), and social information acquired by

23

copying others (social learning) (Boyd & Richerson, 1985, 1995; Enquist, Eriksson, & Ghirlanda,

24

2007; Kendal et al., 2018; Laland, 2004; Perreault, Moya, & Boyd, 2012; Rogers, 1988). The

25

strategic combination of individual and social learning is adaptive when decisions or problems are

26

challenging, such as when environments change over time such that social information may become

27

outdated (Boyd & Richerson, 1995; Enquist et al., 2007; Rogers, 1988), or when solutions are

28

causally opaque or multidimensional, such that they cannot be acquired by individual learning

29

alone and require the social learning of accumulated past solutions (Boyd & Richerson, 1985,

30

1995). People show this strategic mix of individual and social learning in the lab (Kameda &

31

Nakanishi, 2003; McElreath et al., 2005; Mesoudi, 2008; Morgan, Rendell, Ehn, Hoppitt, & Laland,

32

2011; Toelch, Bruce, Newson, Richerson, & Reader, 2014; Toelch et al., 2009) and the real world

33

(Beheim, Thigpen, & McElreath, 2014; Miu, Gulley, Laland, & Rendell, 2018) (although sometimes

34

imperfectly (Mesoudi, 2011)). When combined appropriately, individual and social learning can

35

generate cumulative cultural evolution at the population level, where innovations generated via

36

individual learning are preserved and accumulated over generations via social learning (Mesoudi &

37

Thornton, 2018).

38

Beheim, Thigpen & McElreath (2014) provided an innovative demonstration of the strategic use

39

of social and individual learning in the real world. They analysed decades of professional matches

40

of the board game Go to understand the spread of an opening move, the “Fourfour”. This move

41

appeared in 1968 and then increased rapidly in frequency. Beheim et al. showed that Go players’

42

use of Fourfour is predicted by both personal information, i.e. the past use and win rate of Fourfour

43

by that player, and social information, i.e. the past use and win rate of Fourfour in the entire

44

population of Go players. They also showed considerable between-player variation, with some

45

players using predominantly social information (e.g. Lee Sedol), and others using mostly personal

46

information (e.g. Takemiya Masaki, the originator of Fourfour).

47

Here I apply the methods and approach of Beheim et al. to another competitive real world sport,

3

48

football (soccer). Football is enjoyed by millions of people worldwide, and European leagues alone

49

have a revenue of almost €30 billion (Barnard, Boor, Winn, Wood, & Wray, 2019). Football has

50

been subject to historical analyses of tactics (Wilson, 2013b) and increasingly, by providing a wealth

51

of fine-grained quantitative data, statistical analyses (Tamura & Masuda, 2015).

52

The equivalent in a football match to a Go player’s opening move is a manager’s starting formation.

53

This describes how the ten outfield players are initially organised on the pitch. Formations are

54

typically defined by three or four numbers specifying the number of players in each segment of

55

the pitch. For example, 442 comprises four defenders, four midfielders and two attackers. While

56

formations may change during matches in response to player substitutions or other in-game events,

57

all managers select one of a finite and, in practice, relatively small set of starting formations.

58

Formations are a key component of overall tactics. For example, 541 is more defensive than 343.

59

The history of football tactics, crystallised in the use of different formations, is a fascinating case

60

of cultural evolution, involving cumulative change over more than a century driven by numerous

61

innovators from across the world, each modifying what had gone before to achieve success within the

62

tightest of margins. The following is the briefest of narrative histories (for book length treatment,

63

see Wilson (2013b)). After the codification of the sport in Britain in the 19th century, football

64

teams played in something like a 2-3-5, a very attack-heavy formation known as the “pyramid”. In

65

1925 the W-M was developed by the Arsenal manager Herbert Chapman in response to changes in

66

the offside rule. This was 3-2-2-3, which on the pitch looks like a capital W above a capital M. The

67

Italian manager Vittorio Pozzo developed the WW (2-3-2-3) in the 1930s, after which the 4-2-4

68

emerged seemingly independently in Brazil and Hungary in the 1950s. Alf Ramsay in England

69

developed a 433 or 4132 formation, winning the 1966 World Cup in the process. The first ‘modern’

70

formation, the 442, was developed by the Russian Viktor Maslov and later used to great success by

71

Italian managers such as Arrigo Sacchi of AC Milan in the 1980s and 1990s. Concurrently, Rinus

72

Michels and Johan Cruyff brought great success to Ajax, and later Barcelona, with a modern 433.

73

These gave way to the 4231 in the 2000s (Wilson, 2008), which in turn is being replaced (Wilson,

74

2013a). For example, Antonio Conte is credited with introducing a back three to the English

75

Premier League at Chelsea in 2016-17, to great success (Wilson, 2017).

76

Of course, the preceding narrative is highly simplified, and reality contains numerous dead-end
4

77

lineages, failed experiments, ignored co-innovators, and reversions to previously popular formations,

78

just as in any evolutionary process. There were also parallel non-formation-related innovations, from

79

passing to pressing to improved nutrition. But formations have remained a key part of football

80

tactics, so much so that leading football magazines, such as FourFourTwo (Future Publishing, 1994-

81

present), are named after them. Given this, the drivers of changes in formation use is a promising

82

subject of study for cultural evolution research.

83

The key question addressed here is therefore the extent to which managers use personal and social

84

information to decide on their starting formation. This is a challenging decision, as defined above.

85

The success of a formation depends partly on what formation the opposing manager plays, making

86

payoffs of the same formation temporally variable and frequency dependent. Various other factors,

87

from squad strength to luck, determine match outcomes in addition to formation, making the true

88

contribution of the latter difficult to determine. And in the high stakes of football management (the

89

median tenure of English Premier League managers as of August 2019 was 1 year, 158 days), there

90

are limited opportunities to directly trial formations, especially if those trials are unsuccessful.

91

To maintain tractability and comparability to Beheim et al., I examine a manager’s choice of

92

whether to play the 4231 formation or not. 4231 was the dominant formation during the period of

93

study (see Figure 1 and Wilson (2008)): in the top five European domestic leagues from 2012-2017,

94

it was used 37% of the time, more than double the next most common formations (18% for 433

95

and 14% for 442). However, 4231 also showed a clear decline in frequency during this period, from

96

47% in the 2012/13 season to 28% in the 2016/17 season. This decline was more extreme in some

97

leagues than others; for example, the Spanish La Liga saw a decline in 4231 use from 78% to 37%.

98

Here I use a 5-year dataset of all games (n=9127, 2012-2017) in the five top European leagues

99

(English Premier League, German Bundesliga, Spanish La Liga, French Ligue 1 and Italian Serie

100

A) to test the following hypotheses, derived from the above theory and the results of Beheim et al.

101

(2014). All hypotheses and analyses were preregistered before running any analyses on the original

102

data (https://osf.io/er4dx), and all data and code are available at https://github.com/amesoudi/

football.

104

• H1: A manager’s choice of whether to play 4231 is determined by a combination of personal

leagues (right panels). The three most common formations are shown: 4231 (orange), 433 (blue)
and 442 (green). Other less common formations are shown in grey. Frequencies are calculated as
the proportion of all matches in consecutive 30-day bins that started with that formation. ’Days’
are consecutive match days across five seasons from 2012-2017, omitting days on which no matches
were played. EPL = English Premier League

and social information.
• H2: On average, there is greater reliance on social than personal information, as found by
Beheim et al. for Go players.
• H3: There is more variation between managers in both personal and social information use
compared to randomised data.

110

• H4: There is an n-shaped relationship between the ratio of population:personal information

111

use and a manager’s success, indicating that an overreliance on either form of information is

112

less effective than strategically combining the two.

113

Methods

114

Data

115

The original dataset was downloaded from the website Kaggle, originally compiled by Jemilu Mo-

116

hammed from various online sources including whoscored.com, dated 6th July 2017 (version 3)

117

and with licence CC0: Public Domain. There are 9127 games in the dataset, which gives 18254

118

starting formations (two per game, one for each team). The downloaded dataset is available as

119

Supplementary Information.

120

Data was preprocessed to correct inconsistent spelling of manager names (e.g. Arsène Wenger and

121

Arsene Wenger were merged, as were Gus Poyet and Gustavo Poyet), add one missing formation and

122

one missing manager, add season indicators using official season start and end dates, and create

123

predictor variables (see analysis scripts in Supplementary Information for specific preprocessing

124

code).

125

It is important to consider the provenance and accuracy of all large secondary datasets such as

126

this one, especially how the starting formations were coded. Opposing managers in each match

127

officially announce their team lineups simultaneously, typically an hour before match kickoff. While

128

they do not specify their starting formation, it is relatively straightforward to derive the formation

129

from the announced lineup. For example, if four defenders are playing, there must be four at the

7

130

back, giving a 4xxx formation. The dataset used here was compiled from whoscored.com, which

131

in turn obtains its data from sports analysis companies such as Opta, who inform broadcasters,

132

journalists, and professional clubs in recruitment. These companies employ hundreds of analysts

133

who are responsible for coding formations in this way. Given the importance to these companies of

134

providing accurate data, standardised definitions of formations are used which hopefully means that

135

the data used here reliably represents the actual formations used. Nevertheless, bias or error can

136

never be completely avoided in large datasets that ultimately involve some human interpretation,

137

so replication with alternative datasets is encouraged.

138

Predictors

139

Following Beheim et al., predictors were created using a moving time window of X days previous

140

to the formation choice in question. That is, for each formation choice, predictors were calculated

141

from all games played in the previous X days, not including the day on which that formation was

142

played. In the analyses reported below X = 30, and analyses are repeated in the Supplementary

143

Information using X = 20, X = 40 and X = 60 (these choices were preregistered, and generated

144

qualitatively identical results to those presented below for X = 30). The X-day window was reset

145

at the start of each season, so games played in the first X days of each season were not included

146

in the analyses. The Bundesliga, unlike the other leagues, has a mid-season break of more than

147

30 days; this was reduced to 10 days in each season so that all X-day windows yielded prior game

148

data.

149

Personal predictors were (a) personal use of 4231: the proportion of games in the X-day window

150

played by that manager in that division and season in which 4231 was chosen, out of all games

151

played by that manager in that division and season in the X-day window, centred on 0.5; (b)

152

personal 4231 win rate: the proportion of games played with 4231 by that manager in that division

153

and season in the X-day window that were won, centred on the equivalent win rate for games

154

played with a non-4231 formation; (c) the interaction between personal 4231 use and personal 4231

155

win rate; and (d) the interaction between personal 4231 use and the managers’ overall win rate

156

with any formation, with the latter centred on the overall win rate of all managers in that division

157

and season.
8

158

Population predictors were (e) population 4231 use: the proportion of games in the X-day window

159

played in that division and season in which 4231 was chosen, out of all games played in that division

160

and season in the X-day window, centred on 0.5; (f) population 4231 win rate: the proportion of

161

games played with 4231 in that division and season in the X-day window that were won, centred

162

on the equivalent win rate for games played with a non-4231 formation; (g) the interaction between

163

population 4231 use and population 4231 win rate; and (h) the interaction between population

164

4231 use and the managers’ overall win rate with any formation, with the latter centred on the

165

overall win rate of all managers in that division and season.

166

Additional predictors were an indicator variable denoting whether the formation was used home

167

or away, and a measure of team strength which was the proportion of games won by that team in

168

that entire season, centred on the mean win rate of all teams in that division in that season.

169

Analyses

170

Bayesian multi-level regression models were run using the rethinking package (McElreath, 2016,

171

2019). All models contained varying effects for manager and division. The null model contained

172

only the home/away and team strength predictors. The personal model contained home/away,

173

team strength and the four personal information predictors. The population model contained

174

home/away, team strength and the four population information predictors. The full model con-

175

tained home/away, team strength and all eight personal and population variables. In addition to

176

varying intercepts for manager and division, the personal model contained varying slopes for per-

177

sonal information use and win rate, the population model contained varying slopes for population

178

information use and win rate, and the full model had both sets of varying slopes. Full model

179

specifications can be found in the Supplementary Information.

180

Predictions

181

Hypotheses H1-H4 specified in the Introduction were tested statistically via the following predic-

182

tions:

183

H1 predictions: The full regression model with personal (individual) and population (social) pre-

9

184

dictors has better fit to the data than the personal-only model, the population-only model, and the

185

null model with neither personal nor population predictors. Fit is indicated by model comparison

186

using WAIC. Additionally, in the full model, there are effects of (a) personal 4231 use, (b) personal

187

4231 win rate, (c) population 4231 use and (d) population 4231 win rate, and interactions between

188

(e) personal 4231 use and win, and between (f) population 4231 use and win rates. Effects are in-

189

dicated by the parameter estimates’ 89% CI (specifically, 89% percentile interval, see (McElreath,

190

2016)) not including zero in the full model.

191

H2 prediction: The ratio of population:personal use, calculated by dividing the estimate for pop-

192

ulation use in the full model by the estimate for personal use in the full model, is reliably greater

193

than one, as indicated by 89% CIs not overlapping one.

194

H3 predictions: The standard deviation of the varying effects for managers’ (a) personal 4231 use

195

and (b) population 4231 use in the best-supported regression model will be larger than the equiv-

196

alent standard deviations in a model generated with dummy data that has randomised formation

197

and win rates across managers.

198

H4 prediction: In a regression model with manager as unit of analysis which contains the managers’

199

population:personal information use ratio and their personal win rate relative to other managers in

200

that division and season, the win rate is reliably predicted by the square of the population:personal

201

use ratio (i.e. a negative coefficient in a quadratic polynomial).

202

Results

203

H1 predictions: combination of population and personal information use

204

As predicted, the full model containing both personal and population predictors was best supported,

205

containing all of the model weight compared to the personal, population and null models (Table

206

1). However, the WAIC of the personal model came much closer to the full model WAIC than the

207

population or null models.

208

Table 2 shows the parameter estimates for the full model. As predicted, there are effects of personal

209

4231 use, personal 4231 win rate and an interaction between these two predictors. There is also an

effect of population 4231 use. However, there were no reliable effects of population 4231 win rate,

211

nor interactions between personal 4231 use and personal overall win rate, nor interactions between

212

population 4231 use and either population 4231 win rate or personal overall win rate.

Figure 2: (A) The predicted probability of using 4231 as a function of personal 4231 use, assuming
that the 4231 win rate is the same as the non-4231 rate (black line, grey shading showing 89% CI),
assuming that the personal 4231 win rate is 50% higher than the non-4231 win rate (orange line
and shading), and assuming that the personal 4231 win rate is 50% lower than the non-4231 win
rate (blue line and shading). (B) The equivalent predictions for population 4231 use, and +50% or
-50% population 4231 win rates relative to non-4231 population win rates.

213

Figure 2 shows how past personal 4231 use (Figure 2A) and population 4231 use (Figure 2B)

214

increase the probability of 4231 being chosen. The interaction between personal 4231 use and

215

personal 4231 win rate revealed in Table 2 can be seen in Figure 2A: for managers who have seldom

216

used 4231 in recent games, a higher win rate with 4231 increases their likelihood of choosing 4231,

217

and a lower win rate decreases that likelihood. Also consistent with Table 2, Figure 2B reveals

and lower performance lines falling within the average performance CI shading.

220

H2 predictions: ratio of population to personal 4231 use

221

The ratio of population:personal use, as calculated using the full model (see Table 2), had a mean

222

of 0.68 (89% CI[0.24, 1.41]). Contrary to hypothesis H2, this suggests that personal information

223

was more influential than population (i.e. social) information. As indicated by the wide confidence

224

intervals, however, this estimate was highly uncertain, and there was a lot of variation in this ratio

225

across managers and divisions.

226

H3 predictions: variation across managers and divisions

227

Table 3 shows that, as predicted, there was more variation across managers in the effects of both

228

personal 4231 use and population 4231 use compared to randomised data. Also as predicted, there

229

was more variation across divisions in the effect of personal 4231 use compared to randomised data,

230

but not in the effect of population 4231 use.

231

H4 predictions: population to personal use ratio and win rate

232

Contrary to hypothesis H4, there was no n-shaped quadratic relationship between manager win rate

233

and population:personal information use ratio (Table 4 and Figure 3). There was also no reliable

234

linear relationship: as shown in Figure 3, for most use ratios the relationship with win rate is flat.

235

Managers with very high ratios, indicating more reliance on population 4231 use than personal
13

236

4231 use, had higher win rates, but the shaded 89% CIs always included zero, and this increase is

237

likely unduly influenced by the right-most outlier.

Figure 4 shows the variation across the five divisions in the effect of personal 4231 use. Four of

240

the divisions are almost identical. The Italian Serie A, however, shows a much stronger effect of

241

personal information use. This is likely because of the low overall frequency of 4231 in this division,

242

as shown in the Serie A inset in Figure 1. The majority of managers in Serie A never or seldom

243

used 4231 during this period. Out of 67 managers who managed in Serie A, only three used 4231

244

in more than 50% of their games, only ten used it in more than 25% of their games, and 35 never

245

used it. The small number of managers who used 4231 in a majority of their games would have

246

disproportionately influenced the model’s predicted probability of subsequently picking 4231 at

Exploratory analysis: between manager effects

249

Figure 5A shows variation across five successful managers who played over 100 games in our study

250

period: Antonio Conte (78% win rate, 101 games), Josep Guardiola (74% win rate, 124 games),

251

Carlo Ancelotti (73%, 131 games), José Mourinho (59% win rate, 149 games) and Arsene Wenger

252

(59% win rate, 170 games).

253

Figure 5B shows variation across five relatively unsuccessful managers who played over 100 games

254

in our study period: Roberto Donadoni (30% win rate, 161 games), Sam Allardyce (32% win rate,

255

151 games), Alan Pardew (34%, 147 games), Lucas Alcaraz (27% win rate, 107 games) and Mark

256

Hughes (35% win rate, 144 games).

257

While exploratory, we can see in these figures that successful managers seem to be more different

258

to one another in information use strategies than unsuccessful managers. Carlo Ancelotti has

259

less reliance on social information than the other successful managers, while Josep Guardiola has

260

relatively less reliance on personal information. The unsuccessful managers show substantial overlap

261

with one another over a smaller combined area than the successful managers. Whether this pattern

262

is robust, and the reasons for it, are worthy of further study. Perhaps there are more ways to be

263

successful than there are to be unsuccessful in football management.

264

Additional analyses

265

The reviewers and editor raised a couple of concerns about the preregistered models described

266

above. These were addressed by re-running the models with slightly different specifications. Results
16

267

for these re-analyses are presented in the Supplementary Information. Neither re-analysis yielded

268

results that were qualitatively different to those found using the original preregistered analyses

269

presented above, supporting the robustness of these findings.

270

The first concern was that the population predictors (use and win rate of 4231 across the entire

271

league in the X-day period) contained formations used by that same manager for that same team.

272

These formations would have entered into both the personal and population predictors, such that

273

the social information would have also included personal information. The models were there-

274

fore re-run excluding formations used by the same team during the X-day window. That is, for

275

team i, the population predictors are calculated from all formations used in the X-day window

276

except those used by team i. This change had negligible effects on the results, and all conclusions

277

for all hypotheses remain qualitatively identical to the original findings derived from the original

278

preregistered analyses presented above.

279

The second concern was the lack of controls related to the opponent team in a match. First, it

280

seems reasonable to assume that managers might change their formation based on the strength of

281

the opponent, playing more defensive formations against strong teams and attacking formations

282

against weak teams. Second, managers might change their formation in response to the anticipated

283

formation played by the opponent. Because team lineups are announced simultaneously, managers

284

cannot know for sure what formation the opposing manager will play. But they can perhaps guess

285

based on past formations. Specifically related to 4231, managers may attempt to counter 4231 with

286

either the same formation, matching players in the same positions, or with a different formation,

287

in an attempt to break the 4231 domination. To address both these points, the models were re-run

288

including (i) the relative strength of the opponent team, calculated in the same way as the own

289

team strength predictor, and (ii) the formation played by the opponent, coded as 4231 or non-4231.

290

Including these controls had negligible effect on the parameter estimates, and did not qualitatively

291

change conclusions regarding any of the hypotheses compared to the original preregistered analyses

292

presented above.

Discussion

294

Complex decisions often require the strategic combination of personal information acquired via

295

individual learning and population-wide information acquired via social learning, each of which

296

has distinct advantages and disadvantages. Beheim et al. (2014) analysed decades of games of

297

Go to show that professional Go players combine personal and social information when deciding

298

on opening moves, and these individual-level strategic decisions generated long-term evolutionary

299

dynamics. Here, I applied the same methodological approach to the game of football, where the

300

equivalent to an opening Go move is a manager’s choice of starting formation. Consequently, I

301

examined personal and social influences on a manager’s choice of whether to use the most popular

302

4231 formation or not.

303

Over five seasons from 2012-2017 across the five top European leagues, it is indeed the case (sup-

304

porting Hypothesis H1) that a manager’s choice of whether to play 4231 is on average predicted

305

by both their own recent use of 4231 (personal information) and the frequency with which 4231 is

306

recently used in the entire population of managers from the same league (social information), as

307

well as the manager’s personal win rate with 4231.

308

Contrary to the more specific prediction (Hypothesis H2) that managers should rely more on social

309

than personal information, given the difficulty of personally trialling different formations in the

310

high stakes world of football management and previous findings of greater social information use

311

by Beheim et al. (2014), there was if anything more reliance on personal information. This is

312

puzzling not only for the aforementioned reasons (the difficulty of individual learning should favour

313

reliance on social learning, plus the previous findings of Beheim et al.), but also the fact that the

314

population provides much more information overall in the same time period. For the 30-day time

315

window used here, a manager using population-wide information can draw on a mean of 76 games

316

played across the entire division, while personal information only provides data from a mean of

317

3.6 games. The preference for personal information may be evidence for an egocentric bias, with

318

managers weighting their own experience higher than others’ experience. Previous lab experiments

319

have found similar over-reliance on individual learning at the expense of social learning (Efferson,

320

Lalive, Richerson, McElreath, & Lubell, 2008; McElreath et al., 2005; Mesoudi, 2011; Morgan et

18

321

al., 2011; Toelch et al., 2014; Weizsacker, 2010).

322

On the other hand, such estimates of the relative reliance on personal and population information

323

were very uncertain, with confidence intervals so wide as to be consistent with a reliance on either

324

form. This is due to the extensive variation in information use strategy across both managers and

325

divisions, much more than would be expected if decisions were random (Hypothesis H3).

326

However, this variation does not seem to exhibit an adaptive tradeoff (Hypothesis H4). Managers

327

with different ratios of population:personal information use did not vary in their success, contrary to

328

the expectation that an overreliance on either type of information should be detrimental. Perhaps

329

in team sports like football, starting formations do not reliably translate into success in the way that

330

opening moves in Go do, given the many other factors that determine success and the possibility

331

of changing formations during a game.

332

Exploratory analyses showed that one league, Serie A, showed a much stronger effect of personal

333

information than the other leagues. This is likely because of the low overall use of 4231 in this

334

league, with very few managers using this formation; this small number of managers drove the

335

effect, given that if a manager used 4231 previously, they were highly likely to be one of the few

336

managers to use it in the future. This illustrates two points: first, the importance of including

337

league (or any other relevant grouping variable) as a varying effect in the analysis, to account for

338

unusual patterns such as this, and second, the influence of overall trait frequency on the learning

339

strategies that are employed. Rare traits may be influenced more by personal experience, when a

340

manager is unable to draw on the experience of others.

341

In this study I have, following Beheim et al. (2014), framed my hypotheses and findings in terms of

342

social/individual learning. That is, I assume that if past use or past success predicts a manager’s

343

formation choice, this is indicative of that manager learning, either individually or socially, that that

344

formation is effective. However, it is always challenging to use observational data to draw causal

345

inferences regarding social interactions or peer effects (Angrist, 2014; Manski, 2000). Alternative

346

explanations should always be considered, and are difficult to rule out. For example, it is possible

347

that exogenous events such as rule changes might generate concerted change in managers’ formation

348

choices. While this might look like it is caused by the social learning of formation use, adoption

349

might be entirely independent of other managers. As noted in the Introduction, a change in the
19

350

offside rule in the 1920s did indeed lead to the appearance and spread of a new, more defensive

351

formation (although in that case, informal accounts suggest that there was in fact social learning

352

from a single innovator, Herbert Chapman). However, the lack of any significant rule changes

353

during the period of study of the present analysis would appear to rule out an explanation for the

354

current findings in terms of exogenous events.

355

A more plausible alternative is that formation choice is subject to coordination incentives, in a way

356

that perhaps Go opening moves are not. While only one Go player makes an opening move in a

357

game, in a football match both managers select a starting formation. It is therefore possible that

358

a formation might be chosen in response to the choice of the opposing manager. Consequently, all

359

managers might begin the season with contingent strategies (e.g. play 4231 against 4231, otherwise

360

play 433 against weak opponents and 451 against strong opponents), and changes observed during

361

the season are simply different contingent rules being implemented in response to accumulating

362

information about opposing managers’ likelihood of using a particular formation, rather than the

363

learning of new formations or formation effectiveness. While this may indeed be an added con-

364

sideration in football compared to Go, it is unlikely to account for all of the findings presented

365

above. Typically, lineups and the likely formations are announced simultaneously by both man-

366

agers prior to the game. This means that the initial formation choice cannot be a direct response

367

to the other manager’s formation, only to what the manager anticipates the other manager will

368

play. Furthermore, as shown in the Supplementary Information, additional models containing both

369

opponent formation and opponent strength did not qualitatively change the results. Nevertheless,

370

future analyses might more explicitly incorporate these coordination incentives.

371

One reason for the absence of an adaptive tradeoff between personal and social information use,

372

as well as the lower than expected reliance on social information, might be that football is a team

373

sport and, unlike individual sports such as Go, subject to collective action problems. One might

374

expect managers to use formations that fit the players available to them. Managers with access to

375

a Lionel Messi would build their team around such star players. Managers whose strikers are all

376

injured would be forced to use a more defensive formation than they otherwise would. If managers

377

have different players available, then copying the formation of other managers would be less viable

378

compared to a Go player who can easily copy an opening move from another player. Framed in

20

379

this way, it is all the more surprising that there was any signal of social information use at all

380

in the current study. Yet this is consistent with observations of the ‘natural history’ of football

381

formation use. As described in the Introduction, specific managers are frequently identified with

382

specific formations. Antonio Conte brought a back-three to English football with Chelsea, fitting

383

the Chelsea players into such a system rather than adapting his formation to the Chelsea players

384

he had available. Given his success, other managers copied this innovation. Nevertheless, further

385

exploration of how social information use differs across individual and collective sports would be

386

valuable. Other team sports, in which managerial influence is weaker, might not find any social

387

information use signal at all.

388

Future analyses might apply more generative models to data such as this, for example reinforce-

389

ment, memory decay or Bayesian updating models, to more directly model how managers might be

390

updating their beliefs in response to constantly changing personal and social information (McEl-

391

reath et al., 2005; Perreault et al., 2012). This may necessitate different implementations of the

392

time window. Here this was a fixed X-day time window preceding the formation choice. More ad-

393

vanced models might include all previous games in a season/division weighted by recency, or even

394

social network ties amongst managers. For example, several managers in the dataset cite Marcelo

395

Bielsa as a major influence on their tactics (e.g. Mauricio Pochettino, Diego Simeone, Mauricio

396

Pellegrino, Pep Guardiola), many of whom are Bielsa’s former players.

397

In conclusion, this study represents one of several recent attempts to apply theories from the field

398

of cultural evolution to large, real-world datasets that comprise individual-level choices, preferences

399

and decisions that may be influenced by both social and individual learning (Beheim et al., 2014;

400

Brand, Acerbi, & Mesoudi, 2019; Miu et al., 2018; Youngblood, 2019). A closer interplay between

401

real-world data, model-driven theoretical considerations and lab experiments can provide a broader

402

understanding of human cultural adaptation, applicable not just to sports and boardgames but any

403

pursuit where individual and social information can be combined to inform complex decisions.

Results with different predictor time windows

The analyses in the main text use a time window of X = 30 days to calculate all use and win rate
predictors. Here I present results with different time windows: X = 20, X = 40 and X = 60 (NB
these choices, both what to include in the main paper and alternatives to consider here, were all
preregistered).

2.1

Hypothesis H1: combination of population and personal information use

Tables S1-S3 show model comparisons for X=20, X=40 and X=60 day windows respectively, to
compare with Table 1 in the main paper that uses X=30. Across all time windows, the full model
is best supported, receiving all model weight, and the personal model was next best supported.
Tables S4-S6 show the full models for X=20, X=40 and X=60 day windows, to compare with Table
2 in the main paper that uses X=30. Apart from inevitable differences in coefficient values, the
models all have the same patterns of results: for each time window, the same predictors either cross
zero or do not cross zero.

Hypothesis H2: ratio of population to personal 4231 use

For X = 20, the mean population:personal use ratio was 0.92, 89%CI[0.40, 1.63]. For X = 40 it
was 0.68, 89%CI[0.16, 1.41]. For X = 60 it was 0.54, 89%CI[0.05, 1.25]. For all time windows,
therefore, the ratio was not only not greater than one as was predicted, but the CIs are in all cases
so wide that they encompass one. There is, however, a trend towards lower ratios with longer
time windows, indicating that assuming longer time windows leads to greater reliance on personal
information over population information.

2.3

Hypothesis H3: variation across managers and divisions

Tables S7-S9 show that for X = 20, X = 40 and X = 60, as for X = 30, there is more varation
in 4231 personal and population use across managers than randomised data, and more variation
across divisions in personal 4231 use, but not across divisions in population 4231 use.

Revised models excluding own team formations from population
predictors

The following results are from the revised models which, for the population predictors, exclude
formations used by the same team during the X-day window. That is, for team i, the population
predictors are calculated from all formations used in the X-day window except those used by team
i. This ensures a stricter separation between personal and population predictors, as now team i’s
formations are only used in the personal predictors, not the population predictors. This change
had negligible effects on the results, and all conclusions for all hypotheses remain qualitatively
identical to the original findings derived from the original preregistered analyses presented in the
main paper.

3.1

Hypothesis H1: combination of population and personal information use

Table S13 shows almost identical model comparison for the revised models excluding own team
from population predictors, compared to the original model given in the main text. Table S14 also
shows very similar estimates for the full revised model compared to the original.

3.2

Hypothesis H2: ratio of population to personal 4231 use

For the revised model excluding own team from population predictors, the mean population:personal use ratio was 0.79, 89%CI[0.21, 1.48]. Similar to the original model, the mean ratio
is less than one, and the CIs are so wide that they encompass one.

Hypothesis H3: variation across managers and divisions

Table S15 shows that for the revised model excluding own team from population predictors, there
is more varation in 4231 personal and population use across managers than randomised data, and
more variation across divisions in personal 4231 use, but not across divisions in population 4231
use. This is the same as the original model.

Hypothesis H4: population to personal use ratio and win rate

Table S16 shows that there is no quadratic or linear relationship between manager win rate and
population:personal use ratio for the revised model, just as for the original model.

Revised models including additional opponent controls

The following results are for models that are identical to the preregistered original analyses presented in the main paper, but with two additional controls added to all models: (i) the relative
strength of the opponent, calculated in the same way as the own team strength predictor, on the
assumption that managers may alter their formations depending on opponent strength (e.g. play
defensive formations against strong teams and attacking formations against weak teams); and (ii)
the formation played by the opponent, coded as 4231 or non-4231, on the assumption that managers may attempt to counter 4231 with either the same formation, matching players in the same
positions, or with a different formation in an attempt to break the 4231 domination. Including
these controls had negligible effect on the parameter estimates, and did not qualitatively change
conclusions regarding any of the hypotheses.

4.1

Hypothesis H1: combination of population and personal information use

Table S17 shows almost identical model comparison for the revised models including additional
opponent controls, compared to the original model given in the main text. Table S18 also shows
very similar estimates for the full revised model compared to the original. The two additional
control variables both reliably predict a manager’s use of 4231: managers are more likely to use
4231 against stronger opponents, and when opponents use 4231 themselves.

Hypothesis H2: ratio of population to personal 4231 use

For the revised model, the mean population:personal use ratio was -0.53, 89%CI[0.20, 1.32]. The
mean is negative but this is unreliable and due to an extreme negative value. The confidence
intervals, however, are similar to the original model, and widely encompass one indicating no
support for the hypothesis.

4.3

Hypothesis H3: variation across managers and divisions

Table S19 shows that for the revised model with additional opponent controls, there is more varation
in 4231 personal and population use across managers than randomised data, and more variation
across divisions in personal 4231 use, but not across divisions in population 4231 use. This is the
same as the original model.

4.4

Hypothesis H4: population to personal use ratio and win rate

Table S20 shows that there is no quadratic or linear relationship between manager win rate and
population:personal use ratio for the revised model including additional opponent controls, just as
for the original model.
