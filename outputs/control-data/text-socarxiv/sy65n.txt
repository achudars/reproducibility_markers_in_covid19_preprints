Integrating Religiosity into Fraud Triangle Theory: Findings on Malaysian Police
Officers
Abstract
Purpose – This study aims to conduct an empirical analysis of the factors that determine the
occupational fraud behaviour.
Design/methodology/approach – This study utilizes primary data collected by a
questionnaire based survey on 186 police officials of Malaysia including Sabah and Sarawak.
Data is analysed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and cross-sectional regression.
Findings - The results derived in the study showed a statistically significant positive
relationship between three basic variables of the fraud theory – pressure, opportunity, and
rationalization with asset misappropriation. Moreover, this study revealed that religiosity is
statistically significantly and negatively correlated to asset misappropriation. Therefore, the
higher religiosity of an individual correlates with the lower probability involve in asset
misappropriation.
Practical implications - The findings will help Anti-Corruption Commission, Enforcement
Agency of Integrity Commission, Police Department, and relevant agencies from Malaysia
and other countries to design policies for reducing cases of fraudulent behaviour.
Originality/value – This study is an original work based on the primary data collection.
Key words: Fraud; Asset misappropriation; Rationalization; Religiosity; Ethics; Police;
Corruption; Malaysia
1. Introduction
An appropriate handling of fraud is one of the greatest economic burdens. The Association of
Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE, 2016) highlighted the loss of 5% of revenues each year to
fraud in an organization. The total loss caused by the cases in their study exceeded $6.3
billion, with an average loss per case of $2.7 million.
The ACFE classifies fraud into two groups i.e. those who committed fraud in the interests of
an organization and those who perpetrated against an organization (ACFE, 2014). The top
management usually commits this type of fraud for the sake of an organization. Fraudulent
financial reporting is typical in this category to make false reports of better earning, to
increase a company‘s stock price.
Frauds against an organization are known as employee embezzlement or an occupational
fraud. ACFE (2014) defines occupational fraud as “…the use of one’s occupation for
personal enrichment through the deliberate misuse or misapplication of the employing
organization’s resources or assets...”. ACFE then classified occupational frauds into three
major categories — asset misappropriations, corruption, and financial statement fraud. In
asset misappropriation, an employee steals or misuses the organization‘s resources, such as
theft of company‘s cash, false billing schemes, and inflated expense reports. In corruption, an
employee influences a business transaction that violates his or her duty to the employer,
gaining a direct or indirect benefit, such as schemes involving bribery or conflicts of interest,
illegal gratuities, and economic extortion. In financial statement fraud, an employee
intentionally causes a distortion or omission of information in the organization‘s financial
reports, such as recording fictitious revenues, understating reported expenses or artificially
inflating reported assets (Said et al., 2017).

Scholars from diverse domains reported to analyse the reason of people committing fraud.
American criminologist Cressey (1950) as the pioneer, had developed a theory to figure this
out. Over the years, this hypothesis has been known as the ―Fraud Triangle,‖ whose three
assumptions are: 1) an opportunity of the dishonest act, 2) an incentive or pressure to do so
and 3) rationalization of their actions by the fraudsters (Kassem & Higson, 2012).
Many researchers have investigated these factors and reported mixed results (Albrecth,
Albrecht & Albrecth, 2013; Dellaportas, 2013; Slezak, 2013; Rasha Kassem, Andrew Higson,
2012; Zahra, Priem & Rasheed, 2007). Multiple studies argued that corruption, abuse of
power and discipline problems often occur because of the lack of religious values, integrity,
ethical issues and the egoism of the perpetrator (Hamzah, Mustari & Basiron, 2015; Sham &
Yusof, 2015). Furthermore, Islamic religiosity has been highlighted as one of the elements to
prevent a person from committing fraud (Mohamed et al., 2013; Al-Khalifah, 1994; Bernama,
2014).
However, most of these studies focus on the factors contributing to fraud with an emphasis on
the organizations of developed countries. This paper, however, aims to explore the factors
that contribute to asset misappropriation among Malaysian Police officers in particular. This
study selects asset misappropriation schemes because it is the most common type of
occupational fraud which comprising 83% of the reported cases, followed by the corruption,
35.4% and financial statement fraud of less than 10% of the reported cases accordingly
(ACFE, 2016).
The percentage and frequencies of asset misappropriation performed by employees is an
alarming situation. When such practices become the culture in an organization, it causes
lasting damage to the reputation and public perception towards the organization. It is easy to
achieve excellence, but hard to maintain excellence when the organization's image gets
tarnished by the corrupt culture.
There are strong grounds for conducting this study on Malaysian Royal Police. Malaysian
Police Department is one of the enforcement agencies to ensure the success of Government
Transformation Programs (GTP). 'Fighting corruption‘ is one of the programs in GTP in
which everyone should play his or her role to address the problem of corruption in their
organization as well as in the whole Malaysia. However, over the years, the Malaysian
Auditor General Report revealed a string of suspected fraud cases among the police. For
example, in 2012 the Auditor General Report revealed the loss of assets in the department of
Logistic, Bukit Aman Police Headquarter in which 309 units of assets worth millions were
reported missing. This audit finding is a shocking fact on suspected asset misappropriations
happened in a public-sector agency.
2. Literature Review and Hypotheses Development
2.1 The Relationship between Pressures and Asset Misappropriation
Most experts on fraud believe in four types of pressure, (1) Financial, (2) Vices, (3) Workrelated, and (4) other pressures (Said et al., 2017). The most common financial pressures are
greed, personal debt, living beyond one‘s‘ resources, high bills or poor credit, financial loss
and unexpected financial needs. Vice are also linked with financial pressures, for example,
addictions such as gambling, drugs, alcohol and expensive extramarital relationship. Next,

instances of work-related pressures include not enough appreciation for job performance,
disappointment with the job, fear of losing the job, being overlooked for a promotion, and
feeling underpaid. Lastly, examples of the other type of pressures are a spouse insisting for an
improved lifestyle or a desire to deceive the system (Albrecht et al., 2004).
Other studies (Kassem & Higson, 2012) classifies the pressure into, (1) Personal pressure, (2)
Corporate or employment pressure, and (3) External pressure. Personal pressure arises
because of a sudden financial problem, lifestyle, lack of disciplined and greed. Examples of
corporate or employment pressures are unfair treatment, fear of losing jobs, compensation
mechanism of the company, or frustrated with work. Finally, external pressure includes a
threat to business financial stability, ego, image, and reputation.
\
People have an impulse to act fraudulently if they are under severe personal financial
pressure, either through ordinary ―day to day‖ debt or because of some specific issues, such
as gambling. It also could be because of greed that pushes them to take fraudulent steps to
increase their wealth, or they are approached by organized criminals who threaten violence to
them and their families. Further, individuals are the part of such a management teams whose
bonus, pay rise or job retention depends on their ability to show increasing organizational
profits and assets. Revenge also could be a factor, for example, if they perceive themselves to
have wrongly passed over for promotion by their bosses. Further, it is also possible that they
are thrill-seekers only with no intention for money (Turner, 2008). Most researchers agree
that pressure could be a motivation to commit fraud, regarding financial, personal and work
pressures.
ACFE (2014) reported that 44% of fraudsters were living beyond their means and 33% were
experiencing financial difficulties. These results imply that the perpetrators have pressures in
their lives, thus giving them grounds of committing fraud. A study conducted by Dellaportas
(2013) showed this relationship, who interviewed four small groups of male accountants
under custodial sentences for committing fraud. Through the interviews, he found that the
respondents were either influenced by financial pressures such as business failure and failed
investment or non-financial pressures such as anger towards the employer and seek revenge
by stealing company‘s cash.
Another study by Zahra, Priem and Rasheed (2007) also confirmed this relationship, in which
they found that pressures are the fundamental reason for fraudulent activities and there are
several pressures such as society, industry and organizational pressures that can influence a
person and encourage their fraudulent behaviours. Therefore, by adapting the link between
pressures and asset misappropriation, the following hypothesis is proposed to explore its
relationship:
H1: There is a positive relationship between pressures and asset misappropriation.
2.2 The Relationship between Opportunity and Asset Misappropriation
An opportunity arises when employees recognize a chance to commit the fraud without being
detected. This opportunity may surface from several sources, including the poor internal
checks, inadequate training, poor surveillance, lack of prosecution, inefficient anti-fraud
programs, policies, and weak ethical culture. Traditionally, an opportunity has been studied
solely within the context of poor internal controls, in particular concerning to the distribution

of duties, which has gathered wider attention in the recent years (e.g., in Sarbanes-Oxley
section 404 requirements) (Dominey et al., 2010).
Six factors primarily contribute to providing opportunities for individuals to commit fraud in
organizations. It is the system‘s vulnerabilities that create opportunity, lack of controls that
prevent and detect fraudulent behaviour, failure to assess the quality of performance, inability
to punish fraud perpetrators, lack of access to information, ignorance, indifference,
insufficiency and lack of audit trail (Albrecht et al., 2004; Albrecth, Albrecht & Albrecth,
2013). The Committee of Sponsoring Organizations emphasized the use of five determinants
of opportunity, which are: (1) The environmental control, (2) Control Activities, (3) Risk
Evaluation, (4) Information and Communication Systems, (5) Monitoring the System (Root,
2000).
Many researchers argued that opportunity be one of the factors to contribute to fraudulent
activities. For example, in a study by Aziz, Nor and Ahmad (2010), they observed that fraud
such as misappropriation of funds, making false traveling claims, receiving kickbacks from
vendors, misuse of authority on procurement issues and false signatures on cheques,
happened because of the weak monitoring and surveillance from the management. Therefore,
fraudsters get motivated by the weaknesses in the monitoring system, segregation of duties
and presence of opportunities.
Another study by Brucker and Rebele (2010), also endorses the relationship between
opportunity and asset misappropriation. Their study revealed a fraud case committed at a
public authority by the authority‘s chief accounting officer who stole tens of thousands of
dollars in cash over a period of several years. This incidence happened due to the internal
control problems such as the weak authorization control, physical control over cash,
ineffective separation of duties, access to cash and record-keeping. These flaws provide an
opportunity to the chief accounting officer since he has the power to authorize both
transactions and the payment for the transactions.
Furthermore, in a later study, Dellaportas (2013) argued that opportunity have a relationship
with fraudulent activities. He found that the perpetrators used their skills and understanding
of systems to manipulate and bypass control to avoid detection. For example, one of the
perpetrators used his expertise on cheque-clearing protocols to commit cheque-fraud.
Another offender took benefit of carelessly administered internal audit procedures to
transferred money into his bank accounts for seven years. Above mentioned incidences
confirm that weakness in the internal control procedures becomes an opportunity for their
employees to manipulate the system's procedures. Since a weak internal control system may
become an opportunity for the employees to commit fraud, following hypothesis is
developed:
H2: There is a positive relationship between opportunity and asset misappropriation.
2.3 The Relationship between Rationalization and Asset Misappropriation
Rationalization helps the fraudster to hide from the wrongdoing of their deeds. Some of the
common rationalizations are ―the organizations owe me‖, ―I am only borrowing the money‖,
―Nobody will get hurt‖, ―I deserve more‖, ―it‘s for a good purpose‖, ―we‘ll fix the books as
soon as we get over this financial difficulty‖, and ―something has to be sacrificed, either my
integrity or my reputation‖ (Albrecth et al., 2013). Cressey (1950) concluded that most

fraudsters believe themselves as ordinary, honest people caught in a critical situation. This
plea enables to justify the crime in a way that makes it acceptable for themselves
(Dellaportas, 2013). While, Dellaportas (2013) in his study also supported that offenders are
aware of their immodest behaviour, but they rationalized it using three types of denials; (1)
denial of accountability, (2) denial of harm, and (3) denial of victims.
Cressey (1950) explained the importance of a morally acceptable rationalization before
fraudsters indulge into the crime. Because a fraudster does not see himself as a criminal,
therefore he justifies his offenses to himself first. For example, the perpetrator may reconcile
his actions by thinking, ―This is just a loan, and I will pay it back after my next pay check.‖
This rationalization allows the perpetrator to see illegal conduct as acceptable, thus protecting
his self-image as a reliable person. Of course, in fraud, the payback of that ―loan‖ never
happens. Similar to pressure, rationalization is not a readily noticeable characteristic, because
it is highly unlikely to predict someone else's thinking (Dominey et al., 2010).
Previous studies have also suggested a relation in between rationalization and fraudulent
activities. Slezak (2013) conducted a study about theft among employees in New York State
Public Schools. Some employees always convinced themselves with rationalizations with an
opportunity. The majority of employees in their study (57%) engaged in rationalization
committed as many as 18 times. Nearly 70% of them did so for three times or more. The
study exhibited that the respondents collectively used all of the nine rationalization
techniques offered to them; over 46% of them admitted that the abuse of time is acceptable
behaviour.
Dellaportas (2013) also observed that two of the fraudsters rationalized themselves by
claiming their actions as the outcome of poor decisions. Another fraudster pretended to be an
ethical person confronted with gambling addiction. Another three of the fraudster argued the
victimless nature of his crime because losses incurred to the bank are recoverable from
insurance companies. Empirically, these findings imply the justification of fraudulent
behaviour through rationalization. Given this, the pattern of employee rationalization reported
by these studies should serve as a base to develop the following hypothesis:
H3: There is a positive relationship between rationalization and asset
misappropriation.
2.4 The Relationship between Religiosity and Asset Misappropriation
Religion is seen as a real fact of the human experience and believed to be an influential factor
in the development of an individual's personality, and a critical part of life (Salleh, 2012;
Hamzah, Mustari & Basiron, 2015; Sham & Yusof, 2015). Religiousness is defined as
―believing strongly in the existence of a God or Gods.‖ Religiosity may be related to as the
state of one's belief in Allah/God, correlated by his devotion and religious enthusiasm
(Salleh, 2012).
Malaysia is a Muslim majority country. Every man who claims himself as Muslim must have
true belief and trust to the ―Six Pillars of Iman.‖ He must give complete and sincere faith in
Allah as the creator of the universes and as the only one worthy of worship, and one's belief
in his angels, messengers, books, the day of judgment & hereafter, and in fate. They also
need to commit the ―Five Pillars of Islam‖ that is the Shahadah (testimony of Allah as the
only God and Muhammad as the messenger of Allah), prayers (Salat), alms-giving (Zakat),

fasting in Ramadhan (Sawm), and pilgrimage to Mecca (Hajj). Any Muslim that committed
to the ―Six Pillars of Iman,‖ and the ―Five Pillars of Islam‖ will never let themselves from
committing fraud as they are aware that the retaliation in the hereafter would be worse and it
is not the way of a Muslim life. In a simple explanation, an individual who is pious and has a
firm and sound knowledge about their religion would be able to distinguish themselves from
bad behaviours. Thus, he or she will avoid from engaging fraudulent activities because it is
prohibited by the religion (Zawawi, Said & Yusof, 2011; Alam, Said & Hassan, 2015).
Previous studies have conceptualized that religiosity was significantly associated with ethical
or fraudulent behaviour that the higher the religiosity, the lower the fraudulent activities. This
hypothesis has been proved correct in the study of Reidenbach and Robin (1990) in which
they argued that religious variables influence the moral judgment of individuals.
Additionally, they proposed that more religiously committed persons give added weight to
moral absolutes when evaluating situational ethical issues. They also argued that religious
individuals will be better aware of ethical problems, hence, a religious individual will reject
that situation which contradicts with their religious, ethical values.
Al-Khalifah (1994) in his study mentioned that religiosity, in the Islamic context, serves as a
mechanism that shields people from criminal temptation, by putting the concept of law in the
jurisdiction of religion. Committing a crime is a disobey of Allah‘s law, and by being aware
of the certainty and strictness of punishment in the afterlife, criminality is kept to a minimum
among Muslims. Other than that, Islam also provides a unique social control perspective such
as religion, morality, and law, which enable Muslims to exhibit all moral means at various
levels of human life (economic, political and personal) through which they can reach their
goals.
Recent studies also support the relationship between religiosity and fraudulent activities, for
example, Zawawi, Said and Yusof (2011) reported a significant negative correlation between
religiousness and intentional behavioural. The finding indicated that the intention of
fraudulent financial reporting is less likely among religious top-level management. Therefore,
based on above findings, it is hypothesized that:
H4: There is a negative relationship between religiosity and asset misappropriation.
3. Research Methodology
3.1 Data, sample and variable
This study utilized data collected from 186 Royal Malaysian Police Officials of Malaysia
including Sabah and Sarawak, based on a questionnaire survey. The samples were selected
randomly and only considered the Muslim respondents. This questionnaire uses a seven-point
Likert-type rating scale ranging from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree).
Further, to measure asset misappropriation, respondents provided their opinion on ten
different items related to the usual practice of utilizing the office assets and facilities. These
items were adapted with some modification from a previous study by Majid et al. (2010).
After that, to measure the opportunity, respondents provided their opinion on nine parameters
of their work place internal control activities and procedures. A previously published study
(Root, 2000) endorses the use of these nine parameters. The respondents also gave their
opinion on pressures in life, consisting of financial and non-financial pressures inscribed in

ten items of the survey, which are readjusted from a previous study by Kassem and Higson
(2012). The respondents reported their perception or rationalization of actions in performing
their jobs in ten parameters, accustomed from the previous study done by Albrecht et al.
(2004). Ten survey items evaluated the respondent's level of religious belief and practice.
These items were chosen with some modification from the Comprehensive Measure of
Islamic Religiosity used in the previous study done by Al-Khalifah (1994). The complete list
of the items (parameters) used in this study are presented in the appendix.
3.2 Model and statistical test
This study analyses the collected data using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and crosssectional regression. Initially, the standard statistical procedures confirm the validity of data.
Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test checks the adequacy of data; Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S), ShapiroWilk tests and graphical analysis are executed to ensure the normality of data; and the
homoscedasticity of data is examined by F-test and Bartlett Sphericity test. Thereafter,
correlation analysis and variance inflation factor (VIF) are performed to check the
multicollinearity problem. Finally, the reliability of the data is tested by using the Cronbach‘s
alpha test.
4. Finding and Discussion
4.1 Demographic information
Among the respondents, 81% are male (Table 1). Currently, the agency has 113,666
personnel, and only 11.7% of these numbers are women (Bernama, 2014). Approximately
54.8% of the total respondents are in the age group of 20 to 30 years. Majority of the
respondent (63.4%) are married and SPM/MCE/Certificate holder (73.7%). Further, most of
the interviewees (35.5%) hold the job position as a Corporal. As for salary ranges, 54% of the
respondents are within RM1,000- RM3,000 range and only 5.4% are above RM5,000. About
38.7% of the respondents have been working with Royal Malaysian Police Department since
last 11 years. Thus, the survey was conducted among experienced respondents, who have the
adequate understanding of work procedure in their field.

4.2 Correlation analysis
Correlation examines the relationship between two variables in a linear fashion (Coakes et
al., 2008). This analysis helps to identify to what extent one variable is related to another.
Before analysing the model, the correlation analysis examines the relationship between the
variables. For this study, a Pearson Correlation test is used to ascertain the absence of any
multicollinearity problem in the data. Two variables that are highly correlated to each other
and explain the dependent variable, cause a multicollinearity problem if the value of the
coefficient is 0.8 or 0.9, and above (Field, 2000).

Table 2 summarises the results of the bivariate analysis performed to test the correlation
between one variable to another. The statistical results show that the correlation values
among the variables range between -0.20 and 0.60. These values indicate the absence of
multicollinearity problem among the variables since none of the correlation is more than 0.8.
The results also explicate a statistically significant positive relationship between pressure,
opportunity, rationalization with asset misappropriation and a negative correlation between
religiosity and asset misappropriation.
4.3 Regression analysis
The R2 value indicates that 42% of the asset misappropriation can be explained by this model
(Table 3). According to Pallant (2007), there is a possibility of multicollinearity if the VIF

value is above 10, but in this study the range of the VIF values lies in between 1.082 and
1.257, indicating the absence of multicollinearity among the variables.

The regression output implies a statistically significant and positive relationship between
pressure and asset misappropriation. These results further endorses the finding of Zahra,
Priem and Rasheed (2007), in which they stated that there are several pressures such as
society, industry and organizational pressures that can influence managers to commit fraud.
The results obtained also support the study of Dellaportas (2013), who agreed that the
accountants which were serving custodial sentences for committing fraud, were influenced by
financial pressures and non-financial pressures. This study recommends that whenever a
person gets stuck in a non-shareable problem situation, whether the financial or non-financial
problem, he is more prone to commit fraud.
The regression output shows a statistically insignificant positive relationship between
opportunity and asset misappropriation. This result exhibits a similar finding with Brucker
and Rebele (2010), in which chief accounting officer of a public authority stole tens of
thousands of dollars in cash over a period of several years. The offender got such opportunity
because of his authority to approve transactions and its payment both.
The result also supports the study of Dellaportas (2013) who suggested a positive link
between opportunity and fraud; in case of asset misappropriation, he found that a weak
internal control system offers an opportunity to the perpetrators to use their knowledge to
manipulate the systems without being detected. Therefore, it is obvious that a significant
relationship exists between opportunity and asset misappropriation among Royal Malaysian
Police Officials.
The regression output also shows a statistically insignificant positive relationship between
rationalization and asset misappropriation. Previous studies indicate that most of the
fraudsters were aware of their improper behaviour, but they rationalized their fraudulent
conduct. This result confirms the conclusion of the previous study by Dellaportas (2013). He
argued that the fraudsters rationalized themselves by justifying their act either as a poor
decision or considering that their crime was victimless. This study also found the highest
coefficient for rationalization, indicating the highest influences on asset misappropriation
than other four variables.
Finally, the regression output shows statistically insignificant but negative relationship
between religiosity and asset misappropriation. This result has a similar finding with Zawawi,
Said and Yusof (2011) who revealed a significant negative relationship between religiousness
and fraud behaviour. He observed that the intention of fraudulent financial reporting is less

likely among the religious top-level management. This study also ascertains that the higher
religiosity of an individual, the lower probability of him or her to be involved in asset
misappropriation.
4.4 Diagnostic Test
To ensure the normal distribution of data, this study uses Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) and
Shapiro-Wilk tests. In K-S and Shapiro-Wilk test, a significant value (sig < 0.05) indicates a
deviation from normality (Table 4). The result shows all the variables are highly significant,
indicating that the distribution is not normal. However, K-S test and Shapiro-Wilk test have
their limitations with a large population size that is assumed to be a normal distribution
(Pallant, 2007).

Further, a missing normal bell shaped curves in histograms (Figure 1) symbolizes non-normal
distribution of data. However, Vaus (2002) affirmed that for a large population size
(exceeding 100), even with the non-normal distribution of the data, it is reasonable to use
statistics that assume a normal distribution.

Reliability analysis looks at the internal consistency and stability of the measuring
instrument. Cronbach‘s alpha coefficient is commonly used as the internal consistency
indicator. The ideal value of Cronbach‘s alpha coefficient differs among the studies.
Nunnally (1978, p.226) suggests a modest reliability ranging between 0.50 and 0.60 would
suffice for an initial study. Loewenthal (2004) mentions the value of 0.60 could be
acceptable. Hair et al. (2010) mention that the accepted lower limit for Cronbach‘s alpha may
reduce to 0.60 in exploratory research. Pallant (2007) mentions it should be above 0.70. The
results of Cronbach‘s alpha for all of the five variables are more than 0.80, which means all
the items are reliable (Table 5).

Moreover, by using the varimax rotations, an exploratory factor analysis, and principal
components analysis identify the correlation between variables and sampling adequacy. The
factor analysis gives the consistency measures of these variables to estimate opportunity,
pressure, rationalization, religiosity, and asset misappropriation. The factor loadings for most
of the variables are more than 0.60 (Appendix Table). The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin coefficient
for this dataset is more than 0.71 (Table 5) that exceed the recommended value of 0.60
(Tabachnick & Fidell, 2006), justifying the subsequent use of exploratory factor analysis
(Hair et al., 2010). Furthermore, to test the homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variances, the
Bartlett Sphericity test is conducted where the values all five variables are noted to be
statistically significant, supporting the factorability of the correlation matrix (Pallant, 2007).
5. Conclusion
This study aims to explore the cause and effect relationships of four variables namely
pressure, opportunity, rationalization, and religiosity in influencing or preventing asset
misappropriation among Royal Malaysian Police Officials. The results derived here infer a
significant role of pressure, opportunity and rationalization of staff members to commit fraud,
while religiosity acts as a prevention mechanism.
The pressure of life, especially a financial problem when perceived as unshareable leaves an
individual in a desperate situation. Some individual might lose their sanity or judgment, and
to solve their problem they commit fraud. Further, an opportunity also contributes to one‘s
involvement in the fraud as supported by the hypothesis on a positive relationship between
opportunity and asset misappropriation. The findings of this study emphasize on controlling
the activities and operation through designated regulation and procedure to guarantee a lower
fraudulent activity among Royal Malaysian Police Officials. Moreover, the result indicates a
positive relationship between rationalization and fraud.
The results of this study demonstrate the typical characteristics of a fraudster to make serial
of excuses and rationalization for getting rid of the guilt feeling. Furthermore, the result
establishes a negative relationship between religiosity and fraudulent activities. It has been
hypothesized that higher the religiosity of an individual, the lower probability of him or her to
be involved in fraud. Thus, this study concludes that religiosity could be used as a mechanism
of deterring the officials to commit misconduct.
Finally, the findings of this study indicate that some of the police officials have been alleged
to practise misconduct as a norm in their daily role. Although this number is only a small
portion (less than 1%), these people are tarnishing the reputation of the entire enforcement
agency. Hence, the department should implement a more systematic internal control to build
the confidence among the stakeholders and upgrade their level of integrity. They also need to
be equipped with adequate level of religious knowledge to deter them from involving in
fraud. The Division of Religion and Counselling (BAKA) in Royal Malaysian Police
Department could use the findings of this study to establish consistent and continuous

programmes that could enhance the religious knowledge among the officials so that they
could integrate religion as their way of life, especially at the time of performing their
responsibilities as police officials.
There are some limitations of the study, and those might be improved in future studies. This
study uses data only from the Muslim police officials; as a result, the perceptions from other
religious groups may differ. Moreover, this study focuses on the perspective of a police
official as an individual, and taking that aspect, future studies should explore the outcomes
from the organisational perspectives based on a large scale and longer time frame of research.
