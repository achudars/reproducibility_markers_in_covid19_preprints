Energy systems globally are becoming increasingly decentralised; experiencing new types of
loads; incorporating digital or “smart” technologies; and seeing the demand side engage in
new ways. These changes impact on the management and regulation of future energy
systems and question how they will support a socially equitable, acceptable, net-zero
transition. This paper couples a meta-narrative literature review with expert interviews to
explore how socio-technical regimes associated with centralised systems of provision (i.e.
the prevailing paradigm in many countries around the world) differ to those of smart local
energy systems (SLES). Findings show how SLES regimes incorporate niche technologies,
business models and governance structures to enable new forms of localised operation and
optimisation (e.g. automated network management), smarter decision making and planning,
by new actors (e.g. local authorities, other local stakeholders), and engaging users in new
ways. Through this they are expected to deliver on a wide range of outcomes, both within
the SLES boundary and to the wider system. However, there may be trade-offs between
outcomes due to pressures for change originating from competing actors (e.g. landscape vs.
incumbents in the regime); understanding the mapping between different outcomes, SLES
elements and their interconnections will be key to unlocking wider benefits.

1 Introduction
Energy systems around the world are changing in response to global challenges and targets
to limit climate change. They are becoming increasingly reliant on decentralised renewable
or low carbon generation resources, experiencing new types of loads such as electric
vehicles, heat pumps, and storage, incorporating digital or “smart” technologies, and seeing
the demand side engage in new ways [1, 2]. These changes impact on how energy systems
are designed, developed, managed, and regulated. They also raise questions around how
emerging energy system transitions can ensure a socially equitable and just transition [3, 4].
Understanding emerging energy system transitions in terms of the sorts of benefits they may
deliver, the implications on social and technological system elements, and the sociotechnical pathways through which change occurs is essential to ensure that policy makers,
investors and the wider industry are able to plan for, develop, and deliver a net-zero and
socially equitable and acceptable future.
Current practices of energy system planning and management are based on traditional
paradigms of centralised generation and top-down system operation. However, the
increasing prevalence of decentralised generation is driving a shift toward more localised
scales of energy provision and management practices. In the UK this is exemplified by the
ongoing DNO–DSO transition, encouraging more active management on distribution
networks and the provision of ancillary services at increasingly localised levels 1. It is further
illustrated in the upsurge of microgrids around the world, often focussed on delivering
increased reliability, resilience, and security of supply [5], and the increasing interest and
business models and markets around peer-to-peer energy services, which allow end users
to become more active energy system participants [6].
The decentralised nature of renewable energy has also seen the emergence of new types of
stakeholders, including community groups and grassroots organisations, local authorities,
and local enterprise partnerships working alongside private sector businesses [7]. The
diversification from traditional system actors introduces new goals and values around what
local energy systems could (or should) be delivering in addition to traditional energy
services. This includes meeting local social, economic and environmental needs,
contributing to broader environmental challenges, delivering economic growth and
prosperity, creating jobs and providing new skills training [7].
Aligned with these changes is a push toward digitalisation [8-10], exemplified by the
introduction of smart meters, greater prevalence of “Internet of Things” devices in homes
and businesses, and increasing sophistication of automation (e.g., artificial intelligence) used
to provide system services. This “smartness” provided by digitisation is driving exponential
growth in the scale and diversity of data available to system actors, presenting opportunities
and challenges in equal measure [11].
In the UK there has been a plethora of demonstration projects, incorporating both traditional
and emerging energy system actors, to explore the challenges and opportunities associated
with a shift toward low carbon, smart, local energy system development and delivery [12].

Such demonstration projects are critical to support innovation, however most focus on
delivering technology specific learning, paying little attention to the wider societal or policy
context, or contributing intellectually or theoretically to the broader socio-technical transition
that they are helping to deliver [12, 13].
This paper presents findings from a meta-narrative literature review, coupled with interviews
focussed on the conceptualisations of smart local energy systems, and explores the sociotechnical transition emerging through increasing energy system digitalisation and
decentralisation. It aims to assist those planning, implementing or regulating smart local
energy systems understand more precisely how projects are ‘smart’ or ‘local’, what this
means in terms of technological or social change, and how this might contribute to the
delivery of anticipated benefits.
As this paper will show, definitions or descriptions of SLES are not forthcoming in the
literature; these systems are generally discussed without being clearly defined (probably due
to the relative novelty of the precise concept). However, previous work has explored and
defined concepts of “smart energy systems”, e.g. [14-18], and “local energy systems”, e.g.
[19]. This work is drawn on in the current study. While much has also been written about
energy systems in general, and particular concepts relating to energy systems (e.g.
decarbonisation goals, decentralised energy, community energy, energy democracy and
governance, digitalisation and smartness), no work was identified in the current study that
explored how these concepts come together to deliver a SLES. Only by exploring the mental
and more formal theoretical models by which a smart local energy system transition is
conceptualised, can an understanding be formed around how such systems might deliver
intended benefits, how they might need to be governed, and what implications this may have
for energy sector stakeholders.

2 Socio-technical energy transitions
Socio-technical transitions are multi-dimensional processes involving co-evolutionary
interactions between technologies, supply chains, infrastructures, firms, markets, user
practices, cultural meanings, and institutions [20, 21]. Socio-technical transitions in energy
are typically purposive in nature (rather than emerging from opportunistic niche
developments), responding to climate change goals and/or delivering wider technical, social,
economic, environmental and political benefits [22, 23]. Understanding and analysing energy
system transitions therefore requires a broad exploration of these cross-cutting issues,
encompassing both the purpose and process of transition.
The multi-level perspective (MLP) provides a useful framework for considering the multidimensional complexity of changes in socio-technical systems [24-28]. The MLP positions
socio-technical transitions as the outcome of interactions within and between the incumbent
regime, niche-innovations and the exogenous landscape [20, 29]. The landscape refers to
slow changing trends (e.g. demographics, spatial structures, cultural and normative values,
political structures) and shocks (e.g. elections, pandemics) that influence the regime or
facilitate the breakthrough of niche innovations, but over which regime actors have little or no
influence.

Niche innovations, or combinations of multiple innovations, include emerging social and/or
technical innovations that present radically different ways of doing things compared to the
incumbent regime. For example, emerging low carbon energy transitions may incorporate
innovations in distributed renewable energy generation technologies, storage technologies,
demand side management techniques, new business models (e.g. heat as a service,
aggregation), new market arrangements and digital platforms (e.g. peer-to-peer), and new
paradigms for system operation resulting from the use of information and communication
technologies alongside machine learning and artificial intelligence. These niche innovations
may be able to gain traction in particular areas, leading to destabilisation and changes within
patchworks of the prevailing socio-technical regime (see Figure 1).

The current study explores how socio-technical regimes differ from centralised systems of
provision (i.e. the prevailing paradigm in many countries around the world) to decentralised
SLES are conceptualised, both in the literature and by experts. It examines how “smart” and
“local” are understood in the context of energy systems and explores how SLES regimes
might deliver against some underlying purpose (e.g. landscape pressures to reduce carbon
emissions in line with national policy) or drive benefits not realised by incumbent
arrangements.

This study combined a systematic meta-narrative review of conceptualisations of ‘smart’ and
‘local’ in the context of energy systems, with expert interviews from a multidisciplinary group
of researchers, allowing for direct elicitation of these concepts. This section describes the
aims and focus of these two approaches and outlines how findings have been combined.

The meta narrative review is a systematic review approach developed by Greenhalgh and
colleagues [30, 31] to delineate varying and overlapping “storylines” of a given topic by
diverse disciplines and research traditions over time. As a review method, it is suited to

gaining understanding of contested concepts, differing perspectives and conflicting findings.
This meta narrative review follows the RAMESES (Realist And Meta-narrative Evidence
Syntheses: Evolving Standards) publication standards [32] for meta-narrative reviews.

In the initial stages of the review, relevant papers were identified from pilot searches for
literature with usages of key terms such as “smart energy system” and “local energy
system”. Recommendations were also invited from colleagues in the EnergyREV
consortium, of which this study is a part.

Studies were assessed for inclusion based on the following criteria:
● Inclusion of substantive consideration/discussion of the meaning of smart/local in
context of energy systems
● Description of a project or characteristics of energy system projects that are referred
to as being smart/local

A wider systematic search strategy (detailed in the appendix) was developed from this pilot
search and applied in bibliographic databases for academic literature and organisational
websites for grey literature, according to the terms, inclusion/exclusion criteria and sources
outlined below. The search strategy was an iterative process, as understandings of smart,
local, energy systems concepts developed from the literature. Titles and abstracts of the
documents, and, where necessary, full papers, were screened for relevance against the
inclusion/exclusion criteria. Screening was undertaken by two coders and, while blind
double-coding was not employed, the coders conferred extensively early in the process to
ensure that criteria were being interpreted in the same way.

Inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied to titles and abstracts, and full papers obtained
for studies where abstracts suggested they might meet the inclusion criteria. Where title and
abstract were insufficient, full papers were obtained, and inclusion and exclusion criteria reapplied. Those not meeting these criteria were excluded. The search strategy was iterative,
as a wider understanding of these concepts developed from the literature. All studies
meeting the criteria were entered into the EPPI-Centre systematic EPPI-Reviewer software
[33].
Studies were not included in or excluded from the literature review for geographical reasons.
However, as the terminology “smart local energy system” has evolved from a UK
Government funded programme2, our searches naturally identified a significant amount of
UK literature, with much of the remaining evidence coming from countries that use similar
terminology and approaches (predominantly Europe and North America).

In addition to the literature, the review integrated stakeholder views drawn from a parallel
qualitative study investigating how SLES are conceptualised by those researching them.
Expert interviews were conducted with thirteen UK based academics researching a wide
range of topics relevant or related to smart local energy system transition.
Participants were recruited to ensure coverage of social and technical dimensions of energy
system transition (see Table 1). Their geographical areas of research / expertise include UK,
Europe, US, South America, India, Asia, UAE, Africa, Indonesia, Philippines, China, Hong
Kong, and Australia.

Interviews were semi-structured, lasting between 45–60 minutes, and balancing a
standardised set of questions with the flexibility to dive into topics as appropriate. Interviews
were designed to elicit information related to interviewee’s perceptions of SLES. Examples
of questions include:
 What do you think about when you hear the term ‘smart local energy system’?
 How do you draw a boundary around a ‘local’ energy system?
 How is ‘local energy’ different from ‘community energy’?
 What do you mean by ‘smart’?
An interpretive paradigm [34] was adopted to ensure the diversity of interviewee
perspectives were appropriately understood. During each interview the interviewer reflected
back interviewee’s answers, to ensure subsequent coding of the data and analysis was not
overly biased by the interviewer’s personal opinions.
The interviews were transcribed verbatim and uploaded into EPPI reviewer 4 [33] as item
records. Texts were read and re-read by two reviewers to familiarise themselves with the
scripts, and then inductively coded in the same way as the review material.

3.3 Integration and analysis
In the first stage (stage 1), the reviewers familiarised themselves with the texts reading and
rereading the studies taking initial notes that could inform the data extraction or if additional
searches were necessary for differently defined concepts. Included studies (stage 2) were
coded according to descriptive categorisations (e.g., geographical location, keywords, study
aims and line by line coding of statements). In addition to these categorisations, the text was
inductively coded to capture concepts relating to the characteristics and functions that
authors attributed to smart and/or local energy systems (while also recording any explicit
definitions provided) collating into patterns or potential themes (stage 3). As new codes were
added the reviewers re-read the previously coded studies to see if the new code should be
applied elsewhere (stage 4). Text assigned to any code was checked for the consistency of
its interpretation and if any further sub codes were needed (i.e. axial coding in Grounded
theory methodology [35]). When no new themes were added (saturation), the descriptive
coding system was considered complete. In this stage the descriptive codes stay relatively
close to the original texts.
The next phase (stage 5) moves from the descriptions and the ordering of concepts and onto
a more interpretive stage, in which reviewers looked for interpretive constructs and
meanings. The themes were then checked and refined by both reviewers for patterns and
similarities until agreement was reached, and these patterns were grouped and named into
families of related meanings. The thematic structure was derived empirically from the data,
guided by and grounded in prior work on socio-technical energy transitions, primarily through
the lens of the multi-level perspective. The importance of each theme was driven by how
well these themes enlighten understanding of the concepts rather than prevalence. The final
stage (stage 6) is presented in the findings of the themes in the rest of this report.

4 Findings
Fifty-one relevant sources of information were included; 13 interview transcripts (labelled
INT1 to INT13) and 38 sources from the literature review; see references [14-16, 36-68]. A
flow diagram of the review process and results is included in the appendix. Most literature
sources were journal articles (19) or “grey literature” reports published anywhere (13).
Almost all studies were published in the last 10 years, most from a technical perspective (21)
followed by policy (13). Analysis of keywords describing the studies identified topics
including; Energy system management; Energy generation; Energy futures and transitions;
Technologies; Scale and place, and; Study methods including modelling and simulation (see
appendix for further details).
Coding structures were developed separately for the interview transcripts and literature
review. These were then compared and discussed by the reviewers to produce a combined
coding set. This coding was then used to analyse the data and identify the themes emerging
from both the interviews and literature (Figure 2).

Given the purposive nature of energy transitions, this section considers the drivers, functions
and goals of implementing a SLES and explores themes related to the efficiency,
environmental, operational, and societal benefits that smart local energy systems can
deliver.

4.1.1 More effective and efficient

This includes the ability of the system to deliver energy services to users in more effective
and efficient ways:
“…energy, like money, is an intermediary good in the economy, it serves no purpose
whatsoever other than what we can do with it, so an energy system could be defined
purely in terms of the services that that energy system is able to provide.” INT10
A more effective energy system could be achieved through integration across energy vectors
[51] and across “the actions of all users connected to it” [69] in order to deliver more
economic energy services. Leveraging smart technology to enable this flexibility was seen
as a key aspect of compensating for large quantities of fluctuating renewable energy
resources, helping to improve and optimise energy delivery performance, increase system
efficiency, minimise energy delivery costs and system costs, and maximise value to
stakeholders [14] [15] [44] [67].
However, one interviewee reflected on the need to consider services beyond energy, and
the emerging value of data services as energy systems become “smarter”:
“What happens when the value of electricity as a data vector approaches or exceeds
its value as an energy vector … then data can start to create new, consumer value
propositions … if you get large data companies, effectively, cross-subsidising energy
because of the profit margin on data, then that could start to drive very curious forms

9

of energy behaviour which are not rational, purely from a perspective of how energy
should be used.” INT10

A key driving element for energy system transition is in the delivery of a low (or zero) carbon
economy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions associated with the energy system through
the use of renewable generation sources, and reducing environment impacts to a level
“within its assimilative capacity” [44, 49, 70].

19

4.1.3 Improves operational resilience

This concept was mentioned by interviewees; a SLES should be resilient and “able to cope
with failure” for instance through alternative grid connections if renewable generation and
storage had both stopped (INT9). This could be facilitated using real-time data to enhanced
decision making or provide autonomous control.

31

4.1.4 Drives social justice and energy equity

32

42
43

By engaging local and community actors in new ways, more local provision of energy
systems and services offer the potential to deliver greater energy equity and benefits to the
local community. There was recognition that smart local energy systems could help by
making energy more affordable, reducing energy bills, improving comfort and quality of life
[43, 47]. It could also open up energy product choices and opportunities to consumers to
participate in market [67], and deliver a fairer energy system [43].

Interviewees also noted that energy systems interact with wider environmental ecosystems,
and that environmental impacts are not limited to greenhouse gas emissions. They noted
that other factors, such as land use for renewables rather than food production, are rarely
considered despite potentially larger impacts, and outlined the potential for renewable
energy to deliver benefits:
“Transition to renewable energy … also provides opportunities to embed positive,
environmental impact, so instead of just avoiding the bad, can we do it in a way that
provides environmental, energy, economic win-win?” INT12

“a local energy system might provide better security against grid outages … [with]
some local and automated intelligence that could manage a system disconnected.”
INT5
This could also improve security of supply [44] and reliability [42, 71], and reduce financially
expensive system failures [54] in the wider system.

However, there was recognition that this would be dependent on the way in which smart
local energy systems are designed and delivered, and on the stakeholders they engage.
There were also concerns that the trust and empowerment implied by the term ‘local’ may be
presumptive [39] and that who benefits from local energy systems may not be obvious. For
instance, one interviewee described an energy company owned by a local authority but with

10

1

customers nationwide, meaning that the “local authority gets very slightly richer at the
expense of other local authorities” (INT1), creating the potential for “winners” and “losers”
between localities or communities across the country. As one participant outlined:

8

4.1.5 Supports local priorities and needs

“it’s not only optimising things locally, but it’s also achieving good outcomes across
the range of economic, social, environmental outcomes at a system-wide or national
scale”. INT8

10
11
12
13

15

Some interviewees described a SLES as able to “serve a particular community.” (INT1),
accounting for local and contextual priorities to meet locally specific needs. These may be:
● practical, e.g. convenient for locals to access and take part in the system [39],
● for the community, e.g. achieving benefits for vulnerable locals, boosting local
employment and growth [40], or
● wider, value-based needs, e.g. addressing a local desire to reduce global
environmental impacts [41].

16

4.2 Emerging smart local energy regimes

17
18

20
21
22

The interviews and literature provided insights into how “smart” and “local” niche elements of
energy systems might manifest within pockets of emerging SLES regimes to deliver the
range of potential benefits explored in Section 4.1. Common themes across the literature
and interviews were identified related to operational shifts (i.e. how the energy system is
operated), integration of digital technologies, how users are supported, and what institutional
arrangements might look like.

23

4.2.1 System operation

24
25
26
27

A key defining factor of SLES regimes stems from new ways in which energy systems are
managed within local boundaries. The main concepts emerging related to the ability and
degree of local balancing within the SLES, as well as the way in which this balancing
incorporated multiple energy vectors.

28

Local balancing of supply and demand was discussed as a key function of SLES to
“minimize the amount of energy absorbed by the grid, maximizing the local use of energy
produced by renewable sources” [59].
There was general agreement that an energy system covers everything from “production,
conversion, transmission, distribution, and consumption” [36]. This was considered true for
smaller, local, scales, even down to single building energy systems where typical
components of such a system include local generation, grid connection, storage devices and
customer demand. Most interviewees expressed similar views, describing energy systems
as “generation and consumption and the infrastructure that interconnects and manages
those” (INT9) and “generation or conversion through the way to demand and use and every
step along the chain” (INT12).

In addition to local balancing, interviewees discussed smart energy systems as including
“integration between those different service areas around transport and heating and
electricity” (INT8) and “the capacity to switch between different energy vectors” (INT10),
enabling balancing across vectors rather than just within a single vector.

“In order for it to be a [local energy] system, it has to use whatever it generates” INT9
However, another interviewee expressed scepticism about this concept, especially when
considering energy systems “from cradle to grave”, given their range of inputs and
interactions:
“I don’t think it applies to local energy systems because I imagine not many energy
systems are, in fact, particularly local in terms of the resources put into it.” INT12
Thus, while local balancing is considered a key element of smart local energy systems, there
was less clarity on the degree to which the SLES are independent from the wider grid. A
completely independent SLES may be less resilient and less able to cope with failure than
one which interacts with the wider energy system, contrasting with some of the potential
benefits SLES are anticipated to deliver. This is also likely to be context specific, as some
areas may be generation rich (and therefore never able to consume all that is produced)
while others, such as city centres, are likely to be generation poor. This also raises questions
over timescales – do supply and demand need to be balanced within the locality at the
micro-second level or across the year? Fully balancing supply and demand within a SLES
across all points in time may prove highly costly due to reduced supply and demand diversity
requiring greater levels of storage. Therefore, to ensure the SLES can deliver the wide range
of benefits outlined in Section 4.1, it is more likely that local balancing is employed to
maximise the use of local resources, while not adding costs or constraints due to
requirements for complete independence.

The general consensus among interviewees is that an energy system incorporates more
than one energy vector, and the concept of a “smart” in this context mean optimising the
delivering of energy services across energy vectors (electricity, heat and transport) rather
than treating them separately:
“I think the intelligences of smart comes from looking across energy broadly, that
you’re not just trying to make best use of electricity in this box and make the best use
of gas in that box and you are looking to play across the vectors”. INT5
Hvelplund [38] described proposed scenarios for transitioning to renewable energy systems
in Denmark, stating that:
“...the smart energy system integration is crucial. The scenarios rely on a holistic
smart energy system including the use of: heat storages and district heating with

12

CHP plants and large heat pumps, new electricity demands from large heat pumps
and electric vehicles as storage options, electrolysers and liquid fuel for the transport
sector, enabling storage as liquids as well as the use of gas storage.” (pg 18)

Hargreaves et al. [43] also highlight this integration, describing electricity smart grids as
“multi-dimensional, linking it to gas and other sources of thermal energy, such as heat from
industrial processes and buildings, electrified and hybrid transport systems.”

Fundamental to delivering more local and flexible operating paradigms that characterise
SLES regimes, are underpinning “smart” technologies driving “digitization, informatization,
automation, interaction, intellectualization, accurate measurement, extensive
communication, autonomous control and wide compatibility” [16]. Consequently, a smart
energy system can be thought of as “a networked and embedded platform for realizing a
dynamic energy mix and optimizing the energy consumption dynamically” [72]. The following
sections consider how the integration of niche technologies – including information and
communication technologies and automation and self regelation – into the energy system
characterises the operation of SLES regimes.

The integration of niche information and communication technologies into traditional energy
systems enables data to be gathered and used to optimise the system in smarter (and
potentially more local) ways, and provide greater flexibility and security. Alamaniotis [55]
describes this integrated system as “the coupling of distribution grid with information and
processing technologies for management of power generation, transmission and delivery”,
driven by data on energy quantities, costs and characteristics. The same ideas re-occur
when elements and enablers of smart energy systems are discussed:
● “A smart system ... more driven by data and communication technologies” [17]
● “information fusion ... a reconstruction of the energy system with the information
system” [16]
● “Energy internet … information networks interact with power generation,
transmission, and distribution systems aiming at optimizing power system operation.”
[54]
● “a smart city ... ICT applied to critical infrastructure components and services” [42]

“an approach in which smart electricity, thermal and gas grids are combined with
storage technologies and coordinated to identify synergies between them in order to
achieve an optimal solution for each individual sector as well as for the overall energy
system”, [51].

Interviewees expressed similar thoughts, describing “an information data driven system”
INT3, which is “... smart because it generates and consumes, within itself, data in real or
near real time, to perform its complex function optimally- by some criteria..” INT1. They
noted it includes “digital platforms for synthesising and assimilating data across a number of
local energy vectors” INT4, or “an ICT layer … that allows us to respond to the changing
conditions in the local energy system – and that’s the smartness” INT10. One interviewee

also mentioned that the smartness came from “... collecting digital information from them and
you have some ability to influence it [the energy system], based on that data.” INT6

While there was generally consensus around smartness relying on the generation and use of
data derived from the integration of “smart” technologies into energy systems, a broader
discussion emerged around the location of that smartness. Many interviewees articulated
that wider aspects beyond the purely technical were an integral part of a smart energy
system:

This last viewpoint reflects a common perspective in the literature, that a smarter energy
system means capturing data in order to inform services and better operate the system [42]:
“Smart Energy is the application of real-time bi-directional communication of
information to ensure the intelligent distribution of supply & demand in the energy
network” [16]
Two-way communication is noted as a feature that characterises smart energy, and smart
grids in particular, [38, 62], while various authors highlight the need for additional metering
[41] and engagement to obtain feedback [63].

“...there’s a degree of autonomy ... the system responds to its environment in that it
tries to balance supply and demand, whereas a non-smart system simply doesn’t”
INT10
“...the [smart] system automatically controls itself to provide the services that are
needed, so you’re using technology to make the decisions.” INT13
This fits closely with Ofgem’s definition of smart as “something enabled by new technology”
particularly where this “enables automatic control” [69], and descriptions of specific smart
energy systems that include autonomous control elements, e.g. [37], used to optimise the
operation of the system. This dynamic control also provides greater capacity to respond
flexibly to (and therefore cope with) failure with individual elements of the system.

“you can also get the human aspect of it and what people want to do and why the
empowerment of practices that they need to follow …so it’s kind of a combination of
two things, the technical and the human aspect”, INT9

In this new operating paradigm, energy systems are autonomously controlled in real time,
informed by data collected from both network monitoring and users themselves, who provide
information on their preferences that are developed into user profiles [37].

effective decision-making, planning, and governance processes.

Across the literature and interviews it was clear that institutional infrastructure was
considered a key part of the energy system:

For one interviewee, a similar capability was manifest in peer-to-peer transactive energy
marketplaces, where the smartness was due to the system being able to optimise against
user preferences through minimal input, leveraging self-learning.
“...the minimum thing is providing that ‘I want to buy solar power, I want to sell to my
neighbours... so what are my preferences?’ and set once and used continuously to
learn … in such a way that it optimises my own preferences.” INT9
This perspective couples people with technology in defining the smartness, with users
setting parameters, and technology learning and adapting based on revealed preferences.

“it’s about information that’s providing an awareness of consequences of decisions …
so the smartness comes from decision making by people that’s informed by richer
data and can take more factors into account.” INT5
There was also agreement that the “smart” technology and any use of automation shouldn’t
make users feel stupid, but instead empower them through greater control and choice,
helping them “access the benefits of a smart system in whatever way works for them” [17].
This would enable individuals to make more informed decisions and ensure that the energy
services they receive are tailored to their priorities and needs.

“also includes the market structures, the regulation, the rules, the industry codes, it’s
all of those things that make that system work, along with the infrastructure, so it’s all
of that, in there because everything that happens within that system has got
dependencies on all of those things and of course the consumers.” INT1
“political, economic, social and technological dimensions are included in the energy
chain. If the aim was only to deal with the technology of the energy chain, the word
“energy infrastructure” would be a more accurate expression” [36]

15

This section thus considers how institutional elements, including governance structures,
ownership models, and stakeholders, might be arranged in new ways within smart local
energy systems.

Decision making at a local level is likely to affect how favourable conditions are for local
energy systems. As Ofgem note:

Alongside new local forms of governance, a degree of control of local energy systems can
be maintained through local ownership of assets. One interviewee stated that:

“The prevalence of local [energy] in a country depends on that state’s administrative,
policy, governance and market arrangements.” [19]
This can vary from one local authority to the next, though relationships between authorities
can sometimes be forged due to shared energy needs (INT4). As the energy system
transforms towards a more localised approach, such institutional and decision making
infrastructure is likely to change with it.
“… to get a really SLES, they [decision makers] probably need to be interacting with
other entities locally, whether it’s the local council, whether it’s community groups….”
INT8
Recent recommendations from IGov describe a situation where:
“Distribution Service Providers (DSPs) would replace DNOs, to become coordinators
of local energy systems, market facilitators and balancers. DSPs would implement
the shift from the linear, top-down value chain of the energy system to one which
places customers at its focus and values efficiency, flexibility and sustainability.” [73]

“… you would expect there to be local ownership of demand assets … of generation
assets … of storage” and, “,[ownership and investment] at the systems level … in a
minority of cases.” (INT10).
Such arrangements can help to foster engagement and enable profits to be kept within
communities rather than channelled elsewhere by private companies as is often feared [40].
Alanne and Saari [36] also noted that although the common expectation is that “energy
conversion technology should be owned by energy utilities, because they have expertise and
other resources” to maintain and operate it, decentralising these functions would require the
creation of new jobs and so boost the local economy. Presently though, local ownership is
by no means a requirement of a local energy system; Devine-Wright and Wiersma [39] found
that many decentralised energy projects they studied had sourced funds from elsewhere in
the country and beyond.

Several interviewees discussed the role of communities and other local stakeholders in
smart local energy systems. One participant described a recent policy shift from community
towards local energy, highlighting key differences in terms the actors involved and the
distribution of benefits:

27

4.3 Regime boundaries

28
29
30
31

When considering how boundaries are drawn around local energy systems, the concept of
local may seem “self-evident” [39] but closer examination reveals inconsistencies and
different perspectives. The ever-present, perhaps indisputable, factor is some form of spatial
description or boundary.

32

4.3.1 By geography

33
34
35
36
37
38
39
40
41
42
43

One of the most common ways in which local was discussed was based around physical,
map-based geography. Interviewees talked of putting a “circle around the evidence” to
pinpoint the energy system (INT7), and the need for geographic boundaries (INT8, INT9),
even if these might vary dependent on context. This was reflected in the literature by the use
of similar terminology, e.g. “within a common geographical area” [19].

“…local energy is… a slightly less radical version where local authorities are at the
centre of managing and driving energy systems, maybe in partnership with private
sector actors and civil society, but it places much more of a focal point role on
existing institutions – public sector institutions, like councils – whereas community
energy was much more about civic, grass roots organisations and citizens coming
together and forming new kinds of organisations, with lots of assumptions around the
sharing of benefits…” INT11
Other participants highlighted that local energy, unlike community energy, was
geographically constrained, rather than focusing on communities of ‘interest’ or ‘practice’:
“…local implies a locality. Community implies a group that identify with it…” INT13
However, this does not preclude communities from engaging with local energy systems;
localisation, with local authorities at the focal point, can make it easier for citizens and
communities to interact, engage, and participate, delivering increased transparency and
efficiency (in the energy system) and ultimately improving their neighbourhoods [74, 75].
Thus, a key element of local energy systems is the involvement of local stakeholders,
including local citizens and communities, typically via the local authority [7].

This focus on geographic demarcation of the SLES boundary makes this type of energy
system transition distinct from others also emerging due to the rise in decentralised
renewable generation. An example, highlighted in the interviews, compares SLES
development to the renewable transition seen in Germany:

17

“…the German renewable energy sector has taken off because of citizen funding and
share offers and that’s not been at a local basis at all, it’s been people investing in
wind energy or solar energy projects from all over the country...” INT5

1

3

However, there are a number of ways in which this geographically defined boundary around
a SLES regime can be considered, as outlined in the following sections.

7

4.3.2 By generation resources

8
9
10
11
12
13
14
15
16
17

Proximity to energy generation can “enable a sense of connection” in customers, even
where the supply is not directly or exclusively connected to the demand [76]. More
commonly though, where supply is located close to demand to take advantage of the close
physical connection. Local in these cases refers to “production where it is needed” [64] or
‘decentralised energy’ where energy is generated close to demand [36]. This can involve
building a local energy system around a single nucleus e.g. “a large solar farm… a farm
waste digester that gives you a source of gas or… an industrial process that gives you a
source of waste heat” (INT5) or a network of multiple energy sources (e.g. solar panels on
the homes of ‘prosumers’). Such approaches help to minimise transmission and so make
“economic and infrastructural sense” [40].

18

4.3.3 By network infrastructure

38

Local can also be considered in terms of the physical networks and infrastructure that enable
energy to flow. As a key purpose of SLES is local balancing – “matching generation with
demand at a local level to minimise the amount of electricity exported out of and imported
into a local area” [76] – boundaries are often defined by network segment; e.g., all residents
connected to the low voltage network beneath a particular electricity substation [63] or
beneath a known supply bottleneck.

39

4.3.4 By social constructs

40
41
42
43

Local can also be defined through social constructs, determining boundaries more
conceptually through social structures and networks, social identity, or by considering the
people who can directly benefit from or participate in the SLES. Some interviewees
discussed “local” in terms of the social context driven by place and identify, where the

Considering local in this context also led interviewees to explicitly consider scale, for
example, transmission level vs. distribution level vs. sub-station level:
“anything from the sort of lower, secondary sub-station which might be 200-300
homes, scaling up through a primary sub-station which is a few thousand homes and
businesses and… probably back to the grid supply point… so that’s a very electrical
based definition of scale.” INT10
Most interviewees were unable to discuss network infrastructure without considering the
different scales at which these networks exist. This contrasts with the discussion around
map-based geography, where people are probably internalising the concept of scale (as
became apparent in the interviews – see Section 4.3.5), but not discussing this explicitly
when considering local in terms of physical geography and place.

sense of engagement:

Local energy system projects described in the literature vary wildly in scale, from single
building systems to anything below the level of national energy infrastructure. There was
general agreement among interviewees as well that the scale of “local” was somewhat
ambiguous:

41

4.3.5.1 Local at the smallest scale

42
43
44
45

“…people say, for us local is our village and in other places, local is their region.”
INT9
“…it could be a city, a town, even a county, I suppose, but it’s certainly got that
influence of context and place” INT3
“…it’s about the community feeling about the energy system in that area and so there
is a community with a vested interest in their energy system.” INT13
“people’s boundaries don’t stop just because there happens to be a grid supply point
at the end of their road.” INT8
Ofgem have recognised the importance of identity and engagement, defining local energy
as:
“Energy arrangements led by (or for the benefit of) a local group and for the benefit of
local consumers. A local group is a collection of people and organisations with
shared interests in local energy outcomes within a common geographical area” [19]
Devine-Wright and Wiersma [39], however, noted a common view of local is “an indicator of
place-based distinctiveness”, raising the issue that if an energy system is truly able to
address the “unique qualities and characteristics of different communities living in different
spatial areas”, it will by nature be bespoke and difficult to replicate.

“... it doesn’t have a clear meaning and it never will, so it could be 300 yards, it could
be 30 miles, it could be three miles, it’s some kind of suggestion of a geographical
boundary of an identifiable area or place, but I don’t think it will ever be exactly clear
what its boundaries should be in any kind of uniform, replicable way.’” INT11
The interviewees were also asked specifically what they would consider as the upper and
lower bounds in terms of the scale of local energy systems, which produced a wide range of
responses:

“It would be something as tiny, for example, as a passive, mixed model energy
generation & supply housing complex, with x number of families ... all connected into
one, single energy system ... and let’s hope we are not going to go as low in size as a
single, small block, in an estate, in a big city.” INT1

“I would certainly argue that the individual house is part of this, if only because that’s
the ultimate, individual unit that we might think about replicating….” INT8

4.3.5.2 Local at the biggest scale
“To me, the biggest is a city region or geographical setting that has some boundaries
drawn to it that are applicable to the energy sector, so it either is generation or it’s
regulation or it’s consumption or tariffing governance or whatever.” INT1
“I think local means that we’re not getting about hundreds of people, in my
conception. As soon as I say any of these things, I'm challenging myself thinking ‘why
can’t local mean a whole municipality?’ which I guess would be commonplace in
Germany and Scandinavia and elsewhere.” INT5
“If it was Surrey-wide or Oxford-wide, is that local or is that too big? … Where you
end that scale, as you get bigger, to the county scale and others is more tricky…”
INT8
Taking the smallest and largest examples given, this covers the same range of scales as is
present in the literature:
“what’s behind the meter is local, but in some sense, anything that’s below the
transmission active management is local, so those are kind of pushing towards each
other.” INT6

In this paper we have examined how socio-technical regimes associated with smart local
energy systems are conceptualised, and explored how they interact with wider pressures to
deliver value not realised (or not maximised) by incumbent arrangements. In this section we
discussion four key contributions of the paper: defining the key characteristics of smart local
energy regimes; exploring relationships between landscape and local pressures; linking
regime processes to desired outcomes; and the development of a conceptual framework for
exploring emergent SLES.

While there is not one clear definition of what a smart local energy system is, the findings
provide insight into the key elements that make energy systems “smart” and “local”.
Elements that deliver system “smartness” include the use of new information and
communication technologies as well as automation and self-regulation operating paradigms
to help improve system operation. In some instances, this will rely on autonomous operation,
in others through the use of new data and insights to inform more effective decision making.
Within a SLES this “smartness” enables increasingly localised forms of system balancing
and network management, supported by flexibility across energy vectors. “Localness” is
characterised by more local forms of system management, operation, governance,

ownership, and engagement. It is also defined by the geographical boundary around the
system, through consideration of generation assets, network infrastructure, or social identity.
Drawing on the wider theoretical framing provided by the MLP (outlined in Section 2), Figure
3 shows how the SLES regimes incorporate multiple niche technologies, business models,
and governance structures to enable new forms of localised energy system operation and
optimisation (e.g. local and automated forms of network management across energy
vectors), smarter decision making and planning, by new actors (e.g. local authorities, other
local stakeholders), and engaging users in new ways. This emerging SLES regime exists
within a local boundary and interacts with the wider energy system and other SLES regimes.
Through integrating these niche innovations in new and context specific ways, SLES
regimes are anticipated to deliver benefits (outlined in Section 4.1) that meet landscape
pressures related to reducing carbon emissions (i.e. addressing climate change and net-zero
legislations), delivering environmental eco-system benefits (e.g. aligned with the Sustainable
Development Goals), supporting a Just transition, providing energy services more efficiently
and driving economic prosperity, and increasing resilience and security of supply.
However, this conceptualisation of SLES regimes as the result of purposive transitions to
deliver multiple benefits (or meet multiple landscape pressures) raises a number of
questions related to: (1) whether some outcomes are more highly prioritised than others, (2)
how trade-offs are managed and by whom, and (3) how local needs can be aligned with
national or global pressures. As outlined in Section 4.1.5, SLES are anticipated to deliver
against local priorities as well as wider landscape pressures, so the interaction of these
drivers at different scales needs to be considered. The following sections explore these
issues in greater detail.

5.2 Landscape and local pressures
Energy system transitions are typically considered purposive, driven by concern for climate
change, energy prices, security of supply issues, etc., deliberately intended and pursued to
address these landscape level societal expectations, interests, or pressures [77, 78].
However, in the case of smart local energy systems, pressures from within the regime
(rather than the exogenous landscape) are also shaping SLES innovation to help meet local
priorities and needs. This type of transition, described by [77] as “endogenous renewal”,
means that innovation and transition could be steered by interests, values, and practices
prevailing in the incumbent regime, which may counter wider landscape pressures
necessitating more radical transition.
While the primary outcome of traditional energy systems (i.e. not necessarily ‘smart’ or
‘local’) is to enable energy services to be delivered to end-users of the system [79, 80]; the
transition toward SLES means these systems’ telos (or principal reason for being) become
less clear cut. Although energy service delivery will always be a necessary outcome for any
energy system, the provision of services beyond energy will likely become increasingly
important, or even dominant. As noted in Section 4.1.1, one interviewee explored the
possibility of data as a service becoming more valuable than energy as a service. While this
remains a hypothetical situation today, it raises interesting questions around how value is
determined, and by/for whom. For example, it is possible that the value of data may be
greater to actors or organisations involved in developing and managing the energy system
and associated services, while the value of energy remains the main priority for end energy
users. Therefore, as more actors become engaged in the energy sector through the
transition toward SLES, it is possible that identifying the ultimate purpose of the system
becomes increasingly challenging.
The findings from this work also suggest a blurring between primary outcomes and key cobenefits that smart local energy systems are expected to deliver. In addition to delivering
energy services in more effective or efficient ways, benefits include reducing costs and
making energy more affordable, addressing fuel poverty and energy equity issues, driving
carbon emissions reductions and enhancing wider environmental eco-system services,
increasing local resilience and the ability to cope with failure, and helping local communities
meet these fundamental needs in context specific ways. These objectives set the broader
context in which the underlying outcome (of providing energy and related services to system
users) are expected to be delivered. Thus, a SLES meets its basic objective, whilst also
delivering other outcomes, enabled by its “smartness” and “localness”.
A ‘smart’ energy system is expected to enable better and more effective use of resources
through being smart. This increase in effectiveness can take many forms. It can mean
reducing costs or mitigating losses. It can mean producing larger benefits for individuals, for
the system owners and operators, or for the wider world. It can mean producing the right
benefits for these groups, more consistent benefits, or a wider range of benefits. Ultimately,
this view of smart is about efficiency: doing more with less. Applying ‘smart’ principles
properly means making the best use of resources through improved information and
enhanced decision making and control capabilities, to maximise whole system benefits for all
system stakeholders. As such, smart may only be attainable temporarily; an energy system

and opportunities to improve.

5.3 Linking purpose (and outcomes) to process

Despite the expectation that SLES will deliver a wide range of benefits, the findings
presented very little insight into the process by which the arrangements of elements within
the SLES regime (e.g. hardware, software, processes, procedures, people that are required
for the operation of that system) would enable this. For example, Figure 4 presents a
depiction of how different dynamics of ownership between the same elements might affect
the outcomes achieved through a local energy system.

Similarly, the driver for ‘local’ seems to be to deliver additional benefits, particularly around
the ability of the system to deliver value to local actors, and to do so more inclusively across
communities involved. This raises interesting questions around how such inclusive value can
be realised, at what scale of locality, and engaging which actors. It also raises concerns
related to vested interests, and the interaction between SLES outcomes and wider system
outcomes. For example, while the literature considers potential social and equity benefits for
actors within a local energy system regime (e.g. making energy more affordable, addressing
fuel poverty issues, delivering benefits back into the community), there was some concern
expressed in the interviews around the potential for inequalities to emerge between
localities, and for some areas to benefit at the expense of others. Given that many smart
local energy system demonstration projects occur in areas with existing capacity and
resource to deliver them, this raises questions around need for policy or other mechanisms
to prevent other, less well-resourced areas from being left behind.
Another example of the need to consider scale, actors, vested interests, and inequalities
relates to management and governance issues. While energy systems have traditionally
been operationally managed using top down practices, the shift toward smart local energy
systems is encouraging a bottom up management practice (e.g. to balance supply and
demand locally, optimise local resource use, minimise network constraints). Given that
national and local networks may experience constraints and require ancillary services at
different times and for different durations, this opens up a range of questions about how
smart local energy system assets might engage in different markets (at different scales) or
provide services at different scales, and how prioritisation between participation in these
different markets can be negotiated. Furthermore, the increasing involvement of local
authorities in SLES decision making processes (e.g. local area and energy planning) open
up questions around how policies, regulation, and planning are undertaken, at what scale,
and by which actors.
There is currently no clear framework for considering the multiplicity of SLES benefits /
outcomes, their origin (e.g. landscape pressures, regime challenges), their beneficiaries (e.g.
incumbent actors, local communities, etc.), and their interactions or trade-offs with eachother (e.g. should carbon reductions, cost minimisation, or equity be prioritised) and across
scales (e.g. if maximising the use of renewable energy locally results in sub-optimal national
operation). Further research is needed to develop this framework, which would help
policymakers align local and national outcomes and negotiate trade-offs between outcomes.

B, leading to potentially different outcomes becoming viable (please note this is for illustrative
purposes only)

Similarly, Figure 5 shows how certain ‘smart’ elements are linked to each other, and to
outcomes, by considering pervasive information and communication technologies and data
generation embedded within SLES regimes. The way in which these may interconnect and
interact with existing elements is not clear or linear, and may introduce entirely new value
chains, goals/purposes, and business models into the SLES.

There also appears to be an embedded assumption that the availability and use of data will
lead to a range of positive outcomes (e.g. maximising the use of local resources, delivering
environmental ecosystem benefits). However, there is very little discussion of what data is

24

required and how it should be used to ensure these benefits are realised; for example, to
deliver environmental system benefits it is likely that data beyond energy system data will be
required. Furthermore, there is a risk that considering these elements of ‘smartness’ only
within the ‘local’ energy system context could lead to better outcomes at the local level but
worse overall outcomes. To ensure SLES can deliver both local and national benefits, it is
important to understand what the data requirements are, where they might come from, who
owns the data, and what rights or permissions over use may exist. The governance
arrangements for managing complex data sharing requirements are unclear at present.

Drawing together the insights from Sections 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3, we have created a conceptual
framework for examining SLES transitions (see Figure 6). This brings together the
theoretical grounding provided by the MLP (outlined in Section 5.1), but also incorporates
elements specific to SLES transitions, including (1) the regime level pressures (potentially
from incumbent actors) which count interact with the wider landscape pressures to either
promote or constrain radical transition as discussed in Section 5.2; (2) the local impacts
SLES are anticipated to deliver as well as the impacts on the wider energy system, resulting
from the specific arrangement of smart, local and energy system regime elements, as
discussed in 5.3 and (3) the interactions that SLES have with the wider energy (and related)
systems that they exist and operated within.

While SLES are expected to deliver a wide range of benefits, a number of issues need
further exploration to ensure SLES contribute to a socially just, economically prosperous,

and environmentally sound transition to net-zero. The following paragraphs outline the
managerial and policy implications for delivering SLES, the limitations of the current study,
and opportunities for further research.

6.1 Managerial and policy implications

Considering the potential for SLES to support transformative change, it’s important for policy
to consider how innovative SLES approaches may be legitimised and scaled in terms of
direction, pace, and speed to deliver net-zero. This requires extending traditional innovation
policy approaches to consider four additional dimensions highlighted in the current study: (1)
directionality, (2) demand articulation, (3) policy co-ordination, and (4) reflexivity [81].

This considers the creation of a shared vision around the goal of SLES. As highlighted in this
work, SLES are capable of delivering against a wide range of different outcomes, which may
not all be compatible, requiring prioritisations between different goals, and re-organisation of
SLES elements to deliver them. To mitigate against failure, policy frameworks must
articulate and shape this vision, accounting for the diversity of perspectives, creating a
structure within which different actors can work together to drive transformative change.
Given the “localness” of SLES, this means accounting for citizen and community objectives,
as well as sectoral, regional, and national priorities.

36

6.1.2 Demand articulation

37
38
39
40
41
42

This considers “users” of SLES, and the demand for such systems which may be necessary
to ensure continued uptake and innovation. Referring back to Figure 4, it’s important that
SLES are designed, managed, and governed in a way that local stakeholders perceive
benefits. These local stakeholders, who can be considered “users” of SLES, include citizens,
community groups, local authorities, and local businesses, who may all benefit directly (e.g.
from reduced household energy bills) or indirectly (e.g. in meeting net-zero targets, living in

SLES “smartness” can help optimise the system according to these objectives. However,
given than SLES are not operating in isolation, but are connected to the wider energy
system, this requires a consideration of scale; it is likely that conditions or parameters
relating to the wider system will be necessary to inform SLES optimisation (and indeed that
SLES optimisation may impact the wider energy system). Protocols for sharing data within
the SLES and between the SLES and wider system must enable the necessary data to be
available and usable in real time. Care must be taken in the design phase to ensure the
SLES has access to the data streams required for its optimisation, which may require
additional monitoring equipment to be installed.
This raises further policy implications associated with the real time sharing of operational
data between actors within the SLES and between the SLES and wider network; data
ownership must be established, value streams associated with the data needs to be
considered (e.g. does it have commercial value or is it presumed open), care taken to
ensure customer protection is maintained, and standards may need to be developed to
ensure available data is usable within the cyber physical framework being implemented.

cities with cleaner air) from SLES. To support innovation and roll out of SLES, policy
frameworks, regulations, market access and governance structures must ensure that SLES
are able to attend to these demand signals.

This calls for policy co-ordination across different systemic levels, which for SLES requires
thinking about the potential for additional institutional implications resulting from a shift
toward more localised systems. This may call for more locally relevant policy and regulation,
more localised planning (for example to deliver to locally specific goals and purposes), and a
greater involvement of local authorities at different scales in governing the operation of (and
investment in) local energy systems. The exact nature of this involvement within a local
energy system is unclear, and needs to be more explicitly considered alongside the broader
goals of both the local and national energy systems, examining how local decision making
and policy setting could support the delivery of these goals.

This calls for governance structures and regulations that enable experimentation, learning
and adaptation. For SLES this is particularly pertinent for two key reasons. The first is that
SLES are still incredibly new, and while they are anticipated to deliver a wide range of
outcome benefits to a wide range of actors, it’s not yet clear whether their current
arrangements can or will deliver expected outcomes, and whether there may be
unanticipated and unintended negative consequences. To ensure SLES continue to deliver
against their shared goals and objectives, policy structures need to be adaptive to lessons
learnt during this early stage of SLES development. This also means ensuring that the
necessary data is collected to allow SLES to be effectively evaluated.

The “local” element of SLES raises further implications related to equity and governance.
From a technical perspective, the elements of a local energy system may be understood by
considering how physical resources (such as supply, demand, and storage technologies in
the context of electricity or heat) are connected to local energy infrastructure. As the
interviews highlighted, the precise arrangement of physical networks may be an important
determinant of the ultimate structure of local energy system. The position on a substation, for
example, may decide whether two homes or business are more or less likely to be
interconnected through a local energy market, and may therefore determine whether they
are able to offer (and benefit from providing) energy or flexibility services. While SLES may
support more localised and active network management, policy makers must consider how
this impacts on competitive access to markets (operational today and in the future) within
and between local energy systems, and whether some actors may benefit and other lose out
due to the technical infrastructure arrangements.

Further design considerations for SLES emerge when considering the use of ‘smart’
technologies (e.g. to collect, store, and share data) and processes (e.g. artificial intelligence
and autonomous decision making capabilities) to optimise the system along a number of key
outcome variables. This is because the available energy resources, data, and intended
outcomes may change over time, so the design of SLES cyber physical infrastructure must

27

1

be agile, responsive, and flexible to these changing conditions, allowing the system to
remain “smart” as things change.

This work has opened a structured discourse around smart local energy systems, their
purpose/goals, and the elements and interconnections they embody. However, we recognise
that this initial exploratory study presents a number of limitations, and consequently,
opportunities for further research to extend the insights generated here.
While the work did aim to capture diverse perspectives of SLES through both interviews and
literature review, on reflection it is overly informed by academic insights. The literature
review did include grey literature as well as academic, however, the inclusion of insights
from policy makers, practitioners, and others working at the forefront of SLES development
(e.g. via interviews or case study work research) would add value. Similarly, it would be
useful to explore how insights from different cultural and geographical contexts globally
differ, and how SLES (or elements of SLES) are evolving differently in different contexts.
This work has also raised questions around the origin of pressures (and anticipated benefits)
driving SLES transition. Further work exploring where these pressures originate (e.g. from
incumbents within the existing regime, the landscape, or elsewhere) and who benefits (and
who will pay) from the SLES regimes created in response to these pressures would be
useful to understand: (1) conceptually what SLES regimes look like and how they are
different to current regimes (e.g. are they purposive, are they capable of delivering radical
change, or are they just incumbents responding to threats in the regime to maintain stability
and power) and (2) systematically the benefits (and negative consequences) that are
expected to accrue – what and to who – to explore the distributional effects and issues
related to energy justice.
Furthermore, this work didn’t seek to understand how smart local energy systems came to
be (e.g. through alignment of combinations of social and technical niches) and didn’t
consider in detail how the presence or absence of different SLES elements enable outcomes
to be delivered. Figure 4 and Figure 5 illustrate how these pathways could be very important
in allowing outcomes to be realised; to ensure the wider ranging and more nuanced goals of
smart local energy systems can be successfully delivered on, it is important that system
elements and their interconnections are understood, and mapped to these intended
outcomes. Further work is recommended to explore in more detail the pathways by which
the presence (or absence) of ‘smart’ and ‘local’ elements (including how they are connected)
can deliver beneficial outcomes and mitigate negative ones.

Keywords
Keywords used in journals to help readers navigate their topic of interest and are a helpful way
of determining how the authors describe their own work.
Keywords were recorded exactly as described in the journal, then grouped into themes of
keywords. The keywords themes indicated interest in:
·
·
·
·
·
·
·

The methods used in the study, most of which were modelling and simulation methods
Energy system management included keywords such as demand response, or
implementation strategies.
Energy generation keywords included smart grid or smart heat networks.
Energy futures keywords included business model or energy transitions.
Technology included keywords of Information technology and Web of things,
Scale and place keywords included local planning, scale and spatiality,
a small cluster of keywords were about energy justice such as theories of justice, energy
justice and sustainability.

There was little discernible pattern within the theme with most keywords coded once i.e. used
by one study.
