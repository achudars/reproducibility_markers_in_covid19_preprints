"3" "Introduction"
"4" "The 1970 election saw a n unexpected  change of government from Wilson’s Labour to Heath’s Conservative.  The country was harder to govern than before, mainly due the confluence of the  ongoing  industrial strife, the “Troubles”  in Northern Ireland,  and the  vigorous  “culture war” over the meanings of gender and sexuality.  Having declared   five states of emergency, the Heath government lasted until 1974 , wh en Wilson won two elections, one in March that yielded  a “hung” (minority)  parliament, and one in October that led to a razor-thin Labour majority.  this"
"5" "“Modern Britain”, t he dominant discourse of  Britishness  in 1970, is similar to its predecessor  in the year 19 6 0  in  terms of  its overall positive evaluation of  national outlook.   This Britain defined itself in terms  democracy, modernity, law and order,  social freedom, technology, leisure time,  and, especially,  justice and fairnes s .  Compared to previous Modern  Britains , it was also  more  modern , more secular,  and more youth-oriented."
"6" "On responding to the fragility of the economy, “Modern Britain” split into  two discourses that mirrored the positions of  the two main political parties. The   “Labour”  discourse  emphasized strong state intervention and s tronger unions, while the “Tory” discourses   insisted on harder work and more  competition.  As for security, the main threats were the Irish, or rather the growing violence  Protestants  and  Catholics  in Northern Ireland, and of course the communists.  All  three  discourses implied staying the course in foreign policy: supporting American and European allies, opposing the Soviet Union and helping the Third World.  Compared to  previous years, this  particular  Britain  appeared more resigned to its fall from  greatness—the economic and military might of the two superpowers was  self-evidently titanic relative to  whatever troubled the UK."
"7" "Part  I: Text selection"
"8" "The  archive consists of texts sampled from  across  the following five genres:"
"9" "L eadership  speeches.  Rather than going with a combination of the Queen’s Speech and the prime minister’s party conference speech, in this case I analyzed the speeches given by the outgoing  a nd incoming  prime ministers in the Debate on the Addres s on July 2, the opening day of Parliament— Harold Wilson of the Labour Party and Edward Heath of the Conservative Parry, respectively. This was appropriate given that in this year “the British leadership” was almost evenly split between two ideologically distinct parties.  ( In the June  general election , t he Conservatives came from behind to wi n with a majority of 30 seats ).  Both speeches were retrieved from the Official Report ( Hansard )."
"10" "Like in 1950 and 1960, I sampled  newspaper  items from  the  editions published on  15th day of every month  in  two highest circulating, mainstream dailies:  the left-leaning  the  Daily Mirror   and the  right-leaning   Daily Express .  This yielded the total of  96 items: 77 op-eds and 19  letters (details on the project website).  Items  from Fe bruary, March, and November were missing  because the 15th fell on a Sunday in each of these months and therefore no newspapers were circulated."
"11" "I defined the  category “op-ed” broadly to include columns  (both in-house, such as “Cassandra,”  and those supplied by syndicates, if applicable), editorials (typically team-written by editorial board members and unsigned), opposite-the-editorial pieces ( narrowly defined “ op-ed s ”— meaning,  opinion pieces submitted by a named author typically unaffiliated with the publication’s editorial board  and published on or next to the editorial page )."
"12" "“Letters to the editor” were also defined broadly to include both opinion pieces submitted by readers  (“Live Letters of the Week”)  on various editorials and news items as well as letters appearing in  assorted  advice column  ( “ Dear Abby ” ) .  This broad approach was useful for my purposes because virtually any topic subject to  op-eds and letters  appearing in newspapers could in principle hold  important  claims and disclaims about the national “we.”  An example in the 19 5 0 archive is a page twelve football section piece in the Express about  England  losing a match after leading by two goals—this was interpreted as a testament of nation-level arrogance (June 15)."
"13" "Two  high school textbooks  covering aspects of modern  British history are   D. P.  Titley’s   Machines, money and men , the first edition of what was then a popular, path-breaking textbook covering  social and economic history of Great  Britain from 1700 to the 1960, and Larkin’s  English History for Certificate Classes , which covered the 1789-1939 period."
"14" "Both books were coded in the entirety:  Titley’s  because of its thematic organization of chapters, and Larkin’s because it covered a rela tively short period of history."
"15" "Between the two, the  Titley  textbook is more advanced, as it was geared towards to both high school and university students. The Larkin textbook, in contrast, covered “the examination work in English history studied by Grammar and Secon d ary schools up to G.C.E. Ordinary level …[and] students working to Advanced level” (1964, p. 7)."
"16" "As with other UK reports, I  selected  these textbooks  by combing through the entries on the  Historyproject.co.uk website and through the early 1970s editions of  the professional magazine  Teaching History , whereby I looked for the best information on the “ most widely used   textbooks  in high schools of  England and Wales in 1970. ”   Availability also played a role in this selection in the sense that I was unable to source, in either quick or r easonably inexpensive fashion, the following sources :  R. J.  Cootes ’  Britain since 1 6 00  ( Longman s, 1st ed., 1968), P.  Mauger  and L. Smith’s  The British People 1 8 02-1968  ( Heinemann , 1st ed., 1969)  and  J. Ray ’s  Britain and the Modern World  ( Heinemann,  1st ed.,  1969 )."
"17" "Compared to the previous years, d etermining the  “ bestselling novels ”  proved  easier  thanks to an existing historical analysis of the UK bestseller research. My selections were  Endless Night , a spy novel by Agatha Christie, and  Force 10 from  Navarone , a World War II commandos adventure, by Alistair MacLean (sequel to MacLean’s 1957 bestseller  The Guns of  Navarone ). Each novel sold over 250,000 copies in the year under study and were ranked within “Top 3” in in the paperback category across different lists (only  Airport , a 1968 novel by the American novelist Arthur Hailey was consistently ranked higher).   G.F. Newman’s  Sir, You Bastard ,  Arthur Wise’s  Who Killed Enoch Powell? , Richard Allen’s (aka  James  Moffat’s )  Skinhead ,  and Frederick Forsyth’s  The Day of the Jackal   all   had usable storylines  for my purpose  but in each case the sales numbers appeared to be lower relative  to the above selections."
"18" "To select the leading UK-made movie  blockbusters of the  year  I followed the rankings based on both reserved-ticked and general release data that appeared in  The Times  on 31 December 1970. By far the two most successful movies of the year where  the World War II drama   Battle of Britain  (dir. Guy Hamilton) and  On Her Majesty’s Secret Service  (dir. Peter R. Hunt ) , a  James  Bond series movie based on a 19 52  novel by Ian Fleming.  Note that both movies had their premieres in late 1969, and then stayed in the British cinemas until late  1 970.  Ranked third in the annual survey of box-office returns was the drama  Women in Love  (dir.  Ken Russell ), also released in late 1969."
"19" "II British Identities in 197 0"
"20" "Table 1 lists  top identity c ategories, defined as the top 20  percent, by raw count as re covered  from the above archive .   This  covers 35 categories with 11  or more counts, ou t of 150+ categories in total. When appropriate,  categories not appearing in the table are discussed in this report as well ."
"21" "Fair/just , the top c ategory appearing in Table 1 , is an amalgam  of  two heretofore separ ately coded identity categories .  In the words of Harold Wilson, now speaking a former prime minister, his government had achieved"
"22" "the fairer social climate… fair, not only because social justice is an end in itself and one of the first duties of government, but also fair, as t he right hon. Gentleman will  rapidly discover, because ther e can be no solution to Britain  economic difficulties unless all of those who are asked to contribute to that solution, by their efforts, by their restraint—their sacrifices, even—can feel that what they are asked is fair and p art of a justly ordered society (Address)."
"23" "From this point of view, Britain, under Labour, aspired and under the Conservatives should aspire, towards being ever-more  fair.  To underscore the message Wilson proceeded to criticize Edward Heath’s cabinet for being too male and too rich, the Conservatives for being “reactionary” and “regressive”, and the fellow parliamentarians for failing to make “ the cricket grounds of Britain safe for racially selected teams to play on ” (Ibid)."
"24" "UK 1 970—Figure  1. Identity Categories by  Frequency ( Raw Counts )"
"25" "The rest of the archive  confirms a sense of the countr y’s  economic, social, and political divides: between the  wealthier   Home Counties  and the poorer  North ;   between the disorderly and violent  Northern Ireland , sometimes simply called Ulster, and the  orderly  rest of the country;  between  the old and the  young ; between men and women, between  tradition  and progress."
"26" "Some of these divides can be  interpreted  as  being  correlated with partisanship and ideology, at least according the discourse of the ruling elite. On the left was Wilson’s Labour, which  preoccupied  itself with  working  class  struggles , with  trade unions , and with human rights—both in  Northern Ireland  and with respect to Commonwealth immigration (“open” and “anti-immigrant” are both categories in 1970). On the right was the Conservative Party whose interests were said to  align with  business interests. Heat h, the party leader and the new prime minister sought to “ restor [e]  free dom of choice to the individual” as well as to curb “permanent immigration”  (Heath, Address).   He also wanted to see less partisanship   and more unity: “ we had a surfeit  of politics and very little responsible Government.  It will be exactly the reverse in the second half of  1970 under this Administration” and “ the greatest challenge which fa ces us still today [is…]  to create withi n freedom in Britain one nation (Ibid.)."
"27" "Britain identified as a  modern, capitalist  and  democratic  nation with an  activist state.   In the history textbooks, the nation became great through  empowering its people and through  trade a nd profit-making, which then came together to propel  the Industrial Revolution , expand commerce and create prosperity. The  Titley  (1969) textbook thematically covers the growth of England/Britain from its agricultural beginnings through the Industrial Revolution to the rise of organized labour and the welfare state.  The narrative is that of  progress  through state action in a number of areas: education  (p. 143, 144, 145), women ’s and children’s rights  (p. 205-208 , 108, 112), industrial relations (p. 106-9) and anti-slavery (p. 162). Naturally, Victorian and Edwardian periods stood as Others, as bywords for insecurity and inequality."
"28" "C lass  is a top category, as in 1950 and 1960. On the elite end of everyday discourse, the modal point of view was that of a politically conscious  middle class subject , whet her individual or institutional, asking why some groups in Britain were marginalized or proposing ideas on  how  to make the weaker  less dependent on decisions m ade by the stronger. The Larkin textbook explicitly connects the rise of industrial capitalism to the changes in British society and politics: “ The contrast between extreme wealth and extreme poverty became more glaring, and the battle between capit al and labour more clear-cut” (1964, p.  144)."
"29" "In the elite discourse, class divides were progressively narrowing. They were also contingent on events. In the texts about World War II, class matters but nowhere as much as  patriotism .  Consider  Battle of Britain : in  contrast to the  other squadron leader, Skipper, Cra nfield, an aristocratic Royal Air Force officer played by Michael Caine appears out of touch  and uncaring but willing to die for  king and  country. In  Navarone ,  the w hiskey -sipping  Jensen, the  chief i ntelligence  officer behind the commando raid and a   “ prototype for the  classic British naval captain” is an able warrior, as is  M iller, one of the commandos who just happens to be a brandy-loving  West Londoner  who “uses a napkin at meals."

"328" "On the mass end of discourse, however, class appeared more fixed.  Endless Night , Christie’s  whodunit  novel, centers on the doomed marriage of Ellie   Guteman , a bored, fragile American heiress who “ thought nothing of taking a plane over to England for twenty-four h ours and then flying back again,” and Mike Rodgers, a handsome local chauffeur keen to “move up” and “make good.” Poorly educated, Mike is confused about the difference between  Cezanne  and  tzigane  (“ whic h I gather is a gipsy orchestra”) and therefore insecure in front of Ellie:"
"329" "Ellie: “ I wish you wouldn't be so o bsessed with class distinctions.”         Mike: “Me!  What's your American phrase--I come from  t he w rong side of the tracks… I don't know anything really about pictures or art or music. I' m only just learning who to tip  and h ow much to give don’ t know the right clothe s to wear… I don't know the right way to talk about things and I don't know anything really about pictures or art or music. I'm only just learning w ho to tip and how much to give.”"
"330" "The elites and the masses agreed that capitalist modernity came at a cost.  In principle,  “ anyone” could succeed but “everyone” had to work—perform tasks or produce goods that other people want.   In reality the free market was often unforgiving regardless of one’s hard work. A textbook explained this well. “F armers  lost heavily” in the late nineteenth century due to the depression and foreign competition ( Titley  1969,  p. 159), while “[t]he years from 1900 to 1914 were prosperous for the country as a whole but as prices rose faster than wages, the workers tended to be worse off” (p. 196)."
"331" "In the elite discourse, Labour supporters were utopian idealists—also: democratic socialists—who sought to reduce  class inequality by transforming most aspects of capitali sm,  including private property. Conservative supporters, in contrast, were less sanguine about  statist  i deas and practices and  especially  about intervening in   the economy. This is evident in the op-eds.  In the Labour-leaning  Mirror , the Labour government receives high marks for its plan to spend money on “single women, pensioners, and lower-paid workers” (April 15). In contrast, op-eds and letters published in the pro-Tory  Express —in  Secret Service , this is Bond’s preferred daily—describe Britain as  over-taxed  and  statism  as a cause of economic and social ills, including,  to name a few examples ,  underpaid farmers  and nurses (January 15),  poor communication with the British diaspora (due to a high tax on mail t o and from Rhodesia; April 15) and rising food prices (May 15).  In  Endless Night , taxation is a source of major unease."
"332" "Trade unionism  was closely associated with socialism ,  but Conservative and Liberal Parties supported it because the alternative was a path to  electoral oblivion.  Indeed, anti-unionism was seen as retrograde: today’s employers could not manipulate the  employees  as before ( Titley  1969,  p. 88,  92).  For Prime Minister Heath, trade unionism went too far, into a “ chaotic state ”:"
"333" "The present rash of strikes, to such a large extent unofficial, is the symptom of impoverished industrial relations, of unsatisfactory machinery and of increasing disregard for obligations which have been undertaken. I believe that as a nation we are not doing justice to ourselves or to our history   (Address)."
"334" "T he elites and the masses consistently worried about the  fragility  of the British economy.  In the speeches given by the two prime ministers, the outgoing Wilson praised the strength of sterling and the strong balance of payments but not much else.  For the incoming Heath, Britain was “ a  trading nation ” dependent on international peace and stability, its economy suffering mightily from inflation (“ the w orst we have known for 20 years”), under-investment in manufacturing, low productivity, low reserves, strikes and “substantial overseas debts.” This was the more dominant perspective at both elite and mass levels of everyday discourse."
"335" "Like in 1950 and 1960, in 1970  Britain understood itself as  patriarchal , even if less patriarchal than before. British women were expected to be married in  their twenties , supportive of their children, and affectionate towards their husbands ( Mirror , December 15). That this arrangement curtailed their freedom was dismissed. One male letter-writer in the  Mirror  put it thus: “grumble away, lady, and make the old man babysit for you now and again while you have a natter with your girlfriends” (August 15). Also, from a French perspective, Britain was  a “man’s country”: “in France a woman dominates everything. It is a country of women… that’s why my husband likes to visit England. Because their women are of little importance” ( Express , May 15)."
"336" "The mass-oriented fictional sources echo  these sentiments.  In  Endless night ,  Mike does not  (insert connecting verb, otherwise makes no sense)  “managing females, however efficient and even handsome they are,” and Ellie thinks that marriage determines nationality: “I’m  American—or I was, but now I’m married to an Englishman so I’m an Englishwoman.” Both movies center on white, middle-aged and upper middle-class men in charge of aspects of national security  who complain about women, but c ounter-perspectives exist. In  Battle of Britain , a female section officer, a sexual Englishwoman, tells her squadron leader husband, an abusive Canadian, that she is not keen to transfer with him to another base: “I’m just not the type to wave a wet hanky in sooty stations.”  I will return to sexuality and gender below."
"337" "The modern, capitalist Britain  was understood to revolve  around  money. Rudolf  Santonix , a successful  architect  who designs Ellie and Mike’s house in  Endless Night  wants Mike to be comfortable with his new life: “Born poor doesn’t mean you’ve got to stay poor. Money’ s qu eer. It goes where it’s wanted.” Mike, on his part, professes discomfort as he splashes money on “m ore and more super luxury …. bigger bathrooms and larger houses and more electric light fittings and bigger meals and faster cars. ”"
"338" "To illustrate the rise of  consumerism  in Britain at the time, consider the  last two it ems on Mike’s list, meals and cars.  In 1970,   eat ing  out  was rising in popularity —half entertainment, half “ relief from kitchen chores ”  ( Express , April 15 ; all references are to  op-ed s unless otherwise noted ).   As for cars, their consumption, or at least the consumption of car culture, was soaring .  On Her Majesty’s Secret Service  (thereafter shortened as  Secret Service ) opens up with Bond  cruising a coastal highway in  his Aston Martin,  when a female driver in a red Mercury overtakes him. Following a dramatic encounter with the driver, Bond  introduces himself but  fails to learn h er name. To his luck, he later  spots  the same red Mercury at a casino parking lo t, thus locating the driver .  Though a fantasy scene in a fantasy movie, it arguably captured one idea of a good life, at least among British men."
"339" "As extensions of the individual self, cars were in high demand. Consequently,  as good capitalist, British carmakers were expected to welcome foreign competition as this was thought to lead to the availability of better and cheaper cars. The newest model of Renault, a French car, “will stimulate healthy competition which, in turn, can only benefit the motorists in the long run,” editorialized the  Express  on 15 May. And to fuel all those cars and the rest of its economy, Britain needed  to  keep its energy industry robust. According to the left-leaning  Mirror ,  British Petroleum’s new  oil find in Alaska should be celebrated as a huge business opportunity, not criticized for its potential impact on the life of caribou herds (December 15)."
"340" "Britain continued to define itself as  innovative , primarily  in science and  technology  but also more generally—in war, for example . An op-ed published in the  Express  on August 15 paints a portrait of a  young boy who  built a computer in his bedroom, suggesting that  “these youngsters are the natural inheritors of the tradit ions that made Britain great.”  Innovation was a function of good  education ,  which in fact is a top  ten identity category in Table 1 .  As the same newspaper explain in an op-ed published on December 15,  elementary and secondary school s should not be a  “comfortable conveyer belt”  for feeding universit ies but rather places where  students  develop  i nterest in knowledge and learn  skills.  The two newspaper pieces are indeed in  agreement:  with a  new generation of skilled, and creative people , Britain’s future may well be as bright and glorious, much like its past.  Alternatively, miss your opportunity to complete school and you are likely to be stuck with hopeless low-wage jobs:  “Petrol pump. Mechanic in a garage. Temporary clerk washer-up in a sl eazy night-club restaurant”  (Mike,  Endless Night )."
"341" "In 1970, t he British saw themselves as   being too  complacent  as well as rather  competitive  and  resilient  (the last category is not in the top fifth ) .  Complacency emerged in trade, football, and  politics. In this  “ strawberries-and-cream election ” —this  conjure s  up  a lazy English summer (and the annual international tennis  tournament  at Wimbledon)—voters are naturally unlikely to show up at the voting booth, editorialized the  Express  on June 15, which is why the Conservatives needed to double their voter mobilization effort. On September 15, the  Mirror  made a similar point about the union leaders, who appeared to be more interested in themselves (“ Why do you dream only of money?” ) than in helping the  Labour  Party (“ the  Labour  movement ”)   come up with winning new id eas."
"342" "Competitiveness, in contrast, was Britain’s natural state. As the Larkin textbook explains, England became powerful by competing with other nations over many centuries. Resilience  emerged in war.  In  Battle of Britain ,  t he leaders hip, starting with Winston Churchill and his generals, are   portrayed as  resolute,  aircrews are effective, and the London masses defiant, refusing to be  bowed by  German bombs .  In one scene a man in charge of the air raid siren is visibly unemotional when learns about the approaching swarm of  Heinkels .  The novel  Nava rone   follows the same model: the job of the  British  co mmandos, who are the soldiers   of exceptional “ initiative, self-reliance, in dependence in thought and action,”  is  to  “turn near-conviction into absolute certainty.”"
"343" "The British  also  understood themselves as  essentially  benevolent   (a composite category including  compassionate and  caring) —towards each other,  towards the former colonies, towards animals. For example,  f ox-huntin g, an upper-class pastime that some insisted was a  traditional method of controlling the fox population, was rejected as  woefully  retrograde: “there is a very humane method of trapping foxes without the need for horses and hounds” ( Mirror , January 15)."
"344" "All  British aspired to be  honest   and expected honesty from their leaders .  On April 15, a n editorial in the  Mirror , the newspaper favoring the  Labour  Party, applauded the  Labour   Chancellor  for proposing an “honest budget” and refusing to “match the Tories in a perilous auction of lavish tax cuts . ”  At the election time two months late, a  letter  to the  editor s  of the  Express  commended Mr. Heath,  the Conservative candidate for the prime minister,   f or his transparency and honesty and proposed that he “deserves voters trust” (June 15). (The  Express  editorial on that day in fact agreed with this assessment, calling  Labour  politicians  “min d-benders” and “brainwashers.” ).  Similarly  disappointing were dishonest practices in the marketplace.  Companies were   said to be  lifting prices  of tea for no other reasons than to  trick shoppers into believing that they were buying  a better quality item ( Express , August 15 ).    Endless Night  mention s  the “corruption of the rich,”  but without expanding on it."
"345" "British democracy was not contradicted by the existence of “the Royals.” While the Queen stood for leadership, she was also understood as “entertainment.” In one office scene, Bond downs his drink while nodding in the direction of the Queen’s portrait on the wall.  Tradition al   was a nebulous identity category, one that cross ed  over into monarchic and nostalgic (not in Table 1). Those  feeling  disoriented by the pace of modern life aspired for a more traditional Britain, as did those who refused to give themselves over to t he  new industrial machinery, new medicines, new foods and food production practices, and new fo rms  of  entertainment .  For still others, tradition meant safety and sensibility.  Speed limits on British roads did not seem to apply to “car maniacs” ( Mirror , May 15, letter).  The new computer age meant that fewer people were communicating with each other and more were communicating with machines, that electric bills were higher than before, and that Britain’s new bank notes were “incomprehensible” ( Express , August 15).  On occasion, traditional also referred to the progress made in the previous decades: the expansion of health service and education or the provision of council housing."
"346" "Several texts surveyed imply that Britain was Christian but many more articulate it as  secular.   Virtual ly all fictional characters are the latter .  Mike from  Endless Night  is an example. For him, “God” is a merely metaphor for power. He recognizes that his mother provided him with decent upbringing but does not feel morally debased for participating in  organized crime (“race-course gangs, and dope gangs, the rou gh and tumble dangers of life”). He dismisses superstition, too. He  builds a dream house on Gipsy’s Acre, despite hearing from everyone that  there  was a curse on the place. In  Battle of Britain , two government officials acknowledge that radar is the vastly outnumbered Royal Air Force’s secret weapon. “We should be trusting radar  and  praying to G od . Or is it the  other way a round?”   Importantly, secularism  characterized England,  but  not necessarily the rest of the UK   where there appeared to be more interest in the supernatural and the miraculous.  In  Navarone , Captain Mallory is said to be of Scottish descent—“and everyone knew how the Scots indulged in those hea thenish practices of second sight and peering in to the future.”"
"347" "In 1970,  Britain was a  free  society. N ational  tole rance for sexual   liberty , for one,   was higher than ever before. In the  Bond movie , for example, the eponymous protagonist is seen flipping through  Playboy , a soft porn magazine.  The British were c onflicted over this development;  some text s  approved it, but most did not. Sexual liberty appeared to reflect and also reinforce a rising culture of permissiveness in the British society. An author in the  Mirror   described a new play that  contained rape, murder, and orgies  with  “appalling fascination , ”  while expressing confusion about the constitution of contemporary arts   (April 15).   C ontroversial cultural agenda s were understood be pushed by the elites. As for the masses, their pleasures were simpler.  An  important feature of British identity was an affinity for alcohol and for social drinking. In some towns, “ the drunks Olympics” were  commonplace, keeping the police  busy ( Mirror,  August 15)."
"348" "Going back to the point about patriarchy,  Britain’s  growing  s ex ual liberty was  gendered .  N aturally men could engage in sexual  innuendos  and sexual promiscuity in ways that women could not. An op-ed in the  Mirror  titled “Questions of a revealing nature”  dared   British  women to assess their wardrobe to determine if they were a “hussy,” a prude, or somewhere in between ( December 15 ).  In comparison to some their Australian counterparts, however, British women were by definition prude— consider one  female columnist’s fascination with “skimpy bikinis” Down Under ( Ibid.,  April 15)."
"349" "The Bond movie  goes an extra mile in sexism and  hyper- masculinity .   In the very first scene   Contessa  Tracy di  Vicenzo  is   literally  saved  by Bond—he stops her from  committing suicide by drowning  on a beach .  In a following scene, Tracy’s  father Draco, a Corsican Mafioso  with ties to MI6 , attempts to sign her off to Bond for a “dowry of one million pounds in gold.” Draco’s explanation is that his traumatized daughter Tracy does not need a psychiatrist: “ what she need is a man, to dominate her, to make love to her, to make her love him. A man like me.”  In another scene, Bond hits Tracy,  which makes her interested in him even more.  By the end of the movie,  Tracy  gains more  agency , albeit  never  vis-à-vis Bond. “Obey your husband in all things,” says Draco at her daughter’s wedding. “But of course I will, as I always obeyed you.”"
"350" "In the Bond movie sexism  also  goes hand in hand with racism.  Bond , posing as a kilt-wearing heraldry scholar,  arrives to  Blofeld’s  health institute in the Swiss Alps  and is invited to dinner where he is eating with the institute’s dozen  female patients . The curious aspect of the dinner is that each guest is given food from their  parts of the world : an  Indian woman is  eat ing naan;  a   East Asian  woman eating a bowl of rice , white European women eating, variously, chicken, steak, pork, potato,  or  corn,  and  then  an  Africa n woman eating  seemingly nothing but  a  peeled  banana.  The one  most  interested in Bond is Ruby , an Englishwoman, who creatively invites him to her room.  In the novels,  racialized hierarchies and  racist interpretations of society were  common place . Three different characters in  Endless Night  describe “ g ypsies” as a   “thieving lot.”  In  Battle of Britain , C zechs  and Polish fighter pilots are mistrusted: a   “ menace to themselves and to us .”   Andrea  Stavros , the Greek member of the commando squad in  Navarone , is  strong , funny and fi lthy.   W hite  skin conferred status but was itself subject to hierarchy."
"351" "Britain was also  powerful, meaning   influential  if not world-leading .  A nation aspiring to be  fair & just  naturally pursued an ethical foreign  policy or, in the words of Wilson , “ a heritage of foreign and Commonwealth policies rooted in morality, idealism and concern for the dignity and equality of men everywhere—a heritage which we fostered, a heritage o f which we shall ever be proud ” (Address).   Wilson was disappointed with the Conservative government’s decision to approve an  arms deal with South Africa:"
"352" "I  hope that the Government have worked out for themselves what it will mean for our standing in the United Nations. Have they thought this thing through? ...   Have they thought of what it means in terms of the isolation of Britain in a small rump of  colonialists and one or two ex-colonial Powers, with all that this means in terms of loss of influence in world affairs?  (Address)."
"353" "Taken together, the leadership speeches show a sense of ambiguity about Britain’s  post-imperial  moment. In his Address, Labour’s Wilson spoke against “ treating Commonwealth citizens, from the old and the ne w Commonwealth alike, as aliens” for reasons of “standing” and diplomacy.  His Conservative rival Heath disagreed. Britain’s foreign policy should be primarily about Britain. Sometimes that included supporting the former colonies—“ our Commonwealth allies in Malaysia and Singapore , in Australia and New Zealand”—but no t  always. “ Sometimes—I think particularly of Africa—decisions have been taken as a result of emotional pressures which, however sincere, have not always been fully reasoned, and neither  have they been reasonab le” (Address).  In fact, Heath appeared kee n  on bring ing  the empire back: “ The right hon. Gentleman did us a good turn by calling the election a year before he had to do so, and 18 months before the last date for our withdrawal  from the Gulf and the Far East” (Ibid.)."
"354" "Throughout the archive,  mi litary  power   emerges as a  key source of British influence  in the world .  In the Larkin textbook, England is a  gr eat military power  throughout . The Royal Navy is unsurpassed and colonial misadventures—the 1883 Sudan intervention, for example—are thankfully rare (1964  p. 38 -9, 99) .  The military and war are part and parcel of British life in all fictional work surveyed. In  Endless Night , the town’s most powerful figure is a judicial officer named Major Philpot and we learn that Ellie’s brother died in the Korean War."
"355" "The novel  Navar one  and the movie  Battle of Britain   normalize war even further by linking  Britain’s greatness  to  its  war-fighting  prowess in World War II .  In the novel,  the British commandos see the Mediterranean a s a  British lake and Yugoslavia ends up being  within t he British sphere of influence:  “ We are the  only   people who are at present supplying them with r ifles, machine-guns, ammunition  and medical supplies .”  In the movie , the smallness of “the island” is emphasized to magnify the victory. In one of the early scenes, the British ambassador in Switzerland refuses to talk surrender with a German emissary: “We are not easily frightened. A lso we  know how hard it is f or an army to cross the channel.” Furthermore, in addition to being an impregnable fortress, Britain is able to mass-produce rather solid weaponry .  In a  scene  toward the end  of the same movie , when  Göring   asks German pilots what they need to win, one  pilot declares:   “A squadron of Spitfires!”"
"356" "Like before, Britain was obsessed with  the  US , with  American modernity  once again  configured as simultaneously attractive and repulsive.  According to the  Titley  textbook, o nce the US caught up with Britain in the 19th century, the US never looked back: their cars and their steel were cheaper, their financial c apital more influential ( 1969, p. 189, 226, 243).  Endless Night  sends the same message. Compared to American breakfast—“ c o ffee and a glass of orange juice and n ot hing much else ”—English breakfast looks fit only for a “Victorian squire,” notes Mike."
"357" "Elsewhere, Americans   emerged as confident, hardworking, and innovative but also overly individualistic, profligate, and racist. Closely allied to the US, the British celebrated American achievements and shared in the pain over  the failure of the Apollo 13 mission. Human  space travel  may be pure hubris by default, but especially so if “we” forget that it is  “courage, not computers, wh ich advances human knowledge” ( Express,  April 15, op-ed )."
"358" "In 1970,  Europe  appears as significant as the U.S. or more significant if we considered France and Germany, the two historical rivals and contemporary partners. The Larking textbook portrays England as a shrew player of the European balance of power game. The  Titley  textbook is more level-headed. Britain’ s industrial  supremacy was lost by the end of the nineteenth century, not just to  Germany and the USA , but also to  France : “ Even France was outpacing  us in motor vehicle production” ( Titley  1969, p. 170). France, once an enemy, was now a close partner—that is, “now” that the reasonable Georges  Pompidou  succeeded the intransigent Charles de Gaulle (Ibid.: 173), and “now” that the two countries spent almost a billion pounds to develop the Concorde supersonic passenger jet (Ibid.: 255)."
"359" "Elsewhere, France was regarded as a must-see place for the British masses.  One newspaper contributor is fascinated w ith British fascination with this  “naughty”  country   where denied whims run wild—“a bidet is primarily for washing the crotch” ( Mirror , December 15).   Like the Bond movie,  Endless Night  constructs  Europe  as a place of leisure and high culture, whereby France is the top destination, followed by Italy. The novel’s protagonists thus spend their honeymoon on the French Riviera and spend “ fabulous  sums for pictures and furniture” in Paris."
"360" "Compared to  France,   Germany  was more powerful and, thanks to the fresh memories of the two world wars, far more menacing. In the  Titley  textbook:  “During the First World War one of the greatest perils had been the packs of German U-boats which blo ckaded our sea routes” ( 1969,  p.  244).  World War II-themes works of fiction respect Germany weaponry, its warplanes,  Schmeisser  machine-pistols , and tactics. A line from  Navarone : “ the Ge rmans have the most impregnable  de f ensive positions  in the history of modern warfare…. our finest Allied divisions have broken on  it. ” Moreover  the British forces are always outnumbered.  Battle of Britain  opens with the British evacuating all serviceable aircraft from the capitulating France. The British government is aware that it has “ 650 planes co mpared to 2,500 for the Germans.”"
"361" "Both  Navarone  and  Battle of Britain  portray German soldiers as sleek and arrogant (although in the movie they lose their composure towards the end). In  Endless Night  there is a German character named Greta, an au pair and Elli’s friend who together with Mike plots Elli’s demise. In newspapers, East Germany, a communist country and a Soviet ally, barely appears, with “Germany” meaning “West Germany,” which is always understood as an awesome economic powerhouse. A sense of inadequacy vis-à-vis the German Other was acute during  the World Cup football tournament in Mexico  when a  gritty West German team recovered from two goals down  against England to score in extra time . This was a  national  slap in the face:  England’s first-ever competitive loss to West Germany, a payback for the last World Cup in which  the English  gloriously beat  the Germans  in the final match played in London ( Mirror  and  Express ,  June 15)."
"362" "Germany was consistently constructed as  Western , like Britain.  In  Navarone ,  the  Iron Cross-wearing   German  officer  Neufeld  bemoans that he has to fight  his World War II  in Yugoslavia: “I wish to heaven that we were fighting a normal war against normal people, like the British or Americans.”   Some pages later,  Captain Keith Mallory  appears to sympathize with his German opponent:  It was a war which the We h rmacht coul d never win, which the sol d i ers of no Western European country could ever have won, for the people of the high mountain s are virtually indestructible.”"
"363" "Again like in 1950 and 1960 , t he most threatening  Other  was  Soviet Russia , which was understood as a  distillation of the  worst aspects of the twentieth century: imperialistic, militaristic, and totalitarian, Britain’s living antithesis. The Soviet economy was regarded as no match for the  West,  but its military was.  The Third World , with its conflict and poverty,  was equally antithetical to the British sense of Self. Simply put, the elites and masses agreed that  Third World countries were unfree thanks to the centralization of economic decision-making in the hands of small and ofte n ruthless elites.  The Middle East   is described as tragic, a place riven by  geopolitical struggles  and political extremism   ( Express,  June 15).  The new prime minister’s own preference was for Britain to stay out of these imbroglios. “ Sometimes—I think particularly of Africa—decisions have been taken as a result of emotional pressures which, however sincere, have not always been fully reasoned, and ne ither have they been reasonable”  (Heath, Address).  Accordingly, Britain should think twice before condemn ing  apartheid South Africa for its “racialist practices” and jeopardize its “vital defence interests” (Ibid.)."
"364" "Last but not least,  let us pause over  the meaning o f “we” across coded texts. To begin with ,  “Britain” in 1970  still primarily meant “England ” .  This was plainly evident in history textbooks, as when Larkin  mentions “ the English agreement with Russia in 1907 ” (1964, p. 131).  So, even though there was due recognition that the British Isles have always been multicultural and multi-national, there was little doubt that the prevailing expression of Britishness was Anglocentric— much like in 1950 and 1960."
"365" "The British “we” also extended onto the rest of  the  British world, albeit less frequently than in the previous years under study. The  proper  term for this Greater British Self was  “ the C ommonwealth”—also a confirmation that the British had long  ago  abandoned imperial glory.  Addressing the special ties within the latter,  Titley   explains that between 1850 and 1945 two  million people emigrated to Canada, Ne w Zealand and Australia, while thereafter Britain received “ a large number of immigrants from the Commonwealth ” ( 1969,  p. 142) . In the m ass texts, the Commonwealth feels somewhat  closer:  Navarone   and  Battle of Britain  each have an Old Commonwealth protagonist, respectively a New Zealander and a Canadian.  The most significant Other at home was Northern Ireland—a “situation” that neither prime minister  seemed able to solve.  The position of the Republic of Ireland was liminal—part of “our” problem."
"366" "Part III Discourses of British identity  in 1970"
"367" "An ideal-typical Briton in my 1970 archive was an adult male who had a loving family  ( a large one )  and a steady job in the city. He strived to either own or upgrade a house  (probably in a suburb) , a car, and a TV —in that order . With his friends he  regularly  went to a  local  pub. He read newspapers and enjoyed his weekends—fishing or watching football  with mates .  Fictional stories about men’s men, like James Bond or World War II commandos, were  another way to pass the leisure time.  He was worried about the economy, did not understand the youth culture, never travelled abroad but desired to v isit Europe, especially France."
"368" "As Table 2 indicates, Britain and the British imagined themselves to be democratic and free-trading, more influential than most other nations, a synonym for m odern , secular, orderly, ben evolent and civilized country.  The people of Britain considered themselves to be  mostly or essentially  free, honest, fair and just.  Britain was a Western country, allied with America and Europe against the Soviet Union, whose  authoritarian government  s ilenced the dissenters, thus ruining hopes of the Russian people to  develop a strong economy  and consume modern goods .   Further, thi s Britain w as always benevolent, hence  feelings of  goodwill towards both Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland. Ostentatious immigration from Asia and Africa had much to do with this benevolence, too.  Mix all of these  ideas  together, and you get a discourse called “Modern Britain.”"
"369" "The ideal-typical  Briton voted either Labour or Conservative but believed that the two political parties existed in a rough balance.  Beyon d “Modern Britain”, we can  identify two more  Britains ,  which mirror the more ideological wings of these two main parties. I prov isionally call these discourses, in line with my 1950 report,  “ Traditional   Britain” and “Socialist  Britain . ”  In general, both Tories and Socialists  agreed on the need to cultivate the institutions and forces that made Britain great—its patriotic people, responsible government, strong military ,  solid manufacturing and service industries, competent professional associations and the media, and of course the world’s finest schools and universities.  But they  disagreed about what is to be done about the n ation’s fragile economy. The Socialist  discourse  held  that the British state should continually intervene to  make British life fair and just. Indeed, the main problem with Britain in this view was that  the working class  was no longer working—one million workers were unemployed in January 1972 .  By the same token, a  series of  unprecedented  strikes that rocked the n ation throughout the 1970s made  sense  only  within this discourse."
"370" "The Traditionalist  discourse in contrast  lionized competitiveness and  criticized   over- taxation ; indeed, a  Britain ruled by proper Tories  would rid itself of failing industries and aggressive trade union activities.  Indeed, the Heath 1970-1974 government institutionalized  many aspects of this discourse, starting with the  reform of the tax system  and of industrial relations laws. H owever, the Traditionalist   discourse  was also characterized with nostalgia for a  past  Britain, meaning , for instance ,  a nation  in which the younger generation would be enamoured with the monarchy rather than  Marxist feminis m .  The figure that arguably best represented this  cultural dimension  of the Traditionalist  discourse  was Enoch Powell , the maverick Tory politician  then  best known for his  anti-immigrant racism ."
