Abstract
This research is aimed at finding out the influence of lecturers’ language style on students’
academic self-efficacy in higher education in Indonesia. This research is conducted to
describe the correlation between lecturers’ language style and students’ academic. As one of the
aspects of forming academic self-efficacy, language style has an important role because someone
who can get information verbally about his ability in mastering certain duty tends to do more
efforts. In addition, it makes him more diligent in doing a duty. Also, language style positively
increases the student's self-confidence and vice verse. This research involves seventy students who
fill in the questionnaire about the lecturer language style and academic self-efficacy scale. Data
were analyzed by using simple linear regression analysis. The result of the research shows that
lecturer’s language style has a coefficient of determination of 23.5% towards the students’
academic self-efficacy. Finally, this research affirms that positive lecturer language style can
improve the students’ belief towards their ability while the negative language style can weaken the
students’ self-efficacy. This is supported by the statement of Pajares (2002) who state that the
negative language style can easily weaken the students’ self efficacy.

1. Introduction
The construct of self-efficacy introduced by Albert Bandura for the first time in the journal "A
Psychological Review" in 1977 has received continuous attention and research from scientists.
Research on this construct has produced thousands of writings in various forms of publishing such
as journals, books, and studies in the university environment. The results of self-efficacy research
show that self-efficacy has an important influence on a person's behavior and performance.
Research for more than 20 years has shown that self-efficacy is proven to significantly has
influenced career choices (Betz, 2004), performance, and persistence (Lent, Brown & Larkin,
1984).
Someone forms self-efficacy by integrating four main sources of self-efficacy, namely
mastery experiences, vicarious experiences, social persuasions and physiological states (Bandura
1977, 1986). But unfortunately, not many studies on self-efficacy have focused on sources of selfefficacy (Anderson and Betz, 2001; Muretta, 2004). Pajares (1997) states that research on selfefficacy as a dependent variable only gets a small portion in various studies on self-efficacy.
Therefore, to develop theory and intervention especially in education, it is very important to
explore how students develop their self-efficacy through the four sources of self-efficacy
mentioned by Bandura (Lent, Lopez, & Bieschke, 1991).
The social persuasion or verbal persuasion is the third source of formation of self-efficacy.
This social persuasion can involve verbal judgments made by others towards someone. Therefore,
the third source of self-efficacy is often referred to as verbal persuasion. A person who gets verbal
information about his or her ability to be able to master a particular job or task tends to make a
greater effort and make him more diligent in completing a task. Positive persuasion can encourage
and support someone and conversely negative persuasion can weaken self-efficacy. According to
Pajares (2002), it is generally easier to decrease the self-efficacy through negative judgment than
to strengthen it through positive encouragement.
Data collected from various research journals shows that research on self-efficacy has been
conducted by many experts. These studies mostly examine the influence and relationship of selfefficacy to other variables. For example, the academic self-efficacy influence on performance and
adjustment (Chemers, Hu & Garcia, 2001); Goal settings (Zimmerman, Bandura & Martinez-Pons,
1992), academic settings (Pajares, 1996), academic outcomes (Multon, Brown & Lent, 1991;
Zajacova, Lynch & Espenshade, 2005), self regulation (Klassen, Krawchuk & Rajani, 2008),
academic motivation (Schunk, 1991), academic functioning (Bandura, Barbaranelli, Caprara &
Pastorelli, 1996), achievement goals ( Coutinho & Neuman, 2008; Mahyuddin et al. 2006; Lent,
Brown & Larkin, 1984), career counseling (Betz, 2004), and emotional intelligence (Moafian &
Ghanizadeh, 2009). Research that addresses how self-efficacy is formed and how many sources
of self-efficacy play a role in the formation of one's self-efficacy are not widely found, even
research that specifically traces the sources of academic self-efficacy, particularly social
persuasion such as lecturer language style. Some related studies only examine how language
brokering relationships (Buriel et al. 1998) and language learning strategies (Wong, 2005; Yılmaz,
2010) on self-efficacy. Therefore, this study attempts to examine the effect of lecturer language
style on students’ self-efficacy in higher education in Indonesia.

2. Literature Review
Lecturers use a variety of language style to create an effective learning environment. Each of them
has a typical style in presenting ideas and concepts, develop research, do devotion, and spread
knowledge. In this case, the language style is delivered as a way for them to express themselves.
In a communication event, the style of the language as a medium of communication has a huge
influence. It should be easily accepted and understood that the purpose of the speech act is
successfully done. The utterances produced can reflect the personal character of the speaker. The
better a person's style, the better the people vote against him—conversely, the worse of a person's
language style, the worse ratings given to him anyway. In a communication event, language styles
contribute some significant effects on the audience. In this regards, Austin and Searle call this with
the perlocutionary act. It is an utterance that contains or has the power of influence to those who
listen. The power of these influences can intentionally or unintentionally be created by the
speakers. It is clear that the lecturer's language intentionally or unintentionally gives a
psychological impact on students as learners. The psychological impact can take the form of selfmotivation, self-efficacy, and the creation of good interpersonal relationships in vice versa
(Gunawan & Kadir, 2017). Increasingly, some experts agree that culture, language, and social
factors are being recognized as having an impact on learning (Batmang, et al., 2018).
Self-efficacy is one of the psychological states influenced by the using of language style.
Bandura & Schunk (1981) argue that self-efficacy is defined as students’ judgment of their
potency to organize and conduct courses of action needed to achieve designated types of
performances. They are a form of self-evaluation that effects decisions individuals make,
the efforts they exert, and their mastery of behavior (Eastin & LaRose, 2000). This theory
proposes that students who believe they can totally perform an activity will differ from students
who do not. The former is likely to exert more effort, n e e d l o n g e r time, and master the
needed skills earlier than the latter. In addition, Schunk and Pajares (2002) state that students
with a high efficacy belief can employ more strategies of cognitive and metacognitive and they
persisted longer than those who did not.
Bandura's (1984, 2006) research support him to s t a t e that students' self-efficacy beliefs
are highly predictive of their ability to accomplish academic tasks. This is in line with several
researchers who have found that among other motivational belief, self-efficacy i s a stronger
effect on academic performance than the others. (Lent, Brown & Larkin, 1987; Pintrich & De
Groot, 1990) However, students' perceptions or experiences of previous performance contribute
the most important role in student judgment of self-efficacy. For instance, students may form
inaccurate estimations of their own efficacy in a particular task unless they have experience in
that task, or in tasks they perceive as being similar. Successes and failures by themselves
do not improve or decrease self-efficacy beliefs; rather, it is how the students translate those
experiences that have an effect. Hence it is stated that self-efficacy is domain specific, and
beliefs about efficaciousness in performing one task cannot be predicted to apply to a d u t y
in a different domain. Similarly, no amount of confidence can result in success when the
m a i n n e e d e d skills and knowledge are absent (Pajares, 2002). The implication is that
while self-efficacy is used to be predictive of student achievement, the basic experiment
for students' perceptions i s i m port ant to be carefully considered.

Bandura and Wessels (1997) state that self-efficacy beliefs are affected in four ways,
and ranked them in order of most to least influential on behavior: enactive mastery experience,
vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological and affective states. Enactive
mastery is b e l i e v e d to be the most influential experience in f o rm ing efficacy beliefs. Past
performances serve as an indication of the extent to which one can succeed in doing a duty.
However, while perceived success can c r e a t e a strong sense of efficacy beliefs, easy
successes are also easily discouraged by failures. According to Bandura and Wessels (1997),
vicarious e x p e r i e n c e also forms efficacy beliefs because students often compare their
abilities to those of their mates or others who they consider are similar to themselves in
some way. This does not support that students equate their efficaciousness to their friends;
rather, their perception of their friends' capabilities in comparison with their own perceived
ability prepares a means by which they can create judgments about their performance. Verbal
persuasion refers to how self-efficacy beliefs can be affected through the m o t i v a t i o n or
other verbal communication of significant others, that is, people who are considered to have
mastery of a given res ponsi bi l i t y. However, Bandura and Wessels (1997) concluded that
self-efficacy beliefs, especially those founded on enactive mastery and vicarious experience,
are not as easily affected by verbal persuasion. The fourth significant factor on self-efficacy
beliefs is the perception of physiological and affective states in regarding to performance of
a task. In the words of Benigh and Bandura (2004) that people read their tension, anxiety, and
depression as signs of personal deficiency. It is therefore important to consider students'
physiological and affective states when designing and implementing learning activities. Verbal
persuasion here includes the language style of the lecturers in higher education.
3. Method
A descriptive qualitative and quantitative study was conducted in this research. It was conducted
by observing lecturer language style to students in teaching and examining the final project and
students' academic self-efficacy at State Islamic Institute of Kendari, Southeast Sulawesi,
Indonesia. There were fourteen lecturers observed as purposive sampling. The lecturers came from
four different faculties, namely Tarbiyah and Teacher Training Faculties, Sharia Faculty,
Ushuluddin, Adab and Da'wah Faculty, and Islamic Economics and Business Faculty. The sample
consists of seven male lecturers and seven female lecturers. To obtain the various style of language
lecturer presented to students in the classroom or other, the researchers conducted in-depth
interviews with seventy students. The interviews were about what the students think about the
language style of the lecturer. From here, it is clear that what speeches are used by lecturers when
teaching or testing student theses. The theory used in this discussion is Keraf (2006) theory of the
language style model and Austin (1962) theory of perlocution speech. Keraf theory is used to
analyze the language style model used by lecturers while Austin theory is used to analyze the effect
of language style on student academic self-efficacy.
After getting the language style data, the lecturer prepared a questionnaire about the
language style of the lecturer. Furthermore, the self-efficacy questionnaire was distributed to
seventy of the same students. Seventy of these students came from four faculties and ten different
study programs, such as Islamic Education, Management of Education, English Education,
Language Education, Islamic Guidance and Counseling, Islamic Guidance, Islamic Economics,
and Business, as well as Family Law and Constitutional study programs. The students consist of

thirty men and forty women. They sit in one-five semesters or around 19-21 years old. The selfefficacy scale in question is academic self-efficacy that measures the level of self-confidence of
students in their academic affairs on campus. The self-efficacy scale used is a scale modified from
the academic self-efficacy scale compiled by Bandura(2006) and Pajares (2002). This scale is used
to determine quantitatively the level of academic self-confidence of students at State Islamic
Institute (IAIN) of Kendari. From here, we can find out how the influence of language style on
student academic self-efficacy at IAIN Kendari.
4. Findings and Discussion
Each has a different style with other individuals especially in communication in essence. The
difference would seem from the language style component containing locutions acts, illocutionary
acts, and perlocution acts. As a perlocution act, lecturers’ language style had an impact on selfefficacy of the students.
There are four styles of lecturers’ language based on sentence structures, such as climax
style, oxymoron style, sarcasm language style, stylistics simile. Climax style is a style which its
quality, quantity, and intensity of the sentence are progressively increasing. Oxymoron is a style
which has a contradiction between its parts. Sarcasm is a style of expressing upset and angry by
using rude words. Simile language style is a style that comparing one thing with another thing and
always uses comparison (Keraf, 2006; Batmang et al., 2018). Based on the interviewing with the
students, this research finds that climax and oxymoron style include positive language style.
Meanwhile, sarcasm and simile language style include negative language style. The psychological
states of the students, particularly their self-efficacy can be influenced by both positive and
negative language style.
The following explanation relates with quantitative data of some influences factors towards
the language style of the lecturers to self-efficacy of the students on higher education of Indonesia.
This would seem from data normality test, data linearity, linear regression analysis and coefficient
of test determination.

Table 1 shows that the lecturers 'language style data and students' self-efficacy are obtained sig

Based on the linearity test of this research data as presented in table 2, it is known that the
significance value of deviation from linearity in the independent variable (lecturer language style)
with the dependent variable (student academic efficacy) is 0.419. Thus, it can be stated that the
significance value of the variable of this study is greater than α = 0.05, it can be explained that the
regression line of the variable is linear so that it can be a parameter to predict the size of the
student's academic self-efficacy variable. Hypothesis testing is used to calculate the magnitude of
the influence of the lecturer language style on student academic self-efficacy at IAIN Kendari. The
outputs used to test the hypothesis are briefly presented in the table below.

The results of the analysis in table 3, the path coefficient values obtained are -0.484 and sig values.
0,000 is smaller than the value of α = 0.05, then H0 is rejected, which means that the language
style of the lecturer influences the student's academic self-efficacy. The referred influence is
negative, means that the higher the negative language style developed by the lecturer, the student's
academic self-efficacy will decrease further, and conversely, the lower the negative language style
used by the lecturer, the student's academic self-efficacy can be better or increase. Furthermore, to
get the coefficient of determination or the magnitude of the contribution of lecturer language style
variables to student academic self-efficacy, it is shown in the table of determinant coefficients as
follows:

Based on table 4, the coefficient of determination shows that the magnitude of the contribution of
lecturer language style variables to academic self-efficacy is 23.5% and the rest is influenced by
other factors not related to this study. Based on the results of the test the mean difference between
the value of self-efficacy in the class and the self-efficacy value of working on the assignment
shows that there are significant differences between the two. The mean difference test results found
that the self-efficacy p-value (Sig.) In the class was 0.00> 0.05. So, it can be stated that there are
differences in the average of self-efficacy in the classroom with self-efficacy working on the task
where self-efficacy in the class is lower (66.45) than self-efficacy working on the task (69.01).
This research confirms that the lecturer's language style influences the academic selfefficacy of students. The variable language style of lecturers contributes 23.5% to students’
academic self-efficacy. This means that the language style of lecturers who tend to be positive can
motivate and empower students' abilities, while negative language styles can weaken student's selfefficacy. This research is supported by the theory of Pajares (2002) which explains that negative
language styles are generally easier to decrease self-efficacy than to strengthen it through
encouragement through a positive language style. The results of this study support the results of
previous studies about the positive relationship between academic climate and student
/student/learner self-efficacy. Like Kinanti's (2014) study, the more positive the classroom climate,
the higher the students' self-efficacy, the more negative the class climate, the lower the student's
self-efficacy. Academic climate consists of elements relating to the teacher/lecturer, the subjects
themselves (subjects), structuring the classroom environment and physical condition of the class
along with the availability of facilities. Especially for the teacher elements, it is closely related to
skills of teaching, the qualities of personal, students and teacher knowledge relationship (AbdElmotaleb & Saha, 2013). The relation between lecturers and students becomes an important
source for the formation of academic self-efficacy. Through lectures, students can assess their
abilities in attending their lectures and doing assignments properly. Verbal expressions are one of
the useful things in the formation of student academic self-efficacy in this study. Positive sentences
can increase students 'academic self-efficacy and vice versa sentences and negative word choices

(disparaging, negative labels) with certain emotional expressions (anger) can reduce students'
academic self-efficacy.
Bandura and Wessels (1997) propose efficacy beliefs rather than a generalized expectancy.
As the finding of the study of Tschannen-Moran & Hoy (2007) which show that the contextual
factors available in the school environment such as verbal persuasion and the availability of
sources of social support influence the self-efficacy of prospective teachers in the study. Thus,
student self-efficacy can also be closely related to several special conditions that exist in the
campus environment such as campus climate, campus/class leadership, and relationships between
people on campus including relations between lecturers and students. Lecturer and student
relations are closely linked to verbal communication that occurs during the lecture. This is evident
in this study that the sentences delivered by lecturers in the class provide a significant role in the
formation of student academic self-efficacy in attending lectures. There are variations in the
academic self-efficacy level of students in each class they follow.
On the other hand, there have been some researchers prove and support the contribution of
self-efficacy beliefs towards second language acquisition. For example, Magogwe and Oliver
(2007) state that self-efficacy beliefs connecting to the learning of language mediate the impact of
other influential factors, namely aptitude or previous achievement, on the next performance. In the
context of teaching English as a second and foreign language course, it is found that if a student
has a high self-efficacy beliefs, he or she is confident about their achievement, set himself or
herself challenges and is committed to achieving them, work harder to avoid failure, is highly
resilient, and connected failure with the less of effort or deficient knowledge and skills that he
or she believes he or she is capable of achieving (Bensalem, 2018; Saleem, Ali & Ab Rashid,
2018). of particular relevance to the current research is a research by Lamboy (2003), who found
that one of the things that can give a positive input students’ self-efficacy beliefs is the design of
an online learning environment to motivate different styles of learning (e.g., visual, kinesthetic,
etc.) in learning a language. This implies that the technology use such as those described in Table
1 collaborated with effective instructional design, could be a good way to increase the student's
self-efficacy beliefs.
5. Conclusion
This research shows that the language style of the lecturer plays an important role in the formation
of the self-efficacy of his students. A good relationship between lecturers and students requires
good verbal communication. For students, the role of assessment/belief in one's own abilities is as
important as the ability itself. The success of students in college, not only based on the
ability/intelligence they have. Self-efficacy is not related to a number of knowledge and abilities
that a person has but is related to what someone believes or believes about what can be done with
the knowledge and skills he or she has in a situation such as meeting academic demands if he is a
student. Because of the beliefs that can be manipulated, the four self-efficacy sources, mastery
experiences, vicarious learning, social persuasion should be managed well including providing
good persuasion through the lecturers' language style in the form of conveying good verbal
communication for their students. Further research can investigate the correlation between
lecturers’ language style and students’ performance and motivation.
