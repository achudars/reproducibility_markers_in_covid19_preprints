Abstract
Understanding the interspecific relationships for proper management of an ideal fishery system, food, and
feeding habits of fishes are prerequisites. The food and feeding habits including types and amount of feed and
seasonal pattern of feeding were studied. 168 Aspidoparia morar were collected from the River Padma,
Rajshahi, Bangladesh from May to December, 2011. The relationship between total length and alimentary canal
length was tested using OLS regression. Qualitative as well as quantitative analyses of stomach and gut contents
of each fish were done by percentage of occurrence and point method and fullness of stomach was measured by
fullness index method. Aspidoparia morar was omnivorous due to the presence of both phytoplankton
(Chlorophyceae, Euglenophyceae, Bacillariophyceae, Cyanophyceae) and zooplankton (Rotifera, Crustacea) in
the gut content. Based on the point method, the average percentage of phytoplankton and zooplankton was
80.71% and 19.29%, respectively. The highest average percentage of fullness was 72.62% in October whereas
the lowest was 56.55% in December. The highest average percentage of emptiness recorded was 43.45% in
December and the lowest was 27.38% in October. Total length was found statistically positively significant
(P0.01) with the alimentary canal length. Overall, the article concludes that Aspidoparia morar is an omnivore
with a higher feeding preference for phytoplankton and the food habits change with the seasons based on the
qualitative and quantitative analysis of food.
Key words: Food and feeding habit, fullness of stomach, emptiness of stomach, feeding intensity, plankton
Introduction
Aspidoparia morar is an indigenous small fish that belongs to the cyprinidae family, attaining a maximum
length of 17.50 cm (Chaudhry, 2010), and is widely distributed in Bangladesh, India, Iran, Myanmar, Nepal,
Pakistan, and Thailand (Talwar and Jhingran, 1991). It is known as Morari in Bangladesh, Aspidaparie indická
in Czech Rep., Aspidoparia in India, Chakale, and Karangi in Nepal (Froese and Pauly, 2012).
Aspidoparia morar is found in streams, rivers, and ponds in plains and mountainous regions. Aspidoparia morar
is a major source of animal protein and micronutrients in the diet of rural small-scale farmers (Ross et al., 2003;
Hossain et al., 2009). This fish is normally cooked and eaten whole, and its effect on the diet is further enhanced
since the bones are rich in calcium (Thilsted et al., 1997). Moreover, Aspidoparia morar is also extensively used
as an ornamental fish (Chaudhry, 2010). Formerly abundant in rivers and streams of Bangladesh, Aspidoparia
morar populations have seriously declined due to over exploitation augmented by various ecological changes,
degradation of the natural habitats, and destructive fishing methods (Chaudhry, 2010; Hossain et al., 2012a).
The knowledge of food and feeding habit helps to select species that produce maximum yield by utilizing all the
available potential food of the water bodies without competition (Dewan et al., 1985). The food and feeding
habits of fish vary with the time of the day, season, size of fish, various ecological factors, and different food
substances present in the water body (Hynes, 1950).
There are only a few studies have been conducted on Aspidoparia morar including reproduction (Breder and
Rosen, 1966), first feeding and survival (Malhotra and Munshi, 1985), length-length and length-weightrelationship (Hossain et al., 2009; Hossain, 2010), size at first sexual maturity, condition factor, spawning
season, and fecundity (Hossain et al., 2012b). Moreover, no studies have been reported on food and feeding of
Aspidoparia morar in Bangladeshi waters. Therefore, this study aims to describe the food and feeding habit of
Aspidoparia morar in the Padma River.

Material and Methods
This study collected the fish sample of Aspidoparia morar from the Talaimari ghat of Motihar Thana to
Bulonpur ghat of Rajpara Thana under the Rajshahi district of the Padma River from May to December 2011.
The river is internationally known as the 'Ganges' in the upstream of slow bound Himalayans at 7000 meters
above sea level. It enters Bangladesh from India through the Nawabgang district (Latitude 24° 50' N; Longitude
88° 26' E).
The specimens of the selected fish species were collected by fash jal and Jaki jal. The fresh samples were
immediately chilled in ice on site and fixed with 10% buffered formalin upon arrival at the laboratory to prevent
further digestion of food materials and to stop the enzymatic activities of the gut contents. In the laboratory,
fishes were washed, cleaned and total length and alimentary canal length of each fish was measured in cm and
the fishes were dissected vertically from mouth to anus. Stomach contents were observed and identified under
the microscope.
For identification of the food organisms, Ward and Whipple (1959) and Prescott (1962 and 1964) were
consulted. The stomach contents were analyzed by the point’s method and fullness of stomach was measured
using the fullness index method (Hynes, 1950). The stomachs were classified into full, ¾ full, ½ full, ¼ full and
empty. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of food were done using both the point’s method and the percentage
of frequency of occurrence method.
The number of fish in which each food group occurred was listed as percentage of the total number of fish
examined according to the percentage of frequency of occurrence method (Dewan and Saha, 1979). The volume
of stomach contents as estimated by observation was recorded on an absolute scale. Points were allotted to each
stomach according to the volume of its contents based on the point’s method (Hynes, 1950). The stomach with
the largest volume was allotted 100 points and each of the stomachs as examined was then rated in one of the
following points categories: 0, 3, 6, 12, 25, 50 and 100 points, based on the volume of food present. The
categories were based on inspection and estimation. However, a set of standards of all the point categories were
made from extra stomachs and were needed in relating absolute volumes to assign point values. Stomach with
intermediate quantities of food was allotted to the point’s category which they most nearly approached.
All the data were subjected to the ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) using the computer software, SPSS
(Statistical Package for Social Science). The relationship between total length and alimentary canal length was
tested using the OLS regression. Descriptive statistics such as, average percentage and tabular technique, were
done to calculate the length weight relationship, types and amount of food, and seasonal pattern of feeding.
Result and Discussion
Types and amount of food taken by fish
A variety of food groups were found during the analysis of stomach contents of Aspidoparia morar. A total of 6
groups were identified from the stomach of the fishes examined of which 4 belonged to phytoplankton and 2
belonged to zooplankton (Figure 1).

Figure 1: Composition of diet of fish in percentage of occurrence and total points
Among the phytoplankton, Chlorophyceae was the most dominant food group by the percentage of total points
(24.34%) followed by Euglenophyceae (24.09%), Bacillareophyceae (21.81%), Cyanophyceae (10.47%),
Crustacea (10.35%), and Rotifera (9.09%) (Table 1).

Shafiqul (2000) studied the food and feeding habit of Dhela (Osteobrama cotio cotio) and reported that by
percentage of total points, Chlorophyceae (60.47%) and Bacillariophyceae (17.57%) were the main food items.
The next preferred food items were Cyanophyceae (8.49%) followed by Euglenophyceae (6.49%), Crustacea
(4.60%), Rotifera (1.67%), and Benthos (0.73%) occupied the successive position. However, not all the food
groups were found to occur in all the stomachs of fish with food. For this finding, it can be concluded that the
fish Aspidoparia morar is an omnivore in all the size groups of fish. The fish also showed some changes in the
patterns of feeding, as they grow big. Hossain et al. (2012) and Keast (1965) reported that many fishes changed
diet as they grow. Shafiqur (2003) studied the seasonal variations of food and feeding ecology of a freshwater
small fish chela (Chela cachius) in a large reservoir pond in Bangladesh and reported that among phytoplankton,
Chlorophyceae was the dominant group followed by Bacillariophyceae and among the zooplankton, rotifera was
found more than crustaceans.
Feeding intensity (Fullness and vacuity) of Aspidoparia morar
Fishes with full, ¾ full and ½ full were considered to feed actively and fishes with ¼ full were considered to
feed poorly and vacuity was considered to feed very poorly or not at a feeding stage. In the month of October,
2011, total highest fullness of stomach was found to be 72.43% and total lowest fullness of stomach was found
to be 56.55% in December, 2011. In the month of December, 2011 total highest vacuity of stomach was found
to be 43.45 and the total lowest vacuity of stomach was found to be 27.38% in October (Table 2). From the
present study, it can be concluded that the fish changes its food habit with the change of months.

These findings are more or less similar to those of Dewan and Saha (1979) who reported that Tilapia nilotica
changed its food habit with the changes in seasons. Alam et al. (2002) and Dasgupta (1990) stated that the
feeding intensity of Tor tor increased with the increase in size. Higher feeding percentage was also recorded
among young individuals of Tor putitora. Thomas (1969) stated that low feeding activity might not be due to
shortage of food items but due to the spawning season of the fish. Hossain et al. (2012) and Hynes (1950)
observed that the fish have adapted to a wide variety of food. Some fishes are herbivorous, carnivorous and
omnivorous and also plankton feeders. Variation occurs in the food of fishes throughout the year. Monthly
changes in temperature not only influenced food composition and the rate of digestion but also the quantity and
quality of various foods.
Occurrence Method
Bacillariophyceae was found to be the highest at 100% in the stomach in July and December, 2011 and lowest at
20% in May, 2011. Chlorophyceae was found to be the highest at 100% in the stomach in May, June and
September 2011 and lowest at 50% in August, October and December, 2011. Cyanophyceae was found to be the
highest at 100% in the stomach in August, October and November, 2011 and lowest at 35% in May, 2011.
Euglenophyceae was found to be the highest at 60% in the stomach in December, 2011 and lowest at 30% in
June and October, 2011. Crustacea was found to be the highest at 30% in the stomach in November, 2011 and
lowest at 15% in September, 2011. Rotifera was found to be the highest at 60% in the stomach in May, August,
October, and November 2011 and lowest at 50% in June, 2011 (Table 3).

Point’s method
The stomach contents of Aspidoparia morar consisted of six broad groups namely Bacillariophyceae,
Chlorophyceae, Cyanopyceae, Euglenophyceae, Crustacea, and Rotifera and variations of these food items were
consumed during different months of the study period. The average number of Bacillariophyceae was 21.81% of
the stomach contents during the research period. During this period, maximum number of 22.72% was recorded
in October, 2011 and the minimum of 20.63% in August, 2011. The average number of Chlorophyceae was

Relationship between total length (TL) and alimentary canal length (ACL)
Mathematical relationship between total length (TL) and alimentary canal length (ACL) was established from
the observed data and the values of regressions, correlation-efficient, point of intercepts, and standard deviation
were computed (Table 5) using the statistical formula according to Simpson (1951). The results showed that
total length was positive and significant (P0.01) with the alimentary canal length.

Conclusion
Based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis of food of the fish, it can be concluded that, Aspidoparia
morar is an omnivore with a higher feeding preference for phytoplankton. The feeding activity of the fish was
found to vary with total length (TL) and alimentary canal length (ACL). Aspidoparia morar was found to
change its feeding activity with the change in season and they were more active during winter compared to
summer. The fish showed two feeding peaks; the major one was in winter and the minor one was in late
summer. It was found to change its food habits with the change in seasons.
