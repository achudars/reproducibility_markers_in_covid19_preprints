Integrating Ethical Values into Fraud Triangle Theory in Assessing Employee Fraud:
Evidence from the Malaysian Banking Industry
Abstract
This study attempts to integrate ethical values into the fraud triangle theory in the context of
Malaysian banking industry. Primary data were collected through the survey of 108
questionnaires administered to the employees of the top three largest banks in Malaysia. The
findings revealed that ethical values were negatively related to employee fraud, and two elements
of fraud triangle theory, namely, opportunity and rationalization, were positively related to
employee fraud. This implies that high ethical value is crucial to mitigate employee fraud. To
minimize employee fraud, the banking industry should reduce opportunities and employee
negative rationalization through strong internal control. This study contributes to literature on the
occurrences of employee fraud, which is not widely discussed, especially in the context of the
banking industry in developing countries.
Keywords: Fraud triangle theory, Banking sector, Ethical value, Malaysia
Introduction
Fraud is an act committed by a party or an individual for the intention of getting benefits,
avoiding obligation, or causing financial or non-financial loss to another party (Ruin, 2009).
Fraud is normally committed by perpetrators for personal benefit (Kennedy, 2012). The
Association of Certified Fraud Examiners (ACFE) reported fraud incidents from which 36.6%
occur in the banking sector and 17.8% in the financial services with an average loss of $200,000
(ACFE, 2014). According to KPMG (2013), the common organizational frauds relate to the
cases of misappropriation of assets, misrepresentation of financial statements, theft of funds, and
corruption, as well as computer-related, identity, consumer-related, and supply chain frauds.
The growing number of employee fraud is a great concern that can negatively impact
balance sheets, client confidence, and staff morale (Ramazani & Atani, 2010; Skousen & Wright,
2006). Bank failures are as old as the banking industry itself. The Dictionary of Economics and
Commerce reported that 200 banks had failed in England within 35 years, between 1815 and
1850. The failure is attributed mainly to employee fraud (Dickens et al., 1989). Employee fraud
reduces the confidence of outside investors and the stability of the capital market. These
instances in turn have highly impacted the growth and development of the economy, especially
in the developing countries (Chen et al., 2013; Rezaee, 2005; Albrecht et al., 2010; Akindele,
2011). Scholars generally agree that employee fraud in banking continues to be a major concern
for organizations of all sizes and across all regions (PWC, 2005; Klein, 2015). PWC (2005)
examined the prevalence of misconduct across the industries. The survey showed that 71% of
employees who work in banking were reported to have had “personally seen” or had “first-hand
knowledge” of misconduct within their organization over the past 12 months. Apparently, a
major portion of employee fraud cases is found in the banking sector.
Criminologists agree that fraud is caused by three elements. According to the conceptual
theory by Cressey in the 1950s, the three essential elements in fraud occurrences are opportunity,
2

pressure, and rationalization. Subsequently, many studies have tested Cressey‟s fraud theory,
which has been conceptualized as the “fraud triangle.” Although Cressey‟s fraud triangle has
been supported by regulators, critics such as (Albercht et al., 1984; Wolfe & Hermanson, 2004;
Kranacher et al., 2010; Kassem & Higson, 2012) have insisted that this concept will be
insufficient as a tool for observing, deterring, and avoiding fraud. Thus, integration of other
elements into the fraud triangle theory is necessary as fraud deterrence mechanism.
Ethical value has received much attention, especially after the highly publicized cases of
Enron and WorldCom. Such cases negatively affect the economy of a country as a whole (Baker
and Andrews, 2006). In the non-financial sector, ethical values are not as important as in banking
which plays a crucial part in the infrastructure of the global economy, and the issues of
trustworthiness provide large implications to a country (Hartman et al., 2014). Mauritius Bankers
Association Limited (2013) supported this notion by identifying strong ethical value as a
cornerstone of the banking industry in performing their business. Ethical values play a significant
role in reducing the likelihood of employee fraud in workplace (Cassell et al., 1997). Ziegenfuss
(1996) proposed a fraud triangle theory to include ethical value implication as a reaction to the
employee fraud.
In the case of Malaysia, banks suffered losses amounting to RM 789 million (185 million
USD) between 2008 and 2013 due to fraud. Frequent financial frauds committed by employees
include withdrawal of money from inactive accounts of customers, abuse of customer overdraft
facilities, and failure to credit cash deposit into customer accounts (Bernama, 2016) 1. In a recent
case involving fraudulent misconduct committed by an employee of a bank, the bank employee
is now facing 12 charges of theft of $35,000 (RM 110,600). The case involved money being
transferred from accounts of customers who were victims of the MH370 tragedy (Menezes,
2014).
The Global Economic Crime Survey by PWC discussed the most common types of
employee fraud occurrence in the banking industry and their percentage of occurrences as
follows: asset misappropriation (69%), procurement fraud (29%), bribery and corruption (27%),
cybercrime (24%), and fraudulent financial statement (22%) (PWC, 2014, p.6). Malaysia had
reported the total value of fraud amounting to RM63.95 million in 2009 (KPMG Malaysia,
2009). Based on the total value of fraud disclosed, 87% came from employee fraud occurrence,
which were internally perpetrated by management and non-management sectors. This result is
consistent with that in 2004.
Currently, studies on employee fraud occurrence in the banking industry are not given
adequate attention by researchers. Past studies on fraud have focused on financial statement
fraud (Rezaee, 2005; Hooper & Forneli, 2010) and public sector fraud (Sanusi et al., 2015; Bakri
et al., 2015) in developed countries (Smith, 2005; KPMG, 2010). Therefore, this study aims to
contribute to literature by integrating the ethical value aspect into the fraud triangle theory in the
context of Malaysian banking industry. This study proposes that three elements of fraud triangle

theory, namely, pressure, opportunity, and rationalization, increases fraud occurrence, whereas
ethical values can mitigate fraud occurrence among bank employees.
Literature Review and Hypothesis Development
Pressure and Occurrence of Employee Fraud
Fraud investigators define “pressure” as a non-observable element. This definition is particularly
true for auditors who may not recognize the symptoms associated with pressure because they
have often limited interactions with potential perpetrators and lack a baseline from which to
evaluate current behavior (Coenen, 2007). Moreover, Hasnan et al. (2008) defined pressure in
the case of financial frauds as pressure from the outside environment to meet a certain earning
target, or an individually generated desire to achieve a specific financial target to earn points.
Skousen and Wright (2006) examined the role of the fraud triangle elements in detecting
and predicting fraud cases. Financial stability, external pressure, personal financial needs, and
financial targets have each presented pressure as the element that may be involved in the
category of fraud risk factors (Skousen & Wright, 2006).
Pressure or incentive elements will result in managers or employees committing fraud.
Several researchers have found a significant relationship between pressure and fraud occurrence
(Rezaee, 2005; Albrecht et al., 2010; Akindele, 2011). An individual employee will tend to
commit fraud if elements of pressure, whether financial or non-financial, exist (Murdock, 2008).
A survey conducted by ACFE in 2013 showed 42% of fraud activity resulted from personal
financial and organization pressure (KPMG Malaysia, 2013). This finding is unanimously
supported by research conducted by Abdul Rahman et al., (2016).
Dellaportas (2013) and Shelton (2014) argued that pressure plays a vital role in
increasing the likelihood of fraud occurrence among bank employees. However, financial
pressures may appear different depending on the position of the employee. For example, a
cashier may be under personal pressure that is aligned with the motive, whereas the pressure for
a manager can be meeting the target as priority compared with financial pressure. This
relationship is explained further by Vinten (2003), who noted that the CEO of a company may
commit fraud to show escalating profits or to avoid disclosing certain liabilities in the financial
statements as have been done in the Enron case. Thus, in the present study, the following
relationship was hypothesized:
H1: A positive relationship exists between pressure and employee fraud in the Malaysian
banking industry.

Opportunity and Occurrence of Employee Fraud
Opportunities exist when no surveillance or monitoring practices are implemented, or when
weaknesses are indicated in the part of management to prevent opportunities for potential
fraudsters (Ramos, 2003). Opportunity provides a chance to fraudsters to commit fraud. Many
4

scholars (Albrecht et al., 2010; Murdock, 2008; Lister, 2007; Kassem et al., 2012; Manurung &
Hadian, 2013; Dellaportas, 2013) believe that opportunity is a very significant factor that
contributes to fraud and other fraudulent activities behavior, such as embezzlement and loan
manipulation, which are mostly caused by lack of internal control within the organization.
In addition, Rae and Subramaniam (2008) agreed that opportunity may generally be
caused by weaknesses in the internal controls. Inadequate supervision, poor separation of duties,
lack of management approval, or weak system control are examples that may provide
opportunities that may result in fraud among employees (Sanusi et al., 2015). Vona (2012)
identified lack of internal control as a factor that can create an opportunity as a risk assessment
tool on human resources. Undeniably, opportunity can lead to intention that influences or causes
someone to commit fraud.
Meanwhile, the probability of an employee to be caught is small due to the presence of
opportunity in the company and leads to employees being exposed to risks of committing fraud
(Cressey, 1953; Coleman, 1987; Wells, 2001; Chen et al., 2007, Lister, 2007). The findings of
past studies are consistent with those of the survey conducted by PWC in 2011, which revealed
opportunities, such as lack of internal control and inadequate segregation of duties, motivate
employee to conduct fraudulent activities. Unfortunately, not many empirical studies are
available in the context of banking industries.
In the KPMG Malaysia Fraud, Bribery, and Corruption 2013 survey, most influential
opportunities presented in the workplace can lead to fraud occurrence. According to the survey,
the most influential opportunities are loopholes in internal control, inadequate competency to
detect fraud by the internal audit team, insufficient training to give awareness on fraud, nature of
that particular industry prone to fraud, and failure to convey organizational code of ethics and
values with 81%, followed by bad examples portrayed by upper level staff with 43%, and poor
ethical culture within the organization with 38% (KPMG, 2013). Thus, the following relationship
was hypothesized:
H2: A positive relationship exists between opportunity and employee fraud in the
Malaysian banking industry.
Rationalization and Occurrence of Employee Fraud
Rationalization is defined as a way to legitimize a manner or concept that is incompatible with
one‟s belief (Slezak, 2013). For example, employees who commit fraudulent financial statements
may believe that their actions are in the best interest of the firms. Another example occurs when
certain employees justify they have no choice but to engage in criminal acts (Cromwell &
Thurman, 2003). According to Tsang (2002), rationalization happens when the ability of a
person causes him or her to reinterpret his or her deprived and wicked actions as morally
acceptable.
Rationalization is a major factor that contributes to fraud (Kula et al., 2011). Cressey
believes that an individual, who is a first time offender with no criminal experience, has his or
her own justification to support his or her action. Therefore, these offenders are merely people
5

who have found themselves entangled in difficult situations (Cressey, 1953). This finding is
supported by the results of a survey conducted by KPMG in 2011 in Singapore. The results
showed evidence that most first-time fraudsters rationalize their actions and do not view
themselves as criminals.
According to ACFE, people tend to rationalize a criminal activity before they decide to
commit the crime (ACFE, 2014). In their study, ACFE revealed that fraud in government,
employees, or organizations will usually rationalize their conduct of corruption in many ways,
which allow them to “innocently” carry out the act. They will tend to use excuses, such as
“bribery is our country‟s culture,” “we have no idea that the behavior is considered bribe,” “we
are doing this as usual,” and “there is no other way to complete this.”
Murphy and Dacin (2011) examined several motives that contribute to fraud occurrences
among three different groups, which had evidence of fraud, perused publication on fraud, and
committed fraud revealed. The findings showed that internal cultures of firms directly impact the
occurrence of fraud as they present several motives and rationalizations.
Fraudsters rationalize fraud in many ways. For example, when employees steal cash from
the company, they rationalize their fraudulent actions by justifying that they are only borrowing
the money from the company. Other than that belief, employees rationalize their fraudulent
actions by justifying that “they are only borrowing from company not stealing from their boss”
(KPMG, 2003). A global economic crime survey conducted by PWC in 2011 showed 12% of the
participants believe in people‟s rationale to provide excuses for their actions as the largest risk of
fraud (PWC, 2011). In conclusion, when rationalization is present in a workplace, the tendency
to commit fraud will increase. Thus, the following relationship was hypothesized:
H3: A positive relationship exists between rationalization and employee fraud in the
Malaysian banking industry.
Ethical Values and Occurrence of Employee Fraud
Ethics can be defined as the agreed on standards of what is desirable and undesirable and of right
and wrong conduct or behavior of a person, group, or entity (Cressy et al., 2010). Laczniak (1993)
referred to ethics as acts that guide employees on the basis of moral and behavioral principles.
Moreover, Ambrose et al. (2008) viewed ethical values as overall values embraced by
individuals and organizations. Individual ethical values are influenced by behavior and what is
thought to be right or wrong. Meanwhile, Irianto et al. (2009) referred to ethical values as being
honest by following company policies and procedures. With ethical values present within
themselves, any fraudulent activity may be restricted given that employees strongly believe in
what is wrong and right. Mathenge (2014) examined ethical values among enforcement
employees, who are found to be easily exposed to corruption. Hence, high ethical values
(competence, confidence, and professionalism) will reduce the likelihood of fraudulent activities
by employees in performing their job.
The existence and compliance of ethical values among employees can reduce fraud
occurrence in organizations (Haron et al., 2011; Zandstra, 2002). For example, the Enron case
6

became a point on the significance of ethical value existence. Zandstra (2002) stated that the
collapse of Enron is attributed mainly to the failure of ethical responsibility. Ethical values can
be established by developing and strengthening a set of ethics codes, training, top management
support, compliance, and other specific ethics programs, such as hotlines, ethics groups, and
staffing ethics officials (Andreoli & Lefkowitz, 2009).
Several studies have examined the influence of ethical values on behavior and job
conduct of employees (Hunt et al., 1989). Scholars propose that ethical values may reduce the
tendency of employees to commit fraud (Irianto et al., 2009; Dikolli, 2012). Thus, with ethical
values embraced by a company, employees will naturally give favorable responses with healthy
attitudes toward work and beneficial conduct (Baker & Andrews, 2006; Hunt et al. 1989).
People who have established strong ethical values are attributed to exhibit ethical and
integrity behavior (Rockness & Rockness, 2005). Furthermore, with ethical values, the action
employees encourage critical judgment in decision making (Zahra, 2007). Chen et al. (2013)
found that employees lacking in ethical values will tend to conduct bribery and corruption. In
addition, executives lacking in ethical values will tend to ignore policies and procedures to
pursue their self-interests. Therefore, unethical decisions and fraudulent behavior will be likely
to flourish among less ethical employees. Thus, the following relationship was hypothesized:
H4: A negative relationship exists between ethical values and employee fraud in the
Malaysian banking industry.
Methodology
Sampling and Data Collection
A total of 600 questionnaires were distributed to bank employees at their respective Academic
Learning Centers located in Bangi, Selangor. Respondents were given 20 minutes to fill in the
questionnaire and drop the questionnaires into the box provided. Out of 600 questionnaires
distributed, 108 were returned. Responses were measured on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from
strongly agree to strongly disagree.
This study was conducted among employees of three largest banks in Malaysia, which
were denoted as Bank A, Bank B, and Bank C. The main criterion for selecting the three banks
was based on their total asset size and market capitalization in Malaysia in 2015, as indicated by
Forbes and Bursa Malaysia (2015).
o Bank A: Bank A was established in 1960 and offers a full range of commercial,
corporate, and private banking services with a network more than 450 branch offices
and more than 2,500 Automated teller machines (ATMs). Apart from operating in
Malaysia, Bank A also operates in Singapore, Brunei, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea,
Vietnam, New York, London, and China. With 45,000 employees, Bank A has
USD 183.13 billion in total asset size and USD 24.5 billion in market capitalization.
7

o Bank B: Bank B was established in 1965 and offers a full range of consumer banking,
corporate banking, investment banking, Islamic banking, asset management, insurance,
and takaful. The network has more than 1,080 branches over 18 countries. With 40,000
employees, Bank B is the second largest bank in Malaysia with USD 118.56 billion in
total asset size and USD 14.5 billion in market capitalization.
o Bank C: Bank C was established in 1966 and focuses on financial services including
personal banking, commercial banking, Islamic banking, investment banking, share
broking, trustee services, nominee services, sale and management of unit trust funds,
banccassurance, and general insurance products. Bank C has a network of 259 branches
and 1,801 ATMs. Its presence in the Asia Pacific region has a network of 1 subsidiary
each in Hong Kong (83 branches), Cambodia (27 branches), and Vietnam (7 branches),
4 branches in Laos, 3 branches in China, and 3 branches in Sri Lanka. With more than
35,000 employees, Bank C has USD 98.88 billion in total asset size and
USD 20.4 billion in market capitalization.
Therefore, the employees of the three banks were deemed suitable as respondents in the present
study.
Measurement of Variables
This study measured pressure by eight items that were adopted and modified from Wolfe and
Hermanson (2004), Rezaee (2005), Kassem and Higson (2012), and Dellaportas (2013).
Moreover, eight items on opportunity were designed to measure the level of weaknesses in the
work environment that could create opportunities for employee fraud occurrence by adopting
from Wolfe and Hermanson (2004), Din (2008), Kassem and Higson (2012), and Delllaportas
(2013). With modifications to reflect bank employee working culture and working environment,
eight items on rationalization were adopted from Marquet (2011), Tugas (2012), Kassem and
Higson (2012), and Dellaportas (2013). Furthermore, eight items in the questionnaire were
adopted with modifications from Galbraith and Stephenson (1993), Davis et al. (2001), and
Kalshoven et al. (2011), which were designed to measure ethical values. Finally, eight items
were designed to measure the level of an employee fraud in the banking industry based on
Wilson (2004), Holtfrefer (2004), Din (2008), and Marquet (2011). All of these items are
available in the Appendix.
Model and Statistical Test
The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and cross-sectional
regression. Initially, validity of the data was tested through several standard diagnostic
procedures. The adequacy of data was tested by Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin test, normality of data was
tested by skewness and kurtosis analysis, and homoscedasticity of data was tested by F-test and
Bartlett Sphericity test. Correlation analysis was carried out to check multicollinearity problem.
Finally, the reliability of the data was tested using Cronbach‟s alpha test.

Result and Finding
Demographic Information
The survey showed that 35.2% (38) respondents were male and 64.8% (70) were female (Table
1). Most of the respondents (35.2%, 38) were 30 years old and below, and in the 31–40 age
group category (38.9%, 42), while the rest was in the 41–50 (18.5%, 20) age group category, and
50 years old and above (7.4%, 8). This result indicated that the majority of the participants in this
study comprised female bank employees and the age of the participants fell into the 31–40 age
group category. In terms of marital status, 29.6% (32) respondents were single, 66.7% (72) were
married, 2.8% (3) were divorced, and 0.9% (1) was widowed. These data showed that the
majority of the respondents were married employees or had been previously married.

The results indicated that most of the bank employees in this study were educated until
tertiary education, with 48.1% (52) degree holders. The next highest category of respondents was
Diploma holders with 24.1% (26), followed by “O” level and other certificate holders with
17.6% (19). A small percentage of bank employees had postgraduate degrees of either master or
doctorate qualifications with 9.3% (10). Only one respondent (0.9%) had a professional
certificate.
More than half of the respondents (61.1%, 66) worked at the operational level and
management staff, while the remaining 38.9% (42) were from the sales department. The majority
of the respondents had at least 1 year or more experience as 45.4% (49) respondents were in the
category of 1–5 years of experience, followed by 38% (41) who had more than 10 years, and
14.8% (16) between 6 to 10 years of experience. Only 2 (1.8%) respondents had worked less
than one year. With regard to salary, the majority of the respondents were earning RM 2,000 to
RM 5,000 (50.9%, 55) and RM5001 to RM10000 (23.1%, 25). Only 11.1% (12) were earning
more than 10,000, while 14.8% (16) were earning less than RM 2,000 per month.
Diagnostic Test
When confronted with large data set, exploratory data analysis should be conducted first prior to
the data cleaning process. As the range of skewness values for all the variables were from −1.011
to 0.223 and that of the kurtosis was from −0.365 to 0.705, all data were considered normal
(Table 2).

According to Nunally (1978) and Pallant (2007), any value of 0.70 and above will be acceptable
for good measure of internal consistency. The Cronbach‟s Alpha values for employee fraud
occurrence, opportunity, pressure, rationalization, and ethical value were recorded as high as
0.880, 0.901, 0.845, 0.851, and 0.811, respectively, which indicated good internal consistency of
data.

Correlation examines the relationship between two variables in a linear fashion (Coakes et al.,
2008). This analysis helps identify whether one variable is related to another. The two variables
are considered highly correlated to each other and explain the dependent variable, which will
cause a multicollinearity problem if the value of coefficient is 0.8 or 0.9, and above (Field,
2000). Table 3 shows the summary of the results when using bivariate analysis to test the
correlation between one variable to another. The statistical results showed that the correlation
values among the variables ranged from −0.384 to 0.426. This finding indicated multicollinearity
problem among the variables given that none of the correlation was more than 0.8.
The Bartlett Sphericity test was conducted to test homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variances.
The results showed that the values for employee fraud occurrence (Chi-square= 12322.087,
p<0.000), opportunity (Chi-square= 15201.014, df=21, p<0.000), pressure (Chi-square=
12011.066, df=21, p<0.000), rationalization (Chi- square= 12401.014, df=21, p<0.000), and
ethical value (Chi-square= 11327.037, df=78, p<0.000) were noted to be statistically significant.
The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin coefficient for these datasets was 0.788 for employee fraud
occurrence, 0.893 for opportunity, 0.804 for pressure, 0.780 for rationalization, and 0.677 for
ethical value, indicating that the data could be used to proceed with the exploratory factor
analysis (Hair et al., 2010).
Regression Analysis
The regression showed the R-squared (R2) of 0.558, which implied that the three predictor
variables (opportunity, rationalization, and ethical values) explained 55.8% of the variance in
employee fraud in the banking industry (Table 4). The F-statistic (40.031) and the corresponding
p-value were highly significant (0.000).

The first objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between pressure and
employee fraud. Thus, H1 proposed a positive relationship between pressure and employee fraud
occurrence. As shown in Table 4, hypothesis 1 was not supported because no significant
relationship was found between pressure and employee fraud occurrence (β= −0.055, t= −0.495,
p= 0.622). Although considerable previous literature has found the association between pressure
and employee fraud occurrence (e.g., Dezoort & Lord, 1994; Dirsmirth & Covaleski, 1985; Lord
& Dezoort, 2001), the results in this study showed statistically insignificant result.
Opportunity (β= 0.243, t= 2.447, p= 0.000) was found significantly and positively correlated
with employee fraud in the Malaysian banking industry. Therefore, H2 was supported.
Opportunity will be present if internal control is weak within organizations (Kassem & Higson,
2012; Wolfe & Hermanson, 2004).
Rationalization had the largest standardized beta coefficient (β= 0.465, t= 4.506, p= 0.000). This
finding indicated that rationalization made the strongest and largest contribution in explaining
employee fraud occurrence in the Malaysian banking industry. Therefore, H3 was supported.
Rationalization is an attitude that makes someone justify wrong behavior as acceptable. The
worst case is when an individual possesses a character that allows him or her to commit fraud
intentionally (Cohen et al., 2008).
The last hypothesis proposed a negative relationship between ethical values and employee fraud
occurrence. Table 4 shows that the hypothesis was supported because a significantly negative
relationship was indicated between ethical values and employee fraud occurrence (β= −0.345, t=
−3.494, p= 0.013). This finding provided another insight into ethical values and its influence on
employee fraud occurrence.

Discussion and Conclusion
The findings of this study demonstrated that opportunity, rationalization, and ethical value
significantly contributed to occurrence of fraud among bank employees of Malaysia, but pressure
had no significant influences on fraud.
The study revealed that the element of opportunity had a significant and positive impact on the
fraud occurrence among bank employees in Malaysia. In the past, much opportunity is possible
for employees to commit white collar crimes if internal control of the management is low
(Kassem & Higson, 2012; Wolfe & Hermanson, 2004). Previous studies (Dinapoli, 2008; Omar
& Din, 2010; Lou & Wang, 2011, and Dellaportas, 2013) have indicated that various elements,
such as unclear separation of roles and responsibilities, poor documentation on policies,
procedures and guidelines, insufficient physical controls by security guards, entering the
transaction in an untimely manner, unrestricted access to corporate check books, and insecure
control of cash boxes, present numerous opportunities for fraud to occur within the banking
sector. Thus, management should emphasize on policy implementation and strengthen the power
12

of internal control. One of the recommendations is the installation of CCTV in properties. This
method can help in monitoring employee activities during office hours. Through this monitored
system, employees will be aware of their actions and thus inhibit from committing fraudulent
acts. Wallis & Roselli (2015) agreed that the opportunity for employees to commit fraud can be
reduced by strengthening the internal control of organization.
This study found that rationalization was significantly and positively related to employee fraud
occurrence in the Malaysian banking industry. Rationalization has allowed individuals to justify
their actions. Rationalization is in the mindset of perpetrators who justify their fraudulent acts
(Mohamed et al., 2014). Wilson (2004) and Monica (2013) pointed out that employees may have
their own beliefs (e.g., “I‟m doing this for a good purpose,” “I‟m only borrowing money,” “This
is a return on my efforts,” “Nobody will suffer as a result of this action,” or “I have no outside
help”) that can strongly influence them to commit fraud. Organizations can promote a healthy
workplace environment through enhancement of integrity courses or provision of incentives to
employees who appear to possess high integrity as one of the preventive mechanism. Cash for
incentives for employees will not hurt as much as large losses in the form of white collar crimes.
Finally, this study found a negative relationship between ethical values and employee fraud
occurrence, thereby supporting the fourth hypothesis. Hence, high ethical values among
employees result in few employee fraud occurrences. Employees tend to comply with ethical
behavior during operations and services. Following ethical standards increases the belief among
employees that ethical practice does not depend on situation, and thus, organization should
enhance its standard code of ethics. Haron et al. (2011) agreed that the function of ethical values
as influential factor can lead to fraudulent behavior among employees. Ethical values embraced
individually can influence employees to abide by the organizational policies set by the
management and avoid breach of rules among employees.
