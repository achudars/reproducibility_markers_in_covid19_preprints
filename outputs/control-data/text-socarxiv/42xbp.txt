Abstract
Whether labor market competition is shaping anti-immigration
attitudes is a contentious issue. We conduct a novel test of ethnic
competition theory by comparing the attitudes towards immigration
of workers with fixed-term contracts to those with permanent jobs
in Europe. Fixed-term contract workers are particularly at risk of
competition as they have to compete for jobs in the foreseeable future. In the first step of our investigation, we analyze cross-sectional
data (ESS, 2002–18) from 18 Western European countries. We find
that—contrary to our expectation—fixed-term workers are less antiimmigration. The effect is substantively small. In the second step,
we use a fixed-effects design with longitudinal data from the German

The data used for our analysis are publicly available (ESS, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008,

Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP, 1999–2015) to rule out time-constant
unobserved heterogeneity. We find that transitioning from a fixedto a permanent contract does not affect anti-immigration attitudes.
Our combined results thus add to the evidence against labor market
competition as an explanation of anti-immigrant attitudes.

Introduction
As immigration takes a prominent position in public debates in many countries, understanding of the drivers of attitudes towards immigration is crucial.
Group threat theory (Blalock, 1967) is one of the most prominent approaches
to explaining anti-immigration attitudes. Its main claim is that competition
with migrants over material or symbolic resources leads to a sense of ethnic threat, which in turn results in anti-immigration attitudes. Competition
in the labor market is the focal point of studies using ethnic competition
theory. Whether these studies provide convincing support for ethnic competition theory is highly contested (e.g. Hainmueller and Hopkins, 2014). We
contribute to this debate by exploring the role of fixed-term contracts in
shaping anti-immigration attitudes.
Migrants tend to be overrepresented in low-skilled employment, thus
better-educated people are less likely to face competition from migrants
on the labor market. Better-educated individuals indeed report less ethnic threat and are less opposed to immigration (Cavaille and Marshall, 2019;
Dancygier and Donnelly, 2013; Margaryan et al., 2019; Polavieja, 2016; Scheepers et al., 2002; Schneider, 2008). However, this finding could also be explained by education being conducive to more liberal attitudes across the
board, rather than being a consequence of lower economic threat (e.g. Hainmueller and Hopkins, 2014; Hello et al., 2006; Pecoraro and Ruedin, 2016).
Studies using different ways to capture labor market competition, such as
through skill level, skill specificity (Hainmueller and Hiscox, 2007; Ortega
and Polavieja, 2012; Pardos-Prado and Xena, 2019), or sectoral dynamics
(Dancygier and Donnelly, 2013) have shown contradictory results, as have
survey experiments which elicited reactions to migration scenarios in which
migrants’ skill levels were experimentally manipulated (Hainmueller and His2

cox, 2007; Malhotra et al., 2013).
New labor market insecurities, specifically the proliferation of fixed-term
contracts, offer an innovative way to examine the merits of ethnic competition theory. Previous studies commonly focused on factors which determine
the likelihood that someone’s job can be taken up by immigrants. In European labor markets however, workers tend to be sheltered from competition
by legal constraints on wage cuts and employment termination, limiting the
competition faced by people in employment. Yet not all workers are sheltered
to the same extent. Insecure forms of employment such as fixed-term, involuntary part-time, and zero-hour contracts are becoming more prevalent in
European labor markets (European Parliament, 2016). Their marginal labor
market position makes such workers particularly vulnerable to competition.
This makes them a good test case for ethnic competition theory. Moreover,
as new labor market insecurities show a substantial, albeit varying, presence
across sectors and education groups (European Parliament, 2016; Polavieja,
2005), they allow disentangling the effects of labor market competition from
those that shape general liberal attitudes.
In this study, we will focus on the effect of fixed-term contracts. In the
member states of the European Union, the share of fixed-term contracts has
sharply increased, from about 8.6 per cent in 1985 to a peak of 14.3 per cent in
2017 (OECD, 2020b). Over the same period, this rate among 15–24 year-olds
went from 22.3 per cent to 44.2 per cent. Given a certain skill level, fixedterm contracts make workers more vulnerable to competition by immigrants,
because they can more easily be replaced than those with permanent contracts. This heightened vulnerability may lead to stronger anti-immigration
attitudes.
While fixed-term contracts generate job insecurity, whether they also increase labor market competition with migrants may depend on three factors.
Firstly, the effect may depend on whether migrants can be hired for the
position of the native fixed-term contract worker. We use sectoral share of
immigrant workers as a proxy for replaceability and examine its moderating
role on the relationship between fixed-term contracts and anti-immigration
attitudes. Secondly, the level of competition depends on the availability of
jobs. We therefore examine the moderating role of sectoral level unemploy3

ment. Thirdly, the extent to which fixed-term contracts expose people to
increased job insecurity may depend on the degree of insider–outsider segmentation in the labour market. This segmentation is driven by the level
of employment protection of fixed-term vs. permanent contracts (Polavieja,
2003; Passaretta and Wolbers, 2019). If dismissal protection for permanent
contracts is low, fixed-term contracts are only marginally less secure than
permanent ones and are unlikely to increase competition (Marx and Picot,
2020). To examine this, we check if the gap between employment protection legislation (EPL) for permanent and fixed-term contracts moderates the
relationship between fixed-term contracts and anti-immigration attitudes.
Our analyses proceeds in two steps. First, we use nine rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS, 2002–18), comparing anti-immigration attitudes
of fixed-term workers to those of workers with permanent contracts across
18 Western European countries to ensure the external validity of our findings.
We focus on Western Europe due to the strong geographic division in antiimmigrant attitudes between East and West Europe (Czaika and Di Lillo,
2018; Heath and Richards, 2020, 2019). In a second step, we make use of
longitudinal data from the German Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP, 1999–
2015) in a fixed-effects design to ensure the internal validity of our findings.
This analysis also meets calls to take a dynamic rather than static approach
to competition (Lancee and Pardos-Prado, 2013; Meuleman et al., 2009).
To preview our findings, we do not find a substantive difference in antiimmigration attitudes between fixed-term workers and permanent employees.
This finding holds across education level, social class, countries, employment
protection gap, and sectoral immigrant and unemployment levels. We thus
add to the evidence against ethnic competition theory as applied to economic competition. Further, our results imply that improving acceptance of
immigrants in societies should focus on factors other than the labor market
situation of natives, such as reducing prejudices and improving the information environment about migration in societies.

Background and hypotheses
Labor market competition and anti-immigrant attitudes
What makes individuals like or dislike immigrants? Group conflict theory is
one of the most prominent explanations used for understanding the attitudes
held about immigrants and immigration. Ethnic competition theory is based
on a synthesis of group conflict theory and social identity theory. Social identity theory holds that people have a need to belong to a high-status group.
To fulfill this need, they will assign negative characteristics to any out-group,
identify with their in-group, and see their in-group as being better than the
out-group. This happens regardless of competition over resources. Scheepers
et al. (2002) argue that group competition intensifies the process described
by social identity theory. Group conflict theory posits that competition over
resources leads to a sense of threat which in turn leads to ethnic exclusionism such as opposition to immigration (Blalock, 1967; Olzak, 1992; Scheepers
et al., 2002). Competition can take place over economic resources, such as
jobs, or symbolic resources such as national identity or language. We focus
our discussion here on competition over economic resources.
Competition can occur at the macro- as well as at the micro-level. At
the macro-level, fewer resources or more people competing over them will
increase competition, e.g. the arrival of immigrants, an economic downturn,
or the combination of the two. At the micro-level, people who hold labor
market positions similar to those taken up by immigrants experience greater
competition (Scheepers et al., 2002).
Ethnic exclusionism can be driven by actual or perceived competition.
People’s perception of competition—also known as ‘perceived threat’—may
act as a mediator between actual competition and anti-immigration attitudes (Billiet et al., 2014; Scheepers et al., 2002). Conversely, perceived
threat might be a proxy for general prejudice rather than a result of actual
competition (Hainmueller and Hopkins, 2014; Polavieja, 2016).
The relation between competition and exclusionism can be based on economic self-interest or group interest. People in positions similar to those often
taken up by migrants—e.g. working class, low educated—may display more

5

negative attitudes about immigrants because immigrants pose a threat to
their personal economic interests, such as job security or wage development
(Billiet et al., 2014; Bobo, 1988; McLaren, 2003; Polavieja, 2016; Scheve and
Slaughter, 2001; Scheepers et al., 2002). Alternatively, people in positions
similar to those of migrants may develop more negative attitudes to immigration out of concern for the interests of their group, so-called ‘sociotropic’
concerns (Hainmueller and Hopkins, 2014; McLaren, 2003). Following this
argument, people in positions similar to those of migrants are more negative
about immigration, because their position provides them with more information about the presence of an immigrant threat (Dancygier and Donnelly,
2013; Tolsma et al., 2007), or because they identify with the group of people that is most affected by the threat (e.g. Citrin et al., 1997; Dancygier
and Donnelly, 2013; Scheepers et al., 2002)—not because they are personally
more threatened.

Previous research
The proposition that people most exposed to competition with immigrants
show stronger ethnic exclusion and anti-immigration attitudes has been tested
extensively (Citrin et al., 1997; Dancygier and Donnelly, 2013; Hainmueller
et al., 2015; Helbling and Kriesi, 2014; Scheepers et al., 2002). The most
used indicator of exposure to competition is education. Lower-educated report more ethnic threat and harbor stronger anti-immigration attitudes than
their higher-educated counterparts (see e.g. Billiet et al., 2014; Cavaille and
Marshall, 2019; Dancygier and Donnelly, 2013; Polavieja, 2016; Scheepers
et al., 2002). This has been interpreted as support for ethnic competition
theory, as low-skilled people face most competition from immigrants who—at
least in the United States and in most European countries—tend to be lowskilled. However, ethnic competition is not the only possible explanation
for educational differences in anti-immigrant attitudes. Firstly, education
does not only indicate skills for the labor market, it also reflects general attitudes towards issues such as diversity and ethnocentrism (Hainmueller and
Hopkins, 2014; Pecoraro and Ruedin, 2016). Secondly, education is a coarse
and indirect measure of skill (Ortega and Polavieja, 2012; Pardos-Prado and

6

Xena, 2019; Polavieja, 2016), thus giving limited insights into economic competition.
Survey experiments allow randomizing hypothetical competition to elicit
anti-immigration attitudes in a causal fashion. They can thus tease out the
influence of the factor of interest from associated factors. Hainmueller and
Hiscox (2010) asked half of their respondents about their views on low-skilled
migrants coming to the US and the other half about high-skilled migrants.
They find no evidence of economic self-interest shaping attitudes: both lower
and higher educated respondents are equally opposed to low-skilled immigration and less opposed to high-skilled than low-skilled immigration. Hainmueller and Hopkins (2015) also use a survey experiment to show that labor market position and education vary little with immigration preferences.
Related survey experiments in Switzerland (Helbling and Kriesi, 2014) and
fifteen European countries (Naumann et al., 2018) yielded similar results.
Malhotra et al. (2013) argue that education is a poor measure of competition and conducted an experiment where they varied scenarios about a
specific skill-set (high technology). They find respondents are more opposed
to immigration of people with a similar skill set, thus supporting the role of
economic self-interest, though with a small effect size.
An approach related to Malhotra et al. (2013) using cross-sectional data
exploits variation in competition across segments of the labor market such
as sectors and occupation groups. An inflow of immigrants into an industry
creates ethnic competition, unless the sector is expanding. Dancygier and
Donnelly (2013) analyze the effect of job growth and immigrant inflow at the
sectoral level. Sectoral growth has a negative relation with anti-immigration
attitudes. Sectoral immigrant inflow is unrelated to anti-immigration sentiments during times of economic growth, but it increases anti-immigration
attitudes when economies are declining or perceived to be declining. This
pattern holds for higher- and lower- educated workers in the same way, even
though they supposedly differ in the extent to which they would personally
face competition from immigrant inflows. This goes against expectations
based on self-interest. Dancygier and Donnelly (2013) interpret their findings
as support for group-interest based expectations, with people’s perception of
group competition shaped by their sectoral experience.
7

Using both cross-sectional and panel-data, Pardos-Prado and Xena (2019)
find a negative effect of the occupational unemployment rate on attitudes
towards immigrants. As the occupational unemployment rate has but a very
weak relation with national economic satisfaction, they interpret their finding
as support for the self-interest rather than the group interest explanation;
people in occupations with higher unemployment are more anti-immigration
because they are concerned about their personal employment chances, not
about the economy as a whole.
Another group of studies focusing on personal interest explanations of
economic competition and anti-immigration attitudes examines the role of
job skills. Over and above education, Ortega and Polavieja (2012) took into
account the time it would take to learn a specific job, given the required
education-specific human capital — and the degree of manual vs. communicational intensity of a position. Workers in occupations that require more
specific human capital and more communication—in jobs that presumably
can less easily be taken up by immigrants—are less opposed to immigration,
also after accounting for level of education. Instead of replaceability of the
worker, Pardos-Prado and Xena (2019) focus on workers’ chances of finding a
new job (labor demand). Defining skill specialization as occupational group
segmentation, they show that people with higher levels of skill-specificity
are more negative about immigration. They argue this is because people
in highly specialized occupations will find it more difficult to find new employment and are thus more concerned with newcomers in the labor market.
Even though the two studies find contradictory effects of skill specialization,
both purport to support the personal interest path of ethnic competition theory. An alternative explanation of their findings could be the role of ‘work
logic.’ Occupations that require more interactions with other people may
for example lead their holders to have more liberal attitudes, including towards immigration (Güveli et al., 2007; Oesch, 2012; Van de Werfhorst and
de Graaf, 2004).
Unemployment is a more direct measure of personal competition. Unemployed people are personally confronted with competition in their attempts
to re-enter the labor market. Findings on the relation between unemployment and ethnic exclusionism are contradictory; some studies supporting
8

that unemployed people perceive more ethnic threat and are more antiimmigrant than those in employment (Billiet et al., 2014; Scheepers et al.,
2002; Schneider, 2008; Van Setten et al., 2017), and others finding no such
relation (Citrin et al., 1997; Kuntz et al., 2017; O’Rourke and Sinnott, 2006).
Heizmann (2015) found that unemployment has a stronger negative relation
with perceived labor market competition when policies make it more difficult
to re-enter the labor market, specifically when there is stronger employment
protection legislation. Using German panel data and a fixed-effects approach,
Lancee and Pardos-Prado (2013) show that becoming unemployed leads to
more concern about immigration. These findings are in line with ethnic
competition theory, particularly with a self-interest interpretation.
In sum, the call is still out on labor market competition theory. There
is no consensus as to how competition should best be conceived. Comparisons of educational groups only give a very broad impression of differences
in labor market competition, both comparison of education groups and skills
can be confounded by unobserved factors, survey experiments hinge on the
assumption that reactions to hypothetical scenarios are similar to real-world
reactions, and it remains uncertain whether the relations found are based on
personal or group interest. In their review, Hainmueller and Hopkins (2014,
p. 241) claim that the labor market competition hypothesis is ‘something of
a zombie theory’ because it repeatedly failed to find empirical support. However, as the above overview shows, several recent studies claim support for
the role of labor market competition in shaping anti-immigration attitudes.
Fixed-term contracts offer an opportunity to put the labor market competition hypothesis to a further test because they introduce variation within
educational, sectoral, and occupational groups, thus complementing and extending earlier studies. An examination of fixed-term contracts is particularly well-suited to contribute to the debate on self- vs. group interest basis
of attitudes. If a relation between fixed-term contracts and anti-immigration
attitudes is established, this is unlikely motivated by group interest. The
group interest path assumes that people in certain positions have more information about immigrant threat and that they identify more with the group
most under threat by incoming migrants. Conversely, the information position of fixed-term contract workers does not differ substantially from that of
9

their peers on permanent contracts. Furthermore, because they are scattered
across sectors and occupations, it is unlikely that workers on fixed-term contracts have developed a strong subgroup identity that would lead them to see
immigrants as a threat to their particular social group. Fixed-term contract
workers are however personally more vulnerable to competition than their
peers in the same sector and/or occupation.

Fixed-term contracts as a labor market insecurity
According to OECD data for 2019, 13.6 per cent of employees in the EU-28
are on a temporary contract. Among 24–54 year-old employees, 11.6 per cent
have a temporary contract, up from 9.4 per cent in 2000 (OECD, 2020b).
This average hides considerable variation; ranging from a share below three
per cent in the Baltic States and Romania to over 25 per cent in Spain. Fixedterm contracts have long-term negative impacts on wages (Pavlopoulos, 2013;
Yoon and Chung, 2016) and are associated with delayed childbirth and worse
mental health (Auer and Danzer, 2016; Scheuring, 2020). Contract type is
also related to attitudes; people on fixed-term contracts are more in favor of
income redistribution and political parties that support these policies (Marx
and Picot, 2013; Marx, 2014; Vlandas, 2020).
In the labor market, fixed-term contracts make workers more vulnerable
to competition. To replace workers on permanent contracts, employers need
to fire them. This is generally a costly procedure. Fixed-term workers however can be let go at the end of their contract term at low or no costs to the
employer. Workers on fixed-term contracts indeed perceive their jobs as less
secure than those on permanent contracts (Erlinghagen, 2008).
As people on fixed-term contracts will need to compete on the labor
market in the foreseeable future, it is in their personal interest to limit competition. Following the predictions of ethnic competition theory, we therefore
expect that workers on fixed-term contracts are more opposed to immigration
than those on permanent contracts (Hypothesis 1A).
Several authors have argued that anti-immigration attitudes are not triggered by the level of competition, but by a change in competitive conditions
(Dancygier and Donnelly, 2013; Lancee and Pardos-Prado, 2013; Meuleman

10

et al., 2009). This leads to the hypothesis that workers on fixed-term contracts become less opposed to immigration when they receive a permanent
contract (Hypothesis 1B).
Exposure to competitive threat is not the same for all fixed-term contract workers. Firstly, the intensity of competition with immigrants for jobs
depends on whether employers could hire immigrants to fill these positions.
Following Dancygier and Donnelly (2013), we take share of immigrants in a
sector as a proxy for replaceability. We expect that the difference in antiimmigration attitudes between fixed-term and permanent contract workers is
greater the larger the share of immigrants in the sector of employment (Hypothesis 2).
The intensity of competition also depends on the availability of jobs. We
expect that the difference in anti-immigration attitudes between fixed-term
and permanent contract workers is greater the higher the sectoral unemployment (Hypothesis 3).
Finally, the extent to which having a fixed-term contract increases exposure to competition depends on the relative security of a permanent contract.
Policies that provide a high level of employment protection to workers on permanent contracts and only little to those on fixed-term contracts are known
to lead to strong insider–outsider segmentation. In these labor markets, the
high turnover costs of replacing permanent employees result in low transition rates between contract types, thus making workers on fixed-term contracts particularly vulnerable (Passaretta and Wolbers, 2019; Polavieja, 2003,
2005). We expect that the difference in anti-immigration attitudes between
fixed-term and permanent contract workers is greater the larger the gap in
employment protection of permanent vs. temporary contracts (Hypothesis 4).

Cross-national analysis: European Social Survey, 2002–18
Data and method
Our analyses draw on nine rounds of the European Social Survey (ESS, 2002,
2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2016, 2018), collected in the years from
2002–2020. The ESS is a biennial, repeated cross-sectional survey that comprises information from respondents aged 15 years and older in 36 European
countries. Not all countries participated in all rounds. The quality of the
ESS data collection process is generally considered to be very high (Koch
et al., 2009), as in all countries random probability samples are drawn and
face-to-face interviews are conducted, following standardized procedures and
strict quality controls to ensure representativeness and comparability of the
data. Country samples comprise on average ca. 1,900 respondents per country and survey round. Although many countries were not able to reach the
target response rate of 70 per cent, the average response rate is 60.4 per cent.
Further descriptions of the ESS, including more detailed information on data
collection and response rates for all countries are available on the ESS web
site (europeansocialsurvey.org).
We restrict the sample to respondents aged 25–55 years whose main activity is employment, living in Western Europe,1 as we are interested in
prime-age workers who have finished full-time education and are not yet approaching retirement. Sample sizes by country and survey round are reported
in Table A1.
Anti-immigration attitudes are our outcome variable and are measured
based on three questions. The general question wording is ‘Now, using this
card, to what extent do you think [country] should allow people from [a
certain group] to come and live here?’ [Country] refers to the country where
the interview takes place. Respondents are asked about three groups, namely
1
Specifically, in Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden,
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom.

12

people from the ‘same ethnic group,’ ‘a different ethnic group,’ and from
‘poorer countries outside Europe.’ Response categories (and values) include:
‘allow none’ (4), ‘allow a few’ (3), ‘allow some’ (2), and ‘allow many’ (1).
The answers to these questions are strongly intercorrelated (r = .70–.83),
have a one-dimensional solution in a principal component analysis (explained
variance = .85%), and have a Cronbach’s alpha of .91 (range across countries
from .84 in Greece and Denmark to .96 in Spain). In line with previous
studies (e.g. Hainmueller and Hiscox, 2007; Hiers et al., 2017), we averaged
the answers across the three questions to obtain a variable ranging from 1 to
4, with higher values indicating a stronger anti-immigrant attitude.
Contract type Contract type was measured with a question ‘Do/did you
have a work contract of unlimited duration (0), or, limited duration (1),
or, do/did you have no contract?’ We have removed the minority of cases
without a work contract and self-employed respondents from our analyses,
which is in line with what other studies (Balz, 2017) have done.
Individual-level control variables We distinguish between male and female (male as reference category) respondents and adjust for differences by
being foreign-born (native as reference), education (broken down into low
education (less than secondary, reference category), medium education (secondary), and high (tertiary) education), age and age squared, working hours,
household income (in country- and round-specific quintiles), and 148 different
occupational groups (based on the 3-digit ISCO-88 coding scheme).
We further stratify our models by social class based on a three-class version of the European Socio-economic Classification (ESEC, Rose and Harrison, 2010). We distinguish between those in the working class (e.g. cleaners
or drivers), in intermediate classes (e.g. office clerks), and in the salariat (e.g.
lawyers or scientists). We do not include social class as a control variable as
most of its variation is captured by the 147 occupation dummies included in
the equations.
Higher-level variables We take account of the share of immigrants in an
industry, calculated as the the number of immigrants (defined as all foreign13

born) divided by the total number of employees, for each 1-digit NACE sector
(Eurostat, 2008) by country and year. It is expressed as a percentage on a
scale from 0-100. Data come from the EU Labor Force Survey and were
provided by Eurostat. For rounds 1–3, data are coded following NACE 1.1,
for ESS rounds 4–8 following NACE 2.0.2 This data is available for all
countries in the ESS microdata.
Sectoral unemployment data also come from the Eurostat and are based
on the EU Labor Force Survey. As with share of immigrants, data is matched
based on 1-digit NACE sector by country and year. Sectoral unemployment
is not available for Norway after 2004.
The gap in employment protection of permanent vs. fixed-term contracts
is measured using the Employment Protection Legislation (EPL) indicators
assembled by the OECD (OECD, 2020a). EPL scores for permanent contracts are based on policies for dismissal (such as notification procedures and
severance pay). The score for temporary contracts are based on the criteria
for hiring (e.g. types of work, maximum contract duration). As Passaretta
and Wolbers (2019) argue, both indicators capture turnover costs. The scores
are normalized to a 0–6 range, in which higher scores reflect higher levels of
protection. Following Passaretta and Wolbers (2019), we use the absolute
difference in EPL scores for temporary and permanent contracts. We calculated the gap in scores for each country and year combination. Scores above
0 reflect stronger protection of permanent vs. temporary workers. This data
is available for all countries. Data for Luxembourg and Iceland are only
available from 2008 onwards.
Analytical strategy In a first step, we make use of ordinary least squares
(OLS) regression to analyze the difference in anti-immigration attitudes between those with fixed-term and permanent contracts. We subsequently control for potential confounders of the contract status–immigration attitude
relation, namely country and survey round dummies plus their interactions
to remove any country- and time-varying confounding, as well as the control
2

For round 4 (2008–9), ESS employed the NACE 1.1 coding scheme, however Eurostat
switched to NACE 2.0 in 2008. We therefore recoded the round 4 industry data from
NACE 1.1 to NACE 2.0.

14

variables listed above. For these regression models, we use cluster-robust
standard errors that take into account clustering at the country–year level.
In a second step, we explore the difference in attitudes between fixed-term
and permanent workers for subgroups. We stratify our analyses by education,
social class, and country. In a third step, we test Hypotheses 2–4, assessing
how the attitude difference between permanent and fixed-term workers varies
by the share of foreign-born in the industry, sectoral unemployment, and the
gap in employment protection by including interaction terms for each of these
factors.

Results
We first examined at the share of fixed-term contract workers in the sample.
The average across the sample is twelve per cent (Table 1), which is in line
with OECD data. Figure A1 shows the percentage of fixed-term workers by
country. Table 1 further reveals that workers with permanent contracts have
a slightly stronger anti-immigration attitude compared to fixed-term workers, fixed-term workers are both better and worse educated than permanent
workers, are more likely to be female, are younger, more likely to be unmarried, work fewer hours, have a lower household income, and be working class
rather than intermediate class.
Hypothesis 1A posits that workers on fixed-term contracts are more opposed to immigration than those on permanent contracts. Table 2 provides
no support for this Hypothesis. The first model of Table 2 shows an effect
pointing in the opposite direction from the one posited in Hypothesis 1A.
Workers on fixed-term contracts have a weaker anti-immigration attitude
than those with permanent contracts (b = −.06, p < .001). This difference
however is substantively small. The standard deviation of the outcome variable anti-immigrant attitude is .75, thus the difference between the groups
amounts to (−.06/.75) −.08 standard deviations.
The second model of Table 2 adds the control variables to the equation.
From Table 1 we already know that fixed-term and permanent workers differ
considerably in important respects. Adjusting for these differences in sex,
origin, education, age, working hours, income, and marital status, as well as

controlling for occupation reduces the difference in attitudes between fixedterm and permanent workers to −.04 (p < .001, −.05 SD). Comparing this
difference to the attitude differences between educational groups, it shows
that the difference between the lower and the medium-educated is twice
as big as the difference between fixed-term and permanent workers. The
attitude difference between the higher educated and the lower educated is
almost seven times as big as the attitude difference between fixed-term and
permanent workers. This underlines that the attitude difference between
fixed-term and permanent works is substantively small.
Table 2 further conducts subgroup analyses by education and social class
– two factors often seen as key determinants of exposure to competitive
threat –, controlling for all variables included in the previous model. Models
by education reveal that the difference is driven by the higher educated,
for those with medium education and low education the difference is not
different from zero at conventional levels of statistical significance. Models
by social class show no relation between contract type and attitudes for the
working class, and a substantively small negative relation in the intermediate
and salariat classes (p < .05 and p < .001, −.07 SD). These findings all
contradict Hypothesis 1A.
While the analyses in Tables 2 remove all between-country variation, we
also conducted analyses to investigate country differences in the size of the
attitude difference between fixed-term and permanent workers. Panel A of
Figure 1 shows the result of this exploration—while there is some variation
in the size of the difference, it is not statistically different from 0 in any of
the 18 countries.
Hypothesis 2 posited that the difference between fixed-term and permanent contract workers in anti-immigration attitudes is greater the larger the
share of immigrants in the sector of employment is. While the average effect
of fixed-term contracts on anti-immigration attitudes is thus close to zero,
this may hide variation related the sectoral share of immigrant workers. To
test the hypothesis, we added the sectoral share of immigrants and the interaction with fixed-term contracts to the model. The results are displayed
in Panel B of Figure 1, revealing that fixed-term workers have lower antiimmigration attitudes when there are more foreign-born in their industry.

and Iceland only observed from 2008 onwards.

Table A2 shows that this difference however is not statistically significant at
conventional levels.
Hypothesis 3 conjectured the relation between contract type and antiimmigrant attitudes is moderated by sectoral unemployment. Panel C of
Figure 1 shows this is not the case; there is almost no discernable effect
of sectoral unemployment on the anti-immigration attitudes of fixed-term
workers. For workers on permanent contracts, there is a very modest increase
in anti-immigration attitudes with higher levels of sectoral unemployment.
Table A2 shows that this moderating effect of sectoral unemployment on the
relation between contract type and attitudes is not statistically significant at
conventional levels.
Hypothesis 4 predicted the difference between fixed-term and permanent
contract workers in anti-immigration attitudes is greater the larger the gap
in employment protection of permanent vs. temporary contracts. Panel D of
Figure 1 shows the opposite is the case; the larger the gap in employment
protection, the smaller the difference in anti-immigration attitudes between
workers on permanent and fixed-term contracts (b = .02, p < .01). Closer
inspection reveals that this effect is driven by the EPL score for temporary contracts. While the predicted anti-immigration attitude for fixed-term
workers is fairly stable across all levels of employment protection, for permanent workers less protection of fixed-term contracts is associated with lower
anti-immigrant attitudes.
In sum, our cross-sectional analyses show no support for the role of labor
market competition in shaping anti-immigration attitudes.

Longitudinal analysis: German Socio-Economic
Panel, 1999–2015
Data and method
While the cross-sectional analyses did not reveal substantial evidence for
the hypothesized positive relation between fixed-term contracts and antiimmigration attitudes, it is too early to dismiss the role of labor market
competition. Firstly, it might be that people on fixed-term contracts differ
from those on permanent contracts in ways that also make them less—or at
least not more—anti-immigration and that are not captured by the control
variables in the models (i.e. are ‘unobserved’). For example, it could be that
people who are less risk averse are both more likely to have a fixed-term
contract and less likely to oppose immigration. Secondly, some have argued
that anti-immigration attitudes are caused by changes in competition rather
than levels of competition, therefore we should examine the effect of a change
in contract status.
To address these two issues, we conducted an analysis of the German
Socio-Economic Panel (GSOEP, Goebel et al., 2019; Schupp et al., 2017) for
the years 1999–2015. GSOEP is a high-quality household panel study that
follows the same respondents over time with annual interviews. Germany is
a key case due to its typicality; it experienced several waves of immigration
over the past decades and its levels of employment protection and prevalence
of fixed-term contracts are close to the median of the countries in the crosssectional analysis. The fact that the data follow individuals over time allows
us to account for both observed and unobserved individual characteristics
in fixed-effects analyses where individuals essentially serve as their own controls. Further, it allows a test of the dynamic interpretation of ethnic group
competition.
We restrict the sample to individuals between 25 and 55 years of age in
paid work to ensure comparability with the ESS analyses.
Concern about migration Our outcome is the answer to the question,
‘How concerned are you about immigration to Germany?’ with three re21

sponse options: ‘Very concerned,’ ‘Somewhat concerned,’ and ‘Not concerned
at all.’ We coded the answer ‘Very concerned’ as 1 and the other two response options as 0. This question, which has been part of the questionnaire
in every year since 1999, has been previously validated as a measure for
anti-immigrant concern (Lancee and Pardos-Prado, 2013; Pardos-Prado and
Xena, 2019), as well-known predictors of anti-immigrant attitudes correlate
with the concern question in the same way. Figure 2 shows the trend in the
outcome variable over time.

Contract type Our key predictor is the contract status of respondents,
based on a question ‘Do you have a fixed-term or permanent employment
contract?’ We disregard self-employed respondents as well as those who are
not working or without a job contract. Descriptive findings for contract types
22

are reported in Table 3.

Control variables We include a number of control variables in our analyses. We control for gender and being foreign-born. Note that these timeconstant variables can only be included in the random-effects models. Further, we control for a number of time-varying control variables: age and
age2 , the number of working hours, household income in wave-specific quintiles, education (lower secondary and below: low, upper secondary: medium,
tertiary: high), marital status, 110 dummies for occupation based on 3-digit
ISCO-88, and survey year dummy variables.
Analytical strategy We conducted linear probability panel regressions
with random and fixed-effects specifications. Particularly important here
is the fixed-effects specification, where each individual essentially serves as
their own control, allowing us to account for all time-constant confounding
factors (e.g. ability, personality), regardless of whether these are observed or
not. This is a major advantage over the ESS analyses, which hinged on the
assumption that all relevant differences between fixed-term and permanent
workers had been observed.
23

Results
Results for the analysis of GSOEP data are reported in Table 4. Having
a fixed-term contract is associated with greater concern about immigration
only in the random effects specification. The effect size here is substantively small, having a fixed-term contract goes along with a one-percent
greater probability of being concerned about immigration. The fixed-effects
specification shows that this association is due to unobserved time-constant
confounders—i.e. stable differences between workers on fixed-term and permanent contracts not captured in the model—, as the relationship becomes
smaller and statistically insignificant once all time-constant factors are accounted for. This further supports our rejection of Hypothesis 1A.
The models on the right of Table 4 test Hypothesis 1B, which holds
that workers changing from a fixed-term to a permanent contract become
less concerned about immigration. While the coefficients for this transition
do point in this direction, they are far from reaching conventional levels of
statistical significance and substantively small. We thus also do not find
support of Hypothesis 1B.
Predictions in Panels A and B of Figure 3 provide a second test of Hypothesis 2, which holds that differences between fixed-term and permanent
workers are greater when the share of foreigners in an industry is greater.
Panel A of Figure 3 suggests that the opposite is the case, yet not at conventional levels of statistical significance. Panel B further emphasizes that
there are no significant differences when looking at the different transitions
of contract types. Hence, we also do not find support for Hypothesis 2 for
the German case.
Finally, Panels C and D offer a second test on Hypothesis 3 which asserted that differences in attitudes become larger with higher unemployment.
Panel C shows that this is not the case, the difference is stable and even
minimally—but not significantly—decreasing with higher unemployment levels. Panel D shows there are no significant differences in the relation between
transition types and attitudes over sectoral unemployment. We thus do not
find support for Hypothesis 3 in the German case.

Discussion
The recent success of anti-immigration parties and politicians across the
Global North has been linked to economic insecurity. A key economic trend
that has worsened labor market conditions of many Europeans is the proliferation of fixed-term contracts. Workers with fixed-term contracts are more
likely to be competing for jobs with migrants than workers with permanent
work contracts. Ethnic competition theory posits that fixed-term workers
should consequently more strongly oppose immigration. This study addresses
critiques on earlier studies that focused on factors which are not only associated with competition but also with general attitude formation—for example
education or job skills—, as contract type cuts across these factors.
The results of our analyses showed little support for ethnic competition
theory. Differences found between fixed-term and permanent workers in their
opinions about migration were substantively small and often not in the expected direction. Even when controlling for education, age, occupation, and
other confounders, fixed-term workers held similar or even more favorable
opinions towards immigration than workers with permanent contracts. This
finding held across 18 Western European countries in a cross-sectional analysis and in a longitudinal analysis of panel data from Germany, a typical
case for ethnic competition theory. Our finding also holds across factors that
influence exposure to competition. We found no evidence that the relation
between contract type and anti-immigrant attitudes is moderated by sectoral share of foreign-born workers or unemployment level. While we did
find evidence of a (modest) moderating effect of the gap in employment protection of permanent vs. fixed-term contract workers, the direction of effect
was opposed to that hypothesized.
Raess and Burgoon (2015) found that companies with higher shares of
foreign-born workers, are more likely to introduce fixed-term contracts. Therefore it could be that people on fixed-term contracts are more likely to have
immigrant co-workers. Following Allport’s (1954) contact hypothesis, this
contact with immigrants leads to less anti-immigration attitudes. The negative effect of contact with immigrant co-workers may counteract any positive effect of increased competition for fixed-term contract workers on anti-

27

immigration attitudes. In our analyses we included the sectoral share of
immigrants as a proxy for the likelihood an immigrant could take over a
job. However immigrant share is likely to also be related to contact with
immigrants in the workplace. Our analyses show no (cross-sectional) or a
positive effect (longitudinal) effect of sectoral share of immigrants on antiimmigration attitudes. This makes it unlikely that there is an underlying
competition effect that is countered by contact experiences.
Strikingly, while our analyses of the German panel data showed no relation between increased job security and concern about immigration, a study
using an earlier version of the same data found a relation between job loss
and concern about immigration (Lancee and Pardos-Prado, 2013). This discrepancy might be because people respond stronger to loss (of employment)
than to gain (of a more secure contract) (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979;
Breen, 1997). That we do not find an effect of the transition from permanent to fixed-term contract either, may be due to the voluntary nature of a
substantial part of these transitions. The role of loss vs. gain may explain
why Dancygier and Donnelly (2013) only found an effect of sectoral shrinkage and of immigrant inflow during an economic crisis: it is not increasing
actual competition that leads to a sense of ethnic competition, but (increasing) competition at a time when people have a realistic fear or experience
of job loss. This finding further underlines the importance of economic loss
as a cross-cutting narrative in contemporary western societies (Jackson and
Grusky, 2018; Paskov et al., 2019).
The effect of loss vs. gain could be explored by studying zero-hour contracts. Such contracts do not specify a minimum number of working hours
for an employee. Employees work on a demand basis and are only paid
for the hours worked. This kind of contract is common in the Netherlands,
United Kingdom, and Austria (European Parliament, 2016). If a sense of
ethnic competition is triggered by loss, workers on zero-hour contracts who
experienced a recent drop in average working hours should be more prone to
express anti-immigration attitudes than those who experienced a stable or
increasing number of hours.
Our findings add to the evidence from earlier research suggesting that
factors other than individual economic prospects are the drivers of attitudes
28

towards migration. While insecure contracts are known to impact people’s
attitudes and life courses, they do not seem effect anti-immigration attitudes.
