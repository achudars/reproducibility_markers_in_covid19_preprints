Not so Responsive after all: European Parties do not Respond to
Public Opinion Shifts across Multiple Issue Dimensions

Abstract
Many studies have found that European parties change their policy positions in response to
changes in public opinion. This is both theoretically and normatively appealing, suggesting that
European party politics operates in a way that is consistent with spatial models. Nonetheless,
virtually all previous studies are based on a single, uni-dimensional measure of public opinion:
left-right self-placement from the Eurobarometer surveys. This measure has a number of flaws,
including the fact that political conflict in Europe now occurs across multiple issue dimensions
beyond the classic divide on state involvement in the economy. We use new measures of Europeans’ ideological positions across four different issue dimensions and twenty-six countries from
1981-2016, together with data on parties’ policy positions from their manifestos, to re-evaluate
findings on responsiveness. Across many different model specifications, samples and outcome
measures, we find virtually no evidence that European political parties respond to public opinion on any issue dimension. Our findings suggest that scholars may require better measures of
party positions, more nuanced theories of responsiveness (for example to sub-groups, or across
longer time horizons), or may need to re-focus their attention towards responsiveness via policy
outcomes rather than parties’ policy commitments.

1. Introduction
The responsiveness of parties to public opinion is generally seen as a pre-requisite for the functioning
of modern liberal democracies. There are two ways that responsiveness can occur: indirectly,
through electoral turnover, or directly, by parties adjusting their policies in line with changes
in public opinion (Stimson, Mackuen, and Erikson 1995). A growing literature on the strategic
behavior of political parties argues that parties do indeed follow this direct mechanism (Adams
2012). Many studies have demonstrated that political parties react to shifts in public opinion
(Adams et al. 2004), that they respond differently to different segments of the electorate (Adams
and Ezrow 2009; Homola 2019), and that mainstream parties’ responses differ from those of niche
parties (Adams et al. 2006; Bischof and Wagner 2017). This literature on the dynamic adjustment
of political parties has made an important contribution in linking formal spatial models to empirical
evidence on the behavior of real-world political parties.
In this article, we re-evaluate parties’ policy responsiveness, applying a novel measure of public
opinion. Empirical analyses of this question so far have largely relied on measuring public opinion
using left-right self-placement extracted from surveys to derive a cross-national measure of public
opinion. However, as noted in this literature itself, this approach comes with a number of problems.
The first is a lack of data, because self-placement is measured from the Eurobarometer survey.
Figure 1 in the Appendix shows how mean left-right placement has evolved in twenty-five European
countries that appear in this paper since 1980. As non-EU countries are not covered by the
Eurobarometer, many countries have data for less than half of the period, and two countries that
feature in this paper – Norway and Switzerland – do not feature at all in the Eurobarometer data.
This lack of coverage is one of the reasons why classic papers on policy responsiveness in Europe
such as Adams et al. (2004) and Adams et al. (2006) in fact cover only eight of these twenty-seven
countries.
Second, it is uni-dimensional. Political conflict in Europe no longer occurs along one left-right
dimension. In addition to traditional conflict over state involvement in the economy, there are
now one or possibly two more dimensions that include questions of the basic organizing principles
of society such as gender equality or immigration (Inglehart 1990; Kriesi et al. 2006; Caughey,
O’Grady, and Warshaw 2019). In this sense, left-right self-identification can at best capture one

2

dimension of dynamic representation. Since many people are “cross-pressured” – e.g. economically
conservative but socially liberal – and then often label themselves as centrist, despite holding very
non-centrist opinions (Treier and Hillygus 2009), left-right self-placement may fail to capture any
dimension accurately.
Third, many respondents do not know what policies are associated with “left” and “right”,
meaning that the measure is strongly influenced by partisanship and identification with partisan
groups (Klingemann 1979; Knutsen 1997; Medina 2013).1 Self-described centrists also often choose
centrist responses because they simply do not understand what the survey question is asking them
(Knutsen 1998; Rodon 2015). Because of this and the issue of “cross-pressure”, over-time variation
in mean left-right self-placements is implausibly low (see Figure 1 in the Appendix). Many countries’
ideologies, on this measure, have remained virtually unchanged since the 1980s, despite widespread
liberalisation of opinions on social issues such as gender equality and LGBT rights.
Fourth, it is susceptible to differential item functioning. Across countries, citizens interpret
the question as being about different issues (Thorisdottir et al. 2007; Bauer et al. 2017). Over
time, the increasing multi-dimensionality of politics means that people interpret “left” and “right”
differently now than they did in the past (Knutsen 1995; De Vries, Hakhverdian, and Lancee 2013).
This makes over-time or cross-country comparisons difficult.
Despite these problems, scholars have understandably relied on left-right self-placement as the
only available measure of citizens’ ideologies across time and space derived from surveys. Adams et
al. (2019) note that with the exception of European integration, it has to date been impossible to test
responsiveness across multiple dimensions. Happily, that is no longer the case. Instead of left-right
self-placement, we use Caughey, O’Grady, and Warshaw (2019)’s measures of ideology. Based on
a Bayesian dynamic group-level IRT model including more than 2.7 million survey responses, they
measured ideological positions for four policy dimensions (“absolute” economic ideology, “relative”
economic ideology – the desire for more or less government spending – social issues, and immigration
issues) for twenty-seven European countries from 1981-2016. The issue questions that make up the
scales are easier to understand than left-right self-placement, and differential item functioning is
less of an issue because the questions have a more universal meaning across time and countries.
Their paper contains extensive validations of the measures, including formal tests of construct and

convergent validity, as well as demonstrating their face validity.2
We adopt a definition of responsiveness that is in line with classic empirical studies: that
responsiveness can be said to have occurred when parties shift their positions in the same direction
as voters’ ideological shifts.3 We measure parties’ dimension-specific policy positions with data
from the Comparative Manifesto (CMP/MARPOR) project (Volkens et al. 2018). Using these
outcome measures together with the new scales for public opinion, we re-examine whether parties
generally move their positions in line with public opinion, whether they respond more strongly to
harmful opinion shifts (Adams et al. 2004) and whether mainstream parties are more responsive
to shifts in public opinion than niche parties (Adams et al. 2006; Bischof and Wagner 2017). In a
series of analyses with varying specifications, we do not find any consistent evidence that parties
respond to short-term shifts in public opinion, measured using manifestos. This includes subsets
for different regions (Western vs. Eastern Europe), different time periods and different parties as
well as different outcome scales. These findings have important implications for the literature on
party competition as they challenge what has become one of its crucial assumptions: that parties
are responsive to public opinion.

2. Data and Methodology
Our analysis includes all countries that have both ideological data and data on party positions
from the Comparative Manifesto Project: twenty-six in all, nearly trebling the number of countries
compared to past studies.4 We are also able to considerably expand the period covered, up to 2017.
Most previous studies (with the exception of Bischof and Wagner 2017) stop in the late 1990s or
early 2000s. The contents of the four ideological scales that we use are shown in the third column of
Table 1. As we demonstrate in the Appendix, our findings are robust to several other specifications
of these scales. We measured parties’ ideological positions from the Comparative Manifesto Project

2. For instance, they show that in the aftermath of the recent refugee crisis outlying countries receiving a lot of
refugees such as Greece, Hungary and Italy, turned against immigration more than other countries, and that all
countries became substantially more left-wing in terms of relative economic issues after the financial crisis.
3. It is important to note that such a specification does not preclude the possibility that voters are responding to
parties.
4. We included all available countries included in Figure 1 in the Appendix except Luxembourg, which does not
feature in the Caughey, O’Grady, and Warshaw (2019) data. We added in Norway and Switzerland. Germany is
included from 1990 onwards. We excluded Northern Ireland.

used from the Comparative Manifesto Project (CMP)

(CMP) separately for each dimension, using the logit scaling method of Lowe et al. (2011). We
created scales that matched the issue content of the ideological scales as closely as possible. The
coding categories used from the CMP are shown in the fourth and fifth columns of Table 1. We
included all parties that received 1% or more of the vote on average for the elections that they
contested in our dataset. We also followed previous studies in excluding parties that represent only
a specific region (e.g. those from Catalunya), agrarian parties, and parties that campaign only on
single issues, all of whom should not be expected to respond to overall national public opinion.
As is standard with CMP data, each of our four scales measures parties’ positions using the
balance of right-wing and left-wing ‘quasi-sentences’ in a manifesto. The more positive the score,
the more right-wing expressions there are relative to left-wing. The scores range from roughly -5 to
5, with standard deviations between 1.63 and 2.04 and means close to or slightly below zero, except
for relative economic issues where most parties express more pro-spending than anti-spending views.
In the Appendix, we show that these scales produce sensible distributions by party type.
To measure responsiveness, we followed the approach of two previous classic studies – Adams
et al. (2004) and Adams et al. (2006) – examining how party positions respond to changes in
citizens’ ideological positions, but do so separately for each of the four ideological dimensions. The
period covered by each ideological scale is shown in the second column of Table 1; they are available
biannually. We matched each party’s domain-specific ideological position from the CMP with the
nearest complete observation of its citizens’ ideologies. Thus for an election held in either 2016 or
2017, each party is matched with the ideological score of its country’s citizens for 2015-16.5 Each
ideological scale has a mean of close to zero and standard deviations that range from 0.77 to 0.91.
In line with past studies, we use OLS regressions where the unit of analysis is each party at each
election, clustering standard errors by election. For each of the four issue areas that we consider,
the dependent variable is the change in dimension-specific left-right party position (e.g. social
issues) since the previous election. The main independent variable of interest is the change in the
dimension-specific left-right ideological position of the country’s citizens since the previous election.
We also follow Adams et al. (2004) and Adams et al. (2006) in including country fixed effects with
no overall intercept, as well as controlling for a lag of the dependent variable, a lag of the change
5. In the Appendix, we show that our results are robust to changing the way that the ideological scales and party
positions are matched

6

in the party’s vote share (i.e., between the previous two elections), and an interaction between the
lagged dependent variable and the lagged change in vote share.
We carried out three different tests for responsiveness. The first simply asks whether parties
respond to public opinion shifts in general. The second repeats the main test from Adams et
al. (2004), asking whether responsiveness is conditioned by the type of public opinion shift: benign
or harmful. Testing this involves re-specifying public opinion shifts as ‘harmful’ when opinion
moved in a direction that should make it harder for that party to be elected, assuming spatial
voting (e.g., a left-wing party facing a right-ward shift in public opinion), and ‘benign’ in the
opposite situation (e.g. a right-wing party facing a right-ward shift in opinion). The third repeats
the main test from Adams et al. (2006), asking whether responsiveness is conditioned by party
type: niche or mainstream. Testing this involves adding a dummy variable for niche parties and an
interaction between this dummy and shifts in citizens’ ideologies. All of these additional variables
were coded identically to the original papers. For instance, niche parties are parties from the green,
communist/socialist and nationalist families.

3. Results
The results of our three tests are shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4. We use the original variable names
from Adams et al. (2004) and Adams et al. (2006) for ease of comparison. The main variable of
interest in Table 2 is Public Opinion Shift: the change in each country’s domain-specific ideological
position since the last election. Table 3 distinguishes between harmful and benign shifts in citizens’
ideology. There, Harmful Public Opinion Shift equals the change in citizens’ ideology when the
change is harmful (as defined above) and 0 otherwise, and Benign Public Opinion Shift equals
the change in citizens’ ideology when the change is benign and 0 otherwise. Table 4 distinguishes
between niche and mainstream parties: Niche equals 1 for niche parties and zero otherwise. In
all three tables, Previous Policy Shift refers to the lagged change in party position, and Previous
Change in Vote Share measures the lagged change in the party’s vote share. Higher values for
the dependent variable always indicate the party adopting a more right-wing stance in the given
domain and higher values for Public Opinion Shift indicate greater conservatism amongst citizens
for the given domain. Positive coefficients for the public opinion shift variables would therefore
7

imply responsiveness.
We find virtually no evidence that parties respond to opinion shifts in any of the issue domains,
regardless of the type of party or the type of opinion shift. For all four issue areas, there is no
evidence of statistically significant responses to ideological change (Table 2, first row), and no
evidence of responsiveness to either harmful or benign ideological changes (Table 3, first two rows).
The issue is not simply a lack of power to detect an effect. Instead, the estimated coefficients are
substantially small and close to zero. Take as an example the largest coefficient on public opinion
in Table 2, for immigration/nationalism. The standard deviation of the party position variable
for immigration is 2.04 and that of the immigration ideology scale is 0.88. Thus a one-standarddeviation shift of the public to the right on immigration is estimated to be associated with only a
0.1-standard-deviation increase in parties’ immigration conservatism.

There is also very little evidence that responsiveness is moderated by type of party (Table 4,
first three rows), except that niche parties are estimated to respond virtually one-to-one to changes
in voters’ immigration ideologies. This finding is consistent with, for example, far-right parties
becoming more opposed to immigration when their citizens become more opposed, and vice-versa
for niche parties of the left. Even here however, with so many hypotheses being tested at once
without adjustments for multiple testing, one should expect to see an occasional false positive
result even in a world where all all effects are truly zero (Benjamini and Hochberg 1995). Overall,
our findings suggest that policy responsiveness to public opinion shifts is at best confined only to
a small subset of parties on the single issue of immigration.

The Appendix extensively explores the robustness of these results. Our first robustness checks
involved changing the sample used. Our results are unchanged both if we restrict attention only to
Western European countries6 and if we use only elections from before 1999, the same period covered
by Adams et al. (2004) and Adams et al. (2006). Our second set of robustness checks explored several different codings of the dependent variables, full details of which are in the Appendix. First, it
might be considered questionable whether environmental issues belong in the “social/postmaterial”
category. Lowe et al. (2011), for example, argue that environmental issues are more about economics and should be considered separately. We therefore re-coded the party positions on social
issues without the inclusion of environmental issues. Second, we explored recoding (i) absolute
economic issues using the “free market economy” scale proposed by Lowe et al. (2011); (ii) relative economic issues using the “state involvement in the economy” scale proposed by Benoit and
Laver (2007); (iii) social/postmaterial issues using the “social liberal-conservative” scale proposed
by Benoit and Laver (2007); and (iv) using the “liberal-authoritarian” scale proposed by Wagner
and Meyer (2017). The results are again unchanged in all cases.
Finally, we explored changing the matching between citizens’ ideological positions and party
positions. Instead of only using citizens’ ideological positions determined wholly before an election
year, we considered ideological positions determined during and potentially after an election year.
This means that, for instance, a party whose election occurred in 2015 is matched with the citizens’
ideological position from 2015-16 instead of 2013-14. Again, this had no impact on the results.

6. The only exception being immigration, where we find some evidence of general responsiveness, significant at the
10% level. The same caveat for multiple testing applies.

11

4. Discussion
Across many different model specifications, variable codings and samples we find robust evidence
that European parties do not respond to shifts in their citizens’ ideological positions – at least
as responsiveness has been defined by classic studies, using manifesto data as the outcome measure.7 The new ideological scales provided by Caughey, O’Grady, and Warshaw (2019) enabled
us to surmount many of the problems that exist with left-right self-placement data, allowing us to
estimate responsiveness across a much wider set of countries and years as well as across multiple
issue dimensions, respecting the multi-dimensional nature of contemporary European politics.
Our results suggest that prominent theories of representation in Europe may need to be reconsidered. From a normative perspective this may be worrying. The responsiveness of parties to
voters is generally considered to be a cornerstone of democracy. It begs the question of what can
explain the lack of responsiveness. We can suggest several possibilities to guide future research.
The first is that the theory is correct, but we are unable to confirm it with the available data
on party positions. Criticisms of the Comparative Manifesto Project abound in the literature
(e.g. Mikhaylov, Laver, and Benoit 2012), and rchanges in party positions measured by the CMP
correlate poorly with other alternative measures purporting to capture the same concept (Adams
et al. 2019). As Adams et al. (2019) argue, political scientists may need to re-think their reliance on
the CMP and instead explore other measures of parties’ policy commitments. Alternatives include
party press releases (Sagarzazu and Klüver 2017), leaders’ speeches (Hobolt and Klemmensen 2008)
or voting advice applications (Gemenis 2013).
Another possibility is that responsiveness does occur, but differently than via the framework
used in this paper and in classic past studies. Responsiveness may occur more in response to
changes in voters’ issue priorities than to their issue opinions (Klüver and Spoon 2016). Or perhaps
parties respond not to the electorate in general, but to sub-constituencies such as citizens who
are more engaged with politics (see Adams and Ezrow 2009), swing voters, groups with higher
turnout, or their own party supporters. Testing many of these theories would require estimating
7. An alternative interpretation of our results is that the direction of the relationship is the other way around.
That is, that we find no evidence of voters responding to parties. This possibility has generally been assumed away
in many past studies, although Adams, Ezrow, and Somer-Topcu (2011) tested it and found no evidence that voters
respond to party manifestos. Future work should pay more explicit attention to the direction of the relationship
between elites and voters.

12

multi-dimensional ideological positions for sub-groups, which is feasible using the methodology of
Caughey, O’Grady, and Warshaw (2019).
Moreover, we look only at short-term shifts in public opinion and party positions. Normatively,
Mair (2009) argued that ‘responsible’ parties need not be responsive to short-term shifts in opinion,
making decisions in the interest of the longer-term greater good. None of our results rule out the
possibility that parties respond to broad shifts in opinion over longer time horizons than electionto-election. For example, the British Conservative Party made virtually no responses to the largescale liberalisation of public opinion on social and postmaterial issues since the early 1980s until the
election of David Cameron as their leader in 2005. He quickly changed the party’s positions toward
greater support for environmental causes and LGBT rights. This large and sudden change in its
position produced long-term congruence between the party’s policy position and public opinion.
Finally, policy positions are far from the only way in which parties can respond to public
opinion. Changes in policies themselves are arguably a much more normatively important form of
responsiveness, and again this type of responsiveness is not inconsistent with our results. Indeed,
Caughey, O’Grady, and Warshaw (2019) find that countries do in fact respond to left-wing shifts
on relative economic issues by raising the generosity of welfare provision. To us, a greater emphasis
on policy responsiveness would represent an important way forward in this literature.
