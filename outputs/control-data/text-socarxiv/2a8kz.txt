"14" "The Location of Local 287(g) Program Applications and Inquiries (2005-2012)"
"15" "Introduction"
"16" "This document includes a list of local law enforcement agencies (LEAs) that submitted applications and inquiries to the federal government regarding the 287(g)  immigration enforcement  program.  The information described in this document was originally obtained and shared via Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests to  the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS)  – first  by Justin Cox and  later by  William Rosales.  In preparing this document, I have reviewed and requested copies of the documents from DHS  and have compared  information  obtained in documents  obtained  by Cox and Rosales . Corrections to the information  below  will be included in update versions of this document, which will be noted on the title page."
"17" "Total 287(g) Applications and Inquiries  (2005-2012)"
"18" "Between 2005 and 2012, county and city LEAs across the country submitted inquiries and applications to participate in  the   287(g) program. The program trains local officers and deputies to assist the federal government in investigating and enforcing immigration law violations.  Local  LEAs first participated in the program in 2002,  and  participation grew dramatically between 2006 and 2009.  At its height d uring the  first term of the  Obama Administration, the program extended to  over  7 0   local  LEAs ."
"19" "DHS  also  received about twice (145) as many applications and inquiries from  local LEAs .  Among these,  the vast majority  of LEAs  (14 2 ) did not implement a 287(g) program before the inauguration of President Donald Trump.  Three exceptions are :"
"20" "Alamance County, NC withdrew an application in 2008 after implementing a 287(g) program in 2006 ."
"21" "Bristol County, MA  and Plymouth County, MA both  had an  application  whose  status was  “ pending ”  in 2011 , and then  implemented  a 287(g) program  on  January  18,  2017 ."
"22" "Among the 14 2  LEAs that expressed interest but did not implement a program  during the Obama Administration ,  10  are located in counties where  other  LEAs did implement a 287(g) program:"
"23" "Boaz, Alabama"
"24" "Apache Junction, AZ"
"25" "City of Prescott, AZ"
"26" "City of Costa Mesa, CA"
"27" "City of Orange, CA"
"28" "Middlesex County, MA"
"29" "City of Mesquite, NV"
"30" "Wylie, TX"
"31" "Houston, TX"
"32" "Fairfax County, VA"
"33" "In sum, b etween 2005 and 2012 , 13 2   distinct  LEAs submitted applications and inquiries to DHS regarding the 287(g) program  but are located in places where a local 287(g) program was not implemented ."

"64" "TABLE: Location   and Status  of 287(g) Program Applications and Inquiries from Local Law Enforcement Agencies"
"65" "LEA:  I nquiries and applications from local  law enforcement agencies  to DHS between 2005 and 2012 are identified below , including two regional entities in Virginia.  I list the entity identified in the FOIA documents – most commonly either a sheriff department/office or police department but also “detention center”, “detention facility”, or “regional jail.” In one case, the location (and not an LEA) is provided as it appears in FOIA documents (e.g., Village of Bensenville).  I note the state and region for each application and inquiry."
"66" "YEAR:  I note the  year  based on the earliest known date  of an  LEA first submitt ing an   application  or  inquir y   to  DHS ."
"67" "STATUS:  The status of the application or inquiry includes three categories as noted in FOIA documents: withdrew; denied; or unclear. A status of “unclear” means the FOIA documents did not provide a status or noted the status was “pending.” I have included an additional note (“not implemented”) for those locations where no 287(g) program was ever implemented.  As noted earlier, Bristol and Plymouth Counties had pending applications dating back to 2011 and both implemented 287(g) programs in January of 2017."
"68" "DUPLICATES:  Some LEAs appear to have submitted multiple applications and inquiries: Overton County Sheriff’s Department, TN (2008); Rutherford County Sheriff's Office, TN (2006 and 2011); Fort Smith Police Department, AR (2007 and 2008); Oklahoma County, OK (20 07  and 201 1 ); and  Rappahannock Regional Jail, VA (2008 and 2012).  I list the earliest known application or inquiry."
"69" "NOTE:  The list below excludes state and local 287(g) programs approved by DHS and enacted with the cooperation of LEAs."
"70" "I also  exclude  12 applications and inquiries from  state-wide entities governments, department of corrections, associations, or highway patrol :  Arkansas State Police (2007) ;  State of Colorado ( 2007 ) ;  Kentucky Department of Corrections (2007) ;  State of Massachusetts ( 2006 ) ;  Mississippi Department of Corrections (2008) ;  Mississippi Department of Public Safety (2008) ;  Rhode Island Department of Corrections (2008) ;  South Carolina Department of Public Safety (2011) ; Texas  Department of Criminal Justice/OIG (2006) ;  State of Utah ( 2009 ) ;  Virginia Department of State Police (2012) ;  Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (2010).
