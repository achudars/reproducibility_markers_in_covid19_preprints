MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

How strong are soccer teams? The ‘Host paradox’
and other counterintuitive properties of the FIFA’s ranking.*

Marek M. Kaminski

Abstract: FIFA's ranking of national soccer teams is plagued with paradoxes. One surprising
paradox is a dramatic underrating of the hosts of main tournaments. The hosts, who are absent
from the preliminaries, for a long time, play only friendlies that award few points. Three models
estimate the magnitude of the resulting “Host Effect” at 14.1-16.7 positions. Such an estimate
goes against the intuition that a large investment in hosting a tournament should result in
improvement of the host team’s standing. Host’s low ranking decreases the interest in the
tournament and may result in a major loss of advertisement revenue.

1. Introduction
The 2018 soccer World Cup took place in Russia. There were calls for a boycott
following Russian annexation of Crimea and the “hybrid war” in Donbass. Ultimately, some
presidents of competing teams skipped the Cup. But perhaps the biggest worry for President
Putin was the poor standing of the Russian team. On June 7, just before the first match, FIFA
rated Sbornaya at position 70, just between Côte d'Ivoire and FYR Macedonia, as the lowest
ranked team of all 32 competitors. Opinionated comments pronounced that the Russian team,
“arguably the poorest in the history of Russian football” (ESPN 2018a), was lucky to get a
relatively easy first-round group but “this is even better news for Uruguay, Saudi Arabia and
Egypt, because they get to face Russia — the worst Pot 1 team by a wide margin” (ESPN+
2018).
Then, a miracle happened. Russia humiliated Saudi Arabia 5:0 and convincingly
defeated Egypt 3:1 in the first group round-robin phase of the Cup. They became the first team
that advanced to the last 16 knockout phase. Among the eight Pot 1 teams, Poland and Germany

Page 3

failed to qualify; Argentina did it only thanks to a last-minute goal. Russia’s ‘safety margin’ was
comfortable: it would advance even if any two of its goals were subtracted. Then, again, in two
dramatic matches Russia first beat the world superpower Spain in penalty shoot-out and then
narrowly lost penalty shoot-out to Croatia (the finalist and potential World Champion) while
being very close to advancing to semi-finals.
Was it really a “miracle”? Systems other the FIFA’s ranking rated Sbornaya much
higher: from 42 (CTR 2018) to 45 (ELO 2018) and 49 (rankfootball 2018). Similar “miracles”
happened in previous tournaments and involved outperforming tournament hosts. The problem
that created this illusion of a “miracle” was that the FIFA ranking seriously undervalued the
tournament’s hosts. Hosts qualify by default then, until the tournament’s beginning, they only
play friendlies. At the same time, other teams play highly valued qualification matches. Since a
team gets fewer points in a friendly rather than in an official preliminary (for the same result
with the same opponent), the host is doomed to fall down in the ranking. Before the 2018
tournament, the preliminaries started as early as March 12, 2015 (in Asia) and as late as
September 4, 2016 (in Europe), and lasted until November 15, 2017. Since the weights for
recent matches are much higher than for older ones, at some point about ¾ of the host’s score
may be awarded for friendlies only. Over the time preceding the World Cup, Russia had been
predictably sliding in the world rankings (see Figure 1).

This paper investigates in more detail this perverse “Host Effect” leading to a “Host
Paradox,” and extends the initial analysis in Kaminski (2012) xx [remove for submission]. I
begin with reconstructing the details of the FIFA ranking. Section 3 warms up the reader by
briefly describing a few paradoxical traits of the ranking. Section 4 describes the Host Effect

and examines its magnitude with the data from past tournaments. Section 5 discusses possible
solutions. The last section concludes with the assessment of the paradox’s consequences.

2. FIFA and its ranking
FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association) is the international governing
body of 211 national soccer and similar sports associations. Founded in 1904 and headquartered
since its birth in Zürich, FIFA is managed by 25-member strong Executive Committee headed by
the President. FIFA’s main activity is the organization of the FIFA World Cup, its preliminaries,
and other tournaments. It also coordinates the activities of six regional federations that supervise
local championships and friendlies (friendly matches) of their members. Territorially, the
federations approximately cover different continents and include Asian Football Confederation
(AFC, with Australia included), Confederation of African Football (CAF), Confederation of
North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), South American
Football Confederation (CONMEBOL), Oceania Football Confederation (OFC) and Union of
European Football Associations (UEFA).
Among the FIFA’s highest profile activities is the monthly ranking of national soccer
teams. The positions of teams are duly noted by the media and may affect sponsor generosity.
More importantly, the ranking determines the teams’ chances in drawing opponents in the
preliminaries and main tournaments of various Cups, including the World Cup. Teams are
bundled into “pots” that include the top-ranked teams (pot 1), the same number of teams ranked

Page 6

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

immediately lower (pot 2), and so on. Each group includes exactly one team from each pot.
Thus, having a higher ranking implies the lower expected ranking of opponents, which is a proxy
for their strength.
FIFA’s ranking has evolved over time. The recent 2006 version takes into account the
results of the official matches the national team played in the past four years, the opponent’s
position in the ranking, the strength of opponent’s federation and the match’s importance.1 For
every game the team receives points. About once a month, the average score is calculated for the
past 12 months, previous 12 months, etc. The position in ranking reflects the weighted average
score for the past 48 months. The details of the procedure are as follows:

1) Score for every match: The team receives the number of points equal to the product:
P=M×I×T×C
where the factors are calculated according to the following rules:
•

M (the match’s result): 3 for victory, 1 for tie and 0 for defeat; in a penalty shoot-out, the
winner receives 2 points and the loser 1 point. Earlier, if preliminaries included a twomatch game, and the results were symmetric, the result of the second match was
disregarded and the points were assigned as if penalty shots were applied. Supposedly, a
change took place in 2012 but the exact new rules are unclear;

•

I (importance) depends on the match’s category and is equal to:

1 Procedures, scores and ranking positions are quoted from the FIFA’s website (2018a). The procedure for ranking
women teams is different. See Congdon and Matheson (2013) for the comparison of the FIFA men and women
rankings.

Page 7

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

1 – A friendly or a minor tournament;
2.5 – Preliminaries to World Cup or a Federation’s Cup;
3 – Federation’s Cup and Confederations Cup;
4 – World Cup.
•

T (opponent’s strength) depends on the opponent’s most recent position r in the FIFA
ranking and is equal to (200 – r). Exceptions: for the ranking’s leader T = 200 and for
teams ranked from position 150 downwards T = 50;

•

C (correction for federation’s strength) is equal to the average strength of the team and its
opponents’ federations. The strength of a federation is calculated from its members’
results in the three most recent World Cups. As of June 2018, C was equal to: 1 for
CONMEBOL; 0.99 for UEFA; 0.85 for CONCACAF, AFC, CAF and OFC.

2) Average score for the year (beginning at a certain date and ending exactly 12 months later) is
equal to an arithmetic mean from all matches if the team played at least five times. With a
smaller number m of matches, the average is multiplied by 0.2 × m.

3) Position in ranking r at a given moment represents the total weighted sum of points over the
past four years according to the formula:
R = P-1 + 0.5 P-2 + 0.3 P-3 + 0.2 P-4

Page 8

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

where every component P-i is the average score for matches played over the period 12(i – 1) and
12i months back: P-1 – last 12 months; P-2 – between 12 and 24 months back; P-3 – between 24
and 36 months back; P-4 – between 36 and 48 months back.

3. Examples of paradoxes
FIFA’s page declares that “The basic logic of these calculations [the ranking] is simple:
any team that does well in world football wins points which enable it to climb the world ranking”
(FIFA 2018). Unfortunately, the FIFA ranking sometimes violates this and other simple
properties, i.e., it is vulnerable to “paradoxes.” The term “paradox” was made popular in voting
theory and social choice theory by books by Brams (1975) and Ordeshook (1986). It denotes a
situation when a ranking behaves contrary to our basic intuition, i.e., it doesn’t satisfy certain
properties that are interpreted as “obvious,” “desired” or “fair.” Vulnerability to paradoxes is
closely related to vulnerability to manipulation.2 Social choice theory taught us that every
ranking based on preferences must violate at least one of certain desired properties (Arrow
1951). Whether one can find an equivalent of Arrow’s Theorem for ranking soccer teams, i.e.,
with the information that is available, remains an open question. Below, I provide examples of a
few striking paradoxes.

2 Lasek et al. (2016) list several methods of „optimization” of a team’s position in the FIFA ranking, including
choosing the number of matches, choosing correct opponents, avoiding friendlies and creating score-improving
coalitions. Wang and Vandebroek (2013) offer a similar analysis of strategic opportunities.

Page 9

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

Certain features of the FIFA formula are bound to generate criticism from a soccer fan.
For instance, the number of points doesn’t depend on whether a team plays at home. Thus, in a
match of a similar importance, a team receives more points for defeating Qatar at home (the
controversial organizer of 2022 World Cup and ranked 98 on June 7, 2018) than for a tie with
Brazil (#2) played on the famously intimidating Estádio do Maracanã in Rio. It is known that
friendlies provide few points, so a team that did well in the preliminaries may choose to
strategically avoid playing friendlies. For instance, Romania was criticized before the 2018
World Cup preliminaries for strategically playing only one friendly (and being seeded);
similarly, Poland was criticized before the 2018 World Cup for not playing friendlies until the
ranking was used to seed them in the top pot. Thanks to such quirks, a team may climb the
ranking despite common wisdom placing it much lower. Notably, in September 1993 and July
and August 1995, Norway was ranked second while in April 2006 USA was fourth. Sometimes
paradoxical results happen systematically.

Violation of Weak Goal Monotonicity: losing a goal increases the score
An intuitive property should be that a team’s score would increase or at least stay
constant with every additional goal won by that team. Until 2012, FIFA’s rules sometimes
violated this property of “Weak Goal Monotonicity.” A violation happened when preliminaries
included a two-legged home-and-away game. When the results were symmetric, the result of
second match was disregarded and the points were assigned as if penalty shots were applied.

Page 10

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

Example: Team A plays with Team B in a two-match competition for advancing to the
next round. A first defeats B at home 3:0, and then loses 0:3.3
If the match ends with 0:2, A would advance to the next round receiving zero points for
the lost match. When A loses the third goal, the score becomes symmetric (3:0 and 0:3), and the
result of the second match is decided by penalty shots. But A’s score for this match increases
with the loss of a third goal! If A loses the penalty shoot-out, it receives some points with a
multiplier 1; if A wins, the multiplier is 2. In both cases the number is positive instead of getting
zero for 0:2. As an effect, losing the third goal by A automatically increases A’s FIFA score for
the match and possibly its position in the ranking!
A mirror problem appears for Team B that receives more points for a match won 2:0 than
for winning 3:0, regardless of the result of penalty shots.
The “Weak Goal Monotonicity” paradox appeared in several matches. In JordanKyrgyzstan preliminaries on October 19, 2007, Jordan lost 0:2 and ten days later beat
Kyrgyzstan at home 2:0. For winning 2:0 and then winning penalty shots Jordan received
284.75 points while for winning only 1:0 it would receive substantially more, i.e., 427.125
points.4 A similar problem was noted when on July 12, 2011, Saint Lucia defeated Aruba 4:2
after losing earlier also 4:2. In November 2005 Australia beat Uruguay in penalty shoot-out after
first losing 0:1 and then winning 1:0. Losing the goal guaranteed Uruguay the same score in the
case of losing penalty shots or a better score in the case of winning.
3 Apparently, FIFA fixed the problem although no correction to the rules could be found (Edgar 2012). See a
comprehensive discussion of the problem on football-rankings (2012).

In general, similar problems appear always when the result of a two-match competition is
settled with penalty shots. It is not easy to eliminate the paradox. Penalty shots constitute an
additional “mini-match” played after two symmetrically ended games. If penalty shots affect the
score, then we get into difficulties similar to those described above. If penalty shots do not affect
the score, then the fact that one team overall beat the second one is disregarded.
There are more problems. In all examples below, we assume that (a) all teams played
exactly five matches in every twelve-month period used for calculations; (b) that the matches
would not be re-classified to a different period after the ranking is modified; (c) that no other
matches were played between the old and new rankings; (d) that the Federation strength C = 1.

Automatic Loss of Leadership: The ranking’s leaders automatically lose their
positions after a match
A is the ranking’s leader, B is second, C is third. A and B play a friendly. Regardless of the
score, after the match C becomes the new ranking leader.

Note: P-i is a mean score for year i back. In all periods, exactly five matches were played.

The table shows the scores before A and B play the match. After the match, the score changes.
The maximum number of points that A can receive for defeating B is P = M×I×T×C =
3×1×198×1 = 594. As an effect, the average score for the last 12 months for A is 682 (after
rounding), and the total score for the ranking is 1182. Similarly, the best-case scenario for B is
defeating A. In such a case, B’s score is equal to 1173. Both numbers are smaller than the total
score of C, which remains unchanged. Thus C becomes the new ranking leader.
In the above example the problem appears due to a low weight for the friendly. Even
glorious defeat of a high-ranked opponent may lower the total score and the position in the
ranking.

Weak Ranking Reversal: Tie reversing the ranking
A is ranked higher than B. In a friendly, A ties with B. B is now ranked higher.

For a tie in a match with B, A receives M×I×T×C = 1×1×170×1 = 170 points while B receives
1×1×180×1 = 180 points. After including the result of the tie in the mean for the last twelve
months, the total score of Team A in the ranking is 1178 (after rounding) while B’s score is
1180. As an effect, B is now ranked higher than A.
The problem is due to A being ranked higher thanks to a relatively better previous year.
As an effect, the tie lowers A’s score by more points than the B’s score. What is interesting is
that the paradox may appear even if the higher ranked A beats B (as shown below)! However, in
order to obtain this stronger version of the paradox, greater differences between the teams’
scores in different years are needed. This makes the occurrence of such a paradox less likely.

Strong Ranking Reversal: Victory reversing the ranking
Team A ranks higher than Team B. In a friendly, A beats B and, as an effect, B is now ranked
higher than A.

A receives for a victory 3×1×170×1 = 510 points while B gets 0. Consequently, A has after the
match 1202 points while B has 1217. B is now higher ranked than A.
The core problem for all the examples above is the low score assigned to friendlies and
the fact that the means for four years are computed independently. If a team’s high ranking
depends mostly on a fantastic previous year, then even a victory in a low-value friendly may ruin
its position. On the other hand, for a team with a weak previous year, even a defeat may be
negligible. The Reader, equipped with all this knowledge, should be able to construct the
following paradoxes:
Round-robin reversal:
1. Teams A, B and C are in one group of a round-robin tournament in World Cup;
2. Ranking before the tournament: ABC;
3. Results of the tournament: A comes first, B is second, C is last;
4. Ranking after the tournament: CBA.
Double reversal:
1. Teams A and B play two consecutive matches;
2. There is tie in the first match and the relative ranking of both teams is reversed;
3. There is a tie in the second match and the relative ranking is reversed again.

Page 15

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

4. The estimation of the Host Effect
The FIFA ranking treats the hosts of its tournaments especially poorly. The source of problems
is a low weight assigned to friendlies versus preliminaries to World Cup or regional Federation
Cups (the multiplier of 1 versus 2.5). Since hosts advance to main tournaments automatically,
they do not play in the preliminaries that typically start about two years earlier. Thus, for about
two years before the tournament, the host plays only low-scoring friendlies. Recall that the score
is a weighted sum of scores from four years (with the weights equal to 0.2, 0.3, 0.5 and 1, from
the most distant to the most recent year). There is a moment when the friendlies have the total
weight of about 0.75 of all results from the past four years. Even when a host scores in such
friendlies very well, its position in the ranking may go down!5
Example: Poland, the co-host of Euro 2012, played only friendlies in 2011. Out of 13
matches, Poland won 7, tied 3 and lost 3. They beat strong opponents such as Argentina (#10 at
the end of 2011) or Bosnia and Herzegovina (#20), losing in close games to Italy (#9) and France
(#15), and tying matches with Greece (#14), Germany (#2) and Mexico (#21). Overall, 2011
was a good year, much better than the previous two years (in 2010, victories-ties-defeats were 26-3; 2009: 3-2-2). Despite a good year, Poland ended 2011 ranked 66th with 492 points, only
slightly better than at the end of the terrible 2010 (#73) and lower than in 2009 (58). The FIFA

5 FIFA vaguely acknowledged that the host has “less opportunity for getting more points” (FIFA 2018b). Various
publications describe the problem with respect to specific hosts; e.g., Wang and Vandebroek show how their ranking
system and its variants avoid the Host Effect problem for the organizers of Euro 2012, Poland and Ukraine.

Page 16

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

ranking punished Ukraine, the other co-host of Euro 2012, as well. At the end of 2009, Ukraine
was ranked 22nd, in 2010 it fell to 34th, and it ended 2011 at 55th.
If Poland had played all of its 2011 matches in the Euro 2012 preliminaries with identical
results then, at the end of 2011, it would have received approximately 1381 points instead of just
492. With such a score, it would have been ranked second instead of 66, behind Spain (1564)
and ahead of the Netherlands (1365)! The difference in weights for friendlies and preliminaries
is responsible for this disparity. I will later re-calculate Poland’s hypothetical score using a more
subtle method that returns a more intuitively justified ranking.
The estimation of the Host Effect presents substantial methodological challenges. Below,
I discuss three alternative methods. The data included 26 hosts of eight World Cups, nine Asian
Cups and nine Euro Cups. There were four cases of partially missing data. After the change in
the ranking methodology in 2006, FIFA re-calculated its ranking back to 1993, which made
possible including tournaments taking place from 1994 onwards.6

6 Certain regional tournaments were omitted: CAF and CONCACAF Cups take place bi-annually, and the
preliminaries take place in the same year as the main tournaments. This creates a short life span for a potential Host
Effect. CONMEBOL has a small number of members and no preliminaries while OFC is an amateurish federation
with 11 official members and the best team ranked at 119 (New Zealand).
The estimation involved a couple of methodological dilemmas. First, the data do not come from a
“representative sample” but are generated by three processes, i.e., non-random selection of the host, non-random
selection of matches and the random process with an unknown distribution, i.e., the results of matches. The author
believes that the first process could affect the analysis in a noticeable way mostly for the World Cup while the
second process doesn’t introduce any systematic bias. However, Macmillan and Smith (2007) argue that such
sample selection bias introduces to the general studies of the FIFA ranking serious statistical problems. Second, I
used in calculations ranking positions rather than FIFA scores that creates a problem due to ordinal measurement.
However, the paradox in the Host Effect I am interested in is due to a host’s subjectively low position in the ranking.
Any result obtained with the FIFA scores would have to be translated into mean ranking loss that would re-create
the ordinality problem.

Page 17

Average dip in the ranking
The most obvious question is: what is the average dip (loss of positions) in the ranking due to the
Host Paradox? Let’s assume the following notation for the key variables:
T – year of the tournament;
rT – last ranking before the tournament (in case of unclear timing, the ranking from the
month immediately preceding the month of tournament);
rP – the ranking immediately preceding the start of host’s confederation preliminaries
(missing data for USA 1994);
rT+4 – the first ranking in January or February of year T+4 (missing data for recent hosts
Russia 2018 and France 2016; ranking for Australia 2015 from June 2018);
∆ = rT – ½( rP + rT+4) – the estimated individual Host Effect (in case of rP or rT missing,
the other number was used and the weight given to ∆ in the mean was 1/2).
At the time of rP, there were no negative consequences of future preliminaries while at
the time of rT+4, the preliminaries were too old for the calculation. The mean of both rankings
was used to smooth random variations in the teams’ performance and a potential effect of
growing FIFA membership. Finally, rT is the last ranking before the tournament where
preliminaries still carry heavy weight that is publicized in the media and often used as the
measure of a host’s strength (see the Appendix).

A bar over a variable denotes its mean value. Table 1 shows the calculations of 𝑟P, 𝑟T+4
and 𝑟T for the Euro, Asian Cup, World Cup and all three Cups combined. Hypothesis 1
operationalizes the conjecture of the Host Effect and states that a positive dip Δ in the ranking
can be identified:

Nonparametric binomial tests were run with rT > rP and rT > rT+4 counted as “successes” and rT <
rP and rT < rT+4 counted as “failures” (ties disregarded, q the probability of success). The pvalues for the one-sided test “H0: q = 0.5” vs “HA: q > 0.5”: Euro+World+Asian – 0.000; Euro –
0.000; WC – 0.008; AC – 0.008. The Appendix includes the data for all 26 hosts.

Page 19

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

The overall average dip in ranking, as represented by Δ, is equal to 14.2. For all cases,
the estimated dips are positive and in double digits; the p-values are small despite low counts for
regional tournaments. Hypothesis 1 is corroborated in all cases.
The exact estimates for specific tournament types have to be treated with caution due to
small counts. The smallest effect appears in the World Cup (the change of +11.6). One
mitigating factor may be the fact that all recent World Cup host teams, except for Russia, were
very strong in their regions. One or two years before the World Cup, all eight teams took part in
main regional cups, where it was relatively easy to qualify. Six out of eight host teams also took
part in the previous World Cup. Thus, the Host Effect is partially offset by the non-random
process of selecting the hosts, i.e., the higher probability of offering the World Cup organization
to regionally strong teams, which have more opportunity to play in highly weighted matches than
weak teams, and which lose less often due to not playing in preliminaries. Moreover, one year
before its main Cup, FIFA organizes a small Confederations Cup. The host and the World
Champion play with the champions of regional confederations. This gives the strong host teams
an opportunity to relatively easily score highly weighted points against the champions of smaller
confederations.
There are many more teams that play in regional Confederation Cups than in the World
Cup. Thus, non-participation in the World Cup preliminaries is offset to a greater degree by
participation in Confederation Cups than vice versa. One would expect a stronger effect for the

Page 20

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

hosts of regional preliminaries than for the hosts of the World Cup. The data confirm this
conjecture.
A strong Host Effect appears for the Asian Cup (+17.4). One can speculate that the effect
is relatively less polluted by the participation in other main tournaments since the teams of the
organizers of Asian Cup are substantially weaker than the organizers of the World Cup or Euro
(see the Appendix). While every host of the World Cup took part in the earlier Confederation
Cups, no host of Asian Cup except for China participated in the earlier World Cup. China didn’t
gain anything from their participation since they scored no points and no goals. Thus, the hosts
of Asian Cup earned their ranking points only in Federation preliminaries, Federation main
tournaments, World Cup preliminaries as well as in friendlies. The only non-systematic effect
influencing the results was non-participation in the regional championship.
In the case of Euro organized by UEFA, the high Host Effect of 17.5 could be somewhat
reduced by the fact that five out of nine hosts participated in the earlier World Cup. Similarly to
the World Cup, the hosts of Euro have much stronger teams than the hosts of Asian Cup, and
have more chances of playing highly valued matches. Nevertheless, playing friendlies decreases
the average score quickly for the high-ranked UEFA teams. Given typically high positions of the
European teams in the ranking, the Euro effect seems to be most consequential.

Estimated dip as a function of a team’s position
Another question, implicitly present in the earlier discussion, is whether the dip depends
on a team’s strength. A strong team has more chances of playing in highly valued tournaments

Page 21

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

than a weak team due to a higher probability of advancing to regional Cups and the World Cup.
Stronger teams are separated by many more points than weaker ones. Moreover, a strong host
may additionally benefit from the FIFA’s Confederations Cup, organized a year before the
World Cup. All those effects suggest that the ranking of a strong team is less vulnerable to the
Host Effect.
An assessment of how the Host’s Effect depends on the host’s initial ranking would allow for a
more precise estimation of the losses. An examination of the scatter plot should help to quickly
decide whether the relationship is linear (see Fig. 2).7

Figure 2: Scatter plot of host rankings at P and T

7 For the alternative explanatory variable rT+4 all results are almost identical; the disadvantage is that for T+4 there
are three data points missing versus one for P. Due to strong multicollinearity (Spearman’s rho correlation 0.965),
rT+4 and rP couldn’t be used jointly.

Note: The position in the ranking rT is estimated with the ranking preceding the preliminaries rP
(for all three Cups); an approximate regression line is displayed.

The scatter plot shows a clear linear relationship but also suggests heteroscedasticity problem
that is confirmed by tests. Thus, the estimated standard errors are biased and OLS results should
be treated as representing the parameters of the population of all hosts so far but one should be
cautious with interpreting them as the estimates of the general relationship.8

Heteroscedasticity arises at least partially due to the one-sided constraints of the ranking, i.e., the fact that highranked teams can fall in rankings but their rise is limited (for the #1 team, it cannot go up at all). Heteroskedastic

Note: R2 = 0.84; Adj R2 = 0.83; F(1, 23) = 119.78. See the Appendix for the data for all 26 hosts.
For the United States 1994, the preliminaries started before the FIFA’s oldest ranking.

The change of the Host Effect is surprisingly weakly dependent of the initial team’s
position. The intercept of 12.1 and slope of 1.078 means that the host team with a certain
position in the ranking at time P can expect to slide down in the last pre-tournament ranking by
12.1 plus 0.078 of its pre-preliminaries ranking. Thus, knowing the host’s ranking rP, one can
estimate that the position at time T increased by 12.1 + 0.078 rP. The average estimated dip in
the ranking according to this method is 16.0. The results confirm that stronger teams in fact slide
less than weaker ones but the difference is small.

two-step GLS estimation returns a significant constant of 4.42 and a borderline significant exponential coefficient of
0.023. However, the estimates used this way are mostly unreasonable, e.g., for rP = 25, 𝑟T ≈ 10.7 (negative host
effect); for rP = 50.4 (mean), 𝑟T ≈ 96 (very big mean effect); for rP = 60, 𝑟T ≈ 289 (beyond the range of rT). Since the
OLS intercept has substantial variance, a linear regression suppressing intercept was also run. Suppressing intercept
to zero would be equivalent to assumption that for high-ranked teams the Host Effect is almost non-existent, which
has no justification in theory or data. The estimate of a mean Host Effect in this case was similar.

Comparative analysis of the FIFA and alternative rankings
While the FIFA ranking is the most popular, alternative rankings use different methodologies for
ordering national teams. If the Host Effect is caused by factors specific to the FIFA ranking, we
should not be able to see it in other rankings. Otherwise, if some external intervening factors are
responsible for the Effect, we should be able to identify it in the alternative rankings as well.
Table 3 below repeats the values of FIFA aggregate rankings for tournament hosts in the first
row and shows the respective indicators compiled from the rankings produced by two alternative
systems. The Elo ranking, named after a Hungarian physicist and chess player Árpád Élö, is
most notably used for ranking chess players.9

cases except at T+4 for recent hosts France 2016 and Russia 2018; rankfootball: the rankings were available for the
beginning of years T–2, T and T+4 from the end of 1996 and except at T+4 for recent hosts France 2016 and Russia
2018.

Note: Nonparametric binomial tests run for rT > rP and rT > rT+4 counted as “success” and rT < rP
and rT < rT+4 counted as “failure” (ties disregarded, q the probability of success). The p-values
for the one-sided test “H0: q = 0.5” vs “HA: q > 0.5”: ELO – 0.93; rankfootball – 0.17;

The two alternative rankings seem to be immune to Host-like effects. The average rankings of
all three systems are very close for the times P and T+4, when the Host Effect was not present.
However, ELO and rankfootball provide similar averages for the time T before the beginning of
the tournament but FIFA displays a big dip. Both alternative estimates of the size of the Host
Effect are insignificant. ELO is closer to significance (0.12 for a change in direction “HA: q <
0.5”) and estimates that the host’s position is slightly higher at the start of their tournaments than
the average of rankings at P and T+4.
If we estimate the Host Effect as a difference between the average estimates of the ranking at
time T for FIFA and the two alternative rankings, we will get two numbers: 14.1 (for
rankfootball) and 16.7 (for ELO).

Solutions
The Host Paradox can be essentially eliminated or reduced with two simple solutions.

Freezing the host’s score
The simplest method of dealing with the Host paradox is to freeze the host’s score at about the
time the preliminaries start. The European confederation UEFA applies an equivalent solution.

Page 26

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

UEFA uses its proprietary scoring system in order to assign teams to pots and allocate club
tournament spots to countries. The rules for the UEFA ranking make an explicit provision for
tournament hosts (UEFA 2018, p. 53):
In the case of an association that has hosted a UEFA EURO or FIFA World Cup final
tournament during one of the reference periods as mentioned under Annex D.1.2 and
therefore has no points from the respective qualifying competition, the points earned in
the most recent qualifying competition in which the association has taken part are used.
The preliminaries to the 2018 World Cup started almost 3.5 years before the main tournament
and the most important European preliminaries started about two years before the tournament.
The moment of freeze could be a subject of discussion but for main regional confederations it
could happen at the start of preliminaries and end with their last match. About ½ year before the
tournament, when the preliminaries are over, the calculation could be unfrozen, and the score
computed as if the period of freeze didn’t exist. About 3.5 years after the tournament, the host’s
score would be back to the usual calculations, i.e., with the use of matches from the past four
years. Freezing could be also annulled if a host declared in advance such a desire.

Substituting friendlies with preliminaries
The second solution is more complicated but has an advantage of using actual recent scores. It is
motivated by the question asked earlier for Poland: what would be its position, if some of the
matches played in 2010 and 2011 had been assigned a higher multiplier in order to compensate

Page 27

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

for the higher multiplier of 2.5 used in the preliminaries for an average number of matches
played in the preliminaries?
Using the multiplier of 2.5 to all matches would be too generous to the host team. Let’s
estimate the modified score for Poland for 2010 and 2011, when the preliminaries took place,
under the following assumptions:
(1) The points and positions in the ranking of all other teams remain unchanged;
(2) Each of the 26 matches of Poland played in 2010-11 receives the multiplier (preliminary
versus friendly) equal to (26-9.725)/26 × 1 + (9.725/26) × 2,5 = 1.56 (see explanation below);
(3) Some actual opponents in friendlies, such as Mexico or Argentina, were non-European and
couldn’t be in the same preliminary group; in the case of friendly opponents such as Germany,
France and Italy, only one team could be in the same group with Poland in the preliminaries.
This aspect is disregarded since an implicit assumption is that specific teams are less important
and the results in friendlies are only proxies for actual results;
(4) The possibly lower incentive to play in a friendly is also disregarded. This may make it easier
for weaker teams to score well against teams that are stronger but less motivated and may also
experiment with reserve players;
(5) All friendlies played in 2010-11 are included.10

10 I am grateful to Marcin Malawski for discussing problems described in (3)-(5). He suggested another alternative
method of estimation that would take into consideration only those teams with whom Poland could actually be
competing in the preliminaries.

Page 28

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

In point (2) the weights were calculated using the average number of matches played by the
European teams that played in groups of six or five, and with some additional rounds. Since 51
teams played 248 matches, the average is equal to 9.725. The weight of 1.56 uniformly
distributes the extra weight of 14.59 from 9.725 hypothetical preliminary matches to 26 actual
friendly matches.
Under such assumptions, Poland’s score would look as follows:
2008: 288.74 (unchanged);
2009: 171.4 (unchanged);
2010: 347.52 (estimated) instead of 222.8;
2011: 389.1 (estimated) instead of 249.4.
The total number of points at the end of 2011 would be equal to 288.74×0.2 + 171.4×0.3 +
347.52×0.5 + 389.1 ≈ 672. Such a score would give Poland 39th position in the December 2011
ranking, i.e., 27 positions higher than the actual ranking.11 This would be closer to the FIFA
ranking’s competitors that rated Poland substantially higher: ELO – 38; RoonBa – 23;
Rankfootball – 31; CTR – 33; AQB – 28.

Conclusion
The Host Paradox is deeply unintuitive. Countries hosting soccer cups invest massive amounts
of money to show off. The cost of the 2018 World Cup in Russia was (probably under)
11 The scores of all teams were recorded as of February 17, 2012, when Poland’s position in the FIFA ranking was

estimated from $14.2bn to $20bn (ESPN 2018b) while the economic impact was (probably over)
estimated at $30.8bn over the ten years from 2013 to 2023 (Simpson 2018). Major soccer
tournaments provide an opportunity for a thriving democracy to promote it achievements and for
an autocracy to soften its image. One would expect that the host’s team would benefit from the
resulting bonanza and, on average, would improve its quality and position in rankings.12
However, instead of slightly climbing up, as predicted by ranking ELO, hosts of tournaments
begin their steep slide down to end the ride – according to our estimates – between 14.1 and 16.7
positions lower (see Figure 3).

Figure 3: Average slide down of 25 tournament hosts over the 30 months preceding the
tournament in the FIFA ranking

12 Leeds and Leeds (2009) found that having hosted a World Cup in the past strengthens the FIFAs score of a
country by adding on average 218 points; the estimate wasn’t significant though. Other papers analyzing the
determinants of the FIFA score include Hoffmann et al. (2002), Houston and Wilson (2002) and Macmillan and
Smith (2007).

Over the first half a year little happens; then there is about 1.5 year of steep ride down; finally,
the last half a year is quiet again. The period of steepest moves coincides with a typical timing
of preliminaries; some kinks in the graph can likely be attributed to other tournaments taking
place at about that time.
The Host Effect is especially important for the host teams and their fans; non-hosts may
jump in the ranking over one or two hosts. The deterioration of the host’s position negatively
affects the organizers and turns away sponsors’ money. Perhaps the most salient effect is the

Page 31

MAREK M. KAMINSKI Host paradox

lowering of interest in the tournament among the fans and sponsors! When the author traveled to
Poland during Euro 2012, his casual conversation with a cabbie about the chances of the Polish
team started with a resigned statement: “Mister, they are so low in the [FIFA] ranking that
nothing will help them.” Later that day, the author’s father repeated this gloomy prognosis using
the same FIFA ranking to make his point. Clearly, a low position leads fans and sponsors to
underestimate their team’s chances and lowers their interest in the tournament.
The Host Effect leads to substantial fluctuations in the host team’s position before and
after the tournament. It contradicts the FIFA’s intention that the ranking provides a universal
and objective tool for evaluating teams’ strengths.13 The low ranking of the team translates into
lower chances in the next preliminaries since the lower-ranked teams are bundled in the lower
pots for drawing, and expect facing stronger opponents.14 The erroneous placing of hosts lowers
the ranking’s power for predicting results of single matches.15
Offensive public comments of high-profile commentators that preceded the 2018
tournament in Russia are also nothing new. Before the 2012 Euro Cup, a typical opinion was
that of Peter Schmeichel, a former Danish goalkeeper and the coach of Manchester United, who
belittled the Polish team: „[In Euro 2012] 15 best European teams will play and also Poland – the
13 FIFA (2012c).
14 In the preliminaries for the 2010 World Cup, CONCACAF, CAF and UEFA used FIFA rankings from various
months preceding the drawing for separating teams from different pots; for 2010 World Cup the October 2009
ranking was used; for the preliminaries to the 2012 Olympics CAF used the ranking of March, 2011 (Wikipedia
2012); before the 2018 World Cup one could observe strategic behavior of some teams in order to maximize their
position in the rankings.
15 The FIFA ranking’s predictive power is estimated below almost all alternative rankings, including the Elo
ranking (Lasek et al., 2013); Luckner et al. find that ‘prediction markets’ outperform the FIFA ranking in terms of
forecast accuracy; the FIFA ranking was found to be somewhat accurate in predicting the success of subsets of top
teams in the World Cup finals (Suzuki and Ohmori 2008) but no comparison with other methods was offered.

28th team in the ranking.”16 (Gazeta 2012). While Poland didn’t make a splash in the
tournament, missing advancing higher by one goal, it soon started climbing in the ranking until it
reached its all-time high 5th in the world in 2017.
While pretending to be a “neutral” tool that promotes some objective standards in
evaluating national teams, the FIFA ranking actually disheartens host’s fans and discourages the
sponsors. The flaws in the ranking are not impossible to eliminate or restrict. The obvious
solutions would be to freeze the host’s position for about 1.5-2.5 year or to introduce higher
weights for friendlies played by the hosts. While the details of such arrangements introduce
certain obvious dilemmas, a sensible solution of this sort would greatly limit the negative effects
of the present formula used by FIFA.

the main tournament, respectively;
rP – last ranking before the start of preliminaries (at dateP);
rT – last ranking before the tournament (at dateT);
rT+4 – first ranking (January or February) four years after the tournament year (missing data for
recent hosts);
∆ = rT – ½(rP + rT+4) – estimated Host Effect for individual hosts; if one of the numbers was not
available, the other was used instead of the mean;
For rP and rT, same month or the month preceding the month of the beginning of tournament if it
was unclear which ranking was the last one;
