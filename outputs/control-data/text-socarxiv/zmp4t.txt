BACKGROUND: The Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) county-to-county migration
data are an incredible resource for understanding migration in the United States. Produced
annually since 1990 in conjunction with the US Census Bureau, the IRS migration data
represent 95 to 98 percent of the tax-filing universe and their dependents, making the IRS
migration data one of the largest sources of migration data. However, any analysis using the
IRS migration data must process at least seven legacy formats of these public data across
more than 2000 data files – a serious burden for migration scholars.
OBJECTIVE: To produce a single, flat data file containing complete county-to-county
IRS migration flow data and to make the computer code to process the migration data freely
available.
METHODS: This paper uses R to process more than 2,000 IRS migration files into a
single, flat data file for use in migration research.
CONTRIBUTION: To encourage and facilitate the use of this data, we provide a
single, standardized, flat data file containing county-to-county 1-year migration flows for the
period 1990-2010 (containing 163,883 dyadic county pairs resulting in 3.2 million county-year
observations totalling over 343 million migrants) and provide the full R script to download,
process, and flatten the IRS migration data.

Introduction
Migration flow data (ie, the number of migrants from location i to location j) are typically
difficult to obtain information despite their importance (Willekens et al., 2016; Rogers, Little
and Raymer, 2010). Migration scholars typically focus on cross-border, international migration flow data and recent country-to-country migration data are vital for understanding
migration processes (Abel and Sander, 2014; Abel, 2017, 2013). However, there is growing
demonstrated importance surrounding subnational migration flows (Sorichetta et al., 2016;
Curtis, Fussell and DeWaard, 2015).
In the United States, subnational migration flow data is available from three primary
sources depending on the time period: the Decennial Census, the American Community
Survey, and the Internal Revenue Service’s (IRS) county-to-county migration data (described
in detail in the corresponding section below). The IRS migration data are a pioneering use
of administrative records to estimate demographic processes and are available on an annual
basis since 1990. Because of the annual availability, relatively long time series, large universe
due to the administrative records, and long history of use, the IRS data are an attractive
data source for conducting migration research in the United States (e.g. Curtis, Fussell and
DeWaard (2015),Molloy, Smith and Wozniak (2011),Frey (2009)). Unfortunately, these data
exist in seven legacy formats, split between 2,000+ data files making analysis with this data
rather burdensome and has likely hindered the widespread adoption of this valuable resource
for US migration scholarship.
To encourage and facilitate the use of this tremendous migration resource, we make two
contributions: (1) we publish a single, flat, standardized data file containing all county-tocounty 1-year migration flows for the period 1990-2010 (containing 163,883 dyadic county
pairs resulting in 3.2 million county-year observations totalling over 343 million migrants),
and (2) we publish the open-source R code used to process the IRS data into the single, flat,
standardized data file for reproducibility, transparency, and educational purposes. Schol-

ars who wish to use these data should still familiarize themselves with the strengths and
weaknesses, idiosyncrasies, and design of these data (see (Gross, 2005; Engels and Healy,
1981; Franklin and Plane, 2006; Pierce, 2015) for discussions on the IRS data) and with the
procedures outlined in this document and in the corresponding R code1 .
We have attempted to introduce as little post-processing as possible to process the data
into a common format. US Counties are fairly stable geographic units but some changes
in county boundaries, names, and FIPS codes due occasionally occur2 . To try and keep
as close to the original data fidelity as possible, we did not recode any geographic changes
and present the IRS migration data as-is. For instance, Broomfield County, Colorado (FIPS
08014) was created out of parts of Adams, Boulder, Jefferson, and Weld counties in 2001 and
thus has data only after 2002. Users should be aware of any changes in county boundaries,
county names, or FIPS changes that could substantially alter any analysis of this data3 .
We organize the following document as follows. First, we describe the IRS countyto-county migration data to provide an overview of the data for scholars who might be
unfamiliar with the IRS migration data. Second, we provide usage notes providing important
information that may assist other researchers who want to use our data. Third, we describe
our single, flat, standardized file and document important nuances in the raw IRS migration
data. Finally, we describe parts of the R code used to download the IRS migration data and
process it into a common format.
The IRS migration data are an incredible tool for understanding migration. By providing
these data in a readily available format and the subsequent open-source computer code
used to process these data, we hope to facilitate their use in descriptive, exploratory, and

analytical research of migration in the United States using administrative data. This data is
particularly useful for understanding migration as a spatial entity and for investigating the
evolution of migration systems over time.

IRS Migration Data
The IRS began using tax data to estimate migration in the 1970s and 1980s (Engels and
Healy, 1981; Franklin and Plane, 2006) and began releasing migration data in 1990. The
IRS uses individual federal tax returns, matches these individual returns between two tax
years (for instance tax year 2000 and tax year 2001), and identifies both migrants and nonmigrants. Beginning with tax year 1991 (migration year 1990), the IRS produces these
data in conjunction with the US Census Bureau using the IRS Individual Master File which
contains every Form 1040, 1040A, and 1040EZ (Gross, 2005). Migration is identified when
a current years’ tax form contains an address that is different from the matched preceding
years’ return. A non-migrant is identified when there is no change in address between two
years. For the 2002 tax year, the IRS migration data contained approximately 130 million
returns (Gross, 2005).
The annual series of county-to-county migration data cover 95 to 98 percent of the taxfiling universe (or approximately 87% of US households (Molloy, Smith and Wozniak, 2011))
and their dependents making these data the largest migration data source for count flows between counties in the United States. The IRS derives migration information from tax-filings
making those who do not file taxes most likely to be underrepresented in the migration data
(Gross, 2005; DeWaard, Curtis and Fussell, 2016), namely undocumented populations, the
poor, the elderly, and college students (Gross, 2005). However, the overwhelming majority
of householders file US tax returns in the United States (Molloy, Smith and Wozniak, 2011).
The IRS reports a number of important variables in their data. They identify both the
origin and destination counties; the number of tax returns or filers associated with those
moves (roughly analogous to the number of households and listed as the returns field in
4

the raw data) who moved from county i to county j and the number of tax exemptions
associated with those moves (roughly analogous to the number of individuals and listed
as the exemptions field in the raw data). They also report the number of non-migrants,
reported as the number of tax returns and exemptions associated with migrants from county
i to county i. We treat the exemptions field as the total number of migrants.
Between 1990 and 2010, the IRS processed the county-to-county migration data using
the same procedures. However, in 2011 the IRS introduced a new method for processing
the migration data and introduced “enhancements” to improve the overall quality of the
data (Pierce, 2015). The IRS introduced three major changes. First, they began basing
migration on a full year of data as opposed to a partial year of data. To meet Census Bureau
deadlines, the IRS processed all income tax returns filed before the end of September and did
not process the returns filed between the end of September and the end of the calendar year.
Beginning with migration year 2011, the IRS included the approximately 4% of returns that
are filed between the end of September and December 31, allowing the IRS to produce a full
calendar years’ worth of migration. Second, the IRS improved the year-to-year matching,
increasing the number of matched returns by 5 percent. Prior to 2011, the IRS used only
the primary filer’s taxpayer identification number (TIN), potentially excluding individuals
who may be listed as a dependent in year 1 but file on their own in year 2 or in cases where
a secondary filer in year 1 (such as a spouse) files as a primary filer in year 2. After 2011,
the IRS broadened their matching process to include primary, secondary, and dependent
TINs to improve the matching process by 5 percent. Third, the IRS began tabulating gross
migration at the US State level by size of adjusted gross income (AGI) and the age of the
primary taxpayer.
These changes to the processing of returns create a break in the historic time series. For
this reason, we limit the data we process to the period 1990-2010, the last year before the
new processing rules. If a scholar wishes to process any IRS migration data after 2010, the
R code that we provide can be easily adapted to do so.

Comparisons to other US migration data
As stated in the preceding section, the three main sources of migration data in the US are
the Decennial Census long form, the American Community Survey, and the IRS county-tocounty migration data.
Up to and including Census 2000, the long form of the Decennial Census contained the
question “Where did you live five years ago?” providing 5-year migration data once every
decade. With the discontinuation of the long-form in Census 2010, the Census Bureau
began collecting migration information on the American Community Survey (ACS) with the
question “Where did you live one year ago?” providing 1-year migration data with each ACS
release.
The Decennial long-form was a robust sample, surveying approximately one in every six
(16.7%) of US households. The ACS is a smaller survey with a sample size of approximately
2 million US households per year. Due to the smaller sample size, the Census Bureau pools
responses into 5-year averages for county-to-county migration data. Thus, ACS migration
data represents 1-year migration data over a 5-year period. The Census Bureau processes
the ACS migration data and releases county-to-county migration data sets on an annual
basis reflecting the 5-year average (2010-2014, 2011-2015, etc.).
The ACS migration products and the IRS migration data both have strengths and weaknesses. Table 1 compares the ACS migration products with the IRS migration data in some
key areas. The ACS universe is more complete than the IRS migration universe, lacking
the tax-paying universe bias present in the IRS data, however the ACS migration data contains approximately 2% of the observations in the IRS migration data. The IRS releases
the migration data annually allowing annual comparisons while the Census Bureau suggests
only non-overlapping 5-year products should be compared to each other (ie 2005-2009 and
2010-2014) (Brown, 2009).
To demonstrate potential uses of the IRS migration data, Figure 1 shows detectable
changes in migration flows aggregated to gross-migration flows in four sample counties. These

four sample counties are just some of the easily detectable impacts of major US events such
as Hurricane Katrina in 2005 (Curtis, Fussell and DeWaard, 2015) or the Great Recession.
These migration changes are largely be undetectable in the ACS migration data or our ability
to detect such changes is hampered by the 5-year release.
While the IRS migration data allows for analysis of annual changes, the IRS migration
data contains no sociodemographic information. The ACS and Decennial Census migration data, on the other hand, contain county-to-county migration information crossed by
sociodemographic information for some releases. If a migration scholar were interested in
rapid changes in migration patterns, the IRS migration product would be more appropriate.
If a migration scholar were interested in the sociodemographic details of migration, the ACS
migration products would be more appropriate.
Despite these limitations, scholars have successfully used the IRS migration data to forecast interstate migration (Isserman et al., 1985), investigate migrant destinations after Hurricane Katrina (Curtis, Fussell and DeWaard, 2015) and other broader spatial patterns of
migration (Henrie and Plane, 2008), and to examine possible explanations (Molloy, Smith

7

and Wozniak, 2017) to the Great Recession’s migration slowdown (Frey, 2009). Making
these data more easily available in a more standardized format to a broader set of migration
scholars can further our understanding of migration above and beyond the ACS data.

Usage Notes
The dataset generated here provides detailed county-to-county 1-year migration data based
on administrative records. Users of these data should be aware that although the data
have been prepared in a transparent manner with documentation of their creation and postprocessing, and with open-source computer code, little was done to post-process the data
to correct any possible inconsistencies or errors. These data should be used only with full
awareness of the inherent limitations of the IRS migration data and with the knowledge of
the procedures outlined in this document and in the corresponding R code. Caveat emptor
– users beware.
Users should be aware of several limitations of the IRS data. Namely, that any origindestination pair with fewer than 10 tax filers is censored or suppressed by the IRS for privacy
reasons. We have collected these censored flows into a unique FIPS code (FIPS 99999) by
subtracting all uncensored flows from the total number of migrants. Any origin-destination
pair with fewer than 10 tax filers over the entire period is thus excluded from the final data
file since no data would be recorded in the IRS data file due to censoring.
Users should also be mindful of possible geographic changes to county boundaries that
could affect the data.
The county migration data we present come from the exemptions field of the IRS migration data. The original IRS migration data contains two consistent fields across all years
of data: a returns field and an exemptions field. Returns are the number of tax returns
filed while exemptions are a proxy for the members of the household. We use the number of
exemptions to better mimic the number of individuals migrating rather than the number of
households.

Figure 1: Sample migration streams from the IRS migration data. The annual
release of the IRS migration data allows for detection of rapid changes in migration streams.
The effect of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans LA (a) is clearly visible by the large increase
in out-migration in 2005; the moderate effect of the US housing bubble burst and Great
Recession is detectable in Broward FL (b) and a much greater effect in Clark NV (c) as
evidenced by the decline in in-migration during the 2006-2009 period; even migration streams
nearly unaffected by major US changes are also detectable, as is the case in Kings NY (d)
which appears only marginally affected by the Great Recession or the 9/11 tragedy in 2001.
These migration changes are largely be undetectable in the ACS migration data or our ability
to detect such changes is hampered by the 5-year release. These are just a few examples of
what is possible with the IRS migration data.

Data Processing
The IRS migration data for the period 1990-2010 are available in seven legacy formats.
Table 3 summarizes the similarities and differences in these formats. For every year, the IRS
publishes approximately 104 data files. (52 state entities by in/out-migration. These are
the 50 US states, DC, and a total US migration. Some years contain .csv and .dat summary
files. The underlying file organization, file format, naming schema, and coding can differ
between these legacy formats. Migration years 1990 and 1991 are available as fixed-width
text files, while 1992-2010 are available as excel files. For years 1990-2003, the IRS separated
in/out migration into separate folders while 2004-2010 are published in a single folder. Each

10

legacy format utilizes a different file naming scheme as well, making pattern matching of
file names (called grepping) difficult. Importantly, the IRS treats non-migrants and total
migrants differently in the seven legacy formats. For 1990 and 1991, the IRS simply has a
field that reads “County Non-Migrants” for non-migrants; for 1992-1994, the IRS introduced
a State code 63 but two different County codes (010 for 1992 and 1994 and 050 for 1993)
creating a 5-digit FIPS code of 63010 or 63050. After 1995, the IRS wisely set the origin
FIPS equal to the destination FIPS for non-migrants. Lastly, Total Migrants are treated
differently too. For 1990 and 1991, the destination field simply reads “Total Migration.”
For 1992-1994, the IRS introduced a State Code 00 and county code 001 for total migrants.
After 1995, the IRS used State Code 96 and county Code 000 for a combined 5-digit FIPS
code of 96000. Figure 2 shows some sample extracts of the raw IRS migration data for 1990,
1993, 1997, and 2010.
Table 3 highlights additional differences that are of interest to the data we produce here.
Total Migrants, ie FIPS 96000 for migration data after 1995, is also broken down into Total
Mig - US (FIPS 97000), Total Mig - US Same State (FIPS 97001), Total Mig - US Diff St
(FIPS 97003), and Total Mig - Foreign (FIPS 98000). As Table 3 shows, the IRS did not code
these migration flows in this manner for all years. Additionally, the IRS treated migrants
to non-specific destinations (ie, “Region: Midwest”) differently across the entire data series.
For example, in 1992 the IRS codes migrants to a different state as FIPS 63011 for Region
1: Northeast and provides a two digit State identification code as “XX”. By 1995, the IRS
had standardized these codes to either 58000 for “Other Flows - Same State” and 59001 for
“Other FLows - Northeast” and provides two digit state identification codes of “SS” for same
state and “DS” for different state. Likewise, the IRS treats migration to foreign locations in
a similar manner.
For simplicity and data continuity purposes, we simply create a new origin/destination
(FIPS 99999) that contains all unspecified migration flows. We do this by subtracting the
number of enumerated migrants (the migration flows with greater than 10 migrants) from

the total number of migrants. This way, the sum of all enumerated migrants in our dataset
will equal the total number of migrants in the IRS dataset. And the sum of all migrants
and non-migrants for any origin in a given year should roughly approximate the county
population estimate for the previous year.
The aggregation to FIPS 99999 is the only mathematical post-processing of the IRS data.

R Code
The R code used to produce these data is available in the Supplementary Materials and in
an online repository4 . The code makes use of multi-core processing to speed up computation
time. There are three main sections in the code: A setup section; a data download section;
and a data processing section. The final flat file, county_migration_data.txt, contains
the # of exemptions and can be either downloaded at github or produced by running the R
code.

Setup
The script 000-libraries.R simply sets up the R workspace to facilitate the data processing. The appropriate R packages are downloaded and installed if the user does not
already have these packages installed. The parallel computing environment is also set up as
DetectCores() - 1 to ensure the computer has appropriate resources for other tasks. The
4

script requires a single reference tab separated (tsv) file in this section and we load it into
the local environment. ref_state.tsv contains FIPS code information for US states. we
simply add an additional FIPS state code for ‘unknown’ and assign it FIPS state 99.

Data Download
The script 001-download_data.R will download and unzip the migration data from the IRS’
websites into a folder standardized format into subdirectory MigData/. The IRS data is in
two primary formats: 1990-2003 and 2004-onward. The IRS includes eight files in their zip
archives that contain no data (these are in years 1998, 1999, 2000, and 2001). We delete
these files after downloading and unzipping them. If they are not deleted, they will cause the
subsequent for loops to fail in the next section. These files do not contain any migration
information, their names suggest they represent aggregation of migration flows (for example
‘co990usi.xls’ suggests county (co) years 1999-2000 (990) for US (us) in-migration (i)), and
we are unsure exactly why the IRS included these files or their purpose.

Data Processing
The third and final section contains several foreach parallel processing loops to process
the seven legacy formats into a common data format. These files are then row-bound using
rbindlist and transformed into a ‘short’ data frame. Table 2 demonstrates the general file
layout. We process the in- and out-migration files separately and keep only unique dyadic
pairs in the final flat file.
