Abstract

27
28

Despite positive associations between active grandparenting and well-being, little evidence so

29

far suggests that the transition to grandparenthood increases well-being. We extend previous

30

work from Europe, where weak effects were found, in two ways. First, kin effects are likely to

31

be context-dependent and differ by the type and generosity of the welfare state, and by mortality

32

rates. Second, it may be that the grandparent derives more benefits from the grandchild as

33

young child than a new-born or infant. We retest this hypothesis with longitudinal data from

34

the US and England. Both these studies follow people for a longer time so we further test

35

whether effects of grandparenting emerge later after the birth of the grandchild. We found no

36

evidence for these hypotheses in either setting, with the exception of English women who

37

reported higher subjective life expectancy after becoming a grandmother. These largely null

38

findings have implications for theories of grandparenting.

Introduction

51

Research on grandparenting largely suggests that there are benefits to the subjective well-

52

being of both the grandchild and the grandparent (1–4), although not always, (5). Most of this

53

research is based on the premise that active, hands-on grandparenting is the mechanism

54

behind the positive association for grandparents. While active grandparenting may be

55

advantageous, we know very little about the impact of the life transition to grandparenthood.

56
57

Evolutionary and sociological theories of grandparenting predict that there should be

58

beneficial impact on well-being when becoming a new grandparent but there is, so far, little

59

evidence to support this claim, at least among welfare states in Europe (6). Here, we extend

60

this literature and make two new contributions. First, we test the relationship between

61

becoming a first-time grandparent and subjective well-being (measured as depressive

62

symptoms, and subjective life expectancy) using data from two countries where this has not

63

yet been studied on a large scale; England and the US. Second, we test for associations over

64

longer time-periods to investigate if the benefits to grandparenthood are delayed, to help

65

understand previously reported weak and null results.

66
67

Background

68

The empirical evidence with regard to the general hypothesis that there is a positive effect of

69

becoming a new grandparent, is still at an early stage. Only a few studies have examined this

70

specific hypothesis, and mostly in small samples or in qualitative designs. Qualitative work

71

from Scotland suggests that there should be a positive impact of becoming a grandparent

72

quoting new grandparents giving reasons such as the meaning grandchildren give to one’s

73

life, and having something to live for (7). People reported expecting to become grandparents

74

once their own children married; the older generation expressed happiness and having
3

75

something to look forward to. On the other hand, those who did not become grandparents

76

spoke of their disappointment. These personal interviews also suggest that older individuals

77

gain status among their peers on becoming a grandparent. Similarly, one small longitudinal

78

study of 103 individuals from the US reports that prospective grandparents expect satisfaction

79

with the grandparent role (8).

80
81

In a recent study, Sheppard and Monden (9) investigated the association between becoming a

82

grandparent and subjective well-being in 15 countries across Europe and found little evidence

83

for an effect. Given the findings from the studies mentioned above which suggest that there is

84

a positive association, it is surprising that in this large multi-national study there was very

85

little supporting evidence. Their study was able to take advantage of the longitudinal nature

86

of the data and employ a strong analytical design; within-person fixed effects models that

87

control for unobserved heterogeneity. The majority of the literature that examines the

88

influence of grandparental care on either grandparent or grandchild outcomes uses cross-

89

sectional data which may be particularly problematic when using subjective measures such as

90

self-reported well-being. Fixed effects models provide a more stringent test of changes in

91

well-being by comparing the individual’s well-being over time, before and after the event,

92

controlling for time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity. Recently there has been a call for

93

more rigorous methods to address questions about grandparenting (10) especially as the few

94

studies that do use fixed effects models have found that associations reported in cross-

95

sectional models disappear (11,12). Given the small number of longitudinal studies that

96

examine the transition to grandparenthood it would be premature, however, to conclude that

97

theories predicting a positive effect of becoming a grandparent have been refuted.

98

4

99

There are at least two possible explanations for the previous weak or null findings that do not

100

require us to dismiss the general hypothesis altogether: (a) the study period in the European

101

analysis (9) might have been too short to detect associations if the benefits to becoming a

102

grandparent only emerge when the grandchild is a few years older, and (b) the effect of

103

becoming a grandparent may be highly context-specific and difficult to detect in wealthy

104

European welfare states. In other words, in other contexts the positive effects of the transition

105

to grandparenthood may be stronger. We address both issues by re-examining the transition

106

to grandparenthood hypothesis using panel data with more waves and in two new settings.

107

The US sample also allows us to test our hypothesis among Black Americans who suffer

108

higher mortality than the rest of the population.

109
110

Sheppard and Monden (9) used three waves from the Survey of Health and Ageing in Europe

111

(SHARE) to model the transition to grandparenthood. As a consequence, first time

112

grandparents were observed shortly after the transition when their first grandchild was still a

113

new-born or infant. Only in a small number of cases where grandparents observed when their

114

grandchild was a toddler (1-3) or young child (3 and older). It is plausible that the benefits to

115

becoming a first-time grandparent are only observed once the grandchild is no longer a baby

116

but is a little older and less dependent on its parents. In historical Québec, for instance, Jan

117

Beise (2005) found that having a maternal grandmother was associated with improved child

118

survival but only after the child was a year old, and less attached to its mother than very

119

young, often breastfeeding, infants are. Although this study is from the grandchild’s

120

perspective, it suggests that perhaps the payoffs to the grandparent also come later, once the

121

infant is less vulnerable and the grandparents can enjoy different types of interactions. Here

122

we are able to test this hypothesis as we have data for much longer time periods than the

123

SHARE data used in the European study (6).
5

124
125

The studies discussed so far (besides the one from Québec) are from low-risk family

126

contexts; child survival and maternal health are not at stake in high-income countries. In low-

127

risk contexts, grandparents are expected to provide so-called ‘soft benefits’ (e.g.

128

psychological well-being) – grandparents should improve grandchild well-being and

129

themselves reap such rewards. It is possible therefore that we would only detect positive

130

associations in higher-risk situations (14). Poverty can create high-risk scenarios, even in

131

wealthier states, where socioeconomic inequality is high. Perhaps grandparents are more

132

effective in needy situations and we might only find evidence for an effect on their well-

133

being under these particularly difficult circumstances. This would also make sense if high

134

levels grandparental investment evolved in a much harsher conditions (more on this in the

135

theory section). Among the US Black population both adult (15) and infant mortality is

136

relatively high. In 2013 the infant mortality rate for Black Americans was 11.2 (out of 1000

137

live births) while the same statistic for White Americans was just 5 (16). The US is an

138

interesting context for other reasons too; a lack of universal health-care insurance, and a

139

limited welfare state with less parental leave and poorer access to high-quality child care,

140

increases the wealth divide further. This contrasts with Europe where wealth inequality is less

141

pronounced and citizens have access to subsidised health care and other welfare state

142

benefits, including paid parental leave (although there is variation across Europe too). Here

143

we use US data to investigate if there are differences in the transition to grandparenthood and

144

subjective well-being between Black and White Americans.

145
146

Theoretical framework

147

Ultimate (adaptive) and proximate (mechanistic) theories of grandparenting predict beneficial

148

outcomes associated with becoming a grandparent. Evolutionary reasoning provides an
6

149

adaptive explanation for the long post-reproductive lifespan observed in humans. Human

150

females produce multiple highly-dependent offspring in quick succession compared to other

151

primates. This means that mothers need help raising offspring, and this confers a fitness

152

advantage to kin-helpers such as grandparents (17). Maternal help comes from both kin and

153

non-kin networks but grandparents, and especially grandmothers, are of great importance,

154

although there are differences by lineage (18). Evolutionary theory predicts that the maternal

155

grandmother should be of the most assistance and have the most to gain by alloparenting.

156

Behaviours such as helping kin (and non-kin) are reinforced by a reward system; nepotistic

157

effort is an important “life effort” in later life and is therefore perceived as highly rewarding

158

(19). We would expect therefore that becoming a grandparent is associated with both

159

improved subjective well-being and possibly also longevity. Indeed, some evidence for

160

increased longevity has been found in Norway (20) where becoming a grandmother after the

161

age of 50 only, was associated with lowered mortality compared with those parents who

162

remained grandchildless, although for men the found that there was a mortality penalty to

163

being a grandfather. In Germany too, Hilbrand et al. (2017) observed that grandparents who

164

actively took care of grandchildren lived on average five years longer compared to those who

165

did not contribute childcare, and those who were not grandparents (they did not compare by

166

gender).

167
168

Sociologists too agree that grandmothers are important kin for helping raise children: the kin-

169

keeper theory holds that women play a pivotal role in nurturing the ties that keep families

170

together (21). Kin-keeper theory emphasises the role of women’s socialisation into gender-

171

typical roles, where fulfilment of this role can have positive effects and work to strengthen

172

family networks. The prediction here is thus that women should benefit more from

173

grandparenting than men. And indeed some empirical evidence does support this gender
7

174

difference (6,8). Becoming a grandparent might also insure against future loneliness. Strong

175

family networks are argued to be beneficial to mental and physical health in older age (22–

176

24). However, these relationships might be more nuanced than this; in Germany, Pashos

177

(2016) found no effect of grandchildren on grandparents’ life satisfaction but he found that

178

they were less lonely, and that simply having grandchildren was given as a source of

179

happiness.

180
181

Another argument is that grandparenting can be understood in terms of delayed reciprocal

182

altruism. The idea is that help, or other types of investment, is provided by grandparents with

183

the expectation that later in life, when they need it, the grandchildren (or their parents) return

184

the investment (26). This is contrary to evolutionary reasoning that predicts investment to

185

flow down the generations, not upwards. Evolutionary theory regards the relative

186

reproductive value of the recipient; there is no fitness benefit to investing in the post-

187

reproductive generation when in fact the fitness of the younger family members would be

188

reduced (by definition there is a cost to investment), as well as the inclusive fitness of the

189

grandparents (27). Further to this, Frans de Waal (28) argues that the delay between the

190

altruistic act and the payback is too long to motivate reciprocally altruistic behaviour. He

191

argues instead that empathy is the mechanism that promotes pro-social behaviour –

192

grandparents care about their children’s and grandchildren’s well-being because their

193

empathic understanding motivates them to attend to their family’s needs which in turn

194

produces psychological benefits from giving support. The prediction to both these arguments

195

is that we should not find gender differences in well-being between grandparents.

196
197

Although these theoretical perspectives pertain to grandparental investment, by either active

198

grandparenting or by investing in material ways, simply becoming a grandparent, in
8

199

expectation of active grandparenting should nevertheless also instil feelings of hope,

200

happiness and solicitude towards the new grandchild and the new parents. In summary, we

201

expect that there should be a positive impact of becoming a first-time grandparent on

202

subjective well-being, and that women might benefit more than men. We further hypothesise

203

that this association might only be observable after some period of time, i.e. once the

204

grandchild is a few years older. In addition, in the US where we can explore harsher

205

conditions (less generous welfare state and higher infant mortality among the Black

206

population), we expect there to be a stronger, or more easily observed influence on

207

grandparents’ well-being.

208
209

Materials and Methods

210

Data and samples

211

We use data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) collected biennially in the US

212

comprising an analytical sample of 4,732 (54% female) of whom 2,061 (1,097 women and

213

964 men) became a grandparent within the study period. The data we used from the English

214

Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA), also collected biennially, is comprised of 4,675

215

respondents, of which 1,964 (1,024 women, and 940 men) became new grandparents. A

216

detailed description of the data and the sample selection process are provided in the

217

supplementary material.

218
219

Analytical strategy

220

Within-person fixed effects methods are most appropriate for estimating the effects of an

221

event on subjective well-being for two primary reasons. First, longitudinal data allow the

222

measurement of a baseline level of subjective well-being and for a comparison to be drawn

223

between that individual’s own measure of well-being at a later stage. As such we avoid
9

224

comparing subjective well-being across individuals. Subjective well-being is, by definition,

225

particular to an individual and comparing across cases leaves too much scope for finding

226

differences where the differences are not substantive but merely a product of people’s

227

subjective ideas of what something like sad or happy means to them. Secondly, fixed effects

228

models are able to adjust for unobserved time-invariant confounders.

229
230

The measurement of the event is simply that an individual goes from being a non-grandparent

231

to becoming a grandparent between two consecutive waves, i.e. they report having no

232

grandchildren at one wave (time = -1) and report having one (or more) grandchildren at the

233

next wave (time = 0). For descriptive statistics, we assigned non-grandparents (i.e. those who

234

did not transition) to a randomly allocated time of event (t=0). Due to very small numbers of

235

survey respondents who are observed at the ends of the study period (i.e. many years before

236

or after the event), we truncated the time span at five years on each side of the event.

237
238

Variables:

239

CES-D scale of depressive symptoms

240

Both surveys collect data with a battery of questions regarding depressive symptoms. The

241

Centre for Epidemiologic Studies of Depression scale (CES-D) is an 8-item score which is

242

the sum of the number of depressive symptoms reported. It is commonly used and is

243

reasonably comparable to the Euro-D scale that was used in the SHARE study, although

244

formal tests of their comparative value have shown that risk factors for CES-D tend to be a

245

little stronger than for Euro-D (29).

246
247

Subjective life expectancy

10

248

This is a measure of people’s expected survival chances over the following ten to fifteen

249

years. In ELSA, the question is posed as “what is the expectation (%) that you will live to

250

[age]?” ELSA uses a slightly different set of ages than the HRS, in particular, the ages used

251

by ELSA range from 75-120 while the ages used in the HRS range from 80-100. Specifically,

252

in ELSA, respondents are asked the probability (%) of living to 75 if the respondent is under

253

65; the probability of living to 80 if the respondent is aged 66 to 69; etc. for 5-year age

254

intervals until age 109, and finally the probability of living to 120 if the respondent is aged

255

110-119.

256
257

We also control for the potential confounders of age, marital status, and employment status in

258

the models, as these can vary over time.

259
260

Results

261

Table 1 presents the means and proportions for all variables for those who became a new

262

grandparent during the survey period, at the time before the event (i.e. time -1), and for those

263

who did not become a grandparent having a randomly-assigned time of event. Table 2 gives

264

results for fixed effects models of the association between becoming a new grandparent and

265

CES-D scores and subjective life expectancy, for men and women from both datasets. Table

266

2 also shows results from random effects models and Hausman tests, for comparison. The

267

Hausman tests show that in all cases, the fixed effects approach was the appropriate model.

268

Overall, our results from the fixed effects models show little convincing evidence that

269

becoming a grandparent is associated with improved subjective well-being. Only in the case

270

of subjective life expectancy, but only for women, and only in England, was positively and

271

significantly associated with becoming a grandparent. These findings are almost identical to

272

the findings from the European study that we are replicating (6). The CES-D score for HRS
11

273

women is also marginally significant (p=0.049) but we do not want to give much weight to this association as it does not stand up to robustness

274

tests in the other analyses (with age of grandchild and ethnicity, as shown in tables 3 and 4).

To investigate whether the impact of becoming a grandparent might only be discernible after
a longer period of time (i.e. when the baby is older), we included an interaction term for time
after the birth, set at two years in each case. Table 3 shows that there is no compelling
evidence for differences between grandparent well-being in the first two years of being a
grandparent, and later, after two years from the birth of the grandchild. In table 3, the
coefficients can be interpreted as the direction and magnitude of the association between
becoming a grandparent and subjective well-being, first for the first two years after the baby
arrives, and then for the time thereafter. The p-value given is for the difference between those
two associations. There is one significant interaction for English men’s subjective life
expectancy: it decreases in the first two years but once the grandchild is more than two years
13

old, grandfathers report higher survival chances; neither of these associations are significant
from zero but the difference between them is significant. Overall, therefore the evidence for
delayed effects is weak and so we are confident that this is not the reason for previous work
not observing any associations. Results for other ages show similar findings; available in the
supplementary material (table S1).

We also hypothesised that perhaps grandparental effects are only discernible where need is
more pronounced. In the US, Black Americans have higher mortality (both adult and infant)
than do Whites, and are generally worse off than the general population. We expected
therefore to find differences based on ethnicity among in our American sample. However,

Robustness tests
A potential limitation of this study (and to the SHARE study) is that these data come from
surveys of ageing. This means that participants are selected on age – in each of these datasets,
and in SHARE, only over-50-year-olds are surveyed (and sometimes their younger partners).
Given that we select our sample on those who were not yet grandparents when they entered
the survey, we eliminate a substantial proportion of the population who were already
grandparents by age 50. In Europe, becoming a grandparent happens during early to midfifties, but during the late forties is not unusual, with the median age being 51 years. In the
US, becoming a grandparent is an even earlier event with the national median age being 49
years (30). In this study, we are therefore limited by our sample comprising those who
become grandparents a little later than average. It is difficult to know exactly how this might
influence our findings but it is likely then that these participants were a little older when
becoming parents and/or their children were a little older when they became new parents.
15

Later reproduction is associated with higher education, and although this is accounted for by
using fixed effects analyses, we caution that our findings can only be generalised to this
demographic range. To reassure ourselves that this bias does not affect our substantive
conclusions, we further replicated these analyses using data from the UK Household
Longitudinal Survey (UKHLS), which collects data from people of all ages. The data are not
perfect for these analyses as the question about grandchildren is only asked in every other
wave, and the outcome variables are slightly different because they use answers from the
General Health Survey to derive a well-being scale. Nevertheless, the data are comparable in
every other way. In the UKHLS, 12% of men and 11% of women became grandparents over
the study period out of 24,429 respondents who were at risk (23% of all new grandparents
were aged under 50). In the UKHLS, we found the same results; no evidence for an effect of
becoming a new grandparent on subjective well-being. These results are available in the
supplementary material (table S2).

It is also possible that associations may only be detectable for some subsamples in the data.
We tested if employment status (at the birth of the grandchild, t=0) made a difference by
including an interaction term for employment status in the models. Although we found no
significant associations in the US data, we do see an interaction in the ELSA data; but only
for subjective life expectancy: working men reported lower values of expected survival
chances (but non-significant) while non-working (retired and otherwise not in the labour
force) men had higher survival expectations (see table S3 in the supplementary material). We
also tested if grandparental status was conditional on loneliness; perhaps associations are
strongest for lonely people, but again we found no supporting evidence here. In the US, we
might expect to find regional differences (Southerners are arguably more family-orientated)
and other ethnic differences (e.g. Hispanics might differ from the rest of the population) but
16

when we tested for both of these, we still find no statistically significant associations. All of
these results are available in the supplementary material (table S3). Finally, we re-ran the
models with further controls for self-reported health and non-housing wealth to aid
comparison with the SHARE study but this did not change our findings either (table S4). The
results of all these robustness checks give us confidence that our results really do reflect a
lack of, or at least a very weak association between the transition to grandparenthood and
subjective well-being.

Discussion
So why would becoming a grandparent not be associated with well-being? We presented two
possible reasons why data from Europe showed only weak evidence for an effect: the study
was over a relatively short time period, and that perhaps grandparent well-being might only
be visible after a few years, when the child is a little older. We posited too that perhaps
grandparents might benefit more in higher-risk contexts. In this study, we replicated those
weak (and null) findings using data from England and the US. These data, collected over a
longer period, allowed us to examine the likelihood of delayed affects as well as, for the
American sample at least, if effects are discernible for higher-risk groups. We discuss these in
turn.

Delayed effect
In both datasets, we tested for evidence for an interaction with the baby’s age (at two years
after the birth) and found largely that this was not the case. We are thus fairly confident that
the effects of becoming a grandparent are not dependent on the age of the grandchild. Perhaps
this indicates that face-to-face contact with the grandchildren is necessary to have an
association with grandparent well-being, and that the transition to grandparenthood is not in
17

itself strong enough to have an effect. The association between spending time babysitting
new grandchildren and grandparent wellbeing was however tested in the European study but
there was no support for this argument (6). In the same data (SHARE), and using an
instrumental variable approach, Arpino and Bordone (31) also found little evidence that
grandparents who provided childcare were better off in terms of cognitive function.

Low-risk context
Perhaps the problem is that all these studies and indeed much of the literature on active
grandparenting is taken from high-income settings where risk is low (14). If the grandmother
hypothesis is correct then the female post-reproductive lifespan, and high levels of
cooperation, evolved under much harsher conditions than the grandparents in these studies
face. Child survival and maternal health are much less salient in industrialised countries, and
so perhaps the importance of grandparenting is less visible here too. Modern grandparents
might offset risks when they are high, such as when very young motherhood occurs, and
especially if the father is not present. One literature that does show strong benefits to
grandchildren is where grandparents take on custodial roles, where for whatever reason the
middle generation cannot cope with parenthood, grandparents (especially grandmothers) are
beneficial for helping to raise the grandchild. Unfortunately, these circumstances tend to have
a negative effect on grandparents’ well-being (32). A natural extension of this work would be
to widen it to low-income settings where harsher conditions might make grandparental
advantage more visible. Although in such settings the costs to grandparenting are also higher
and so we might not predict a higher payoff to the grandparents, only the grandchildren and
possibly the middle generation.

Subjective life expectancy
18

We did find an association between becoming a grandmother and subjective life expectancy,
but only in England and only for women, as was found in the SHARE study. Without
overemphasising this finding, if this is a true effect then it supports the kin-keeper theory of
grandparenting, which predicts that women should benefit more from grandparenting. It
would also support the findings of one study that looked at actual mortality, where
grandmothers (over 50 years old), although not grandfathers, had lowered mortality (20).
The evolutionary-based grandmother hypothesis would also predict women living longer if
they are grandmothers (33) because the argument is specifically to do with the adaptiveness
of the post-reproductive lifespan (menopause) which does not directly apply to men. It is
thought that the male lifespan extended in our evolutionary past as an adaptation to female
lifespan extension. Unlike for women where reproductive costs are very high, the costs to
male reproduction are low and so early cessation of the male reproductive career is unlikely
to be selected against (17, 34).

Conclusion
Does becoming a grandparent improve subjective well-being? Our study with data from
England and the US replicated the findings observed in Europe, that this is not the case. Tests
for a delayed association with well-being, or that high-risk contexts might explain these
results proved fruitless. Evolutionary and sociological theories of grandparenting suggest that
there should be benefits to becoming a grandparent, as does the qualitative research on this
topic, but perhaps true associations will only be discernible in harsher contexts such as subSaharan Africa, where the costs and benefits to prosocial care are more consequential.
