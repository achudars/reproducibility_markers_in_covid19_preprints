Abstract
As the rental housing market moves online, the Internet offers divergent possible
futures: either the promise of more-equal access to information for previously marginalized homeseekers, or a reproduction of longstanding information inequalities. Biases
in online listings’ representativeness could impact different communities’ access to
housing search information, reinforcing traditional information segregation patterns
through a digital divide. They could also circumscribe housing practitioners’ and researchers’ ability to draw broad market insights from listings to understand rental supply
and affordability. This study examines millions of Craigslist rental listings across the
US and finds that they spatially concentrate and over-represent whiter, wealthier, and
better-educated communities. Other significant demographic differences exist in age,
language, college enrollment, rent, poverty rate, and household size. Most cities’ online
housing markets are digitally segregated by race and class, and we discuss various implications for residential mobility, community legibility, gentrification, housing voucher
utilization, and automated monitoring and analytics in the smart cities paradigm. While
Craigslist contains valuable crowdsourced data to better understand affordability and
available rental supply in real-time, it does not evenly represent all market segments.
The Internet promises information democratization, and online listings can reduce
housing search costs and increase choice sets. However, technology access/preferences
and information channel segregation can concentrate such information-broadcasting
benefits in already-advantaged communities, reproducing traditional inequalities and
reinforcing residential sorting and segregation dynamics. Technology platforms like
Craigslist construct new institutions with the power to shape spatial economies, human
interactions, and planners’ ability to monitor and respond to urban challenges.

1. Introduction
Large portions of the rental housing market have moved online over the past decade. Today,
rental listings are primarily posted on websites like Craigslist, which holds a predominant
position in the US as its 15th overall most-visited website. According to the 2017 American
Housing Survey, more renters in urbanized areas found their current homes through a site like
Craigslist than through any other information channel. Housing practitioners and researchers,
in turn, increasingly collect online listings to assess market supply in the smart cities paradigm
of monitoring urban conditions through streams of user-generated data (Boeing et al., 2019;
Hu et al., 2019).
Although online listings have recently become a primary mode of information exchange in
US rental housing markets, little is known about how they function or how well they actually
represent the full market (Boeing and Waddell, 2017; Schachter and Besbris, 2017; Besbris
et al., 2018). If online listings are not representative—i.e., if sampling biases exist—what
kinds of communities are over- or under-represented? Biases impact information equity and
housing search costs as well as the conclusions that housing researchers and policymakers can
draw about the real world from crowdsourced data (McLaughlin and Young, 2018; Arribas-Bel
and Bakens, 2018; Folch et al., 2018; Narayanan and MacDonald, 2019). Yet little is currently
known about spatial patterns or biases in the rental listings that compose these information
landscapes and shape housing search outcomes.
This study assesses online rental market representativeness at the census tract scale, using
a dataset of millions of Craigslist listings across the US. It explores the sociodemographics
of over- and under-represented tracts and estimates spatial regression models to examine
these traits’ relationships with representation. It finds that listings are spatially concentrated
and over-represent whiter, wealthier, and better-educated tracts. Majority-White tracts are
over-represented more than twice as often as Hispanic or Black tracts. Although large swaths
of this market are affordable to low-to-moderate income and Black families, homeseekers
in whiter, wealthier, better-educated, and more-expensive communities have a surplus of
information available online to aid their searches while seekers in other communities face a
digital information deficit. The Internet helps democratize access to information but it does
not necessarily equalize its supply. As the rental housing market moves online, technological
self-selection and information supply biases construct new digital inequalities that shape
housing search costs, choice sets, residential sorting, and the conclusions planners can draw
about rapidly-evolving markets.

2. Inequality in the Housing Information Landscape
Housing technology platforms today forge emerging institutions with the capacity to reshape
urban economies, human interactions, and information landscapes. (Wegmann and Jiao, 2017;
Shaw, 2018; Kim et al., 2019; Fields, 2019; Jiao and Bai, 2019). These information landscapes—
and any asymmetries or segregation within them—are central to housing search outcomes

2

and residential sorting (Levitt and Syverson, 2008; Kurlat and Stroebel, 2015; Garmaise and
Moskowitz, 2004; Metzger et al., 2019; Ben-Shahar and Golan, 2019).
Prospective renters heterogeneously rely on a constellation of information sources to
identify available units, including websites, newspapers, agents/brokers, property for-rent
signs, and word of mouth. Krysan and Crowder (2017) theorize a two-stage search process
in which homeseekers decide which neighborhoods to search and then choose which units
within them to consider, emphasizing the importance of information supplies. Rae (2015)
contends that the Internet has emerged as the first port of call for such searches, but online
information also impacts the second stage by rendering individual units and in turn neighborhoods more legible and accessible to seekers. As the Internet constitutes an ever-increasing
share of the rental housing information supply, different communities’ access to information
and capacity to find housing depend both on listings’ representativeness and communities’
abilities/interests in engaging with these platforms. This can be considered from the supplyside (i.e., the supply of information by landlords, managers, and brokers) and the demand-side
(i.e., homeseekers’ Internet usage and search preferences).
On the supply-side, information about available housing units for rent traditionally
appeared in local newspaper classifieds. Today, however, Craigslist has become the foremost
such venue in the US, even as potential competitors like Facebook, Zillow, and Trulia try
to challenge its near monopoly in online listings (Hau, 2006; Brown, 2014; Seamans and
Zhu, 2014; Kroft and Pope, 2014; Yurieff, 2017). Researchers have increasingly turned to
Craigslist listings to study individual metropolitan markets (e.g., Besbris et al., 2018; Brown
et al., 2017; Im et al., 2017; Halket and Pignatti Morano di Custoza, 2015; Mallach, 2010;
Palm, 2018; Schachter and Besbris, 2017; Wegmann and Chapple, 2012). Most studies of
demographic representation on Craigslist have focused on discrimination by landlords (e.g.,
Hanson and Santas, 2014; Carlsson and Eriksson, 2014; Evans et al., 2018; Murchie and
Pang, 2018) and the Fair Housing Act (e.g., Larkin, 2010; Oliveri, 2010). Boeing and Waddell
(2017) examined Craigslist listings across the US, concluding further research was needed to
understand sociodemographic submarket representativeness.
On the demand-side, who consumes this online supply of information about available
rental units? Online housing search depends on Internet access and usage. The rise in Internet
ubiquity over the past two decades has been accompanied by concerns about a digital divide
between information “haves” and “have-nots” (Hersberger, 2003; Riddlesden and Singleton,
2014). This divide may result from cultural differences or social inequalities: age, race, wealth,
and education impact exposure and access to technology as well as attitudes, skills, and cultural
norms in usage (Jones et al., 2009; Robinson et al., 2015). Younger, whiter, better-educated,
and higher-income Americans have higher Internet usage rates than other groups (Porter and
Donthu, 2006). Internet use and search engine behavior vary among different racial groups
and as a function of native language (Slate et al., 2002; Weber and Jaimes, 2011). Older adults
are less likely to use the Internet, and this effect is more pronounced among those who are
low-income, Black, or Hispanic (Choi and DiNitto, 2013). The race gap is closing, however,
and as of 2018, 89% of White adults used the Internet versus 88% of Hispanic and 87% of

3

Black adults, but usage remains lower today among older, less-educated, and lower-income
Americans (Pew Research Center, 2018, 2019).
It is less clear how this translates to housing search: different communities may prefer different information sources as a function of age, education, language, community ties, access to
technology, and prior experiences with steering or discrimination. Pre-Internet, Newburger
(1995) found that Black homebuyers relied on fewer information sources than Whites did,
possibly due to housing information being harder to acquire in Black neighborhoods. Farley
(1996) found that Blacks relied more on social ties and newspaper ads to find housing than
Whites did, due to longstanding practices of real estate agents providing more information to
White than Black homeseekers and steering them toward different neighborhoods. These
agents also concentrate in Whiter and wealthier neighborhoods, focusing their services and
benefits in already-advantaged communities (Besbris and Faber, 2017). Beyond race, DeBoer
(1985) argued that elderly homeseekers face higher search costs, more-constrained radii,
and fewer information resources than younger seekers: these information asymmetries and
inequalities produce housing market disequilibrium, with overpayment rates correlated with
seeker characteristics (cf. Desmond and Perkins, 2016; Desmond and Wilmers, 2019).
Do online housing markets attenuate these traditional information supply disparities or
do they reproduce historical patterns of information segregation, steering, and sorting? As
Stephens (2013, p. 993) argues, geospatial web platforms and technologies often “reproduce
and exacerbate existing representational asymmetries” in the real world (cf. Elwood, 2010;
Mattern, 2014; Thatcher et al., 2016; Leszczynski, 2016; Brannon, 2017). Demographics and
social networks shape our housing information supplies, producing neighborhood “blindspots” and gaps in knowledge (Krysan and Bader, 2009). Thus, information democratization
and diversity on platforms like Craigslist could help expand and equalize residential searches.
Krysan and Crowder (2017) argue that broadening such information sources—including
rental search engine results—would expand homeseeker choice sets, in turn lessening the
sociostructural factors that guide residential sorting (cf. Sampson and Sharkey, 2008; Steil
and Jordan, 2018). While the Internet could offer information-disadvantaged homeseekers
more information for their searches, it remains unclear if this potential has been realized
(Palm and Danis, 2001; Decker, 2010). Besbris et al. (2018) found that the volume and type
of information appearing in neighborhoods’ Craigslist listings vary by demographics, with
seekers in White- or Asian-majority neighborhoods receiving more information per listing
than those in Black or Hispanic neighborhoods. Krysan (2008, p. 598) found that Blacks were
significantly less likely to use the Internet to search for housing than Whites, concluding:
“Given the rapid growth of the Internet in renting and selling housing, the observed racial
digital divide is a point of some concern.”
These studies of representation and participation mainly focus on demand. The representativeness of available rental housing supply online remains underexplored, yet it could impact
equity in multiple ways. First, if Internet usage differs between demographic groups—and if
certain kinds of communities appear more in online rental listings—neighborhood segregation could be perpetuated through information channel segregation and self-selection: forms
of sociostructural steering. Second, it could reproduce longstanding housing information
4

inequalities as new digital inequalities, where privileged communities obtain surpluses of
relevant housing information—lessening their search costs—while others face relative deficits.
Third, these information supplies could make certain units or neighborhoods more legible and
accessible to homeseekers—with implications for gentrification, displacement, and housing
voucher utilization.

3. Methods
3.1. Data

Due to its predominance in this information landscape today, Craigslist provides a powerful
data source for studying the representativeness of online housing markets. This technology
platform and the listings it contains shape human market behaviors while chronicling them
for researchers. This study uses it to investigate if online rental listings over- or underrepresent different communities and how community characteristics explain supply-side
representativeness.
The study sites comprise the 12,505 census tracts within the core municipalities of the
50 most populous US metropolitan statistical areas, ignoring tracts that contain no rental
units. We adopt the dataset of Craigslist rental housing listings collected in 2014 by Boeing
and Waddell (2017), which was filtered to remove duplicates and retain only geolocated
listings, resulting in a set of 1.4 million listings (see ibid. for a detailed explanation of the
collection/cleaning process, along with summary statistics of each step).
Next we spatially join these tracts and rental listings then attach 2014 American Community Survey (ACS) tract-level data (Table 1). Although landlords, not neighborhoods, are the
agents of interest, tract-level data offer the finest-scale approximation. The ACS is a sample
survey, not an enumeration, and provides average rental vacancy rates rather than snapshots
of vacancies at specific times.1 However, no existing dataset does so at sub-metropolitan
scales. US Postal Service vacancy data provide finer spatial granularity, but crucially lack
tenure information. Despite imperfections, the ACS offers the best data available to explore
these questions by comparing average vacancy rates over time to Craigslist’s aggregate listing
volumes over time.
3.2. Assessing Representation

We tally how many listings appear in each tract as count κ. This represents the empirical/observed distribution. The ACS provides the number of vacant units for rent, τ , in each
tract. We then calculate a proportional reallocation, φ, of these rental listings for each tract in
each city as:
φt =

κc τt
τc

(1)

where φt indicates how many of the observed Craigslist listings in city c would appear in
its tract t if these listings were redistributed across c’s tracts according to each’s proportion

of c’s total vacant units for rent. This represents the theoretical/expected distribution. We
then calculate2 each tract’s over- or under-representation on Craigslist, λ, as:
λt =

κt + 1
φt + 1

(2)

Thus, if λt = 1, tract t has the same number of rental listings on Craigslist that we would
expect if the city’s listings were redistributed among its tracts in proportion to each’s share
of the city’s total vacant rental units. Higher and lower values indicate over- and underrepresentation respectively. Finally, we calculate Gini coefficients to measure how evenly
the listings are distributed across city tracts. A coefficient of 1 indicates that a single tract
contains all of the city’s listings, while a coefficient of 0 indicates that they are perfectly evenly
distributed among all of its tracts.
3.3. Between-Group Differences

Once we have assembled the ACS data and the Craigslist representation indicator λ, we calculate variables’ differences-in-means between over-represented (λ > 1) and under-represented
(λ < 1) tracts, as well as statistical significance via t-tests and practical significance (effect
size) via Cohen’s d:
d=

µo − µ u
σp

(3)

where µo and µu are the means of the over- and under-represented tracts and σp represents their pooled standard deviation. This measures a standardized magnitude of difference
between these two groups—namely, by how many standard deviations their means differ. By
convention, a d of 0.8 or greater represents a large effect, 0.5–0.8 represents a medium effect,
0.2–0.5 a small effect, and values below 0.2 a negligible effect (Cohen, 1992).
3.4. Regression Analysis

These differences can be unpacked while controlling for inventory, turnover, and other variables that influence listing volume. To investigate the ceteris paribus associations between
Craigslist representation and different sociodemographic and built environment characteristics, we estimate a multiple regression model (Model I) via ordinary least squares (OLS):
y = β0 + β1 X1 + β2 X2 + 

(4)

where the response vector y is tract Craigslist representation (λ), β0 is the intercept, X1
is a matrix of observations on tract sociodemographic and neighborhood variables, X2 is a
matrix of city dummy variables,  is random error, and β1 and β2 are vectors of parameters
to be estimated. To correctly specify a model that is linear-in-parameters, we log-transform
the response3 and some of the predictors in X1 . Thus we can interpret the coefficients on
log-transformed predictors as elasticities (the percent change in the response given a 1%

7

increase in the predictor) and those on untransformed predictors as semi-elasticities (the
percent change in the response given a 1 unit increase in the predictor).
We control for intermetropolitan variation with X2 ’s spatial fixed effects and for rental
inventory and turnover with three variables in X1 : the count of rental units, the proportion
of the population living in the same residence as a year ago, and the rental vacancy rate.
Neighborhood character variables include the tract’s median rooms per home, proportion of
structures built before 1940, distance to the city center, and average commute time. These
control for typical building size and age as well as location centrality and job accessibility.
Sociodemographic predictors include the tract’s median household income, median gross
rent, average renter household size, the proportions of the population 20–34 years old and 65
or older, the proportion currently enrolled in college/graduate school, the proportion with a
bachelor’s or graduate degree, the proportion that speaks English-only, and the proportions
of the population that are White4 , Black, or Hispanic. The model includes an interaction
term—the White proportion × median income—to explore how race moderates the effect of
income on representation.
Finally, Model I’s diagnostics suggest the presence of spatial diffusion, so we estimate an
additional spatial lag model (Model II) via maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE):
y = ρW y + β0 + β1 X1 + β2 X2 + 

(5)

with variables defined as above, but also including W as a queen-contiguity spatial weights
matrix and ρ as the spatial autoregressive coefficient to be estimated.

4. Findings
4.1. Spatial Compression

Across these cities, the tract-level observed distribution of Craigslist listings, κ, has a Gini
coefficient of 0.80, while the expected distribution, φ, has a coefficient of 0.70—i.e., rental
listings are more spatially-concentrated than a proportional distribution would be—but this
phenomenon is uneven between cities. In four markets (San Francisco, San Jose, Oklahoma
City, and Las Vegas), the φ Gini is slightly higher (by 0.4%–7.7%) than that of κ, indicating rental
listings are slightly more dispersed. However, in St. Louis, Providence, Miami, and Hartford,
the κ Gini is 70–120% higher than that of φ, indicating an extreme spatial compression of
listings in these rental markets.
As this concentration suggests, most tracts are at least slightly under-represented on
Craigslist (i.e., λ < 1), but this varies by demographics. Overall, 52% of majority-White tracts
are over-represented, compared to only 19% of majority-Black and 22% of majority-Hispanic
tracts. Examining the racial composition of tracts with λ < 0.25 (i.e., with fewer than 25% of
the listings we expect), only 11% of majority-White tracts are as such “very” under-represented,
but 27% of Black and 35% of Hispanic tracts are.

4.2. Differences Between Over- and Under-Represented Tracts

Figures 1 and 2 illustrate descriptive patterns in how sociodemographic and other neighborhood characteristics differ significantly between over- and under-represented tracts nationwide. Figure 1 depicts the distributions of key variables, illustrating the differences between
these two groups. In particular, the White proportion’s distribution nearly inverts between
over- and under-represented tracts. Six variables’ differences demonstrate medium effect
sizes, either positive or negative (Table 25 ): median income, gross rent, the White population
proportion, the proportion with a bachelor’s/graduate degree, the proportion enrolled in
college/graduate school, the proportion below poverty, and the proportion experiencing rent
burden. Twelve more have small, significant effects. Figure 2 shows how the expected and
observed distributions of listings diverge. For instance, we expect only 33% of all listings
to appear in tracts with median income exceeding $55,000, but instead we observe 56%.
Similarly we expect majority-White tracts to contain 39% of all listings, but instead they
contain 59%.

On average compared to under-represented tracts, over-represented tracts have a White
population proportion 20 percentage-points6 (pp) higher, a Hispanic proportion 8 pp lower,
and a Black proportion 14 pp lower (Table 2). The proportion that speaks English-only is
8 pp higher and the foreign-born proportion is 4 pp lower. Average median home values
are nearly $80,000 higher, median incomes $21,000 higher, and median gross rents $200
higher. The proportion of the population with a bachelor’s/graduate degree is 17 pp higher
and the proportion currently enrolled in college/graduate school is 7 pp higher, on average.
In over-represented tracts the proportion of the population below poverty is 9 pp lower and
the rent-burdened proportion is 8 pp lower. Over-represented tracts offer shorter commutes
and have slightly lower population densities, smaller household sizes, and higher proportions
of single-unit detached housing on average.
These differences are significant, but are they consistent across cities? Although Craigslist
represents certain cities more evenly than others, some consistent patterns emerge in the
per-city differences between over- and under-represented tracts (Table 3). Average median
income is higher in over-represented tracts (i.e., d > 0) in every city, and more than 1.5 standard
deviations higher in Miami and Chicago. Rents are higher in over-represented tracts in every
city with a significant difference, and more than 1 standard deviation higher in 7 cities, again
led by Miami and Chicago. The proportion of the population with a bachelor’s/graduate
degree is higher in every city with a significant difference, and more than 1.5 standard
deviations higher in Miami, Hartford, Chicago, and New Orleans. The proportion enrolled
in college/graduate school is higher in every city with a significant difference, and more
than 1 standard deviation higher in Miami, Chicago, and Philadelphia. Similarly, the White
proportion is higher in every city with a significant difference, and more than 1 standard
deviation higher in 7 of these, led by Miami and New Orleans. However, the proportion
that speaks English-only is more divisive: while some cities have medium-sized negative
effects, many more demonstrate medium or large positive effects. Finally, the proportion
below poverty is lower in every city with a significant difference, led by Miami, Houston,
Washington, and New Orleans, and the average renter household size is lower in all but one
city (Las Vegas) with a significant difference, led by Hartford, Miami, and Boston.
4.3. Regression Results

As the two regression models tell similar stories (Table 4), we focus on Model I for interpretability.7 A ceteris paribus $10 increase in tract median rent increases representation on
Craigslist by 0.58%, a 1 pp increase in the proportion with a bachelor’s/graduate degree
increases it 1.03%, and a 1 pp increase in the proportion that speaks English-only increases
it 0.69%. A 1 pp increase in the 20–34 year old population proportion increases it by 0.41%
but a 1 pp increase in the proportion age 65 and older decreases it 0.50%. A 1% increase in
distance from the city center decreases tract representation on Craigslist by 0.12% and a 1 pp
increase in the proportion of structures built before 1940 decreases it 0.28%. Although a 1
room increase per home increases representation by 4.4%, a 1% increase in renter household
size decreases it 0.21%.

A 1 pp increase in the Black population proportion decreases representation by 0.57% and
a 1 pp increase in the Hispanic proportion decreases it 0.30%. Thus, even when controlling for
income, education, age, and language, greater shares of Black or Hispanic residents predict
lower representation in online rental listings, indicating a distinct race/ethnicity effect. Given
the interaction term, the marginal effect of income on Craigslist representation depends
on the White population proportion. When the population is 10% White, a 1% increase in
median income increases representation by 0.33%. But with a 90% White population, a 1%
increase in median income increases it by only 0.06%. Thus, higher incomes are associated
with greater online representation in less-White communities, but homogeneously White
communities tend to be represented similarly online nearly irrespective of income. Likewise,
in poorer tracts, “whiteness” has a more positive effect: when median income is $8,000, a 1
13

pp increase in the White population proportion increases Craigslist representation by 0.04%.
But when median income is $100,000, a 1 pp increase in the White proportion decreases it by
0.80%. In other words, having a larger proportion of White residents predicts greater online
representation in very poor communities, but in high-income communities it predicts lower
representation: the model’s interaction/moderation effects suggest that wealthier Whites may
be more likely to hire brokers or rely on more-exclusive listing services than the free-and-open
Craigslist platform.
Finally, we perform a series of robustness tests,8 across which we find the models tell a
consistent story, especially regarding key variables of interest. For example, the proportionBlack and proportion-Hispanic parameter estimates remain negative across these tests and
remain significant across nearly all of them. The median rent and median income parameter
estimates remain positive and significant across all the robustness tests. In other words, these
key race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status trends persist throughout various analytical
reformulations.

5. Discussion
5.1. Representativeness

These data distill the collective behavior and intentions of millions of people listing rental
units online. They do not, however, represent all market segments and activity. It becomes
essential to understand these biases as homeseekers and researchers increasingly turn to
the Internet to explore rental markets. Craigslist listings spatially concentrate more than
expected and some markets—such as Miami’s—demonstrate extreme compression. Such
cities consistently appear among those with the largest differences between over- and underrepresented tracts across multiple sociodemographic variables. Their online housing markets
are spatially concentrated and digitally segregated by race and class.
Miami’s disparities starkly illustrate this. Its average population proportion with a college degree and White proportion are both 2 standard deviations higher in over- versus
under-represented tracts. Its average median income and rent are both 1.5 standard deviations higher. On average in Miami, 51% of the population has a degree in over-represented
tracts versus only 17% in under-represented tracts. 33% versus 7% of the population is
White, household incomes are $67,000 versus $28,000, and home values are $371,000 versus
$163,000. Nationwide, tracts over-represented on Craigslist are significantly better-educated,
whiter, and wealthier than under-represented tracts. They have higher rents and larger
homes, but smaller household sizes. They contain more college students, more English-only
speakers, and fewer immigrants. Majority-White tracts are over-represented 2.4 and 2.7
times as often as Hispanic and Black tracts. Conversely, only 1 in 9 majority-White tracts is
“very” under-represented, compared to over a quarter of Black and over a third of Hispanic
tracts. Craigslist’s information-broadcasting benefits concentrate in traditionally advantaged
communities.
Controlling for confounds to disentangle relationships, we find that higher rents and
larger proportions of the population that are college-educated, aged 20–34, and speak English14

only each significantly predict greater representation on Craigslist. Newer housing stock and
more rooms per home—but smaller renter household sizes—also predict greater representation. Higher incomes have a universally positive relationship with representation, but a larger
one in tracts with higher minority populations. Finally, the key race/ethnicity effects persist
in both models and throughout the robustness tests: larger Black and Hispanic shares of the
population consistently predict lower representation in online rental listings.
5.2. Digital Inequality or a Redoubt of Illegibility?

Beyond identifying sampling biases that render certain communities less-legible to big data
analytics, these findings also contribute supply-side evidence to theories of the digital divide
and disparate housing search. For instance, the literature suggests that Black and elderly
Americans are less likely to search for housing online, and we confirm that these communities
are less-represented in online listings. Our findings on immigrants and non-English speakers
may relate to common preferences to use soft ties rather than English-language websites to
advertise or seek housing. Craigslist’s information channel dominance varies accordingly
within and between cities.
Of course, certain communities may prefer certain information channels for a variety of
reasons. But as the housing market moves online, technological self-selection among listers
and seekers reinforces the sociostructural sorting mechanisms that perpetuate neighborhood
blind-spots, residential segregation, and unequal search costs. This study identifies structural differences in this information supply between different kinds of communities, but
not why each submarket behaves differently—many factors could be simultaneously at play.
Yet it demonstrates that the spatial patterns of traditional housing information inequality
and steering are reproduced online through the segregation and asymmetry of information
supplies.
These phenomena have various implications for residential mobility, sorting, and housing
policy. As homeseekers tend to search for units in neighborhoods they are already familiar
with (Krysan and Crowder, 2017), disadvantaged communities miss out on the reduced search
costs and expanded choice sets provided by online platforms—benefits that instead primarily
accrue to already-advantaged communities. A two-tiered system emerges in which privileged
communities exchange housing information through one channel, while all others resort to
separate channels. These forces perpetuate the self-reinforcing cycles of durable inequality:
information segregation limits homeseekers’ discovery of housing in neighborhoods different
from their own—in turn limiting the ability to integrate neighborhoods for more diversity of
incomes, education levels, ages, and ethnicities (cf. Krysan and Crowder, 2017; Ellen, 2018;
Pendall, 2018; Steil and Jordan, 2018).
Conversely, another important implication is that not appearing in online listings could
be advantageous for underprivileged neighborhoods if it makes them less accessible to gentrification and displacement. That is, if these communities’ members tend to search for housing
online less than wealthier seekers do, and if available units in these neighborhoods appear
online less, they may be less discoverable to Internet-savvy outsiders. Thus, information
under-representation could shield vulnerable communities in a redoubt of digital illegibility,
15

while reciprocally making over-represented privileged communities more legible to a broad
cross-section of homeseekers who otherwise may not have acquired information about these
neighborhoods. The latter has important policy ramifications as it could expand the choice
sets of housing voucher holders seeking to move to higher-opportunity neighborhoods, if
affordable units can be found (cf. Rosen, 2014; Schwartz et al., 2017; McLaughlin and Young,
2018; Reina et al., 2019). Practitioners, for example, could take advantage of this by broadcasting eligible-unit information online or by helping voucher holders devise online search
strategies that focus on unit characteristics in higher-opportunity neighborhoods rather than
familiar geographic silos.
Finally, what about market segmentation? Concerns about digital inequality could be
assuaged if online listings match high-end housing supply and demand, while other segments
simply use a different suitable information channel instead. But, crucially, Craigslist does not
merely represent the high-end of the market. 49% of these listings are affordable (i.e., asking
rent < 30% of income) for households just below the 2014 US median household income,
and 23% of them are affordable for households just below the corresponding Black median.
Millions of Craigslist rental listings are within the reach of low-to-moderate income and Black
families—yet listings appear disproportionately infrequently in these communities. Housing
brokers historically provided different information to White and Black homeseekers: although
the Internet promises information democratization, these disparities seem to continue online.
5.3. Information Landscapes and Housing Dynamics

A critical project lies ahead in unpacking the cause-and-effect/supply-and-demand question.
Do landlords in certain communities advertise online less because they know their market
segment uses the Internet less to search for housing? Or do certain communities use the
Internet less to search for housing because of unfamiliarity, its dearth of relevant information,
or past experiences with racialized interactions? If a community member rarely finds suitable
units when she does search online, why would she continue doing so? Conversely, a relative
affinity for Internet use in wealthier, whiter, better-educated neighborhoods could stimulate
the local supply of online information. Local landlords in certain neighborhoods may prefer
to advertise online as their own Internet usage reflects that of the surrounding community.
Neighborhoods with more subsidized housing might rely on other information channels,
even other online channels such as https://gosection8.com/. Some landlords even avoid
Craigslist to deliberately filter and limit the number of potential applicants (Mendez, 2016).
Such patterns reflect path-dependent interactions of supply and demand feedback loops,
suppressing some communities’ usage while buttressing others’.
Although Craigslist does not constitute the entire online listings marketplace, it holds a
dominant market position and has uniquely low barriers to entry. However, these listings
were collected during spring and could reflect seasonal biases: future work can confirm these
findings with longer-term longitudinal data and larger sample sizes to lessen the lumpiness
of real-world volunteered geographic information. This study examined large core cities,
not wider metropolitan areas or small towns. Although many core cities contain extensive
suburban neighborhoods, the inclusion of further-flung suburbs and exurbs might change
16

estimated model parameters: future research can examine regional markets or estimate
individual local models. Finally, due to the discussed limitations of ACS vacant unit counts,
follow-up work should confirm these results with additional sources of vacancy data.
Our findings provide a first glimpse into this information landscape. This study modeled
tract-level representation, but subsequent research can investigate how demographic, neighborhood, and unit characteristics contribute to asking rents and the difference between asking
rents and corresponding ACS rents. This leads to a critical open question: do online listings
render units in disadvantaged neighborhoods more accessible to privileged homeseekers, or
does under-representation shield these communities from “colonization?” Given the substantial demographic disparities identified here, future work can explore how tracts change over
time to investigate online listings’ role in housing search efficiency and the broader dynamics
of gentrification.

6. Conclusion
If information is power in today’s cities and markets, then disparate access to it can influence
community futures, opportunities, and equity. As online platforms capture an ever-greater
share of the rental housing market’s information landscape, data sources like Craigslist offer
invaluable opportunities to understand affordability and available rental supply in real-time.
They do not, however, provide a holistic view of the market, as this information exchange
over- and under-represents certain communities.
This study developed a methodology to identify sampling biases in large harvested urban
datasets, providing a glimpse into the supply-side of digital inequality and the potential
blind-spots of smart city automated analytics. The Internet’s ability to broaden information
sources and democratize access to housing data remains contingent on landlords listing online.
Housing seekers in whiter, wealthier, better-educated, and more-expensive communities
have a surplus of relevant information online to aid their searches while seekers in other
communities face a deficit, reproducing historical patterns of information inequality. In turn,
these biases influence the reinforcing feedback loops of supply and demand in community
usage and residential sorting, as well as the conclusions that housing planners can draw by
collecting these data.

See Cresce (2012), Spielman et al. (2014), and Logan et al. (2019) for comprehensive reviews and discussion
of ACS tract-scale representativeness and limitations.
2
We add 1 to the numerator and denominator to avoid occasional division by zero and logarithm of zero.
3
Ratios lack symmetry: when κ < φ, λ ranges from 0 to 1, but when κ > φ, λ ranges from 1 to infinity. The
logarithm corrects this: when κ = φ, λ = 1 and log(λ) = 0. It produces symmetry as log(a/b) = − log(b/a).
That is, log(a/b) = log(a) − log(b), so we evaluate the algebraic difference between logarithmic values.
4
“White” and “Black” are shorthand throughout for non-Hispanic White/Black.
5
As a robustness test, we also recalculate δ in Table 2 after discarding outliers (at ±2 and ±3 standard
deviations) in each variable and λ. All values remain significant and signed in the same directions, with one
exception: distance to city center.
6
We distinguish between percentage-point differences, which are additive, and percent changes, which are
not.
7
Due to spatial diffusion, Model II’s coefficients cannot be directly interpreted as marginal effects because the
response depends on the predictors’ values at all spatially correlated locations (Anselin and Rey, 2014, p. 164).
8
These tests include re-estimating Equations 4 and 5 after: removing response variable outliers (at ±2 and
±3 standard deviations); operationalizing a location quotient as an alternative response variable (see Billings and
Johnson, 2012); filtering the tracts by various minimum-listings thresholds; adding a spatial-error term to each
equation (see Anselin and Rey, 2014); and computing an alternative distance-decay spatial weights matrix.
