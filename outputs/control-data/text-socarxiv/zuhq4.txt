The Business Model as Mediator
during Socio-Technical Transitions
Empirical Evidence from Applied AI Technology Startups in
the Energy and Transportation Sector
Firms are an important driver of socio-technical transitions, where
a technological innovation moves from a protected niche to a new
dominant socio-technical regime. The firm's business model functions as
an important mediator during this process, articulating a shared vision of
what the technology can do. Following recent calls for a closer
examination of the business model’s role during socio-technical
transitions, we study 375 startups that develop applied AI technologies.
Based on a large-scale semantic analysis of the startup’s website texts,
we ran a statistical hierarchical clustering and identified three distinct
roles: (1) expansion of the technology in scale and scope, (2) exploration
of the technology in-depth, (3) new ways of interacting with technology.

1. Introduction
Technological innovations have been the key driver for societal transitions for millennia,
changing the way we live and work ​(Brynjolfsson & Mcafee, 2017; Geels, 2002, 2010)​.
Transition research is concerned with the long-term changes that technological innovations
trigger in societal systems ​(Geels, 2002, 2010; Geels & Schot, 2007)​. In particular, it
highlights that a technology can only fulfill a certain function for society (e.g. energy supply
or transportation) once it is embedded into a wider ​socio-technical system​, which is
comprised of multiple actors – for example, firms, users, suppliers, policy makers,
universities and investors ​(Geels, 2005; Latour, 1996; Markard, Raven, & Truffer, 2012;
Smith, Voß, & Grin, 2010)​.
A socio-technical transition describes the shift from one socio-technical system to the
next, where a technological innovation moves from a protected niche to a dominant
socio-technical regime. A process which is shaped heavily by the exogenous context, or
landscape, of the technology ​(Geels, 2005; Geels & Schot, 2007)​. Commercial actors, or
firms in particular are a major driver during socio-technical transitions as both the producers
and adopters of new technologies ​(Loorbach & Wijsman, 2013)​. The shift from one
socio-technical system to the next is accompanied by technical, behavioral and economic
changes in production, distribution, and consumption, leading to new ways of living and
working ​(Geels, 2010; Markard et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2010)​.
Transition research has extensively examined transition processes on a systemic
level ​(Geels, McMeekin, & Pfluger, 2018; Geels, Sovacool, Schwanen, & Sorrell, 2017;
Genus & Coles, 2008; van Sluisveld et al., 2018)​. However, scholars in the field have
highlighted the need to also understand transition dynamics within individual actor groups in
more detail, in particular their actions and strategies ​(Bidmon & Knab, 2018; Bolton &
Hannon, 2016)​. Given the central role of firms during ​socio-technical transitions, t​ ransition
scholars have recently applied the paradigm of business models to analyze the
micro-dynamics of socio-technical transitions ​(Loorbach & Wijsman, 2013)​. These early
contributions, however, are still of a conceptual nature and call for a deeper empirical
understanding of the role of the business model during socio-technical transitions ​(Bidmon &
Knab, 2018; Bolton & Hannon, 2016; Sarasini & Linder, 2018)​. The business model is an
important unit of analysis to create a shared understanding of the way a firm does business
(Massa, Tucci, & Afuah, 2017; Teece, 2010)​. In other words, the business model articulates
the “​architecture of the firm’s value creation, delivery and capture mechanisms​” ​(Foss &
Saebi, 2018, p. 1)​ around a certain value proposition ​(Teece, 2010)​.

3
In the context of technological innovations, the business model is a useful tool to
uncover the technical potential and to realize economic value from that potential
(Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002)​. But it also acts as a mediator during socio-technical
transitions ​(Bidmon & Knab, 2018)​. Our study uses the nexus of applied AI technologies in
the energy and transportation sector to examine how business models act as mediators in
the beginning of a socio-technical transition. We examine a sample of 375 startup
companies that develop and use applied AI technologies. A hierarchical clustering approach
was used, based on a large-scale semantic analysis of the startups’ website texts, to answer
the following question: ​How do startups that apply AI technology articulate their business
model during a socio-technical transition?
By answering this question, we make three contributions. First, we add to the
emerging corpus of literature that examines the micro-dynamics of socio-technical
transitions. Second, we develop a novel research design, based on computational social
sciences that may provide interesting avenues for a more data-driven approach to the
structural analysis of socio-technical transitions, based on semantic analyses and clustering
methods. Last, we contribute to the business model literature strand that examines business
models in their ecosystem and exogenous context. In the next section, we first review
current literature at the intersection of transition and business model research. Section 3
presents our research design to analyze a sample of 375 applied AI startups in the
transportation and energy sector. Section 4 presents three distinct linguistic schemes that
resulted from our analysis. Section 5 discusses these findings in light of recent contributions
to transition research, finally, Section 6 develops concluding remarks for scholars and
managers.

2. Theoretical Background
2.1. Transition Research
Transition research examines large-scale shifts of socio-technical systems ​(Geels, 2010;
Markard et al., 2012)​. A socio-technical system is defined as the highly intertwined network
of actors that revolves around a technology to provide a function to society, for example,
supplying energy or transportation infrastructure ​(Smith et al., 2010)​. A ​socio-technical
transition is the complex process of shifting from one system to another, typically triggered
by a technological innovation. This shift entails a substantial change in the way societal
functions are fulfilled, produced, and consumed ​(Markard et al., 2012; Smith et al., 2010)​.
The ​Multi-Level-Perspective (MLP) has emerged as a framework to analyze and describe

4
these systemic changes ​(Geels, 2002; Genus & Coles, 2008)​. The framework uses three
levels to examine transitions: the socio-technical regime, the technological niche, and the
landscape.
The ​socio-technical regime refers to the highly institutionalized set of shared
cognitive, regulative, and normative rules and structures that currently enable societal
functions with the help of technology. The system is dynamic, yet stable within these rules so
that change and innovation only happen on an incremental level ​(Bidmon & Knab, 2018;
Geels, 2005; Smith et al., 2010)​. The ​technological niche is an important driver for change
as it provides a protected space for novel technologies that may, initially, not survive under
the current regime. With that, the niche is essential for radical innovation as it provides a
space for experimentation and learning to optimize the technology. Additionally, it allows for
the formation of new networks that support the technological innovation. Eventually,
technologies within the niche can mature and break through and into the dominant regime to
establish new rules and structures ​(Geels, 2002, 2005; Markard et al., 2012)​. The ​landscape
plays an essential role in this transition. It allows the novel technology to move from niche to
regime by providing the necessary exogenous conditions that cannot be influenced by the
actors directly (e.g. environmental change, social movements, or economic restructuring)
(Bolton & Hannon, 2016; Geels, 2005)​. Socio-technical transitions happen as dynamic and
iterative processes within and between these three layers ​(Geels & Schot, 2007)​.
The MLP provides a helpful framework to describe and analyze transitions on a
system level. The driving force behind these shifts, however, are strategic actions of
individual actors within the system. Hence, scholars have called for more actor-related
research to understand the micro-dynamics of socio-technical transitions ​(Geels, 2005;
Geels & Schot, 2007)​. Firms in particular play a pivotal role to develop, produce, and adopt
novel technologies, and thus provide a valuable unit of analysis when it comes to
socio-technical transitions ​(Loorbach & Wijsman, 2013)​. The ​business model concept has
only recently been introduced to this domain to understand the micro-dynamics of
socio-technical transitions. ​(Sarasini & Linder, 2018) focus on the sources of change and
inertia that result from business models in transition processes, while ​(Bolton & Hannon,
2016) analyze how business models influence dynamics and governance of sustainability
transitions. ​(Yun, Won, Park, Jeong, & Zhao, 2019) examine the role of business models in
market growth for different industries. On a more conceptual level, Bidmon and Knap (2018)
show three different roles that a business model can play during a transition: first, business
models can be part of the socio-technical regime, reinforcing its stability. Second, business
models may act as intermediaries between the technological niche and the socio-technical

5
regime facilitating the breakthrough of a novel technology. In this function, a business model
helps to articulate a shared vision about what a technology can do, it supports learning
processes to improve the technology and facilitates the emergence of new social networks
around the technology. Last, business models can be subject to innovation and emerge as
non-technical niche innovations, thus driving transitions without relying on technological
innovation. In line with previous authors’ findings, we focus our study on the business model
as a mediator between niche and regime, which helps to articulate a shared vision about
what the technology can do, and how it changes the way value is generated, distributed, and
consumed.

2.2. Business Model Research
The business model has emerged as an important unit of analysis in strategy, innovation
and technology management, entrepreneurship, and sustainability research ​(Foss & Saebi,
2017; Spieth, Schneckenberg, & Ricart, 2014)​. A key function of the business model is to
represent a linguistic scheme that describes how a firm does business ​(Massa et al., 2017)​.
In other words, “business models are, at heart, stories – stories that explain how enterprises
work” ​(Magretta, 2002, p. 1)​. Through these stories, a business model creates a shared
understanding about how the firm does business, both within and outside the firm ​(Massa et
al., 2017)​. A business model also articulates the “architecture of the firm’s value creation,
delivery and capture mechanisms” ​(Foss & Saebi, 2018, p. 1) around a certain value
proposition ​(Teece, 2010)​. In the context of technological innovations, the business model is
an important vehicle to uncover the technical potential and realize economic value from that
potential ​(Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002)​.
A unique ​value proposition t​ hat addresses market needs is key to uncover the full
potential of the technology ​(Björkdahl, 2009; Buganza, Dell’Era, Pellizzoni, Trabucchi, &
Verganti, 2015; Magistretti & Dell’Era, 2019; Trabucchi, Talenti, & Buganza, 2019)​. During
the process of defining a value proposition, firms can consider the dimensions of depth and
breadth. Depth refers to the variety of products or services developed (single or multiple),
while breadth describes how many use cases across industries the firm chooses to address
(Magistretti & Dell’Era, 2019)​. Choosing a narrow focus (e.g. single product in a single
industry) may allow firms to get a more detailed understanding of current problems and
needs that can be solved through the technology at hand ​(Arnold, Kiel, & Voigt, 2016;
Chesbrough, 2010; Metallo, Agrifoglio, Schiavone, & Mueller, 2018; Müller, Buliga, & Voigt,
2018)​. A broader scope (e.g. multiple products in multiple industries) helps to uncover the
latent potential of the technology, creating the possibility to identify underlying needs and

6
application areas that were previously unknown ​(König, Ungerer, Baltes, & Terzidis, 2019;
Magistretti & Dell’Era, 2019; Schmeiss & Friederici, 2019; Trabucchi et al., 2019)​.
Designing the architecture of the ​value creation, value delivery, and value capture
mechanisms ensures that the value proposition is fulfilled ​(Teece, 2010)​. Value creation
mechanisms refer to all activities that are required to develop and produce a product or
service – mainly the internal resources and capabilities of the firm as well as its network of
partners and suppliers. Value delivery mechanisms describe the way a product or service is
communicated

and

delivered

to

a

specific

customer

segment through different

communication and distribution channels. Value capture mechanisms describe the revenue
streams as well as the main cost drivers ​(Arnold et al., 2016; Bohnsack, Pinkse, & Kolk,
2014; Remane, Hanelt, Tesch, & Kolbe, 2017; Zott & Amit, 2010)​. A number of recent
publications have focused on how firms design business models to commercialize novel
technologies by taking into account the exogenous context in which these technologies
emerge ​(Bohnsack et al., 2014; König et al., 2019; Magistretti & Dell’Era, 2019; Yun et al.,
2019)​. While these studies are extending business model research beyond the firm-centric
level, they are still concerned with firm performance as the outcome. This study extends this
field of business model research and combines it with contemporary contributions in
transition research that view the business model as an intermediate concept during
socio-technical transitions ​(Bidmon & Knab, 2018; Yun et al., 2019)​. Taking applied AI
technologies in the energy and transportation sector as our research setting, we examine the
following question: ​How do startups that apply AI technology articulate their business model
during a socio-technical transition?

3. Material & Method
3.1. Empirical setting
The term ‘Artificial Intelligence’ dates back as far as the 1950s, when computer scientists
first proclaimed that machines could someday talk, solve problems, and perform creative
tasks – activities so far exclusively done by humans ​(Nilsson, 2009; Shoham et al., 2018)​.
Within the past five years, the number of AI applications in myriads of sectors has
accelerated almost exponentially. Startups played and continue to play an important role in
driving the development and adoption of these applications – the number of active AI
startups in the US increased by 113% between 2015 and 2018, while the total number of
startups only increased by 28% ​(Shoham et al., 2018)​. A central development that fueled
this trend is the improvement of machine learning technologies due to large amounts of

7
available data and increased computing power. Specifically, the development of neural
networks – systems that can be trained with large datasets and learn through feedback
loops – has spurred major advances. Today, we observe technologies that recognize, label,
and analyse various types of input data to automatically predict an outcome ​(Agrawal, Gans,
& Goldfarb, 2019; Brynjolfsson & Mcafee, 2017; Nilsson, 2009)​. We define these
technologies as ​applied AI ​technologies. Key technologies in this field are computer vision,
natural language processing, IoT technologies (e.g. sensors actuator systems), and robotics
(Stone et al., 2016)​. Computer Vision is the most common form of applied AI. It focuses on
the automatic recognition, labelling, and categorization of digital images and videos ​(Nilsson,
2009)​. Natural Language Processing enables machines to detect speech and interact
dynamically with humans, based on large conversational datasets ​(Nilsson, 2009)​. Internet
of Things (IoT) technologies aim to share, aggregate and process the large amounts of
sensory data from connected devices (e.g. appliances, vehicles, cameras) to derive
outcomes and actions ​(Stone et al., 2016)​. Robot technologies focus on training software for
robots to interact with their environment, for instance objects and humans, in both known
and unknown environments ​(Stone et al., 2016)​.
Applied AI technologies impact the way we live and work in different ways across
many sectors: transportation, energy, healthcare, education, and security are only a few
examples ​(Shoham et al., 2018; Stone et al., 2016)​. Our study focuses on the transportation
and energy sector, in line with previous research on socio-technical transitions ​(Bohnsack et
al., 2014; Geels et al., 2018; Li, Trutnevyte, & Strachan, 2015; Sarasini & Linder, 2018)​. In
both of these sectors, applied AI can drive change on three different levels: tasks, products,
and business processes as well as entire business models ​(Brynjolfsson & Mcafee, 2017)​.
On a task level, applied AI technologies can automate existing tasks, previously performed
by humans, to significantly reduce costs ​(Brynjolfsson & Mcafee, 2017; Brynjolfsson, Rock, &
Syverson, 2017)​. On a product and process level, applied AI supports the innovation
process with automated insights from large datasets that were previously not available
(Aghion, Jones, & Jones, 2017; Cockburn, Henderson, & Stern, 2018)​. Finally, on a
business model level, applied AI creates entirely new areas of business that challenge the
way value is currently created, delivered, and captured ​(Brynjolfsson et al., 2017; Schmeiss
& Friederici, 2019)​.

3.2. Data collection
We collected our sample using the proprietary database of a Berlin-based big data analytics
firm1. The database includes over 40,000 technology-driven firms globally and is
continuously updated using various data sources, such as company websites, venture
capital and accelerator portfolios, open databases, trade fairs, and research projects. The
data-base thus provides a comprehensive list of technology-driven firms globally. Our search
only included startups, defined as companies founded within the last ten years (after 2008).
We used an extensive set of keyword combinations (see Appendix 1) to comprise an initial
list of AI startups in the transportation and energy sector, including 749 firms for
transportation and 2,375 firms for energy. The list included company names, websites,
founding years, short description texts as well as the full HTML website codes.
We then conducted a rigorous data cleaning process to ensure that the firms were
relevant for our analysis. First, we removed any duplicates and firms with too little available
information from the individual lists, resulting in 439 firms for transportation and 1,370 firms
for energy. Second, two researchers coded the firms independently to decide on the
relevance for this study. For that, we excluded any firms that did not focus immediately on
applied AI in the context of transportation or energy. Additionally, we excluded investment
funds, agencies and consultancies, e-commerce sites, and news outlets as these firms do
not actively create applied AI technologies. We compared our decisions and discussed
cases in question to decide whether or not the firm should be included. This data cleaning
process lead to a list of 228 firms for transportation and 259 firms for energy. Last, we
excluded all firms from the sample where the full HTML text was not available. The final list
includes 180 firms for transportation and 195 firms for energy, leading to a total sample of
375 firms. The number of AI startups globally included ​3,465 firms in 2018 (​Statista, 2018​),

our sample thus represents 11% of all global AI startups.
We used the full HTML text of each startup’s website as the basis of our analysis,
resulting in 1,237 pages of raw text2. ​This dataset provides a unique possibility to
understand how startups articulate their business model architecture and thus create a
shared understanding of it both within and outside the firm. ​With regard to their technology
background, firms in both sectors are evenly distributed. Naturally, in transportation with

applications such as autonomous driving, computer vision technologies are more prevalent
(see Figure 1).

Figure 1:​ Technology distribution by sector.

3.3. Data analysis
Our study aims to understand how startups articulate their business model architecture
during a socio-technical transition. To answer this question, we follow a multi-method
research approach, combining topic modelling and subsequent hierarchical clustering based
on the large-scale analysis of publicly available texts. Based on the full HTML texts of all 375
firms in our sample, we first identified the type of value proposition of each firm. Secondly,
we assessed the architecture of their value creation, delivery, and capture mechanisms (see
Table 1).

Table 1:​ Operationalization of the business model dimensions.
To classify the ​value proposition,​ we defined the depth (number of products) and
breadth (number of use cases / industries) for each firm. For this, the first author reviewed all
375 websites and classified each firm into binary codes for both depth and breadth. The
website structure provided valuable guidance for the coding process as most websites with
multiple products or industries indicate so in the menu bar on the website.
To classify the underlying ​value architecture for each firm, we focus on the
dimensions of value creation, delivery, and capture ​(Bohnsack et al., 2014; Massa et al.,
2017; Remane et al., 2017; Teece, 2010)​. To identify how these dimensions are configured
for each firm, we first identified the 200 most common non-trivial keywords across all website
texts in the sample. The first author then categorized these keywords into the dimensions of
value creation, delivery, and capture. During the process, we eliminated five keywords as
being too trivial (see Appendix 2). We then performed a statistical analysis to identify the
frequency of each keyword in relation to the total length of the HTML text. With the 375
company texts and 195 non-trivial keywords (which are trimmed to their shortest non-trivial
stem), we built a document-term matrix in which the absolute count of occurrences of each
keyword in every document is listed. Based on this absolute frequency count, we calculated
the average frequency of each keyword, weighted by the sum of frequencies of all keywords
in each value architecture group. As an illustration, the keyword “service” belongs to the

11
keyword group of “value delivery”. It is trimmed to “servic”. Company A has mentioned
“servic” 15 times in their webpage text. However, the other 62 “value delivery” keywords
have in sum been mentioned 300 times in the same website text. Hence, “service” would
receive a weighted frequency of 0.05 for the Company A document. We then identified the
mean frequency for each dimension across all keywords for value creation, delivery, and
capture for every company. In this way, the resulting three measures for each dimension are
neither biased by the size of the original company document nor by the length of the value
dimension keywords.
To finally identify different representations of business model architectures in the
sample, we ran a hierarchical agglomerative clustering with a ward-D clustering algorithm
based on Euclidean distances between the three mean frequencies of all three value
dimensions and the two binary classifications for multiple/single product and industry. This
clustering resulted in three distinct clusters of firms with different value propositions and
value architectures. We consulted ‘Elbow’ and ‘Average Silhouette’ methods to determine
the optimal number to be three clusters. To control for the fact that the development stage of
a startup may influence the value architecture, we compared the company age across all
clusters without finding any significant differences (see Appendix 3). Additionally, we did not
find a significant difference in value architectures across the two sectors, energy and
transportation (see Appendix 4). The following section presents our detailed results.

4. Results
The hierarchical clustering revealed three distinct clusters with different value propositions
and underlying value architectures. Looking at the value propositions, we see a clear
distinction in the dimensions of technology depth and breadth (see Table 2). Cluster 1 mainly
consists of firms that offer a broad scope of products, typically in multiple industries. Cluster
2 is characterized by firms that focus strongly on product development, either with a single
product or a range of products. Cluster 3 is comprised of a rather small group of firms – that
split from cluster 1 – and also focuses on a broad range of products. While cluster 1 and 3
appear similar based on the value propositions, a closer look at the underlying value
architecture brings out some significant differences.

and few value creation activities – hence the split from cluster 1. Table 3 summarizes the
value propositions as well as a simplified value architecture for each cluster.

5. Discussion
The sample represents 375 startups that develop applied AI in the energy and transportation
sector. In the context of socio-technical transitions, these startups are an important driver.
Not only for the development and production, but also for the commercialization and
adoption of applied AI ​(Bidmon & Knab, 2018; Loorbach & Wijsman, 2013)​. Through the
large-scale adoption of applied AI technologies, new rules and structures can emerge of how
societal functions, like energy and transportation, are fulfilled ​(Geels, 2002, 2005; Markard et
al., 2012)​. The micro-dynamics of how startups shape socio-technical transitions happens on
two levels: first, startups use business models to articulate a shared vision of what the
technology can do ​(Bidmon & Knab, 2018)​. Second, through this shared vision, business
models become an intermediary in the transition of applied AI technologies from the
technological niche to the dominant regime ​(Bidmon & Knab, 2018; Bolton & Hannon, 2016;
Loorbach & Wijsman, 2013; Sarasini & Linder, 2018)​. In that, they represent linguistic
schemes that describe the architecture of value creation, delivery, and capture mechanisms
to a certain value proposition ​(Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002; Magretta, 2002; Massa et

14
al., 2017)​. Our findings reveal that applied AI startups use distinct linguistic schemes to
communicate what the technology can do.
The ​first scheme (represented by cluster 1) articulates the value proposition to
automate tasks at scale, expressed through a broad product portfolio across multiple use
cases ​(Agrawal et al., 2019; Brynjolfsson & Mcafee, 2017)​. This helps to expand the
technology at scale and supports the discovery of new application areas. We find that the
underlying business model architecture balanced between value creation, delivery, and
capture mechanisms, thus enabling the startups in that group to successfully commercialize
the technology ​(Björkdahl, 2009; Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002; Gambardella &
McGahan, 2010)​. A representative example of cluster 1 is The Floow, a UK-based startup,
founded in 2012, with the mission to make mobility safer and smarter for all. The company
raised a Series A investment of $16.6M in 2017 and currently has 110+ employees. Their
value proposition is to bring innovation to the world of mobility. The company creates value
through intelligent telematics solutions that combine advanced IoT technology with data
science and behavioral methods from social science. They offer an entire product portfolio,
ranging from a white label SaaS platform to educational programs for drivers, and consulting
services. The Floow delivers value to customers in the insurance, automotive, logistics and
public sector, using proven mechanisms such as B2B sales strategies, world-class support,
and close collaborations with industry players. The company employs established value
capture mechanisms such as license models for their white label SaaS solutions,
subscription models for the educational and scoring services, and individual consulting
deals.
The ​second scheme (represented by cluster 2) highlights a value proposition to
identify new, innovative ways of automating tasks ​(Aghion et al., 2017; Cockburn et al.,
2018)​. We find that a strong product focus allows the startups to explore the technology
in-depth, develop it further and uncover innovative products and processes that reveal its full
potential ​(Buganza et al., 2015; Dell’Era et al., 2017; Magistretti & Dell’Era, 2019)​. The
business model architecture in this scheme relies heavily on value creation mechanisms,
highlighting the strong product development focus ​(Arnold et al., 2016; Bohnsack et al.,
2014; Remane et al., 2017)​. Startups in this cluster do not emphasize value delivery
mechanisms, thus they often build partnerships to actually commercialize the technology
and capture value from it. For example, Shifted Energy is a startup from cluster 2. The
company was founded in 2013 in Honolulu, Hawaii to transform the way renewable energy is
collected, stored, and managed. The company currently has ten employees. The startup’s
value proposition is to convert commercial electric water heaters into efficient and flexible

15
demand-response-assets to store renewable energy during the day. This helps to stabilize
electricity grids – especially in remote communities – and accelerates the integration of wind
and solar power. The company creates and captures value through a software and hardware
solution that allows renters to retrofit existing water heaters and monitor their energy
consumption via efficiency algorithms and controls built into the system. To deliver value,
Shifted Energy partners with Particle, an IoT platform that provides a user friendly frontend,
as well as Hawaiian Electric and Hawaiian Energy to install the grid-interactive water
heaters.
The ​third scheme (represented by cluster 3) also employs a broad product focus.
Different from the startups in Cluster 1, startups in this cluster do not rely on a balanced
business model to commercialize the technology. They put less emphasis on value creation
activities but instead create innovative ways of delivering the product that allow the user to
interact with the technology in a new way ​(Brynjolfsson et al., 2017; Buganza et al., 2015;
Trabucchi et al., 2019)​. By creating innovative user experiences, they are able to raise
awareness for the technology and capture value from it. An example from cluster 3 is
drive.ai, a Silicon Valley-based company founded in 2015 with a mission to improve the state
of mobility. The company raised multiple venture capital rounds and was acquired by Apple
in 2019. It’s value proposition focuses on mobility solutions that put people and safety first,
while solving the unique needs of communities. Drive.ai creates value by developing fully
autonomous systems for cars. The firm focuses on delivery mechanisms for their technology:
embedded into the system are communicative elements that allow the car to communicate
and engage with the passengers and pedestrians, creating trust in the system. Additionally,
they offer educational programs for local communities on how to introduce and manage
autonomous vehicles in their transportation system. Regarding the ways a business model
can act as an intermediary during transitions, we derive novel insights from the three
business model schemes described above. First, a business model facilitates the ​expansion
of the technology in scale and scope (scheme 1). By automating tasks across industries and
creating a balanced value architecture, these business models become sustainable and
allow for productivity gains ​(Aghion et al., 2017; Agrawal et al., 2019; Brynjolfsson et al.,
2017) and increased innovative outputs ​(Cockburn et al., 2018)​. Applied AI business models
may thus break through to the dominant regime and challenge or even replace existing
business models ​(Geels, 2002; Sarasini & Linder, 2018; Yun et al., 2019)​.
Second, a business model deepens the ​exploration of the technology​, resulting in
new products and processes (scheme 2). The underlying value architecture focuses on
value creation mechanisms, allowing startups to uncover the full potential of the technology.

16
However, commercializing that technology and realizing economic gains becomes
challenging ​(Chesbrough & Rosenbloom, 2002)​. This implies that startups will be dependent
on cooperation with other actors to realize economic value from their technology
(Gambardella & McGahan, 2010)​. In line with ​(Bidmon & Knab, 2018) we find that business
models facilitate the development of new networks around a technology. Building on these
findings, we show that these networks are not only essential on a system level to move from
niche to regime, but also on an actor level to allow individual actors (like technology-focused
startups) to create economic value.
Last, a business model triggers new ways of ​interaction with the technology ​through
innovative customer and usage experiences (scheme 3). The value architecture is focused
on best in class value delivery mechanisms, putting less emphasis on the technology itself
but rather on the way the customer experiences and uses it ​(Trabucchi et al., 2019)​. This
scheme is particularly relevant in the process of establishing new cognitive and behavioral
rules and structures around how a certain societal function is changed ​(Bidmon & Knab,
2018; Geels, 2005)​, because it changes the way actors experience and interact with
technology in the context of a societal function. Table 4 summarizes our discussion on how
startups articulate business models during socio-technical transitions and the resulting
intermediary functions.

6. Conclusions
This study examines how 375 AI startups in the energy and transportation sector articulate
their business models during socio-technical transitions. Using a large-scale statistical
analysis of the full website text for each startup, we derive three distinct business model
schemes that result in different intermediary functions of the business model during
socio-technical transitions.
From a theoretical perspective, our study makes three contributions. First, we
contribute to the emerging field of the micro-dynamic actor-level view on socio-technical
transitions ​(Bidmon & Knab, 2018; Geels, 2005; Loorbach & Wijsman, 2013)​. We show that
the business model is indeed a valuable unit of analysis to understand the impact of firms
during socio-technical transitions. Future research could build on our findings to examine the
micro-dynamics between different actors. Their interactions may form new social networks
around novel technology. In particular, the actions of incumbents may have a very different
impact on the transition process than actions by startup companies. Regulators may have to
look into distributing their resources in a more granular and selective way. They could, for
example, specifically support startups to drive and expedite technological transition
processes. Furthermore, researchers could complement our findings on startup business
models by examining other types of data (for example non-public company data) to
understand how learning takes place in the process of developing a business model scheme
around the technology. Second, we contribute to the wider academic discussion on
socio-technical transitions by employing a novel data-driven research method, based on
computational science ​(Geels et al., 2018)​. Future research could build on this research
design and employ a more data-driven approach to analyze socio-technical transitions on a
systemic level. The large-scale analysis of text documents on each level of the MLP would
allow researchers to complement the so far rather conceptual descriptions and depictions of
transition pathways with insights from empirical data ​(Geels, 2002, 2005; Geels & Schot,
2007)​. In general, the method of hierarchical clustering based on weighted document-term
matrices with relevant architecture keywords is an agile statistical approach that can be
implemented in similar scenarios, provided a reliable document corpus exists. Last but not
least, we contribute to the business model literature that examines business models in their
exogenous and environmental context ​(Bohnsack et al., 2014; König et al., 2019; Magistretti
& Dell’Era, 2019; Yun et al., 2019)​. Future research may examine larger datasets of firms,
also from other sectors, to understand if there are archetypical business model schemes that
drive change in their environment. More in line with existing business model literature,

18
researchers may further investigate the relation to individual firm performance for these
different schemes.
From a managerial perspective we offer important insights for entrepreneurs who
design business models around applied AI technologies. The business model schemes we
identified may yield interesting insights when it comes to the strategic orientation and
commercialization strategy of the firm.
