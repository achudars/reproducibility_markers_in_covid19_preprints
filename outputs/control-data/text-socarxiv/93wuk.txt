Abstract
This article builds on the concept of disciplinary and professional stewardship, to discuss the
ethical practice guidelines from two professional associations and a method that you can learn to
use in order to implement those guidelines throughout a professional career. The steward is an
individual who practices in a field in a manner that invites and warrants the trust of the public,
other practitioners, and employers to uphold and maintain the integrity of that field. It is
important to your sense of professional identity - and also your profession - to cultivate a sense
of stewardship; and one of the foundational aspects of stewardly behavior is to understand
professional practice guidelines and the types of behaviors that are expected by practitioners in a
given field. Therefore, this article presents two sets of guidelines that can support
professionalism, ethical practice, and the development of a coherent professional identity for the
statistician and data scientist. The American Statistical Association (ASA) and the Association of
Computing Machinery (ACM) are large professional organizations with international
membership. An overall objective of each of these organizations is to promote excellence in and
by their members and all those who practice in their respective – sometimes shared/joint –
domains. It can be helpful to consider the field of ‘statistics and data science’ to be a hybrid of,
or co-dependent on, these two fields, which is one reason why the two organizations are
presented together. Another reason is that both organizations take ethical practice very seriously,
and both engaged in lengthy projects to carefully revise their respective ethical guidelines for
professional practice in 2018. Not only does engagement with the guidelines support you
initiating, and beginning to demonstrate, your commitment to this particular professional
identity, but also exploring the ethical guidelines for professional practice (through ASA or
ACM) is a first step towards documenting your commitment to stewardly work as a data
scientist. Ethical reasoning, the third focus of this article, helps deepen the understanding of the
guidelines and can be useful to generate evidence of stewardly development.

1. Introduction
Most professional preparation – including undergraduate coursework, internships, and other
experiences – is focused on learning all of the “tools of the trade”. These “tools” include
methods, techniques, and how to apply these correctly and in the appropriate circumstances.
Elsewhere (Tractenberg, 2019-a) I have asserted that “correct application” of these “tools”
involves considerations beyond just whether a given tool of the trade will work to solve a
specific problem – i.e., whether the application of some data science-specific knowledge is all
that any given problem requires. A steward is defined as someone to whom “we can entrust the
vigor, quality, and integrity of the field” (Golde & Walker 2006: p. 5). We have identified a core
set of knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) that, together, constitute stewardly behaviors (Rios
et al. 2019). Stewardly practice – or the application of that discipline-specific knowledge in an
ethical, professional, way - requires an understanding of professional standards (KSA 1,
“requisite knowledge”; see Rios et al. 2019 and Tractenberg 2019-a). However, it is not very
reassuring to entrust a field to someone who has simply memorized a list of professional practice
standards or descriptions; greater trust is warranted for the steward who can demonstrate their
ability to use the practice standards appropriately. For this reason (among others!), a
developmental trajectory was published that discusses all of the stewardship KSAs together with
how they can be demonstrated and improved upon over time, in a coherent whole called a
Mastery Rubric (the Mastery Rubric for Stewardship, Rios et al. 2019; see Section 5 of this
article and Tractenberg 2017 for greater detail about the Mastery Rubric construct). With the
understanding that stewardship requires a set of KSAs, all being performed at a high level of
sophistication by the independent practitioner (“journeyman”), reviewing the first stewardship
KSA (of eight – see Section 2 and Tables 2 and 3) helps orient us to why “learning the ethical
guidelines” is not sufficient to earn the distinction of “steward”.

Table 1 describes how stewardship KSA 1, “Requisite knowledge/situational awareness”, can
develop over time as an individual becomes increasingly worthy of the designation of “steward”.

Notice that the differences between the novice and apprentice on this KSA do not hinge on the
apprentice’s memorization of the professional practice standards, but rather, on understanding
that there are two dimensions, the legal/illegal one and the one that is a much more nuanced
continuum, running from ethical to unethical. The apprentice steward is identified by their
engagement in learning about these dimensions and how to both recognize them and respond to
them in practice. Part of the recognition of illegal or unethical behaviors comes from an
awareness that our professional decisions can lead to both harmful and beneficial effects or
impacts. Clearly, most decisions that lead to illegal acts are unethical – although breaking traffic
laws, committing illegal acts, in order to get an injured person to a hospital is a concrete example
of illegal yet ethical decisions. While the relevant laws are usually clear (which does not prevent
illegal behaviors!), we are focused on the more difficult circumstances surrounding – and
complicating – decisions that are on the ethical to unethical continuum. In some cases, the harms
that accrue following decisions that are contrary to ethical practice standards are obvious, but the
exact point where behavior deviated from what the ethical practitioner should do/have done is
less (or not) clear. Even if something is legal, it does not prevent harms from accruing to some as
a result of our actions and decisions. In those cases, the harms must be mitigated or undone, if
possible. In other cases, however, decisions have not yet been made – making it harder to figure
out which guideline principles or ethics code elements should be followed. For more on harms
and a method for determining harms and benefits, see Tractenberg (2019-b).
This article first explores the substance of the professional practice guidelines from the American
Statistical Association (ASA) and Association of Computing Machinery (ACM). They may
seem, on their faces, to be simple lists of desired/desirable behaviors. An inclination might be to
just memorize them (and/or keep the lists handy “in case of emergency”). While these should
definitely be bookmarked, the intention here is not to encourage that inclination! Instead,
exploring the guidelines through the perspective of the evolving steward, and with the ethical
reasoning framework that this article will introduce, will provide some evidence that ethical
guidelines are essentially useless if simply memorized. These guidelines were not developed to be
memorized - they are not lists of rules. The ASA and ACM are large professional organizations
with international membership. An overall objective of each of these organizations is to promote
excellence in and by their members and all those who practice in their respective – sometimes
shared/joint – domains. It can be helpful to consider the field of statistics and data science to be a
hybrid of these two fields, which is one reason why the two organizations are presented together.
Another reason is that both organizations take ethical practice very seriously, and both engaged
in lengthy projects to carefully revise their respective ethical guidelines for professional practice
in 2018.
Guidelines describe the “best” professional practices that are agreed on by the practicing
community. The ASA and ACM have articulated, and continue to refine and maintain, their
respective statements of what constitutes ethical professional practice in their domains. The ASA
Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice (GLs) and ACM Code of Ethics (CE) also specifically
note that even those who do not self-identify as statisticians, or who are not members of the
ASA, are obliged to follow these GLs whenever they work with data. Nearly every scientist (and
many who are not scientists!) use statistics and increasingly, other aspects of data science, in
their day to day work: biomedical research, policy, and business use statistical methodologies
implicitly or explicitly to support decisions. While specific training and background is required

for specialists who develop or design computational machinery (algorithms, software, hardware,
etc.), the ACM CE are also described as applying to all uses/users of computation. Both of these
organizations want all applications of their disciplinary knowledge to be done ethically – and
since many non-members use these methods, the GLs and CE are both described as pertaining to
all who use or implement methods/technology from their domains.
Rather than serving as lists of behaviors to memorize, the ASA and ACM professional practice
guidance documents are intended to be useful references over time; as experience and
responsibilities change over time, individuals should also experience different levels of
interaction with/relevance of the GL principles. Similarly, both the ASA and ACM documents
entail performance descriptions relating to critical and fundamental aspects of most or all of our
activities as practitioners, and are not limited to specific projects. Over time in a career, a wide
variety of circumstances will occur and simply having memorized the GLs is not going to suffice
for determining, and justifying, which GLs or GL/CE principles/elements are most applicable
and lead to the most stewardly result for any given situation. That is why an increasingly
sophisticated understanding of the professional practice standards is only one KSA in the
repertoire of the steward.
As discussed elsewhere (Tractenberg 2019-a; see also Rios et al 2019), the novice performer of
any given stewardship KSA is not only/always someone early in their training, but can also be
someone further along in a career but new to the construct of stewardship. The apprentice is that
individual who is actively engaged in developing the required foundation for stewardly practice
in the domain (e.g., learning how to ethically utilize the tools of the trade), and the journeyman is
that individual who is a recognized independent – ethical - practitioner in that field, domain, or
trade. As we consider the first KSA of stewardship, we can see that the independent practitioner
(journeyman steward) is the one who consistently exercises the professional standards:
consistency of performance means following the practice standards before harms accrue, as well
as identifying whenever they have not been followed so that harms can be identified and
mitigated. Journeyman performance of this KSA requires far more than memorization and/or
keeping the guidelines handy.
With 52 (ASA) or even 28 (ACM) elements, the GLs/CE contain a LOT to remember – but the
point is that memorizing the CE/GLs and their content is not sufficient for stewardly professional
practice. Recognizing when, and that, the practice standards from either or both professional
perspectives may be needed (identifying that an ethical problem or challenge exists) and
determining what alternatives exist are two very difficult – and essential – steps in utilizing these
documents as they were intended to be used. This recognition is the crux of stewardship KSA #1:
Requisite knowledge and situational awareness.
2. Stewardship and professional practice guidelines
Guidelines are established for “good” or ethical professional practice. Just as there is more to
“learning statistics” than applying “the right” formulae or running software, there is also more to
“being a stewardly or ethical statistician/data scientist” than learning the GLs/CE for either – or
even both – of these professional associations. There are multiple methods for accomplishing
many statistics and data science tasks, and the “best” method may depend on what resources are

available and the priorities that the data themselves cause/create (e.g., hard to collect; hard to
verify; prone to measurement error; confounded with other variables in the data set, etc.).
Similarly, there are often multiple ways to identify ethical problems or questions that can arise in
practice, before or after they have arisen. There are definitely multiple ways to address ethical
problems, including “ignore it”. Factual knowledge (i.e., memorizing the GLs/CE) is unlikely to
help you develop the ability to formulate, and then choose from, multiple possible responses to a
breach of ethics - particularly if all of the options are justifiable. Once you are familiar with the
contents of the GLs/CE, including their specific elements, their use in your everyday decisionmaking will typically involve some prioritization of competing obligations or solutions. It is this
second step – making decisions that lead to actions that are consistent with the GLs/CE – that
characterizes the journeyman steward.
Unlike laws, guidelines are not rules. Thus, determining which practice principles apply – and
which ones take precedence when two or more are applicable – and in which situations, is an
important and complex type of reasoning. What is illegal is a lot clearer than what is “unethical”
in the workplace - also, a shorter list, so it makes sense to tell people what not to do. However, a
focus on these (what not to do – or, how to avoid getting caught doing what you shouldn’t) will
not promote the integrity of the field. The eight different aspects of knowledge, skill, and ability
(KSAs) that comprise stewardship are discussed in depth elsewhere (Rios et al. 2019;
Tractenberg, 2019-a) and are listed at the end of this Section. As noted, the first KSA requires
both a familiarity with, and an understanding of, professional practice guidelines. However, it is
also true that “data science” is as a career or field is in a very early stage of development, and as
of March 2019, there are no professional practice standards for “data science” that can be used to
learn to reason ethically. In the United Kingdom, the government agencies concerned with data
ethics have worked towards a framework within which government practices can be aligned to
promote ethical use and collection of data (
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachme
nt_data/file/524298/Data_science_ethics_framework_v1.0_for_publication__1_.pdf ), giving
an example of guidance about how to practice data science in an ethical way. Another example
is the “Data Science Ethics Checklist”, http://deon.drivendata.org/ (DSEC), which provides a
list of things to consider – again, as a project goes on/in the practice of data science. Neither of
these is a method for formalizing – for the learner/future practitioner – what it means to be an
ethical or stewardly professional. While these lists can be useful in documenting the features of a
project and whether ethical features were considered at each stage, these do not refer to
professional practice standards, so cannot help orient you towards stewardly professional
practice.
Tractenberg et al. (2015) pointed out that the development of professional guidelines is one way
for a profession to clarify the qualifications to practice, and to solidify the formation of coherent
professional identities across practitioners. Neither the UK nor the DSEC examples are interested
in the professional identity of the practitioner; the GLs and EC clearly are. It is also important to
recognize that many discussions of “ethical data science” end up focusing solely on protecting
privacy and confidentiality of data, and security. However, there is a lot more to “professional
practice with data” for the data scientist than data security and privacy. The DSEC includes items
relating to data storage (and security and longevity) and both analysis and modeling of the data
that are collected. The entire DSEC is 20 items – privacy and security of the data are only two of

these 20 items. Similarly, the ASA (52 items in total) and ACM (28 items in total) include only a
few items relating to privacy and confidentiality – not because these are not important aspects of
stewardly practice, but because there is a great deal more to professionalism than just privacy
and confidentiality considerations. Moreover, harms do not accrue solely due to breaches in
privacy and confidentiality. And, harms to the profession accrue whenever our actions and
decisions decrement, rather than bolstering, the integrity of the field. Furthermore, unlike
checklists both the ASA and ACM guidance recognize that in some situations, more than one of
their constituent elements may come into play. While the ACM encourages prioritizing “the
public good” to resolve conflicting ACM principles, the ASA stipulates that, whenever principles
conflict, priority of considerations must be done “according to context”.
There is no set of practice guidelines specifically for data science, and there is no real rationale
for a separate set that does not include ASA and ACM perspectives. We therefore turn to the
guidelines of these organizations for the initiation of your development of stewardly behaviors.
This article is entitled “strengthening your practice and your profession” because it seeks to not
only promote ethical practice, but also to enable you to use your growing understanding of, and
commitment to, ethical practice of data science to strengthen the profession as the steward you
seek to become. As you saw in Table 1, the journeyman steward recognizes when to use the
GL/CE and does so. This recognition plus action demonstrates for all observers that the steward
is a person to whom the field can be entrusted. By accepting this responsibility, the steward not
only practices ethically, s/he also helps to create both work conditions and a culture that support
stewardship and ethical practice – this is one way that the steward strengthens their profession.
Tables 2 and 3, presented in the next two sections, each show a matrix of alignment between the
Principles of the ACM CE (Table 2, Section 3) and ASA GLs (Table 3, Section 4) relating to the
practitioner. In each of these tables, the rows represent the features of the respective
organizations’ CE/GLs, while the columns capture the KSAs of the steward.
As you can see from the guidance documents themselves, or their representations in Sections 3
and 4 and Tables 2 and 3, the ASA GLs and ACM CE are complex. The 2018 revisions of the
ACM CE took over a year to do, with multiple versions being circulated throughout the ACM
membership for comment and revisions before the final was approved in February 2018. The
2018 ASA GL revisions by the Committee on Professional Ethics of the ASA (Chaired by this
article’s author from 2016-2019) followed a major revision effort 2014-2016. The 2016 GLs
were revised in 2018 to specifically note that bullying, sexual harassment/assault, and
intimidation are not ethical - but also, that any “ethical statistician” who observes these should do
what they can to stop them (again, promoting an ethical workplace and strengthening the
profession by ensuring that the statistical practitioner can work in an ethical context). This raises
an important point about the utility and complexity of the ASA and ACM guidelines: they are
not static. As reflections of the ideals for ethical practice, such guidelines require ongoing
attention – just as was described for the individual’s development and documentation of the
stewardly mindset. The steward who “exercises professional practice standards” does so by
understanding their dynamic nature, as well as how they interrelate – not by simply memorizing
what they contain.

The KSAs of stewardship (S) are more fully discussed elsewhere (Tractenberg, 2019-a; Rios et
al. 2019), so they are abbreviated in Tables 2 (ACM GL alignment) and 3 (ASA GL alignment)
for simplicity’s sake, as follows:
Requisite knowledge /situational awareness: S1
Create and/or generate new methods/new knowledge: S2
Critically evaluate extant knowledge: S3
Conserve ideas (or not, if deemed rejectable & non-conservation is justified): S4
Responsibly write: S5
Responsibly teach/mentor/model: S6
Responsibly apply disciplinary knowledge: S7
Responsibly communicate: S8
The reader is strongly encouraged to become familiar with these KSAs of stewardship (e.g., Rios
et al. 2019; Tractenberg 2019-a) to make Tables 2 and 3 more comprehensible. The Code of
Ethics (CE) and Guidelines (GLs) are summarized in the following text and should be accessed
and bookmarked, so that both Tables 2 and 3 and the discussion of those Tables, are more
meaningful.
3. ACM CE
The ACM Code of Ethics can be found here: https://ethics.acm.org/
and was initially published in 1992. The Code was updated in 2018. The code is motivated by
the fact that “Computing professionals’ actions change the world”: “To act responsibly, they
should reflect upon the wider impacts of their work, consistently supporting the public good. The
ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct ("the Code") expresses the conscience of the
profession.” (ACM 2018, emphasis added). The ACM Code is not intended just for ACM
members: they specify that “(t)he Code is designed to inspire and guide the ethical conduct of all
computing professionals, including current and aspiring practitioners, instructors, students,
influencers, and anyone who uses computing technology in an impactful way.” Finally, the Code
“serves as a basis for ethical decision-making”. In the final section of this article, a method for
ethical decision making will be discussed.
Table 2 shows the alignment of ACM principles with KSAs of Stewardship. We know that
stewardship KSA #1 involves understanding and exemplifying professional practice standards,
but it can be helpful to explore how the ACM CE principles (and the ASA GLs in Table 3) are
essentially in agreement with stewardship. The ACM Code is organized into four main areas:
General Moral Principles; Professional Responsibilities; Professional Leadership Principles; and
Compliance with the code. These four areas contain 2-9 specific elements yielding 28 principles,
all listed in the rows of Table 2 together with their degree of alignment (the # of KSAs that
“match” the ACM elements on some level) with the stewardship KSAs that appear in the
columns. For simplicity, Table 2 shows only the heading of each CE element; the full Code
contains explanatory narrative of each of these elements.

(‡) The Guidelines and the stewardship KSAs are quite different; the language used in each case
is also quite different. These ‡s indicate that, given the correct context, that KSA would be
aligned with that Guideline Principle, but superficially the alignment is not apparent.
As you can see in Table 2, there is a great deal of alignment between the GL principles and the
KSAs of stewardship. But, as noted in the table, in some cases the ACM GL principles are
explicitly worded for a computational context that makes it difficult to identify alignment
exactly; the ‡ symbol is used to identify these difficulties. As an example, take ACM GL
principle 4.2: “Treat violations of the Code as inconsistent with membership in the ACM.” Since
the ACM is an organization with members but stewardship is a construct (and not an
organization), it isn’t possible to match 4.2 with any of the KSAs of stewardship exactly.
However, the spirit of KSA S7, “Responsibly teach/mentor/model”, suggests that if you are
teaching, training, or mentoring people to be stewardly, you would logically treat violations of
your stewardship training as inconsistent with the label “steward”. These conceptual similarities
are indicated in the ACM alignment table with the ‡ symbol. By contrast, consider CE 2.2
(“Maintain high standards of professional competence, conduct, and ethical practice”), which is a
clearer and more literal match to the stewardship KSAs S1 and S5-S8 (indicated with the asterisk
*).
This Table reinforces the claim that just memorizing the list of items on the ACM CE would not
be sufficient even for a simple alignment exercise: without thoughtful consideration of the CE
elements and stewardship KSAs, you would only be able to literally match words. Part of a
deeper understanding of the practice guidelines (and of stewardship) entails moving from the
superficial/literal to the more abstract intent of the CE and what it means, and looks like, to be
stewardly as a data scientist. It is worthwhile for you to consider the alignment represented in
Table 2: focus first on identifying the cells where it is most clear to you how the CE elements
and stewardship KSAs “match”, and make sure you understand the alignment at that level. Then
move on to the cells where alignment seems more abstract; understanding how all features of
professional practice represent, or are consistent with, stewardship can help you to demonstrate
apprentice level performance, and then move on to the journeyman level of stewardship KSA #1.

4. ASA GLs
The ASA Ethical Guidelines for Statistical Practice (“ASA GLs”) began to take shape in the
1970s and were first published by the ASA in 1995. As reiterated in 2016 and 2018, the ASA
GLs are “intended to help statistics practitioners make and communicate decisions ethically”.
Like the ACM CE, decisions that the practitioner makes are highlighted as the points around
which consideration and ethical practice are focused. The ASA GLs also specify that they exist
“(t)o inform those relying on statistical analysis, including employers, colleagues and the public,
of the standards that they should expect.” Just like the ACM CE, the ASA GLs are also relevant
beyond those who are members of the ASA or who self identify as “statisticians and data
scientists” – specifying that the GLs “…should guide both those whose primary occupation is
statistics and those in all other disciplines who use statistical methods in their professional
work.” (emphasis added). The ASA GLs promote observable professional behavior among
practitioners, and trust in their work by employers/colleagues/collaborators.
The eight general principles for ethical statistical practice (http://www.amstat.org/ASA/YourCareer/Ethical-Guidelines-for-Statistical-Practice.aspx) are shown below; the full 52 items
appear at that URL:
A. Professional Integrity and Accountability
The ethical statistician uses methodology and data that are relevant and appropriate,
without favoritism or prejudice, and in a manner intended to produce valid, interpretable, and
reproducible results. The ethical statistician does not knowingly accept work for which he/she is
not sufficiently qualified, is honest with the client about any limitation of expertise, and consults
other statisticians when necessary or in doubt. It is essential that statisticians treat others with
respect.
B. Integrity of data and methods
The ethical statistician is candid about any known or suspected limitations, defects, or
biases in the data that may impact the integrity or reliability of the statistical analysis. Objective
and valid interpretation of the results requires that the underlying analysis recognizes and
acknowledges the degree of reliability and integrity of the data.
C. Responsibilities to Science/Public/Funder/Client
The ethical statistician supports valid inferences, transparency, and good science in
general, keeping the interests of the public, funder, client, or customer in mind (as well as
professional colleagues, patients, the public, and the scientific community).
D. Responsibilities to Research Subjects
The ethical statistician protects and respects the rights and interests of human and animal
subjects at all stages of their involvement in a project. This includes respondents to the census or
to surveys, those whose data are contained in administrative records, and subjects of physically
or psychologically invasive research.
E. Responsibilities to Research Team Colleagues
Science and statistical practice are often conducted in teams made up of professionals
with different professional standards. The statistician must know how to work ethically in this
environment.
F. Responsibilities to Other Statisticians or Statistics Practitioners

The practice of statistics requires consideration of the entire range of possible
explanations for observed phenomena, and distinct observers drawing on their own unique sets
of experiences can arrive at different and potentially diverging judgments about the plausibility
of different explanations. Even in adversarial settings, discourse tends to be most successful
when statisticians treat one another with mutual respect and focus on scientific principles,
methodology and the substance of data interpretations.
G. Responsibilities Regarding Allegations of Misconduct
The ethical statistician understands the differences between questionable statistical,
scientific, or professional practices and practices that constitute misconduct. The ethical
statistician avoids all of the above and knows how each should be handled.
An 8th Guideline Principle is specific for employers:
H. Responsibilities of Employers, Including Organizations, Individuals, Attorneys, or
Other Clients Employing Statistical Practitioners
Those employing any person to analyze data are implicitly relying on the profession’s
reputation for objectivity. However, this creates an obligation on the part of the employer to
understand and respect statisticians’ obligation of objectivity.
Because this article is focused on the practitioner as steward, Table 3 does not include GL
Principle H. We revisit GL Principle H in the final section, however, as it does relate specifically
to how the steward contributes to a culture of ethical practice (strengthening the profession) by
promoting an ethical workplace environment and, in the case where the steward employs or
manages statisticians or data scientists, following ASA GL Principle H (and ACM CE 3).

The row marginals in Table 3 show that between 3-7 of the seven core ASA Ethical Guideline
Principles are aligned with each stewardship dimension. Every ASA Ethical Guideline Principle
is relevant for every quantitative practitioner - and practicing according to these Principles is
clearly relevant for stewardship of the profession of statistics and the practice of data
analysis/data science. Both Tables 2 and 3 show that professional behaviors that are consistent
with the ASA Guidelines and the ACM CE (rows) can also generate evidence of stewardship of
the discipline or profession (columns).
Note that there is a bit more overlap - alignment is stronger- between ASA GL Principles and the
stewardship KSAs (i.e., the marginals are greater in Table 3 compared to Table 2). Because there
are so many more ASA GL elements (52 compared with 28 for the ACM), there is a bit more
material to align. The construct of stewardship was originally formulated to describe those
completing the PhD, which is the research degree designating the holder to be qualified to do
research in their field. Statistics is a discipline that all scientists, and most researchers, use, so
ethical statistical practice happens to be described in terms that are highly consistent with those
of stewardship. While computers are almost universally used in research, the level of reliance on
computation (covered by the ACM CE) in research and science is not as high as it is for statistics
(which is essential in both data science and any experimental design/analysis); thus, the language
of the ACM principles may not be as compatible with that of the stewardship KSAs as the ASA
GL elements are. It is important to note that all three of these (ACM CE, ASA GLs, and the
construct of stewardship) were created completely independently of each other – so the fact that
there is any overlap at all is evidence of the reliability of the alignment you see in Tables 2 and 3,
as well as a consensus towards what constitutes “good practice” for stewardly and ethical
statistics and data science.
Tables 2 and 3 show that, as you integrate stewardship KSAs into your training and your own
self-directed professional development, you will create opportunities to demonstrate both the
ACM CE and the ASA GL elements. Similarly, if you were to shift focus to a professional
identity consistent with statistics and data science, and focus your self-directed development on
the ASA GLs and/or ACM CE, you will create opportunities to demonstrate most, if not all, of
the KSAs of stewardship. The KSAs of stewardship are consistent with the ASA GLs and ACM
CE; these can be used together to reinforce one another – and to preserve/promote the integrity
of data science - throughout a career.
It is also important to recognize that these practice standards can be useful to you in many
different ways – they are not intended for your reference only when a problem arises (although it
is hoped that they will be useful then as well!). You do not have to be a member of the
organization for their ethical guidelines to apply to you: as both the ASA and ACM note, if you
perform functions that constitute part of professional practice in these fields, then the
professional practice standards will apply to your behavior and performance. There are
additional considerations that must also be acknowledged:
• Knowing that there are these GLs/CE can help you start to formulate a professional
identity. Committing to following and upholding these – which is actually one of the
ACM CE elements (4.2) and is also threaded throughout the KSAs of stewardship (Rios
et al. 2019) is the first step.

•

It is not ethical to selectively follow some of the GLs or CE elements (the ones you
prefer), but it is also true that some of the GL/CE elements may never, or only rarely,
pertain to you – even if your job title is “statistician”, “data scientist” or “computational
machinist”. The difference here is the choice: it is not ethical to choose which Principles
or elements to follow, but it is consistent with stewardly practice if some of the elements
never apply (e.g., “use care when modifying or retiring systems.” (ACM 3.6) might be
limited to those with leadership roles).
There are seven different ASA GL principles and four different ACM GL principle areas,
but these are interrelated –within and across the standards. The practitioner (data
scientist, statistician, computational machinist) has responsibilities in each of those areas.
Although separately described, Principles or elements may actually come into play
simultaneously in any situation – which underscores the assertion that simply
memorizing the contents of these documents is not sufficient. The steward/ethical
practitioner must also learn how to prioritize the different principles, in order to make
ethical and stewardly decisions that can be justified. Both the ACM and ASA standards
articulate this.
There is one area in both the ASA and ACM GLs that relate to “the employer”. For the
ASA, this area is H: “responsibilities of employers”, while for the ACM, this area is 3
(Professional Leadership Principles). These are important to note because while you are
responsible to your discipline and the disciplinary community to practice ethically and in
a stewardly manner, your employer has -and you, if you employ or manage others, havea responsibility to promote and protect ethical and stewardly behavior.
It is never acceptable to seek or create “loopholes” in the GLs/CE (unless you also seek
to fix/close them). If an unexpected ethical challenge arises, the steward seeks guidance,
not exceptions, in the GLs/CE. To try and justify unethical or underspecified behaviors
(“no one said I couldn’t!”) is unprofessional, unethical, and not stewardly.

5. Checklists instead of practice guidelines?
While professional practice standards exist and are maintained to enable professional identity
formation and to promote a coherent view of the profession by the public and other stakeholders
(Tractenberg et al. 2015), concerns about data safety, privacy and confidentiality have grown as
technology has allowed more and more of our personal data to be collected and used. In the face
of growing concerns about safety, privacy, and unethical commercial uses of personal data, many
groups are creating tools and methodologies to “help”. One such tool is the Data Science Ethics
Checklist (DSEC http://deon.drivendata.org/). This tool was designed to support decision
making (i.e., it was intended to be “actionable”), but was developed from the perspective that
“the primary benefit of a checklist is ensuring that we don't overlook important work”. Table 4
explores the alignment of the DSEC with the 8 stewardship KSAS.

Although the DSEC was developed very recently (e.g., in about 2018, inferred from the citations
listed on the deon.org site) and independently of considerations of stewardship (or the ACM
Code of Ethics), the DSEC does call on many of the stewardship KSAs. The deon objectives do
not include a focus on professional identity but do include an acknowledgement that checklists
enable quick(-er) decisionmaking that does include key ethical considerations. The alignment in
Table 4 shows that key stewardly KSAs are at least potentially aligned – while the language is
again, not specific to the scientific context (like the ASA GLs tend to be), contemplating the
DSEC items can support your development of evidence of progress and growth in stewardly
KSAs. However, simply using this or other checklists does not promote growth in stewardship;
and there are key features of professional practice that fall outside of the “project” type that a
checklist must necessarily focus on. For example, the ACM CE includes a section (with 7 items)
focused on leadership, which entails different decisions specific to the role and quite distinct
from those considered in the DSEC. A tool like the DSEC can be useful, but should not supplant
or interfere with professional identity development. “I use a checklist!” is not a professional
identity - “I am a steward of data science!” is.
6. Ethical Reasoning
In other articles on stewardship (Rios et al. 2019; Tractenberg 2019-a) you will have read about
the Mastery Rubric (MR) construct, and specifically how it can be used to promote and facilitate
the development of stewardship. Briefly, a MR is a curriculum development and evaluation tool.
The MR describes the KSAs that are intended to be taught (for a specific curriculum or program
of study), together with concrete and observable performance descriptions that allow the
instructor as well as the learner to monitor (and encourage) progress towards articulated learning
goals. Thus, for a given domain, a MR can be used by an instructor to help ensure that their
course learning goals are consistent with the overall curriculum, but they are also useful to the
learner both in and outside of formal educational programs. A key feature of a MR is that the
learner can use them to make sure they are progressing from one performance level description
to the next – similarly to how we have been revisiting the descriptions of stewardship KSA #1
(Table 1) to consider what a person needs to do in order to demonstrate that they are at the
apprentice level, or to move up to the journeyman level. You can read more about the MR
construct in Tractenberg (2017) or Rios et al. (2019) and Tractenberg (2019-a); the latter two
papers specifically discuss the MR that was created to support teaching, learning, and
development in stewardship.
As noted earlier, the MR for stewardship (MR-S, Rios et al. 2019) outlined the eight knowledge,
skills, and abilities (KSAs) that, when practiced, can generate evidence of a commitment to
being, and performance as, a steward of the discipline, field or profession. Another MR was
created in 2012 outlining KSAs that are involved in reasoning ethically, the MR for ethical
reasoning (MR-ER, Tractenberg & FitzGerald, 2012). Ethical reasoning is an approach to
identifying “responsible” responses to an identified ethical challenge, and choosing among them
in a defensible manner. Ethical Reasoning (ER) KSAs, like all KSAs in every MR, are learnable
and improvable. That means that, like with stewardship, there are ER-specific KSAs to learn, and
the level at which you perform each KSA also changes as you become more sophisticated and
capable.

While the DSEC and the GLs/CE are not static – and are recognized in their respective contexts
as being subject to change across time and as technology develops – ER KSAs are intended to be
both learnable and improvable – just like the stewardship KSAs. This is a set of KSAs that you
can deploy in a planning stage, i.e., before any unethical behaviors can be executed (similar to
the DSEC), or to evaluate what may have gone wrong or what may be going on in an existing
situation. The ER KSAs are actually steps you can walk through:
1. Identification and assessment of one’s prerequisite knowledge;
2. recognition of an ethical issue;
3. identification of relevant decision-making frameworks;
4. identification and evaluation of alternative actions;
5. making & justifying a decision (about the moral issue); and
6. reflection on the decision.
Any practitioner in any field needs to be able to do the KSAs of ethical reasoning in order to
both identify ethical challenges that arise and to make and justify decisions about how to respond
to those challenges. Note that the DSEC referred to earlier (http://deon.drivendata.org/) may
support you identifying and assessing your prerequisite knowledge (ER KSA #1): if you do not
know how to determine if data were obtained with informed consent (Checklist item A. 1), then
you recognize a gap in your prerequisite knowledge and that this gap must be addressed before
any ethical decisions can be made. However, the items on this Checklist are all yes/no questions.
If you answer no to any of them, does it constitute an ethical issue? “Any NO answer creates an
ethical problem” is implied, but what to do if you answer NO to any of them is completely
unspecified. In fact, the ACM CE and ASA GLs also do not direct you as to how exactly you
should do any of the things on the lists – that is left up to your judgment, ability level, and the
specific context in which you practice. This underscores the point that practice in statistics and
data science involves decisions, and it is the practitioner’s responsibility to recognize these
decisions, make them ethically, and justify how these decisions were made. The last two KSAs
(make and justify a decision; and reflect on the decision) are explicit about this, and this is part
of what makes the ER KSAs so compatible with the ACM CE and ASA GLs: all are concerned
with making ethical decisions.
Here are general features of the interactions between the CE and GLs and each ER KSA:
1. Identify and ‘quantify’ your prerequisite knowledge: Before you have done anything and are
still planning, you can use the ASA GLs, ACM EC – and even the data science ethics
checklist – to plan (using the items on all of these documents to make sure that you know, or
have access to, all the information needed to go on in an ethical fashion). For ASA GLs,
Principle A suggests you need a full understanding of the data and the methods, so that
whatever you end up planning will be “valid, interpretable, and reproducible”. For ACM CE,
1.2 states that you need to avoid harm. Looking just at ACM 1.2 and ASA A here shows that
even valid, interpretable and reproducible work that causes harm will be unethical. In fact,
the ASA GL Preamble states, “using statistics in pursuit of unethical ends is inherently
unethical.” So ER KSA #1 actually goes fairly far towards preventing unethical behavior, or
not allowing decisions to do unethical things, when you bring the ASA and ACM guidance to
bear. Just using the DSEC (or any checklist) does not address harm prevention, but rather,
stipulates that the ethical data scientist plans a response to harms that may arise (DSEC E.1)
or unintended uses to which technology may be put (DSEC E.4).

2. Identify or recognize the ethical issue. What about what you are doing, planning, or have
observed is inconsistent with the GLs or EC? What seems “questionable”? Amazingly, this is
the obvious crux of any ethical decision, but is also incredibly difficult! If you look at the
prerequisite knowledge you pulled together for ER KSA #1 above, you might see where an
ethical issue (i.e., a potentially unethical decision, or a behavior someone else has done that
is unethical) can arise or has arisen. Importantly, if you observe someone using statistics or
data science in pursuit of unethical ends, they are violating the purpose of the ASA GLs,
ASA GL Principle A, and ACM CE Principle 1.2. For you to make a decision, however –
about what you should do (or not do), you need to go back to ER KSA #1 above and make
sure you identify all the ACM and ASA elements that you think are violated (or would be
violated) by the specific behavior you are thinking of or observing. Note that these
determinations are also required to identify harms (DSEC E.1) and unintended use/abuse
(DSEC E.4).
3. Identify decision-making frameworks. The ASA GLs and ACM EC describe “the ethical
practitioner”. In formal terms, this makes the guidelines “virtue ethics” decision making
frameworks. When you choose or decide to behave or operate/practice in a way that is
consistent with these frameworks, you are “the ethical practitioner” (so naturally, acting or
deciding inconsistent with these frameworks makes that person unethical). When you are
making decisions using these frameworks, you are generally going to be modeling your
decisions according to “what would the ethical practitioner do in this case?” Another way to
use these frameworks is called “utilitarian”. Formally, this framework can be helpful in
identifying the positive and negative effects of a decision. For the utilitarian perspective, you
need to have a firm idea of what those positive and negative effects would be on, and that can
be very complex to conceptualize. The utilitarian perspective can generally be summarized
as, “how can benefits be maximized while harms are minimized?” However, it is possible for
a decision to maximize benefits to you, or your colleagues, while not minimizing harms to
others; the opposite decision could minimize harms to others but not create any (or possibly
even minimize) benefits to yourself and your colleagues (for more detail on harms and
benefits and determining/prioritizing them, see Tractenberg 2019-b). Because a utilitarian
perspective is so complicated, we focus here on the virtue approach, enabling us to just focus
on what the “ethical practitioner” would do. This ER KSA (identify decision making
framework) is absent from the DSEC by design (it is intended “to provoke conversations
around issues”), whereas both ASA and ACM emphasize their intended uses in the
professional’s decision making.
4. Identify and evaluate alternative actions (on the ethical issue). As noted, the GLs and CE are
intended to support ethical decision making. That means there are at least two options, and
you (the practitioner) must decide which one is most consistent with what the ethical
practitioner would do in this case. Here is an example where the DSEC could really help:
choose the method/approach or whatever (depending on where you are in your project or
workflow) that leads to a “yes” answer on the corresponding DSEC item. If you’re deciding
whether or not to obtain informed consent, or to provide all data contributors with “a clear
understanding of the data uses to which they consent”, you can tell (from the DSEC) that
NOT doing these things leads to a “no” answer on that DSEC item (A.1) – meaning, if you

do NOT do these things, then your data collection work will not be ethical. Every decision
has to be between at least two things: it may be possible to abstract any choice you make in
your work/workflow to something that matches what is on the DSEC. This would change a
difficult-to-decide situation into more of a yes (I decide on something that creates a “yes” for
the DSEC item) or no (I decide on something that creates a “no” for the DSEC item)
decision. As we have discussed, “no” on a DSEC item suggests it is unethical. However, it
might be impossible, or too costly (in time, effort, money, or some combination) to make a
“yes” decision. The crucial thing is, you have now identified that you cannot make a “yes”
decision – and you’ve also discovered why (because of costs). Instead of saying to your boss
or colleagues, “Hey! You can’t do that!”, you can say, “it looks like we need to X, but
according to the ACM/ASA/CDSEC, that could lead to unethical practice or charges that we
are unethical. How can we work around this problem so we can X without doing it
unethically?” What would the ethical practitioner do if s/he had to also do X? If there is no
way for the ethical practitioner to do X, then that is a 3rd option: do not do X.
Note that, if you had not made it this far in your ethical reasoning steps, you might have missed
this – either done X without considering the negative effects, or done nothing because you guess
X is maybe unethical but you’re not sure, so you just skip it or ignore the fact that it might
actually be doable without being unethical. The next person who needs to do X might not think
this carefully about it, and might just do it, even though it is unethical. When you behave in ways
that are not stewardly, it either fails to notify others that there is a risk of non-stewardly behavior,
or it communicates that there is no reason to be stewardly or ethical. This is an example of how
your ethical practice strengthens the whole profession: modeling stewardly behaviors opens that
option up to observation by others, modeling unethical behaviors makes these appear to be
options, which weakens the profession.
5. Make and justify a decision. At work, you make hundreds of decisions all the time. Clearly
you can’t take the time to think this carefully about every single one of them. The point here
is that you have identified an ethical problem (with your ER KSA#2), but not only did you
identify it, you also came up with three alternatives (1. do it, ignore what the ethical
practitioner would have done; 2. find a way to do it in a way that the ethical practitioner
would also do; 3. Determine that there’s no way for an ethical practitioner to do X – it can’t
be done ethically, so do not do X). You might actually be able to justify all three of these
decisions, but clearly two of them are not consistent with the ethical decision making
framework you have chosen. You might think to yourself, “Hey, I can just go back to KSA#3
and choose a different decision making framework so what I want to do is consistent with
that framework!” Remember from section 4 of this article, “It is never acceptable to seek or
create “loopholes” in the GLs (unless you also seek to fix/close them). If an unexpected
ethical challenge arises, the steward seeks guidance, not exceptions, in the ethical GLs. To
try and justify unethical or underspecified behaviors (“no one said I couldn’t!”) is
unprofessional, unethical, and not stewardly.”
6. Reflect on the decision. Depending on the case, or the decision you walked through these
KSAs to make, there might be a huge amount of reflection. You might re-think the decision
periodically throughout your career – new information or technology may come along that
reduces the costs associated with doing X ethically, for example. However, in this case we

want to focus our attention on stewardship. Thinking about the next person who has to think
through this same decision or a similar one, what additional information would be/would
have been helpful to you (was there additional prerequisite knowledge you wish you had)?
Thinking about your experience reasoning your way to an ethical decision, does a decision
like the one you thought through help to create the culture that promotes fluency in ethical
reasoning and/or a more ethical workplace? Obviously, the steward wants the next person
who has to make this or a similar decision to think it through and choose the ethical,
stewardly option. Reflecting on your decision and decision making process may increase the
likelihood of the next decision maker doing so in a stewardly way.
If you encountered resistance at work (or school) as you tried to work through a difficult
decision, as you attempted to ensure that your practice is consistent with the CE, GLs, the DSEC,
or “what the ethical practitioner would do”, reflect on that. This article is intended to support
your growth and your ethical practice. Not all workplaces, peers, or supervisors will be as
interested in your stewardship as you should be, and just as employers can choose the “best”
candidate for the data science jobs they have available, you can also choose to work in the “best”
and most stewardly climate. The ASA GLs have one Principle that we mentioned in Section 4
but left out of the alignment table with stewardship KSAs (Table 3) - because it is not about you,
the steward/ethical practitioner, but is instead about those who employ statisticians and data
scientists. This is Principle H, which is presented here in its entirety:
H. Responsibilities of Employers, Including Organizations, Individuals, Attorneys, or
Other Clients Employing Statistical Practitioners
Those employing any person to analyze data are implicitly relying on the profession’s reputation
for objectivity. However, this creates an obligation on the part of the employer to understand and
respect statisticians’ obligation of objectivity.
Those employing statisticians are expected to:
1. Recognize that the Ethical Guidelines exist, and were instituted, for the protection and
support of the statistician and the consumer alike.
2. Maintain a working environment free from intimidation, including discrimination based
on personal characteristics; bullying; coercion; unwelcome physical (including sexual)
contact; and other forms of harassment.
3. Recognize that valid findings result from competent work in a moral environment.
Employers, funders, or those who commission statistical analysis have an obligation to
rely on the expertise and judgment of qualified statisticians for any data analysis. This
obligation may be especially relevant in analyses that are known or anticipated to have
tangible physical, financial, or psychological impacts.
4. Recognize that the results of valid statistical studies cannot be guaranteed to conform to
the expectations or desires of those commissioning the study or the statistical
practitioner(s).
5. Recognize that it is contrary to these Guidelines to report or follow only those results that
conform to expectations without explicitly acknowledging competing findings and the
basis for choices regarding which results to report, use, and/or cite.
6. Recognize that the inclusion of statistical practitioners as authors, or acknowledgement of
their contributions to projects or publications, requires their explicit permission because it
implies endorsement of the work.

7. Support sound statistical analysis and expose incompetent or corrupt statistical practice.
8. Strive to protect the professional freedom and responsibility of statistical practitioners
who comply with these Guidelines.
Note that hiring you “… creates an obligation on the part of the employer to understand and
respect statisticians’ obligation of objectivity”. Elements 7 and 8 are also specifically relevant
here – not because they are binding on the employer, but because they describe what “the ethical
employer would do”. Note that DSEC items A (A2, Data Collection), C (C1-C5, Analysis), D
(D1-D5, Modeling) and E (E3, Concept Drift) all capture features of objectivity that are essential
to ethical practice of statistics and data science. Whereas privacy arises in relatively few DSEC
items, over half of them are focused on ensuring that the results are objective and robust, but fair
and transparent. Features of the DSEC list ensure competent practice in data science, as do many
of the ASA GL (e.g., Principle A among others) and ACM CE (e.g., Principles 1 and 2). You are
encouraged to be a steward of data science (Tractenberg, 2019-a) and also work for
people/organizations who encourage stewardship and ethical practice. When you become more
familiar with ethical reasoning, and stewardship, you will also become better able to determine
how likely a colleague, supervisor, or employer is to prevent, allow, or encourage you to engage
with these essential features of ethical practice. Reflecting on your ethical decision making can
lead you to understand your workplace, and the culture in which you practice; supporting your
development as a steward of the profession.
7. Conclusions
The everyday practice of data science, as well as statistics and computing, involves decisions.
These decisions are expected to be grounded in professionalism and responsibility – in fact, both
the ACM and ASA state that their guidance for ethical practice are focused on promoting ethical
decision making. The GLs/CE describe professionalism –what the ethical practitioner should do
and not what behaviors to avoid - and outline the professional’s responsibilities.
You should look through the ACM CE and ASA GLs carefully, learning how checklists and
other “shortcuts” that may continue to proliferate actually impact your stewardship. Some may
be useful tools (like the DSEC) but others may be problematic – and your reflection and
application of ethical reasoning KSAs can help you communicate strengths and weaknesses of
these approaches to your colleagues. Future and current practitioners in statistics and data
science should be familiar with the content of the GLs and CE, and should begin to consider how
these GLs may come into play at work– whether they are at an early stage of career preparation
or are well into their career. Ethical practice is something to continuously strive for. The practice
standards describe the professional habits of all practitioners in statistics and data science; ethical
practice in government (e.g., Bureau of Labor Statistics; Census), industry (e.g., business;
pharmaceutical; biomedical), social science fields (decision making/marketing;
industrial/organizational), and scholarship, among other areas. Ethical reasoning can be
challenging, but its KSAs are learnable and improvable, just like the KSAs of stewardship are.
Further reading that features applying the ER KSAs in practice with the ASA Ethical GLs
specifically is Gunaratna & Tractenberg (2016). That walks the reader through the ethical
reasoning in two cases that the ethical practitioner needs to respond to (other people behaving in
ways inconsistent with the GLs).

The professional practice standards (ACM/ASA) are careful and complete, and also could be
used for many different technological groups including computer science, math, statistics,
informatics, and other disciplines where data are involved. As such, learning to reason ethically
with either or both of these codes/guidelines will serve as an excellent basis to develop your
stewardship as a data scientist.
