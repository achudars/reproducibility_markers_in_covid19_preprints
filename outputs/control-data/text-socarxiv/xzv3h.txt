Abstract
Since diglossia has an immense impact on formal instruction, the present paper aims to
detect teachers’ as well as pupils’ attitudes towards the forms of Arabic at play, Modern
Standard Arabic on the one hand and Algerian Arabic on the other. To achieve the aims of
this study, and try to find an answer as to the way teachers and learners react to Modern
Standard Arabic and Algerian Arabic in attitudinal terms inside the school context, two
instruments were utilized to collect data. First, a questionnaire was administered to a
sample consisting of 12 teachers and then, the matched-guise technique was designed to
72 pupils from two different primary schools. Based on both a quantitative and qualitative
approaches, the findings of this empirical study reveal that both teachers and pupils display
positive attitudes towards Modern Standard Arabic since it is granted an outstanding
predominance and prestige in the community, especially because of its tight association
with the Qur’an. However, the findings also reveal that pre-school grade pupils hold a less
positive attitude towards Modern Standard Arabic and favour Algerian Arabic instead.

Attitudes towards Diglossia in an Algerian Educational Context

HAMZAOUI

Introduction
Ferguson, (1959) stated that Arabic is often considered a ‘diglossic’ language
designating the existence of a High variety (H) and a low variety (L). These varieties are
kept separate and used in distinct settings and for distinct purposes. This sociolinguistic
situation stands as an obstacle as far as formal instruction is concerned since Modern
Standard Arabic (MSA) is the form that is standardized and taught in schools whereas the
vernaculars used primarily for daily concerns and spoken communication, are not taught
formally in schools.
This study was inspired by the following quotations brought by the daughter’s author
and her classmate whose age is eight. The conversation took place at home using a mobile
phone via viber application.
[ʔana nkraɦ lɜarbija ɜlaχatər menfhemɦeʃ bsaħ nħebɦa ɜlaχatər hija taɜ ʔalaɦ wkajna
felqurʔan] meaning, I hate Arabic (with special reference to MSA) because I do not
understand it, but I like it belongs to Allah and it is found in the Qur’an.
Thereafter, my daughter replied [ʔ ana nħebɦa ɜla χater ħna ɜarəb we msəlmin] meaning,
I like it because we are Arabs and Muslims.
This small conversation triggered off a serious discussion among the author’s family
members as to the current attitudes towards MSA. As a result, she wondered the kind of
attitudes displayed by both pupils and teachers towards the Arabic language with its
discrepant forms - MSA and Algerian Arabic (AA) at primary level.
To explore the attitudes displayed by teachers and pupils towards MSA and AA, this
study was conducted in two different primary schools in Tlemcen, a town located in the
northwest of Algeria.
1. Diglossia as a sociolinguistic phenomenon
Ferguson (1959) explains that diglossia is “a relatively stable situation” involving the
existence of a superposed, highly codified variety “largely acquired by formal education
and is used for most written and formal spoken purposes” (Ferguson, 1959, p.336), but
alternating in the community with a ‘low’ variety, the real mother tongue used for daily
activities.
However, Ferguson’s original version of diglossia has been subject to criticism and
discussed extensively even by Ferguson himself who has admitted some flaws in a much
more new article called ‘Diglossia revisited’ (1991). Indeed, the emergence of Educated
Spoken Arabic (ESA), a new intermediate variety of Arabic, is usually cited as evidence
that diglossia is undergoing a considerable change, and as Mahmoud (1986) correctly
mentions,
Diglossia is not an unchanging, stable phenomenon as it may have appeared to
Ferguson, and ESA is a definite harbinger of change in the Arabic speech
community since it seems to be bridging successfully the gap between the two

forms of Arabic and increasingly satisfying the communicative needs of its
elite. (p. 247)
The present paper is concerned with Arabic diglossia, which strongly affects the
learning and teaching processes, and consequently, pupils and teachers may display
different attitudes towards MSA and colloquial Arabic.
2. Arabic Diglossia
It is presumed that Arab people have been acquainted with ‘diglossia’ since the preIslamic period during which every tribe owned its proper dialect, and a common standard
dialect (Cordoba, 2007, p. 143). Yet, it was only later that the colloquial forms became
established and their phonology and syntax matured.
If the structural and functional criteria are applied to the language situation in Arabic,
we evidently notice that Arabic entails “two or more varieties which exist side by side with
each other and have specific kinds of structural and functional relationships” (Nuri, 2013,
p. 341). In fact, one of the most significant peculiarities of diglossia -which is directly
implicated for the acquisition of literacy skills-, is the establishment of rigid and
complementary functional separation of two linguistic codes: the written and the spoken
(Ferguson, 1959). Before they attain school age, some Arab children may learn a small
amount of H, but many have relatively little or no contact with it. Therefore, the two forms
are conceived as possessing a different degree of prestige, as is the case, for example, in
Algeria where both MSA and AA are used.
Maamouri (1998) believes that the standardization of Arabic which began in the 8th and
9th centuries AD, has produced a set of norms that the early grammarians called fusħa.
Arab people perceive fusħa as ‘pure’ and ‘real’ Arabic and the vernaculars as ‘corrupt’
forms. Moreover, Arabs’ attitudes towards the state of their language adhere to a generally
unconcerned pattern: “the only language whose existence is socially acknowledged is the
prestigious MSA, whereas dialectal Arabic has historically never been given much
importance or recognition, since it has always been considered a bastardization of the
original, ‘pure’ language” (Horn, 2015, p. 2). For most Algerians, MSA is perceived as the
‘real’ and ‘correct’ form used in formal contexts, while AA is the mother tongue of most
people, for it only conveys social and cultural feelings.
3. Language attitudes
Attitude is a central state of mind that develops certain reactions towards the
object/person which may lead to anticipate either a negative or positive behaviour.
The study of language attitudes entails various methods such as the
analysis of societal treatment of language varieties, direct assessment with
interviews or questionnaires, in addition to indirect assessment with the
speaker evaluation paradigm (Hamzaoui, 2017, p.67).

HAMZAOUI

The ‘matched-guise’ technique has been promoted by Lambert (1967) and his colleagues;
it sets an example of the indirect assessment method based on mentalist conceptions which
was introduced to measure language attitudes in a French-Canadian bilingual context.
The principal purpose of this technique is to extract information from the informants by
making them listen to a piece of speech performed by the same interlocutor in different
guises while the informants in question do not realize that the interlocutor is the same for
all guises. The subjects will assuredly demonstrate feelings and different attitudes towards
‘each interlocutor’.
The prestige of H in the Arab communities remains homogeneous and incontestable even
when sometimes people do not possess the capacity to comprehend it efficiently, by
contrast to the western world where language attitudes are broadly affected by language
policies commonly advocating the variety of the capital city as the national and official
language of the country. Indeed, the attitudes of Arabs towards MSA “seem to be
unanimously positive not only among Arabic speakers but also among large numbers of
non-Arab Muslims as a result of its association with the Qur’an and its religious
significance as a whole.”, as Dendane (2007, p.266) writes, in addition to the huge bulk of
Arabic literature.
In Algeria, just like in the rest of the Arab countries, MSA is highly appreciated because
it is considered the ‘supra-language’ exceptionally for its irrefutable status as the language
of the Holy Qur’an and the Hadeeth (traditions) of Prophet Mohammed (Peace be upon
him). Dendane (2007) says in this respect
the fact that a number of Qur’anic verses insist on bringing up this
inextricable link between Arabic and the Holy Book makes people believe
that the language of the Qur’an cannot be surpassed, and thereby hold it in
the highest regard, though in practice it is a lower-status variety that people
use in everyday speech interaction (pp,263-264).
Evidently, Arab children may display either positive or negative attitudes towards this
prestigious variety once entering school, as they do not acquire it natively, but for Arabs in
general, MSA enjoys prestige and power unlike the various colloquial forms, which are
assumed to be socially disapproved and stigmatized. “In Arabic, people talk about the high
variety as being ‘pure’ Arabic and the dialects as being ‘corrupt’ forms” (Hamzaoui, 2013,
p. 28).
As already stated, this study aims to detect pupils’ and teachers’ attitudes towards
Algerian Arabic and MSA at primary school level. The assessment of the pupils’
personalities and the form of Arabic is based on traits such as pleasantness and cleverness.
4. Sample, method and results
The sample population of this study has been chosen randomly from two different
primary schools situated in Tlemcen (a town located in the north west of Algeria). It

includes 72 pupils (six pupils from each grade and from two distinct primary schools) and
12 teachers (six teachers from each selected primary school). The rate of the pupils’ group
as compared to the rate of the teachers’ group is adroitly higher since the present study
focuses on the learners’ rather than on the teachers’ attitudes towards diglossia and the
number of pupils neatly exceeds that of teachers at schools. One particular concern that
relates to the fieldwork is that the learners under investigation necessitate cautious attention
and consideration from the part of the investigator since they are too young and their age
does not go beyond ten. It is also worth mentioning that the native language of these pupils
is AA.
4.1 Diglossia and pupils’ attitudes
The matched-guise technique was outlined to evoke the informants’ attitudes towards
the Arabic forms at play by making them listen to a text passage performed in two forms
(MSA/AA) by the same person, which might make them feel they are listening to two
persons. Thereafter, the informants were asked to reply to a set of questions that disclose
their attitudes towards the language forms tested. A text composed of two passages from
‘Cinderella’ story was read at a natural speed rate by the same person. It was first narrated
in MSA, and then in AA (see Appendix A). In order to obtain different attitudes, we have
divided the 72 informants into six different groups studying in different primary schools
from pre-school grade until the fifth grade. The tables and graphs below will demonstrate
the evaluations of the whole group of judges on two dimensions, namely, the assessment
of the speakers’ personalities and the form of Arabic in terms of pleasantness and
cleverness traits.
-Pleasantness and attitude
Question n° 1: Who is more pleasant?
When this question was posed, the respondents provided the data mentioned in table 1
where the results in a ‘pleasantness degree’ are shown in contrasting views of those who
declared pupil1 as opposed to pupil2/ ‘I do not know’. Indeed, the majority of the pupils
from different grades to the exception of pre-school grade clearly favoured pupil1, and
considered him ‘more pleasant’ than pupil 2, as clearly shown in table 1.

Most pupil respondents revealed that the performer in the first guise (G1- MSA) is the
most pleasant except for pre-school pupils. This means that the pupils from first up to the
fifth grade hold MSA speech in high esteem and consider the performer using AA as quite
unpleasant, mainly because the speech in this guise (G2- AA) is characterized by the glottal
stop ( specific to Tlemcenian speech), and the majority of the informants consider this as
erroneous for the learning process.
Question n°2: How would you judge these pupils if they were your classmates?
Here, the informants were asked to express their attitudes towards G1 and G2 by
putting a cross in the square blanks they think convenient for the trait suggested.

Similarly, the findings on the characteristic of ‘cleverness’ reveal a clearly upgrading
scores ranging from 8.33% for the pre-school grade to 91.66% for the 5th grade. First, lower
scores are ascribed to the pre-school pupils who claimed that G1 is clever, then, as far as
we moved gradually to the other grades, we noticed that higher scores are attributed to
those who considered G1 as the ‘cleverest’.
However, the scores obtained on which guise sounds cleverer for G2 seem to contradict
with those above, i.e., to the exception of the pre-school grade pupils, most pupils from the
other grades found G2 as ‘less clever’. Consider the table below and its equivalent graph.

Figure. 2 Pupils’ evaluation of cleverness (G2)
Positive attitudes are obvious and apparent in the data collected as regards ‘cleverness’
trait in G1, and negative attitudes about the speaker using AA who was concidered as ‘less
clever’ are also clear-cut. For the majority of the informants, the performer using AA in
class does not adhere and is breaking the rule of conversation. Nevertheless, pupils from
pre-school grade perceived performer 1 using MSA as ‘less clever’ and performer 2 using
AA as clever. This might be explained that this particular category of pupil respondents
has relatively no acquaintance with MSA outside the school context, and that they are still
unfamiliar with this variety and unaware about its importance in the learning process.
4.2 Diglossia and teachers’ attitudes
On another front, and in order to evaluate the teachers’ reactions towards MSA and AA,
a questionnaire based on a psychological factor was administered to 12 teachers from
different primary schools who teach at different grades and having different skills and
experiences. The respondents were asked to reveal their attitudes towards MSA/ AA on the
basis of three questions (see Appendix B).

The discernible findings gathered from the variety by which the teachers prefer
explaining their lessons was MSA. Ostensibly, most teacher respondents (83.33%)
affirmed their preference and inclination towards MSA use in class, despite the reality,
which reveals that most of them use a mixture of both MSA and AA in the teaching process,
believing that this strategy may help pupils’ assimilation.
Question n°2: Which form do you think is more beautiful?
All the respondents confirmed the beauty of MSA as well as their high appreciation
towards it, for they consider MSA as the real and correct variety used as a medium of
instruction.
Question n° 3: Which form of Arabic do you think more appropriate for the teaching/
learning process?

When asked about the most appropriate variety for the teaching/learning process,
similar results as those mentioned in question n°1 were obtained, that is, most teachers
agreed on the appropriateness of MSA in the teaching/ learning process. The high rate of
the informants’ replies echoes their extensive recognition of MSA significance as a
medium of instruction and their consciousness of its high status amongst the whole Arab
and Muslim nations.

4.3 Discussion
In their highly acclaimed responses about their attitudes towards MSA/AA, the pupils
from first up to the fifth grade revealed their abundant appreciation towards MSA and felt
proud of it owing to its sacred status and relation to Classical Arabic, the language of the
Holy Qur’an. This feeling emerges from the Arab society perspective to MSA and the
conservative nature of the Algerian society in which they live. Maamouri (1998, p.37) says
in this respect, “there is a prevailing feeling among Arabs that their language is imbued
with a natural superiority”.
In spite of this high value, the pupils from pre-school grade held MSA in low esteem and
favoured AA instead. However, taking into account their small age, we cannot deduce that
this particular category of learners show negative attitudes towards MSA because they do
not find it beautiful, correct or expressive. However, the reasons range from their
perception that MSA is quite difficult to learn and understand, and that it is not their mother
tongue. This lack of security comes from a general feeling of low understanding of MSA
and of low identification of its norms (Maamouri, 1998, p. 37).

HAMZAOUI

Similarly, the teachers’ responses reflected their homogeneous attitudes towards
MSA/AA. Indeed, all the teachers feel proud and show positive attitudes towards MSA that
might contribute to various reasons such as linguistic awareness, realization of MSA high
significance in the teaching/ learning process, and most importantly as the language of the
Qur’an. Nevertheless, in spite of the acknowledged high esteem towards MSA, we firmly
believe that the maintenance of AA in the teaching process will remain, unless there will
be a general agreement amongst all teachers of the Arabic course concerning its avoidance.
5. Conclusion
The conclusions for this study can be summarised under the following points. First, the
present paper reveals high appreciation in attitudinal terms towards MSA from the part of
both teachers and learners, for they perceive it as the ‘pure’, ‘real’ ‘and ‘correct’ form used
in formal education, and more importantly as the language of the Qur’an. Second, negative
reactions displayed by pre-school grade pupils relate to their perception that learning
Standard Arabic is a strenuous process. This can relate to the fact that this particular
category of pupils have relatively little or no contact with the official language of
instruction outside the school milieu. They also perceive the standard variety as an
‘unfamiliar’ language and they are still unaware about the importance of this variety of
Arabic in their learning strategies. Arab children’s regular exposure to this variety before
school age might facilitate its use and comprehension years later.
