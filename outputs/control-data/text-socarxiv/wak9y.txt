Abstract
Working part-time is frequently considered a viable strategy for employees to better combine work and non-work responsibilities. The present
study examines differences in satisfaction with the work–family balance
(SWFB) among professional and non-professional part-time service sector employees in five western European countries. Part-time employees
were found to be more SWFB than full-time employees even after taking
varying demands and resources into account. However, there are important differences among the part-timers. Employees in marginal part-time
employment with considerably reduced working hours were the most satisfied. Professionals were found to profit less from reduced working hours
and experienced lower levels of SWFB than non-professionals. No significant differences in SWFB were found between male and female part-time
workers.

Introduction
Helping employees to reach a satisfactory balance between work and personal life
has become an important issue in human resource management in recent years
because work–family balance (WFB) has been associated with greater employee

Research for this study was partly supported by the European Commission through funding
of the cross-national collaborative research project ‘Quality of Life in a Changing Europe’
(Bäck-Wiklund et al., 2011), within which the data were collected. The authors would like to

commitment and job satisfaction (Carlson et al., 2009). The absence of balance,
typically conceived of as high levels of conflict between work and non-work domains, has been associated with higher turnover intentions and absenteeism,
and lower employee performance (see Eby et al., 2005, for an overview). Organizations have implemented policies and practices which provide employees with
more flexibility and autonomy in managing their work and non-work responsibilities. In this context, part-time work is often regarded as essential to achieving a
balance between work and family life and is advocated by national governments
and the European Union. In many European countries, working reduced hours
has become a customary strategy for combining paid employment and family responsibilities, especially for women with young children (Gasparini et al., 2000).
However, part-time work appears in many forms and variations. The proportion of part-time workers and the characteristics of part-time jobs vary between
countries, industrial sectors and occupations (Sándor, 2011). Part-time work
also plays different roles for different employee groups. On the one hand it has
been treated as a non-standard, precarious type of employment for less qualified
employees (Tilly, 1996; Kalleberg, 2000), on the other hand it may be considered
a win–win solution for professional employees and employers which facilitates
employees’ WFB, keeps women in the labor market instead of leaving it (and
thus preserves human capital) and increases employment flexibility (Mills and
Täht, 2011; Tomlinson, 2007). Implemented as an organizational policy to improve employees’ WFB, part-time work is thought to provide employees with
more convenient working hours, decrease conflict, stress and exhaustion, and
enable them to better meet their personal and family responsibilities (Barnett
and Gareis, 2002; Hakim, 2004). However, empirical studies about part-time
work and WFB have reported inconsistent findings. Whereas research among
professional women in high-level jobs reported a positive link between part-time
employment and their WFB (Hill et al., 2004a,b), reduced working hours have
been found to have negative implications for the work–life balance of workingclass employees (Lautsch and Scully, 2007).
The present study aims at providing insight into the relationship between
part-time employment and WFB from a European perspective. Drawing on the
scarcity (also referred to as resource drain or depletion) argument in work–family
research (Edwards and Rothbard, 2000; Goode, 1960; Greenhaus and Beutell,
1985), the present study examines part-time employees’ satisfaction with their
work–family balance (SWFB) in service sector organizations in five western European countries (Sweden, the United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Germany,
and Portugal). According to official statistics, part-time work is dominated by
women and the largest proportion of part-time workers in the European Union
is employed in the lower-grade and lower-paid occupations, predominantly in
service sector industries (Sándor, 2011). In practice, part-time schedules are

2

very heterogeneous, ranging from work hours long enough to almost be classified as full-time to a very short schedule of just a few hours per week. However,
academic scholars only recently started distinguishing between different types
of part-time work in empirical studies (Martin and Sinclair, 2007; Wittmer and
Martin, 2011a,b). Contributing to this new strand of research, the present study
does not treat part-time workers as a homogeneous group but distinguishes between marginal and substantial part-time employees (Bielenski et al., 2002). In
addition, we examine the differences between professional and non-professional
as well as male and female part-time employees. Previous research on parttime work and the work–family interface has often focused on highly qualified
women only (Higgins et al., 2000; Hill et al., 2004a,b), thereby neglecting that
female employees in lower-level occupations and men may experience part-time
employment very differently. Finally, our study also contributes to a growing
branch of international work–family literature by investigating service sector
employees’ SWFB in a non-US study context, in which the majority of research
on WFB has hitherto been conducted (Hill et al., 2004b; Tausig and Fenwick,
2001; Valcour, 2007) and in which the implications of working part-time (usually
no entitlement to employee benefits such as health insurance for part-timers, a
24/7 economy with a high prevalence of night-shifts and other non-standard
working hours, comparatively weak employment protection) are very different
from the contexts we are studying.
To begin with, we introduce the construct of ‘SWFB’ and provide a brief
overview of the corresponding literature. We then contrast the theoretical potential of part-time work to increase SWFB with inconsistent empirical findings,
and suggest that variation in part-time working arrangements might be at the
core of the problem. Then, a set of study hypotheses is developed and tested.
The study concludes with a discussion of the results, study limitations, future
research suggestions and practical implications.

Satisfaction with work–family balance
Despite its widespread use in both the popular and the academic press, the
term ‘work–family balance’ is an underdeveloped concept in work–family literature (Carlson et al., 2009). Early definitions of the construct rest upon the
assumption that WFB is an individual choice and a personal responsibility,
thereby ignoring structural, cultural and gendered constraints and letting organizations and the state off the hook (Carlson et al., 2009; Greenhaus and
Allen, 2011; Grzywacz and Carlson, 2007; Lewis et al., 2007; Ransome, 2007).
In recent literature, WFB is conceived as a social construct that is shaped
by both individual and contextual factors (Drobnič et al., 2010; Drobnič and
Guillén Rodrı́guez, 2011; Präg et al., 2010). Consistent with role balance theory

3

(Marks and MacDermid, 1996), Grzywacz and Carlson (2007) define WFB as
the ‘accomplishment of role-related expectations that are negotiated and shared
between an individual and his or her role-related partners in the work and family domains’ (p. 458). Furthermore, they suggest uncoupling accomplishment of
role-related activities from effectiveness and satisfaction in definitions of WFB.
The present study focuses on the satisfaction component of WFB and examines employees’ levels of SWFB. Valcour (2007) defined SWFB as ‘individuals’
assessments that they have adequate resources to effectively respond to the demands of their work and family roles’ (p. 19). It is a unitary, holistic construct
consisting of two components: A cognitive component, including an appraisal
of a person’s ability to meet multiple work and family demands, and an affective component, including positive feelings as a result of this appraisal (Valcour,
2007). SWFB was found to be negatively related to working hours, commuting
time, job demands, career demands, job insecurity, and work-to-family conflict.
It was positively related to job complexity, job control, and social support at
work (Beham et al., 2010; Clarke et al., 2004; Szücs et al., 2011; Valcour, 2007).

Part-time work and work–family balance
Research on working hours and the work–family interface is mainly founded
on the scarcity argument (Edwards and Rothbard, 2000; Goode, 1960; Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985). The scarcity argument posits that individuals have
a finite amount of time available that can be devoted to multiple roles in life.
Time devoted to work will not be available for engagement in the private domain. Hence, long working hours may create conflicts for employees, which
may lead to a preference for shorter working time (Lautsch and Scully, 2007).
The most frequently cited reason for a reduction in working hours by employees
in the European Union is indeed the need to better combine work and family responsibilities (Bielenski et al., 2002). However, research investigating the
impact of reduced working hours on work–family outcomes yielded ambiguous and sometimes contradicting findings. Whereas part-time employees were
found to experience lower levels of role overload and work-to-family conflict and
higher levels of WFB and work–family fit, part-time workers also reported more
physical and mental health problems, a more traditional division of household
responsibilities, less career satisfaction and opportunities, higher job and financial insecurity, lower marital quality, and even poorer work–life balance than
full-timers (Barnett, 2003; Higgins et al., 2000; Hill et al., 2004a,b; Lautsch and
Scully, 2007; Tausig and Fenwick, 2001; Van Rijswijk et al., 2004).
These inconsistent findings may partially be due to a number of methodological and conceptual problems, such as varying definitions of part-time and
full-time work, different reasons for working part-time (voluntary vs. involun-

4

tary part-time work), the varying nature of part-time jobs and differences in
part-time employees’ work and non-work role involvement (e.g. Barnett and
Gareis, 2000; Martin and Sinclair, 2007). The ILO’s Part-Time Work Convention defines a part-time worker as an ‘employed person whose normal hours of
work are less than those of comparable full-time workers’ (ILO, 1994). However,
this definition does not tell us how many hours per week constitute a part-time
job because the number of hours per week considered full-time differs significantly between countries, professions or even activities. In addition, part-time
employees (see Martin and Sinclair, 2007, for a typology of part-time employees)
as well as part-time arrangements themselves are very heterogeneous, including
working hours ranging from close to the full-time standard to just a few hours
per week. Recent research found different groups of part-time employees to differ in job attitudes (e.g. job satisfaction, organizational commitment), levels of
employment mobility and turnover intentions (Wittmer and Martin, 2011a,b).
To account for variations in part-time schedules, Bielenski et al. (2002) suggested distinguishing between marginal (< 20 h per week) and substantial (20–
34 h per week) part-time work. In line with the scarcity argument in work–
family research (Goode, 1960), we argue that working reduced hours may result
in higher levels of SWFB for both marginal and substantial part-time employees,
since part-time employees will be less involved in their work role than full-time
employees, and have more time and energy to devote to their non-work responsibilities. However, we do expect employees in marginal part-time employment
to have an advantage over those working a substantial part-time schedule because of less time commitment to the work domain and fewer organizational
demands (e.g. time pressure and psychological job demands). Accordingly, we
hypothesize the following.
Hypothesis 1. Both marginal and substantial part-time employment
will be positively related to SWFB (a). The relationship will be
stronger for marginal part-time employees (b).
We hypothesize that part-time employees are more SWFB. This may be
due to less demanding, routine jobs and/or more flexible jobs which allow them
to better attend to non-work responsibilities. In addition, part-time employees may work in an organizational environment that is particularly supportive
of their family needs. By allowing employees to work part-time, organizations
officially acknowledge and accept employees’ non-work responsibilities and supervisors and colleagues may be more sensitive towards the family needs of these
employees. In order to find out whether the positive relationship between parttime work and SWFB is due to part-time being prevalent in less demanding
and/or more flexible jobs, several work demands (overtime hours, time pressure, psychological demands, job insecurity) and resources (social support at

5

work, job control) are taken into account in our statistical analyses. Previous
studies have shown that time-based work demands such as long working hours,
overtime hours or organizational time pressure, as well as strain-based work demands such as psychological job demands and job insecurity decrease employees’
SWFB, whereas work resources such as social support at work and job control
increase employees’ SWFB (Beham et al., 2010; Valcour, 2007).

Professional status
Work–family research has mainly focused on part-time work among professional
employees, although there is empirical evidence that part-time work and its influence on employees’ WFB are significantly different for non-professional workers (Lautsch and Scully, 2007). Low-skill part-time jobs tend to offer little job
autonomy, inflexible working environments, limited career opportunities and less
job and financial security (Barnett and Hall, 2001; Beham et al., 2014; Walsh,
2007). In addition, part-time employees in these kinds of jobs are often required
to work irregular hours at the discretion of the employer (Lautsch and Scully,
2007; Wilson et al., 2008). These disadvantages of ‘bad’ part-time jobs may
hamper part-time workers’ ability to better manage their work and non-work
responsibilities. Part-time jobs for professional employees, on the other hand,
may offer appropriate salaries and opportunities for promotion, high levels of job
autonomy and scheduling flexibility. Working part-time, at least temporarily, is
increasingly regarded as an opportunity for professional employees with caring
responsibilities to stay on the career track while gaining a desirable work–life
balance. Empirical studies have in fact shown that professional women in high
quality part-time arrangements reported a significantly greater WFB and less
work-to-family conflict than their full-time working counterparts (Hill et al.,
2004a,b; Van Rijswijk et al., 2004).
Whereas these previous studies have examined differences in work–life balance among part-time and full-time working professionals, we are interested in
whether professional part-time employees differ in their experience of SWFB
from part-time employees in non-professional jobs. Although high-status professional part-time arrangements may offer more resources (e.g. career opportunities, adequate pay, and high levels of job control and workplace flexibility)
than non-professional part-time jobs, these resources may come at the expense
of higher levels of time-based and strain-based job demands (Frone et al., 1992;
Higgins et al., 2000). Professionals may experience more work pressure due to
clients’ demands that need to be satisfied and non-negotiable deadlines. Furthermore, professional work is fluid and less bound by time and space as compared with non-professional work, meaning that starting and finishing times as
well as work sites can vary significantly (Lawrence and Corwin, 2003). These
characteristics of professional work may increasingly blur the boundaries be6

tween work and family/private life and lead to interference between these two
life domains (Clark, 2000). A study among employees in Europe found that
professional workers reported higher levels of conflict between work and family
than non-professionals due to longer working hours and higher levels of work
pressure (McGinnity and Calvert, 2009). Likewise, DiRenzo et al. (2011) found
greater interference between work and family among higher level workers due
to the more extensive job demands and work hours associated with higher level
positions. In line with these findings, we expect that professional status will
moderate the relationship between part-time employment and SWFB in such a
way that professionals working part-time will be less satisfied with their WFB
than part-time non-professionals.
Hypothesis 2. Professional status will moderate the relationship
between part-time employment and SWFB. Professional parttime workers will be less SWFB than non-professional part-time
employees.

Gender
Part-time employment in Europe is dominated by women. Whereas 31.9 per cent
of employed women in the European Union worked part-time in 2010, only
8.7 per cent of employed men did so (Massarelli and Wozowczyk, 2010). Parttime work has become the preferred solution, especially for mothers, to combine
paid employment and caring responsibilities (Sándor, 2011). They frequently
use part-time work as a temporary alternative to full-time employment or leaving the labor market entirely (Buddelmeyer et al., 2005). Despite changing gender role attitudes, gendered behavior in contemporary societies persists: work is
men’s business and family is women’s domain. Women continue to be primarily
responsible for childcare and housework and spend more time in the family role,
while men dedicate more time and effort to the work role (Treas and Drobnič,
2010). In addition, the norm of the ‘ideal worker’ (Acker, 1990), who is fully
devoted to work, works long hours, has no family responsibilities, and thus requires minimal accommodation for personal life, is still very much in place in
contemporary workplaces. Women can hardly approximate to this male norm
of work due to their involvement in unpaid housework and care work (Webber and Williams, 2008). Those trying to simultaneously juggle long working
hours and non-work responsibilities may be caught in a ‘time bind’ (Hochschild,
1997), and experience pressure and tensions as a consequence of incompatible
demands from work and non-work (Greenhaus and Beutell, 1985). A reduction
in working hours may free time for non-work responsibilities, provide women
with more flexibility and consequently increase their ability to reach a satisfying equilibrium between work and family demands. Men’s explanations for

7

working part-time are rarely their family responsibilities. Men are more likely to
be in involuntary part-time employment (due to the fact that they could not find
a full-time job), and they more often combine part-time work with education
than women (Eurostat, 2009). Accordingly, we hypothesize the following.
Hypothesis 3. Gender will moderate the relationship between parttime employment and SWFB. Women working part-time will be
more SWFB than men working part-time.

Methods
Procedure and participants
Survey data were collected among service sector employees in Sweden, the
United Kingdom, The Netherlands, Germany, and Portugal as part of a larger
collaborative research project funded by the European Commission (Bäck-Wiklund
et al., 2011). In each country, part-time and full-time employees working in four
different service sector organizations were surveyed. These organizations were in
financial services, information and communication technology, health care and
retail. Thus, our sample comprises service sector employees in twenty different
organizations in five western European countries.
The questionnaire was developed by the research team in English and was
translated into the national languages of the participating countries using Brislin’s (1986) back-translation method. Pilot studies were conducted prior to data
collection in each country. Data were collected by means of both online surveys
and paper and pencil questionnaires. Response rates in these twenty organizations ranged from 20 per cent to 79 per cent. Further descriptions of the data
can be found in Präg et al. (2011).
Table 1 gives an overview of the sample composition. The total sample
comprises 4,476 part-time and full-time employees. Country samples range from
592 employees in Sweden to 1,137 employees in Portugal, with female survey
participants forming the majority in the sample. Among the participants of the
study, 70.5 per cent were married or have a partner and participants are on
average 40.7 years old.
The distribution of part-time workers in this sample of service sector employees closely reflects the official statistics on part-time employment in Europe
(Massarelli and Wozowczyk, 2010). The proportion of part-time workers is highest in the Netherlands (53.8 per cent), where part-time work has become the
preferred flexible work arrangement to combine work and family responsibilities. In the literature, The Netherlands have also been referred to as the first
part-time economy in the world (Visser, 2002). Part-time work is less common
in Germany (25.9 per cent), Sweden (23.8 per cent) and the United Kingdom

(22.9 per cent), but is still above the European average. It is lowest in Portugal
with only 3.7 per cent of our study participants working a part-time schedule.
In all five countries, national regulations for part-time work are in place, according to which either all employees contingent on the size of the company (e.g.
Germany and The Netherlands) or at least parents with young children (e.g.
United Kingdom, Portugal, and Sweden) are entitled to reduce their working
hours (Sándor, 2011).
Not surprisingly, the majority of part-time workers in this sample are women
(88.6 per cent), with proportions of male part-time workers ranging from 6.4 per cent
in Germany to 37.2 per cent in Portugal. With the exception of Portugal, substantial part-time employment (20–34 h per week) is predominant in all countries. Marginal part-time employment (< 20 h per week) is lowest in Sweden
(11.3 per cent) where most part-time employees work a substantial part-time
schedule that is often close to a full-time schedule (Bielenski et al., 2002). The
proportion of professional part-time employees ranges from 29.8 per cent in
Sweden to 57.2 per cent in Germany.

Measures
SWFB was measured with three items on a five-point Likert scale (1 = very
dissatisfied to 5 = very satisfied) developed by Valcour (2007). An example
item is ‘How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with the way you divide your time
between work and personal life?’ Cronbach’s alpha of the scale was 0.89.
Full-time, substantial part-time and marginal part-time workers are distinguished by using two dummy variables, one for substantial part-time workers (1
= 20–34 contracted hours per week, 0 = other) and one for marginal part-time
workers (1 = < 20 contracted hours per week, 0 = other). Accordingly, the
group of full-time workers will serve as the reference category in our regression
models. Professional status1 is dummy coded, with 1 = professional and 0 =
non-professional. Gender is dummy coded with 1 = female and 0 = male.
Age, marital status, number of children in the household, household income,
selected work demands and resources, and country-dummies (Germany is the
reference category) were included as control variables in the statistical analyses.
Marital status is dummy coded, with 1 = married/cohabiting and 0 = not
married/cohabiting. Household income was measured on a twelve-point scale
1 Survey participants provided the occupational title of their jobs. These descriptions were
coded using the International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO 88), which was
used together with the information on supervisor status and number of employees under supervision to assign participants to the Erikson-Goldthorpe-Portocarero (EGP) classes (Erikson
and Goldthorpe, 1992). These classes, generally referred to as the EGP scheme, consist of
eleven occupational groups allowing for comparative analyses between different employee categories. In our study, ‘high and low controllers’ were collapsed into a new category ‘professionals’. The EGP classes ‘routine non-manual’, ‘routine manual’, ‘skilled-manual’, ‘semi-unskilled
manual’, ‘skilled manual’ and ‘manual supervisor’ were classified as ‘non-professionals’. We
did not have self-employed, small employers and farm workers in our sample.

10

(1 = < 150 Euro; 12 = over 10,000 Euro per month). Overtime hours were
calculated as the difference between actual and contracted working hours per
week. Time pressure was measured with three items on a five-point Likert scale
(1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree) (Dikkers et al., 2004). Five items
taken from the Swedish Demand-Control-Support Questionnaire were used to
measure psychological demands at work (Sanne et al., 2005). Job insecurity was
assessed with a four-item measure based on the work of Sverke et al. (2004) using
a five-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree). Job control
was measured with four items on a four-point scale (1 = never; 4 = always) taken
from Sanne et al. (2005) and Kossek et al. (2006). Work–family support from
supervisors and co-workers was assessed with a six-item scale (Dikkers et al.,
2004). Answers were made on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = strongly disagree; 5 =
strongly agree). Cronbach’s alpha for several multi-item scales were above the
cut-off criteria of 0.70 (see Table 2).

Analytical strategy
Our sample comprises 4,476 individuals working in twenty service sector organizations, which means that observations within one organization are not
independent. To account for this nested data structure, hierarchical linear (random coefficient) modeling is recommended (Raudenbush and Bryk, 2002). We
first estimated an empty, so-called ‘null’ model, which only includes the intercept without any predictors. This model allows us to calculate the intraclass
correlation coefficient (ICC) by partitioning the total variance in the outcome
variable SWFB into its within- and between-organization components and then
calculating the proportion of variance accounted for by the organization level.
The ICC for our null model is 0.047, showing that organizations account for approximately five per cent of the variability in our outcome variable. According
to the rule of thumb, hierarchical linear modeling is recommended if the ICC
is at least 0.05. Gelman and Hill (2007), however, suggest that even when the
ICC is low, hierarchical linear modeling yields more accurate regression coefficients and more correct standard errors than ordinary least square regressions.
Furthermore, they recommend estimating hierarchical linear models even if the
number of Level 2 units is small (e.g. twenty organizations). Accordingly, we
used hierarchical linear models to test our study hypotheses.

Results
Descriptive statistics and Pearson’s correlation coefficients for the study variables (without country dummies) are presented in Table 2.
Using hierarchical linear modeling, we estimated three random intercept
models adding variables in each step. In these models, the regression lines of

the level-2 units (i.e. organizations) were allowed to have different intercepts
but were forced to have the same slope. Alternatively, we also tested random
slope models allowing for organization-specific slopes (Gelman and Hill, 2007),
but model fit did not improve significantly. Consequently, Table 3 reports coefficients of fixed effects and corresponding standard errors, deviance, ICC, and
variance components of the random intercept models.
Model 1 only includes the two variables on part-time work, in Model 2 the
moderators, control variables, and country dummies are added into the equation. Model 3 introduces four interaction terms (marginal part-time × professional status; substantial part-time × professional status; marginal part-time
× gender; substantial part-time × gender) to test the moderating effects of
professional status and gender on the relationship between part-time work and
SWFB. Model 1 shows that both marginal (β = 0.35, p < 0.01) and substantial
part-time workers (β = 0.19, p < 0.01) were more SWFB than full-time workers. Both regression coefficients remain significant even after controlling for
various job demands and resources (Model 2). As predicted, the relationship
was stronger for marginal part-time employees than for substantial part-time
workers, which we confirmed with a χ2 test for differences between the coefficient sizes (χ2 = 6.56, df = 1, p < 0.01). Accordingly, Hypotheses 1a and
1b were supported. Both moderator variables were significantly and negatively
related to SWFB, meaning that professional employees and women were less
SWFB than non-professional employees and men, respectively.
Examining the coefficients for the control variables revealed no significant
country differences. The number of children was negatively related to WFB
(β = −0.08, p < 0.01), meaning that SWFB decreases if the number of children increases. Several job demands were significantly and negatively related
to SWFB, whereas work resources were significantly and positively related to
SWFB. These findings are in-line with previous empirical studies on SWFB (e.g.
Abendroth and den Dulk, 2011; Beham and Drobnič, 2010; Valcour, 2007).
Hypothesis 2 posits that professional part-time employees will be less SWFB
than non-professional part-time employees. Our analysis yielded significant interaction terms for both forms of part-time employment: β = −0.29, p < 0.01
for marginal part-time and β = −0.15, p < 0.01 for substantial part-time (Table 3, Model 3). Figure 1 displays a plot of predicted SWFB, taking the main
effects as well as interactions with professional status into account. The plot
shows that both professional and non-professional part-timers were more SWFB
than full-timers. However, the difference was considerably smaller for professionals than non-professionals. Professional part-time employees experienced
less SWFB than non-professional part-time workers, thereby confirming Hypothesis 2. The difference between professional and non-professional part-time
workers increases as working time decreases, resulting in a particularly pro-

Figure 1: Interaction between part-time work and professional status as related
to SWFB
With respect to the impact of gender, we found that women were less SWFB
(β = −0.10, p < 0.01) than men. This corroborates existing knowledge about
the unequal share of the burden of work and domestic responsibilities between
men and women (Treas and Drobnič, 2010). However, contrary to our predictions we found no significant interaction of gender and part-time employment.
In Hypothesis 3, we had posited that women should benefit more from working
part-time than their male counterparts. But as Table 3 shows, women and men
did not differ significantly in the positive effects of part-time work on SWFB.
This finding also held true when no distinction was made between substantial
and marginal part-timers (β = −0.03, p = 0.68; analysis not shown) and when
the interactions between part-time work and gender were estimated separately
from the interactions between part-time work and professional status. Accordingly, Hypothesis 3 was not supported.

Discussion
The main purpose of this study was to analyze satisfaction with work–life balance among part-time service sector employees with varying part-time schedules,
professional status and gender in five western European countries. Recent research suggested that part-time employees cannot be treated as a homogeneous
group (Martin and Sinclair, 2007). To account for variation among part-time
employees, we distinguished between marginal and substantial part-time employment (Bielenski et al., 2002). Our analysis revealed that part-time employees are more SWFB than full-time employees above and beyond of what
it is accounted for by job demands and resources. The relationship is stronger
for part-time employees working a marginal schedule of less than 20 hours per
week than for those working a substantial part-time schedule of between 20 and
34 hours. Although part-time work may bring disadvantages in terms of pay,
career prospects and benefits, these findings suggest that shorter working hours
are beneficial for attaining a satisfactory work–life balance. Part-time workers
who were able to substantially reduce their working hours are better able to
attend to their non-work responsibilities and consequently report higher levels
of SWFB.
The study further investigated whether differences in SWFB between fulltime and part-time employees can be found among both non-professional and
professional workers. In an effort to retain highly qualified staff, especially
women, organizations have begun to offer part-time employment options for
professional workers and managers (Barnett and Hall, 2001). These arrangements aim to allow professionals to stay on the career track while achieving a
satisfactory work–life balance. However, our research shows that professional
part-time employees profit less from shorter working time than non-professionals
(Figure 1). The difference between professional and non-professional part-timers
is particularly large for employees in marginal part-time jobs below 20 hours per
week. These findings could be due to the nature of professional work itself. As
a rule, professionals do experience a substantial level of autonomy at their work
place, which they acquire and sustain through their specific knowledge, training and social status within organizations. However, professional work is often
not confined to rigid timetables, and employers frequently expect a high level
of availability from their professional employees. Being called in for a meeting
unexpectedly, and keeping in touch with clients, subordinates and colleagues
during the negotiated times of absence are common for professional part-time
employees (Lawrence and Corwin, 2003). Blurred boundaries between work
and home, higher levels of interference between work and personal life, and less
satisfaction with one’s work–life balance may be the consequences. These effects may be even stronger when professionals work very short hours and try
to squeeze the requirements of a demanding professional job into a marginal
16

part-time schedule. Although we do account for a number of salient features
of professional work (e.g. overtime, time pressure and job control), the differences between professionals and non-professionals persist and may be due to
characteristics of professional work not fully depicted by our measures of work
demands and resources (e.g. intensity of client contact and amount of face time
required).
Contrary to our predictions, we did not find a significant moderating effect
for gender. Since women still shoulder the majority of household and care work
and often choose part-time jobs with the specific aim of reconciling work and
family, we expected women to be more SWFB than their male counterparts if
they work a reduced schedule. However, our findings did not reveal any differences between men and women, which is in accordance with a recent report
issued by Sándor (2011). Using data from the European Working Conditions
Survey, the report concludes that there are hardly any differences in satisfaction
with work–life balance between men and women working part-time. Nevertheless, the findings of our study corroborate recent research on part-time employment that acknowledges differences in part-time schedules and diversity among
part-time employees (Beham et al., 2011; Martin and Sinclair, 2007; Wittmer
and Martin, 2011a,b).

Limitations and future research suggestions
Some limitations of this study should be kept in mind when interpreting the
results. The design of the study was cross-sectional in all countries and all variables were self-reported by the study participants. Such a design does not allow
for final causal conclusions and may be subject to common method bias. Although our findings are largely consistent with the assumed causal relationships
outlined in the hypothesis section of this paper, rival explanations for significant
relationships cannot be ruled out (Spector, 2002; Stone-Romero and Rosopa,
2007). Furthermore, the sample comprises service sector employees in certain
industries, meaning that the results may not generalize to a larger population of
workers. Future studies will definitively benefit from longitudinal designs and
samples including a broader array of industries. In addition, our study does
not take into account how voluntary a part-time work arrangement is. Outcomes for part-time workers may vary depending on whether the employee has
opted for a part-time job voluntarily or was forced to work a reduced schedule
because no other work was available (e.g. Tilly, 1996). Although involuntary
part-time employment is at a very low level in The Netherlands, Germany, and
the United Kingdom and at a moderate level in Sweden and Portugal according
to official statistics (Buddelmeyer et al., 2005), future empirical research may
want to take this aspect of part-time work into consideration. In addition, future studies on part-time work and the work–family interface should give even
17

more depth to the issue of heterogeneity of part-time employment by including a more refined typology of part-time employees (e.g. the latest typology of
Wittmer and Martin, 2011b).

Practical implications
Our findings indicate that working less than 20 hours per week has a stronger impact on employees’ SWFB than a substantial part-time schedule of 20–34 hours
per week. This is particularly true for non-professional employees who are more
likely to perform routine tasks and for whom it is also easier to establish shorthour part-time positions. For professionals, who according to our results benefit less from reduced working hours, it is important to make their work–life
priorities and schedules transparent to the organization. Transparent routines
and procedures that facilitate an efficient flow of work when the part-time professional is off work need to be established between employees and employers
(Corwin et al., 2001). In addition, the work demands and workloads of professionals need to be reduced accordingly if part-time work is to exert its positive
impact on employee behavior (Lee et al., 2002) and SWFB.
However, organizations may be reluctant to offer marginal part-time jobs to
professional employees because a substantial reduction in working hours may
require a redesign of the job, a reallocation of tasks within the workgroup or
department, or hiring and training a new employee who takes over the ‘other
half of the job’. Employers confronted with requests for marginal part-time
employment from highly qualified, professional workers may consider job sharing
a viable option to deal with such requests.
Finally, we want to clearly emphasize that organizations need to implement
‘good’ part-time jobs for both professional and non-professional workers which
offer adequate pay, good working conditions and opportunities for advancement, and do not put them at a disadvantage compared to full-time employees.
Part-time work frequently entails an ‘occupational downgrading’, meaning that
employees change to lower level jobs when they switch from full-time to parttime work (Lyonette et al., 2010). After several years, these employees may be
‘trapped’ in these less qualified part-time jobs, and are perceived by their employers as having lost valuable human capital (Walters, 2005). Compared to the
USA, the European Union has issued various directives to improve the working conditions of part-time workers. These EU Directives are part of European
employment law and have been adopted by the member states. Satisfaction
with working conditions among part-time employees is similar to that among
full-time employees in the European Union, but there continue to be differences
in prospects for career advancement, task complexity and access to training
and development opportunities (Sándor, 2011) that need to be overcome in the
future.

Conclusions
Our study contributes to a new strand of research on part-time employment
by pointing out the different nature of part-time work and its consequences for
SWFB of both non-professional and professional employees. Furthermore, the
findings add to the work–family literature by extending mainly US-based knowledge on SWFB and part-time employment to European service sector workers.
Our results clearly demonstrate that research on part-time employment and the
work–family interface should take differences among part-time employees into
account. Likewise, human resource management professionals in organizations
should treat part-timers as a heterogeneous rather than a homogeneous group
of employees who differ in their experience of balancing work and non-work
responsibilities.
