Abstract

Previous research has linked children’s family instability, as measured by mother’s maritalcohabiting transitions, to increased risk of poverty, illness, and poorer developmental outcomes.
Family theories hypothesize that disruption of household routines and reduction in household
resources link family instability to poorer child well-being. Recent research reveals that maternal
partnership transitions represent a small fraction of the household instability children experience.
These other forms of household instability might also be consequential for child well-being. The
goal of this study is to determine whether household instability involving non-parental household
members in children’s households is associated with changes in children’s educational outcomes
using longitudinal data available in the 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP).
Preliminary results suggest household instability by siblings and non-nuclear members, and
residential instability predict higher likelihood of dropping out of high school, repeating grades
and decreased interest in school.

Previous research on family instability and child well-being shows that children’s exposure
to changes in family structure leads to detrimental outcomes such as lower school engagement,
lower educational attainment, externalizing behavior and negative relationships with teachers and
peers (Smith et al. 2017; McLanahan and Percheski 2008). Some of this association is likely related
to the fact that changes in family structure can lead to reduced resources available to children,
some may be because family instability contributes to stress and disrupts household discipline and
routine. However, almost all these studies focused merely on changes in maternal relationship
status when measuring family instability. Recent research demonstrates that a large proportion of
household instability children are exposed to come from household members other than parents
(Perkins 2017; Raley et al 2018). Therefore, focusing only on parental instability may lead to
underestimation of other types of household instability, which might be consequential for
children’s developmental outcomes.
Family instability research provides many reasons for us to hypothesize that instability
involving non-parent household members is related to children’s educational outcomes. Similar to
maternal union transitions, other forms of household composition changes, such as the birth of a
sibling, having a grandparent move in, or residential moves might also be sources of stress and
disruption. Having adults move out of the household may reduce the supervision and support the
children receive, while having people move into the household may draw existing household
members’ attention away from children. In addition, individuals moving out of households can be
viewed as a signal of household conflict or household crowding, either is negatively associated
with child well-being (Perkins 2018). Therefore, changes in household composition are disruptive
and potentially stressful experiences for children. If so, these non-parental changes might also be
detrimental for children’s educational performance.

The goal of this study is to investigate whether household instability is associated with
children’s educational performance. We are interested in whether all forms of household instability
are equally associated with children’s educational performance, or whether certain types of
instability are more prominent. This study intends to push beyond the prior literature by
recognizing and investigating the associations between various forms of household instability and
children’s educational outcomes.

Background
In the United States families matter for children’s development and well being. Society
sees biological parents as the ones primarily responsible for child care and upbringing. Generally,
we expect children to live with their biological parents and deviations from the arrangement make
it less likely that children will benefit from their parents’ resources. Many studies have shown a
connection between parental divorce, declines in the amount or resources available to children in
terms of both time and money, and lower educational attainment. Parental divorce may matter for
child well being not only because of the reduced resources available to children, but also because
the process of divorce contributes to stress and disrupts household routines.
Family instability, arising from parental divorce and new relationship formation, is
associated with poorer educational outcomes for children. Family Stress Theory explains this
association by arguing that family transitions create stress and disrupt routines. This can make
parenting more difficult and can hinder children's ability to do well in school. Many studies have
provided evidence to support this theory, often by linking the number of maternal marital or
cohabiting relationship transitions to child development. Studies of family instability usually count
a transition into a two-parent family the same as a transition out, despite the fact that the

3

experiences of these transitions is likely very different. When a child gains a stepparent, the
household will typically experience a gain in resources, more strongly resemble the ideal typical
family. A transition (back) into a single parent family is likely to involve a reduction in resources.
The only consistency is that both transitions might involve some stress and conflict, not just among
the adults but also adults and children.
Most research finds little evidence, however, that transitions out of a two-parent family are
worse for child outcomes than transitions in, providing a lot of support for the idea that family
stability and routine is important. A few studies, however, find some differences between the
effects instability due to divorce relative to remarriage. The lack of consistency across studies is
related to the fact that a relatively small proportion of children experience multiple disruptions.
A closer evaluation of household composition changes can provide insights about the
underlying dynamics of household resource and household routine changes as well as their
possible influences on child outcomes. Although prior research has established that parental
instability has a profound impact on child well-being (Fomby and Cherlin 2007), few studies have
examined to what extent instability caused by people other than parents matters. It s clear that
household instability remains an unaccounted factor in children’s developmental contexts (Perkins
2017). Whether all changes in household compositions are equally important or whether certain
types of changes are more important to children’s well-being than others remain unknown. To
address this gap, this study assesses whether household instability is associated with academic
performance among U.S. households with children. Specifically, we analyze whether household
instability is associated with children’s risk of repeating and grade and their interest in school, as
well as parent's educational expectations. Our measure of household instability incorporates
movements of all the household members, not just mothers and their partners.

Data and Method
This study uses nationally representative data from the 2008 panel of the Survey of Income
and Program Participation (SIPP). SIPP interviews respondents every four months for four years.
Each interview includes a repeated set of core questions and changing modules of topical questions.
Much of our analysis is based on data from wave 4 (conducted in late 2009) and wave 10
(conducted two years later) because information on children’s educational performance is
collected in these two waves. Analyses using data from Waves 4 and 10 are limited to 8265
children age 7 to 15 in Wave 4 who are also observed in Wave 10. In addition, we use data from
the core interviews in all waves to measure high school drop out. The sample for the analysis of
high school dropout is limited to 7372 cases who were age 15-17 at any point during the SIPP
panel and who were observed at least three waves.

Measures
Our first measure of educational performance is whether the child repeated a grade. The
primary caretaker for each child (or proxy) is asked whether the child has ever repeated any grades
or been held back for any reason. The same question was asked in Waves 4 and 10 and we expected
that all children who had a repeated a grade in Wave 4 would have still repeated a grade in Wave
10. But this is not the case, of 486 cases who reported repeating grades in Wave 4, 247 respondents
reported the child has not repeated any grades in Wave 10.
The second measure of educational performance is high school dropout. This outcome is
determined from two variables in the core survey: current enrollment and educational attainment.
We code individuals who are no longer enrolled but do not have a high school degree as drop outs.

5

Unlike the measure of grade repeating, the measure of dropping out is available in every SIPP
interview, or every four months for individuals observed in every wave.
In addition, we investigate two measures of children’s attitudes toward school. The first is
based on the primary caretaker’s response to a question about whether a statement that [child] is
interested in school work is not true, sometimes true, or often true. The second is based on a
question of whether the child likes school. These are available only in Waves 4 and 10. These
variables provide some insight into why household instability is associated with grade repeating
and dropping out.
Our primary independent variables measure household instability. For analyses of grade
repeating and attitudes toward school, the household instability measures indicate experiences
between Wave 4 and Wave 10. A set of four measures indicate whether any 1) parent 2) sibling or
3) other household member entered or left the household or 4) whether the child changed address.
These indicators are not mutually exclusive, although we investigated models with mutually
exclusive measures. That is, we had indicators of whether one experienced a parent change and a
sibling change, a parent change only, a parent change with an other change, etc. The pattern of
results suggested that these four indicators capture the relevant variation. In addition, we
constructed more detailed measures of household changes, separating out sibling births (i.e. a
sibling aged 0 enters the household) from adult siblings leaving the household and other sibling
changes. For our analysis of high school dropout, we use measures of household instability
between one wave and the wave previous to predict high school dropout before the following wave.
This approach is appropriate if we believe that household instability has immediate effects on
dropping out and it might. [But we should consider more cumulative measures of household
instability after PAA].

Another set of independent variables describe household structure, whether there are two,
one, or no parents, whether any other adults are in the household, and number of children in the
household. Our models include controls for child age, sex, race, parental education, and household
poverty status.
Table 1 presents information on the independent variables for the two analytical samples.
Table 2 presents distributions on the outcome variables overall and by each of the household
instability measures. Overall few children repeat a grade and most like school and are interested
in school work. A very small proportion of students drop out of high school before age 18. Children
that experience household instability tend to be more likely to have repeated a grade, to not like
school, to be uninterested in school work or to drop out of high school.

Results
Tables 3-6 present our analyses of grade repetition, high school dropout, school interest
and likes school respectively. Sibling change (other than infants arriving) is associated with
dropping out of high school (Table 4). Analyses in Table 6 show that sibling change is also
associated with reduced interest in school work. Non-nuclear change is associated with repeating
a grade and dropping out of high school. It is now, however, associated with students’ attitudes
toward school. Address changes are also associated with grade repetition and (before controlling
for household structure) the risk of dropping out of high school.
These analyses provide strong evidence that household instability, of siblings and nonnuclear household members, is associated with children's educational outcomes. We are surprised
to find that in none of our analyses so far do we find that parent change is associated with

7

educational outcomes, although being in a two-parent family is associated with a reduced risk of
dropping out.

Note that these descriptive statistics include some individuals not included in the multivariate
analysis because they are missing on the dependent variable or because they are observed in only
one wave and thus aren't included in the event-history analysis. Future drafts will refine this.
