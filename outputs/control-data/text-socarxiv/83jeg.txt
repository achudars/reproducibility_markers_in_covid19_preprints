Abstract
Whether behavioural economics has a fundamental influence on economics is debated by behavioural and heterodox economists as well as by methodologists and historians of economics. At
the core of this debate is the question whether behavioural economics is shaped by large-scale
content imports from psychology, or whether these transfers have been too selective to challenge
dominant approaches in economics. This study contributes to the debate in analysing a variety
of bibliographic data from the disciplinary boundary between economics and psychology. Two
datasets from the boundary of behavioural economics and psychology are compared to sets of
economic and psychology publications in quantifying the use of mathematics, the share of empirical contributions, the authors’ academic background, and their cross-citations via network
analysis. In contrast to proposals made by some methodologists and behavioural economists, the
statistical results confirm content transfers from psychology via behavioural economics only to a
limited extend. The observed level of interaction provides evidence for a selective import of specific
psychological findings by a small number of established investigators in behavioural economics.
These findings were then intensively debated as divergences from rationality within the growing,
but econ-centered community of behavioural economists.

1. Introduction
Behavioural economics is established as a central field of research in today’s economics. It
has not only become an important part of economic research and graduate teaching, but has also
influenced the public opinion about economics. This rising importance is emphasised by some
scholars speaking of a "behavioral revolution" (Berg, 2003). Its rise has led to a lively discussion

about the innovative potential of behavioural economics based on its supposedly deep-rooted
relation to psychology and on the influence on the development of economics.
Main advocates of a profound influence on the development of the whole discipline are the
leading behavioural economists themselves (Rabin 1998, Kahneman 2003a, Kahneman 2003b,
Camerer and Loewenstein 2004). For example, Camerer (1999) predicts "a healthy reunification of
psychology and economics" under the roof of behavioural economics (p. 10 577). Other researchers
are more sceptical and criticize behavioural economics as "neoclassical economics in disguise"
(Berg and Gigerenzer, 2010). Sharp criticism comes from heterodox economists, who consider it
"a means of defending orthodoxy" (Earl, 2010, p. 216) or "too solidly rooted in neoclassical theory
to escape from being false knowledge" (Lee, 2012, p. 343).
Historians and methodologists of economics take different perspectives in analysing the potential influence of behavioural economics. Building on Lakatos’ methodology of degenerative
and progressive research programs, Dow (2014) assesses that behavioural economics "falls short in
Lakatosian terms" (p. 39). Other scholars highlight the common roots of psychology and economics
in the late 19th and early 20th century (Bruni and Sugden 2007, Hands 2009, Thaler 2016). Sent
(2004) concludes: "Behavioral Economics: How Psychology Made Its (Limited) Way Back Into
Economics". David Colander interprets new sub-fields like behavioural economics as a sign of the
"Death of Neoclassical Economics" (Colander, 2000a) or the rise of "New Millenium Economics"
(Colander, 2000b).
Davis (2006) proposes an empirical criterion to evaluate the influence of new research programmes in economics. He argues that "fields with high levels of imported contents may be said
to be comparatively heterogeneous" (p. 7) and that "cross-boundary content transfers . . . [set] up
genuine competition between approaches" (p. 9). These competing approaches "may be said to
constitute genuinely different approaches in virtue of the different conceptual and theoretical foundations of different fields [they import]" (ibid). By this criterion, behavioural economics would
constitute such a competitor as it "receives its impetus from recent psychology" (ibid).
This idea serves as research hypothesis for the study presented here, as it is narrowed to
the concrete empirical claim of content imports from psychology to economics via behavioural
economics. This criterion is at the core of the statements mentioned above: a potential major
influence on the methodology of economics by behavioural economics requires large-scale content
imports from psychology. On the contrary, critics assert that the psychological contents transferred
by behavioural economics are in fact highly selective and that dominant approaches in economics

2

remain unchallenged.
It is the aim of this study to investigate the relation of behavioural economics to psychology
at the boundary of both disciplines with quantitative means in order to find tangible evidence
of the degree of interaction between the disciplines. This analysis is complementary to thorough
historical-methodological assessments as it yields new insights which help to discriminate between
different narratives about the relation between psychology and economics.
In summary, this study provides quantitative measures on the relation between economics
and psychology at the boundary of both disciplines. Differences between behavioural economics
articles, psychology publications from the boundary of the discipline, and random selections of
economics and psychology articles are investigated with respect to the use of mathematics, the
share of empirical contributions, the authors’ academic background, the proportion of references
to other contributions in economics and psychology and their cross-citation links.
Taking the evidence of the different quantifications together, the results suggest selective imports of psychological content via behavioural economics. Cross-disciplinary contributions from
psychologists have been centred on publications from a small number of behavioural economists
(e. g. Kahneman and Tversky) that bridged the boundary between the disciplines and became
part of the canon of behavioural economics.
This study introduces a number of quantifications and tools from bibliometrics, network analysis and computational social sciences, which scholars in the methodology and history of economics
have recently begun to explore (Aistleitner et al. 2015, Angrist et al. 2017, Claveau and Gingras
2016, Duarte and Giraud 2016, Fourcade et al. 2015, Gingras and Schinckus 2012, Glötzl and
Aigner 2015, Herfeld and Doehne 2017, Kapeller et al. 2016, Panhans and Singleton 2016).1
To date, very few studies have taken a bibliographic perspective on the influence of behavioural
economics: Laibson and Zeckhauser (1998) evaluate the impact of Amos Tversky on the emerging
field of behavioural economics. The authors use data from the Social Science Citation Index
to review Tversky’s most cited contributions in order to identify fertile areas for behavioural
economics research. While the article provides a thorough overview of the evolving discipline,
the citation analysis is limited to counting the number of citations per article. In the same spirit,
Heukelom (2007) provides quantitative evidence of the scientific importance of famous behavioural
economists by using plain Google search queries. Other studies that consider a larger number of
behavioural economics contributions are those by Berggren (2012) and Grossmann (2014).2 Both
studies investigate the extent of normative judgements with respect to paternalistic economic

3

policies in behavioural economics, in conducting a literature analysis on selections of behavioural
economics articles.
The study is organised as follows: the next section describes the data selection process. The
results are presented in section 3 and section 4 discusses the results, mentions limitations of the
quantitative approach and outlines potential future research.

2. Data Selection
To approach the research question by a citation analysis, it is necessary to identify articles at the
boundary of both disciplines. Since there is no common classification of articles in economics and
psychology, which could be used to identify behavioural economics contributions and psychological
articles at the boundary to economics at the same time, an indirect approach has been developed
based on citation-relations in the Web of Science database.3
In a first step, survey articles and reviews on the history of behavioural economics have been
searched for the most important contributions to the emerging discipline, as determined by the
reviews, see table 1.4 The article "Prospect Theory: An Analysis of Decision Under Risk" (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979), for example, was mentioned in 10 out of 11 reviews as fundamental
for the discipline and has been cited more than 14,000 times by August 2017. This selection,
thus, represents fundamental foundational articles that unambiguously belong to behavioural economics. In order to build a dataset at the disciplinary boundary from this selection, all articles
were collected that refer to at least two of the foundational articles and that were published in
very prestigious economics- or psychology journals in a period from 1974 to 2013.5 The journals
are listed in table 2.
TABLE 1 AND 2 ABOUT HERE
The resulting dataset consists of 122 articles published in economics journals and 130 articles
published in psychology journals.6 Since these publications refer to fundamental articles that deal
with topics like conceptions of decision under risk, which are relevant for psychology as well as
economics, they can be presumed to be at the boundary of both disciplines.
It should be noted at this point that the dataset is a selection of articles with specific properties
that allow to consider them as being relevant for the boundary of economics and psychology.
However, it is not claimed that they constitute the entire set of publications on topics relevant for
both disciplines.7 Given the difficulties in identifying articles of the relevant sub-disciplines within

4

economics and psychology simultaneously, the data selection based on citations to foundational
behavioural economics articles is, nonetheless, advantageous compared to other methods commonly
used in citation analysis.8 The indirect approach allows to model the boundary zone at the
edge of both disciplines in terms of articles that are related to each other, but published in
journals of different disciplines.9 Additionally, two random selections of articles from economics
and psychology journals have been collected.
In summary, four sets of articles are compared to understand the relation of behavioural economics to psychology: the behavioural economics set consists of 122 articles published in prestigious
general interest economics journals, relating to the foundational behavioural economics contributions mentioned above. Similarly, the psychology boundary set, for simplicity called economic
psychology, consists of 130 papers from prestigious psychology journals relating to the foundational behavioural economics articles. Random selections of similar size from the same journals
are used to reveal differences between behavioural economics and economics in general, and between psychology and the related psychology contributions at the disciplinary boundary: 120
economics articles and 121 psychology articles. These two sets represent common contributions in
both disciplines. The behavioural economics set represents the sub-discipline of behavioural economics. The economic psychology set is not a representative selection of psychology articles, but
shifted towards the boundary to economics. Considering this selection of psychology publications,
that is defined by a proximity to economics, allows to understand the properties of psychology
publications that are more likely to be recognised by (behavioural) economists.

3. Results
Mathematical and Empirical Modelling
One dimension that differentiates the articles of the different categories is the use of mathematical modelling and the relation to empirical data.10 This dimension is quantified in table 3.
Part (a) displays the number of articles that include a mathematical model: the ratio in the set
of randomly selected economics articles is slightly higher than in the set of behavioural economics
articles. In both sets, the majority of articles use mathematical models. In contrast, only a minority of contributions in psychology include mathematical equations. The differences between
both behavioural economics and economic psychology, and between the two psychology data sets
are significant, as shown by the pairwise χ2 -tests. Similar results can be observed, when the use
of mathematics is compared across theoretical articles as shown in table 3b.

5

TABLE 3 ABOUT HERE
The results with respect to the relation to empirical data (table 3c) show a similar pattern.
Within the set of behavioural economics contributions, a majority of articles is related to empirical
data, leading to a ratio that is only slightly different than that of the balanced economics set. The
behavioural economics contributions, however, are significantly less related to empirical data than
the publications in economic psychology.
These observations reveal that behavioural economics is methodologically similar to economics
in general with respect to the use of mathematical modelling and the relation to empirical data.
At the same time, behavioural economics is less related to empirical or experimental data than
its counterpart at the disciplinary boundary. Moreover, the economic psychology publications are
more concerned with analysing experimental data than psychology in general, but differ even more
with respect to the use of mathematical terminology.
Cross-Discipline Contributions and Citations
The openness of a discipline to content imports from other fields can be assessed by the portion
of articles that successfully bridge the gap between the disciplines. That concept is quantified in
this study in two ways:
First, a score is computed that captures the authors’ scientific background based on past publications associated to them listed in the Web of Science database. Such an indirect approach has
been chosen, as there is no comprehensive dataset available that would include the education of the
researchers under consideration, particularly with respect to earlier contributions. The academic
background of an author is defined as the number of publications in economics (psychology) minus
the number of articles in psychology (economics) divided by the total number of publications (the
ten first publications of an author are considered, publications in other than the two relevant
disciplines are excluded).11 As this score is computed on an individual author level, a weighted
average is calculated to construct an article-based score according to the following formula:
n

πk∗ = (πk + 1) ·

1 X
1
=
αi · (n + 1 − i) ·
2
n(n + 1)/2
i=1
|
{z
}
weighting

The normalised (inverted) paper score πk∗ ∈ [0, 1] and reflects the academic background of all
n authors of an article k. It is defined as the sum of all individual authors’ scores αi multiplied
with a weighting factor that takes the different number of authors per article into consideration
6

and the position of an researcher in the authors’ list: the individual score of the first author gets
the highest weight, the second author is weighted second-highest and so on.12 An article published
in a discipline that has been written solely by researchers from that field gets a value of 0.0. If
that article was written solely by researchers from the other discipline, it would get a value 1.0.
Values in between indicate collaboration between both disciplines.
Secondly, the ratio of the number of cross-discipline references divided by the within-discipline
references is calculated for each article.13 For the case of an economic article, this indicator has a
value of 0.0, if there are no references to psychology. It would take a value of 1.0, if there are an
equal number of citations to contributions from economics and psychology, and values larger than
1.0 in case that there are more cross-discipline citations than economic references in the paper.
FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE
Figure 1 provides summary statistics of the two indicators below the panel and shows their
development over time for the four sets of articles represented by dots of differing size, according
to an article’s paper score. Note that random noise has been added to each graph in order to
reduce over-plotting and that the y-axis is on a logarithmic scale to increase readability. Squared
brackets at the lower end of each plot show the amount of random variation of those articles that
have no cross-discipline references. Additionally, small grey lines at the right side of each plot
show the distribution of the cross-discipline references and help to reveal differences between the
sets.
As expected, the share of both cross-discipline references and multi-disciplinary contributions
in the sets displayed in the panels A and B are much higher than in the respective sets below.
Moreover, there are significant differences between the contributions in behavioural economics
and economic psychology. The smoothed trend line shows a decreasing ratio of cross-discipline
references for the behavioural economics set, starting from an average value of around 0.2 in the
1980s to only 0.05 after 2010. Noteworthy is that number of articles that include no references to
psychology at all is increasing over time. The articles written by Daniel Kahneman and/or Amos
Tversky are highlighted in orange and show no specific pattern in the behavioural economics set
with three contributions below and three above the trend line.
In contrast, the economic psychology articles refer more often to economics publications, if
the mean and median values are compared. This result could be expected as the articles in this
set are collected based on a proximity to economics. Notable is the lack of any significant trend
over time, indicating a constant interest in economics contributions. Similarly, there is a constant
7

non-interest in economics from psychology in general, as can be seen in panel D.
While economics also lacks significant interest in psychology, as measured by citations, there
is a positive time trend in the data in panel C, which is due to a number of publications that
refer to some psychology sources, starting from the year 2000. This increasing time trend could
be seen as a signal for the success of behavioural economics to raise some attention to findings
from psychology.
Comparing the summary statistics of the paper score variable, both economics and psychology
exhibit low values. While still on a low level, there is a notable difference in the median values of
behavioural economics and economic psychology. The significantly higher value of the behavioural
economics set is partly due to the contribution of very prominent psychologists like Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky who succeeded in contributing to the behavioural economic literature.
Conversely, the publications in economic psychology are to a higher degree composed by scholars
within the field than from outsiders.
Citation Network
The articles from behavioural economics and economic psychology are both from the boundary
of the disciplines and should be closely related to each other. Accordingly, their cross-citation
pattern could reveal the pathways of content transfer from psychology to economics. This is
displayed in the network visualisation in figure 2. It consists of 493 articles (nodes) that are
connected via 740 citation-relations (directed links).14 Nodes that have no connections to other
nodes in the network, i. e. the vast majority of economics and psychology articles in the data set,
have been removed. The nodes are coloured to represent the four sets and the Kahneman/Tversky
publications. Larger nodes stand for articles with a higher paper score. The colour of the links
reflects within- and cross-discipline references: for instance, a link connecting two behavioural
economics articles is displayed in red. Thick grey links signalize a cross-disciplinary relation from
a psychology contribution to economics or vice versa. The nodes are positioned according to
the Fruchterman-Reingold algorithm (Fruchterman and Reingold, 1991). This algorithm aims
to improve the readability of the graph by placing the nodes in a way to minimize the overlap
of links. Highly intertwined regions are central regions in the network with many connections
between nodes.
FIGURE 2 AND 3 ABOUT HERE
The network illustrates the high level of connectivity within the sets of behavioural economics
8

and economic psychology publications. The nodes within each set are closely related to one
another, while a few highly central articles (hubs) bridge the gap between the disciplines. The
network connections at the boundary of the disciplines are far from random and exhibit a smallworld architecture (Watts and Strogatz, 1998). It is worth noting that the Kahneman/Tversky
publications are central hubs in the network. This is also true for other articles with a high paper
score, as indicated by larger nodes in the centre of the network.
The relation between paper score and network centrality is further examined in figure 3. It
relates paper score and betweenness centrality, an indicator of network centrality that measures the
total number of shortest paths between pairs of nodes that pass through an article i (Freeman 1977,
Newman 2001). As in figure 1, the y-axis is on a logarithmic scale and additional random noise
helps to reduce overplotting. The size of the nodes corresponds to the number of cross-discipline
ingoing links (in-degree centrality).
As can be seen from the figure, there are in fact only a few articles that combine a high
betweenness centrality and a high cross-discipline in-degree centrality. The six articles with the
highest number of cross-discipline in-links are emphasised in the graph and summary statistics of
these publications are listed below the panel. These six articles constitute one percent of the data
set, but account for more than 40 % of the cross-discipline citations.
These articles are central in the citation network. All of them are published in economics
journals, five of them include a high share references from psychology and are written by psychologists or in multi-disciplinary collaboration. These articles clearly take an important position
in transferring concepts from psychology to economics. However, looking at the authors of these
contributions, it becomes clear that all of them are written by highly influential scholars of behavioural economics, in particular Daniel Kahneman, George Loewenstein, Paul Slovic and Amos
Tversky.
Hence, the network analysis provides evidence for a high level of interaction at the disciplinary
boundary, which is mainly driven by the exceptional importance of a limited number of bridging
articles from highly established scholars.

4. Discussion
In contrast to the hypothesis put forward by Davis (2006), the empirical results do not confirm
high levels of cross-boundary content transfers from a genuinely different field. Instead, the data
suggest that, while there is interaction at the boundary between economics and psychology, it is

9

mainly driven by selective imports through a few highly important articles.
The use of mathematical terminology and the relation to empirical data in behavioural economics is relatively similar to economics in general. This result points towards a continuation
of economic research methods in behavioural economics, rather than to an alternative methodology, focused around experimental studies. In comparison, almost three out of four articles from
the psychology contributions at the boundary to economics present empirical data, mostly from
experiments.
On the other hand, behavioural economics refers to a significantly higher degree to contributions from psychology than other parts of economics. However, the average share of cross-discipline
references in the data set dropped by a factor of four from 1980 to 2010, while this value stays
largely constant in the economic psychology set. This implies that behavioural economics links to
psychology have diminished over time, so that it has become more econ-centred.
Looking at the interactions at the boundary of the disciplines reveals that the content import
from psychology to behavioural economics is largely due to a small number of articles. These are
composed by a few highly established scholars with a multi-disciplinary background who could
successfully bridge the gap and transfer psychological findings to economics. In comparison to
the random selection of economics articles, these bridging behavioural economics articles refer
substantially to contributions from psychology.
Taken together, the quantitative evidence suggests selective imports of psychological findings by
a small number of established and highly cited behavioural economists in accordance with Camerer
(1999), who defines the aim of behavioural economics as "[finding] mathematical alternatives
with firm psychological foundations to rationality assumptions" (p. 10 577) and Rabin (1998), who
assesses that "some important psychological findings seem tractable and parsimonious enough
that we should begin the process of integrating them into economics" (p. 13). These findings were
then intensively debated as divergences from rationality within the growing, but econ-centered
community of behavioural economists (Heukelom, 2007).15
This study marks an example of a more evidence based meta-discussion about the scientific
impact of behavioural economics. In doing so, the study builds on a number of assumptions,
particularly with respect to the data selection, which are explained in section 2 and further detailed
in the notes. Consequently, the results should be empirically verified and openly discussed by
practitioners from the field and methodologists alike.16

Notes
1 This rise in quantitative approaches to the history of economics has led Beatrice Cherrier to raise the question
whether a quantitative turn is going on in the history of economics (Cherrier, 2015).
2 Berggren (2012) manually classifies 323 out of 8,000 top-economics articles, while Grossmann (2014) considers
94 articles in detail.
3 Using a more direct approach, e. g. based on JEL-classification, as it has been done by Grossmann (2014),
is not an option in the case under investigation, since JEL-codes are only available for economics articles (and
the coverage in economics itself is not very high, particularly for older contributions that might be particularly
important bridging articles of behavioural economics). Moreover, Cherrier (2017) points out that JEL-codes do not
remain stable and are subject of discussion themselves.
It is also not possible to build a dataset on plain keyword search, because of the different vocabulary used in
economics and psychology to describe similar concepts; consider two examples: (a.) prospect theory vs. lossaversion and mental accounting, (b.) learning and evolution vs. generalized reinforcement and replication by
fitness. Further examples are provided by Camerer (1999).
4 The historical reviews considered are: Angner and Loewenstein (2007), Beck (2014), Bruni and Sugden (2007),
Camerer (1999), Camerer and Loewenstein (2004), Heukelom (2014), Kahneman (2003b), Kahneman (2003a), Pesendorfer (2006), Rabin (1998) and Samson (2014).
Only those articles have been considered as foundational that are mentioned as fundamental to behavioural economics or an important sub-field of it in at least three reviews and that, on average, got at least 15 citations per
year.
5 Note the following typology of potential citation relationships: 1. Given that an article A cites usually more
than one article B, there could be an asymmetric A cites B relation between one A and several Bs. 2. Two cited
articles B1 and B2 can be related by a B1 and B2 are cited by A relation. 3. Each B can be related to more
than one A by an asymmetric B is cited by A relation. 4. Two citing articles A1 and A2 can be connected by
a symmetric A1 and A2 both cite B relation. Note that the inclusion criterion for the articles in the data set is
according to the following rule (based on 1.): an article A is considered, if it cites at least two articles Bi and Bj
from the list of foundational articles, and if it is published in a journal listed in table 2.
The minimal threshold of two references to foundational articles was chosen to reduce the noise due to strategical citations from articles that have nothing to do with topics relevant for behavioural economics or psychological
articles at the boundary to economics.
Field journals that were founded after the emergence of behavioural economics with the aim to host contributions in the field like the Journal of Economic Psychology, Psychology and Marketing or Journal of Behavioural
and Experimental Economics were not considered as the the focus is on more general interest journals.
6 This selection represents a trade-off: While it would have been possible to increase the number of articles by
considering more foundational articles or journals, or to choose a different threshold for the number of references
to foundational articles, it would have been hard to argue that datasets composed differently better represent
relevant at the disciplinary boundary. For example, loosening the references-threshold from two to one leads to
a larger, but also skewed dataset of 443 publications in economics and 753 in psychology. The additional articles
disproportionately often refer to the top foundational articles (Kahneman and Tversky, 1979) and (Tversky and
Kahneman, 1974), which indicates strategic citation behaviour to particularly highly cited articles. This is confirmed
by manual inspection of a selection of these additional articles. They do not appear to be as tightly related to
"behavioural" topics as the smaller dataset of 252 articles. The complete dataset including all variables is available
from the author upon request.
7 The whole idea of a strict boundary between (sub-)disciplines should not be taken to literate. Given the
dynamic evolution of scientific disciplines, see for example Angrist et al. (2017) or Claveau and Gingras (2016), one
should rather think of a transition from the core of one field to another. The boundary, as a metaphor, describes
this zone of more or less smooth transition. Having this in mind, the articles under consideration can be said to
come from the transitional zone between economics and psychology.
8 The plain classification of articles to the category a journal belongs to would not help us to identify subdisciplines. Keyword- or JEL-based classification are, as explained in footnote 3, also not applicable.
9 Robustness checks support the presumption that data selection procedure identifies relevant behavioural economics articles (More information on the robustness checks is available on request):
(a.) The share of references to most of the foundational articles is similar for both sets.

12

(b.) For the articles with JEL-classification: the majority (76 %) refers to "typical" behavioural economics categories
like "Design of Experiments", "Information, Knowledge, and Uncertainty" or "Intertemporal Choice".
10 To assess the use of mathematics and empirical data, for each article two simple binary variables are manually
assigned. If an article discusses a concept in mathematical terms, e. g. by a utility function, it was classified as
using mathematical modelling. If there is some relation to empirical data, e. g. the reference to an experiment,
it was labelled as an empirical paper. Information on both variables is not available in bibliographic databases,
but had to be inferred from the articles themselves. However, in a recent article, Angrist et al. (2017) present a
machine-learning approach to estimate whether an article is empirical or theoretical.
11 The following examples illustrates the approach: An author A published his first ten articles in economics and
= 1.0. Another author B published 6 articles in economics journals and 4 in psychology - her
gets a score of 10−0
10
=
0.2. A third author C published eight articles in total, all in psychology journals and would
score would be 6−4
10
end with a score of 0−8
= −1.0. Please note that, when aggregated on an article level, the score is normalized on
8
a scale between 0 and 1. An article published in an economics journal written by e. g. one psychologist (αi = −1,
first author) and one economist (αj = +1, second author) would then have a paper score of πk∗ = 31 . Moreover, the
scale is inverted to ease the interpretation.
12 This design of the paper score gives most weight to the first author. As a robustness check, other weighting
schemes ( a. plain average of all authors individual scores and b. just the first authors’ individual score) have been
computed: the results are robust against such variation.
13 To construct measures of cross-disciplinary references, common journal rankings, which categorise journals into
disciplines, have been considered. Such journal-lists (see SCI 2014) are the basis for classifying the references of
an article into either economics or psychology publications. In the references of each article in the database, the
journals are specified by abbreviations (see http://bit.ly/WoS_abbr). Combining the journal ranking and the
abbreviation list, in total 202 economics journals and 231 psychology journals could be identified. References that
link to articles from other disciplines or non-journal publications were not considered to keep the data processing
feasible. For details on the construction of a network structure see footnote 14.
14 The network was constructed by creating an identifier of the form "last name of first author" + "initials
of other names of first author", "publication year", "journal abbreviation", "V" + "volume", "P" +
"first page of the article", for each article in the dataset (this is the identifier used by Web of Science to relate
articles to each other, e. g. "HARRIS JR, 1970, AM ECON REV, V60, P126"). The identifiers can be used to build
the network from the column "references" which is available in the bibliographic database.
15 Heukelom (2007) writes on page 41: "Kahneman, Tversky, and Thaler propose a research agenda that sets
economics off in a different direction, but at the same time saves traditional economics as the objective anchor by
which to stay on course".
16 Further research is necessary to test the empirical claims made in this study: such research could explore, for
example, other methods to identify potentially interdisciplinary sub-disciplines within economics, as the citationbased method presented here sensibly relies on assumptions, e. g. in the composition of the foundational articles
set. The inference of an author’s academic background and the share of interdisciplinary references could be
extracted algorithmically. Following research machine-learning approaches (Angrist et al., 2017), additional data
could be generated by the application of statistical learning approaches (e. g. by using text mining to infer the use
