Abstract

Entrepreneurial motivation is important to the process of economic growth. However,
evidence on the motivations of innovative entrepreneurs, and how those motivations differ
across fundamental characteristics, remains scant. We conduct three interrelated field experiments with the MIT Inclusive Innovation Challenge to study how innovative entrepreneurs
respond to messages of money and social impact, and how this varies across gender and
culture. We find consistent evidence that women and individuals located in more altruistic
cultures are more motivated by social impact messages than money, while men and those in
less altruistic cultures are more motivated by money than social impact. The estimates are
not driven by differences in the type of company, its size, or other observable characteristics, but instead appear to come from differences in the underlying motivations of innovative
entrepreneurs themselves.

Introduction

Innovative entrepreneurs are central to the process of economic growth. They create companies
that produce novel products and services which in turn increase productivity and aggregate
well-being.1 However, there is limited evidence on what motivates innovative entrepreneurs
to participate in this process. While economic theory has almost solely focused on the profit
motive (Schumpeter, 1942; Romer, 1990; Aghion and Howitt, 1992), stories about the motives of
successful entrepreneurs often focus instead on the importance of social impact.2 In fact, the role
of pro-social motivations in economic activity has been gaining increasing relevance in research
(Cassar and Meier, 2018) and in the media.3 Moreover, there is also a recognition that there
are ample differences in the salience of such motivations across fundamental dimensions, such
as gender and culture (Croson and Gneezy, 2009; Falk et al., 2018). What motivates innovative
entrepreneurs? To what extent do pro-social and profit motivations matter? And how does their
relative importance vary across gender and culture?
In this paper, we present large sample evidence from a set of three, pre-registered, interrelated
experiments to assess what motivates innovative entrepreneurs, and how their motivations differ
across gender and culture. Working with the MIT Inclusive Innovation Challenge (MIT IIC)—
a premier competition focused on helping innovative entrepreneurs—we perform randomized
messaging experiments encouraging individuals to learn more or apply to the competition. The
sample includes more than 14,000 entrepreneurs, pulled from the MIT IIC, AngelList, and from
Dunn and Bradstreet. We send each individual a randomly assigned social impact message,
money message, or neutral technology-focused message, and interpret their response as evidence
on the motivations of innovative entrepreneurs themselves. Following our pre-registration, we
focus particularly on relative differences across culture and gender. For all our outcomes, which
range from privately clicking on emails or websites to learn more about the competition, to
submitting a detailed and time costly application, our results document large and heterogeneous
1

Consistent with the literature, we consider a broad definition of innovation (e.g., spans much beyond ’inventors’).
However, only a small portion of entrepreneurship is in fact innovative and has the potential to significantly
improve well-being and productivity. See Guzman and Stern (2016) for evidence on skewness in the innovative
potential of startups, and Catalini et al. (2019) for an in-depth discussion of the relative importance of innovative
entrepreneurship in realized startup growth vis-á-vis other processes (e.g., random growth).

differences in the motivations of innovative entrepreneurs. We find that women and individuals
located in more altruistic cultures are more motivated by social impact messages than money,
while men and those in less altruistic cultures are more motivated by money than social impact.
These differential responses appear to mostly be driven by different responses to the social
message, as there is little difference in responses to the money message and neutral technology
message. Together, these findings constitute novel insights into the motivations of innovative
entrepreneurs, and expand existing research in at least three directions.
First, by studying innovative entrepreneurs, we move beyond the self-employed, which has
been the focus of the bulk of prior work on entrepreneurial motivations (Hamilton, 2000; Hurst
and Pugsley, 2011). It is important to underline that innovative entrepreneurs represent only
a small fraction of new firms (Schoar, 2010; Guzman and Stern, 2016), and entrepreneurial
motivations vary by growth intentions (Cassar, 2007). The psychological traits of innovative
entrepreneurs also appear to be distinct from other groups (Kerr et al., 2019). Hence, it is questionable whether results from the self-employed translate directly to ‘growth oriented’ innovative
entrepreneurs. We are, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to provide direct evidence
on the motivations of innovative entrepreneurs who are pivotal to the growth process.
Second, we expand the set of entrepreneurial motivations under consideration by going beyond the profit motive. Even though there is a booming interest in the economics literature
on the ‘non-pecuniary’ incentives of work (such as the meaning of work (Cassar and Meier,
2018)), the dominant paradigm of innovation and entrepreneurship continues to rely on a model
of profit goals leading to investment, innovation, and growth. One exception to this could be
the literature on ‘social enterprises’, where social impact has been documented as an important
entrepreneurial motive (e.g., Dacin et al., 2011; Ganguli et al., 2019; Hockerts, 2017). Our results have implications for this literature by bringing in the role of gender and culture. We also
contribute to this literature by expanding the role of social impact into the domain of innovative
entrepreneurs, who are unique actors in the process of economic growth.
Third, our study also provides novel evidence on entrepreneurial motivations by focusing on
(pre-registered) fundamental dimensions of heterogeneity, namely culture and gender.4 Prior
4

Empirical evidence also documents important differences in preferences across these dimensions in the general
population. Croson and Gneezy (2009) review a large number of experimental studies documenting women
have higher pro-social preferences, risk-aversion, and inequality aversion. Similar variation exists across culture:
Falk et al. (2018) report wide differences in economic preferences across culture, including time preference, risk
preference, and altruism. We believe that such systematic differences would also manifest in the motivations of
innovative entrepreneurs, and hence choose to focus on them directly.

3

studies, in an effort to have a more homogeneous sample, have often focused on males residing
in the United States (e.g. Hamilton, 2000). Additionally, while one strand of the literature documents a ‘gender gap’ in entrepreneurship (Bapna and Ganco, 2018; Howell and Nanda, 2019;
Kanze et al., 2018; Ewens and Townsend, 2018; Brooks et al., 2014; Ding et al., 2013; Guzman
and Kacperczyk, 2019; Lee and Huang, 2018), this work often makes the implicit assumption
that motivations themselves are not different across genders. This assumption has implications
for both the theoretical and the econometric approach adopted. Our results provide nuance to
these studies, expanding on the important role of culture and demographics in entrepreneurship,
which can have broad implications for policy and business strategy. Our results also complement previous studies by providing a better picture of how institutional constraints, messaging,
identity, and motivations can lead to “missing entrepreneurs” who might slip through the cracks
in the process of innovation.
Empirically, our results also join a growing set of studies using experiments to understand
entrepreneurship (Camerer and Lovallo, 1999; Bapna, 2017; Chatterji et al., 2019; Astebro and
Hoos, 2016; Ganguli et al., 2019; Lee and Huang, 2018; Boudreau and Lakhani, 2016). One
paper close to ours in this set is Ganguli et al. (2019), who study similar social and money
messages across 431 ‘nascent social entrepreneurs’ — those who have not paid any salaries
or wages or have not had positive operating revenue in the past three months — in the UK.
While they focus on the main effects of different messages on firm outcomes, our study focuses
on heterogeneous effects on a small set of pre-registered outcomes with the goal of specifically
capturing motivations, using a larger sample of more than 14,000 entrepreneurs connected to the
innovation process. In areas of overlap, however, their results and ours are roughly consistent.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes our empirical setting,
the MIT Inclusive Innovation Challenge. Section 3 provides details on the experimental design.
Section 4 presents the results of our three experiments. Section 5 concludes.

Empirical Setting: The MIT Inclusive Innovation Challenge

The MIT Inclusive Innovation Challenge (MIT IIC) is a premier global competition run within
MIT to help innovation-driven entrepreneurs who are using technology to generate economic
opportunity. As Erik Brynjolfsson, the co-founder of the IIC put it, the IIC’s motto is “It’s not
what technology does to us, it’s what we do with technology.” Thus, the mission of the IIC is

4

“to accelerate the success of the changemaking entrepreneurs”. Since its launch in 2016, the IIC
has generated much economic and social impact itself: the IIC’s impact report states that IIC
winners currently operate in 43 countries, so far generating $180 million in revenue and more
than 6,800 jobs (IIC, 2019). Screenshots of the IIC’s mission statement and impact report are
included in the Appendix (Figure A1).
The global scale and diversity of the IIC makes it an attractive setting to study the motivations of entrepreneurs across culture and gender. In contrast to many other business-plan
competitions across universities (including at MIT), the MIT IIC does not focus on companies
that are student- or alumni-led or affiliated with MIT in other ways. Rather, the IIC seeks
to select early-stage startups beyond the “idea phase” with an innovative component and the
potential to grow, independent of any affiliation. The IIC also attracts its fair share of women
entrepreneurs, in that 41% of IIC winners are startups with a woman leader or executive (IIC,
2019). In addition, the IIC works with organizations across five continents to recruit innovative
entrepreneurs from more than 150 countries to date, providing us an opportunity to observe a
culturally diverse pool of innovative entrepreneurs.
The MIT IIC provides various types of support to its entrepreneurs, including feedback given
by judges to all companies that submit an application, large cash prizes that winning companies
can use to scale and grow (which total more than $1 million annually across all winners), and
public recognition at regional and global events for those who win the challenge. To select the
IIC winners, expert judges in each region evaluate applications to select 60 companies that will
proceed to regional pitch events. 20 regional winners are awarded at these events, who then
proceed to the global pitch event where four global winners are announced. Winners in recent
years reflect the broad range of innovative entrepreneurship that the MIT IIC focuses on, from
AdmitHub, which developed an AI-based messaging tool to help students excel in college, to
ftcash, an Indian venture empowering micro-merchants through loans using digital payments.
Because finding innovative startups and encouraging them to apply is no easy task, the MIT
IIC devotes substantial effort and resources to marketing and outreach, including a professional
website, email marketing campaigns, and outreach events with local partners to encourage companies to apply. We engaged with the IIC in May 2018 and partnered with them for their 2019
competition (which began the following March), by supporting their outreach effort through
email campaigns. Our study thus focuses on outreach activities in the time leading up to the

5

MIT IIC application deadline.
The application process consists of two stages: a registration stage and an application stage.
The registration stage asked interested individuals to perform the small task of registering for the
MIT IIC by May 9th. This required creating a user account and filling out a short form, which
we estimate takes about 5 minutes. The application stage then asked registrants to submit
a full application. The application form was composed of sixteen long-form questions that
together amounted to a short business plan 5 , which formed the basis upon which applicants were
evaluated in the first round. We estimate that this process of filling out the complete application
form would take at least two hours for most applicants. All the teams who had registered but
not yet submitted an application had two more weeks after the registration deadline, till May
23rd, to do so.

Experimental Design

As described in our pre-registration, our experiments sent entrepreneurs email messages encouraging them to apply to the MIT IIC. We emphasized one of three narratives in each of the
randomized messages: the opportunity for social impact through the IIC (the social condition),
the potential monetary benefits of participating in the IIC (the money condition), or simply
the possibility of winning the competition, with an emphasis on technology and innovation (the
neutral technology condition). We emailed them in three experiments using four distinct samples. We then assessed responses to each of these three messages across gender and culture. We
interpret differences in the estimated rate of response as evidence of differences in the underlying
motivations of entrepreneurs themselves.
Our main messages were the following in the email subject and body for each condition, with
only slight variations otherwise.6
• Social condition
– Subject: Create Greater Shared Prosperity. Register Today for the MIT IIC!

The application questions covered the company’s vision, strategy, impact, competitive advantage, risks, and
others. All questions are available at https://www.mitinclusiveinnovation.com/the-challenge/#toc-application.

Templates for all experiments are provided in the Appendix (Figures A2 - A6). In the design of the emails,
we particularly focused on emphasizing different incentives for applying to the IIC while keeping constant any
other characteristics, such as template design, general length, general information about the IIC, and links to the
website for more information.

Sample Selection and Randomization
Registration Email Experiment

Our first experiment (the ‘registration email experiment’) pools together two lists of email addresses, the MIT IIC mailing list and a list of contacts purchased from Dunn and Bradstreet
(D&B). The MIT IIC mailing list contains 9,156 contacts after initial cleaning to remove IIC
affiliates, prior winners, and other non-entrepreneur groups. These contacts represent a reasonable set of potential applicants who opted to receive updates on the competition. We appended
to this list 3,633 contacts purchased from D&B that we considered mapped to our definition of
innovative entrepreneurs. Specifically, building from Guzman and Stern (2016) on the idea that
founding choices can represent innovation and growth intent, we developed a stringent criteria
that we think captures reasonably well individuals who are leading young firms built around
novel ideas that have the potential to increase economic productivity and well-being (i.e., innovative entrepreneurs).We included all contacts available in the D&B database that (1) are for
profit corporations (in the spirit of Guzman and Stern (2016)) (2) were founded between 2014
and 2019, (3) had between 2 and 50 employees, (4) had a yearly revenue of less than $2 million,
(5) had a web address, and either of (6a) had as the contact the most senior member of the firm
whose job title was either founder, president, CEO, COO and is in a ‘high tech’ industry—which
are (i) Manufacturing, (ii) Information Services, and (iii) Professional, Scientific, and Technical
Services, or (6b) the contact has the title of CTO or CIO.
7

We admittedly used our discretion

In the Appendix Table A9, we present a series of robustness tests relaxing criteria (1) to include partnerships
and not-for-profits, and criteria (6a) to include all industries rather than only these ‘high-tech’. We also present

7

to determine these criteria, but we see several advantages to appending this D&B list to the
MIT IIC contacts for our experiment. In particular, doing so provides us with more variation
in geographic coverage (the MIT IIC list is much more international than D&B), increases the
external validity of our estimates to allow for entrepreneurs that are not tied to the IIC, and
increases statistical power of our analysis.
For each sample, we randomly assigned individuals to one of the three conditions – social,
money, and neutral – using the complete randomization procedure. Table A1(a) and (b) show
the summary statistics of pre-treatment observables for the IIC and D&B sample respectively,
and the estimated p-values of two-sided t-tests between observations in each treatment arm.
We present balance tests of each sample independently because the pre-treatment observables
available to us (and hence the variables on which we test for balance) were different. Table A1(a)
shows that the MIT IIC mailing list sample is balanced on the main pre-treatment covariates
available to us: gender, age, whether they are in the US, whether they have clicked or opened a
prior MIT IIC email, and whether they have previously applied or registered with the IIC. Each
treatment group was approximately 33% female, and 66% from the U.S. Table A1(b) shows the
D&B sample is also balanced on a number of pre-treatment covariates: gender, altruism, job
title of CTO or CIO, company revenue, number of employees, whether they are located in the
biggest state in the sample (California), and major industries.

Registration AngelList Experiment

Our second experiment (the ‘registration AngelList experiment’) consists of AngelList newsletter recipients who clicked on the “Learn More” link. AngelList entrepreneurs represent the
quintessential growth-oriented founders commonly studied in research, and there is a growing stream of studies using this sample for this reason (e.g., Bernstein et al., 2017; Ewens and
Townsend, 2018). On May 2nd, AngelList emailed all subscribers its weekly newsletter, in which
it included an announcement about the MIT IIC with a link we had provided to them (Figure
A3). We configured a special server at the destination of the URL that randomly showed a
version of the IIC website mimicking one of three messages we emailed. Once individuals clicked
on any of the links on this landing page, they were directed to the main website and continued
results using either criteria (6a) or (6b) separately as well as results using the IIC mailing list only. Our results
remain unchanged.
8
Table A1(c) shows that the treatment groups are also well balanced in the extended D&B sample, which includes
all industries as well as partnerships and not-for-profits.

their visit as a normal IIC website visitor.9 The newsletter resulted in more than 1,196 participants landing on our server. Table A1(d) shows that the samples are balanced on observable
measures, including location, days between receiving the email and clicking, and device used.
Due to the nature of the data, we could not observe visitor gender.

3.1.3

Application Experiment

The final experiment (the ‘application experiment’) occurred after the registration stage closed
on May 9th, when registrants had two weeks to submit a full application. On May 10th, we
sampled all individuals who had already registered but had not yet submitted an application.
10

We selected the 802 individuals that met two criteria. First, we required that the individuals

did not overlap with our first experiment to avoid contamination across messages.11 Second,
to guarantee that our analysis would be able to solicit the motivations of actual entrepreneurs,
we focused only on individuals who designated themselves as CEOs of their company in the
registration form (which was asked explicitly). We used complete randomization to assign these
subjects to one of the three treatment groups, social, money, or neutral. Table A1(e) shows
that the groups are well balanced with respect to pre-treatment observables including gender,
altruism, the region in which they registered, the percentage of the application completed at the
time of the first email, award category, for-profit vs. non-profit, number of female employees,
and revenue. We sent three waves of emails with slightly varied messages encouraging registrants
to apply, two to four days apart during the two weeks leading up to the application deadline.

3.2

Variable Definitions and Summary Statistics

3.2.1

Independent Variables

We define Female as a binary variable equal to one if a subject’s gender is female, and zero
if male. We determine the gender of participants as predicted by the online marketing tool or
from their first name and country using an online API.
We measure culture by taking advantage of the recent work by Falk et al. (2018) that
9

Due to the nature of the online experiment, we could not randomize visitors ex-ante.
A total of 1,889 individuals registered by the registration deadline of May 9th, 2019. Reflecting the global nature
of the competition, 662 of the registrants were in Africa, 382 in Asia, 208 in Europe, 332 in Latin America, and
305 in the US or Canada.
11
It is important to note that the IIC uses a variety of marketing approaches beyond our emails, offline and online.
The majority of registrants came from these other channels, giving us a sizable sample non-overlapping with our
registration stage experiments.
10

9

systematically measures global economic preferences along various dimensions across the world.
The data includes nationally representative samples from more than 70 countries who are asked
survey questions that relate to economic preferences. We focus on the variable Altruism, which
captures the pro-social preferences we seek to measure in our experiment. Altruism is measured
by Falk et al. (2018) using two survey items related to donation decisions. On the suggestions
of these authors, we aggregate this measure at the U.S. state level by using population weights
in the disaggregated data, which provides us with U.S. variation.12 For each participant, we
match this measure to their location based on their IP address (except for the D&B sample, for
which company location is provided by D&B). We drop a small number of participants in the
altruism regressions whose location could not be identified.

3.2.2

Outcomes

Based on data availability and experiment design, we estimate entrepreneurs’ interest in our
messages through five outcome measures. In the registration email experiment, we use two
outcome measures that capture revealed interest from responses to treatment messages, both
directly in the email and on the website. Total Clicks, our preferred outcome, represents the
total number of times a subject clicks on any of the links on the email or IIC website within
the first 72 hours after sending the email. Website Clicks represents the total number of clicks
on the website alone, within the first 72 hours. In the registration AngelList experiment, we
only randomize between those that actually arrive at our website, and hence focus on the time
spent on the website as a measure of interest in the IIC. We define two outcome variables. Time
Spent (first visit) represents the duration of a subject’s first visit to the website (in seconds), and
Time Spent (all visits) is the sum of time spent across all visits within 72 hours of receiving the
email. We collected data by tracking each visit on our server and on Google Analytics. Finally,
in the application experiment, we measure whether a registrant actually applies to the MIT IIC.
We define Has Applied as a binary variable that equals one if a registrant has submitted their
application by the application deadline of May 23rd, and zero otherwise. Table 1 presents the
summary statistics of each of these variables.

Results

We now proceed to the centerpiece of our analysis: the differential effects of money and social
messages in each of our experiments on motivating entrepreneurs’ interest in the MIT Inclusive
Innovation Challenge. We analyze each experiment in turn.

4.1

Registration Email Experiment

For our registration email experiment, we report the estimated coefficients of Poisson regressions
on the count of clicks in Table 2. Columns (1) and (2) report differences in Total Clicks, which
is our preferred outcome, while Columns (3) and (4) report differences in Website Clicks. The
excluded category is the social message. Finally, we cluster standard errors by country to account
for the possibility of within country correlation. Throughout the text, we often translate the
coefficient to incidence rate ratio (IRR) for interpretability.
Column (1) reports the variation in Total Clicks for each treatment condition and gender.
Our focus is the relative response of men or women to the money message, compared to social.
We estimate a positive coefficient of 0.435 for Money, suggesting that men respond more to the
money message by 54.5% with clicks compared to social messages on average (p = 0.002)13 .
This effect goes in the opposite direction when we consider women. The interaction of Female
and Money has a coefficient of -0.812 that is highly statistically significant. This reflects a net
response of -0.377 for women once the main effect is added (p = 0.03); that is, women respond
with 31.4% fewer clicks to the money message compared to the social message. We see the same
qualitative effects across gender with the neutral message, albeit with slightly smaller effect
sizes. The coefficient of 0.172 for Neutral implies that for men, the incidence rate of total clicks
increases by 18.7% in the neutral condition vis-a-vis the social (p = 0.095). For women, however,
the rate of total clicks decreases by 24.9% (p = 0.09). We also display the aggregate effects in
Figure 1 for ease of interpretation.
These estimates indicate striking differences in the responses of men and women to money
and social messages, as revealed through their clicks. Women respond more to social messages
and less to money messages, while men respond in the opposite way.14 This difference between
13
14

The implied incidence rate ratio is 1.545, estimated as exp(0.435) = 1.545.
This also shows on the extensive margin when we look at the probability of any click as opposed to the number
of clicks. In the Appendix Figure A7, we plot the raw probability of any clicks by gender across the money and
social treatment to see a similar pattern. Moreover, in column (1) of Table A7, we find qualitatively similar
results when we use the probability of clicking as the outcome variable in the regression.

11

men and women appear to be most strongly driven by their different (and opposing) responses
to the social message than the money or neutral message. In particular, women do not seem
to treat the money message significantly differently from the neutral condition (statistically
and economically). Men seem to slightly prefer money incentives over the neutral technology
condition, but this effect is not statistically significant at conventional levels.
Column (2) reports differences in responses across culture, captured by our altruism measure,
to the experimental conditions. The results show some interesting parallels with the gender
results. The coefficient for Money is positive and significant, with a value of 0.494 (p = 0.001),
suggesting our subjects on average respond more to the money message than the social message,
but the interaction of Altruism and Money is negative and significant, with a coefficient of 2.190 (p < 0.001). Interpreting this within our data suggests that a subject that moves from
the 10th percentile of altruism to the 90th percentile of altruism moves from an estimated 67%
higher relative risk of clicks to the money incentive (compared to the social message), to a 59.8%
lower risk of clicks (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). The pattern is similar with the
neutral technology condition, though the estimates are less precise and are not significant at
conventional levels. The coefficient for the interaction of Altruism and Neutral suggests that,
on average, our subjects are less likely to click on the neutral message the higher the level of
altruism.15

16

The altruism results seem analogous to the gender estimates earlier. We find significant and
systematic heterogeneity, where individuals in less altruistic countries respond to the money condition more than social, and those in more altruistic countries show an opposite effect. Moreover,
the differences appear to be driven by a differential response to the social condition across cultures. Overall, these estimates suggest that it is important to have a broader conceptualization
of the motivations of innovative entrepreneurs that focuses on other motivations beyond profit,
and that accounts for fundamental dimensions of heterogeneity such as gender and culture.

4.1.1

Robustness Tests and Validations

We now consider a few robustness and validation checks to ensure that our measures adequately
capture both motivations and their heterogeneity. First, we ask whether clicks can actually
15

Again, we find qualitatively similar results when we use the probability of clicking as the outcome variable in
column (2) of Table A7.
16
As an additional check, we control for altruism in the gender regressions and for gender in the altruism regressions
in Table A5 in the Appendix. We find the results to be qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the baseline
estimates described here.

12

be used as strong enough proxies for the motivations of entrepreneurs to engage in business
activity. For instance, there might be a concern that the entrepreneurs’ true motivation for
social incentives could be short-lived, or that it could simply reflect other elements of their
personal identity beyond being an entrepreneur. In Table 3, we carry out an exercise similar to
Bapna and Ganco (2018) and consider whether total clicks and email clicks in our data actually
predict registration.17 To do so, we estimate Logit regressions with the dependent variable being
a binary indicator of whether a participant has registered by the registration deadline, and the
independent variable the individual response in clicks on the email, the website, or both. Column
(1) shows a coefficient of 0.201 for total clicks, implying that an additional click on either the
email or website is associated with a 22% increase in the likelihood to register. Column (2)
shows a similarly high coefficient for website clicks. An additional click on an email is correlated
with a 25% higher likelihood of registering. Finally, Column (3) shows the highly significant
relationship between number of email clicks and registration with a similar magnitude. We
interpret these results as strong evidence that individuals’ responses to emails are reflective of
their underlying entrepreneurial motivations.
Next, we consider the validity of our measure of altruism within its broader economic context.
Given that altruism is measured at the regional level, one potential concern is that altruism
is correlated with other regional characteristics such as economic conditions and institutional
constraints, which in turn affect entrepreneurs’ funding availability and needs. In Table A2, we
investigate a number of country-level characteristics using data from the World Bank’s World
Development Indicators such as GDP per capita, which would be a proxy for overall levels of
development, and consider how they relate to our measure of altruism.18 The estimates from
bivariate OLS regressions show that altruism is not correlated in a statistically or economically
significant way with any of the World Bank measures we include: female education, log(GDP
per capita), Gini coefficient, labor force participation, and log(health expenditure per capita).19
17

We are unable to address this concern directly due to registrations being sparse throughout our mailing lists. It
is important to keep in mind that the MIT IIC has a large outreach program with regional partners across the
world, well beyond the mailing lists we have access to.
18
We also present additional robustness checks in Table A6 of the Appendix to show that all our results (across
experiments) are robust to controlling for GDP per capita.
19
We also use ‘(positive) reciprocity’ as an alternative measure of culture to ensure robustness of our results in
columns (3)-(8) of Table A7 in the Appendix. Falk et al. (2018) use two measures to arrive at an estimate of
reciprocity based on the willingness of individuals to return a favor. While not a perfect proxy, this measure of
‘pro-sociality’ in culture could be related to the sense of giving back to society. It has a correlation coefficient of
0.7 with the altruism measure. The results are qualitatively similar while quantitatively slightly smaller relative
to the altruism measure. This is in line with our logic of using the altruism measure which might capture the
culture of ‘creating shared prosperity’ better.

13

Finally, in Table A8, we show how male and female entrepreneurs are not systematically different
in their relevant observables across samples which provides additional credibility to our findings.
4.2

Registration AngelList Experiment

We report the results of our registration AngelList experiment in Table 4. Columns (1) and
(2) report differences in the response rate of individuals in our AngelList experiment. These
regressions report OLS estimates of the time spent during the first visit (Column (1)) and across
all visits (Column (2)). We focus on all visits as our preferred outcome but highlight the fact
that the main results are qualitatively the same across columns. Consistent with the results of
our registration email experiment, we observe a positive coefficient for the money message, but
a negative and significant coefficient for the interaction of money and altruism. On average,
individuals who see the money message stay on the website 237 seconds longer across all visits
than those who see the social message. However, they spend 850 seconds less on the website
for each point increase in the level of altruism. Considering the same range of values as in the
registration email experiment (for comparability), an individual at the 10th percentile of altruism
would stay 244 seconds more on the website in response to the money message (compared to
the social message), while a person in the 90th percentile of altruism would remain 309 seconds
less in the money condition than the social condition. We see largely similar patterns for the
neutral condition vs. the social condition. While there was no statistically significant difference
at the 10th percentile of altruism (p = 0.4), an individual at the 90th percentile of altruism
was expected to spend 696 seconds less on the website in the neutral condition compared to the
social (p = 0.001).
These AngelList results replicates our baseline results with a highly relevant sample of entrepreneurs. We believe this consistency provides strong evidence of the validity of our results,
and, more generally, of the importance of heterogeneity in entrepreneurial motivations across
cultures.
4.3

Application Experiment

Finally, we move to the application stage experiment. As mentioned before, we randomize our
messages to companies who have incurred the low cost of registering but have yet to undertake
the time intensive task of filling out a lengthy application form and actually applying to the
IIC. Columns (3) and (4) of Table 4 report the results. The regressions are Logit models with
14

control variables from our balance table as controls in the regression specification to improve
precision of estimates.20

21

The results are remarkably similar to the registration experiments. Column (3) presents
results for gender. The coefficient for money is positive and significant, with a value of 0.676,
suggesting men are 96.5% more likely to apply under the money condition than the social
condition. However, the interaction of money and female is again negative and significant, with
a coefficient value of -0.954. That is, while men have a stronger response to the money message,
women are 24.3% less likely to respond to the money message compared to the social one. Once
again, we see similar results when comparing the neutral message to the social: men are 85%
more likely to apply in the neutral message, while women are 32.8% less likely.
Column (4) reports the treatment effects across culture. We estimate a positive coefficient
of 0.278 for the money message on average (p = 0.16) and a negative coefficient of -1.431 for the
interaction of altruism and money (p = 0.01). These coefficients imply that an entrepreneur in
the 10th percentile of altruism of our registration sample would be 33.7% more likely to apply
to the IIC (if registered) with the money message, while an entrepreneur in the 90th percentile
would be 47.3% more likely to do so with the social message. Comparing to the neutral message,
subjects on average were 37% more likely to apply when they received the neutral message than
the social message, and we see the same change in the direction of the effect as we increase in
altruism. The effect varies when we compare the 10th and 90th percentiles of altruism. Subjects
in less altruistic countries were 37.5% more likely to apply with the neutral message than the
social message, while those in more altruistic countries were 11.9% less likely to do so.22
These results are reassuring in that we find consistent evidence across all three experiments.
There exist consistent differences by gender and altruism in entrepreneurs’ responses across the
three experiments, even as we move to high cost activities and focus on the startup CEOs themselves. Furthermore, these results appear to be particularly driven by a differential response to
the social condition. The motives of ‘high growth’ innovative entrepreneurs seem more nuanced
and complex than existing theory allows.
20

These variables include Award Category, which is a categorical variable that indicates which of the four categories
a subject has registered, and For-profit, a binary variable that equals one if a registrant indicated her startup as a
for-profit organization. We also control for the Number of female employees in a subject’s organization, whether
the company serves marginalized populations and if they have any employees above the age of sixty.
21
For robustness, we test the effect using Probit and OLS regressions, as well as alternative measures for determining
whether the registrant is the CEO of the company. These results are reported in Tables A3 and A4.
22
Like in the previous analysis, we highlight how female and male CEOs were similar across many characteristics
as reported in Table A8.

15

4.4

Alternative Explanation

The randomization of the messaging, pre-registration of our heterogeneous treatment effects and
consistent results across the three experiments provide us confidence in our estimates. However,
we briefly discuss a potential alternative explanation of our results. One alternative explanation
of the gender differences is that innovative entrepreneurs could be engaging in sense-making and
behaving strategically. For example, women entrepreneurs might respond more to the social
message because they want to signal their fit to the IIC, as opposed to follow their ‘sincere’
underlying motivations. While strategic behavior is possible, it is unlikely to be driving our
results in part due to the broad range of our experimental outcomes. Strategic incentives would
be absent, in particular, during the registration stage where clicking on the email and/or website
is a spontaneous response, and is carried out privately, as far as the subjects are concerned. Thus,
consistent results between application and click behaviors lend support to underlying motivations
driving the results as opposed to strategic thinking. We also carry out (unreported) exploratory
analysis to find that it is indeed the more socially motivated women entrepreneurs applying in
the social condition by the heterogeneity in our effects. We gauge “sincere” pro-social motivation
by analyzing whether women from more altruistic regions respond more to the social message.
Sub-sample analysis points in that direction qualitatively confirming our hypothesis, though the
resulting small sample size lacks precision.

Conclusion

Entrepreneurial motivation is central to the process of economic growth. We performed three
interrelated experiments with the MIT Inclusive Innovation Challenge to investigate what motivates innovative entrepreneurs to register and apply. Our results show large, systematically
heterogeneous effects across our sample of entrepreneurs: women and individuals located in more
altruistic cultures are more motivated by social impact messages than money, while men and
those in less altruistic cultures are more motivated by money than social impact. These results
highlight the importance of heterogeneous incentives in the choices of innovative entrepreneurs.
A significant amount of research has studied the environmental characteristics that promote or
hinder entrepreneurship, such as the institutions that protect the profit motive (e.g. patents),
and the structural inequalities that preclude certain groups from engaging in innovation. But
much less is known about the preferences and motivations of entrepreneurs themselves, and their

16

variation across demographics and culture. Our results provide an initial step toward investigating the role of different human motivations that impact in the entrepreneurial process. How
these motivations are created and shaped, as well as what can be done to influence them, is a
central question for future research, with implications for generating greater shared prosperity.
Our findings could help partially explain disparities in entrepreneurship. Differing motivations could lead to inequities in what entrepreneurs pursue, how they pitch their commitment to
their startup, and who is funded. For example, innovative entrepreneurs often pitch to investors
like venture capitalists for funding. Given that most venture capitalists operate on the profit
motive, women entrepreneurs’ relative emphasis on pro-social motivations might hinder their
likelihood of receiving funding.
From a policy perspective, our results also have implications for the design of interventions
aimed at fostering innovative entrepreneurship. Interestingly, the heterogeneity we found might
suggest an important trade-off in the design of entrepreneurship policies and programs: seeking
to connect fairly well across different groups might not motivate any group particularly well,
while focusing on one particular approach to motivate entrepreneurship (e.g., money) might
systematically drive away some groups. We view the outcomes of tailored messages, as well
as the trade-offs highlighted in such a process, as important topics for follow-on studies in our
agenda.
Finally, from a managerial perspective, our results emphasize the important role of identity
and individuality for developing strategic advantages at the early stages of the firm. Gans et al.
(2019), for example, emphasize the importance of identity in allowing innovative entrepreneurs
to find a defensible position from which to build their entrepreneurial strategies. Our work
shows that motivations (and not only skills or experiences) constitute an important component
of identity and, presumably, how entrepreneurial competitive advantage is shaped.

Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered by country. *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. Columns (1)-(2)
tests the extensive margin using the dependent variable of whether the recipient clicked on an email link. Columns
(3)-(8) use positive reciprocity, instead of altruism, as an alternative measure of a prosocial culture. Columns (1)-(5s)
use the IIC and Dunn and Bradstreet sample that corresponds to the registration e-mail sample. Column (6)-(8)
consists of the application stage sample. The unit of observation is the individual recipient. We use Logit models
in Columns (1)-(2), a Poisson QMLE model in (3)-(5), and a Logit model in (6)-(8). In Columns (1)-(5), controls
include a dummy indicating whether the recipient was in the IIC or Dunn and Bradstreet list, whether the recipient
was a registrant or applicant to the IIC in prior years, and the `member rating' assigned by marketing tool based on
prior activity. In columns (6)-(8) we control for which category they are registered in, whether they are for-prot,
whether any employees over age 60, whether they serve marginalized populations and number of female employees
(log). Columns (4) and (7) also control for whether the recipient is female while columns (5) and (8) control for the
GDP Per Capital of the country.

This Table looks at dierences in observables across male and female entrepreneurs across our samples. The rst
six characteristics come from the IIC or Dunn and Bradstreet lists (or both if available) in the e-mail registration
experiment while the last six are drawn from the application experiment. Standard errors for p-values are clustered
at regional level (country or US state) to account for within-region correlations.

Robust standard errors in parentheses clustered by country. *** p < 0.01, ** p < 0.05, * p < 0.1. The empirical model is a quasi-maximum likelihood (QMLE) Poisson
model predicting the total number of clicks on email links. The unit of observation is the individual recipient. Columns (1)-(2) use the IIC sample and D&B extended
sample that includes all industries as well as partnerships and not-for-prots. Columns (3)-(4) use the IIC sample and the D&B sub-sample of high-tech industries 
Manufacturing, Information, and Professional, Scientic, and Technical Services  excluding partnerships and not-for-prots. Columns (5)-(6) uses the IIC sample and
the D&B sub-sample of CTO or CIO contacts, also excluding partnerships and not-for-prots. Columns (7)-(8) uses the IIC sample only. Controls include a dummy
indicating whether the recipient was in the IIC or D&B list, whether the recipient was a registrant or applicant to the IIC in prior years, and the `member rating' assigned
by marketing tool based on prior activity. The reduction in observations in columns with interactions with altruism is due to altruism values not being available in the
GPS dataset for a few countries.
