INTRODUCTION
Following upon the foundational work of Samuel Stouffer in his 1955 book Communism,
Conformity, and Civil Liberties, the General Social Survey (GSS) has measured support for free
expression in the United states since 1972 (see Davis 2012). Although some of Stouffer’s original
items have been retained, variants on his items have been developed in response to changes in
the contested domains of free expression.
The five long-run GSS reference individuals whose free expression is placed before the
respondent are: an atheist, a racist, a communist, a militarist, and a homosexual. These oneword descriptions, although used in the literature and encoded in the GSS mnemonic variable
names, can be a bit misleading. For example, the “atheist” is “somebody who is against all
churches and religion,” not someone who denies the existence of all deities. The mode and
arena of free expression for these reference individuals are speaking in the community, teaching
in a college or university, and having a book in the local public library.
For the 2008 GSS, a sixth reference individual was introduced, “a Muslim clergyman
who preaches hatred of the United States.” Table 1 (see next page) presents the order and
wording of the 18 items, as they have been fixed from 2008 through 2018.
For the 2020 GSS, a review of the free expression items suggested revisions to “a Muslim
clergyman who preaches hatred of the United States,” as part of a broader effort by the GSS
Board to reassess all GSS items that are gender-specific in some way. Two gender-neutral
alternatives were discussed, “an Islamic cleric who preaches hatred of the United States” and
“an Islamic religious leader who preaches hatred of the United States.”
For the reasons detailed below, it is possible that a switch to “an Islamic cleric who
preaches hatred of the United States” could prompt an undesirable discontinuity in response
patterns, beyond what could be expected to result from a gender-neutral substitution. If some
GSS respondents are more likely to suspect that the referenced Islamic cleric has a connection to
terrorism, the elicited response may be a mixture of opposition to free expression and a
perceived fear of physical violence, with more weighting on the latter. In contrast, “an Islamic
religious leader who preaches hatred of the United States” may be preferable, if it is the case
that GSS respondents are no more likely to infer a threat to their security than is the case for “a
Muslim clergyman who preaches hatred of the United States.”
In this report, I offer two sets of results to inform decisions about the questionnaire for
the 2020 GSS. First, to set the background, I use GSS data from 2008 through 2018 to summarize
levels and changes in attitudes toward free expression for all six existing reference individuals.
Second, I offer results from a three-armed experiment that compares “Muslim clergyman” to
the two alternatives of “Islamic cleric” and “Islamic religious leader.” The experimental data
were collected over the web in January and February of 2019 as part of the AmeriSpeak panel.

RESULTS FROM THE GSS
Table 2 presents the percentages of 2018 GSS respondents who offer tolerant responses
to the 18 free expression items (i.e., approval of the expression).1 Tolerance is lowest for the
Muslim clergyman, followed by the racist, and then other reference individuals. Tolerance for
teaching in college is considerably lower for four of the six reference individuals: the atheist,
racist, militarist, and Muslim clergyman.

Table 3 presents the corresponding changes per year in the percentages since 2008,
estimated from an underlying logit model with a linear constraint on change. Increases in
tolerance are steady and substantial for the atheist, communist, militarist, and homosexual, with
some slight variation across arena. For the racist, change is in the opposite direction, with little
or no change for a speech in the community. Finally, for the Muslim clergyman, tolerance has
increased very slightly.2

EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN
[ This section is drawn from the project registration “A Question-Wording Experiment on
Support for Free Expression,” which was posted to the website of the Open Science
Framework (see https://osf.io/jaxdy/) before the experiment was conducted. The rationale for
the preregistration of experiments is explained in Nosek et al. (2018); see also
https://cos.io/prereg/.]

Preregistered Design and Hypotheses
Overview. The study is a three-armed, equal-probability, randomized questionwording experiment on support for free expression. The treatment conditions are defined by
alternative characterizations of a reference individual whose free expression could be subject to
limitation because of perceived individual or societal threat from the content or delivery of the
expression. The survey respondents in the study are asked to express attitudes on whether
limitations to free expression should be imposed in three alternative arenas: speaking to your
community, teaching in a college or university, or having a book in your public library. The
baseline reference individual is the reference individual for the 2008-18 General Social Surveys
(GSS), “a Muslim clergyman who preaches hatred of the United States.” The two alternatives
introduced for this experiment are “an Islamic cleric who preaches hatred of the United States”
and “an Islamic religious leader who preaches hatred of the United States.”
Goal of the study. Although the hypotheses articulated below are of general social
scientific interest, an additional goal of the study is to inform an upcoming decision by the
Board of Overseers of the GSS on revisions to question wording for the 2020 GSS. My
expectation is that the 2020 GSS will have a randomized split-ballot alternative wording with
either “Islamic cleric” or “Islamic religious leader” as a single alternative to the existing
“Muslim clergyman.” Although the Board will make the decision, my prediction is that
“Islamic religious leader” will be favored because it is broad, simple to understand, and will be
judged less likely to change in perceived meaning in the future than “Islamic cleric.” In
addition, I predict that the existing “Muslim clergyman” will be retired from the survey
instrument, possibly as soon as the 2022 GSS, because it is somewhat awkward and genderspecific. Altogether, this supplementary operational goal of the study, therefore, is to inform
the decision of the Board so that arguments in favor of particular question wordings are
informed by reasonable forecasts of the consequences for marginal distributions of any changes.
Target population and intended sample. The target population is the general
population of adults in the US, as defined for NORC’s AmeriSpeak. The intended sample is
2,000 respondents.
Mode of administration. The questions are “self-administered,” in this case read and
answered online, as presented by NORC’s AmeriSpeak online instrument.

4

Additional measures collected. NORC’s AmeriSpeak delivers a standard set of
“demographic variables,” which also include party identification, political ideology, and
religious preference. (In addition, because this is a TESS short study, it is likely to be combined
with and possibly preceded by another set of questions for another study. These other
questions may induce a context effect on this experiment. I do not know what such other
studies might be, nor whether the measures they collect will be shared with me.)
Treatment assignment. The three experimental conditions are randomly assigned with
equal probability, using a randomization procedure implemented by NORC’s programming for
AmeriSpeak.
The Three Treatments (with Alternative Wordings in Red Bold and Underlined)

other people. Consider a Muslim clergyman who preaches hatred of the United
States.

Hypotheses
Null hypothesis. All three treatment conditions will yield appreciably similar
responses.
Rationale. Given that the most salient and explicitly threatening part of the
battery of items is “preaches hatred of the United States,” the salience of the
reference individual is too low, in relative terms, to matter to respondents. In
addition, the “Islamic cleric” and “Islamic religious leader” may be interpreted
as little more than non-gender-specific equivalences for “Muslim clergyman”
(because clerics are, by many dictionary definitions, simply members of the
clergy, and because clerics and members of the clergy are types of religious
leaders). Finally, the word “Islamic” is only a slight alternative to “Muslim,”
while the “man” portion of “clergyman” may already be elided by the ears/eyes
of respondents (i.e., as antiquated speech that hangs around because it is
preferable to ungainly substitutes, such as “clergyperson,” that are not used
commonly in speech).
Alternative hypothesis 1 (unconditional). Respondents will extend fewer opportunities
for free expression to the “Islamic cleric” than to the “Muslim clergyman.”
Rationale. Respondents who are attuned to media portrayals of Islam may be
more likely to associate an “Islamic cleric” with terrorism and violence, above
and beyond the threat conveyed already by the more abstract “preaches hatred
of the United States.” Any such respondents may perceive even greater threat
because of the inference that terrorism could be inspired by the referenced
“Islamic cleric,” perhaps through the specific content of the free speech (and
which, by inference, could be interpreted as direct incitement to the type of
imminent lawlessness and violence that has not been seen as protected free
speech by US courts). The term “Muslim clergyman” would seem to have a less
clear relative valence. On the one hand, some respondents, at the time this study
is to be conducted, may associate it with the “Muslim ban” that was a major
media and political topic in 2017 and 2018. On the other hand, for respondents
who are less attuned to current events and/or have smaller vocabularies,

7

“clergyman” may elicit some baseline positive sentiment because the word
“clergy” is frequently used with reference to Christianity.
Alternative hypothesis 1-a (partisanship interaction). This effect will be
strongest among those who identify as Republicans, or leaning
Republicans (in comparison to Democrats and leaning Democrats)
because (a) Republican political elites are more likely to associate
Islam with terrorism and violence and (b) those who identify as
Republicans are either influenced by Republican political elites or
are attracted to Republican political elites.
Alternative hypothesis 1-b (arena interaction). This effect will be
strongest when the threat of imminent violence is possible, such as
for the first question on a speech in the community.
Alternative hypothesis 2 (unconditional). Respondents will extend more opportunities
for free expression to the “Islamic religious leader” than to the “Islamic cleric.”
Rationale. If a threat-of-violence mechanism is triggered by the description of the
reference individual, then the “Islamic religious leader” may be granted more
opportunities for free expression than the “Islamic cleric” if “Islamic religious
leader” triggers fewer implicit associations with the threat of violence. A
“religious leader” is a more generic category and a broader title.
Alternative hypotheses 2-a and 2-b. Direct analogues to alternative
hypotheses 1-a and 1-b.
Alternative hypothesis 3 (unconditional). Respondents will extend (slightly) fewer
opportunities for free expression to the “Islamic religious leader” than to the
“Muslim clergyman.”
Rationale. The basic rationale is the same as for alternative hypothesis 1, but the
effect is likely weaker because of the rationale for alternative hypothesis 2. The
effect would be present if the positive sentiment induced by “clergy” is greater
than the negative sentiment induced by “Muslim.” Little prior information is
available to assess these possibilities, which, in the current context, may be
especially complex because of recent debates over the constitutionality of the
proposed “Muslim ban” to the US (and how those debates interact with
sentiment toward alternative political leaders in the US). It is possible that this
hypothesis will not be supported because a diverse coalition of individuals will
extend more opportunities for free expression to the “Muslim clergyman” (such
as conservative Christians who have warm feelings for all members of the clergy,
along with libertarians and progressives who directly oppose the Muslim ban).

8

Alternative hypotheses 3-a and 3-b. Direct analogues to alternative
hypotheses 1-a and 1-b.
Additional Discussion of the Design and Hypotheses
The hypotheses are somewhat specific to the United States. In a country where Islam is
well understood, an “Islamic cleric” could yield an alternative response pattern because the
“cleric” may more commonly reference an individual who is an Islamic scholar with recognized
expertise in interpreting Islamic texts. In addition, the reverence for insight and wisdom of
such scholars is not necessarily granted to a “religious leader,” who may be more likely to
genuinely threaten violence because of adherence to an especially politicized form of Islam, or
ongoing between-state conflict.3
Because of the following factors, there is reason to expect that even the baseline
reference individual will elicit alternative distributions of support for free expression than is the
case for the GSS (where the implicit reference point is the 2018 GSS):
1. The online mode of the NORC AmeriSpeak differs from the face-to-face (and,
when necessary, phone) mode of the GSS.
2. The NORC AmeriSpeak sample is constructed in an alternative fashion and has
some systematic differences from the GSS target population (e.g., how nonEnglish speakers are handled and so forth).
3. The NORC AmeriSpeak instrument has a different context. The GSS items for
the “Muslim clergyman” follow other batteries of similar items for reference
individuals, such as the Stoufferian “admitted communist.”

In many such countries, where survey instruments would be written in a language other than English,
comparative analysis would require a translation of the reference individual. Based on discussions with
colleagues, I believe that both “Islamic cleric” and “Islamic religious leader” have available translations in
many countries where Islam is a common religion. It may be that “Muslim clergyman” would be
translated in the same way as “Islamic cleric.”

Results of the Experiment
Details of the data collection are provided in the AmeriSpeak field report, posted at this
URL link https://osf.io/bf5mh/. The total N for the experiment was 2,019 respondents, although
missing data reduces some of the analysis below to effectives Ns as low as 2,002.
Table 4 presents percent tolerant for the three experimental conditions. For the speech
and library arenas, the results for the Muslim clergyman are very close to the results for the
GSS: 48.3 and 52.5 percent for the experiment in comparison to 48.3 and 53.3 percent for the
GSS, respectively (see Table 1). However, the experiment suggested a lower level of support for
teaching in a college or university: 28.4 percent for the experiment in comparison to 36.0
percent for the GSS. It is plausible that this difference is a context effect. For the GSS, the
Muslim clergyman items are delivered after all of the other reference individuals. By then, the
respondent has likely determined that the domain being investigated is something like support
for free speech, not employment patterns. However, for the AmeriSpeak experiment, no prior
reference individuals are offered. And, because “clergyman” is a type of occupation, it is
possible that some AmeriSpeak respondents are expressing a view that teaching in college
should be reserved those in teaching occupations, not religious occupations. The same context
effect could be in place for both the Islamic cleric and the Islamic religious leader.

Source: Morgan’s tabulations of the AmeriSpeak implementation of study “TESS 030 – Morgan.”
Notes: The N varies between 2,002 and 2,019 because of non-responses to the outcome questions and based on
whether covariates are used in the models. The distribution across the three treatments was meant to be equal (i.e.,
resulting in 673 cases each), but in practice the randomization resulted in a distribution with 709, 660, and 650
respondents in each of the three conditions. This was a somewhat unlikely realized distribution. The probability of a
random allocation of 2,019 cases producing a result with a treatment condition N as high as 709 is only 0.14.

Overall, Table 4 shows that tolerance is slightly higher for the Muslim clergyman than
for the Islamic cleric, with the Islamic religious leader in between. Table 5 presents tests for
these differences across the three experimental conditions. The differences suggest weak
evidence against the global null hypothesis, as there are meaningful differences that cannot be
easily attributed to random variation from sampling or treatment assignment. In line with
hypotheses 1 and 1-b, tolerance for the Islamic cleric is lower than for the Muslim clergyman,
and more so in face-to-face modes of expression. The analogous hypotheses 2, 2-b, 3, and 3-b
have very weak support, if any at all.

Table 6 presents differences that are relevant to evaluations of hypotheses 1a, 2a, and 3a,
regarding partisan variation in the treatment effects evaluated for Table 5. One way to evaluate
these hypotheses is to test for variation in the association between partisanship and tolerance,
across each of the three treatments. With a standard seven-category party identification scale -from strong Democrat at 1 to strong Republican at 7 – the hypotheses suggest that partisanship,
for example, will be most strongly negatively associated with tolerance for the Islamic cleric in
the speech domain. Table 6 shows that the strength of identification as a Republican is
consistently associated with lower tolerance, but variation across treatments and arenas is
weakly patterned. These results, therefore, provide little or no evidence to support hypotheses
1a, 2a, and 3a, thereby suggesting that revision to the reference individual is unlikely to
generate discontinuous change differentially across party identification. An experiment with a
larger sample of respondents could provide enough additional precision to reveal a pattern that
suggests otherwise.

CONCLUSIONS
The goal of the AmeriSpeak experiment was to determine which of two alternatives –
the Islamic cleric or the Islamic religious leader – would be a better choice for a split-ballot
experiment alongside the Muslim clergyman for the 2020 GSS (under the assumption that the
GSS board is predisposed to test one or the other against the gender-specific Muslim
clergyman).
As an alternative to the Muslim clergyman, respondents appear slightly less tolerant of
the Islamic cleric, but only clearly so in the speech domain. The Islamic religious leader
produces a response pattern that is closer to the one elicited for the Muslim clergyman.
This pattern tips the scales in favor of the Islamic religious leader rather than the Islamic
cleric, if the goal of the GSS board remains one of finding a permanent alternative for the
Muslim clergyman. A split-ballot experiment for the 2020 GSS that compares the responses to
the Muslim clergyman to those for the Islamic religious leader would enable a more direct test
12

of whether the two reference individuals are similar enough than migrating to only the Islamic
religious leader is sensible. If, however, the response pattern is different, then a case can be
made for continuing the split-ballot experiment for the 2022 GSS, or indefinitely in order to
establish as second time series.
