ABSTRACT
Sustainable food security at household level is one of the emerging issues for all nations. There are
several factors such as social, economic, political, demographic, natural, and livelihood strategies
that causes to the vulnerability of the status of household food security. Therefore examining the
vulnerability of these factors is essential to identify the reason and recognize the most vulnerable
communities. This study is an attempt to study on the vulnerability of the factors of household food
availability and its linkage with climatic changes in Malaysia. The study is based on primary data
collected in the months of July – October, 2012 through a questionnaire survey on 460 low income
households from East Coast Economic Region (ECER) in Malaysia. The samples were selected
from E-Kasih poor household database, based on cluster random sampling technique. The study
found that the vulnerability of the factors of household food availability has decreased statistically
significantly over the last five years period in Malaysia for the factors of effectiveness of food
distribution process, road and transportation facility for food distribution process, availability of
expected food in the local market, sufficiency of expected food in the local market, and stability of
food supply in market. The mean values of the current status of the factors of household food
availability differ significantly at 1% significance level from the scenario of 5 years ago. However,
most of the cases climatic issues were found less responsible for the changes of these factors.
Though Malaysia is adversely affected by climatic change, the factors of food availability are not
affected yet remarkably. This study suggests that the food security programs need to be integrated
with climatic change adaptation programs to ensure more effective and sustainable household food
security in future, especially among the poor and low income group. Moreover, a proper
monitoring agency is required to ensure consistent supply of food in the rural and remote areas,
especially at the time of natural calamity or off season.

INTRODUCTION
Food security is a critical global aspect of the individual and household wellbeing
regardless of whether it is viewed locally, globally or within communities. Hunger and
food insecurity are detrimental to the basic rights of a human being and are a prelude to
problems including health, nutrition, and development. The household food security is a
more current understanding of the food security concept. Most of the literature in this
subject from the 1980s assumed national food security to be similar to food selfsufficiency and this poses a few challenges. According to Debebe (1995) household food
security represents factors, which are linked to the actions of “…acquisition, household
procurement strategies and socio-economic condition of the society.”

145
Various types of indicators are required to measure the many different aspects of
food security at an individual, household, and country levels (Hoddinott, 1999). Various
correlated environmental, socioeconomic, and political aspects that need multi-pronged
approaches have an influence on food security (Debebe, 1995). Negatu (2006) suggested
that one of the factors that have an effect on food security is land tenure insecurity and
the other is not having accessibility to productive resources, low educational level,
reduction in land holdings, not having accessibility to proper transport structure, low
livestock productivity, unaware of suitable interventions, bad storage technology, and a
high unemployment level. Other factors that also have an effect on food security include
crop pests, drought, and sudden torrential rainfall, not having a draught oxen, increased
population and shortage of land (Negatu, 2006).
Natural indicators result in specific higher variation in production costs and
production that are linked to irrigation, infection and insecticide treatment and higher
losses (Lovendal & Knowles, 2006). Depending on the capability of traders bringing in
food from various other areas and the available stock levels, this could potentially disrupt
food supply and cause prices to increase further. The main environmental indicators
prove to be trends and not shocks that occur. They negatively affect production through
reduced soil fertility and lower yields as well as the rise of production cost per unit. The
profitability of farming and the potential to gain income from other activities that are
resource based are limited.
There are four dimensions of food security such as availability of food, stability
of its supply, accessibility to food, and utilization of food. A vulnerable food system
occurs when any dimensions of food security are insecure and uncertain. Understanding
the vulnerability of the factors of food security can assist in the identification and
comprehension of the fundamental dimension of a population’s wellbeing and to
recognize the most vulnerable communities in the regions or subgroups.
As like as other dimensions, household food availability is also very important
for household food security that indicates sufficient quantities of suitable quality food
supplied at household via local inputs or production. The kind of quality and quantity of
food available in the market is dependent on the market’s characteristics. The market
infrastructure has an effect on food availability. As such, the market condition of various
households from various infrastructure development places give rise to various levels of
food availability. Thus, an important determinant of food security is the infrastructure
access (Nyariki & Wiggins, 1997). Similarly, Webb et al. (1992) and Negatu (2006)
revealed that one of the reasons for the famine in Ethiopia is the isolation of the farming
households from the major markets. Several factors that have an effect on the availability
of household calories needs are such as the household’s demography including household
dependents like children and elders, gender of the head of household, education status of
the household head and other household members (Iram & Butt, 2004). Technology
availability at the household level has an effect on the capacity of crop production,
production conditions, and resources productivity. These involve availability and
capability to utilize enhanced crop varieties, other aids like pesticides and fertilizers, and
irrigation water in areas that are semi-arid (Nyariki & Wiggins, 1997).
Malaysia is a very fast growing developing country. So, there are scopes of
frequent changes in the macro variables that would affect food security. Moreover, the
climatic factors are changing very rapidly in Malaysia and have been having adverse
impacts on food production (Alam et al., 2011b; 2012a). Even, that household food
insecurity is not only related to social and economic factors, but also statistically
significantly linked to the direct and indirect impacts of climatic factors (Alam et al.,
2016a). Previous studies showed that 50% or more of the low-income rural households
face some level of food insecurity with 34.5% child hunger (Shariff & Khor, 2008). The
percentage of households with food insecurity in Malaysia is higher in urban low-income
households, such as 66.6% (Zalilah, 1998) and 65.7% (Zalilah & Ang, 2001) compared to
rural low-income households 58% (Shariff & Khor, 2008). Another recent study showed
that among the poor and low income household, 23.3% are mildly food insecure, 14.3%

146
are moderately food insecure, and 9.6% are severely food insecure in Malaysia (Alam et
al., 2016b).
Therefore, to understand the level of vulnerability of household food security,
this study is an attempt to check food availability – one of the important dimensions of
household food security, and its linkage with climatic changes in Malaysia.
CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOUSEHOLD FOOD AVAILABILITY
Climate changes affect the fundamental aspects of food production, which include water,
soil, and biodiversity, negatively. In a broader viewpoint, it has an effect on all the four
types of food security’s dimensions (FAO, 2008). FAO also highlighted the impacts of
the components of climatic changes on household food availability that are given in
Table 1.

HOUSEHOLD FOOD AVAILABILITY
COMPONENTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE

IMPACTS ON FOOD AVAILABILITY

CO2 fertilization effects

• Increased food production in major exporting
countries would contribute to global food supply
but diversion of land from food to more
economically attractive cash crops could negate
this benefit

Increase in global mean temperatures

• Reduced production of food crops and livestock
products in affected areas
• Local losses could have temporary effect on local
markets
• Reduction in global supplies likely to cause
market prices to rise

Gradual changes in precipitation (increase in
the frequency, duration and intensity of dry
spells and droughts)

• Declines in production
• Wild foods less available
• Pressure on grain reserves
• Decrease in food exports / increase in food
imports
• Increased need for food aid

Gradual changes in precipitation (changes in
timing, location and amounts of rain and
snowfall)

• Some local losses virtually certain, but their
likely geographic distribution is not known
• Likely impact on global supplies, trade and world
market prices is not known

Gradual changes in precipitation (increase in
the frequency, duration and intensity of dry
spells and droughts)

• Declines in production; Wild foods less available
• Pressure on grain reserves
• Decrease in food exports / increase in food
imports
• Increased need for food aid

Impacts of increase in the frequency and
intensity of extreme weather events (increase
in annual occurrence of high winds, heavy
rains, storm surges, flash floods and rising
water levels associated with tornados,
tropical storms, and prolonged heavy rains)

• Possible decrease in surplus production in
flooded agricultural areas
• Increased need for emergency distribution of
food rations

In general, climate change is expected to cause the number of people at risk from hunger
to grow (FAO, 2005). Most crops have yearly cycles, and with climate changes,
especially with temperature and rainfall, the yields will fluctuate as well. It is therefore
challenging to maintain a continuous food supply with seasonal production. Floods and
droughts are a major threat to stability of food and could result in transitory and chronic
food insecurities. Both these occurrences are anticipated to occur more frequently,
intensely and with less predictability as a result of changes in the climate. Rural areas that
depend on rainfall for their agriculture, the changes in the frequency and amount of
rainfall in a particular season will trigger an unpredictable local food system production.
In the case of rural people who tend to produce a large portion of food for own
consumption, the effects of climate change on food production may lower the availability
to the extent that choices of allocation would have to be determined inside a household.
Similar choices will be faced by the rural and urban non-farming low-income households
whose incomes are below the poverty line due to the effects of climate change.
Urbanization is a worldwide phenomenon and a large number of the growing population
in the urban areas are considered poor (Ruel et al., 1998). Therefore, over time, the
allocation problems due to climate change would potentially become more prevalent in
the urban areas.
When climate affects the infrastructure through higher frequency of floods that
damage the infrastructure or heat stress on roads, there are effects on food distribution,
which has an impact on having access to markets to purchase or sell food by the people
(Abdulai & CroleRees, 2001). Extreme weather pattern changes will have an impact on
the stability and accessibility of food supply. Studies pointed out that the growing trend
of crop loss due to extreme occurrences will far outweigh the slight positive effects of an
average rise in temperature (Easterling et al., 2007). In forest regions, it is estimated that
there would be more risks of fires, wind damages, insect infestations and other forestrelated disturbances. The change in the number of extreme occurrences will most
probably have serious repercussions on small farming communities and artisanal
fishermen (Easterling et al., 2007). Loss of livelihood and food insecurity would increase
further with cultivated land loss and fish nurseries through coastal erosion and inundation
in low-lying regions (FAO, 2003a).
According to FAO, up to the year 2030, the effect of climate change on global
crop production will only be slight. However, after that, widespread drops in the level
and productivity potential of cropland could happen, and several of the worst effects
would probably be in the present food-insecure regions in the sub-Saharan Africa, which
have the least capability to adapt to climate change or to import more food to compensate
for the loss (Fischer et al., 2001; FAO, 2003b: 358).
In case of Malaysia the rainfall may fluctuate from about -30% to +30% and the
temperature is projected to rise by 0.3 oC to 4.5oC due to high greenhouse gas emissions
that will cause sea level to rise about 95cm over a hundred year-period (NRS, 2001).
Another projection by NAHRIM (2006) shows that maximum monthly precipitation will
increase up to 51% in the states of Pahang, Kelantan and Terengganu, while the
minimum precipitation will decrease ranging from 32% to 61% all over Peninsular
Malaysia; the annual rainfall will increase up to 10% in Kelantan, Terengganu, Pahang
and North West Coast, and decrease up to 5% in Selangor and Johor. Moreover, here the
variation of amount of rainfall is very high (Alam et al., 2011a). This variation of climatic
factors will make the agricultural system vulnerable, reduce crop yield and cause drought
in many areas and cultivation of some crops may not be any more possible. A study
found that a 1% increase in temperature leads to 3.44% decrease in current paddy yield,

148
and .03% decrease in paddy yield in next season and a 1% increase in rainfall leads to
.12% decrease in current paddy yield, and .21% decrease of paddy yield in next season
(Alam et al., 2014). Since agriculture is heavily dependent on climatic conditions,
changes in the climatic factors result in year-to-year and area-to-area variability of crop
production which largely affects the social and economic sustainability of the farmers
(Alam et al., 2011b).
DATA AND METHODOLOGY
Data Collection
Data for this study were collected through an extensive questionnaire survey at household
level in East Coast Economic Region (ECER) in Malaysia. ECER is more than half of the
Peninsular Malaysia with the area of about 66,000sq km that covers the states Kelantan,
Terengganu, Pahang, and Mersing in Johor (Figure 1). ECER is very crucial for two
major reasons; (a) ECER is the most vulnerable area in Malaysia due to climatic changes
and (b) the income level of this region is low and poverty rate is high that is an obstacle
to achieve Vision 2020.
FIGURE 1: LOCATION OF STUDY AREA (ECER-MALAYSIA)

Source: Alam et al., 2012b
This study is based on primary data collected from 460 households in the urban
and rural areas of ECER. The urban area of Kuantan and rural area of Pekan were
selected from Pahang state. The urban area of Kota Bharu and rural area of Tumpat were
chosen from Kelantan state. The urban area of Kuala Terengganu and rural area of
Maring were taken from Terengganu state. A questionnaire guide technique was used to
collect data. The survey was conducted by the regular enumerators of the Implementation
Coordination Unit (ICU) from Pahang, Kelantan, and Terengganu states in the months of
July–October, 2012. The survey followed the cluster random sampling technique.
Initially the samples were clustered by location and then by poverty category. Finally,
from each category, samples were picked up randomly from the E-Kasih database. EKasih system has been an integrated database system that has enlisted poor households at
the national level to plan, implement, and monitor poverty programs in Malaysia.
Variables and Statistical Analysis

149
There are many factors relevant to the vulnerability of household food security due to
climatic changes and non-climatic/general changes. To measure the degree of
vulnerability of these factors, the perception of the households has been shown in two
forms – using the scale of 1 (very low) to 5 (very high), and determine the changes by
comparing current status with the scenario of 5 years ago. This study also checks the
equality of two means between the current status of the relevant factors and five years
earlier factors through ANOVA F statistics for Chi-Square (χ2) Two Sample Test.

ANALYSIS AND DISCUSSIONS
Demographic Characteristics
Among the respondents of the study, around 60% are selected from the urban area and
40% from the rural area. Male are the majority group, but the respondents represent the
household data. The average age of all respondents is 50.7 years whereby male is 48.9
and female is 54.7. Most of the respondents have secondary education (46.5%) followed
by basic primary education (35.9%). Among the total respondents, 72.8% are married
whereas 3% are unmarried. Most of the families (20.7%) have 5 persons in the household
and average family members are 5.6 persons per household. Among the respondents,
most of the households (63.3%) have no children (below 6 years) and average number of
children (below 6 years) per household is 0.6. Most of the households (24.1%) have no
school going children (below 6 years) and average number of school going children per
household is 2.2.
Among the households, 83.7% have their own residence. The respondents are
engaged in various types of jobs, such as babysitter, batik designer, building contractor,
small business, bus driver, canteen assistant, car service, carpenter, chief, clerk, cleaner,
construction worker, craftsman, electrical technician, van driver, fisherman, fruit dealer,
furniture shop, gardener, jewelry shop, hawker, daily labor, farmer, meson, painter,
plumber, saloon worker, security guard, imam, teacher, government job, tailor, taxi
driver, welding, factory labor, etc. In 90% of the cases, the heads of the households do
not have any supplementary job. The rural households have more supplementary job
options than urban households. The spouses of most of the households (88.3%) are not
engaged in a job. Around 76.3% of the households have only one earning member. At the
household level, on an average, the earning family members to total family members
ratio is 0.287.
The household income of most of the respondents is between RM 501-1000
range. 35% of the household’s monthly income is up to RM500 and 3.6% household’s
income is above RM 2000. The per-capita income of 59.3% of respondents is up to
RM200. According to the survey findings, around 55% are still poor and hard core poor.

150
Around 9% of the people have an income of more than RM 400, who might be excluded
in the low income group list soon.1 The distribution of income among the surveyed
household is not so wide. However, here, the top 10% receive 23.2% of the total income
while the bottom 10% receive only 3.4% of the income, and the top 20% receive 36.9%
of the total income while the bottom 20% receive only 8.8%. The degree of inequality is
measured by Inequality Ratio, also known as Kuznets ratio. Here, the ratio is 1.624 if
measured at household level and 1.405 is measured in terms of population. Among the
respondents, around 82% do not have any savings. Therefore, any type of spike in regular
life due to natural disasters, disease, crime, or social issues will push them towards
borrowing. The rural households are less savings holders compared to urban households.
Assessment of Vulnerability
The changes in the effectiveness of food distribution process (X1) in Malaysia over the
last five years are found statistically significant at 1% level (Table 3). However, only
47% of the respondents mention the change is positive and overall the average score
increases from 2.65 to 3.39 (Table 2). It indicates that the vulnerability of the
effectiveness of food distribution process in Malaysia has decreased over the time.

The changes in the road and transportation facility for food distribution process
(X2) in Malaysia over the last five years are found statistically significant at 1% level
(Table 3). However, 54% of the respondents mention the change is positive and overall
the average score increases from 2.7 to 3.52 (Table 2). It indicates that the road and
transportation facility for food distribution process in Malaysia has decreased over the
time. The changes in the availability of expected food in the local market (X3) in
Malaysia over the last five years are found statistically significant at 1% level (Table 3).
However, 55% of the respondents mention the change is positive and overall the average
score increases from 2.77 to 3.6 (Table 2). It indicates that the vulnerability of
availability of expected food in the local market in Malaysia has decreased over the time.
The changes in the sufficiency of expected food in the local market (X4) in
Malaysia over the last five years are found statistically significant at 1% level (Table 3).
However, only 48% of the respondents mention the change is positive and overall the
average score increases from 2.9 to 3.6 (Table 2). It indicates that the vulnerability of
availability of expected food in the local market in Malaysia has decreased over the time.
The changes in the household food shortages due to unavailability of food in market (X5)
over the last five years are found statistically significant at 1% level (Table 3). However,
only 31.3% of the respondents mention the change is positive and overall the average
score increases from 2.17 to 2.48 (Table 2). It indicates that the vulnerability of the
household food shortages due to unavailability of food in market has increased over the
time.
The changes in the stability of food supply in market (X6) over the last five
years are found statistically significant at 1% level (Table 3). However, only 32.6% of the
respondents mention the change is positive and overall the average score increases from
2.65 to 2.99 (Table 2). It indicates that the vulnerability of the stability of food supply in
market has decreased over the time. For all of the cases, most of the respondents mention
that the influences of climatic factors are low for the changes of these food availability
factors over the five years time (Table 2).
CONCLUSIONS
The study found that the vulnerability of the factors of food availability has decreased
statistically significantly over the last five years period in Malaysia, except the
vulnerability of the factor of household food shortages due to unavailability of food in
market. Though the score of this factor shows vulnerability has increased but majority of
the respondents, around 68.7%, mention the vulnerability has decreased.
The mean values of the current status of the factors of household food
availability differ significantly at 1% significance level from the scenario of 5 years ago.
However, most of the cases climatic issues were found less responsible for the changes of
these factors. Though Malaysia is adversely affected by climatic change, the factors of
food availability are not affected yet remarkably.
However, climate change is considered as one of the major potential threats for
household food security in Malaysia. Therefore, to ensure sustainable household food

152
security in Malaysia, design of food security programs must integrate climatic change
into the picture, and food security approaches must recognize climate change as an
important driver. This integration also increases household capacity to adapt to climatic
change. At the same time, climate change adaptation approaches and strategies to reduce
vulnerability to climate change also increases household food security. Moreover, there
should be a proper monitoring body to ensure consistent supply of food in the rural and
remote areas, especially at the time of natural calamity or off season.

The hardcore poor are considered those with Ringgit Malaysia (RM) 0-110 income per
person per month, for the rural area and RM 0-120 RM per person per month, for the
urban area. The poor are considered those with RM 111-185 income per person per
