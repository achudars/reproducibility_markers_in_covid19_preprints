"3" "Robert Z. Selden, Jr."
"4" "Far better an approximate answer to the  right  question, which is often vague, than an  exact  answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise (Tukey 1962:13-14)."
"5" "The most distinctive material culture item associated with Caddo groups living in  n ortheast Texas is the ceramic vessel manufactured for cooking, storing, and serving needs, which are regularly included in burials. The decorative styles that adorn these ceramics hint at the temporal spans and geographic extents associated with ancestral Caddo groups that were once widespread across the region. The diversity of decorative motifs and elements associated with Caddo ceramics is substantial, as seen in utility ware jars and bowls, as well as fine ware bottles, carinated bowls, and compound vessels. These characteristics are related to distinctive communities of practice and identity, where potters shared a group identity that may be reconstructed through the analysis of suites of technological and stylistic attributes (Eckert et al. 2015:2)."
"6" "Caddo potters also manufactured vessels in a wide variety of shapes (Perttula 2015a; Selden  2017, 2018a, 2018b, 2019 ; Selden et al. 2014), employing unique technological traditions associated with suites of attributes that included temper choice, surface finishing treatments, and firing conditions that articulate with well-crafted body and rim designs (Perttula 2010). Judging from  the archaeological contexts in which Caddo ceramics have been found, as well as inferences surrounding their manufacture and use, it is evident that ceramics were important to ancestral Caddo peoples for the cooking and serving of foods and beverages, as storage containers, personal possessions, beautiful works of art and craftsmanship, and social identifiers. Certain shared and distinctive stylistic motifs and decorative patterns conceptually distinguish closely related communities and constituent groups, and the co-presence of specific artifact types has informed the iterative development and refinement of the numerous Caddo phases and periods used heuristically to understand and explain the ancestral Caddo cultural landscape."
"7" "The detection and interpretation of relationships between the subjects of research interest--ceramic vessels and arrow points in this study--are the primary goals of network analysis (Brughmans 2010:277). It is of considerable importance to recognize that the results presented here are based upon the incomplete and fragmented record of objects left behind by Caddo potters and knappers, and not upon the Caddo potters and knappers themselves. However, the information provided by the ceramic vessels and arrow points inform the production of data-driven theories associated with the Historic Caddo cultural landscape that can be tested in subsequent confirmatory analyses. It is recognized that the full range of complexity associated with social interactions is not captured by social network analysis or complex network techniques (Brughmans 2013:641). However, networks have much to offer in the development of novel, complementary, and competing theories (Borck et al.  2015; Brughmans 2014; Collar et al. 2015; Knappett 2013), and also aid in elucidating the many complex collective dependencies (entanglements) between people and things (Hodder 2012, 2014; Hodder and Mol 2015)."
"8" "Geography and geographic relationships are factors included in this analysis (Collar et al. 2015:6; Sindbæk 2007:70) (Figure 14.1); however, the possibility that these relationships may not have been of particular importance is also acknowledged (Hart 2012:133). Nevertheless, similarities are considered in the Historic Caddo ceramic and lithic assemblages that conform to tribal locations known from ethnographic works, as well as spatial distributions and currently defined material culture areas or phases and periods (Krieger 1944a, 1946)  that are  regularly employed as the foundation of discourse for much of Caddo archaeology (Perttula 2017:8-11). The multi-scalar nature of network analysis (Knappett 2011a:33-35; Mills et al. 2015:19) emphasizes the numerous relational connections that transcend predetermined categories."
"9" "The goal of this exploratory network analysis (Figure 14.2) is the production of novel hypotheses generated through the use of artifact assemblages recovered from  n ortheast Texas  sites , and assumed to date to the Historic Caddo period based upon taxonomic assignment. Through combining ceramic vessels and arrow point assemblages, it is further assumed that the cultural resolution of the aggregated network will be greater than that of an independent ceramic or lithic network. Some of the communities and sub-communities identified in the network articulate with currently defined Historic  Caddo groups and phases, while others represent previously undefined groups that warrant additional scrutiny and testing."
"10" "Assumptions"
"11" "Within the context of this study, it is assumed that the taxonomic and temporal identifications are correct; although it is also acknowledged that the current typological constructs are, themselves, an assumption (Brew 1946; Krieger 1941, 1944b; Rouse 1960). A  substantive  effort has been made to mitigate investigator bias, ensuring that typological identifications remain consistent across the sample; however, it should be noted that bias is also introduced through the algorithms used in the analysis."
"12" "Limitations"
"13" "It is not possible to capture the full extent of assemblage proportions that articulate with the various identified types in the network graphs due to the incomplete and fragmentary nature of the archaeological record. Recognized taxonomic varieties (primarily employed in categorizing fine ware vessels), and vessel shape numbers (Perttula 2015a) ,  were not employed in this analysis. Should the opportunity arise to incorporate additional data from Historic Caddo sites outside of Texas, these networks will change, warranting revisions to those networks and outcomes generated by this analysis."
"14" "Methods"
"15" "Assemblages of diagnostic ceramic and lithic artifacts recovered from post-A.D. 1680 Historic Caddo sites in  n ortheast Texas were used to assess and characterize the potential affiliations and cultural relationships among Caddo  communities. Those relationships can be tested with confirmatory hypotheses that question and clarify the frequency of interaction and contacts between communities; trade, exchange, and abandonment of ceramic vessels; as well as population movements; and capitalize upon the dynamics associated with ceramic technological and morphological organization among Caddo potters."
"16" "The dataset used in the analysis (Perttula 2017) is the product of 20-plus years of vessel and projectile point documentation efforts. Using the temporal assignments associated with taxonomic identifications, each vessel was assigned to one of five periods: Formative Caddo (ca. A.D. 800-1000), Early Caddo (ca. A.D. 1000-1200), Middle Caddo (ca. A.D. 1200-14 0 0), Late Caddo (ca. A.D. 14 0 0-1680), and Historic Caddo (ca. A.D. 1680+). This study focuses upon the  last  period . Data for the Historic Caddo period of  n ortheast Texas were  obtained  on ceramic vessels from 48 sites and include the following attributes: (1) site trinomial or collection name (enlisting the county location/centroid if no trinomial was available); (2) vessel and/or burial number, or other accession/catalog information; (3) vessel form; (4) temper, if known; (5) defined type, if known; (6) defined variety, if known; (7) decorative method or decorative elements for vessels of unknown type-variety, and other pertinent information; and (8) the estimated age of sites that include vessels from burial and/or habitation features (Perttula 2017). In addition to the taxonomic and temporal data available for the ceramics, arrow point data was aggregated from previous analyses of Caddo assemblages."
"17" "The dataset was prepared, then checked for consistency prior to importing these data to R (R Development Core Team 2018) to generate and weight the co-presence networks (Kolaczyk and Csárdi 2014; Luke 2015; Peeples and Roberts 2013). The ceramic and lithic data were made available on Zenodo (Selden  2018c ); however, the site location data (latitude/longitude) spreadsheet was omitted due to the sensitive nature of those data. The two spreadsheets, one with site location information, the other with counts of ceramic and lithic data, were converted to CSV files and imported to R.   It warrants mention that the network analysis method posited here explores the structure of similarities in the data rather than a system of physical routes, and they are based on objects, and not people. Edges in the networks do not correlate with travel, trade or exchange; rather, they illustrate similar attributes in assemblage-level similarities associated with  Historic  Caddo sites in  n ortheast Texas."
"18" "Analysis"
"19" "Three methods were used to define the symmetric similarity and distance matrices to weight the networks: 1, co-presence of types; 2, Brainerd-Robinson (BR) similarity; and 3,  Χ 2 distances. While networks employed in the formal analysis are weighted (Peeples and Roberts 2013), binary networks--where edges are either present or absent-- are  also rendered as an exploratory measure. Weights were applied to the matrices for co-presence, BR, and  Χ 2 distances, then plotted (Peeples 2017). The weighted BR networks were rendered at variable scales to illustrate commonalities between typed dyadic  assemblages at 25, 50 and 75 percent. The  Χ 2 distances used to render the binary networks include defined similarities above 80 percent."
"20" "Archaeological networks are inherently incomplete for a variety of reasons, thus considering the potential impact of missing data from the network is an essential step in assessing the sample. This can have implications for interpretations due to variability in global network structure. The procedure allows for the estimation of the degree that certain aspects of this sample do or do not approximate those same aspects of the larger network from which they  are  derived. Through the production of multiple networks seen in binary and weighted representations, networks of co-presence, BR similarity and  Χ 2 distances, the vulnerability of these data to sampling issues can be assessed (Borgatti and Everett 2006; Costenbader and Valente 2003)."
"21" "Networks were subsampled at intervals of 10 percent, after which calculations for a set of centrality and centralization metrics were rendered for every replicate at each sampling fraction. Spearman’s rho was used to calculate rank-order correlations between metrics for the original network sample and subsample, allowing for an evaluation of the average correlation and error at each sampling fraction (Peeples 2017). Ten thousand replicates were generated for each network. For individual nodes, boxplots were sorted from left to right in rank order of values from the original network, and red lines  were  used to indicate the observed value for each centrality metric for sites in the network using boxplots that illustrate variation across the simulated resampled networks (Peeples 2017). As a final means of analyzing the sample, the relationship  between sample size in the original data is explored,  along with  the range of variation expressed by the estimated 95 percent credible interval for each node (Peeples 2017)."
"22" "The network was subsequently exported from R to Gephi (Bastian et al. 2009), where node (site) locations were plotted using their latitude and longitude with the GeoLayout plugin (Jacomy 2018). The modularity statistic (Blondel et al. 2008; Lambiotte et al. 2014) was then used to identify nodes more densely connected to one another than to the rest of the network based upon the co-presence of specific lithic and ceramic types."
"23" "Results"
"24" "The results of this analysis highlight the contribution of exploratory studies, whereby patterns identified in the data provide a series of novel  a posteriori  hypotheses that can, in turn, be tested and evaluated in subsequent confirmatory analyses. A suite of co-presence networks generated using a similarity matrix were analyzed that employ Historic Caddo ceramic and lithic types recovered from archaeological contexts. In the network graphs, nodes are connected by weighted edges; thus, if one node (site) has more types in common with another node, the edges appear thicker. These data inform the modularity statistic used to identify communities and sub-communities in the network characterized by the suites of ceramic and lithic types found at each site."
"25" "Rank order correlations for degree, eigenvector, and betweenness centrality point toward a high degree of correlation for degree and eigenvector centrality, and lower, more variable ,  correlations for betweenness centrality  for  small samples  (Figure 14.3). In the analysis of values for individual nodes, results point toward a reasonable match between observed and resampled networks for degree (Figure 14.3a) and eigenvector (Figure 14.3b), and a high degree of variability in betweenness centrality (Figure 14.3c). The relationship between sample size in the original data table and the range of variation represented by the estimated 95 percent credible interval for each node (Figure 14.3d-f) illustrates greater variability among sites with small samples for degree and eigenvector, and less predictable results for betweenness. A similar analysis was conducted for binary networks that yielded similar results."
"26" "Historic Caddo Ceramic Vessel and Arrow Point Network"
"27" "The modularity statistic identified two communities based upon the suite of ceramic and lithic  point  types: one in the southern part of  n ortheast Texas (Community 1), and the other from the Sabine River north to the Red River among Nadaco (Fields and Gadus 2012a, 2012b; Perttula 2007; Perttula and Nelson 2007, 2014) and Kadohadacho groups (Community 2) (Table 14.1 and Figure 14.4). A single node (41SA94 in the Angelina River basin) that is not connected to the giant component (ceramic/lithic  point  types) represents an unconnected outlier community. The ceramic type represented at 41SA94 is Belcher Ridged (Suhm and Jelks 1962:11-12). This type is common in Belcher phase (ca. A . D .  1500-1680) components along the Red River in  n orthwest Louisiana (Girard 1999; Kelley 2012; Webb 1956, 1959; Webb and Dodd 1941 ; see Chapter  2 , this volume ) as well as in pre-A . D .  1680 Nasoni Caddo sites on the Red River in  n ortheast Texas (Perttula 2015b; Perttula et al. 2010; Perttula et  al. 2009). For the giant component, the weighted edges are representative of higher and lower similarities between sites based upon the co-presence of Caddo ceramic and lithic  point  types."
"28" "There are 41 defined ceramic types in the Historic Caddo network that include Avery Engraved (AE) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:3, and Plate 2), Bullard Brushed (BB) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:21, and Plate 11), Bailey Engraved (BE) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:5, and Plate 3), Belcher Ridged (BR) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:11, and Plate 16), Cass Appliqued (CA) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:25, and Plate 13), Clements Brushed (CB) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:27, and Plate 14), Cabaness Engraved (CE) (Schambach and Miller 1984), Clement Redware (CR) (Flynn 1976), Ebarb Incised (EI) (Gregory and Avery 2007), Emory Punctated-Incised (EPI) (Story et al. 1967:136-138), Fatherland Incised (FI) (Brown 1998), Foster Trailed-Incised (FTI) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:43, and Plate 22), Hatinu Engraved (HAE) (Perttula and Selden 2014:46, and Figure 39), Hudson Engraved (HDE) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:81, and Plate 41), Hood Engraved (HE) (Perttula and Selden 2014:38, and Figure 30), Hodges Engraved (HOE) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:73, and Plate 37), Hatchel Engraved (HTE) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:67, and Plate 34), Hume Engraved (HUE) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:83, and Plate 42), Karnack Brushed-Incised (KBI) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:85, and Plate 43), Killough Pinched (KP) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:91, and Plate 46), Keno Trailed (KT) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:87, and Plate 44), La   Rue Neck Banded (LRNB) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:93, and Plate 47), Maydelle Incised (MI) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:103, and Plate 152), Moore Noded (MN) (Webb 1959:120, and  Figure 122a-b), Mockingbird Punctated (MOP) (Perttula and Selden 2014:40, and Figure 34a-b), McKinney Plain (MP) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:97, and Plate 49), Natchitoches Engraved (NE) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:113, and Plate 157), Nash Neck Banded (NNB) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:11, and Plate 56), Pease Brushed-Incised (PBI) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:119, and Plate 160), Patton Engraved (PE) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:117, and Plate 159), Patton Incised (PI) (Perttula et al. 2014), Poynor Engraved (PYE) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:123, and Plate 162), Ripley Engraved (RE) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:127, and Plate 164), Simms Engraved (SE) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:141, and Plate 171), Simms Incised (SI) (Perttula 2015a), Taylor Engraved (TE) (Suhm and Jelks 1962:149, 151, and Plates 175-176), Womack Engraved (WE) (Duffield and Jelks 1961), and Womack Plain (WP) (Perttula and Walters 2015). There are also eight arrow point types in the network, including Cuney (C) (Turner et al. 2011:187), Fresno (F) (Turner et al. 2011:191), Harrell (H) (Turner et al. 2011:196), Maud (M) (Turner et al. 2011:201), Nodena (N) (Justice 1987), Talco (T) (Turner et al. 2011:212), Turney (Tu) (Turner et al. 2011:214), and Perdiz (P) (Turner et al. 2011:206), as well as an unidentified straight stem (SS) projectile."
"29" "Historic Caddo Network Subcommunities (North)"
"30" "The Historic Caddo subcommunities defined in the northern part of  n ortheast Texas include 24 nodes (sites) connected by 198 edges of varying weights (Table 14.2 and Figure 14.5), representative of 50 percent of the nodes (sites) and 41.4 percent of the edges in the composite network. The modularity statistic segregated the network into three subcommunities based upon suites of  ceramic and lithic types: one primarily to the west of the region and along the Sabine River that may articulate with the Nadaco Caddo (Community 1), one in the northeast (Community 2) on the Red River and tributaries in the area of Nasoni Caddo settlements in the larger Kadohadaco area, and one in the southeast part of the region that also includes parts of the Sabine River (Community 3)."
"31" "Historic Caddo Network Subcommunities (South)"
"32" "The Historic Caddo communities identified in the southern parts of  n ortheast Texas include 23 nodes (sites) connected by 164 edges of varying weights (Table 14.3 and Figure 14.6), representative of 47.9 percent of the nodes (sites) and 34.3 percent of the edges in the composite network. The modularity statistic identified two subcommunities based on the ceramic and lithic types present. The  two  subcommunities occur in the Neches and Angelina River basins, and include Hasinai Caddo sites in the heart of  n ortheast Texas and upper Neches River basin Historic Caddo groups, perhaps the Nacachua or Nabiti Caddo (Swanton 1996)."
"33" "Discussion"
"34" "This exploratory network analysis posits potential contact and interaction between different Caddo groups across  n ortheast Texas based on the recovery of similar ceramic and lithic assemblages. Using the results of this exploratory network analysis as the basis for a series of subsequent confirmatory tests, interpretations that enlist these data can be strengthened, refined, and abandoned as needed."
"35" "Caddo Communities of Practice and Identit y"
"36" "Used in a variety of material culture studies, practice theory has been employed in studies of graffiti (Dhoop et al. 2016), stamp seals (Green 2016), ceramics (Cordell and Habicht-Mauche 2015; Eckert 2008; Eckert et al. 2015) and numerous other categories of material culture, including studies of the pedagogy of archaeology (Handley 2015). Eckert (2012:55) posited that communities of practice consist of social networks in which makers partake in a shared technological tradition. That tradition is culturally transmitted through various means: vertical, oblique transmission, master/apprentice transmission, or horizontal transmission (Hosfield 2009:46; Knappett 2011b:103). However, traditions of practice transcend specific social units (i.e., villages, cultures or ethnic groups) (Stark 2006:25), and three core characteristics must be understood to define communities of practice: mutual engagement, joint enterprise, and shared repertoire (Lyons and Clark 2012:27)."
"37" "It is worth noting that communities of identity differ from communities of practice in that they are social networks where makers share a group identity (Eckert 2008:3), and unlike communities of practice, where membership is often correlated to unconscious decisions, membership in a community of identity articulates with conscious production decisions that emphasize (or deemphasize) group membership (Eckert 2012:55). Depending upon contextual associations and assumed utility, the communities characterized in this exploratory network analysis could be interpreted as either communities of practice or identity. However, if it is assumed that the shape and form of arrow points, and the shape,  form, designs, and motifs associated with Historic Caddo ceramics represent the deliberate, and thoughtful, decisions of Caddo makers, then an interpretation that focuses on communities of identity may be more appropriate. Further, context is of particular importance, and should the artifacts have been recovered from burials, as is the case for much of Caddo material culture  in the archaeological record , framing our discussions in terms of communities of identity, rather than communities of practice, may provide more meaningful and conceptually consistent explanations."
"38" "Communities of identity have been ascribed in the past  to  recognized Caddo phases or aspects through the enlistment of co-presence observations associated with the many decorative attributes that adorn Caddo vessels, the semiotics of which occupy a special place at the core of Caddo ceramic taxonomy (Suhm and Jelks 1962; Suhm and Krieger 1954). The networks illustrate two communities and a possible spatial boundary that warrants additional testing (see Figure 14.4). This result appears to align particularly well with the Allen phase area in the south (Community 1), and the Kinsloe phase in the north (Community 2) (see Figure 14.4). Based on current knowledge regarding the distribution of Historic Caddo groups and defined phases, the area of the Sabine River north to the Red River were occupied by the Kadohadacho (Parsons et al. 2002; Perttula 2005; Scurlock 1965; Williams 1964) and related tribal groups. Clusters south of the Sabine River more readily articulate with locations of known Hasinai Caddo tribal groups (Eakin 1997; Kenmotsu 1992;  Marceaux 2007, 2011; Marceaux and Wade 2014; Mickle 1994; Middlebrook 2014; Wyckoff and Baugh 1980)."
"39" "The two subcommunities associated with Community 1 (south) overlap to some degree with sites from Anderson, Cherokee, Nacogdoches, and Smith counties in subcommunity 1, and other sites in Anderson, Houston, and Nacogdoches counties in subcommunity 2 (see Table 14.3). While common attributes (types) exist between both of these subcommunities, additional work is warranted to identify and clarify those  distinctive  characteristics that may be present. Community 2 (North) includes three subcommunities; one that is expressed throughout the full geographic range of the community (subcommunity 1), and two others that are present in the northeast (subcommunity 2) and southeast (subcommunity 3). Certainly ,  these results beg the question of whether, and to what extent, subcommunities 2 and 3 continue into  n orthwest Louisiana,  s outhwest Arkansas, and  s outheast Oklahoma."
"40" "There is overlap in the ceramic and lithic types present at some sites; however, the communities and subcommunities are defined by the proportions of types recovered from each location. This raises questions regarding whether and how the similarities and differences among those types found in Community 1 and Community 2 sites may be expressed grammatically through decorative attributes and motifs, as well as technological attributes. In addition to decorative and technological attributes, morphological differences are known to exist between and among artifacts found at Caddo sites and groups of sites that can be further explored through tests of ceramic (Selden 2017, 2018a, 201 8b, 2019 )  and lithic morphology (Selden et al. 2018). While current efforts to identify similarities and differences in Caddo ceramic and lithic shape, form, allometry, and asymmetry enlist geometric morphometrics (Selden et al. 2014), the initial push toward a more standardized and rigorous analysis of Caddo vessel shape began over 40 years ago (Turpin and Neely 1977; Turpin et al. 1976). This network analysis provides a useful exploratory framework that can be used to posit, then test, additional questions using geometric morphometrics."
"41" "Conclusion s"
"42" "This exploratory analysis of Historic Caddo networks demonstrates the potential for significant theoretical and interpretive gains through the employment of aggregated type data for Historic Caddo ceramics and arrow points in the ancestral Caddo territory. Aggregation and addition of those data associated with sherds, pipes, lithic and ceramic varieties, vessel shapes, and new discoveries may aid in further refining the current iteration of Historic Caddo networks by increasing their cultural resolution, and by providing additional insights into potential affiliations associated with each site. The analysis of the Historic Caddo network articulates well with practice theory, which is seen as a gainful interpretive tool through which to couch the results of future analyses."
"43" "Further work remains with regard to the production of a more holistic and inclusive network; however, this effort represents the beginning of a long-term research program aimed at exploring regional similarities in Caddo artifact assemblages throughout the Southern Caddo area. The production of exploratory network analyses for the Late, Middle, Early, and Formative Caddo  periods will aid in the continued refinement of this methodological approach, to include the confirmatory analyses that follow. None of the networks presented in this analysis are static, and each will continue to change as additional data and subsequent iterative improvements are incorporated."
