Abstract: What social processes guide the spread of ethnic or racial exclusion? I investigate the
diffusion of medieval expulsions of Jews from polities in the Holy Roman Empire. For medieval
rulers, religious and material concerns were strong rationales against expulsion. Yet expulsions
increase markedly in the fifteenth century. Did an expulsion by one government affect another
government’s choices about expulsion? Using event history analysis methods, I document the
limited spread of expulsion among over 500 polities in the western Holy Roman Empire, 13851520 CE. Temporal and spatial trends indicate that expulsions in politically and economically
powerful cities spurred expulsions generally but suppressed them nearby. The adoption of
expulsion followed political and economic incentives that were embedded in inter-city
relationships, particularly after theological changes gave expulsion fresh political value. Social
interdependence can spur as well as squelch racial extremism.

Governments are racialized organizations (Ray 2019). Ethnoracial exclusion and violence are
tools of governance (Bracey 2015) that performatively demonstrate legitimacy and pragmatically
protect privilege and inequality. At first brush, policies of exclusion would seem to be purely
domestic affairs, built on cultural legacies of difference. Yet contemporary history illustrates that
exclusion is not contained by borders. The past decade or so has seen a wave of racially
exclusive populism in Europe and the US. Beyond domestic contexts, relationships between
governments shape the consideration and then adoption of similar legislation (Glick and
Friedland 2014; Meyer et al. 1997), including policies of ethnoracial exclusion. Social diffusion
processes have eased the spread of racial extremist political parties (Rydgren 2005), fascism
(Weyland 2010), and techniques for repression (Olar 2019).
Whether oppressive and exclusionary behavior is internally driven or externally induced has
been a persistent theme in social science. We continue to have a pressing need to understand drift
to extreme behavior. In this paper, I investigate whether patterns of social influence can help
explain the incidence of medieval urban expulsions of Jews in German lands. Expulsions served
financial ends, performed Christian duty, and solved political problems (Dorin 2016; DotenSnitker forthcoming; Johnson and Koyama 2019; Müller 2002). Despite strong antisemitism,
expulsion was unattractive, but expulsion does appear to spread in the fifteenth century. Interpolity relationships might have provided the social inducement to overcome the disincentives to
expulsion. Oftentimes, policy diffusion is treated as a modern phenomenon, but there is nothing
inherently modern about political innovation and adoption or, for that matter, racial extremism.
Medieval German lands were dense with urban governments linked within a political culture that
drew governments together in associations rather than absolutist hierarchies (Hardy 2018). The
volume of urban governments creates an opportunity to study a racially extreme policy’s
2

diffusion in a much larger group than would be possible for most modern policies. Using
discrete-time event history analysis methods, I examine potential social processes for the
transmission of expulsion policies between cities in western German lands in the late medieval
era. I consider the role of universal mechanisms like observation of early adopters and
responding to religious change as well as how political and economic relationships segmented
incentives to expel or not. The foremost conclusion of this study is that policy change to enact
total exclusion is unlikely, even in the face of changing attitudes and cultural repertoires
(Lamont, Beljean, and Clair 2014; Swidler 1986), when social network incentives are against it.
When governments are politically and economically interdependent, their policies of ethnic and
racial inclusion or exclusion are linked as well.
BACKGROUND
Expulsions of Jews in Western Europe were sporadic before the 13th century. Whereas France
expelled all Jews off and on (1182, 1253, 1306, 1322, 1394, 1501) and England expelled Jews in
1290,1 Kaiser Friedrich I (Barbarossa) confirmed his Christian responsibility to protect those

Philip II of France expelled Jews from his personally-held territories in 1182 (Jordan 1989,
1998), with the next major expulsion in 1253 by Louis IX (Saint Louis), who expelled Jews from
French crown lands as part of his Crusade mission to protect Christian society (Stacey 1988).
Edward I of England expelled Jews from his French territory of Gascony in 1289 and then
England in 1290, ostensibly for religious reasons (Elukin 2007; Mundill 1998; Stow 2007) and
likely for institutional control (Barkey and Katznelson 2011; Katznelson 2005; Koyama 2010).
Philip IV expelled the Knights Templar from French crown lands in 1305 and Jews in 1306, both
to stabilize royal finances after mismanagement and to assert the crown’s right to control
populations in baronial lands (Jordan 1998). Jews were invited back to France, then expelled
again in 1322 (Jordan 1989; Stow 1992) and 1394 (Nirenberg 1996) and 1501 (Stow 1992), with
limited resettlement each time. Jews were kept out of England until the 17th century.

who were faithful to the traditions of their fathers 2 in Iudaeis nostris Ratisponensibus after the
1182 French expulsion. Generations of German kings followed suit, affirming Jewish rights as
part of the spectacle of coronation. In German cities and principalities, Jews made contracts for
their protection and gained citizenship rights (Haverkamp 1999). Yet the number of German
expulsions climbed considerably in the fifteenth century (Haverkamp 2002).
Although the general norm in medieval Germany was non-expulsion, city rulers did have reasons
to ignore it, based on what meaning they put on having Jewish residents. One view of Jews was
that they were a financial asset to be exploited and manipulated to maximize rulers’ incomes
(Levi 1983; Olson 1993), including via contributing to the commercial and fiscal health of
polities (Finley and Koyama 2018; Ries 1995; Scholl 2015). Understanding Jews as a financial
resource is the dominant explanation in economic history for expulsions (Barzel 1992; Koyama
2010; Stacey 1997; Wenninger 1981). There were long-term benefits to maintaining a Jewish
community because city rulers could gain permission from the German emperor to levy special
taxes on Jews.3 Religious difference enabled rulers to develop financially exploitative policies
(Johnson and Koyama 2019) that larger and more powerful Christian populations could
effectively rebel against, 4 but Jewish communities were smaller, with limited legal recourse.
However, if rulers’ primary orientation was towards short-term financial gain from Jews, then

Ancestry has long been connected to understandings of peoplehood in Europe. In medieval
Europe, Jewish blood made someone Jewish (Nirenberg 2009), though stereotypical (Weeda
2014) cultural and linguistic behaviors were the evidence of innate Jewishness (Bartlett 2001;
Stow 2001). For a masterful study of racialization in medieval Europe, consult Heng (2018).
3 Like most privileges, permission to tax Jewish residents would be granted for a specific period
of time, such as five or ten years. For example, in 1413 Constance was leased the right to collect
and pocket half an imperial tax on the city’s Jews for 12 years (Hagen 2018).

expulsion could be anytime, as it would be an opportunity to confiscate Jews’ properties and
other assets. If anything, there was demand for Jewish residents, and competition over who held
the rights over their residency and taxes. Generally, expulsions for economic predation should be
isolated transgressions of the non-expulsion norm.
A second way Christian rulers interpreted the presence of Jews in their cities is that Jews were an
asset for Christian social order. Christianity-influenced beliefs declared that a good community
included Jews because a) God had made a covenant with them, and thus they were the
forebearers and partial inheritors of the promised apocalyptic Kingdom of God and b) they were
an example and contrast for Christians, who should behave more righteously than Jews
(Battenberg 1987; Laux 2010; Stacey 1992; Stow 1992, 2007). In theological constancy with
Christian forefathers Paul and Augustine by viewing Jews as witnesses representing a pre-Christ
relationship to God, popes proclaimed that the Church protected Jewish practice by Jews (Stow
2007). These rulers should be sensitive to changes in the perception that Jews are part of
properly ordered Christian communities, ending Jewish residency in their cities when these
beliefs change. In fact, such a change did occur in religious meaning. While the Church held its
position, some theological innovators began to conceive of the relationship with Jews as a moral
threat for Christians (Luzzati 1999). From the fifteenth century the canonical ban on usury5 was

Demanding interest from the poor is forbidden in the Pentateuch (Exodus 22:25-27, Leviticus
25:35-38, Deuteronomy 23:19, 20, 24:6) and in the writings of the prophets. It is not expressly
discussed in the New Testament by Jesus or the first apostles. Ambrose of Milan (339-97 CE)
and his protégé Augustine (354-430 CE) both condemned lending at any interest. Contained in
the laws of the Second Council of Lyon (1274) was Usurarum voraginem, an outline of the
consequences for princes’ toleration of usury, profit by excessive interest on loans. There was no
specific threshold past which interest became excessive. The judgement of whether an amount of
interest was usurious was subjective. On medieval Jewish thinking about lending at interest, see
Joseph Shatzmiller (1989), Shylock Reconsidered: Jews, Moneylending, and Medieval Society.

applied also to Jews (Dorin 2015, 2016), and church reform in the fifteenth century made Jewish
financial activities a frequent reason for expulsion (Cluse 1999). This suggests that explanations
and analyses should attend to whether expulsions follow a pattern of social influence spreading
concerns about public morality.
A third meaning for Christian rulers is that resident Jews were a political asset. For one thing,
Jews were convenient scapegoats. They were blamed for disturbances or social problems, from
pandemics to economic crises (Anderson, Johnson, and Koyama 2017; Cluse and Müller 2009;
Haverkamp 2004; Jedwab, Johnson, and Koyama 2019). Mistreatment by the government,
including imprisonment and execution, 6 could mollify an agitated Christian population by
demonstrating that rulers were taking action to address popular concerns. Performative
antisemitism during Christian holy times (Nirenberg 1996) demonstrated city leaders’ Christian
bona fides and deservingness as rulers. Rulers distanced themselves from the burdens of their
government via policies that raised taxes on Jews, who then had to pass along increased costs of
business to their mostly middle- and lower-class customers (Gilomen 2009). Because Jews
became intermediaries, and because rights to “protect” 7 (and therefore tax) them was farmed out,
there is a nesting doll-quality for maintaining or expelling a Jewish community. If someone else
had claim over the local Jews, the Jews became a liability and a siphon for someone else’s fiscal
capacity. City rulers who lacked legal and economic control over the local Jews might expel the

Imprisonments and executions during the Black Death plague of 1348-1351 were the most
numerous, but they were by no means the only episodes of violent scapegoating. For narrative
details of several examples, consult Germania Judaica (e.g., Würzburg in 1400, Constance in
1443).
7 “Protecting” Jews meant little more than exercising mastership over them. As a legal concept, it
included responsibilities, but more importantly it included rights. As a corollary, in the modern
world we still debate how much a government can extract from or monitor its citizens and how
much it is responsible to provide them.

Jews to dodge indirect taxation and intervention in their affairs by another political elite. The
question here is whether some broader political concerns linked cities in such a way that
expulsion could spread between them.
THEORY
Prior studies of medieval European expulsions have investigated expulsion as a domestic
process, but of course policy decisions are a product of both domestic and external factors
(Myers 2000; Shipan and Volden 2008). By external factors, I mean the social structures and
relationships that influence rulers’ choices (Burt 1987; Hedstrom, Sandell, and Stern 2000;
Strang 1991; Wurpts, Corcoran, and Pfaff 2018). There are two ways to think about social
influence. The first, what successfully propagates new behavior?, is the most common within the
significant literature on policy diffusion (Dobbin, Simmons, and Garrett 2007; Gilardi and
Wasserfallen 2019). Framing the question in this way is especially useful for thinking about prosocial policies that one wants to spread. The second, what constrains and prevents new
behavior? (Clemens and Cook 1999; Darwich 2017), is a useful reframing, especially with a
corollary what constraints fail when a new behavior is propagated? Truly, there are two
phenomena at issue: the predominance of the status quo plus a fraction that diverges to expel.
From this vantage, we see that to understand the uptick in expulsions, we must think about social
influence as factors about the anti-expulsion norm and sanctions for violating it as well as
relational factors that can moderate the norm or sanction or else magnify the domestic incentives
to transgress. In medieval German lands, non-expulsion was socially reinforced via economic
and political sanctions. Expulsion might attract punishment via fines or siege by the Holy Roman

7

Emperor,8 to whom Jews ultimately legally belonged. Regional political alliances (Bünde)
included directives about protecting Jews (Scholl 2012), and they, too, assessed fines as well as
suspended members for violence against Jews (Hagen 2018). Punishments were in service of the
peace of the land because expulsion was disruptive to the broader political and economic
community. Politically, because Jews were understood to be caught within the intricate web of
dominion rights, expulsion was an aggression against often-fragile relationships between
political elites; there was particular fear that an uprising within a city, which might expel or
murder Jews, would spread to other cities (Scholl 2012). Economically, expelling Jews
interrupted local commerce, both because a portion of the local economy disappeared and
because Jewish moneylenders closing shop meant that necessary access to credit was restricted,
predominantly for middle- and lower-class Christians (Botticini 2000; Gilomen 2009). Local
commercial interruptions could easily balloon into regional hiccups. Further, if a polity expelled
its Jewish residents, a nearby authority might offer Jews residency to bolster their own finances.
The Bishop of Metz did exactly this after the Archbishop of Trier expelled Jews from his
territories in 1418 (Haverkamp 1999). The fifteenth-century expulsions in the Holy Roman
Empire represent the failure of sanctioning threats, the failure of expulsion to be seen as toxic to
peace in the land, and overall the failure of the norm against the removal of Jews.
What corroded these checks on expulsion? One view is to focus on the usefulness of expulsion as
a technology of governance. If expulsion is technologically effective, it should grow in
popularity as cities are exposed to the idea or observe its usefulness in other cities (Gilardi and

Cities like Cologne were called on by the emperor to account for their expulsions or failures to
intervene against violence (Rubin 1995). Several cities were fined for pogroms at the time of the
Black Death.

Radaelli 2012; Shipan and Volden 2008; Volden, Ting, and Carpenter 2008). Especially when a
political behavior is relatively untested or materially risky (Olar 2019), political actors might
value reassurance from observing others (Becker 1970) they perceive to face similar institutional
realities (Greve, Kim, and Teh 2016; Horowitz 2010; Linebarger 2016). It should not spread if it
is not useful. Gilardi, Shipan, and Wueest (forthcoming) find that interpreting a new policy as
technologically efficacious prompts the diffusion of the policy. However, in this case, expulsion
was not a new technology; expulsions had been occurring in Europe in previous centuries,
including a few within the Holy Roman Empire. The technological meaning of Jews, that they
were a tool for government finance, was settled. If cities expelled Jews in a wave based on the
confiscatory benefits, then the underlying issue would be some temporally-specific financial
shock, and we might expect it to be relatively widespread.
Another possibility is that expulsion spread because it was imbued with new social meaning
(Bail, Brown, and Wimmer 2019; Koenig and Dierkes 2011; Sikkink 2014). Who else does it
first tells city rulers something about why they should expel, beyond the material meaning. When
we consider doing something new that we know has significant drawbacks, we sometimes look
to our closest friends and neighbors (Hadden and Jasny 2019; McAdam 1986) or to thought
leaders (DeMora, Collingwood, and Ninci 2019; Watts and Dodds 2007), whose adoption of a
new behavior gives social desirability or credibility to it (Abrutyn, Mueller, and Osborne 2019;
Brown 2019). Expulsion might become a process of isomorphism (Clemens and Cook 1999;
DiMaggio and Powell 1983), with rulers imitating a political feature without respect to material
incentives. For example, a shift in the Christian religious meaning of Jews that rejected their coresidence in European Christendom could prompt a sea-change. The Council of Constance,
which met 1414-1418 in Constance in modern southern Germany, debated the Christian
9

understanding of Jews as part of its overall mission to unify Christendom against heterodoxy
(Grayzel 1967:302–4; Housley 2017).9 The annunciation of a new crusade against the Hussite
sect and heretics in Europe and simultaneous call for all Christian rulers to exercise Christian
dominion through orthodox purity in belief and behavior (Blickle 1992; Housley 2017; Rubin
1999) gave expulsion not only new religious meaning but new political meaning. This change
both incentivized expulsion and diminished the threat of sanctions for it. Thus, we might expect
that expulsions increased particularly after 1418, and perhaps also most of all nearer to
Constance, as news spread and Council attendees returned to their cities. Other fifteenth- and
sixteenth-century social changes likewise appear to have radiated from their epicenters (Cantoni
2012; Dittmar 2011; Rubin 2014). It also seems plausible that religious cities like the seats of
bishops and archbishops would be early adopters after the Council of Constance.
Social structure itself might also be important for the spread or containment of expulsion (Bail et
al. 2019; Centola 2015; Reagans and McEvily 2003; Watts and Strogatz 1998). Social structure
segments economic and political concerns, so we should expect that social structure segments the
interpretation and adoption of expulsion. I already noted that politically prominent cities were in
regular communication to coordinate their affairs, which they formalized in Bund treaties. Bünde
could try to prevent expulsions, but they might also reinforce defection from the anti-expulsion
norm. These cities shared the political goal of preserving their governments from interference,
whether by the emperor, princes, or popular uprisings. With the new political meaning
originating in early fifteenth-century discussions about whether a good Christian government

For the previous several decades, Latin Christendom had two rival popes, and recently a third
rival was elected. The disarray was religious and geopolitical, as each pope had different royal
supporters, and the continent had pressing geopolitical squabbles that required a Christian
authority to resolve them.

tolerated non-Christian belief and behavior, expulsion became politically attractive among these
cities. Expulsion sent a challenge to the imperial political system (Evers 2017) that privileged the
major noble families. Relationships among autonomy-seeking cities, united in their political
structural equivalence (Centola 2015), might propagate this new political meaning as well as
confer reassurance and a sense of belonging or identity (Acharya 2011; Meyer et al. 1997) about
transgressing. Pragmatically, the potential costs of rebellion were diminished (Dixon and
Roscigno 2003) as powerful peers expelled first, and they might even provide martial support
against military intervention by the emperor.
Political prominence in medieval Germany was difficult to disentangle from economic
prominence, just like in the contemporary world. The regional political economy functioned as a
network of urban hubs plus their hinterlands (Eiden and Irsigler 2000; Sassen 2006, 2014;
Snyder and Kick 1979), providing spatial structure to economic and social relations. Thus the
economic and political incentives to expel, as well as tolerance to the disincentives, were
spatially distributed. More economically stable autonomous cities (Chilosi and Volckart 2011)
were nearby to smaller, less developed cities, who had greater economic interest in preserving
Jewish communities and political aversion (as well as reduced agency) to commit a political
transgression. Expulsion might actually relocate Jews to smaller places where they were under
more direct control of territorial lords who held rights over them, as happened in Cologne in
1424 when the city expelled its Jews, who were technically under the dominion of the
Archbishop of Cologne (Wenninger 1981). The interaction of the political meaning of expulsion
with economic incentives could produce a bull’s-eye pattern of expulsions in prominent cities
surrounded by cities that do not expel.

11

Alternatively, spatial patterns to expulsion might be the product of information networks.
Information networks carry details about why new behaviors and ideas are attractive or
unattractive. Until the advent of modern video and internet-based media, information networks
were highly correlated with transit routes. Transit connections have been a determinant in the
spread of political movements, from 19th century riots in England (Aidt, Leon, and Satchell
2018) to political Islam and the Muslim Brotherhood in 20th century Egypt (Brooke and Ketchley
2018). In the medieval world, information traveled via letters and travelers. Transit networks that
carried letters, people, and regular commercial exchange are a hybrid of geographic and social
structure. Information about expulsion surely moved unevenly in German lands, and so perhaps
expulsion was adopted unevenly based on incorporation into transit networks.
Social adoption of expulsion appears to be a likely channel for why the frequency of expulsion
increased in the fifteenth century. Medieval cities were relatively interdependent. They could not
enforce Christian financial piety unless their neighbors also did. Most of them were not prepared
to raise serious challenges to their position in the political system unless others did. And
expulsions were specifically a policy that moved taxable workers into another’s domain; cities
would not want to adopt a materially damaging behavior without social reinforcement
(Iannaccone 1992, 1994). Which, if any, of the social processes discussed above pushed
expulsion from a sporadic to a consistent threat for Jewish communities?
MEASUREMENT AND METHODOLOGY
Measuring this phenomenon requires data on Jewish settlement and expulsions for a large
proportion of the political units in medieval Europe where Jews lived. Geschichte der Juden im
Mittelalter von der Nordsee bis zu den Südalpen (Haverkamp 2002) covers the Rhineland and

12

environs, instead of the whole continent, for the period 1000CE-1520 CE. However, unlike
Encyclopedia Judaica, the other historical catalog of Jewish communities, it does cover all cities,
from the smallest to the biggest, within its geographical scope. After translating and digitizing
the gazetteer, I recoded and reorganized the data from half-century period-based observations
into annual observations of each city. Cities are included only for years of certain Jewish
presence. I elect to limit the temporal scope of these analyses to 1385-1520 CE for historical and
methodological reasons. Expulsions were extremely limited before the fifteenth century; the first
notable expulsion was in 1390 from the Prince-Electorate of Pfalz. The institution of the first
Judenschuldentilgung, an empire-wide transfer of debts to Jews to cities and King Wenceslaus,
in 1385 would be a potential hinge in the political and economic interpretation of Jewish
residents (Hagen 2018:229). Methodologically, choosing 1385 as a starting year includes ample
time and observations to detect temporal dependencies.
Expulsion orders could cover territories or individual cities. Here, I measure the occurrence of an
expulsion at the city level and refer to these expulsions as local expulsions. I code each city as
having no expulsion (0) or a local expulsion (1) in a year. I localize territorial expulsions by
coding their occurrence in the city that is the territorial prince’s residence.10 All told, the sample
includes 36,182 city-year observations. Figure 1 maps the spatial distribution of cities where
Jews lived and cities that expelled Jews. Within this region, Jews lived in 578 cities, and they
were victims of 105 local expulsions.

One territorial expulsion (Bayern-Landshut, 1450) is omitted from analysis because the
territorial seat (Landshut) did not have any Jewish residents and is therefore not in Geschichte
der Juden.

Diffusion
In order to account for processes of observation or learning, sociologists often expand the
window of how long we expect it to take for some behavior to be adopted. Hedström (1994),
Andrews and Biggs (2006), and Braun (2011) use the count of events N in the polities j (which is
the sample excluding city i) in the previous time period as a general contagion measure. I have
calculated this for my dataset for a range of period lengths. The main results use a 10-year lag

14

(see table 1 for descriptive statistics), while analyses in the online appendix add two other prior
period lengths.

Historical research suggests that the Council of Constance shifted religious and political
perceptions of Jewish subjects. We can contrast observations before and after 1418 through
binary categorization as well as observe the proportion of expulsion that occurred in the years
immediately following the Council. To measure the spatial relationship to Constance, I
calculated least-cost paths along trade and transit routes, specifically the late medieval
pilgrimage road network compiled by Bossak and Welford (2015) and the network of European
rivers in Natural Earth II (version 4.1.0). After some preprocessing in QGIS (see online
appendix), the network distances to Constance in kilometers were obtained through the
riverdist R package (Tyers 2017).
The city catalog of Geschichte der Juden lists a wide range of information about city political
and economic histories. Relevant for this study’s main purposes, I coded city dominion – who
held rights of rule in the city. Using this data, I can explore whether expulsions spread after the
Council of Constance within cities under religious rulers (under the dominion of an archbishop
or bishop, or whether a city was the seat of an archbishopric or bishopric). A competing
explanation is that expulsion spread among autonomy-seeking cities, who shared a political
structural position, so I record which cities were free cities that formally held rights of selfgovernments as well as which cities were imperial cities that were under the direct authority of
the Holy Roman Emperor.

15

Figure 2. Jewish Settlement and Expulsion in German Cities, 1000-1520 CE
Note. The sudden drop in circa 1350 is due to an epidemic of the Bubonic plague. Besides dying
from this pestilence, Jewish communities were also targets of pogroms where rumors blamed the
plague on Jews.
To directly assess whether expulsions compounded among these groups, I modify the diffusion
metric to create Dif2i: the count of events N within group G across a sample in the previous time
period, where g is the same for the city i and its alter cities j. For groups, I match a city to those
that shared its dominion type in the previous period (here, 10 years). If the ruler of city i was a
bishop, then Dif2i is calculated as the count of expulsions N in other cities j that were also ruled
by a bishop.

Above I argued that the incentives to expel were not evenly spatially distributed, and I offered a
few reasons why expulsions might be spatially isolated. I calculated least-cost paths along transit
routes between all cities. Following Braun (2011) and Hedström (1994), for each year I summed
the distances to expulsions Dij, then took the square root. I inverted this and multiplied by the
number of expulsions, after which I summed in ten-year moving windows. This is a
spatiotemporal lag (Beck, Gleditsch, and Beardsley 2006) by definition. The count of expulsions
N can again be restricted to those in a group G, as with Dif2, and I calculate three versions of
Dif3: among episcopal cities (ruled by a bishop or archbishop), among free or imperial cities, and
generically among all cities. Values increase with closer expulsions11 or with a greater number of
expulsions in the previous years at a consistent distance.

Political associations might have dampened the spread of expulsions by sanctioning cities that
shirked their responsibilities for public peace. For each city, I calculate the cumulative count of
Bund agreements a city had concluded in prior years, based on Distler’s (2006) list of Bünde and
their city signatories.

The exception here is that recent expulsions in the same city i are dropped because their
distance is 0 km. The importance of prior expulsions in city i is measured directly, as explained
later.
11

17

My naïve alternative is whether expulsion was simply a function of integration into the region.
To measure access to networks that might spread information about expulsion, I include the
count of roads and rivers passing through a city. Counts of routes were calculated using the R
package raster (Hijmans 2019) and a 5 km threshold to the pilgrimage road network and
Natural Earth II rivers. Using the count of routes captures variation in incorporation into the
information network. Most cities were on at least one travel route; some were on as many is 13
routes.

City-level variables
The city-level political economic incentives for and against expulsion are not the main focus of
this paper. Anderson, Johnson, and Koyama (2017), Finley and Koyama (2018), and DotenSnitker (forthcoming) have investigated domestic incentives for adopting the policy of expulsion.
Here, I include city-level factors from these prior studies, again coded from the city catalog in
Geschichte der Juden. These include political institutions, economic development and
institutions, and Christian and Jewish religious development. Descriptive statistics are in table 2.

18

Additionally, time is included as a categorical effect through 15-year dummies, which splits the
period into nine equal categories that do not overlap with any of the temporal variables.
I operationalize political authority in several ways. Besides the binary categorizations for
religious rule and autonomy, I also code whether dominion rights were held by a prince. A city
might be under the dominion of several types of rulers; I measure the potential for political
competition and volatility as the count of authorities over a city. Additionally, I include the
presence (1) or absence (0) of Schöffen as a governing body in the city. A college of Schöffen
was a quasi-legal body (Isenmann 2012) charged with maintaining public order (Börner 2010).
Domestic economic incentives for and against expulsion center on a city’s economic
opportunities and how city authorities could collect funds. A general metric for economic
development was commercial development, and I construct an ordinal measure of market
activity (no markets (0), one market or a generic record of market rights (1), multiple markets
(2), any number of fairs (3)). To capture the impact of alternative financial resources to
confiscation from or exploitation of Jewish communities, I include the presence (1) or absence
(0) of foreign merchants and rights to mint coins.
Finally, I measure aspects of communal religious life. I construct a cumulative index of Jewish
community infrastructure, counting how many types of infrastructure a Jewish community had
(synagogue, cemetery, mikveh, Jewish quarter) on a scale from 0 to 4. To approximate the local
inter-religious history, I measure the incidence of both prior expulsions and prior persecutions in
a city.

Statistical method
Event history analysis is a common method for explaining trends in political action, among other
phenomena. Its applications range from racial riots (Braun 2011; Myers 2010) to the founding of
ethnic newspapers (Olzak and West 1991) and labor organizations (Hedstrom et al. 2000) to the
adoption of laws internationally (Berliner 2014; Dawson and Swiss forthcoming) and in the
United States (Bricker and LaCombe 2020). Based on hazard models, it captures the temporal
span until an event happens—how long something survives or how long it takes for something to
happen after a catalytic event. The dependent variable is the hazard, or rate, of something
happening after a length of time. When events are observed in longer, discrete periods, such as in
years instead of days or months, discrete-time methods are appropriate. Discrete-time event
history analysis amounts to using odds ratios instead of hazard rates; this is the same as
performing logistic regression. Functionally, the model includes both (a) individual unit-level

20

factors and (b) a diffusion hazard, which can be spatially and temporally adjusted (Strang and
Tuma 1993).
Modeling a binary outcome can be difficult in social scientific studies, since we often have many
independent or control variables. A complicated right side of a logistic regression model is likely
to produce separation in the binary outcome. The co-occurrence of a few conditions will be
associated only with 1’s, while the co-occurrence of others will be associated only with 0’s, and
the predicted probabilities under standard logistic regression models will be 1 and 0,
respectively, resulting in overestimation of coefficients for logistic regressions of rare events or
failure to converge. Because the dependent variable of expulsion is a rare event (105 of 36,182
observations) and compounded by the fact that many of the independent variables are binary as
well as sparsely distributed, I use a Bayesian logistic regression, as proposed by Gelman, Jakulin,
Pittau, and Su (2008).
A Bayesian model requires the specification of a prior probability distribution, meaning an
assumption or guess about what the distribution of the outcome data is, and updates this prior
distribution through checking the sample data. The updated information about variable
distributions, or the posterior distribution, is then used in the regression. Instead of treating the
patterns observed in the sample as “truth,” a Bayesian regression introduces uncertainty around
the sample distributions, with the results that separation is less likely and model convergence
more likely.
In the case of a rare event, Gelman et al. (2008) and others (Betancourt 2017; Stan Development
Team 2018b) argue for standardizing non-binary variables around 0 and rescaling to a standard
deviation of 0.5 before using the weakly informative (Lemoine 2019; McElreath 2016) Student’s

21

t distribution (df=7, scale=2.5) for prior probability distributions. With the rstanarm package
2.18.2 (Stan Development Team 2018a) for R, I estimate Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian
hierarchical logistic regressions, with random effects for periodized settlement observations
(since several covariates are period-based) nested within settlements. I use random effects
because I am not interested in explaining effects of particular settlements, only in minimizing the
influence of correlated errors within settlements. I use the Student’s half-t distribution (df=4,
scale=1) for weakly informative prior probability distributions for the intercepts (Gelman 2006).
To obtain posterior probability distributions, for each model specification I iterated through 5
independent chains 5,000 times each, starting with 2,500 warm-up iterations per chain. Full
model details and diagnostic checks are described in the online appendix. Diagnostics did not
detect any problematic behavior.
RESULTS
Table 3 displays the main event history analysis results using the rescaled sample data under six
model specifications. Results are robust to varying the temporal window from 10 years to 5 years
and to 20 years; a description of these additional analyses are in the online appendix. Bayesian
regression analyses produce posterior distributions for each component of a model that represent
the joint distribution of the independent and dependent variables based on the observed data and
the prior distributions provided by the analyst. Posterior medians and standard errors are
analogous to regular logistic regression coefficients and their standard errors. Here, because of
how the sample data were rescaled, for continuous variables the posterior median represents the
effect of a 2-standard-error increase in the variable value instead of a one-unit increase. Since
logistic regressions produce values showing change in log-odds, which can be difficult to

22

interpret, Figure 3 translates these values visually into changes in probabilities and credibility
intervals for the main diffusion-related variables for each model. Credibility intervals capture a
set percent of the density of a posterior distribution. They function similarly to confidence
intervals. Following McElreath (2016), I illustrate 89% credibility intervals, as well as 50%
intervals. The coefficients from logistic regressions are conditional on which other variables are
included, so it is unwise to compare magnitudes across models (Breen, Karlson, and Holm
2018).
Model 1 focuses on the potential impact of observing other cities expel or not expel. The results
indicate that observing recent expulsions (Dif1) did play a determining role in the spread of
expulsions, once other factors are accounted for – in this specification, expulsions were less
likely when other cities had recently expelled Jews. The odds of expulsion were 49% lower when
the count of expulsions in the previous 10 years was two standard deviations below (0
expulsions12) the mean (6.97 expulsions). The pattern is the opposite of the expected temporal
spike in expulsions, if cities were observing and learning about the technical utility of expulsion.
Further, the results here do not provide evidence that participating in regional alliances provided
social reinforcement for expelling or for non-expulsion. This model hints at why expulsions
never occurred at a high rate or spread widely, and the rest of the model specifications help us
pull apart what was happening in more detail.

Technically, two standard deviations below the mean of Dif1 is less than 0, but that is
impossible, and I substitute 0 here.

In model 2, I added one temporal and one spatial measure of the importance of Christian
religious changes inaugurated by the Council of Constance. Coarsely, I divided observations to
those after the Council versus not. Most expulsions occurred afterwards, and the event history
analysis results confirm a strong relationship. At the same time, the Dif1 temporal relationship
disappears. Additionally, the negative relationship between expulsions and distance from
Constance appears to substantiate the hypothesis that expulsion spread outwards from Constance.
However, there is no evidence that episcopal rulers were the more likely adopters of this new
behavior. Indeed, none of the models presented here validate that idea. Model 3 demonstrates
this most clearly. I disaggregated the temporal lag into two versions of Dif2, one tracing the
number of prior expulsions among cities ruled by bishops or archbishops and one tracing the
number of prior expulsions among free or imperial cities. The model 3 results do not provide
evidence that expulsion spread among either of these groups of cities or that expulsions among
either of these groups catalyzed wider adoption of expulsion among other cities.
The results for model 4 demonstrate that multiple mechanisms jointly produce the spread of
expulsion among some cities and the suppression of expulsion among others. In model 4, I
included the same Dif2 measures as in model 3, but this time I also included the spatial
adjustments of Dif3. That is, I modeled the probability of expulsion in relationship to other
cities’ behavior and their proximity. The results show three important features. First, expulsion
was more likely when free or imperial cities had done so recently. For observations two standard
deviations above the mean (3.72), the odds of expulsion were 136% greater than observations at
the mean (0.52). Second, expulsions were less likely in cities nearby to the expelling free or
imperial cities. Dif3 increases with more expulsions and with greater proximity to expulsions.
For a city whose Dif3 value in a year is two standard deviations above (0.56) the mean (0.6), the

odds of expulsion are 56% lower. Third, distance to Constance remains important even after
including these other layers of temporal and spatial measures; cities nearer to Constance were
more likely to expel their Jewish residents. Additionally, I included interactions between each
Dif2 temporal measure and dummy variables for whether a city was of that same type, which
detects whether episcopal cities, or free or imperial cities, responded differently to expulsions in
cities of their same type than did other cities. I find no evidence for a difference in temporal
effects.

27

Models 5 and 6 explore the limits of these results. Model 5 omits distance to Constance and
swaps a universal Dif3, distance-adjusted prior expulsions, for the group-specific Dif3 measures
in model 4. The negative relationship with this universal Dif3, now the only spatial independent
variable, plus the non-importance of Dif2 for free or imperial cities, the one temporal measure,
underscores the role of space in German expulsions of Jews. Model 6 reverts to the universal
Dif1 and assesses whether spatial patterns were the effect of information networks and transit
access. The effect of lagged, distance-scaled expulsions persists, and there is no evidence that
incorporation in the region via transit routes 13 or treaties had anything to do with expulsions.
Regarding the local incentives for expulsion, this study mostly agrees with others that stress
domestic political economy. Across the model specifications, Jews were more vulnerable to
expulsion in cities where there were foreign moneylenders and where there was a local mint,
both sources of city funding. Expulsions happened less often in cities run by boards of jurists
(Schöffen). Each city had its own arrangements of political power and economic development.
Expulsions were undertaken in the midst of struggles over authority and legitimacy (DotenSnitker forthcoming; Finley and Koyama 2018; Johnson and Koyama 2019) that were more
endogenous to some institutional arrangements than others. Once these institutional contexts and
the social factors between cities are accounted for, the types of parties to dominion over a city
did not matter. Expulsion was not more common among imperial cities, as observed in DotenSnitker (forthcoming), Finley and Koyama (2018), and Voigtländer and Voth (2012), or among

Nor was the comparative rarity of expulsion an effect of a lack of awareness about the policy
idea. Roads and rivers crisscrossed the western Holy Roman Empire. The median distance for a
sample city to a road was 3.6 kilometers, less than an hour’s walk; the median distance to a river
or road is even closer, at 2.3 kilometers. Couriers were known to travel up to 65 kilometers in a
day (Kreutz 2005).

bishoprics and archbishoprics. Trends support the conclusion that local conditions for adoption
of expulsion were the prevailing concern for cities, rather than social transmission.
The results also point to patterns in local interreligious cultures. Cities with more prior
persecutions were more likely to expel their Jewish residents, as were cities with more Jewish
community infrastructure. I cannot tell from these data and methods whether the relationship
between Jewish community development and expulsions is one of community size and therefore
visibility as religious others or valuable confiscable assets. The relationship between Jewish
community features and their treatment by their neighbors is a good avenue for future research,
as more contemporary investigations about minority groups provide several hypotheses about
whether contact, visibility, or economics drive exclusion and targeted political violence.
DISCUSSION
In medieval German cities there was a norm against expelling Jewish communities. This study
presents evidence that religious change and spatially-structured economic and political incentives
unraveled this norm. Whereas the scholarly literature on medieval expulsions of Jews offers rich
detail about individual cases and broader historical developments in antisemitism, this article
branches out to consider whether urban expulsions were interdependent. I reveal the relational
influences that facilitated the increase in expulsions in the fifteenth century.
I find that observing other cities’ expulsions did not universally accelerate the spread of
expulsions in the fifteenth century, when the policy was most frequent. For medieval German
cities as a whole, expulsion was of limited value. We see this in the infrequency of expulsion, in
the segmenting of expulsion among cities with particular political economies, and in the spatial
structure of expulsions. By comparison, Cantoni (2012) concluded that the Protestant
29

Reformation spread in the sixteenth century via proximity to Wittenberg, the residence of Martin
Luther. Likewise, Dittmar (2011) and Rubin (2014) argue that printing with a press and
associated societal changes spread outward from Mainz, where the printing press was invented
circa 1440. Expulsions of Jews did not begin with some small group of adopting cities and ripple
out across the realm. The disadvantages of expulsion suppressed any potential norm cascade
(Macy et al. 2019; Marwell and Oliver 1993; Watts 2002) effects.
Religious change gave new social meaning to expulsion beyond its use as a fiscal tool. With
theological developments at the Council of Constance, the Christian religious understanding of
Jews evolved to see Jews as a moral threat, moderating one constraint on cities’ exclusionary
antisemitism. Expulsions were more common closer to Constance and only became a relatively
regular occurrence from the 1420s, as the crusade against the Hussites was established and the
theocratic ideas debated at the Council were promulgated. Church leaders did not drive this
trend, though. I find no evidence that bishops and archbishops expelled Jews from their cities
first, nor that episcopal rulers were especially likely to expel Jews at all. These results reinforce
the argument that the new emphasis on theocracy in the fifteenth century undermined the Latin
Church’s monopoly on religious authority (Blickle 1992; Doten-Snitker forthcoming), laying the
groundwork for the sixteenth century’s religious warfare.
If religious change created an opportunity to defect from the norm of non-expulsion, structural
inequalities within the political and economic system shaped which city governments opted for
expulsion. I find that expulsions by autonomy-hungry free and imperial cities precipitated
growth in the number of expulsions, demonstrating that the social meaning of expulsion gained a
new political dimension. These cities were politically well-integrated and relatively powerful.
Expulsion asserted their autonomy from the German emperor or other political elites who may
30

have held rights over the Jews in their midst. Like the ambitious governments in the US South
that intervened in mob violence (Beck, Tolnay, and Bailey 2016), for these city governments
expulsion fit with their political self-image and their relative power. Cities politically dependent
on a prince or territorial lord may not have felt like they could risk what could be perceived of as
interference in the rights and economic interests of their overlords.
Of course, expulsion was also differentially risky economically, which the bull’s-eye spatial
pattern picks up. I find that expulsion in free or imperial cities suppressed expulsion in nearby
cities. Political independence and economic independence were intertwined, particularly in the
early fifteenth century (Chilosi and Volckart 2011) as expulsion increased. Politically
independent cities were also more economically independent cities at the center of more
agrarian, more volatile hinterlands. They could weather the budgetary losses that resulted from
removing a portion of their population, whose existence and economic activity they taxed. In
fact, the negative spatial pattern in this study is consistent with the interpretation that expulsion
displaced Jews into cities that benefited from and valued their new residents economically.
Unfortunately, we only have some records of the localities in which displaced Jews resettled, 14
but at least some did move only a short distance. The social and internal constraints on expulsion
persisted among smaller dependencies, but were loosened for cities with greater political and
economic privileges.
In an attempt to rule out more simple alternatives, I also examined whether more generic
exposure-based effects explain the limited spread of expulsions. I find evidence that an expulsion

14

31

anywhere suppressed expulsion nearby, rather than transmitting expulsion. This reinforces my
interpretation that economically central cities faced different risks and incentives than peripheral
cities (Sassen 2014); this effect appears not to be confined only to free and imperial cities. In
contrast, I find no evidence that greater incorporation into travel networks spread expulsions. In
theory, cities at the nexus of more routes would be exposed to expulsions through more network
connections that linked to more distant expulsions. Instead, as I have argued, the uptick in
expulsions in the fifteenth century was not a function of exposure.
Tracing inter-governmental networks for diffusion is difficult in the past as well as in the modern
world. Instead of relying only on proximity alone to represent inter-city social structure, I
adapted a measure common in the sociology of diffusion (Andrews and Biggs 2006; Braun 2011;
Hedström 1994) to account for categorical differences in power and status. By combining
classification with distance, I can distinguish the importance of a particular group of cities for
how others behaved. Historical knowledge about the case provides arguments for interpreting the
categorical and spatial patterns. We do not have direct evidence about the reasons behind
expulsion or non-expulsion for most cities. Historical studies might validate my conclusions and
provide insight on what cues city leaders took from other cities.
CONCLUSION
Medieval Europe was not a hospitable place for Jews. Antisemitic rumors and stereotypes
abounded, and Christian governments exploited and abused the ethnoreligious divide. Expulsions
in German lands were clearly another expression of Christian victimization of Jews. Almost half
of the years in the fifteenth century saw at least one expulsion. Yet there was no real momentum
towards expulsion among German city governments. Expulsions were a persistent but still

32

unusual occurrence. This article asks whether relational factors between cities explain why
expulsions increased but did not spread widely.
Using a dataset I built based on a German synthesis of city histories, I weighed internal and
network factors through discrete-time event history analysis, incorporating temporal and spatial
elements. The domestic incentives to exploit ethnoracial difference for the benefit of city
governments and rulers tethered most cities to the status quo of tolerating Jewish communities.
However, change in the Christian valuation of their Jewish neighbors and inter-city political and
economic relationships did facilitate the limited adoption of expulsion. Precisely because
Christian German city governments were racialized organizations instrumented for political and
economic advantage (Bracey 2015), expulsion spread among some cities, but not others.
This study affirms the value of the growing research body examining how space and ethnic or
racial extremism are related (Hoerner, Jaax, and Rodon 2019; Homola, Pereira, and Tavits
forthcoming; Pepinsky, Goodman, and Ziller 2020). Diffusion research often looks to proximity
as a facilitator, which may be appropriate for some types of extremism (Andrews and Seguin
2015). However, in contrast to conventional understanding, this study demonstrates that
proximity can hamper diffusion, too. I show that social structure quarantined diffusion within
economic micro-regions. Instead of searching only for what ties assist the spread of exclusion or
violence, studies should look for what kinds of proximity arrest it. Future research should test the
category-based diffusion measures used here, which provide one option for disaggregating
proximity.
The overall conclusion of this study is that inter-government relationships affect the adoption of
exclusionary policies. However, shared racialization by itself was not sufficient for the

33

transmission of expulsions. While new religious values and bigotry were necessary for
expulsions to begin, these interacted with the existing power structure such that the leaders of
expulsion come from an unexpected corner – secular city governments. This suggests that we
should pay as much attention to distributions of political and economic power as we do to
presumed ideological alignment in government-led exclusion and violence against minority
groups.

APPENDIX A. DATA COLLECTION
This study relies mostly on data contained in Geschichte der Juden im Mittelalter von der
Nordsee bis zu den Südalpen (Haverkamp 2002). This three-volume work was produced by a
team of historians, led by Alfred Haverkamp, under a grant from the German Research
Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) to complete a historiographical summary and
update on the history of Jews in the region of the Meuse and Rhine Rivers, 1000-1520 CE. The
project revisited the first efforts to do so, begun a century previously and published in three
volumes as Germania Judaica.
Jewish settlement and persecutions
The second volume of Geschichte der Juden is a city catalog that systematically describes Jewish
settlement, persecutions, city dominion, and city infrastructure in numbered lists, annotated with
sources. City dominion and infrastructure data came from the Deutsches Städtebuch (Keyser and
Stoob 1939), another multivolume work of historical detail on regional development. I digitized
the city catalog through data entry. As written, the catalog assigns dates in periods, since it can
be difficult to date medieval histories to specific years. To convert these periods to annual
observations, I follow a few procedures. When settlement dates are known, I include all years
between a first known year and a last known year, excepting any known disruptions due to

persecutions or expulsions. Where arrival is uncertain, if Jewish settlement in a town is only
apparent because of a pogrom or expulsion, I add the three prior years. If arrival date is uncertain
but settlement is evidenced within a period, such as through the undated erection of a synagogue,
I use the first year of the period. For expulsions, I discard possible expulsions with “uncertain”
evidence and expulsions without any dating to a year or range of years. Ranges occur when
dating can be made relative to other dated events or when it is unclear what system a primary
source uses to number months. In medieval Europe, some counted the new year and first month
from December 25, and others counted from March 25. For expulsions dated to a range of years,
I code the expulsion to the first year given. I follow the same procedures to record pogroms and
therefore create sums of prior persecutions and expulsions.
Domestic conditions
To assign city dominion, I recorded a dataset of dominion as spells for each city, with start and
end years and dominion parties. From the dominion parties, I coded whether dominion was held
(or shared) by the emperor, princes, bishops, archbishops, and more, or whether the city held
rights of self-government and was therefore a free city. I transformed this spell-based data into
an annual table of the specific parties and party types for each year for each city. From this I can
construct the counts of expulsions under different types of rulers.
To measure city economic and political institutions, I assign their presence for all years in a
period in which they are evidenced, or from the year of their first evidence, and all successive
years, unless it is recorded that they were changed, removed, or otherwise no longer existent.
For Jewish community development, I similarly assign the presence of a cemetery, mikveh, or
Jewish quarter for all years in a period in which they are evidenced, or from the year of their first
36

evidence, and all successive years, unless it is recorded that they were destroyed or otherwise no
longer existent. I include Jewish quarters in this list because they were originally a requested
feature of Jewish urban life, to facilitate keeping the Sabbath and to make space more defensible
(Haverkamp 1995).
For membership in regional alliances, I recreated Distler’s (2006) table of regional alliances. I
reorganized it from treaty-based observations with a list of parties to treaty-party observations
that list a single party, a single year, and a single treaty. From here I could code whether each
city participated in an alliance treaty in a year (and how many) and calculate how many prior
alliances the city had participated in.
Spatial relationships
The first volume of Geschichte der Juden, and one of its improvements over Germania Judaica,
contains maps produced in the early cartographic software Freehand. The digital files and their
metadata are not available, nearly 20 years after their production. I digitized and georeferenced
the maps in QGIS to gather city locations; duplicate names and otherwise-lost locations of
historical cities make these maps vital for any spatial analyses. The maps appear to be created
using the German Gauss-Krüger projection. For this study, the data were reprojected to the
Lambert azimuthal equal area projection for Europe based on the European Terrestrial System
1989 (ETRS89), code EPSG:3035 (unit: meters). A Lambert azimuthal equal area projection
preserves both distance and direction better than other map projections. The continent-scale
projection is necessary because the study area is geographically large. Because distance accuracy
and intelligibility are vital for this analysis, EPSG:3035 is the best map projection choice. All
spatial calculations are performed using this projection and transformed into kilometers.

37

I obtain distances between cities along river and road travel routes. Bossak and Welford (2015)
shared the data they collected of pilgrimage routes. I transformed these routes, composed of
geolocated city sequences, into segmented lines. For water-based travel routes, I downloaded the
Natural Earth rivers and lake centerlines (10 meter resolution) with scale ranks. Prior to spatial
calculations, I preprocessed the pilgrimate routes and river courses in QGIS. I completed a
spatial dissolve, added vertices at intersections, and snapped the city locations onto the network
at the nearest route. Then I used the riverdist R package (Tyers 2017) and its
riverdistancemat function to calculate distances between each city and all other cities
along the network. For accuracy, since not all cities were located close to a transit route, I
augmented the inter-city distances by adding in the distances between actual city locations and
their network-snapped locations.
Hypotheses indicated that expelling cities should be closer to each other than what random
spatial distribution of expulsions would predict. Investigating spatial autocorrelation of
expulsions is also a pre-regression best practice (Kelly 2019). The unit of analysis here is cities,
which are located at spatial points. If the units of analysis were spatial regions, I might use
Moran’s i to measure spatial autocorrelation (Tiefelsdorf 2000). Instead, I performed a Monte
Carlo test of average nearest neighbors. I simulated 1000 random assignments of whether a city
ever expelled, maintaining the overall number of expelling cities within each simulation. Figure
A1 shows the outcomes of the simulations compared to the observed average distance to a city’s
nearest neighbor. The observed average nearest expelling neighbor is 28.99 kilometers away.
The observed distance is below 86.7% of the simulated neighbor distances. This does not provide
evidence that the distribution of expulsions is non-random. Among non-expelling cities, the
observed average nearest neighbor is 13.56 kilometers away. In these simulations, the observed
38

distance is below 67.9% of the simulated neighbor distances. We cannot conclude that the
distribution of non-expulsions is non-random.

APPENDIX B. BAYESIAN EVENT-HISTORY ANALYSES: ROBUSTNESS
To test my trust in the main results, I completed series of additional analyses as robustness
checks. First, I examined whether economic shocks, as a result of climate variation and the
resulting fluctuation in agricultural production, contributed to patterns in expulsions. Second, I
revisited the main results and adjusted the time lag from 10 years to 5 years and to 20 years.
Other research has concluded that poor harvests (Behringer 1995, 1999; Oster 2004) led to
violent scapegoating of Jewish communities (Anderson et al. 2017) in medieval and early
modern Europe. Such a pattern might hide within the temporal and spatiotemporal measures I
have used, as it would have both temporal and geographic dimensions. To rule out this
alternative, I imitate how Anderson, Johnson, and Koyama (2017) investigate poor harvests,
using annual growing season (March-September) temperatures. I rely on the Community Climate
Systems Model 4.0 (CCSM4.0) monthly climate retrodictions (Landrum et al. 2012) produced by
the U.S. National Center for Atmospheric Research for 800-1800CE. Unlike the Guiot, Corona,
and ESCARSEL Members (Guiot, Corona, and Members 2010) retrodictions some use, the
CCSM4.0 retrodictions cover the entire European continent, including the Alps. I extract the
mean monthly temperatures (Celsius) for each city for March through September for each year
and average them, then lag the temperature measures one year (min=6.95, max=18.88,
mean=13.99, median=14.11, sd=1.26). As with other continuous variables, I rescale the
temperature lags to a distribution centered on 0 with a standard deviation of 0.5 prior to
including this variable in the model. Reanalysis with growing season temperature variation (table
B1) does not change the main results, and there is no relationship between temperature and
expulsion.

Note. Continuous variables were scaled prior to estimation to the distribution mean = 0, sd = 2.5.
As a last step, I returned to the original model specifications. In the main analyses, diffusion
measures were calculated by using counts of expulsions in the prior 10 years. I recalculated the
diffusion measures for two alternative spans: 5 years and 20 years. Table B2 displays descriptive
statistics for these variables. I reestimated model 4 using each of these variations (see table B3).
Using a 5-year span, the temporal and spatial diffusion effects disappear, except distance from
Constance. Instead, the 15-year time period dummies soak up the temporal variation in

41

expulsions. One change using the 20-year span is that in model B3, the spatial suppression effect
seen originally only among free and imperial cities is evident for episcopal cities as well. Ten
years appears to be a sensitive enough temporal lag.

APPENDIX C. BAYESIAN EVENT-HISTORY ANALYSES: DETAILS
The discrete-time event history analysis results in this study were calculated using Markov Chain
Monte Carlo Bayesian methods for logistic regression. I use the rstanarm package 2.18.2
(Stan Development Team 2018a) in R (version 3.6.3), which uses the No-U-Turn Sampler
(NUTS) Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. I use weakly informative priors
(Betancourt 2017; Gelman et al. 2008; McElreath 2016; Stan Development Team 2018b). For
the independent variable terms, I choose the Student’s t distribution (df=7, scale=2.5), while I
use the half-t distribution (df=4, scale=1) for intercept priors. Each model was estimated using
five chains of 5,000 iterations, discarding the first 2,500. For each model I report in table C1 the
step size between iterations and the number of divergent transitions (out of total 12,500 for each
model). Table C2 lists the effective sample size for each variable for each model, noting whether
the potential scale reduction factor ℛ̂ for each variable is greater than 1.01 (a warning that the
chains disagree on estimates) or than 1.05 (a serious sign of unreliable results). Pareto-smoothed
importance sampling leave-one-out cross-validation (PSIS-LOO) (Vehtari et al. 2018; Vehtari,
Gelman, and Gabry 2017) is the most reliable strategy to assess confidence in Bayesian model
results. Unfortunately, PSIS-LOO is computationally intensive for large samples, especially
when model specifications are complicated. Instead, I use exact -fold cross-validation. For each
model specification, the data are randomly and evenly divided into 10 sub-samples stratified by
the 15-year period dummies (maintaining some sense of time-related balance in each subsample)
before re-estimating 10 times on nine of the sub-samples. Table C3 contains -fold expected log
predictive densities (ELPDs) and standard errors. All ELPDs are approximately the same,
meaning that model selection here is down to theoretical reasons and interpretability.
