A confusing definition of disruption

Abstract It is important to measure whether a work is disruptive or developing. In 2016, Funk
and Owen-Smith proposed novel indexes to evaluate the degree of a patent consolidating or
destabilizing the technology streams (doi:10.1287/mnsc.2015.2366). Based on their methods, Wu
et al. (2019) studied the disruption of articles, patents and software products, and made a conclusion
that small teams are more disruptive than large teams (doi:10.1287/mnsc.2015.2366). Our research
finds that the effect of NR on the disruption equation is contradictory as the sign of the disruption
changes, and this problem may cause more trouble in any further work based on their indexes. When
using other suitable approaches to measure how disruptive a work would be to the field of science
or technology, we predict that there is no significant difference between large and small teams.

Introduction
It is important to measure whether a work is disruptive or developing. Wu et al.1 used an index
that was previously designed by Funk and Owen-Smith2 to measure how disruptive a work would
be to the field of science or technology. A flaw in this disruption measure raises concerns about the
validity of their conclusions.

The definition of disruption
As Wu et al.1 reported, Equation (1) shows the definition of the disruption:
ùê∑=

ùëÅ ‚àíùëÅ
ùëÅ +ùëÅ +ùëÅ

where ùê∑ is the disruption of the focal work, ùëÅ is the total number of works that cite just the focal
work without citing any of the work‚Äôs references, ùëÅ is the total number of works that cite both
the focal work and any its references, and ùëÅ is the total number of works that cite just any of the
focal work‚Äôs references without citing the focal work itself (Fig. 1).

Examples
The first two lines of Fig. 1 indicate that a nonzero ùëÅ weakens the disruption of the focal work
when the value of (ùëÅ ‚àí ùëÅ ) is positive. For example, by comparing works Œ± and Œ≤ in Table 1,
we can see that Œ≤ has a larger ùëÅ and ends up being judged less disruptive. This assessment fits
the common sense that a larger ùëÅ should lead to a less disruptive work if the values of ùëÅ and
ùëÅ are fixed.

Things become complicated when the value of (ùëÅ ‚àí ùëÅ ) is negative. By Equation (1), the
existence of ùëÅ

enhances the disruption of the focal work when the value of (ùëÅ ‚àí ùëÅ ) is

negative. By comparing works Œ≥ and Œ¥ in Table 1, we can see that, both Œ≤ and Œ¥ have a large
ùëÅ value. Accordingly, we may expect Œ¥ to be less disruptive than Œ≥, just like Œ≤ is less disruptive
than Œ±. However, if we apply the disruption measure reported by Wu et al.1, we find that Œ¥ is more
disruptive than Œ≥, since Œ¥ has a larger disruption (‚àí0.40 > ‚àí0.80).
Such a confusing result implies that the given disruption measure cannot reveal the true disruption
of a scientific or technological work in some cases. Therefore, in Wu et al.‚Äôs work1, any conclusion
based on regressions fitting the relation between team size and disruption may be unreliable.
Moreover, views disagreeing with Wu et al. have been reported by some previous research efforts
which showed that individuals working alone are less likely to make breakthroughs and more likely
to end up with ordinary outcomes3, while larger teams tend to achieve higher-impact and more
destabilizing results2,4.

Conclusion
In conclusion, the effect of ùëÅ on the disruption is contradictory as the sign of the disruption
changes, and this problem may cause more trouble in any further work based on Equation (1). The
authors consider it as a flaw in this disruption measure, and strongly recommend Wu et al. to
redesign this approach or come up with a reasonable explanation for the inconsistency. When using
other suitable approaches to measure how disruptive a work would be to the field of science or
technology, the authors predict that there is no significant difference between large and small teams.
