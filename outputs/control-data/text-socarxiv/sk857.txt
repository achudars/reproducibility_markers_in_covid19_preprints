Conflicted Religionists: Measuring political
backlash on salient issues
Sean Bock
Harvard University

Abstract. Scholars have pointed to politics as a key reason for why people leave religion, arguing that
the national-level rise of the Christian Right has resulted in a “political backlash” of sorts, driving liberals and moderates away from their affiliations. Recent studies have advanced the political backlash model
by emphasizing the process at lower levels, measuring broad political disagreement within congregations
and subsequent disaffiliation among religionists. I argue that while studying political disagreement at the
congregational level is a step in the right direction, the role of conflict on specific, salient issues has been
underemphasized. Using data from the Baylor Religion Survey, I exploit a unique set of items to analyze
what I call “conflicted religionists”—religionists who experience attitudinal conflict with their churches—and
I measure conflict on two salient issues: same-sex marriage and abortion. I find that there is a considerable
proportion of conflicted religionists on both issues and that the probability of experiencing conflict varies
drastically across different groups in the sample. I further demonstrate that experiencing conflict is significantly associated with lower church attendance. I conclude with a discussion of the importance of salient
issues for our understanding of political backlash and future disaffiliation.
Over the last half-century, the landscape of American religion has shifted dramatically.
From the restructuring following World War Two (Wuthnow 1988) to the more recent polarization of religionists (Schnabel and Bock 2018), sociologists have studied changes in
American religion that have had important consequences for both politics and social change
more broadly. Perhaps the most notable and consequential change to American religion
over the past several decades, though, has been the rapid rise of the unaffiliated or religious
“nones” (Voas and Chaves 2016; Hout and Fischer 2014, 2002).
There has been a growing body of work on the disaffiliation of American religionists since
the late-1980s (e.g., Voas and Chaves 2016; Hout and Fischer 2014, 2002). One prominent
explanation has been the “political backlash” hypothesis, which points to the increased politicization of religion at the end of the 1980s and the rise of the Christian Right resulting in
conflict between liberal and moderate parishioners and churches that espoused more conservative teachings—especially with family-related issues, such as abortion and homosexuality
(Hout and Fischer 2014, 2002). This conflict, it goes, led to the subsequent disaffiliation
of these religionists from churches, explaining in part the marked and continuous rise of
religious “nones.”
Most studies related to the political backlash hypothesis have studied this phenomenon
by making post-disaffiliation observations at the aggregate level—that is, past studies have

relied on descriptive trends among disaffiliated religionists over the past several decades. And
thus, the conflict between religionists and churches—and the subsequent disaffiliation—has
been surmised based on characteristics about those who have already dropped their religious
affiliations: political liberals disaffiliated at a higher rate compared to other groups, and
therefore political conflict was inferred as the culprit for the increased share of religious
“nones.”
However, this approach fails to measure an important link in the proposed mechanism,
which is conflict between religionists and churches. Assuming that at any given moment there
is a number of religionists who are conflicting with their churches and have not yet disaffiliated (i.e., it is unlikely that the process of experiencing attitudinal conflict and disaffiliation
is instantaneous), one could measure these “conflicted religionists” and make descriptive observations about this group. The reason for the former approach in the literature is largely
due to data limitations: it is difficult to obtain a measure of conflict between a religionist
and his or her church. While recent work has made progress toward understanding political
conflict at the congregational level (Djupe et al. 2018b; Djupe and Lewis 2015; Djupe 2011;
Djupe and Gilbert 2008), these studies have under-emphasized specific, salient issues—such
as abortion and same-sex marriage–and their role in declining religious identity and participation among American religionists. Directly studying perceived conflict on specific issues
within congregations would provide further clarity as to the mechanisms underlying political
backlash: rather than focusing on responses to national-level political movements (Hout and
Fischer 2014) or broad political disagreement within congregations (Djupe et al. 2018b), a
study of conflict on key issues provides a more contextual and realistic understanding of the
relationship between politics and religious participation and identity.
The present study seeks to fill this gap by taking advantage of several unique items related to personal attitudes and church teachings to create a novel measure called “conflicted
religionists.” I use data from the Baylor Religion Survey (Wave II) to compare responses to
questions about respondents’ personal attitudes toward abortion and same-sex marriage and
questions about the respondents’ current church’s attitudes toward these same issues. I identify respondents who perceive their personal views as different from the views of their current
church, and I examine how this differs across important socio-demographic groups, such as:
religious affiliation, political orientation, age, and educational attainment. A breakdown of
conflicted religionists by socio-demographic variables helps to answer several questions abut
the dynamics of political conflict among religionists. For instance: Are conflicted religionists actually on the political left? Are conflicted religionists concentrated in mainline and
Catholic churches where the hierarchy has been at notable odds with the laity? Is political
conflict largely a function of young people and a changing culture?
Under the political backlash model, we would expect conflict to lead to disaffiliation from
churches. Given that the data consists of a single cross-section, I take the best available step
here to understand the relationship between conflict and religious participation by measuring the association between conflicted religionists and church attendance. I do this in two
ways: First, I measure the association between perceived conflict and church attendance to
assess whether or not conflicted religionists attend church less frequently than non-conflicted
religionists. Second, I take advantage of an item that asks respondents about their estimated
church attendance frequency at age 12 to measure the association between perceived conflict

and decreased church attendance from age 12. To ensure that the results are robust, both
of these associations are measured using coarsened exact matching (CEM) techniques.1
To preview the findings, being a political liberal is clearly the most important predictor of
conflict for both same-sex marriage and abortion, while a small proportion of conservatives
are predicted to be conflicted religionists. While an expected result, this finding demonstrates that rather sorting into churches with similar views to their own (Wuthnow 1988), a
sizable portion of liberal religionists remain in conservative churches and have perceived disagreements over important social issues—potentially a harbinger for sustained disaffiliation.
Evangelicals stand out as having especially low-levels of predicted conflict, while mainliners and Catholics have a sizable proportion of predicted conflicted religionists—especially
on same-sex marriage. Finally, I find that conflicted religion is negatively associated with
church attendance: conflict on same-sex marriage is associated with an estimated 41.02%
lower yearly church attendance, and conflict on abortion is associated with an estimated
60.35% lower yearly church attendance. Moreover, for both issues, conflict is associated with
an increased probability of attending church less frequently than at age 12. Taken together,
these results suggest that studying conflicted religionists provides important insight into the
underlying mechanisms of political backlash.

Background
There has been a renewed interest in the study of religion by sociologists. With vast changes
occurring in family structure, politics, demography, and social movements, sociologists have
been interested in the effects of religion on behavior and attitudes of individuals (Bolzendahl
and Brooks 2005). This interest has been especially strong in the United States, which has
shown high levels of religious participation compared to other post-industrialized nations
(Norris and Inglehart 2004). Despite this highly religious “exceptionalism”, the greatest
change to religion in the United States over the past few decades has been the drastic
increase of the “nonreligious” (Hout and Fischer 2014, 2002). This trend has occurred much
to the surprise of religion scholars.

Religious restructuring model
In his book, The Restructuring of American Religion, Wuthnow (1988) describes vast changes
in the American religious landscape following World War Two. While the 1950’s and preceding decades were defined by a strong Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish divide, the CivilRights Era effected a broader division between religious liberals and religious conservatives,
thus making the traditional denominational demarcation increasingly irrelevant. The new
division resulted in larger conflict within traditional denominations, leading to the rise of
new sects and “special purpose groups” (Wuthnow 1988). With increased variety within
1

To be clear, causal claims cannot be made about these association — I cannot preclude the possibility
of reverse causality or other endogeneity concerns, which does not allow me to make causal claims about the
relationship between attitude conflict and religious participation. However, we can measure the relationship
between perceived conflict and church attendance and assess whether or not the found associations are
consistent with the proposed political backlash mechanism.

denominations, outlets were created for those with dissenting views who may have otherwise left the religion altogether. Such denominational diversity—and the lack of a single,
national church, as seen in several European countries—has been pointed to as one of the
central reasons for the United States’ unique level of religious participation among Western
industrialized nations (Chaves and Gorski 2001). The restructuring model suggests that we
should see sustained religious vitality and little conflict within churches in the United States.
Why, then, has the nonreligious population increased so dramatically?

Political backlash model
Surprisingly, the 1990’s saw a drastic increase in the number of people identifying as “nonreligious,” and this number has steadily increased since 2000 (Hout and Fischer 2014): 20%
of Americans claimed no religious preference in 2012, compared to 7% in 1987. Hout and
Fischer (2014; 2002) offer the most detailed analysis of this important trend, identifying
“unchurched believers,” those who maintain their beliefs about God but claim no organized
religious identity, as the most significant portion of the increasing “nonreligious” population.
They also noticed that this increase of the “nonreligious” corresponded with the rise of the
“Christian Right”, a time when organized religions were receiving an unprecedented prominence in public discourse; ideas of religion, more specifically God and Christ, were cited as
inspiration for politicians (Domke and Coe 2008; Hout and Fischer 2014, 2002). This entanglement of politics and religion—more specifically, the Right with Evangelicalism—they
argue, ultimately drove people with conflicting political views (i.e., moderates and liberals)
to disaffiliate.2 In short, Americans increasingly saw religion as at odds with their politics.
Going against the conventional wisdom of religion scholars, Hout and Fischer, and others
(Djupe et al. 2018b; Schnabel and Bock 2017; Patrikios 2008) have argued that this political
backlash model is important for understanding the rapid disaffiliation seen over the last few
decades.
While there is strong evidence for liberal political views leading to disaffiliation (Hout
and Fischer 2014), these findings focus on aggregate level trends and infer a backlash to
macro-level political phenomena (the rise of the Christian Right). That is, the evidence
in favor of the political backlash model has been based on strong associations between
liberal political ideology and disaffiliation, and thus the mechanism of political backlash—
attitudinal conflict—has been surmised on these descriptive aggregate trends.
Recent scholarship has advanced the political backlash model by further contextualizing
the mechanism of attitudinal conflict at lower levels, such as the state (Djupe et al. 2018a)
and church-levels (Djupe et al. 2018b; Djupe and Lewis 2015; Djupe 2011; Patrikios 2008;
Djupe and Gilbert 2008). For instance, Djupe et al. (2018a) find evidence of higher rates of
disaffiliation in states where there is an increased presence of the Christian Right, suggesting
that political backlash may depend on context and the presence of salient controversy. Other
studies have contextualized this dynamic further by focusing on backlash within specific
congregations (Djupe et al. 2018b; Patrikios 2008). Patrikios (2008) found that Democrats
have reduced their church attendance frequency in recent years because of their perceived
2

Hout and Fischer also considered the effects of cohort replacement and secularization. They found
that cohort replacement does explain some of the increased “nonreligious” category, while secularization, or
decreased belief in God, does not.

association between churches and Republican Party politics. Djupe et al. (2018b) continued
the emphasis on specific congregational dynamics, providing the most thorough analysis of
political backlash occurring at the congregational level. Their results provide robust evidence
that perceived disagreement within congregations is the key driver of disaffiliation and that
backlash over the Christian Right occurs amongst those who are more likely to experience
disagreement in their congregations. Taken together, these results suggest that dynamics at
the congregational level are key to our understanding of the mechanisms of political backlash.
As Djupe et al. (2018b) note, the societal-level pattern of religious “nones” increasingly being
concentrated on the political left is likely the aggregation of sets of localized differences
(Djupe et al. 2018: 162).
Studies demonstrating the key role of congregational-level disagreement for political backlash have operationalized disagreement broadly as political differences with one’s congregation or opposition to the Christian Right movement (Djupe et al. 2018b). While salient and
controversial issues have been considered important parts of political backlash (e.g., The
Christian Right made controversial issues, such as abortion and homosexuality, salient in
the public sphere, thus driving religionists with dissenting views on those issues away from
organized religion) disagreement on these issues—and their role in the process of political
backlash—has gone unmeasured (Djupe et al. 2018a; Hout and Fischer 2014, 2002). Rather
than general disagreement with one’s congregation, a study of disagreement on specific,
salient issues provides a more realistic picture of political backlash. For instance, due to social change or life course processes, a religionist may develop new attitudes on certain issues
which are now at odds with the teachings of her church. In this scenario, it is possible that
the religionist experiences conflict on a specific issue—or set of issues–but does not oppose
all views of the Christian Right or Republican Party, for example. Here, rather than broad
disagreement with one’s church, it is disagreement on specific issues that matters for one’s
political-religious conflict and potential backlash. Further, an emphasis on specific issues
allow for more flexibility in predicting political backlash across populations and over time:
Different groups of people will conflict on different issues and social change may effect new
salient issues that become points of conflict. Just as controversy over salient issues at the
state level is an important predictor of political backlash (Djupe et al. 2018a), I argue here
that the dynamic of specific salient issues within churches is vital to our understanding of
this process, and it is this dynamic on which this article focuses.
In order to measure this group of conflicted religionists, the following logic must be
assumed: the process of conflict and disaffiliation is not instantaneous (i.e., at any given
point in time, there will be a group of religionists who conflict with their churches but
have not yet disaffiliated.)3 Following this logic, it would be possible to analyze those
who conflict with their churches and then study subsequent disaffiliation, allowing for a
clear understanding of the political backlash process. While cross-sectional data do not
lend themselves to measuring attitude conflict and disaffiliation directly, I can measure the
association between conflicted religionists and other important behavior that is potentially
related to disaffiliation, such as religious participation (Patrikios 2008). Again, as the process
3

Importantly, I am not arguing that every person who experiences conflict will eventually disaffiliate. I
am simply saying that those who do disaffiliate as a result of attitude conflict will not do so immediately
following the experience of said conflict.

of experiencing conflict and disaffiliation is not likely instantaneous, we could imagine a
more likely sequence of events: 1) a religionist experiences attitude conflict with his or
her church; 2) this conflict causes a change in his or her behavior related to said church—
declined participation; and then 3) eventually the conflict leads to disaffiliation altogether.
This sequence of events describes a more gradual process, whereby conflicted religionists
slowly decline in their religious participation and then eventually leave their churches or
affiliations altogether. Thus, a researcher could use a single cross-section of data to measure
the association between conflicted religionists and religious participation, such as church
attendance, to see if attitude conflict is associated with lower religious participation. While
causal claims cannot be made about this association, we can assess whether or not the
association is consistent with the model.
While an individual’s beliefs may differ from that of his or her church on a wide range
of social issues, this study focuses on abortion and same-sex marriage. These issues were
chosen for at least five reasons. First, abortion and same-sex marriage are the only two
social issues for which there are data about the views of both the respondent and his or
her church. Though there are several other interesting and important issues to consider
(e.g., environmentalism, marijuana legalization, pre-martial sex, and cohabitation), these two
issues provide a good starting point for our understanding of conflicted religionists. Second,
same-sex marriage and abortion are key family issues that have been championed by the
Christian Right and are issues that Hout and Fischer explicitly identify as being contentious
issues and possible culprits for the conflict seen in the 1990’s (Djupe et al. 2018a; Hout
and Fischer 2014, 2002). Third, both issues have been shown to be significantly important
to people, politically (Schnabel 2016; Hoffmann and Johnson 2005; Jelen and Wilcox 2003;
Manza and Brooks 1997; Olson et al. 2006). Fourth, examining these two issues provides
a comparison between an issue that has seen rapid attitudinal change (same-sex marriage)
(Baunach 2012; Gay et al. 2015; Powell et al. 2010; Schnabel 2016; Sherkat et al. 2010)
and one that has seen little attitudinal change in the aggregate over the past few decades,
but has become increasingly sorted along partisan lines (abortion) (Bolzendahl and Brooks
2005; Hoffmann and Johnson 2005; Jelen and Wilcox 2003). Fifth and finally, religion plays
a major role in shaping attitudes about both issues (Adamczyk and Pitt 2009; Bolzendahl
and Brooks 2005; Ellison et al. 2005; Jelen and Wilcox 2003; Olson et al. 2006; Wuthnow
1988).

Where is conflicted religion concentrated?
Building on established knowledge of same-sex marriage and abortion attitudes, this study
focuses on four key variables to identify likely conflicted religionists: political orientation,
religious tradition, education level, and age.
Political Orientation remains one of the most important factors for predicting attitudes
toward social issues. By and large, liberals are much more likely to support same-sex marriage
(Baunach 2012; Powell et al. 2010; Sherkat et al. 2010) and abortion (Jelen and Wilcox
2003). Furthermore, liberals, by a considerable margin, have been the most common group

6

Bock

Conflicted Religionists

to disaffiliate over the past several decades (Djupe et al. 2018b; Hout and Fischer 2014, 2002).
These patterns make liberals a likely and expected candidate for experiencing conflict.4
While I will examine the patterns among each of the predominant religious traditions
in the U.S., this study is primarily focused on the comparison between Evangelicals and
everybody else. Denominational lines—especially between Catholics and mainliners—have
become increasingly irrelevant since the post-war era, and the most prominent demarcation,
in terms of religious beliefs and practices, now lies between Evangelicals and non-Evangelicals
(Schnabel and Bock 2018, 2017; Schnabel 2016; Wuthnow 1988). Moreover, Evangelicals
have distinguished themselves by holding relatively stagnant, conservative social views, and,
thus, there is likely little conflict among Evangelicals, because their Evangelical identities
are contingent upon holding such conservative attitudes (Schnabel 2016).
Educational attainment has long been considered an important influence on social attitudes (Ohlander et al. 2005; Phelan et al. 1995). There is a classic notion of education
being correlated with increased acceptance of nonconformity and civil liberties, which results
in more liberal stances on social issues (Ohlander et al. 2005; Schoon et al. 2009). Despite
drastic changes in attitudes toward same-sex marriage at the aggregate level, more highly educated Americans remain more tolerant of same-sex marriage (Ohlander et al. 2005; Sherkat
et al. 2010). As such, it has been shown that educational attainment is still an important
factor for predicting liberal social attitudes and, therefore, is likely related to one having
conflicting views with his or her church. This prediction is further bolstered by data on the
“unchurched believers,” which shows that having more education is linked to a higher rate
of disaffiliation (Hout and Fischer 2014, 2002).
With far-reaching changes over the past few decades, social scientists have given special
attention to differences in attitudes between age groups (Voas and Chaves 2016; Baunach
2012; Hout and Fischer 2014, 2002; Powell et al. 2010; Schwadel 2010). The general trend
reflects a younger population that is unprecedentedly tolerant, especially in regard to samesex issues, and an older population that is still widely in opposition to abortion (Jelen and
Wilcox 2003) and same-sex marriage (Baunach 2012; Gay et al. 2015; Sherkat et al. 2010).
Younger Americans show lower levels of religious activity in several regards: they are more
likely to report no religious preference (Hout and Fischer 2014, 2002; Schwadel 2010); their
church attendance is lower; they pray less often; and, they are the least likely to hold a literal
interpretation of the bible (Gay et al. 2015). Some scholars have pointed to an increased
value of autonomy among younger Americans, which leads to the fading of authoritative
influence (e.g. religion), as the reason for such activity (Hout and Fischer 2014). As such,
along with high support for same-sex marriage, young Americans are likely to conflict with
their church’s views.

The importance of political orientation is clear, as moderates and liberals have the largest coefficients
in the multivariable analyses—by far. But, adding political orientation to the models does not alter the
patterns seen among the other covariates, suggesting that political orientation is not responsible for the
patterns seen in religious tradition, for example.

Data, Measures, and Methods
Data
The data used in this study are from the 2007 Baylor Religion Survey (Wave II), a national
random sample of 1648 adults in the United States. This wave (Wave II) was administered
and collected by the Gallup Organization, using a mixed-mode method of telephone and selfadministered mailed surveys in October and November of 2007. A random digit procedure
was used to avoid various sources of bias (Baylor Religion Survey). According to the Baylor
Religion Survey website, one can say with 95% confidence that the error attributable to
sampling and other random effects could be plus or minus four percentage points (Baylor
Religion Survey).5 See Table B1 for full-sample weighted descriptive statistic.
For the purposes of this paper, I only discuss analyses and results for a sub-sample,
which is those who are currently in churches that have conservative attitudes toward samesex marriage and abortion (same-sex marriage: N =920; abortion: N =1,003). The attitudes
of the church are based on the respondent’s answers to questions about his or her current
church’s beliefs. I also analyzed conflicted religionists who attend churches with more liberal
attitudes toward same-sex marriage and abortion, but as this group is very low in number
(same-sex marriage: n=132; abortion: n=63), I do not discuss them in the main body of
the paper. See Appendix D for analyses and further discussion of this group. While this
group of conflicted religionists is interesting and should be evaluated further in future studies,
studying conflicted religionists in conservative churches is more theoretically important given
recent patterns of social change and is more relevant to the political backlash hypothesis.

Dependent variables
Same-sex marriage conflict
I measure conflict on same-sex marriage views by comparing two items. I compare one
item that concerns the personal views toward same-sex marriage and one that concerns the
respondent’s church’s views toward homosexual behavior. Respondents are asked to indicate
their level of agreement (1= Strongly disagree; 2=Disagree; 3=Agree; 4=Strongly Agree)
with the following question: “Please indicate your level of agreement with the following
statements about homosexuals: Homosexuals should be allowed to marry.” Responses were
recoded (1/2=1; 3/4=0)6 to create a dichotomous measure of personal same-sex marriage
attitudes (1=opposed; 0=in favor). Respondents were asked to answer the following question
about their church’s views (Forbids=1; Strongly discourages=2; Somewhat discourages=3;
Encourages=4; Isn’t Concerned=5) toward homosexual behavior: “By your best guess, how
would your current place of worship feel about each of the following? Homosexual behavior.”
Responses were recoded (1/3=1; 4/5=0) to create a dichotomous measure (1=opposed; 0=in
favor) of respondents’ churches’ views on homosexual behavior.

Conflicted Religionists

While these items refer to two different topics (same-sex marriage and homosexual behavior), comparing these two items provides a good—the best available—measure of one’s
conflict with his or her church on same-sex marriage views for at least two reasons: (1)
past research shows a strong correlation between broader views about homosexuality and
views toward same-sex marriage (Powell et al. 2010), and (2) as this study is interested in
the perceived conflict from the point of view of the individual, it is not unreasonable to
assume that, in most cases, people would view their attitudes toward same-sex marriage to
be incompatible with their church’s views, based on the church’s perceived feelings about
homosexual behavior (i.e. if an individual believes that his or her church forbids homosexual
behavior, they are not likely to perceive the church as supportive of same-same marriage).
Abortion conflict
To measure conflict on abortion attitudes, I compare respondents’ answers to questions about
both personal attitudes toward abortion and the teachings of their current churches. The survey asks the respondent how they feel (1=Always wrong, 2=Almost always wrong, 3=Only
wrong sometimes, 4=Not wrong at all) about the morality of the following: “Abortion, if
the family cannot afford the child?” Responses were recoded (1/2=1, 3/4=0) to create a
dichotomous measure (1= opposed, 0=in favor) of personal abortion views. Responses to
this question were compared to the responses to the following item, which asks about the
views (1=Forbids, 2=Strongly discourages, 3=Somewhat discourages, 4=Encourages, 5=
Isn’t Concerned) of the respondent’s current church: “By your best guess, how would your
current place of worship feel about each of the following behaviors? Abortion” Responses
were recoded (1/3=1, 4/5=0, 8=missing), creating a dichotomous measure (1=opposed,
0=in favor) of church’s views toward abortion.
The recoded responses to the items involving personal views of abortion and the views of
the respondent’s church were tabulated to create two categories of abortion attitude conflict:
(1) abortion conflict in “conservative” churches (personal views=0; church’s views=1) and
(2) abortion conflict in “liberal” churches (personal views=1; church’s views=0). Again, this
study examines the people in the first category—those in conservative churches.
Comparing the responses to these items provides a good measure of conflict between
one’s personal views and the views of his or her church on abortion. While the two items
do not align perfectly (i.e. the personal views question asks about the morality of abortion,
while the church’s views question asks about feelings toward abortion), moral approval or
disapproval is largely responsible for one’s attitudes toward abortion (Evans 2002; Hoffmann
and Johnson 2005). Furthermore, these items provide the best-available measure of conflict,
as the Baylor Religion Survey is the only known national survey that asks about both
personal views and the views of individuals’ churches on abortion. (See Appendix A for the
distribution of responses given to the items used in the creation of each dependent variable.)
Church attendance frequency
I use two different outcomes to estimate the relationship between experiencing conflict and
church attendance frequency. The first is church attendance frequency, and the second is a
measure of change in church attendance frequency from the age 12.
9

Bock

Conflicted Religionists

Church attendance frequency was originally measured in the survey as an ordinal scale,
ranging from 0) “never” to 7) “several times a week”. For interpretability, I transform this
measure into an interval scale, approximating days of attendance per year. I then logtransform the result.7
Change in church attendance frequency. Given that the data are a single cross-sectional,
I cannot measure over-time processes. However, I am able to take advantage of a measure
of change in church attendance from age 12 as a second way of estimating the association between experiencing conflict and church participation. This variable was created by
subtracting estimated church attendance frequency at age 12 from current level of church
attendance. The resultant measure was then dichotomized: 1=lower attendance frequency
than at age 12; 0=greater or equal attendance frequency compared to age 12. While not
perfect (i.e., estimates of R’s church attendance frequency at age 12 may be biased upward
or downward), this measure allows for the most robust estimate of an over-time component
available with a single cross-section of data.

Key independent variables
Political orientation is measured by respondent’s answers to the question “How would you
describe yourself politically?”. Responses range from 1 (“extremely conservative”) to 7 (“extremely liberal”). In line with Hout and Fischer’s 2002 classification, I use a three-way
political orientation variable: 1) conservative 2) moderate and 3) liberal.
Religious tradition is measured by the commonly used “RELTRAD” variable. This variable was created from a larger pool of self-reported religious affiliation to further categorize
respondents into seven categories based on the Steensland et al. (2000) religious categorization scheme: Evangelical protestant, Black Protestant, Mainline Protestant, Catholic,
Jewish, other, and none. Because of small cell counts, I drop Jews and the small number of
religious “nones” who attended a church. While unfortunate, I do not think this limiting of
religious traditions substantially harms the substantive findings of this paper—especially as
I am most concerned with the evangelical/non-evangelical comparison.8
Education is measured by self-reported highest level of education, ranging from 1 (“less
than high school) to 5 (“graduate degree.” ). I collapse responses into three categories: Low
(HS or less), Medium (Some college), and High (college degree or higher).
Age is measured in years.

Control variables
This study controls for key demographic characteristics that may affect one’s likelihood of
conflicting with his or her church on same-sex marriage and abortion attitudes. These variables were chosen based on what is standard in the literature related to public opinion on
7

A constant is added in the log transformation because of zero values for ’“never attend.” While the
use of interval scales as a continuous outcome variable in analyses is typically a cause for concern, this
transformation can be thought of as similar to that which is commonly done with translating categorical
income brackets into a nominal income variable. See Lim and Putnam’s 2010 American Sociological Review
paper for an example of this type of translation being used with church attendance (Lim and Putnam 2010).

same-sex marriage and abortion (Jelen and Wilcox 2003; Ohlander et al. 2005). The controls include sex (female=1), rural/urban (city, suburb, town, rural), region (East, Midwest,
South, West), and race (white, non-white).9 I also include a control for partisan identification, measured as Republican, Independent, and Democrat, as well as a control for religiosity
( 1= “very religious” 0 = “not very religious”).10

Analytic strategy
The primary goals of the analyses are to understand the prevalence of conflicted religionists
overall, to identify the groups most likely to experience attitude conflict, and to identify the
association between conflicted religion and church attendance. To this end, I use bivariate
logistic regression to establish baseline probabilities of experiencing conflict by each key
covariate. I then turn to multivariable analyses to control for demographic factors and
identify the most significant variables predicting same-sex marriage and abortion attitudinal
conflict. All results from logistic regressions are presented as predicted probabilities as
predictions provide optimal interoperability and allow for better cross-model comparisons;
further, as I am interested in the probability of perceived conflict, so predictions present the
results on their “natural scale” (Mize et al. 2019).
I measure the relationship between experiencing conflict and church attendance frequency
with two approaches: First, I simply compare church attendance frequency between conflicted religionists and those not experiencing conflict by regressing church attendance frequency on a dummy variable for experiencing conflict. Second, I compare the difference
between respondent’s current church attendance frequency and his or her church attendance
frequency at age twelve. While not perfect, this approach gives insight into the over-time
dynamics of conflict and its association with church participation11 . As this variable is binary
(1=current attendance is lower than at age 12, 0=current attendance is equal to or greater
than attendance at age 12), I estimate the probability of attending church less frequently
with logistic regression. For both of these approaches, I use coarsened exact matching (CEM)
to robustly identify the associations; because I am concerned with the association between
a single independent variable and an outcome with both of these approaches, rather than
9

Race is dichotomized due to the high correlation between African Americans and Black Protestants.
Including both the race variable with all available categories and religious tradition in multivariable analyses
inflates both the variance and coefficient for Black Protestants. Collapsing the race category avoids this issue
but at the cost of a loss of information. However, given that patterns among racial categories are relatively
null, I believe the dichotomization of the race variable is the appropriate approach to handling the high
collinearity.
10
I do not include a control for income because of severe missingness on this item. Though an unfortunate omission, education provides an adequate measure of socioeconomic status. Moreover, the substantive
findings do not notably change with the inclusion of income as a control.
11
Respondent’s estimates of their past church attendance may be off—either lower or higher–which would
bias the estimated associations. Further, assuming that respondent’s church attendance at age twelve is
accurate, we still cannot establish a causal relationship between perceived conflict and decreased church
attendance, because we do not know the timing of the experienced conflict, not do we know the timing of the
decreased church attendance. Nevertheless, this measure provides another way to capture the association
between perceived conflict and church attendance, along with the simple association between conflicted
religionists and current attendance.

the partial contribution of several covariates, matching allows for the most robust measure
of that association (Morgan and Winship 2014).
Matching is a nonparametric technique used to achieve better balance between “treated”
and “control” groups, thus reducing the confounding influence of control variables in the data.
CEM is a monotonic imbalance bounding matching technique that allows users to explicitly
bound the data ex ante (See Iacus et al. (2009) for more on CEM and its implementation in
STATA.) I run two separate matching procedures for each attendance measure, one for samesex marriage conflict and one for abortion conflict. In each of these models, being a conflicted
religionist is the “treatement.” I then regress both church attendance frequency measures on
each type of conflict with the corresponding matching weights, allowing me to robustly
identify the associations. While matching techniques are typically used in the context of
causal inference, I want to stress here that the data at hand do not allow me to make causal
claims about the relationship between attitude conflict and religious participation12 ; however,
exploiting all available attendance measures, along with matching, does allow for the most
robust identification of this relationship—an important first step for better understanding
attitude conflict and political backlash.
Sampling weights were used in the generation of all descriptive statistics. I do not include
weights, however, for the multivariate analyses, allowing for more precise, unbiased estimates
(Winship and Radbill 1994). As a robustness check, I tested the difference between the
weighted and unweighted coefficients (using the WGTTEST in STATA), as proposed by
Dumouchel and Duncan (1983). The coefficients in each of the unweighted and weighted
models are not significantly different at the 0.05 level, indicating good model specification
and further justifying the exclusion of sampling weights in the multivariate analyses (See
Winship and Radbill (1994)).

I discuss each outcome in turn.
Same-sex marriage attitude conflict
First, about a quarter of people conflict with their churches on same-sex marriage (26%).
This is an initial and important result. It indicates that within the Baylor sample, a sizable
proportion of individuals attend a church that is at odds with their personal views on samesex marriage.
There is a clear association between people’s political ideologies and attitude conflict:

political right to left, with liberals having the highest baseline probability of conflicting at
0.63, compared to conservatives at 0.11. While attenuated, this pattern also holds in the
full model, suggesting the clear importance of political ideology for predicting conflict on
same-sex marriage.
We see interesting differences among religious traditions for conflict on same-sex marriage
attitudes in the baseline model. Catholics and mainline Protestants show substantially larger
probabilities of conflict compared to other religious traditions (Catholics=0.40, mainline
Protestants=0.31), with Catholics showing the largest probability of experiencing conflict.14
As expected, Evangelicals are experiencing conflict the least among religious traditions (0.15),
while 0.17 of religious others are conflicted. About 0.20 of Black Protestants are conflicted.
When controls are added, the gap between Catholics and mainliners disappears, and the
difference between these groups, while still significant, shrinks. Interestingly, the probability
of conflicting increases for Evangelicals in the full model compared to the baseline model,
suggesting that the demographic and political makeup of Evangelicals is driving the baseline
probability of conflicting down.
Surprisingly, the patterns among education levels are not definitive. While those religionists with medium and high levels of education do have higher probabilities of conflicting
compared to those with a low level of education in the baseline model, the difference is slight,
and this difference only gets smaller with the adjusted predictions. If anything, there is a
slight curvilinear pattern in the adjusted model, with those with medium levels of education
predicted to conflict the most.
In both the baseline and full models, there is a relatively flat trend in the probability
of conflicting across the age distribution, with a decline between 18 and 30-year-olds.15
Given the relative strong support among younger Americans for same-sex marriage in 2007,
this trend makes sense. While younger Americans do appear to conflict more, the gap is
smaller than what was expected—overall, there does not appear to be a strong association
between conflict on same-sex marriage and age. (See Appendix C for patterns among control
variables.)
In sum, one’s political views appear to be the strongest predictor of conflict on same-sex
marriage, as we would expect. Evangelicals demonstrate a lower probability of conflicting
compared to mainliners and Catholics, and this difference holds in the adjusted models.
Younger religionists are more likely to experience conflict on same-sex marriage compared
to older religionists, but the relationship is weaker than expected. Finally, there is no clear
trend among levels of educational attainment.

14

There is some evidence of an interaction effect between age and religious tradition, suggesting Catholics
are less likely to conflict as they age, while other religious traditions show smaller or little variation with
age. I do not discuss this finding at length in this paper, as I came to this finding post-hoc and had no prior
theoretical underpinnings as regards religious traditions and age interactions. Moreover, the small counts
within each religious tradition make conclusions about such effects tenuous at best. This could potentially be
an interesting point of study in future research. Graphical representations showing these effects are available
upon request.
15
To allow for more flexibility across the distribution, the age models were estimated with binomial and
cubic polynomial terms. Higher polynomial terms did not add further statistical or substantive value.

Abortion attitude conflict
Conflict on abortion shows similar patterns, with a few notable differences. The overall
proportion of people who conflict is slightly lower at 0.21 (compared to 0.26 for same-sex
marriage). This difference is small but illustrative of the different natures of these two
social issues: More rapidly changing attitudes, such as with same-sex marriage, create more
opportunity for conflict, as attitudinal change at the individual level is more likely to occur.
Consistent with the findings on same-sex marriage, political ideology is the strongest predictor of conflict: Liberals are conflicting the most of any group ( 0.50), followed by markedly
lower probabilities for moderates and conservatives. Compared to same-sex marriage, the
gap between moderates and conservatives is much smaller. This pattern holds in the full
model, with the largest difference being an attenuated prediction for liberals—similar to the
attenuation in the model for same-sex marriage conflict.
Among religious traditions, we see notably different patterns compared to same-sex marriage. First, Black Protestants stand apart as the most likely to experience conflict. This
result makes sense in light of the African-American community’s long-standing support for
14

Bock

abortion rights. The gap between Evangelicals and every other denomination is more notable with abortion compared to same-sex marriage, and this result holds for baseline and
full models. As we would expect, given the church’s clear anti-abortion doctrine, Catholics
demonstrate a lower probability of experiencing conflict on abortion compared to same-sex
marriage—still, nearly a quarter of Catholics in this sample disagree with their church’s
teachings on abortion.
Education shows a similar, null pattern for abortion as with same-sex marriage. There
is a slight increase in probability from low to high education, but these differences are small
for both the adjusted and unadjusted models.
There is a curvilinear trend in the probability of experiencing conflict across the age
distribution, with a peak around 40 years of age. This trend among younger Americans runs
opposite to what is seen here with same-sex marriage: 18 to 30-year-olds are the least likely to
experience conflict on abortion. One possible explanation may, again, rest in the different life
courses of these two social issues, in that abortion is long-running issue on which religionists
have already firmly sorted. While the relationship between same-sex marriage and religious
identity is still in flux in 2007, the central position of abortion in the identities of religionists
is firmly established at this time. Thus, it may be that younger Americans—a group who is
increasingly choosing their religious identities—have simply sorted out of churches who have
more conservative views on abortion. (Again, see Appendix C for patterns among control
variables)
To recap, religionists’ political beliefs and identities are the strongest predictors of experiencing conflict on abortion and same-sex marriage. There are distinct differences among
religious traditions for both issues, with Evangelicals standing apart as especially unlikely to
experience conflict—especially for abortion. Finally, the patterns among young Americans
differ between these two issues: while young Americans are the most likely to conflict on
same-sex marriage, they are the least likely to experience conflict on abortion, pointing to
the different natures of these two issues.

How does conflict relate to church attendance?
I have thus far shown the probabilities of experiencing conflict by each key variable. But
how does conflict associate with church attendance frequency? In the political backlash
model, the expectation is that conflict leads to reduced attendance frequency and, eventually,
disaffiliation altogether. Thus, we would expect conflicted religion to be associated with lower
church attendance frequency. I estimate this association with two different approaches: First,
I estimate the predicted decrease in church attendance frequency for a conflicted religionist
versus a non-conflicted religionist. Next, I display the average marginal effect (AME) of
conflicted religion on decreased church attendance from age 12 (i.e., these estimates show
the difference in probability of attending church less frequently than the respondent did at
age 12 for conflicted religionists versus non-conflicted religionists.)
Figure 2 shows the predicted logged church attendance for a conflicted religionists compared to non-conflicted religionists. As the outcome variable (church attendance frequency)
is logged, a simple transformation of the coefficients allows for a convenient interpretation
of a percent increase or decrease in year number of days attended at church for a conflicted
religionists compared to a non-conflicted religionists: (1−exp(b))∗100. I present results from

three different modeling approaches. The main result, “CEM”, is the coefficient estimated
after the Coarsened Exact Matching process; I include results from two other models: a
baseline estimate from an OLS model without controls and an adjusted estimate model that
includes controls. I include the latter as a point of comparison to demonstrate the correction
done by the CEM model. Estimates are statistically significant at the 95% level if the error
bar does not cross the dashed vertical line at 0%.16
As expected, the coefficients for both same-sex marriage and abortion are negative and
significant at the 0.05 level, indicating lower church attendance for conflicted religionists on
both issues; this result holds in both of the robustness checks, as well. Those conflicted on
same-sex marriage have an estimated 51% lower yearly church attendance rate, and those
conflicted on abortion have an estimated 62% lower yearly church attendance rate. This
is a clear and robust finding that adds support to the proposed mechanism of attitudinal
conflict leading to decreased church involvement (measured here as attendance). Simply
put, a religionist who disagrees with his or her church on abortion or same-sex marriage
is predicted to attend church significantly fewer days each year, a markedly lower level of
religious participation than non-conflicted religionists.
I now turn to my second estimation approach. Figure 3 displays the AME of experiencing
conflict on attending church less frequently than at age 12. As with figure 2, I include
three different models, with the main estimate coming from the CEM model. Again, we
see evidence of a negative association between experiencing conflict and church attendance
frequency for both same-sex marriage and abortion. The probability of attending church
less frequently than at age 12 increases by about 0.18 for same-sex marriage conflict and
about 0.23 for abortion conflict, and both estimates reach significance at the 95% level.
While these results do not allow me to make a causal claim about the relationship between
attitude conflict and church attendance, the associations identified here are consistent with
the proposed mechanism of conflict leading to reduced church involvement (Patrikios 2008).17
The results above demonstrate that experiencing conflict is negatively associated with
church attendance on average. But does this result vary by key covariates? In other words, is
the negative association between experiencing conflict and lower church attendance frequency
conditional on other variables? To test this, Figure 4 plots the results from several models
that regress church attendance frequency on a conflicted religionist X covariate interaction.
As with Figure 2, the y-axis displays the % decrease in church attendance frequency for a
conflicted religionist versus a non-conflicted religionist. Gray bars correspond to predictions
from baseline models without controls, and black bars correspond to predictions from models
with controls. Because cell sizes are relatively small here (and note that the cells sizes
16

The main result is from the OLS estimates of logged church attendance frequency on conflicted religionists. These regressions were run after the CEM process, including the matching weights, and thus the
coefficients represent the adjusted association of conflicted religion and attendance. Each conflict variable
was matched on age, sex, region, urban/rural, education, political orientation, party identification, religious
tradition, and religiosity. The CEM process produced greater balance on both conflict variables; L1 provides
a measure of balance on covariates, and thus a reduction in L1 after the matching process indicates greater
balance. Same-sex marriage conflict had an L1 reduction of 0.079 , and abortion conflict had an L1 reduction
of 0.0745.
17
Note that AME in the adjusted model for same-sex marriage just fails to meet significance at the 95%
level. Considering the difference from the results of the CEM model, this is likely an indication of substantial
imbalance among covariates in this model compared to the abortion model.

drastically vary across categories due to the dispersion of conflicted religionists in the sample),
most of these predictions fail to meet statistical significance, and I have omitted errors to
avoid distraction.18 I thus interpret these results with caution, but the descriptive patterns
are revealing, nonetheless.
Overall, the negative association between experiencing conflict and church attendance
holds across these subgroups, with the one exception of Black Protestants, who actually
have higher church attendance if they conflict with their church on same-sex marriage. Interestingly, the pattern among political orientation categories differs between abortion and
same-sex marriage. For abortion, there appears to be a steady decline in the negative association between conflict and church attendance going form the political right to left. In
other words, if a religionist is conservative and disagrees with her church on abortion, she
is predicted to attend church less frequently compared to political liberals. Finally, there
appears to be an interaction between age and experiencing conflict, with younger conflicted
religionists attending church less frequently than older conflicted religionists. I discuss these
results more below.

Conflicted Religionists

Discussion and Conclusion
For decades, the conventional wisdom among scholars of American religion has been that a
restructuring took place in the post-war era in which new outlets (new sects and religious
groups) were created, reflecting a diversifying group of religionists (Wuthnow 1988). As
such, religionists—we would expect—would have selected into churches with which they have
attitudinal agreement. Yet, over the past few decades, we have seen a rapid increase in the
number of nonreligious people, and some have pointed to political backlash as the culprit for
the unexpected rate of disaffiliation (Djupe et al. 2018b; Hout and Fischer 2014; Patrikios
2008; Hout and Fischer 2002) . While recent work has advanced the political backlash
model by emphasizing lower-level processes (Djupe et al. 2018b,a), the role of disagreement
on specific, salient issues has been underemphasized. This paper adds to the growing body
of work that studies political backlash at the congregational level by analyzing “conflicted
religionists” and this group’s association with church attendance. The results demonstrate
several important findings.

Measuring conflicted religionists
Political orientation is clearly the most important factor for predicting whether or not someone is a conflicted religionist. Moreover, conservatives are unlikely to conflict with their
churches on these issues. In discordance with expectations of the restructuring model, these
dissenters have not filtered into churches with more liberal views but have rather remained
(for now) conflicted religionists. Moreover, the fact that conservatives are conflicting very
little with their churches on these important issues suggests that American religion may
increasingly be represented by political and religious conservatives—a consequential pattern
for religion and politics in the U.S. (Schnabel and Bock 2018, 2017).
In line with other recent work, the results suggest that the most important denominational distinction in the United States may be between Evangelicals and everyone else.
Even after controlling for political ideology and other variables, Evangelicals stand apart
from other groups as the least conflicted religionists. Compared to other denominations,
few evangelicals disagree with their churches on these keys issues. This is consistent with
the well-documented finding in longitudinal studies that relatively few Evangelicals have
disaffiliated over the past several decades (Schnabel and Bock 2018, 2017). As Schnabel and
Bock (2018, 2017) have argued, the result has been an American religious landscape that
has become increasingly polarized along religious “intensity” lines, with moderate religion
steadily declining and “intense” religion persisting.
Beyond the important Evangelical/non-Evangelical distinction, the findings regarding
Catholics should also be noted. Catholics were the only group to have a significantly higher
predicted level of conflict on same-sex marriage compared to Evangelicals. This finding is
in line with the unparalleled disaffiliation (Hout and Fischer 2014) and overall changing
sentiments among Catholics (Smith et al. 2014). It is also possible that the apparent conflict
among Catholics is not necessarily due to unique attitudinal changes but rather is the result of
a lack of congregational variety. Compared to Mainline Protestants, for instance, dissenting
Catholics do not have an outlet within the Catholic church and are thus forced to either (1)
remain as a conflicted religionists, (2) switch out of the Catholic church, or (3) disaffiliate
19

Bock

Conflicted Religionists

from religion altogether. Yet, while Catholics do stand out on same-sex marriage conflict, it
should be noted that Catholics do not statistically differ from Mainline Protestants across
both issues, suggestive of the sort of denominational converging argued by Wuthnow (1988).
While the probability of experiencing conflict on same-sex marriage is highest among
younger Americans, there is a curvilinear relationship between age and conflict on abortion.
In fact, younger Americans are the least likely to experience conflict on abortion. Likewise,
highly education religionists are not particularly likely to experience conflict on either issue.
Why might this be? One scenario could be that most of the young Americans and the
highly educated with more liberal views have already disaffiliated, thus leaving a small
proportion of these people in conservative churches. Consequentially, there would be fewer
young and highly educated people left to conflict. This scenario is supported by what we
know about disaffiliation trends—younger Americans and the highly educated are among
the most likely groups to have disaffiliated in the past few decades (Hout and Fischer 2014,
2002). This scenario is also supported by the data used in this study: 18-30 year-olds make
up the largest proportion of the nonreligious. Another possible explanation is that young
Americans and the highly educated are more likely to have switched into churches with
which they share more progressive same-sex marriage views. This seems especially likely for
higher educated people, as they have been shown to be more likely to select their churches
rather than remaining in the church of their parents, for example (Schwadel 2011). This
scenario is also supported by the data from this study: higher educated people, by far,
make up the largest percentage of those in churches with more liberal views. Thus, this
explanation would suggest that perhaps along age and educational lines, Wuthnow’s (1988)
denominational filtering remains true.

Conflicted religionists, salient issues, and declined church attendance
The political backlash model posits that attitudinal conflict can eventually lead to disaffiliation. Given that the available data is a single cross-section, I am unable make claims
about conflict leading to eventual disaffiliation. However, I have proposed here that while
we cannot observe disaffiliation, we could reasonably expect the effects of attitudinal conflict to take place gradually, whereby conflicted religionists demonstrate decreased religious
participation before possibly disaffiliating altogether. In this instance, conflicted religion is
a stepping-stone to disaffiliation. The results show a clear and strong association between
attitudinal conflict and lower church attendance, for both abortion and same-sex marriage
conflict. Moreover, this negative association is fairly stable across key covariates with a
few notables exceptions. The negative association between conflict on abortion and church
attendance appears to be stronger among conservatives compared to liberals. This is an
unexpected finding but is broadly consistent with Djupe et al. (2018b)’s finding that backlash to the Christian Right primarily occurred among Republican Evangelicals because they
were the most likely to be confronted with politics of the Christian Right. Perhaps conservative conflicted religionists tend to attend churches in which abortion politics are made more
salient in their congregations compared to liberal religionists.19 The negative association
19

Again, given the small cell sizes, I am cautious to draw any strong conclusions about these results.

20

between church attendance and conflict is also notably higher among younger Americans for
both abortion and same-sex marriage. So while younger Americans are not more likely to
experience conflict on abortion compared to older Americans, if they do, it may affect their
religious participation much more strongly.
Taken together, these analyses bolster the political backlash hypothesis: disagreeing with
one’s church on important issues, such as same-sex marriage and abortion, is associated with
lower church participation (measured here as church attendance). While past studies have
demonstrated the mechanism of political disagreement for disaffiliation at the congregational
level, I have argued that they underemphasize the importance of specific issues for this process. Different patterns among conflicted religionists on abortion and same-sex marriage
point to the fact that political disagreement can take place along several dimensions and
occur differently for different religionists. Rather than broad political disagreement (Djupe
and Gilbert 2008), opposition to the ”Christian Right” (Hout and Fischer 2014, 2002), or
contention with Republican party politics (Patrikios 2008), political backlash may occur as
a process of religionists experiencing irreconcilable conflict with their congregation on salient
issues that are important to them. A focus on conflict over salient issues provides a broader
lens for understanding political backlash—one that takes into account the relationship between political-cultural change and churches’ responses to change. The issue of same-sex
marriage highlights this point. There was unprecedented rapid change in support for samesex marriage (Powell et al. 2010), which created the perfect conditions for increased numbers
of conflicted religionists: An increased share of the population had pro-same-sex marriage
views, while the doctrines of most religionists’ churches had not adapted accordingly—the
cultural change occurred too quickly.
While the political backlash literature has focused on the influence of the Christian
Right to explain recent disaffiliation trends, my analysis and emphasis on salient issues
suggests that any socio-political issue has the potential to drive backlash if the conditions
are right. And thus the cycle of political backlash my continue to occur in the future,
but perhaps with a different set of salient issues. Further, as has been well established, the
current political backlash has occurred primarily among political liberals, and it is likely that
this trend will continue: Increasingly progressive views are often at odds with traditional
doctrine in organized religion, and so it will likely continue to be political liberals who
experience conflict and eventually disaffiliate. Such a process would result in the continued
“exceptional” (compared to other wealthy democracies) American religious landscape that
is primarily concentrated by the most ardent practitioners and believers (Schnabel and Bock
2018, 2017).

Limitations and future research
There are several limitations to this study that should be noted. First, while I believe
measuring the relationship between conflicted religionists and church attendance allows for
the best available assessment of the consequences of attitude conflict, I cannot make causal
claims about this relationship. I have used matching techniques—usually used in the causal
inference framework—to robustly identify the association of interest, but that does not preclude the possibility of endogeneity concerns. It could be that conflicted religionists do not
become conflicted and then attend church less often but that certain religionists already at21

tend church less often and then develop conflicting attitudes more easily because they are not
as attached to the church. While this is an important concern, it does not obfuscate the association found here: that conflicting with one’s church is associated with lower participation.
Regardless of the causal direction, this association points to the apparent incompatibility
of holding social views that are at odds with the teachings of one’s church and maintaining
strong participation with said church.
Second, the data used in this study are from 2007, but there have been some important
legal and social changes since that time: Same-sex marriage approval has increased substantially, and, most importantly, it has become legal at the national level. If anything, then,
the estimates of the prevalence of attitude conflict provided in the present study may be
conservative. Nevertheless, the aim of this study is to emphasize the importance of salient
issues for the process of political backlash. As such, any point in time since the beginning of
the recent wave of political backlash (the early 1990s) serves as a good sample frame with
which to study this phenomenon. What matters is the particular issues analyzed and their
relevant saliency at the time point studied. In this case, 2007 serves as an ideal time to study
same-sex marriage beliefs and their role in backlash, given the topic’s growing prominence
in social and political discourse at that time (Powell et al. 2010).
Third, while the theoretical framework discussed throughout the paper is concerned with
attitude conflict eventually leading to disaffiliation, that is not a necessary process—it may be
that conflicted religionists won’t necessarily disaffiliate. Hirchman’s (1970) concept of “Exit,
Voice, and Loyalty” provides a good framing for the potential paths of a conflicted religionist:
She may experience conflict and leave the church all together (“Exit”); She may attempt to
stay but change the teachings or the views of the church on the issue on which she is conflicted
(”Voice”); Or, she may remain in the church while continuing to experience conflict, as the
religious identity/participation is too important to abandon (“Loyalty”). This study has
focused on the first path, “Exit”, but the other two paths would certainly be interesting points
of study and have consequences for our understanding of religious change and participation.
Studies of these alternate paths could ask such questions as: Do some religionists remain
in a liminal phase between belonging and disaffiliating? If so, why? What are the reasons
for a conflicted religionist remaining in a church with which they conflict? Why do some
religionists experience conflict and have no measurable decline in religious participation?
Another vein of future study could incorporate in-depth interviews in order to better capture
the cognitive dissonance that comes from being a conflicted religionist—how does one resolve
political-religious conflict? Finally, future studies might consider other salient social issues
on which individuals may conflict, such as environmentalism, cohabitation, pre-martial sex,
and marijuana legalization, to name a few.
As political culture inevitably changes, and socio-political attitudes necessarily change
along with it, there will continue to be opportunity for conflict between religionists and
churches. In order to fully understand the political and religious landscape of the United
States and elsewhere, social scientists must continue to study this evolving phenomenon.

Conflicted Religionists

Appendix D. Patterns for conflicted religionists in “liberal” churches
Figure D1 displays frequencies of conflicted religionists who have more conservative views
on abortion and same-sex marriage and their current church. While the there are too few
cases among religionists conflicted on abortion, there are some interesting, yet not surprising,
patterns for same-sex marriage. First, mainliners far and way have the highest number of
conflicted religionists, which makes sense given the higher number of more liberal mainline
churches. Religionists with high levels of education also appear to be much more likely to
experience conflict. This is an interesting result, and I’m not sure what to make of it. It
could be that religionists with higher levels of education are more likely to attend liberal
churches, regardless of whether or not they agree with said church politically.
Figure D2 plots the mean logged church attendance frequency for conflicted religionists
compared to non-conflicted religionists. There is a clear pattern for same-sex marriage, with
conflicted religionists having a far lower average church attendance frequency. This finding
suggests that conflicted religion is associated with lower church attendance, regardless of the
politics of the church or religionists.
