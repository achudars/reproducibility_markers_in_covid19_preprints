Abstract
Background. The lack of established measurement tools in the study of menstrual health and
hygiene has been a significant limitation of quantitative studies to date. However, there has been
limited exploration of existing measurement to identify avenues for improvement.
Methods. We undertook two linked systematic reviews of (1) trials of menstrual health
interventions and their nested studies in low- and middle-income countries, (2) studies developing
or validating measures of menstrual experiences from any location. Systematic searching was
undertaken in 12 databases, together with handsearching. We iteratively grouped and audited
concepts measured across included studies and extracted and compared measures of each concept.
Results. A total of 29 trials, 9 nested studies and 22 measure development studies were included.
Trials measured a range of outcomes including menstrual knowledge, attitudes, and practices,
school absenteeism, and health. Most measure validation studies focused on assessing attitudes
towards menstruation, while a group of five studies assessed the accuracy of women’s recall of their
menstrual characteristics such as timing and cycle length. Measures of menstrual knowledge,
attitudes, beliefs and restrictions were inconsistent and frequently overlapped. No two studies
measured the same menstrual or hygiene practices, with 44 different practices assessed. This audit
provides a summary of current measures and extant efforts to pilot or test their performance.
Conclusions. Inconsistencies in both the definition and operationalisation of concepts measured in
menstrual health and hygiene research should be addressed. To improve measurement, authors
should clearly define the constructs they aim to measure and outline how these were
operationalised for measurement. Results of this audit indicate the need for the development and
validation of new measures, and the evaluation of the performance of existing measures across
contexts. In particular, the definition and measurement of menstrual practices, knowledge,
attitudes, norms and restrictions should be addressed.

Introduction
Menstruation is a recurring experience in the lives of millions of women and adolescent girls
across the globe. This natural process has gained increased attention for its role in female health and
social participation in recent years, following a history of neglect and silence. Policy and
programming have rapidly expanded seeking to address unmet menstrual needs. This response has
far outstripped the pace and funding of research to understand menstrual experiences and inform
and evaluate interventions.[1] A growing body of qualitative research has highlighted the challenges
faced by menstruating women and adolescent girls in low-resource settings and indicated negative
effects on health, education, employment, and well-being. These studies have also highlighted a
complex array of factors contributing to experiences of menstruation.[2] Quantitative studies testing
risk factors or consequences hypothesized through qualitative research are rare, and systematic
reviews of quantitative and trial research have highlighted the limited number and low quality of
extant studies.[3-5]
A significant challenge for quantitative research of menstrual health has been a lack of
clarity around core concepts and a paucity of measurement tools to capture them. In 2016,
Hennegan and Montgomery highlighted this inconsistency in the measurement of outcomes across
trials, as well as the absence of relevant menstrual health measures to capture experiences as a key
barrier to improved trials of interventions. Similarly, in mapping the knowledge of menstrual health
and hygiene across study designs, Chandra-Mouli and Patel [6] noted that “vague measures are
often used to describe the menstrual experiences of girls, which impede data aggregation and direct
comparisons.” In proposing research agendas for menstrual health, many have called for improved
clarity in the measures used, refinement of concept definitions, consistency in outcomes assessed,
and the development and validation of new measures where needed.[7-9] While past reviews and
research priority papers have highlighted measurement challenges as barriers, none have reviewed
existing measures to provide an appraisal of current use and gaps.
The present study seeks to inform improved measurement in the rapidly emerging field of
menstrual health by auditing extant measurement. We aimed to describe the current concepts
assessed in studies of interventions and identify the measures that have been used to capture core
concepts. Two linked, simultaneous systematic reviews were undertaken. Review A included trials of
menstrual health interventions in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), as well as studies
nested within those trials. The aim of the first review was to identify the concepts and outcomes
measured in studies of interventions, supplemented by nested studies which may provide further
explorations of menstrual experiences, measures, intervention theory of change or process
evaluation. Review B collated and appraised studies developing, validating or testing tools to
measure menstrual experiences across geographies. This second review aimed to identify the
concepts for which measures have been developed, compare these to the measures of menstrual
experience used in trials, and to highlight lessons learned from measure development and
validation.
Together, this work provides an overview and appraisal of current measurement in
menstrual health and hygiene research and develops recommendations for pathways forward.

Methods
The review protocol is registered on PROSPERO: [CRD42018089884] and is reported
according to PRISMA guidance (Supplementary Materials 1).

Search strategy and selection criteria
Two systematic searches were undertaken in English, reported in Box 1. Trial searches were
conducted in the following 12 databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL),
Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), ProQuest Dissertation and
theses, Embase, Global Health, Medline, Open Grey, Popline, PsycINFO, Social Sciences Full Text,
Socoiological Abstracts, WHO Global Health Library. In addition, we screened the first 20 pages of
Google Scholar results, and trial registries: Clinical Trials Registry, Pan African Trials Registry, Trials
Register of Promoting Health Interventions (TRoPHI). To identify nested studies, we undertook
vertical searching of reference lists and citations of included trials. Searches for measure
development and validation studies were undertaken in the same databases but excluded CENTRAL
and trial registries.
We searched the reference lists and citations of two past systematic reviews [3, 4] as well as
a report reviewing the state of menstrual health research.[10] To identify grey literature, we
searched online databases specific to menstrual health, hygiene and sanitation: Menstrual Health
Hub, Menstrual Hygiene Day ‘Resources’, and Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA library).
Further we searched the websites of key organisations undertaking work in menstrual health:
Oxfam, PATH, Plan International, Save the Children, UNICEF, UNFPA, UN Women, WaterAid,
WASHUnited, WSSCC.
Initial searches were undertaken in English in March 2018 and updated in July 2019. Titles
and abstracts were independently screened by two reviewers using EPPI-reviewer 4, with full text
screening undertaken by the first author.

Review A: Trials audit
Inclusion criteria for trial design were consistent with those applied in a past systematic
review of menstrual health and hygiene intervention studies [3]. Randomized and non-randomized
trials which included a control group (including controlled before-after studies) were eligible for
inclusion.[11] Trials were eligible if they evaluated the effectiveness of interventions designed to
improve the menstrual experiences of women or girls. Interventions could include interventions
such as puberty education or social programs designed to improve social support or reduce
menstrual stigma. Interventions providing supportive resources and environments were also eligible,
such as the provision of menstrual products or improvements to water, sanitation and hygiene
(WASH) infrastructure aimed at improving menstrual experiences. We included studies that
compared the acceptability, comfort or experience of using different menstrual products when they
met study design criteria. Nested studies were eligible if they included quantitative data on the
menstrual experiences or environments of participants. Nested qualitative studies were not eligible.
Studies of menstrual experiences nested in trials which did not meet inclusion criteria, or trials not
yet reported (e.g., only baseline data available) were not included. Studies including women and girls
of reproductive or pre-reproductive age in low- and middle-income countries were eligible.[12] We
were unable to include studies that were not available in English or Spanish.

Review B: Measure studies
Studies were eligible if they reported on the development and validation, or tested the
performance of, measures of menstrual experiences. The aim of this review was to inform future
measurement in the study of menstrual health and hygiene in low-resource settings and we sought
to identify any measures of menstrual management behaviours, attitudes, knowledge or the impact
of menstruation on quality of life. Because our focus was on supporting menstrual experience at a
population level, we excluded measures designed to diagnose menstrual disorders such as
endometriosis or heavy menstrual bleeding. Measures that focused on symptoms associated with
hormonal cycling, that is, physical symptoms associated with menstruation, were also excluded.
Similarly, we excluded measures of the experiences of disorders of the menstrual cycle including:
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), dysmenorrhea, or endometriosis. We excluded measures of the

5

acceptability of menstrual suppression or experiences of menopause. Studies from any country were
eligible.

Analysis and quality appraisal
Review A and Review B study data were extracted using piloted forms by one reviewer and
checked by a second. For Review A we extracted concepts measured as described by each study’s
authors and iteratively grouped the concepts measured. Within each grouping we summarized the
ways different concepts had been described and measured. Where described we extracted measure
specifics, such as piloting or validation, question wording or recall periods, to further inform
comparisons.
Through Review B we collated the measures developed to date and the contexts in which
these had been assessed. Included measure studies ranged from those assessing the accuracy of
single self-report questions, to those developing scales relating to latent constructs. Where latent
constructs had been described, we extracted authors’ definitions and any subscales along with
example items from the measures. We grouped Review B measures according to the iterative
conceptual groupings developed in Review A. This enabled us to describe the availability of
measures for the concepts of focus in intervention research. We supplemented this comparison with
brief summary of the performance of the developed measures and the concepts studies used to
establish convergent, discriminant or predictive validity.

Included Studies
Characteristics of included studies are summarized in Table 1 and Table 2.
Among the trial studies, 13 tested effects of education interventions, 8 tested product
provision interventions or compared comfort and acceptability of different products (n=4), and two
tested combined education and product provision. Products tested included disposable and reusable
pads (n=6), menstrual cups (n=2) and a combination of pads and cups (n=2). Most studies focused on
girls in schools or of school age (n=18), with an additional 2 studies undertaken with university
students. One study exclusively concerned girls who reported experiencing menstrual pain. One
study sought to provide training for adolescents with mild intellectual disability (IQ 50-70) and their
parents. No other studies reported including participants with disabilities. Nested studies explored
intervention effects and menstrual experiences in more detail, with study aims reported in Table 1.
Of measure development studies, 11 developed a scale or item set to measure a defined
latent construct, 6 investigated the performance, revalidation or a new language version of an
existing measure, and 5 evaluated the accuracy of self-reported menstrual characteristics such as
the date of menarche. Six studies were published before 2000, nine in the 2000’s and a further
seven since 2016. More studies were conducted in North America than in other regions (n=10),
followed by Europe (n=4). There were two studies each with samples from Iran and India, and single
studies undertaken in Turkey, El-Salvador and the Philippines, Belize, Mexico and Israel. Many
studies were undertaken with girls in schools (n=9), and university students (n=8).

Concepts measured across included studies
From Review A we included measures used as outcomes as well as those used descriptively
to contextualise participant experiences and in nested studies. Concepts described by each study’s
authors, their methods of assessment and a brief summary of measure development or validation
efforts are reported in Supplementary Materials 2. Most measures were designed by investigators
for the purpose of their individual study, with some referring to external experts or past research to
inform questions. Eight trials reported piloting measures prior to data collection or were themselves
pilots to assess the feasibility of the measures tested. To describe and compare measures we
iteratively grouped concepts measured across studies, displayed in Table 3.
From Review B we extracted the measures developed, their sub-scales and example items
from each, reported in Table 4. To compare developed measures from Review B with measures in
trials (Review A) we highlight in Table 4 where measures, or sub-scales within measures, assess
concepts corresponding to those in trials and nested studies. For studies developing or testing scales
we extracted reported tests of dimensionality, reliability and validity and report these in
Supplementary Materials 3. Across scale development and validation studies most investigated
measure factor structure, although many employed only exploratory factor analysis. Internal
consistency was reported for most measures as the sole test of reliability. Of the 11 studies testing
new measures, only three reported test-retest reliability. Most studies appraised face and content
validity through expert and participant input, or comparison to qualitative study findings. Far fewer
studies included further quantitative validation such as tests of convergent, discriminant or
predictive validity. This evidenced the lack of a clear nomological network, theory about the
interrelationship between constructs and their measures, to guide the selection of related
constructs. One measure of attitudes assessed relationships between the scale and mental health,
self-esteem and locus of control.[71] While a second tested relationships with selfobjectification.[68] A final instrument testing a broad menstrual health construct, assessed criterion
validity against self-reported menstrual symptoms and quality of life measures.[69]
Audit of measures used across included studies are reported according to the groupings in
Table 3.

Measurement construct(s) and subscales with example items

Review A concept(s)

The questionnaire was developed to measure multidimensional menstrual-related attitudes; both positive and negative. The
tool aimed “to explore the nature of women's attitudes toward menstruation and to examine possible dimensions or styles of
coping related to menstruation.” Authors also developed an adolescent-friendly version of the questions (MAQ-A). Items
informed by past research, and ideas of balance across negative and positive phrasings as well as four pre-hypothesised attitude
groups.

Menstrual attitudes,
beliefs, norms and
restrictions

The measure has five factors/sub-scales. Menstruation as:
1) A debilitating event (e.g., “Avoiding certain activities during menstruation is often very wise”)
2) A natural event (e.g., “Menstruation provides a way for me to keep in touch with my body”)
3) A bothersome event (e.g., “Menstruation is something I just have to put up with”)
4) An event whose onset can be predicted and anticipated (e.g., “I have learned to anticipate my menstrual period by the mood
changes which precede it”)
5) An event that does not and should not affect one's behaviour (e.g., “Premenstrual tension/irritability is all in a woman’s
head”)

The measure has four sub-scales:
1) Danger (e.g., “Women should not hold positions of power or authority because of mood changes during the menstrual cycle”)
2) Stigma (e.g., “Menstruation should be kept secret”)
3) Superstition (e.g., “Women should not cook while menstruating”)
4) Disability (e.g., “Menstruation is a significant cause of absence from work or school for women”)
Designed to measure adolescents’ attitudes towards menstruation both before and after menarche. Hypothesised domains
were informed by qualitative study of adolescent reactions to menarche.

Beliefs about and
Attitudes Toward
Menstruation

Marvan 2006
(Mexico)[64]

Final factors (sub-scales) were:
1) Positive Feelings (e.g., “I feel proud when I have my period/I will feel proud when I get my period”)
2) Negative Feelings (e.g., “I worry a lot about periods starting unexpectedly/I worry a lot about my periods starting”)
3) Living with Menstruation (e.g., “Girls with periods should avoid exercise”)
4) Openness (e.g., “I like to talk about periods with my friends”)
5) Acceptance of Menarche (e.g., “Coping with periods is easy”)
6) Menstrual Symptoms (e.g., “Menstruating girls are grumpy and tense”)
This measure was designed to assess attitudes of men and women towards menstruation. Authors designed the measure not to
include any personal statements and include beliefs about activities women should and should not do while menstruating. Items
were developed through review of literature on myths, stereotypes and attitudes.

(US)[68]

Initial development indicated five factors:
1) Secrecy (e.g., “It is important to discuss the topic of the period at school with boys and girls together”)
2) Annoyance (e.g., “It is annoying for women to have the period every month”)
3) Proscriptions and prescriptions (e.g., “Women must avoid exercising while they are having their periods”)
4) Disability (e.g., “The period affects women’s abilities to do housework”)
5) Pleasant (e.g., “There are women who feel content to have their periods”)
Measure developed to measure women’s attitudes and emotions towards menstruation. The measure used two subscales from
the MAQ, with six new items added for this scale.
Four factors (sub-scales) emerged:
1) Menstruation as Bothersome (as appears in the MAQ)
2) Menstruation as Disgusting or Shameful (e.g., “I would feel ashamed if I “leaked” menstrual blood on my clothes”)
3) Menstruation as Enabling Awareness of One’s Body (e.g., “Menstruation is a reoccurring affirmation of womanhood”)
4) Menstruation as Life Affirming (e.g., “The recurrent monthly flow of menstruation is an external indication of a woman’s
general good health”)

Designed to measure self-care in relation to sexual and reproductive health, and to capture constructs influencing reproductive
and sexual self-care such as interactions with parents, knowledge and attitudes. Items were informed by a qualitative study and
past research.
The final tool has seven factors/sub-scales:
1) Adolescents and family interaction (e.g., “My father/mother welcome that I raise my issues with them”)
2) The perception of female adolescents of premarital sexual relationships (e.g., “I think that having sexual relationships with a
boyfriend is a sin”)
3) Enabling factors for sexual and reproductive self-care (e.g., “Access to healthcare services such as visits to a gynaecologist or
midwife, a psychologist and a nutritionist etc. enhances my ability for reproductive and sexual health self-care”)
4) Understanding and behaviours of female adolescents of the interaction with the opposite sex (e.g., “Because of my
adherence to family principles, I refrain from having a relationship with a boy”)
5) Parent-adolescent communication barriers (e.g., “I do not want to talk with my mother/father about issues related to the
opposite sex/puberty and menstrual cycle, so that our respect is preserved”)
6) Reproductive and sexual knowledge (e.g., “Genital ulcers are a sign of STDs”)
7) Self-care for reproductive health and menstruation (e.g., “If I cannot dry my underwear in the sun, I use a hot iron”)
Developed to measure menstrual health-seeking behaviours, informed by the theory of planned behaviour (TPB). Items were
designed to assess constructs across the TPB for menstrual health behaviours. The measure was informed by past measures and
qualitative study.
Final factors (sub-scales) were:
1) Attitudes towards menstrual health (e.g., “Menstruation causes difficulties in concentrating on some activities such as
education”)
2) Subjective norms (e.g., “My family believes that I should continue my social activities during menstruation”)
3) Perceived behavioural control (e.g., “I can take a shower during my menstrual period”)
4) Perceived parental control (e.g., “My parents determine how much I should read about the puberty health-related issues”)
5) Behavioural intention (e.g., “I have decided to frequently change my menstrual pad during my menstrual period”)
6) Menstrual health behaviours (e.g., “I don’t go to the sea and the pool during my menstrual period”; “I would use cotton
underclothes during my menstrual period”)

3 questions were tested, assessing: the availability of a private location for washing during menstruation, access to menstrual
materials (and the type of menstrual materials), and the method of disposal of menstrual materials.

Menstrual practices

A tool to measure menstrual hygiene management was designed to support evaluation of a menstrual health and hygiene
intervention. Items were drawn from past definitions of menstrual hygiene, past studies and frameworks within the literature.
Items largely concerned behavioural practices and menstrual environments.

Menstrual practices

Following principal components analysis, authors proposed two factors/sub-scales:
1) Menstrual health (e.g., “What kind of menstrual absorbent do you use?”)
2) Menstrual hygiene (e.g., “Is there a separate bathing place at home?”)
Designed to measure menstrual health, authors note that the measure sought to assess menstrua health more holistically
beyond clinical dysmenorrhea or premenstrual symptoms. Item pool was developed through literature review.

Menstrual
characteristics

The measure includes five factors:
1) Affective symptoms (e.g, “I have mood swings during my period”)
2) Somatic symptoms and school life (e.g., “I have lower abdominal pain or discomfort during my period”)
3) Daily habits for menstrual health (e.g., “I have dietary habits of eating less salty food and taking less caffeine”)
4) Menstrual cycle characteristics (e.g., “I have healthy menstrual cycles and periods”)
5) Attitudes and perceptions on menstruation (e.g., “I think menstruation is an important indicator of women’s overall health”)
Impact of menstruation on school and well-being

Menstrual and hygiene practices
Review A
Of 32 included trials and nested studies, 19 reported measuring different practices
undertaken to manage menses. These were typically referred to as ‘menstrual practices’, ‘menstrual
hygiene’, ‘menstrual behaviours’ or ‘hygiene behaviours.’ Eight trials included changes to menstrual
practices as outcomes, making this the second most common trial outcome measure. Seven trials
used menstrual and hygiene practice data to describe samples, while 5 nested studies reported on
practices as part of their core research question. The list of behaviours and practices included in
studies as menstrual and hygiene practices are reported in Table 5 for Review A and B studies. These
do not include indexes from three studies which collapsed across an unknown set of items.[20, 43,
46] Further, in two studies, authors included attending school or university, and participating in
religious practices during menstruation [16], and food restrictions and exercise [18] as menstrual
practices. These fit poorly with those reported as hygiene behaviours in other studies and are not
included in Table 5.
There was no consistent definition of menstrual or hygiene practices across studies, even
among those using such concepts as trial outcomes. Djalalinia et al. [17] defined menstrual hygiene
as “bathing and washing during the period of menstruation after each urination and defecation, and
use of sanitary pad or cotton”, while Leventhal et al. [21] defined menstrual hygiene as the use of
menstrual products and the frequency of changing products. For adolescents with mild intellectual
disability, Sener and colleagues [41] evaluated menstrual hygiene as bathing practices, and
observational assessment of demonstrating placing a menstrual product on a doll. Shesthra et al.
[44] used menstrual practices to balance across intervention and control groups at baseline,
implying hygiene as the menstrual materials used and if respondents had ever used sanitary pads.
In nested studies, the menstrual and hygiene behaviours of focus were defined by the study
objectives. Both Nyothach et al.[35] and Oduor et al.[36] investigated hand washing before and after
changing menstrual cups as ‘handwashing for menstrual hygiene’ and the frequency of dropping
menstrual products and subsequent cleaning or management of those products, respectively. In one
nested study, [31] authors based the assessment of menstrual hygiene on a pre-existing definition
[74] to report the prevalence of the concept and its association with other outcomes.
Very few studies reported the questions used to asses menstrual and hygiene practices.
Thus, it was unclear what the recall periods, question structures, and response options were for
most studies. Five studies disclosed the self-report questions used for core practices assessed.[21,
30, 31, 35, 36] Among these, ‘usual’ practice was most commonly assessed, with some asking for
ordinal responses (‘always’, ‘sometimes’, ‘never’) to characterise their practice. Two studies used
‘this recent period’ as the recall period.[35, 36]
Two studies included insights on the reliability of menstrual and hygiene practices questions
used. van Eijk 2018 [38] found poor agreement between self-reported menstrual cup use and cup
use measured by observed change of the cup colour (kappa=0.044). Womena 2018 [50] reported
that quantitative survey responses in which respondents reported washing their materials with soap
and water contradicted qualitative accounts wherein participants reported inadequate access to
soap for washing.

18

Review B
Among measure development studies, two focused on measuring menstrual hygiene.[63,
67] An additional two measures included menstrual health or hygiene behaviours as subscales.[51,
58] Where reported in studies, the practices measured in these scales are included in Table 5.
Menstrual hygiene. As part of the development of new measures for the Multiple Indicator
Cluster Surveys (MICS)[75], Khan and colleagues[63] field tested questions on menstrual hygiene.
They undertook cognitive interviews with respondents and focus group discussions with
interviewers administering the surveys. Results indicated that for the three menstrual questions
asked, in 38-52% of cases interviewers needed to clarify the questions or probe to elicit responses.
Cognitive interviews suggested that the term ‘washing’ may have been interpreted by respondents
to infer bathing, while the term ‘privacy’ was understood differently among respondents in
interviews. In focus groups, interviewers suggested that ‘materials’ was not consistently perceived to
mean a menstrual absorbent.
Menstrual hygiene management scale. Ramaiya [67] developed a menstrual hygiene
measure based on a past framework, and included domains of: use of menstrual absorbents (cloth,
sanitary pad) and hygiene behaviours, which included genital washing, handwashing and bathing
daily (see Table 5). Items were reported along with the categorisation of practices as ‘adequate’,
‘semi-adequate’ or ‘inadequate’ menstrual hygiene. Factors at baseline and endline differed with
items all loading on individual factors in final analysis. The author suggested that revised
understandings of the constructs were needed.
In two broad measures of ‘reproductive self-care’[51] and ‘menstrual health seeking
behaviours’[58], sub-scales included measures of menstrual self-care practices. The former included
the subscale ‘Self-care for reproductive health and menstruation’, this included the menstrual
practices listed in Table 5, along with items that fit more poorly with menstrual hygiene practices
reported in most Review A studies including: using iron pills, recording the dates of the menstrual
period, using painkillers to manage menstrual pain, and monitoring menstrual blood loss. The latter
measure assessed menstrual health seeking across constructs from the theory of planned behaviour
(TPB) and included a subscale on behaviours. Alongside the practices listed in Table 5, authors
included items reported to capture menstrual health behaviours including; avoiding swimming in
pools during menses, avoiding caffeine and reducing aggression during menstruation. These items
evidenced inconsistencies in the boundaries of self-care behaviours, restrictions during
menstruation and hygiene practices.

Knowledge
Review A
Knowledge about menstruation and puberty was the most frequent outcome assessed in
trials (n=10). A further two studies reported measuring menstrual knowledge for descriptive
purposes. Knowledge was assessed through tests.
The content of knowledge assessments varied, as did the level of detail provided by authors
about the topics covered. Although noting expert or text-book input into knowledge measures, four
studies provided no information on the content included in the tests.[13, 16, 42, 43] For the studies
that did provide example questions or indicate the coverage of knowledge content there was a wide
range. The indication that menstruation was a physical process, the age of onset of menarche, and
the origin of menstrual blood as the female reproductive tract (uterus, through the vagina) were
common across studies. Some studies broadened biological knowledge to include secondary sexual
characteristic changes during puberty such as the development of breasts or hips, the timing of
ovulation and links between menstrual cycle and reproduction. Others included knowledge of
menstrual disorders e.g., the definition of dysmenorrhea, causes of pain or discomfort, and included
questions about self-care for pain during menses.[18, 20] Four studies reported including questions
about hygiene practices during menstruation as part of knowledge assessments such as the types of
materials to use as absorbents, the frequency with which one should change materials.[20, 24, 44,
46].
In their list of examples, Blake 2018[15] included “Girls should stay home from school when
they are menstruating” as part of their knowledge test as a reflection of the content of the puberty
book provided as part of the intervention. A second study[46] also stated including questions about
avoiding foods or physical activity practices to be undertaken during menses in knowledge
assessments. These questions were similar to those used to capture menstrual restrictions in other
studies.

Review B
We did not identify any eligible studies developing measures of menstrual knowledge. One
broad measure of reproductive self-care included a subscale on knowledge and attitudes towards
open discussion of sexual and reproductive health topics.[51] In this sub-scale, some items

21

concerned freedom to discuss menstrual and reproductive health topics with parents, although
many items were more focused on sexual knowledge such as sexually transmitted diseases.

Intervention acceptability and product preferences
Review A
In our iterative groupings, eight studies included measures aiming to capture the
acceptability of the tested interventions. In three studies comparing different menstrual products,
satisfaction, comfort and product preferences or willingness to continue use were primary
outcomes.[14, 26, 45] Mohamed and colleagues 2014,[26] also compared physiological responses to
wearing sanitary pads of different thicknesses to further assess product performance. Shrestha 2018
[44] compared product demand in response to awareness raising and discounts, using coupon
redemption for products as an objective measure of demand. Two other pilot trials sought to
understand the acceptability of interventions to their target recipients using qualitative feedback
and self-report.[48, 50] One nested study compared ratings of product reliability, comfort and
satisfaction between participants given a reusable sanitary pad as part of the trial to those using
their existing materials, and assessed participant willingness to continue use of the provided
pad.[30] Questions used across studies varied specific to research questions or intervention.

Review B
No included studies developed measures of menstrual product or intervention acceptability.

Menstrual attitudes, beliefs, norms and restrictions
Review A
Five trials assessed intervention impacts on menstrual attitudes, and one additional trial
reported assessing ‘menarche experience’ comparing self-reported attitudes at menarche. Two
studies used the MAQ [55] and AMAQ [65, 66]. Three studies used self-created attitudes
questionnaires. Blake et al. [15] described a combined knowledge and attitudes questionnaire,
although it was unclear what attitude questions were included and no examples were provided.
Additionally, the study included two items capturing fear and shame in association with
menstruating, with the items reported in full: “Does the idea of menstruating make you feel afraid or
shameful?” and “Is talking about menstruation something that is shameful for you?”. Similar items
were described as psychosocial well-being outcomes in another program of work.[27, 29] Fetohy
[20] provided little description of the menstrual attitude scale used, noting only that it assessed
“attitude toward healthy and unhealthy practices during menstruation”. Afsari and colleagues [47]
developed a 15-question attitude scale which included items regarding menstruation, nutrition,
exercise, physical activity and psychological and mental health, but no further detail was provided.
Djalalinia [17] reported comparing whether participants reported feeling good (happy or proud, and
thankful) at the moment of menarche in methods, and in results presented if participants felt
confused, scared, uncomfortable, or good.
One study assessed the impact of a menstrual intervention on beliefs regarding
menstruation and sexual behaviour. In the study, this was separated from menstrual knowledge and
included ten items capturing: whether girls should continue education after menarche,
marriageability at menarche, and if there was a relationship between eating sweets and menstrual
bleeding. A second study [44] assessed stigma and norms about menstruation, although it did not

22

feature in the main text reporting of results. Stigma questions were described and asked women to
report whether they were allowed in the kitchen, holy places, secluded to a shed or considered
untouchable during menstruation; these were more similar to items capturing restrictions in another
study. As noted in the section on menstrual and hygiene practices, some studies included avoiding
physical activity, education or other activities during menstruation as practices. One nested study
[30] compared the impact of menstrual materials used by participants on whether they avoided daily
activities such as cooking, or doing sports during menstruation, and if there were activities
menstruation caused them to miss. These were compared according to the menstrual materials used
suggesting they reflected limitations due to material quality, but these also may reflect attitudes
towards appropriate behaviours during menstruation and did not fit easily into any iterative
groupings in the review.

Review B
Most Review B measure development studies sought to capture attitudes towards
menstruation (Table 4).
The Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire (MAQ). The MAQ was developed in 1980. The initial
questionnaire was tested among both male and female university students. Concurrently,
developers proposed a shorter, simplified version for adolescent individuals pre and post menarche.
As displayed in Table 3, the scale has five factors.
Attempts to revalidate the MAQ produced mixed results. Stubbs and colleagues (1988)
found poor internal consistency of subscales and proposed an alternate factor structure, capturing
‘affirmations’ of menstruation, and ‘worry’ or dislike of menstruation. Authors assess validation
through relationships with depression and anxiety symptoms, self-esteem, locus of control, and
body satisfaction. Over a decade later, Bramwell and colleagues (2002) found the MAQ factor
structure was not an acceptable fit in British or Indian samples. Similarly, a Turkish version of the
MAQ exhibited poor fit for the original factor structure. Authors undertook follow-up exploratory
analyses to propose an alternate factor structure broadly like the original MAQ, with some items
loaded differently. The original factor structure was not supported in a Greek version of the MAQ,
although similar to the Turkish version, follow-up EFA determined a similar five-factors with items
re-distributed.
With the hypothesis that the framing of menstruation in a positive rather than negative light
might cause respondents to view their menstrual experiences differently, two studies [52, 56] used a
parody Menstrual Joy Questionnaire (MJQ) (not eligible for this review due to a focus on symptoms)
to examine the effect of priming positive views of menstruation on responses to the MAQ, as well as
a questionnaire assessing the severity of menstrual symptoms not eligible for this review (the
Menstrual Distress Questionnaire, MDQ). Chrisler et al.[56] found exposure to the MJQ resulted in
more positive responses to menstruation on the MAQ, while in a second study Aubeeluck et al. [52]
found that the MAQ primarily increased scores on the ‘menstruation as a natural event’ subscale of
the MAQ.
The Adolescent Menstrual Attitude Questionnaire (AMAQ). In 1993, Morse and colleagues
developed an alternate attitude measure for adolescents with a form for premenarcheal and
postmenarcheal girls. Developed from the results of qualitative studies rather than the MAQ, the

23

AMAQ covers a different range of topics (see Table 4). Authors sought to identify differences
between girls before and after menarche and develop a meaningful measure for both groups.
Stereotypic Beliefs about Menstruation Scale (SBAM). This measure was reported only in a
conference abstract and focused on the assessment of negative stereotypical beliefs about
menstruation.[61] Authors compared subscale scores between men and women (see Table 4).
Beliefs about and attitudes towards menstruation questionnaire (BATM). Marvan and
colleagues [64] developed the BATM to capture Mexican adults’ attitudes towards menstruation
(Table 4). The measure was tested among Mexican and North American populations. Authors noted
differences between samples with the Mexican sample reporting higher expectations for avoiding
swimming, carrying heavy items and avoiding certain foods. Men also endorsed higher proscriptive
attitudes than women.
Menstrual self-evaluation scale. This measure was developed in 2004 and uses two subscales from the MAQ (‘bothersome’ and ‘menstruation as a natural event’) in addition to six new
items.[68] Self-evaluation scale scores were associated with self-objectification and objectified body
consciousness, consistent with author hypotheses as predictive validity.

Menstrual characteristics
Review A
One trial (Abedian) measured menstrual pain and blood loss using a variety of measures
beyond the scope of this review to compare between intervention education conditions and
controls. Four other trials used a variety of menstrual characteristics to provide a picture of the
sample.[16, 17, 34, 50] All described the proportion of the population experiencing menstrual pain
or dysmenorrhea. This was self-reported, although no studies described the questions used. Three
studies also reported the duration of menses, either in the average number of days [34, 50] or the
proportion of the sample experiencing ‘longer periods’ defined as more than 5 days of bleeding.[16]
Age at menarche was reported by Phillips-Howard et al.[34], and used in one nested study to
compare menstrual cup uptake according to the time since menarche.[38]

Review B
Five measure development studies focused on the accuracy of self-reported menstrual
characteristics. These studies evaluated the timing and modality of surveys and their impact on
recall accuracy. Two studies examined women’s self-reported cycle length, comparing respondents
cycle recorded in daily diaries to self-reported average cycle length.[62, 70] Jukic [62] reported that
diary recorded cycle length over 6 months showed moderate agreement with self-reported cycle
length (kappa=0.45) and reported that women overestimated their cycle length by an average 0.7
days. In this study, almost 35% of women reported having a 28-day cycle, but the diary observed
cycles suggested a less peaked distribution with between 15 and 20% of women recording cycles 2628 days. In contrast, Small [70] found a similar near 40% of women reporting a 28-day cycle, while
diary data suggested a less peaked distribution. In this study women underestimated their cycle
length by 1.5 days.
Weller [73] assessed women’s concepts of menstrual regularity and irregularity, comparing
self-reported irregularity to diary records of menses. Authors coded irregularity as those with one
third of cycles over a six-month period as more than 35 days or less than 21. Approximately 70%

24

were classified as regular in both methods. However, only 44% who reported irregularity were coded
as irregular using diary data, while some of the women who considered their periods to be regular
were coded to have irregular periods (18%).
Wegienka [72] found that 56% of women accurately reported the date of their last
menstrual period and that 81% reported it accurately within +/- two days. Authors also noted that a
duration of 3 weeks or longer since the last period was associated with overestimation of the time
since the last period. In their US sample, education level was not associated with recall accuracy.
Cooper [57] found that 85% of women at age 48 accurately recalled their age at menarche (reported
when 14-15 years old) within 1 year.

Education outcomes
Multiple trials assessed the impact of MH interventions on education. School attendance
measured through a combination of school registers,[27, 29, 40] spot checks,[29, 40] diaries [32, 34]
and self-report surveys [48] was the main education outcome measured in all studies assessing this
concept. Phillips-Howard et al.[34] also assessed school drop out as a primary outcome. Attendance
across all days was used in both Montgomery 2012 and 2016,[27, 29] while Oster 2011 used a
combination of attendance registers, absenteeism diaries and menstrual records to assess absences
during menstruation.[32] Phillips-Howard et al.[34] found that diaries were unreliable and were
unable to compare conditions on attendance using this method and so did not report findings in the
primary trial report. In 2019, Benshaul-Tolonen and colleagues used the school register and spotcheck data collected as part of that trial to compare intervention effects.[40] This study also used
additional register and spot-check data on non-trial students and boys in the trial schools to
compare attendance as recorded by these different methods, finding non-random inconsistencies
between spot-checks and attendance records. Wilson et al.[48] reported descriptively the days
missed due to menstruation but compared conditions based on the total number of days girls selfreported missing in the preceding month.
Educational engagement was inferred in a pilot trial and one nested study.[27, 31] In
surveys, girls self-reported if they were able to concentrate in school during their period. Identified
through Review B, Haver and colleagues described efforts to develop a measure including menstrual
related self-efficacy, stress and school participation.[60] They did not report tests of a final measure,
discussing difficulties in initial piloting and validation. Authors noted that items used to measure the
three pre-defined latent constructs overlapped in girls’ experiences.

Psychosocial and well-being outcomes
Review A
Two trials compared scores on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [76] as secondary
psychosocial well-being outcome,[27, 29] and this score was also included in study nested in the
second trial.[31] In addition, these trials included items asking girls to report on shame and
insecurity during menstruation compared to when they were not menstruating. These items are
similar to those assessed by Blake et al.[15] which assessed girls fear and shame associated with
menstruation. Leventhal et al.[21] included a range of psychosocial measures as outcomes, although
linked these to the resiliency components of the intervention rather than any attention to
menstruation.[22] These measures included emotional resiliency, general self-efficacy, socialemotional assets, depression, general anxiety, positive psychological well-being and social well-

25

being; all using previously developed and established measures.[23] Phillips-Howard et al.[34]
reported assessing wellbeing through the Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PEDSQL; [77]) and
used scores to describe balance across trial conditions at baseline. Well-being was not compared as
an outcome in trial reports, although was listed among secondary outcomes in trial registration.

Review B
The inclusion criteria for this review were designed to target menstrual-specific measures.
Generalised measures of psychosocial functioning and well-being are beyond the scope of this
review. One included measure study described the development of a measure of menstrual-related
psychosocial outcomes including sub-scales on stress and self-efficacy, but noted that these
concepts overlapped in the piloted items and did not report a final measure.[60]

Physical health or discomfort
Two trials comparing menstrual products assessed discomfort. Beksinska et al.[14] asked
participants to report comfort levels and adverse events associated with the sanitary pads and
menstrual cups, including vaginal irritation and dysuria. Stalder et al.[45] asked participants to report
on discomfort attributes including; feeling hot/sweaty/stuffy, itching, chafing, soreness/tenderness,
redness or presence of a rash, wet or sticking feeling, or burning. The Phillips-Howard trial [34]
compared the impact of sanitary pad and menstrual cup provision on sexually transmitted diseases,
C. trachomatis, T. vaginalis, and N. gonorrhoea, and reproductive tract infections bacterial vaginosis
or C. albicans using vaginal self-swabs. They also tested for adverse events, including the presence of
Staphylococcus aureus. A study nested within this trial further explored potential for adverse events
by testing the presence of S. aureus vaginal colonization and Escherichia coli grown on samples of
menstrual cups provided to girls.[37] These were compared according to the duration of cup use.
One nested study investigated the association of menstrual hygiene practices reported by
participants in the trial with self-reported reproductive tract infection symptoms which included:
skin irritation or rashes in the pelvic area, itching or burning in the pelvic area, and white or green
vaginal discharge since the start of the school year.[31]
Reproductive tract infection and biomarker methods were beyond the scope of our Review
B inclusion criteria focused on menstrual experience.

WASH
In five studies, investigators assessed Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) conditions.
WASH conditions were assessed to describe the comparability of infrastructure between eligible
schools and intervention conditions. In one trial, self-reported WASH infrastructure at home was
used to screen for eligible participants (those with a municipal water supply). In one nested study,
investigators assessed if there were any changes in WASH conditions throughout the duration of the
study; infrastructure to support menstruation did not improve, although there was increased soap
availability.[39]

Menstrual health
Review A
One study used a combined measure of ‘menstrual health’ as the primary outcome.[19] This
included items on a range of different features of menstrual experiences, including menstrual

26

practices, impacts of menstruation on daily activities and school attention, dietary choices, iron
supplementation and exercise.

Review B
Two included measure studies also concerned broad conceptualisation of menstrual health.
Menstrual Health Instrument. Developed in a South Korean context,[69] the construct was
informed by literature review and authors priorities to include both symptoms experienced during
the menstrual cycle as well as self-care, attitudes and perceptions about menstruation. Authors
validated the measure against self-reported menstrual cycle symptoms and quality of life measures.
Menstrual health seeking behaviours questionnaire. Developed in Iran among adolescent
girls,[58] items were based on the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and included all TPB model
components from perceived control and attitudes through to intentions and behaviours. Items were
drawn from review, qualitative studies and theoretical constructs.

27

Discussion
Through two linked systematic reviews we audited the measures used across trials and
nested studies of menstrual health and hygiene interventions in LMICs, and measures developed
across all countries to assess females’ experiences of menstruation. The key finding from our audit is
one of inconsistency across studies, supporting calls for greater attention to measurement.[3, 7, 78]
Results indicate that to improve measurement in menstrual health and hygiene research,
researchers must attend to the definition of core concepts, followed by the way these are
operationalised.

Concept definitions
By iteratively grouping measures we found that many studies assessed similar concepts, but
that these were defined differently in every study or lacked clear definitions entirely. As a result,
measures also differed, hampering comparisons across the evidence base. Particularly problematic
concepts were menstrual and hygiene practices, menstrual knowledge, and menstrual attitudes,
norms, beliefs and restrictions.

Menstrual and hygiene practices
To improve future research our review findings suggest that: (1) if interventions continue to
aim to improve ‘menstrual hygiene’ or ‘hygiene behaviours’, these concepts need to be consistently
defined and operationalised for measurement, and (2) researchers should identify a core set of
menstrual or hygiene practices needed to describe populations across studies.
Our audit suggests that greater attention to conceptual and definitional consistency will be
key to improving quantitative research in menstrual health and hygiene. Many trials and nested
studies included measures of the different practices or behaviours that participants undertook to
care for their bodies during menstruation. Forty-four different menstrual or hygiene practices were
reported, with no two studies assessing the same set of practices. Few studies acknowledged this
lack of consistency with other research and often used unified terms such as ‘menstrual hygiene’,
‘hygiene behaviours’ or ‘menstrual practices’ to label the construct measured. Recent measure
development efforts seeking to assess menstrual hygiene were also inconsistent in identifying the
boundaries of this construct and highlighted challenges in operationalising current definitions for
measurement. Menstrual hygiene and similar concepts were frequently used as trial outcomes, or to
describe study populations. Inconsistency across outcome measures means that intervention effects
on menstrual hygiene, or other iterations of this term, are not comparable across trials.
Inconsistency in describing population self-care practices makes it difficult to consider the
generalisability of study findings. Intervention effects may not generalise to populations with
different practice profiles and external validity will be difficult to appraise without consistent
descriptions across studies.
While challenging to institute in practice, the present study suggests that identification of a
core set of practices for assessment is likely of considerable value. Our audit reveals that practices
measured across studies have been highly inconsistent and seemingly haphazard. That is not to say
that the broad scope is a problem in-and-of-itself: some questions are relevant only for specific
research questions or cultural contexts, and there can be much to be learned by examining a wide

28

range of practices. However, until a core set of measures start to be regularly included in studies of
this topic, comparability across studies and across cultural contexts will be necessarily limited.

Menstrual knowledge
Similarly, this audit suggests that measures of knowledge are likely to be limited and
inconsistent without improved clarity in concept definitions. Menstrual knowledge was the primary
outcome of interest in many trials of menstrual education interventions. The coverage of topics in
knowledge tests varied significantly across studies, despite most studies focusing on adolescent girls.
This reflected the aims and content of the different education interventions, with researchers
defining menstrual knowledge gains based on the retention of information they provided in their
programs. The variation in knowledge assessed makes it difficult to compare results across studies.
Improved knowledge regarding the basic biology of menstruation (origin of bleeding, anatomy of the
female reproductive system, and age of menarche) may require a different intensity, duration or
format of education package than what may be needed to improve knowledge about sexual health,
menstrual disorders, reproductive tract infection symptoms or menstrual hygiene behaviours. This is
important when comparing intervention effectiveness, and in considering the impacts of education
interventions on more distal outcomes, such as health and education.
In undertaking needs assessments and evaluating the generalisability of trial results to other
populations, the results of this audit suggest it may be helpful to establish different components of
menstrual knowledge and their relation to the needs and experiences of women and girls.
Knowledge on different topics may show different relationships with well-being and education
outcomes; similarly different knowledge may be more beneficial at different life stages.[79] For
example, information on anatomy may dispel fears of illness or distress when received before
menarche, while more education on menstrual and pain management strategies may facilitate
school engagement among those post-menarche. This comes together to suggest it may be useful to
define a set of core menstrual knowledge items to be able to separate these results from other
hygiene or sexual health knowledge indicators and aid comparison across future studies.

Attitudes, norms, beliefs and restrictions
Attitudes, norms, beliefs, and restrictions featured prominently among the questions asked
in the studies we examined; however, as with many other topic areas, the ability of findings to speak
to each other across the field - and to be consistent with studies in other related fields - will continue
to be limited until terms are defined and deployed with more consistency. Our findings show that
authors across studies used terms such as menstrual stigma, norms, restrictions, and behavioural
proscriptions in varied ways, suggesting a lack of clarity around these concepts. These terminologies
were used across studies with overlapping meanings and measures, and with limited reference to
overarching theories such as social norm theory (e.g., [80, 81]) or mid-level theory of menstrual
experience.[2] Across measure development studies this manifested in the absence of a clear
nomological network. This meant few studies were able to validate scales against theoretically
related constructs and assess convergent, divergent or predictive validity.

Impact measures
Continued efforts to identify and use standardised measures when testing the impact of
menstrual health and hygiene interventions on non-menstrual outcomes are needed. Interventions
have been hypothesised to be relevant for health, education, psychosocial well-being, gender and

29

water, sanitation and hygiene domains.[78] Standardised measures for these outcomes were
beyond the scope of this review, but were addressed in an interdisciplinary meeting to set priority
impact measures for monitoring menstrual health and hygiene improvements.[78] This meeting
recommended a range of potential impact measures, few of which were used in past trials identified
by this review.
There continues to be a need for attention to measures of school attendance within the
field. Effects on education were most commonly tested by trials in this review, with studies focused
almost exclusively on attendance. Different measures including spot-checks, diaries, self-report and
school attendance records were used to capture attendance. While methods are likely to suffer from
different levels of bias in different contexts,[40] users of education-focused outcome variables
should be also be mindful of whether effect sizes reported are for outcomes specifically during
menstrual periods or general absenteeism. Absences due to menstruation occur only during that
phase of the menstrual cycle, reflecting a proportion of the total school days in a month. Measures
of general attendance may be easier to obtain and avoid the difficulties of recording menstrual
cycles, however, effect sizes will be diluted by non-menstrual days recorded.

Operationalising measures
Findings from our review and audit provide considerations for improving the
operationalisation of core concepts into valid and reliable measures in the study of menstrual health
and hygiene.
To improve measurement across research, all studies should clearly report the questions
used. Full disclosure of questionnaires through online supplementary materials and alongside trial
registrations would significantly improve readers’ and reviewers’ ability to compare findings across
studies. This would also facilitate transparency and allow critical appraisal of the questions used. Our
audit was consistently limited by the unavailability of measures and limited reflection by study
authors on the way core concepts were operationalised into questions.
This audit reveals that there is far more opportunity for questionnaire validation within the
field. Few measures used in trials had been formally validated, and only one developed measure (the
MAQ [55]) had been tested beyond its original context, and performed poorly across contexts.[54,
59] Further, development and validation of measures of menstrual attitudes have also suggested
significant variation in attitudes by culture,[54, 64] and age,[65] meaning care and cross-validation
will be needed in any attempt to develop questionnaires on this domain. These findings reinforce
the need for more attention and funding to the development and revalidation of measures of core
concepts to advance menstrual health and hygiene research.
Similarly, the field would benefit from more attention to measure reliability, particularly
since the relatively few studies focused on reliability analysis revealed some important findings. Few
studies provided information on the reliability of self-reported questions. Among trial studies, two
found poor agreement between self-reported menstrual practices and observational data or
qualitative study findings.[38, 50] While observations are invasive and may not be feasible for many
menstrual behaviours, comparison of self-report in surveys to diary entries or test-retest reliability
assessments may help to assess the accuracy of current survey data and refine question formats and
enumerator training. Self-reported menstrual characteristics such as the timing of menarche and the
last menstrual period were found to be reliable in studies in high income countries. Less reliable

30

were women’s reports of their cycle regularity compared to author definitions, although error in
self-reported cycle lengths was less than two days. These findings provide some confidence in the
potential of self-report questions, but more research in LMIC contexts is needed.
In considering the reliability of self-reported menstrual experience, evidence from high
income contexts suggests that priming and question order effects may need to be considered. Two
studies found that priming positive menstrual expectations impacted on participants self-reported
menstrual attitudes.[52, 56] This may be relevant to self-reports in intervention studies, where it is
unclear how priming or questions frames focused on negative experiences of menstruation, may
influence self-reported outcomes. It may be useful for developed measures to attend to balance in
positively and negatively framed questions.

Strengths and limitations of the review
Through systematic searching we provide a comprehensive picture of measures used in trials
of menstrual health and hygiene interventions and measures developed to capture menstrual
experiences. Our focus on trials rather than other quantitative study designs may have excluded
some measures. Based on reviews of past literature,[2, 5, 6] we determined that an in-depth analysis
of trials and nested studies offered a more manageable set of higher quality designs in which to
explore the measures used. Further, intervention trials are likely to be the highest priority for policy
makers and practitioners seeking evidence to inform programming. Our searching strategy for
Review B of measure studies focused on development and validation studies and may have missed
studies where measures were used and appraised as part of a study with a research question not
focused on measure reliability or validity.
Iterative category groupings were based on available studies and may have been
constructed differently by an alternative author group. Groupings reflect the current set of studies
and would likely change given a more nuanced set of included measures; for instance, improved
clarity in distinguishing attitudes towards menstruation from stigma or norms around menstruation
would result in more distinct groupings for these measures. In a deviation from the protocol, we did
not undertake formal quality appraisal of measurement validation studies. Through auditing
measured used, we found that conceptual ambiguity was the most significant concern. Positing that
the quality of measures is only meaningful where they capture relevant concepts, we dedicated our
attention to concept analysis.
We excluded studies which developed measures to identify menstrual disorders or
symptoms. This best aligned with our focus on improved measures in the study of menstrual health
and hygiene interventions in LMICs. These inclusion criteria meant we excluded the menstrual
distress questionnaire (MDQ).[82] The MDQ has been used in association with the development of
other menstrual experience measures such as the MAQ but focuses on physical symptoms
associated with the menstrual cycle.

Conclusions
Through this systematic review and audit, we provide a reference point capturing the
current measures used in menstrual health and hygiene research. We found that measures were
inconsistent in conceptualisation and operationalisation across studies. Findings suggest that
interdisciplinary efforts are needed to better define core constructs such as menstrual and hygiene

31

practices, menstrual knowledge, attitudes, norms and restrictions. In absence of consensus among
researchers, authors should clearly define the concepts measured for the purposes of their study.
Research is needed to develop and test reliable and valid measures for core concepts. To support
measure development, more attention to the appropriate application of existing theory, and theory
of menstrual experiences or intervention effects is needed to inform validity tests.
