Abstract
The dominant approach to combating the illegal wildlife trade has traditionally been to restrict
the supply of wildlife products. Yet conservationists increasingly recognise the importance of
implementing demand-side interventions that target the end consumers in the trade chain.
Their aim is to curb the consumption of wildlife or shift consumption to more sustainable
alternatives. However, there are still considerable knowledge gaps in our understanding of the
diversity of consumer motivations in the context of illegal wildlife trade, which includes
hundreds of thousands of species, different uses, and diverse contexts. We developed a
typology of common motivations held by wildlife consumers that can be used to inform
conservation interventions, based upon consultation with multiple experts from a diversity of
backgrounds, nationalities, and focal taxa. We identified five main motivational categories for
wildlife use: experiential, social, functional, financial, and spiritual, each containing subcategories. This framework is intended to facilitate more nuanced approaches to demand
reduction, such as the tailoring of interventions—whether behaviour change campaigns,
enforcement efforts, or incentive programmes—to the specific context in which they will be
used. It is an important step towards producing a more systematic approach to designing
demand reduction interventions that are more likely to succeed.

Introduction
Wild species have a long history of being traded and used by humans, but there is increasing
conservation concern about over-exploitation to supply commercial trade in these animals and
plants (Hughes, 2003; Challender and MacMillan, 2014). While many trade chains are
sustainable and provide a range of benefits for local communities (e.g., Golden et al., 2014),
illegal and/or unsustainable trade in wildlife threatens the future of many species (MilnerGulland et al., 2003; Rosen and Smith, 2010). The illegal wildlife trade is estimated to be one
of the largest and most lucrative international crimes, and has impacts that extend beyond
harming those species directly traded, including undermining local livelihoods and damaging
the broader stability of ecosystems (Rosen and Smith, 2010; Cardinale et al., 2012; Sas-rolfes
et al., 2019). Curtailing this trade is both a major conservation priority (Rosen and Smith, 2010;
Challender, Harrop and MacMillan, 2015), and an increasingly high-profile global issue, as
recognised by the United Nations in 2015, 2016, and 2017 (General Assembly resolution
69/314, 70/301, 71/326).

The dominant approach to combating the illegal wildlife trade has traditionally been to restrict
the supply of wildlife products, through interventions such as trade bans, improved customs
checks and anti-poaching measures, (Phelps, Carrasco, & Webb, 2014). More recently,
conservationists are increasingly recognising the importance of demand-side interventions
aimed at the end consumers in the trade chain (Verissimo and Wan, 2018). This new focus
was highlighted in Decisions 17.44 to 17.48 at the Convention on International Trade in
Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) 17th Conference of the Parties, which
emphasised the need for increasing demand reduction efforts (CITES Secretariat, 2016). This
trend is driving an increased focus on shifting individual behaviour through approaches such
as social marketing and environmental education programs aimed at curbing the consumption
of wildlife or shifting consumption to more sustainable choices (Verissimo and Wan, 2018;
Veríssimo et al., 2018).

Interventions to shift unsustainable wildlife demand should use research from behavioural
science fields like sociology, marketing, and psychology (Veríssimo, Challender, & Nijman,
2012). This is because we need to better understand the drivers of consumption, and the
internal or external barriers that inhibit consumers from shifting towards a desired behaviour
(e.g., using a sustainable product). Knowledge of these factors enables conservationists to
more effectively influence consumption patterns. A variety of behavioural models, including
the theory of planned behaviour or the model of goal directed behaviour, can serve to enhance
our understanding of the behaviour change process (Davis et al, 2015; Ajzen, 1985; Perugini
and Bagozzi, 2001). Previous research has shown that interventions using behaviour change
models to inform their design stage are more effective than those which do not leverage these
models (Michie and Prestwich, 2010; Atkin and Rice, 2012).

One behaviour change model that has been widely used is the COM-B model Michie, Stralen
and West (2011). This model posits that there are three essential components for behaviour
change to occur: the capability (the physical and psychological ability to change), the
opportunity (a physical and social environment that is conducive to change), and the
motivation (positive personal beliefs and desires towards change) (Fig. 1). This paper focuses
on addressing key knowledge gaps around the third component, consumer motivation. We
define consumer motivation as the drive to satisfy unmet needs and wants, whether
physiological and/or psychological, through the acquisition of products (Pincus, 2004).
Understanding the underlying motivations driving the uses of specific products, along with the
societal and cultural context in which they are consumed, allows for more effective behaviour
change interventions (Rothschild, 1999; Michie, Stralen and West, 2011; Burgess, 2016;
Taylor et al., 2009).

Figure 1. The COM-B system - a framework for understanding behaviour. (Michie, Stralen
and West, 2011)

The wildlife trade encompasses a diverse range of wildlife products used for a variety of
purposes. Uses range from rhino horn being consumed by Vietnamese businessmen as a
signal of their social status or a remedy for hangovers (Truong et al., 2015), to bushmeat
consumption in Gabon driven by the need for a healthy diet (Milner-Gulland et al., 2003), to
illegally imported orchids used for ornamentation in China (Williams et al., 2018). Approaches
to reduce demand need to take into account this diversity of motivations and uses, yet
currently there is no applicable taxonomy for motivations in the context of the wildlife trade.

This paper provides a typology of common motivations held by end consumers in the trade
chain that can be used to inform conservation interventions. It is intended to facilitate more
nuanced approaches to behaviour change, such as the tailoring of interventions—whether
behaviour change campaigns, enforcement efforts or incentive programmes—to the specific
context in which they will be used. We also wish to highlight the diversity of demand for wildlife
products which necessitates a diversity in demand reduction approaches. Finally we provide

an outline for future research that may help to guide interventions efforts, for example, to
compare whether different motivations are impacted differently by different types of
interventions.

Developing a framework for motivations in IWT
Despite previous research on consumers in the wildlife trade (Drury, 2011; Hinsley, Veríssimo
and Roberts, 2015; Shairp et al., 2016; Theng, Glikman and Milner-Gulland, 2017), consumer
motivations, especially in relation to specific products, are routinely overlooked or, at best,
only given a cursory mention. A typology of consumer roles described in Phelps et al. (2016)
outlined the different uses for wildlife products, and provides insights into the key actors in
wildlife market chains. This focus on “types of use” differs from “motivations for use” though,
as people can use the same product in a similar way (e.g., eating, building), yet have very
different motivations behind that usage. For example, pangolin meat may be consumed for
basic subsistence needs in Ghana, but it is predominantly used to display social status in
Vietnam (Boakye et al., 2016; Shairp et al., 2016). Although the behaviours are superficially
the same (consumption of pangolin meat), due to the differing motivations the two sets of
consumers are highly unlikely to respond to the same intervention strategy.

Only a few studies have specifically looked at motivations. As part of acknowledging the
complexity of demand, Ayling (2015) called for a more systematic approach to addressing
wildlife consumers and highlighted examples of demand, such as demand simply for personal
pleasure. This piece was followed by an initial framework of motivations, which identified a set
of ten motivational clusters that influence wildlife product use around the world (Burgess,
2016). This approach was developed further by Thomas-Walters (2017), in which clusters,
such as “functional”, became umbrella headings for other, more specific, motivations, such as
“medicinal” and “nutritional”.

For our work we then drew upon these umbrella clusters to develop a comprehensive
framework of motivations. We wished to fill gaps, including the omission of categories such as
the use of wildlife products for fuel, and ensure that the framework could be applied globally.
This process involved iterative rounds of feedback from multiple experts from a diversity of
backgrounds, nationalities, and focal species. Feedback came from both academia, practice,
and the private sector, as well as those working in a range of key consumer countries,
including China, the UK, and the USA. Experts had expertise in a wide range of taxonomic
groups, from orchids to pangolins, tropical timbers to elephants. We then held a workshop at
the IWT Evidence to Action 2018 symposium with approximately 30 participants. The
workshop involved a structured roundtable discussion with multiple rounds of comments,
followed by a final round of adjustment to reach a qualitative consensus on the framework.
Ethics approval was granted by the University of Kent School Research Ethics Advisory
Group, reference 10-PGR-18/19.

Wildlife consumers motivation framework
We identified five main motivational categories for wildlife use: experiential, social, functional,
financial, and spiritual, each containing sub-categories (Fig. 2). For this work, we have
focussed on motivations that drive demand for specific products, but acknowledge that there
are a multitude of contextual and enabling factors that could also affect usage such as habits,
availability, and price. For instance, someone may desire tiger bones for a traditional remedy
but be unable to purchase any, so they opt to buy lion bone instead. In this case, availability
has affected the consumer’s decisions, but the underlying motivational driver is still medicinal.
Similarly, a large number of people in both Vietnam and China value ivory for its ornamental
qualities, but use is much lower in Vietnam because potential consumers currently lack the
financial means to purchase it (National Geographic and GlobeScan, 2015). A detailed
description of the behaviours driven by the different motivations is laid out in Table 1.

Motivated by the desire to practice rituals or

When applying this framework there are three key aspects that need to be considered. First,
our framework is a multivariate rather than discriminate typology. Although the motivational
categories are discrete, products may well be used for multiple reasons and thus
conservationists should not use this framework to pigeonhole consumers, who may be driven
by multiple motivations. For example, one of the largest threats to songbirds (Passeriform
spp.) in Southeast Asia is the capture of wild birds to be kept as pets (Souto et al., 2017),
particularly in Indonesia (Bergin et al., 2018; Burivalova et al., 2017). These birds are highly
valued for their beauty and singing ability (Regueira and Bernard, 2012). They are entered
into songbird competitions, and winners receive both social status and monetary prizes
(Jepson, Ladle and Sujatnika, 2011). The ownership of a songbird is also considered a rite of
passage for young men in some parts of Indonesia (Anggraini, 2017). Each of these
motivations is distinct, but they may be simultaneously held by consumers (Fig. 3). Moreover,
while each of these motivations are distinct, some of them may be more pressing than others.
In such cases, choice experiments, or similar techniques for examining the trade-offs made
between attributes by individual consumers, can be used to illuminate the relative strength of
different motivations (Hinsley, Verissimo and Roberts, 2015; Shairp et al., 2016).

Figure 3. Motivations associated with the purchase of songbirds (Souto et al., 2017; Jepson,
Ladle and Sujatnika, 2011; Regueira and Bernard, 2012; Anggraini, 2017)

The second consideration is that although some motivational categories (e.g., financial gain)
may apply to multiple actors along the trade chain, our framework focuses on the end
consumers so care is needed to understand which groups are actually driving demand. For
example, seahorses (Hippocampus spp.) are used globally in traditional medicine (Fig. 4), with
the largest demand coming from China and Taiwan (Foster et al., 2019). Dried seahorses are
used as a remedy for a variety of medical conditions in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM),
including sexual dysfunction and difficult childbirth (Rosa and Defavari, 2013). If a Chinese

man visited a traditional medicine practitioner for an arthritis treatment and was prescribed
dried seahorses, then the demand for seahorses is not necessarily coming from the patient. If
he just wished to have a generic remedy and was happy to take whatever he was prescribed,
then the species-specific demand would actually be coming from the TCM practitioner. It may
therefore be more effective to target these intermediaries in the trade chain rather than the
consumer himself. This example of mediated demand is different from someone who
specifically requests seahorses because of a belief in their curative properties, which is where
our framework would be of use in consumer segmentation.

Figure 4. Motivations associated with the purchase of seahorses (Kumaravel et al., 2012;
Foster et al., 2019; Martin-Smith and Vincent, 2006)

The third consideration relates to the COM-B model, which recognises that motivation is only
one of the factors that enable behaviour change (Michie, Stralen and West, 2011). Thus, while
it is always important to understand motivations, in some cases it will be more effective to use
structural or legal interventions that target capability and opportunity (Rothschild, 1999). For
example, there is great demand by international consumers for orchids (Hinsley et al., 2017;
Williams et al., 2018), with people buying these plants as a hobby and out of an aesthetic
appreciation for their beauty (Fig. 5). In some cases, many of these plants are illegally supplied
from the wild and so conservationists might seek to tackle the problem through a demand
reduction intervention. However, research on consumers shows that for collectors in China,
colourfulness is a larger motivator than origin (Williams et al., 2018). Therefore a more costeffective conservation strategy may involve facilitating artificial propagation of more colourful
orchids, or to improve enforcement so as to increase the costs and barriers of importing wildsourced plants.

Figure 5. Selected motivations associated with the purchase of wild-sourced orchids (Liu et
al., 2014; Hinsley et al., 2017; Williams et al., 2018)

Framework applications
There are two key ways that our framework could contribute to the conservation of illegally
traded species. First, it allows the segmentation of target consumers by motivation. In social
marketing, for instance, segmentation is used because people with comparable attributes
generally respond similarly to different messaging strategies (Nisbet and Scheufele, 2009;
Graham and Abrahamse, 2017), allowing for more focussed and efficient interventions (as
opposed to a traditional “one size fits all” approach). Demand reduction interventions in
conservation rarely attempt this step (Greenfield and Veríssimo, 2018), but when they do they
frequently classify people by demographic variables such as age and gender. Segmentation
based only on demographics, however, largely neglects the psychographic profiling of
customers that can provide more useful information (Lin, 2002). The health sector has
recognised the value of psychographics (the study of personality, values, and motivations) for
connecting with target audiences (Boslaugh et al., 2005) and there are strong parallels with
the design of behaviour change interventions in conservation.

Such segmentation is also important to the design and enforcement of legal-regulatory
frameworks targeting consumers. For example, the effectiveness of enforcement measures is
also likely to differ across motivations, with the enforcement of rules that conflict with deeplyheld spiritual motivations potentially facing significant challenges. The willingness of officials
to enforce laws that contradict their own deep-rooted beliefs should also be taken into account
when designing interventions, as evidence suggests that imposing strict laws that conflict
strongly with prevailing social norms may backfire (Acemoglu and Jackson, 2017). These
broader examples underline the importance of identifying the main motivations amongst
consumers in each market as part of baseline research. However, it is important that such

work accounts for researcher/practitioner bias, especially when conservationists are from a
different culture to the target audience. Thus, it is key that conservationists undertaking
consumer research to understand the audience’s perspective and motivations collaborate with
local actors.

A second application for our framework is in the design of new research and novel
interventions. For instance, it could be adopted when evaluating the success of addressing
different motivations for consumption, and identifying the most influential motivators for
specific groups (Burgess, 2016; Thomas-Walters, 2017). Another as-yet unexplored avenue
for future research is the potential for shared messaging strategies, or whole interventions,
targeting products that are purchased by the same consumer group due to the same
motivations (Burgess, 2016). For example, if there is a key consumer group that desires both
ivory and rosewood for their aesthetic qualities and the prestige associated with owning them,
it could be that one intervention could successfully target both behaviours, or the same
strategy could be used consecutively on the same group to target each behaviour. The former
approach is supported by related research on behavioural spillovers, which has shown that
changing one behaviour can sometimes lead to alterations in other, similar behaviours
(Truelove et al., 2014). Harnessing shared motivations to address consumption of multiple
products within a single intervention would be of enormous value in conservation, where funds
and resources are often limited (Bottrill et al., 2008; McDonald-Madden, Baxter and
Possingham, 2008).

By mapping out motivations, conservation practitioners and researchers will elucidate the
complexity of both individual wildlife product usage, and the wildlife trade overall. This
underlines the importance of consumer research, which is lacking for most demand reduction
interventions (Greenfield and Veríssimo, 2018). Our analysis provides a broad, globallyapplicable framework that can underpin the development of a common language for wildlife
trade research, making it easier for practitioners and researchers to identify relevant previous

studies containing lessons that could inform potential future interventions. Thus, it is an
important step towards producing a more systematic approach to designing effective demand
reduction interventions.
