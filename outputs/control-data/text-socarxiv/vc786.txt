Abstract There is an ongoing debate between focalization and universalization on
welfare policies as the best way to develop the welfare state in Latin America and the
Caribbean. However, there is a need to develop a measure that exhibits the multidimensional nature of the welfare state, instead of focusing on the social spending dimension.
Segura-Ubiergo (The political economy of the welfare state in Latin America: globalization, democracy and development. Cambridge University Press, New York, 2007) constructed a welfare effort index (WEI) to facilitate understand the relative degrees of welfare
state development among Latin American countries. The WEI focuses mainly on social
spending and ignores the other dimensions of welfare. Based on a comparative analysis of
17 Latin American countries and following the methodology of Segura-Ubiergo, a new
index that aims at enriching the WEI was constructed. The new index is multidimensional
in that it has eight indicators relating to three dimensions of welfare: social spending,
coverage of welfare programs and outcome of welfare institutions. Principal component
analysis was used for reducing the indicators into three indexes that represent three proposed dimensions of welfare. The combination of these three indexes gives the multidimensional welfare index. The results of the index account for more than 75 % of the data
variance.

Lago (1994) marks the beginning of studies on analysis of social security systems;
Fernando Filgueira complemented Mesa-Lago’s approach using other types of variables, such as the following: the degree of social services coverage; levels of public
spending; degree of public benefits; and indicators showing the degree of social
development. Molina (2006) examined the possibility of a reform and transformation
of the Latin American welfare state, while Gough and Wood (2004) made a comparative analysis of the welfare state regimes of Latin American and other regions.
Barba (2006), influenced by Esping-Andersen (1990, 1996), identified three ideal
types of welfare regimes in the region; Martı́nez Franzoni and Voorend (2009) performed a typological construction of welfare regime scheme where empirical homogeneity is not required among countries in the same ideal welfare regime, instead, the
countries need common and relevant patterns that describe the welfare as the means
to assess capacity of collective risk management. Several researchers analyzed targeted welfare programs—known as conditional cash transfer programs (Barrientos
2011; Villatoro 2005; Rawlings and Rubio 2003; Sewall 2008). Huber et al. (2008)
assessed the determinants of social spending in the region. These and many other
aspects of the Latin American welfare state were examined in recent decades,
although little attention was devoted to analyze the degree of welfare state development. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the study of the welfare state
development by proposing a new index that measures the relative development of the
welfare state of Latin American and Caribbean countries, with a multidimensional
perspective. The pioneering study of Segura-Ubiergo (2007) is the main source for
assessing the level of welfare development in Latin America.
Segura-Ubiergo (2007) wonders how some Latin American countries could historically develop more extensive welfare states than did the other countries in the region?
His research examines how, in Latin American countries, a combination of some
economic and political factors contributed to the expansion of the welfare state to a
greater extent than in others. Based on a comparative analysis and by constructing an
index of welfare effort, the author identifies five countries1 in Latin America with a
relatively more developed welfare state, in comparison to that of other countries in the
region.
For the present analysis, to review and complement the results of Segura-Ubiergo
(2007), three more countries (Colombia, Panamá and Puerto Rico) will be added
to his list of fourteen.2 For constructing a multidimensional index that reflects the
relative development of the welfare states in the region with a more comprehensive perspective, eight (8) indicators relating to three welfare dimensions will be
considered.

2 Welfare State Development in a Developing Region
Welfare states from Latin American and the Caribbean are considered welfare states in
transition (Esping-Andersen 1996; Huber 1996), emerging welfare states (Huber and
Stephens 2012), or developmental welfare state in the making (Riesco 2009). Meaning that

Hopefully, in the near future Cuba, Honduras, Nicaragua, Guiana, Belize, Haiti, Jamaica and other
Caribbean islands may also be added to the analysis in order to have a complete study of the welfare states
of Latin America and the Caribbean.

their welfare institutions and programs aren’t yet developed as their counterparts in Europe
and other industrialized countries. In this article an index to measure the welfare state
development is proposed. This index pretend to reflects the level of development among
the emerging/developmental welfare state in the region. The term welfare state development refers to progress and institutionalization of welfare programs that address social
risks of the population in order to assure a common well-being. Following EspingAndersen (1990) it could be argued that the development of the welfare state refers to the
process of institutionalization of welfare programs, to ensure a basic minimum of entitled
social protection to the population.
Before analyzing the results of Segura-Ubiergo, presented in Table 1, it would be
important to present certain details that will enrich the analysis. The period used by the
author for study is the welfare state expansion and consolidation era in Latin America. ‘‘A
study of the origins of the welfare state, both in advanced capitalist democracies and in
Latin America, would require a careful analysis of the political and economic factors that
led to the passage of the first social security and welfare laws in the second and third
decades of the century (earlier for some countries). By contrast, an analysis of the
development of the welfare state would focus on the socioeconomic and political factors
that transformed initial social legislation into increasingly greater welfare entitlements,
public health systems and public education systems’’. The welfare state development and
consolidation period in Latin American (from 1940s to the present) could be divided into
two periods according to Segura-Ubiergo (2007): the pre-globalization period that covers
the period roughly from 1945 to 1979, and the globalization period that covers the period
from 1979 to the present. The splitting of the development of Latin America’s welfare state
into two periods was necessitated by the major policy transition of the 1980s (beginning of
globalization period), when the largest countries in the region started to gradually leave
behind Industrialization by Substitution of Imports (ISI) policies and started opening up to
the capital’s international market.
Segura-Ubiergo (2007) analysis (see Table 1) shows a clear division of Latin
American countries into two groups, based on the role and scope of state responsibility
towards social security. The first group consists of countries with a high welfare effort
and the second group with a relatively low welfare effort. The author uses principal
component analysis (PCA) and reduces the four welfare indicators into one index. Segura-Ubiergo’s welfare index accounts for about 91 % of the variation in the four
components or indicators analyzed, and hence it could be considered a good summaryindicator of the four subcomponents of welfare effort. However, the author (2007, p. 25)
comments that three of the four components of his welfare index are social spending
measures. Because of the over-riding importance given to social expenditure, his index is
subject to criticism.
To improve Segura-Ubiergo’s welfare index, four new indicators were added to the four
already present in his analysis. Following are the new indicators: (a) percentage of
employees with retirement coverage, (b) number of hospital beds per ten thousand
inhabitants, (c) percentage of population with high level of education, and, (d) the
improbability of suffering infant mortality (under 5 years of age). This index was constructed for the period known as the globalization era (1973–2010) and what Sottoli (2000)
calls the new social policy era (with the liberalization of economy and focalization of
social policy) that left behind the traditional, interventionist and universal (in theory) social
policy.

The social spending indicators are social spending as a percentage of GDP, social spending as a percentage of public spending, and social spending per capita. The coverage
indicator refers to the percentage of population covered by at least a social security program. The WEI pretends to measure the relative welfare effort among the 14 Latin
American countries. The table shows a clear division of Latin American countries into two groups, those with high welfare effort (WEI above the sample average) and those
with low welfare effort (WEI below the sample average)

3 Components of the New Welfare Index
To take into account different dimensions of welfare, eight indicators, representing three
welfare dimensions, were included in the new welfare index for analysis. Social spending
as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP), social spending as a percentage of
public spending and social spending per capita are the three indicators that represent the
spending dimension in the new welfare index. Percentage of population covered by at least
a social security program, percentage of employees with retirement coverage, and hospital
beds per ten thousand inhabitants are the three indicators that represent the extent of
welfare programs coverage in the new index. Finally, percentage of population with high
level of education, and the improbability of suffering infant mortality (under 5 years of
age) are the indicators that represent the outcome dimension in the new index. Data for the
8 indicators used in this article are provided in the ‘‘Appendix’’.
First, each of the three welfare dimensions will be reduced to individual indexes of
welfare. Then, each individual index will have the same weight in the construction of the
multidimensional welfare index. Before introducing the methodology and index construction, a more detailed explanation of the eight (8) indicators is presented below.
3.1 Spending Dimension
Three of the four components used by Segura-Ubiergo in his welfare index are included in
the spending dimension of the new multidimensional welfare index proposed here. The first
of these indicators is social spending as a percentage of the GDP. The value of this indicator
represents the importance of social spending as compared to the total monetary value of the
production of final goods and services in each country. Because there is no generalized
measure of social spending in the database that includes the countries analyzed in this study,
it is important to mention that social spending, as used in this study, relates to spending on
health, education and social security programs. In the case of Puerto Rico, Colombia and
Panama, the details of spending had to be calculated and the data required came from the
following sources: Alameda-Lozada and Diaz-Rodriguez (2009); CEPAL (1980, 1990, 1991,
2000, 2002, 2004); Junta de Planificacion (1984a, b, 1990, 2000, 2008); Mitchell (2003);
data for the remaining countries came from Segura-Ubiergo’s study (2007, 29).
The second indicator is social spending in terms of percentage of public spending. The
value of public spending represents the net value after deducting the payment of debt
interest. In the case of Puerto Rico, Colombia and Panama, these details had to be calculated, and the data required came from the following sources: CEPAL (1980, 1990,
1991, 2000, 2002, 2004); Junta de Planificacion (1984a, b, 1990, 2000, 2008); data for the
remaining countries came from Segura-Ubiergo’s study (2007, 30). This value helps
determining the priority that each State gives, through its government, for education, health
and social security.
The third indicator in this dimension is social spending per capita. Just as the first two
indicators, this is also an average of the values of the period 1973–2000. In the case of
Puerto Rico, Colombia and Panama, the values had to be calculated, and the data came
from Barriento (2012); CEPAL (1980, 1990, 1991, 2000, 2002, 2004); Junta de Planificacion (1984a, b, 1990, 2000, 2008); data for the remaining countries came from SeguraUbiergo’s study (2007, 30). This indicator is important for comparative studies of social
expenditure as a resource received by citizens in transfers from the state. These three
indicators will be reduced, through principal component analysis, to a social spending
dimension index (SSDI).

3.2 Coverage Dimension
The coverage dimension also consists of three (3) indicators. The first is the percentage of
population covered by social security around 1980. This is the fourth and last component
used in Segura-Ubiergos’s welfare index. Data for all countries included in this analysis,
with the exception of Puerto Rico, came from Table 2 in Mesa-Lago (1989); the values for
Puerto Rico had to be calculated from the data available in Colón Reyes (2011).3 This
indicator gives the population percentage covered by any social security program in the
respective country.
The second coverage indicator is the percentage of employees with retirement coverage
(% ERC). This refers to the average number of active employees entitled to receive
pension during the first decade of the century (2000–2010). The data for this was taken
from the Socioeconomic Database for Latin America and the Caribbean (SEDLAC),
except for Panama and Puerto Rico. The data for calculating % ERC of Puerto Rico came
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (Negociado de Estadisticas del Trabajo 2011, p.
Table 19),4 and that for Panama from the National Institute of Statistics and Census
(Instituto Nacional de Estadistica y Censo (INEC) 2004–2005, 2005–2006, 2006–2007,
2007–2008, 2008–2009).5
The third coverage indicator is the number of hospital beds for every ten thousand
inhabitants.6 The data for this came from the Socioeconomic Database for Latin America
and the Caribbean (SEDLAC), except for Puerto Rico which was taken from the Pan
American Health Organization (2012). The indicator represents the level of health sector
coverage in the welfare state. One might ask here ‘‘Why use this indicator instead of other
indicators of health coverage?’’. Any person who specializes in comparative analysis
knows that finding data and relevant variables for all the countries is almost impossible,
and particularly so in Latin America. Only two indicators, which reflect health coverage,
are available for the 17 cases of this study: the population per physician and hospital beds
per capita. To choose between these two indicators, one must identify the indicator that
demonstrates a more direct coverage of the welfare institutions in the respective country.
This explains why the number of hospital beds per ten thousand inhabitants was selected as
the health coverage indicator, and not doctors per capita.

To obtain the percentage of population
covered by a social security program in Puerto Rico, the following
P
ðSSBþELFþPPANORÞ
. The population covered by the social security (PCSS)
formula was applied: PCCS ¼
Population
would be obtained by dividing the sum of three components over the magnitude of the entire population.
Following are the three components on the numerator: (a) social security beneficiaries (SSB), (b) the
employed labour force (in the formal sector) (ELF) and, (c) the population that receives PAN funds as their
only revenue (PPANOR). PAN is the focalized food program in Puerto Rico for people below the poverty
line; it is also known as food stamps.
4

To obtain the percentage of employees with retirement coverage (% ERC), the following formula was
ELF
applied: % ERC ¼ ðELFþILFÞ
. In Puerto Rico, the employed labour force (in the formal sector) pay their taxes
(via monthly deductions) and therefore are included as an employed person entitled to old-age social
security benefits, which can be viewed as a retirement benefit. % ERC value was obtained by dividing the
employed labour force (in the formal sector) by the number of workers in both formal and informal sectors.
The informal sector workers value was calculated using the ‘‘Informal Labor Force’’ (ILF) from Pol and
Silvestrini (2004, p. 115).
5

The percentage of employees with retirement coverage in Panamá was obtained by dividing the data of
active contributors insured, among the total employed population.

6

It was determined to use, as denominator, population figures presented in thousands, because of its utility
for this research.

123

These three indicators will be reduced through PCA to a coverage dimension index
(CDI).
3.3 Outcomes Dimension of the Welfare Institutions
Finally, for this dimension of welfare, two indicators were considered. The first one is
the percentage of the population with at least 1 year of ‘‘higher’’ (post-secondary)
education. This indicator shows the proportion of adults, in the age group of
25–65 years, with more than 13 years of formal education.7 The data for all the countries, except Puerto Rico, came from the Socioeconomic Database for Latin America and
the Caribbean (SEDLAC), and that for Puerto Rico from the Puerto Rico Planning Board
Junta de Planificacion (2000a) and US Census Bureau (n.d.). The data is the average of
the results of this indicator during the first decade of the century (2000–2010). This
indicator not only reflects the success of educational institutions in retaining their students to complete primary and secondary education, but also indicates indirectly which
countries have been successful in this regard by creating various programs and
institutions.
The second outcome indicator is the improbability of children under 5 years suffering
infant mortality. Data for this came from the information and analysis of the health
project of Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) (Pan American Health Organization 2012). The data refers to the average of the indicators in the first decade of the
century (2000–2010). The source data had to be converted into negative form
(improbability of suffering infant mortality), so that when performing the principal
component analysis, the statistical program recognizes the higher value cases as the most
desirable ones, and not vice versa. So, the country with the lowest infant mortality rate,
has the highest score in this indicator, because it reflects the improbability of suffering
infant mortality. In other words, infant mortality should be lower in countries with more
developed welfare health institutions. This indicator thus reflects the success of healthcare institutions.
This raises the question, ‘‘Why not one uses the life expectancy at birth to measure
the performance of health institutions?’’ While life expectancy at birth is one of the
most used statistics to measure quality of life and human development, it was not
considered suitable for this study, because there are many factors that affect life
expectancy at birth that are unrelated to the level of welfare state development. Life
expectancy at birth is ‘‘the years that a newborn can expect to live if an age-specific
mortality pattern prevailing at the time of his birth remains throughout his life’’
(PNUD 2011). This indicator is not intended to measure the life expectancy of a
person at birth, but the probability of her or his survival beyond 5 years, because this
is a more direct measure of the development of health institutions and thus the success
of welfare institutions.
These two indicators will be reduced, through principal component analysis, to the
outcomes dimension index (ODI).

7

The other components of the educational structure of Latin American and Caribbean countries, namely
low degree of formal education (0–8 years) and medium level of education (9–12 years), can be observed in
the SEDLAC database.

4 Methodology
How does one calculate this new multidimensional welfare index? Before answering this
question, it would be helpful to elaborate on how to use the PCA for calculating the new
index.
4.1 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Principal component analysis (PCA) is a mathematical method developed by Pearson
(1901) from a geometric perspective, which was subsequently revised algebraically by
Hotelling (1933). It is now one of the most commonly used methods to reduce multidimensionality of a dataset (Schuschny and Soto 2009, p. 42). The goal of PCA is to
explain most of the total variability observed in a set of variables with the fewest possible
components (Uriel Jiménez 1995).
Wuensch (2004) notes that the intention of PCA is to extract a set of p variables to a set
of m components representing the largest possible variance in the p variables. It could also
be seen as the process of reducing a set of p variables to a set of m underlying dimensions
of higher order.
These underlying components were inferred from the correlations between the p variables. Each component was estimated as a weighted sum of the p variables. The ith
component is then given by the following:
PCi ¼ Wi1 X1 þ Wi2 X2 þ Wip Xp
To reduce the original variables to the fewest possible components, it will be necessary
that they correlate highly with each other; the higher the correlation with the original
variables, the fewer the number of resulting components when performing the PCA. To
measure the inter-correlation between the original variables, it is necessary to observe the
correlation matrix, as well as the determinant test of the correlation matrix. The outcome of
the test may determine the degree of correlation between the variables of original data and
whether it is advisable to continue with the PCA. If the test results show that the determinant is very low, then it means that inter-correlation among the variables is very high;
this in turn suggests that it is feasible to continue with the factor analysis. However, the
determinant must not be zero, because in such a case the data would not be valid (OECD
and European Commission 2008).
In addition, a series of calculations will be required before performing the PCA to check
the statistical relevance of PCA to the data. To measure statistical relevance, the Bartlett
test of sphericity was used. This test was used to test the null hypothesis that the variables
were not correlated amongst themselves. That is, it was a check to determine if the
correlation matrix was an identity matrix. According to the OECD and European Commission report, if the test results show a high value, whose reliability (p value) is \0.05,
then the results can be considered valid In this case, the null hypothesis was rejected and
the analysis continued (OECD and European Commission 2008, p. 67).
In a previous section of this paper, it was mentioned that the new multidimensional
welfare index would assign the same weight to each of the three welfare dimensions. Each
dimension will be a set of indicators, reduced by PCA. No doubt, the PCA could have been
applied directly to the eight indicators to obtain the new index. In fact, that was the idea at
the beginning of this study, but because such procedure does not satisfy the statistical rule
of ‘‘sufficient number of cases for variables’’, it became necessary to adopt another
approach to reduce the indicators to a multidimensional index. The new approach used the

123

1304

Human Development Index (HDI) methodology as the reference. The HDI includes three
indexes (Life Expectancy Index, Education Index and Income Index), which are reduced to
one composite indicator. The same procedure was followed here8; the three welfare
dimension indexes [Social Spending Dimension Index (SSDI), Coverage Dimension Index
(CDI) and Outcomes Dimension Index (ODI)] were proposed to be combined into one
composite indicator. That way, each of the three welfare dimensions will have the same
weight in the Multidimensional Welfare Index (MWI). The following is the formula to
obtain the MWI:
P
ðSSDI þ CDI þ ODIÞ
MWI ¼

4.2 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Critics
One of the disadvantages of PCA, as a method to reduce variables, is its high sensitivity to
incorporation and presence of outliers. Further, the method tends to minimize the contribution
of variables that have a different evolution or path from that of other indicators. This technique seeks homogeneity, rather than plurality of behaviors, and can be applied only when
significant correlations exist (Schuschny and Soto 2009, pp. 58–59). Another important point
to note is that, if the variables to be analyzed have a low standard deviation, they will have a
low weight or load in the PCA (Vyas and Kumaranayake 2006, p. 461). Data that is presented
category-wise (such as religion, ethnicity, gender, etc.) is not suitable for PCA, because the
categories have to be converted into a quantitative scale that will not yield any coherent result.
To overcome this problem, qualitative categorical variables should be recoded as binary
variables (Vyas and Kumaranayake 2006, p. 463). All this debate about the use of PCA
reflects that the main components are indices constructed artificially; PCA critics argue that
this technique is arbitrary, because the method of choosing the number of components, and of
the variables to be analyzed, is not well defined (Vyas and Kumaranayake 2006, p. 467).
The success of PCA in the reduction of variables depends on its ability to sum up a
substantial proportion of the variance in the data with the least amount of components
(indexes) and, if the components are more than one, it should be able to interpret each
component meaningfully. It is also important to assess the effectiveness of PCA, where it can
explain only a small proportion of the variance in the data analyzed by the first principal
component. Paying attention to the variables included in the PCA is also important, especially in terms of checking their appropriateness to the objectives of the analysis (Abeyasekera 2002, p. 18). In spite of the disadvantages pointed out by some authors, PCA was
considered an appropriate tool for this study in reducing the number of indicators.

5 Multidimensional Welfare Index (MWI) Results: R
To calculate the Multidimensional Welfare Index (MWI), various mathematical calculations had to be performed and ‘‘R’’ was used to compute them. As mentioned in the
methodology section, before performing the PCA in each of the three individual indexes,
the correlation between indicators was to be tested through a correlation matrix with data
from the 17 cases (countries); the higher the correlation, the fewer would be the number of
8

An arithmetic mean was used to reduce the 3 indexes (SSDI, CDI and ODI) to the composite MWI.
Because the SSDI, CDI and ODI have the same range (0–1) there was no need to use the geometric mean as
in the new HDI method.

resulting components when performing the PCA. It will be ideal if there is only one
resulting component after the PCA; that way, one index will represent each dimension.
5.1 Data Correlation
Looking at the correlation matrix, a positive correlation can be inferred between the
indicators of each dimension. Variables of each dimension presented correlations above
0.50 in the correlation matrix, which confirm that when performing the PCA, the first
principal component of each dimension should be able to summarize the information and
may serve as individual dimensional index. Because correlation matrix, and not covariance
matrix, was used in the PCA, individual indicators were given equal weight in forming the
major components (Dunteman 1989, pp. 22–23).
Once the level of correlation among the indicators was checked and found to be high, two
tests were necessary on each data set to assess the statistical relevance of the PCA and to
confirm that the correlation between variables was high. The first test was the determinant of
the correlation matrix. The determinant was calculated in R, and the result is as follows:
> det(cor(SSDI))

> det(cor(CDI))

> det(cor(ODI))

[1] 0.0791064

[1] 0.2163995

[1] 0.7473191

Even though the determinants of each correlation matrix were not as low as the
determinant of the correlation matrix obtained from using the eight (8) welfare indicators
(9.079839e-05), continuing with the PCA was found to be feasible.
The second test was Bartlett’s sphericity. The test was calculated in R and the results,
for each index, are as follows:
> bartlett.test(SSDI)
Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances
data: SSDI
Bartlett's K-squared = 177.7924, df = 2, p-value < 2.2e-16
> bartlett.test(CDI)
Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances
data: CDI
Bartlett's K-squared = 15.3828, df = 2, p-value = 0.0004567
> bartlett.test(ODI)
Bartlett test of homogeneity of variances
data: ODI
Bartlett's K-squared = 31.5613, df = 1, p-value = 1.932e-0

The Bartlett’s test of sphericity confirmed the statistical relevance of the PCA, because
the value of the test could be considered relatively high in each index and the reliability or
p value of each of the three individual indexes is also much lower than 0.05, the critical
value.

5.2 Principal Component Analysis (PCA)9
For PCA, the function pca(x, cor = TRUE) under the library (labdsv) was used on R. This
function uses prcomp (x), but includes different conventions for graphing and analyzing
that will be used throughout this paper (Roberts n.d.).
David Roberts, author of the pca(x) function, notes that this function allows the
researcher to specify the number of parameters on the calculation of the PCA. It has to be
decided in advance whether to use correlation matrix or covariance. PCA is sensitive to the
scale on which measured data is used in the analysis. Roberts recommends using PCA for a
correlation matrix, because by doing so, all variables are treated equally (standardized
mean = 0 and SD = 1). Although all variables are measured on the same scale, Roberts
recommends using the same correlation matrix to prevent the key variables from determining the outcome. In R, this means specifying cor = TRUE when writing the function
pca(x). In addition, this function will generate an eigenvector for each column (variable)
and a score for each row (Roberts n.d.).10
The results of PCA are on the expected lines; each index finished with as many components as the indicators used in the PCA. The aim of this analysis was to reduce the
dimensions of welfare to the fewest possible indexes, losing minimum possible variance
from the indicators used. But, how many principal components need to be retained without
losing much information?
5.3 Interruption Rules for Retaining Principal Components
There are several general guidelines or rules for interruption in PCA. They are used to
know when to stop the inclusion of retaining components in the analysis. Kaiser Criterion,
scree plot and comprehensibility are the three rules most employed by methodologists, and
they were applied to each index data.
Kaiser Criterion: To obtain the results of the eigenvalues, it was necessary to use the
function eigen(cor[x]) in R and the results are as follows:
> eigen(cor(SSDI))
$values
[1] 2.6455137 0.2161411 0.1383452
> eigen(cor(CDI))
$values
[1] 2.3574003 0.4282473 0.2143524
> eigen(cor(ODI))
$values
[1] 1.5026738 0.4973262

Kaiser criterion states that all factors or components, each with an eigenvalue below 1.0,
be left out of the analysis. If this criterion is fulfilled, then it will be confirmed that only the
first component, in each of the three (3) data sets, will be necessary for each index
construction.
9

Efforts are being made to increase the number of cases and to find other possibilities to overcome
the problem of ‘‘too many variables, too few cases’’.

Scree plot:
Catell (1965) proposed to continue the analysis with the components that presented
eigenvalues prior to the sharp drop in the graph. By applying this rule to Figs. 1, 2 and 3, it
can be reconfirmed that only the first principal component would be retained.
Comprehensibility:
Comprehensibility is the final criterion to be used for retention of key components.
There is a consensus that the components be limited to as many as those whose meaning
can be understood. According to this research, retaining only the first principal component
is considered understandable, because the idea is to construct three welfare indexes, which
will be combined to build the MWI. The high proportion of variance that is accounted for
by the first principal component supports this comprehensibility. The first component alone
accounts for over 75 % of the data variance; more specifically 88.18 % for the SSDI,
78.58 % for the CDI and 75.13 for the ODI.
5.4 Principal Component PC Scores and Individual Welfare Index
To decide on the number of principal components to be retained in the PCA, the results of
the three tests carried out, or the criteria used, were analyzed and it was decided to retain
only the first principal component for each of the three individual indexes. Using the pc
scores from the first principal component, the three individual welfare indexes (SSDI, CDI
and ODI) were constructed.
In Tables 2, 3 and 4, the second column shows the pc score for each country, and the
third column the individual welfare index after standardization of the data through a
rescaling method. The indexes were standardized to make the data more comprehensible

6 Multidimensional Welfare Index (MWI) Analysis
After combining the three individual welfare indexes using the formula proposed in the
methodology section, the MWI was constructed (See Table 5). Several conclusions can be
deduced from the data of this Table, depending on the type of analysis made. In the
following section, the rationale behind dividing the countries into three groups is briefly
explained, followed by a brief analysis of the three groups, according to their MWI values
and sample average values.
6.1 Division of Countries into Three Groups According to Their Degree of Welfare
Development
After analyzing the data in Table 5, the first thing that attracts the reader’s attention is the
division of the 17 Latin American countries into three groups. The first group, comprising
Puerto Rico, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile, is called ‘‘countries with a relatively high
degree of welfare state development’’. The second group, composed of Costa Rica, Brazil,
Panama, Venezuela and Mexico, is called ‘‘countries with a medium degree of welfare
state development’’. The third group, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Dominican Republic, El
Salvador, Paraguay, Bolivia and Guatemala, is called ‘‘countries with a relatively low
degree welfare state development’’.
The original plan, at the beginning of this research, was to adopt the division of the
countries into two groups, as developed by Segura-Ubiergo (2007, p. 30, Table 2.1):

countries with medium–high welfare development and countries with medium–low welfare
development. But after analyzing and observing the standardized MWI results in the last
column of Table 5, it was considered more appropriate to group the countries into three
categories, instead of two: (1) countries with MWI values ranging from 1.000 to 0.666; (2)

Countries are grouped according to their MWI result. Puerto Rico, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile with MWI
results between 0.66 and 1.00 are considered countries with a relative high welfare state development. Costa
Rica, Brazil, Panamá, Venezuela and México countries with MWI results between 0.33 and 0.65 are
considered countries with an intermediate welfare state development. Colombia, Ecuador, Perú, Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Paraguay, Bolivia and Guatemala with MWI results between 0.00 and 0.32 are
considered countries with a relative low welfare state development. MWI is a composite indicator formed by
8 indicators from 3 welfare dimensions and used to rank countries in terms of their relative welfare state
development

countries with MWI values ranging from 0.665 to 0.333; and (3) countries with MWI
values between 0.332 and 0.000.
Countries with an MWI value within the first tertile, would be considered as countries
with a relatively high degree of welfare state development, those within the second tertile
as countries with medium degree of welfare state development, and those within the third
tertile as countries with a relatively low degree of welfare state development.

123

1312

G. Cruz-Martı́nez

The MWI was standardized to facilitate an understanding of the results—in comparative terms, not absolute terms—where the number 1 represents the country with
the most developed welfare state in the sample, and zero the country with least
developed welfare state. The understanding had to be on comparative terms, because
MWI value of 1 for Puerto Rico and zero value for Guatemala do not mean that
Puerto Rico has a fully developed welfare state and Guatemala a totally undeveloped
one. Rather, it means that within the sample of the 17 countries, the one that is listed
first has the most developed welfare state and the one listed last the least developed
welfare state. This reasoning also applies to each of the three indexes (SSDI, CDI, and
ODI). In the future, when other Latin American countries be added to the analysis, one
may notice changes in the MWI values of most countries. This is because the standardized values depend not only on the higher and lower ranked cases, but also on the
values of the remaining countries.
6.2 Analysis of the Three Welfare Groups According to Their Sample Averages
in the Multidimensional Welfare Index
Based on MWI, how does one assess the extent by which a group of countries is more
developed or less developed in comparison with any other group? This can be done by
using the three welfare indexes. The welfare state development of a group of countries can
be assessed by just using a one-dimensional index of welfare as reference.
The average MWI value (0.830) of the group of countries with a high welfare state
development (first group) is 1.78 more than the corresponding value of the countries with a
medium welfare state development (second group), 5.52 times more than the value of the
countries with a low welfare state (third group), and 2.06 times more than the sample
average.
The average MWI value of the second group countries (0.466) represents 56.18 % of
the corresponding value of the first group countries; it is 3.10 times more than the value of
the third group countries and 1.16 times more than the sample average.
The average MWI value of the third group countries (0.150) represents 18.11 % of the
corresponding value of the first group countries; it is 32.24 % of the value of the third
group countries, and 37.28 % of the sample average value.

7 Limitations
This work presents two notable limitations related to the data used. The first limitation is
the unavailability of data for all cases during the period considered in the analysis. It is
impossible to know the effect it may have had the inclusion of the missing data, but it is
essential to consider this limitation. The collections of data by government agencies and
national statistics institutes were scarce during the decades of 1970s and 1980s, which
among other things limits the availability of the data.
Another limitation is the use of different sources for the countries within each indicator.
This argument could be based under the assumption that the results are not as reliable as

123

Welfare State Development

1313

having all data from each cases and indicators. If it is difficult to find all the data for the
study period, still more difficult is finding the data from the same source. Moreover the
international databases such as ECLAC, World Bank, SEDLAS, among others were not as
developed period as in the present.

8 Conclusion
After a thorough analysis of Segura-Ubiergo’s (2007) welfare effort index as a measure of
the degree of welfare development in Latin America, it was concluded that his index lays
unduly high emphasis on the spending dimension of welfare. Nonetheless, his index served
as an inspiration to design a new welfare index that takes into account the multidimensionality of welfare. Using PCA, a multidimensional welfare index was built with three
individual welfare indexes. These indexes represent three dimensions of welfare: spending,
coverage and outcomes of welfare institutions. The composite nature of this multidimensional index rendered comparative analysis of the welfare state development in 17
Latin American and Caribbean countries possible.
The results of the comparative analysis carried out on the basis of the proposed Multidimensional Welfare Index show that Puerto Rico, Argentina, Chile and Uruguay have
the most developed welfare state in the Latin American region; Costa Rica, Brazil, Panamá, Venezuela and México have an intermediate degree of welfare state development,
whereas Colombia, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, Perú, El Salvador, Paraguay, Bolivia
and Guatemala have the least developed welfare state. It would be worthwhile to continue
looking for other possible dimensions of welfare and indicators that can serve as more
comprehensive and objective multidimensional welfare indexes.
The actual economic crisis is a reminder of how the market failures can affect the well
being of the society and why the welfare state is a key element in assuring a dignified life
for every individual. It is desirable that developing countries continue building their
welfare states so that in future cyclic economic recessions/crisis/failures the population
could have at least their basic social needs covered through an institutionalized welfare
state.
An additional point to note here is that if countries with a high level of welfare
development, such as Sweden, Finland, Denmark, and Iceland were included in this
analysis, then possibly no country in Latin America can qualify to be within the group of
countries of highly developed welfare state. This is because these results are relative and
comparable only among Latin American and the Caribbean countries.

percentage of population covered by at least a social security program circa 1980, percentage of employees with retirement coverage, and hospital beds per ten thousand
inhabitants represent the coverage of welfare programs dimension. The percentage of population with high level of education, and the improbability of suffering infant
