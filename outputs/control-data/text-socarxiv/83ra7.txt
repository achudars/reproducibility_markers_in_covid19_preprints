Abstract
This study examined the relation of sexual identity-related victimization in the form of
stigmatizing microaggressions with past-year depression symptoms and suicide ideation among a
sample of sexual minority (SM) persons (ùëõ = 167). Multiple logistic regression models found
that for each event increase in average weekly frequency of stigmatizing microaggression events,
odds of past-year suicide ideation increased by 68% (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.68, 95%
confidence interval [CI] [1.14, 2.43]), past-year hopelessness or sadness for two weeks or more
increased by 56% (AOR = 1.56, 95% CI [1.04, 2.30]), and past-year withdrawal from regular
activities increased by 186% (AOR = 2.86, 95% CI [1.52, 4.94]). An additional socioecological
factor, living in the U.S. South, was associated with substantially increased odds of suicide
ideation (AOR = 3.89, 95% CI [1.15, 13.84]) and hopelessness/sadness (AOR = 4.32, 95% CI
[1.28, 15.91]). Findings of this study indicate that frequent and more subtle sexual identityrelated victimization in the form of microaggressions, in addition to overt victimization such as
physical or sexual violence, may negatively impact the mental health of SM persons.

Stigmatizing Microaggressions, Depression Symptoms, and Suicide Ideation among a
Geographically-diverse Sample of Sexual Minority Persons
Suicide and its determinants are increasingly recognized as a public health crisis, a
syndemic of interlinking social and psychological risk factors that have contributed to reduced
life expectancy in the United States (Hong, Espelage, & Kral, 2011; Murphy, Xu, Kochanek, &
Arias, 2018). Suicide disproportionately impacts sexual minority (SM) individuals, including
those identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, or questioning (Hong et al., 2011; McManama
O‚ÄôBrien, Salas-Wright, Vaughn, & LeCloux, 2015; Mustanski, Andrews, Herrick, Stall, &
Schnarrs, 2014). In meta-analytic samples, 11‚Äì20% of SM adults have attempted suicide in their
lifetime, two to five times greater than rates among heterosexual persons (Hottes, Bogaert,
Rhodes, Brennan, & Gesink, 2016). Primary studies and epidemiological data report rates of
lifetime suicide attempt of up to 31% in SM adults and 37% in SM youth, while approximately
40% of SM adolescents and adults report recent suicide ideation (Eisenberg & Resnick, 2006;
Hottes et al., 2016; Kann et al., 2016; McBee-Strayer & Rogers, 2002; McManama O‚ÄôBrien et
al., 2015). An array of socioecological and intraindividual factors have been linked with
depression and suicidality among SM persons (see Hong et al., 2011, for a comprehensive
review), with one important domain of environmental risk factors being sexual identity-related
victimization experiences. For instance, bullying or threats or enactments of violence related to
sexual or gender-minority identity are associated with a nearly three-fold increase in odds of
depression symptoms and a 3.5-fold increase in odds of suicide attempt, and among sexual
minorities specifically, victimization experiences mediate the relation between sexual minority
identity and depression and suicidality longitudinally (Burton, Marshal, Chisolm, Sucato, &
Friedman, 2013; Shields, Whitaker, Glassman, Franks, & Howard, 2012). The types of sexual

STIGMATIZING MICROAGGRESSIONS AND SUICIDALITY

identity-related victimization examined in much of the existing literature may be described as
overt: involving pronounced acts of discrimination or victimization such as physical and sexual
threats and violence, bullying, denial of services, employment or housing loss, and social and
family rejection. Importantly, experiences of overt victimization do not fully account for
disparities in suicide risk between SM and heterosexual-identifying individuals, and other
potential etiological factors for suicidality among SM must be considered (Paceley, Goffnett, &
Gandy-Guedes, 2017).
Sexual identity-related victimization in the form of microaggressions ‚Äì brief, frequent,
and sometimes subtle experiences which convey stigmatization, objectification, or rejection of
sexual minority identities ‚Äì has been proposed as an additional socioecological risk factor for
poor mental health outcomes among SM populations (Nadal, Rivera, & Corpus, 2010; Sue et al.,
2007). Several typologies of stigmatizing microaggressions have been developed, and broadly,
these microaggressions take the form of a) use of heterosexist terminology (e.g., referring to an
undesirable situation or behavior as ‚Äúgay‚Äù), b) endorsement of heteronormative cultural norms
(e.g., an expectation that sexual minority identity will not be openly discussed), c) assumption of
a universal sexual minority experience (e.g., suggesting that someone does not meet stereotypes
of their sexual identity), d) objectification or exoticization (e.g., being stared at in public), e)
discomfort or disapproval of sexual minority identity (e.g., being told one‚Äôs sexual identity is a
‚Äúphase‚Äù or is sinful), f) denial of societal heterosexism (e.g., disputing that sexual minorities are
systematically marginalized), g) assumption of pathology (e.g., insinuating that a sexual minority
person is a predator, or is deviant or mentally ill), or h) denial of individual heterosexism (e.g.,
becoming defensive when one is confronted about heterosexist behavior) (Nadal et al., 2010;
Parr & Howe, 2019; Platt & Lenzen, 2013; Sue, 2010). The majority of studies focusing on

STIGMATIZING MICROAGGRESSIONS AND SUICIDALITY
stigmatizing microaggressions among SM have used qualitative methods to more fully
characterize variation in types of microaggressions and in the settings in which they occur.
Limited quantitative research has been carried out to estimate the frequency with which
stigmatizing microaggressions are experienced by SM populations, or the association of those
experiences with outcomes such as depression and suicidality. A small number of recent studies
have found that nonphysical victimization (not characterized explicitly as microaggressions),
including overhearing stigmatizing conversation, shunning, or teasing, is associated with
depression, anxiety, and additive stress among SM persons (Almeida, Johnson, Corliss, Molnar,
& Azrael, 2009; Robinson & Espelage, 2012). Another study recently examined the relation of
stigmatizing microaggressions and cigarette smoking behaviors among SM university students,
and found that past-year experience of microaggressions is associated with a nearly two-fold
increase in odds of smoking (Ylioja, Cochran, Woodford, & Renn, 2018).
Understanding the role of stigmatizing microaggressions in relation to depression and
suicide risk is critical. Indeed, because stigmatizing microaggressions likely occur with greater
frequency than overt victimization (e.g., acts of physical or sexual violence), it is possible that
the commonplace experience of microaggressions may lead to a chronic perception of
stigmatization and social rejection among SM youth and adults (Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Meyer,
2003; Parr & Howe, 2019). Further, it is conceivable that this ongoing stigmatization may lead
SM individuals to concealment of their identity, a behavior that itself is associated with
depression, relationship strain, poorer HIV-related outcomes, and lower overall psychological
and physiological quality of life (Quinn, Weisz, & Lawner, 2017; Ullrich, Lutgendorf, &
Stapleton, 2003). Given a dearth of quantitative studies investigating the associations of
depression and suicidality among SM with experiences of stigmatizing microaggressions, we

5

aimed to examine these relations in the present study. Specifically, we used an online survey to
assess the weekly frequency with which SM individuals experience eight different stigmatizing
microaggressions as well as past-year depression symptoms and suicide ideation. We then tested
hypotheses that increased weekly frequency of stigmatizing microaggressions would be
independently associated with greater odds of past-year suicide ideation, past-year sadness or
hopelessness for two weeks or more, and past-year withdrawal from regular activities while
adjusting for sociodemographic variables that may be associated with increased mental health
risk. Because respondents represented major geographic regions of the United States, we had a
secondary interest in whether region of residence had an explanatory role in depression and
suicidality among SM respondents, in light of prior findings that (overt) victimization does not
fully explain these outcomes among SM individuals and that they may in part result from
unsupportive community climate (Paceley et al., 2017). All phases of research were approved by
the University of Oregon Institutional Review Board.
Method
Data for the present study were drawn from a two-phase study which aimed to identify
specific identity-related microaggressions experienced by both sexual and gender minority
individuals, and to quantitatively assess the frequency and self-rated intensity with which they
occur. Full details of that study can be found in Parr and Howe (2019). In brief, the first phase of
study consisted of three focus groups held across the U.S., in which non-transgender sexual
minority and transgender participants were prompted to describe experiences of identity-related
microaggressions. Thirty-six adolescents and adults, ranging in age from 15‚Äì55 years,
participated in focus groups; of those endorsing a sexual minority identity, six identified as
lesbian, nine as gay, five as bisexual, and two as other. From the focus group analysis, 14

specific stigmatizing microaggressions were identified as commonly experienced by sexual and
gender minority participants. These microaggressions were adapted into situational prompts to be
included in an online survey questionnaire, which was disseminated via email lists of
organizations serving sexual and gender minority persons, and social media platforms and online
forums with user bases of sexual and gender minority individuals. An informed consent
procedure was integrated into the survey platform. Inclusion criteria were being at least 14 years
of age and a U.S. resident, and there were no specific exclusion criteria. Parental notification or
consent was not required for minor participants‚Äô involvement in the study to minimize risk of
unwanted or unintentional disclosure of their sexual and/or gender identity. Data were collected
over an approximately one-month period, during which 841 responses were initiated. Following
implementation of an 80% completion threshold, 402 responses remained. Of these, 167
respondents identified as a non-transgender sexual minority, and these participants comprise the
present sample. For the purposes of this study, non-transgender sexual minority is defined as
self-identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or other, as well as cisgender female or male,
genderqueer/gender non-conforming, or other. Because a number of the microaggressions
included in the survey questionnaire were relevant primarily to transgender individuals (e.g.,
related to gender confirmation procedures; see Measures section), the subsample of participants
who self-identified as transgender were analyzed separately (see Parr and Howe, 2019).
Demographic information for participants included in the present study is provided in Table 1.
Measures
Accompanying each situational prompt adapted from stigmatizing microaggressions
reported in focus groups was an item assessing the weekly frequency with which participants
experienced each microaggression event. In the current study, this item was used to calculate

STIGMATIZING MICROAGGRESSIONS AND SUICIDALITY

8

each participant‚Äôs average weekly number of microaggressions experienced. Of the 14
microaggressions included in the survey, eight were pertinent to both sexual and gender minority
persons (Table 2) and were used to calculate the average frequency variable used in the analyses
described below. Frequency item internal consistency was assessed prior to calculating means
and was high (ùõº = .89). Additional measures included participant age category, annual income,
education level, U.S. region of residence, and demographic area of residence (urban, suburban,
or rural). Participant race/ethnicity was collected but was not used in analyses due to substantial
imbalance (see Table 1). Outcomes of interest were measured using an item from the Suicide
Behaviors Questionnaire‚ÄìRevised (Osman et al., 2001) assessing past-year suicide ideation
(‚ÄúHow often have you thought about killing yourself in the past year?‚Äù), and two additional items
assessing past-year depression symptomatology including sadness or hopelessness (‚ÄúDuring the
past year, did you ever feel sad or hopeless almost every day for 2 weeks or more?‚Äù) and
withdrawal from regular activities (‚ÄúDuring the past year, did you ever feel so sad or hopeless
that you stopped doing some usual activities?‚Äù). Depression items were dichotomous, and for
analyses the suicide item was also dichotomized with zero representing no past-year suicide
ideation and one indicating endorsement of any past-year ideation.1 Because of the inclusion of
items related to suicide, contact information for suicide prevention lifelines including the U.S.
National Suicide Prevention Lifeline and two lifelines serving sexual and gender minority
persons was provided to participants at the conclusion of the survey.
Analytic Approach
Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to examine a priori hypotheses. As
commonly occurs in logistic regression settings with multiple predictor variables, partial

separation was observed on some control variables during initial model fitting (here, on age and
education variables). Separation occurs when a linear combination of independent or control
variables (or category levels of those variables) perfectly predicts a binary outcome, resulting in
extreme inferences for those variables or levels and in the model being unidentified (Albert &
Anderson, 1984; Lesaffre & Albert, 1989). While a routine challenge in logistic regression
models, separation is also routinely mishandled by, for instance, removing predictors on which
separation is found (Gelman, Jakulin, Pittau, & Su, 2008). Despite the instability in model
estimation introduced by those variables, however, their precise prediction of the outcome is
valuable and their exclusion from the model removes explanatory information (Zorn, 2005).
Here, we address separation by implementing an approach developed by Gelman et al. (2008)
that uses a partially Bayesian method of model estimation. This procedure maintains the
estimation algorithm typical for logistic regression (iteratively-weighted least squares) and
implements a conservative Student-ùë° distribution to estimate model parameters, while
incorporating a flexible and minimally-informative prior distribution to stabilize estimation of
parameters exhibiting separation. The behavior of this prior distribution, known as a Cauchy
prior, is to yield appropriate estimates of coefficients which would otherwise be unidentified due
to separation, while leaving other coefficients (e.g., microaggression frequency) substantively
unchanged (Gelman et al., 2008). We implemented this modelling technique for the present
analyses, and conducted sensitivity analyses comparing the standard logistic regression estimates
of non-separated variables we obtained during initial model fitting to those of the same variables
in the fully-identified models that incorporated the Cauchy prior.
Three diagnostic measures were used to evaluate overall model specification and fit.
First, residual quantile-quantile and residual vs. fitted values plots were inspected. Residuals of

STIGMATIZING MICROAGGRESSIONS AND SUICIDALITY

10

logistic regression models are often not directly interpretable because the outcome variable is
discrete, creating the condition in which multiple values of a (continuous) predictor variable are
associated with the same outcome level. To produce interpretable diagnostic plots, a simulation
approach similar to bootstrapping was used to generate an empirical cumulative density
distribution of expected residuals. From this distribution, scaled standardized residuals
corresponding to the observed data were drawn and plotted, with diagnostic plot interpretation
then analogous to that of linear regression models (Dunn & Smyth, 1996; Hartig, 2019). Visual
inspection and Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov tests were then used to assess model misspecification and
departures of residuals from normality. Additionally, model explained deviance (ùê∑% ) was
calculated and deviance tests conducted to assess the significance of reduction in residual
deviance of full models in comparison to null models with no predictors. Finally, the area under
a receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for each full model. This statistic
quantifies the predictive ability of a model to discriminate between the two values of the
dichotomous outcome variable. An AUC of .5 indicates that the model performs no better than
chance at selecting the outcome level based on levels of the predictors, while a value of 1.0
indicates the model perfectly discriminates between the outcome values based on the included
predictors. Following evaluation of model fit, model coefficients were exponentiated to adjusted
odds ratios (AORs) to provide interpretable effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for
AORs were generated from exponentiated bootstrapped sample percentiles. For all analyses,
statistical significance was assessed using the bootstrapped CIs (i.e., when an AOR of one was
excluded from the interval). All analyses were conducted using R Version 3.6.0 (R Core Team,
2018; RStudio Team, 2018). Multiple logistic regression models implementing the method
described above were fitted using the ‚Äúbayesglm‚Äù function in the arm package (Gelman & Su,

STIGMATIZING MICROAGGRESSIONS AND SUICIDALITY

11

2018) and standardized residual calculation and plotting were carried out using the DHARMa
package (Hartig, 2019).
Results
Descriptive Findings
Sociodemographic characteristics of study participants are provided in Table 1. Gay or
lesbian participants made up 28.7% of the sample and individuals identifying as bisexual
comprised a similar proportion (27.5%); 43.7% endorsed a sexual orientation of other.
Descriptive details for stigmatizing microaggression items are show in Table 2. The most
frequently-occurring microaggression event was observing one‚Äôs identity depicted in the media
as an abnormality or curiosity, experienced on average 2.32 times per week (SD = 1.94) and
reported as occurring at least once per week by 82.4% of SM participants. The next most
frequent stigmatizing microaggression was being stared at in public because of one‚Äôs identity (on
average 2.16 events each week, SD = 2.02), and 71.7% of participants experienced this
microaggression at least once per week. The least frequent microaggression was being labeled a
predator or seen as a danger to others because of one‚Äôs identity (0.39 events per week, SD =
0.89); nevertheless, nearly one-quarter (22.4%) of participants indicated they experienced this
microaggression at least once per week. Microaggressions taking place in media or public
contexts occurred more frequently (range = 0.88‚Äì2.32 events per week) than interpersonal
microaggressions (range = 0.39‚Äì1.22). Past-year suicide ideation was reported by 62.8% of
participants, 67.1% reported past-year sadness or hopelessness for two weeks or more, and
75.4% endorsed past-year withdrawal from regular activities.
Inferential Findings

STIGMATIZING MICROAGGRESSIONS AND SUICIDALITY

12

Fewer than 1% of participant responses were missing; remaining missing data were
primarily on sociodemographic control variables and appeared nonrandom (e.g., non-response on
most demographic variables). Consequently, these observations (ùëõ = 6) were excluded from
analyses, leaving an analytic sample of ùëõ = 161. Correlation among independent and control
variables was also evaluated before model fitting and was minimal (median ùëü = .02, range = .17‚Äì.53). Following model fitting and scaling and standardization of model residuals, all final
models exhibited residual normality in visual inspection of quantile-quantile plots and
nonsignificant Kolmogorov‚ÄìSmirnov tests. Further, no distinct patterning of model residuals was
found in residual vs. fitted values plots, suggesting that residuals were uniform across predictor
levels. Remaining model fit indicators are presented in Table 3. In deviance tests, all final
models significantly reduced deviance in comparison to null models for each outcome, and
AUCs calculated for each model ranged from .78‚Äì.79 (indicating fairly good discrimination
among outcome levels). Lastly, as noted above, a sensitivity analysis (not shown) was carried out
to compare standard logistic regression estimates on non-separated variables with coefficients of
the same variables estimated using models incorporating a minimally informative stabilizing
prior to address separation. In all cases, parameter estimates of the models using the Cauchy
prior were either directly comparable to those of the standard logistic regression, or somewhat
more conservative. The latter condition is likely reflective of the Student-ùë° distribution applied to
coefficient estimation. Further, extreme parameter estimates found in the standard regressions
with evident separation were resolved in the final models that included the stabilizing prior, and
reasonable and interpretable estimates were achieved (described next).
Experiencing higher average weekly frequency of stigmatizing microaggressions was
found to be associated with significantly greater odds of experiencing all outcome variables

STIGMATIZING MICROAGGRESSIONS AND SUICIDALITY

13

among SM participants (Table 3). For each event increase in average weekly frequency of
microaggression events, odds of past-year suicide ideation increased by 68% (AOR = 1.68, 95%
CI [1.14, 2.43]) when adjusting for participant age, annual income, education level, and U.S.
region and demographic area of residence. For depression symptom variables, each event
increase in average weekly microaggression frequency was associated with a 56% increase in
odds of past-year hopelessness or sadness for two weeks or more (AOR = 1.56, 95% CI [1.04,
2.30]) and a 186% increase in odds of past-year withdrawal from regular activities (AOR = 2.86,
95% CI [1.52, 4.94]), when adjusting for sociodemographic factors. With regard to the region of
residence variable, living in the U.S. South2 is associated with a 3.9-fold increase in past-year
suicide ideation (AOR = 3.89, 95% CI [1.15, 13.84]) and a 4.3-fold increase in past-year
hopelessness or sadness for two weeks or more (AOR = 4.32, 95% CI [1.28, 15.91]) for SM
participants, compared to living in the Pacific West3 and when adjusting for participant age,
income, education, demographic area, and for stigmatizing microaggression frequency. Finally,
while the annual income variable was primarily included to adjust for other potential influences
of suicidality and depression, increasing annual income above US$35,000 was found to be
associated with substantially reduced odds of past-year suicide ideation in comparison to the
lowest income category (earning less than US$20,000 annually) when adjusting for other
sociodemographic factors and for microaggression frequency. Decreases ranged from 74% lower
odds of past-year suicide ideation for those earning US$35,000‚Äì49,999 each year (AOR = 0.26,
95% CI [0.08, 0.78]), to 84% lower odds for those earning over US$100,000 each year (AOR =
0.16, 95% CI [0.04, 0.71]). For those with an annual income of US$50,000‚Äì74,999, odds of past-

[0.08, 0.91]) in comparison to those with the lowest income and when adjusting for other
sociodemographic factors and for microaggression frequency.
Discussion and Implications
To more fully understand and intervene to reduce disproportionate rates of suicide among
sexual minorities, it is important to utilize a socioecological view of the risk environment
occupied by this population (Hong et al., 2011). Indeed, while individual-level determinants such
as comorbid mental health concerns (e.g., depression) may partially account for suicide ideation
or attempt among sexual minorities, increased risk of suicidality is likely the result of
interactions among individual and socioecological risk factors (Mustanski et al., 2014; Stall,
Friedman, & Catania, 2008). Among these risk factors, evidence has accumulated that
experiences of overt sexual identity-related victimization are harmful to the mental health and
wellbeing of SM populations (Burton et al., 2013; Hong et al., 2011; Shields et al., 2012).
Findings of this study extend this body of research by further characterizing the risk environment
experienced by SM individuals. We found that more subtle forms of sexual identity-related
victimization ‚Äì stigmatizing microaggressions ‚Äì are associated with increased odds of past-year
sadness or hopelessness, withdrawal from regular activities, and suicide ideation. Moreover, we
identified a substantial independent relation that among SM participants, living in the U.S. South
is associated with elevated risk of suicide ideation and withdrawal from regular activities. This
finding aligns with prior research that has linked less supportive or tolerant community climates
with increased occurrence of sexual identity-related victimization and risk of depression (Paceley
et al., 2017). Finally, microaggressions occurring in media and public contexts were generally
more frequent than interpersonal microaggressions, an important finding for characterizing how

STIGMATIZING MICROAGGRESSIONS AND SUICIDALITY

15

microaggressions may produce chronic states of perceived societal, in addition to interpersonal,
stigmatization (Hatzenbuehler, 2009; Meyer, 2003; Parr & Howe, 2019).
A limitation of this study is that, as a cross-sectional survey design, causal relations
among microaggression frequency, region of residence, and mental health outcomes could not be
ascertained. Further, representation of racial or ethnic minority SM individuals was limited in
our sample, preventing inference on additive or multiplicative relations that race/ethnicity may
have with SM identity and microaggressions (i.e., multiple minority identity; Balsam, Molina,
Beadnell, Simoni, & Walters, 2011; Meyer, 2003). Future studies of sexual minority-related
victimization should implement sampling strategies that ensure greater representation of racial or
ethnic minority SM persons, particularly as this population experiences elevated risk of
victimization in comparison to white (non-Hispanic) SM individuals (see Balsam et al., 2011).
Finally, while there were significant findings for the U.S. South region of residence variable
level, the wide CIs suggest that the magnitude of the relation between living in the southern U.S.
and suicide ideation and depression symptomatology could not be precisely estimated using this
sample of SM persons.
Findings of this study along with others noted suggest that the socioecological risk
environment experienced by SM individuals is characterized by several pathways to elevated risk
of depression and suicidality: experiences of overt victimization and discrimination, such as
physical or sexual violence, job or housing loss, or rejection; chronic exposure to more subtle
victimization in the form of stigmatizing microaggressions; and ongoing experiences of
community or family nonsupport or nonacceptance. Realistically, the lived experience of many
SM individuals may include several or all of these pathways interacting syndemically, such that
acts of overt victimization, happening more rarely, are punctuated by frequent or everyday

STIGMATIZING MICROAGGRESSIONS AND SUICIDALITY

16

experiences of stigmatizing microaggressions or other expressions of nonsupport based on an
individual‚Äôs sexual identity. Consequently, many SM persons may be faced with expressing their
identity, which may elevate their risk of overt and microaggressive victimization, or concealing
their identity, which itself impacts psychosocial health (Quinn et al., 2017; Ullrich et al., 2003).
Taken together, currently-available evidence underlines the need for broad implementation of
interventions to enhance the inclusivity of environments SM persons regularly experience (e.g.,
school or university climates; Burk, Park, & Saewyc, 2018), and highlights the need for
systematic efforts to bring greater awareness to the numerous ways sexual identity-related stigma
can be subtly or unintentionally communicated in everyday life.
