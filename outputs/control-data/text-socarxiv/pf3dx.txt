Bell Beaker resilience? The 4.2ka BP event and its implications for environments and societies in
Northwest Europe
Jos Kleijne, Mara Weinelt, Johannes Müller
Abstract
This paper deals with the Bell Beaker phenomenon in Northwest Europe, and the question of its
development around 2200 BC, in relation to the well-known 4.2ka climatic event. The duration of
settlement occupation and the subsistence economy are the variables used in this study to address
this resilience on a regional scale. Concluding, we state that regional variability exists in the ways in
which communities were impacted by the 4.2ka event. In addition to agricultural intensification, the
flexibility of subsistence strategies seems to have played an important role.

Introduction
From 2600 BC onwards, Western and Central Europe are characterised by what archaeologists have
historically labelled as “the Bell Beaker phenomenon” (e.g. Vander Linden 2013). In various parts of
Europe, especially the Iberian Peninsula, the end of this phenomenon is often considered to date
around 2200 BC, with the rise of the El Argar civilisation in the Southeast of the Peninsula, associated
with significant changes in social organisation, settlement structure and food economy (Lull et al
2015). The role of climate in the demise of the Bell Beaker phenomenon, and the resilience and
vulnerability of prehistoric communities, is currently being debated (e.g. Blanco-Gonzalez et al 2018;
Hinz et al in press). Specifically, an abrupt climatic event around 2200 BC, commonly known as ‘the
4.2ka event’, has a well attested influence on human society in other parts of the world. In the
Eastern Mediterranean, Near East and Southeast Asia, this particular climatic event was identified in
North Atlantic marine sediments in the 1990s (Bond et al 2001) and has since then also been related
to large scale social changes (Walker et al 2019, 217). In these particular regions of the world, this
climatic event lasted from 4400 to 3800 BP (c.2300 - 1800 BC) and led to severe droughts in already
arid landscapes and the collapse of, amongst others, the Akkadian Empire (Weiss 2015).
Several archaeologists have also tried to find a relationship between cultural change in Central
Europe and this climatic event, such as the development of the Southern German Early Bronze Age
and the Únětice culture in Central Europe (e.g. papers in Meller et al 2015) or the decreasing human
activity in Thy, northern Denmark (e.g. Andersen 1993). Others have argued against such a view and
see a strong regional differentiation with quite different developments. For instance, Müller (2015)
conducted a study, comparing between North Jutland, the South Cimbrian Peninsula and the Central
German Mittelelbe-Saale-Gebiet. He focused primarily on artefacts and burial evidence. Within this
north-south transect very different influences of the 4.2ka event were postulated on the societal
development (Müller 2015). In order to further this discussion, we will widen the perspective to
other areas in Northwest Europe. This paper will review both the climatic evidence and the
archaeological evidence from several areas in Northwest Europe in order to provide some clarity and
possible answers to the variability in this transition.
As the global environmental phenomenon is recently receiving new attention, aiming at a better
understanding of how past societies have coped with adverse climate change in respect to our

present-day challenge (e.g. Weiss 2016), it becomes more and more compelling to study the varied
social mechanisms and effects from comparative regional scales. Especially the extensive scale of
climatic changes around 2200 BC and the comparability of communities taking part in the Bell
Beaker cultural phenomenon, makes this an excellent potential for studying the various responses to
abrupt climate change in the past.
The climatic changes around 2200 BC have been the centre of several discussions recently beyond
the transformations in prehistoric civilisations. For instance, geologists have proposed the
subdivision of the Holocene epoch into three global stages, the Greenlandian, Northgrippian and the
Meghalayan stages (Cohen et al 2018). Based on global climatic changes observed, these stages
replace the previously informal scheme of Early, Middle and Late Holocene. The change from the
Northgrippian to the Meghalayan stage is taking place during ‘the 4.2ka BP event’, based on
particular changes in temperature and precipitation, as observed in a particular Indian stalagmite
(Walker et al 2019, 216-8).
Similarly, paleo-ecologists have historically identified this period based on shared changes in
vegetation. In Northern Europe, where most of this research has been carried out, this is considered
as the Subboreal. This Subboreal period itself is characterised by a steadily decrease in Ulmus and
Tilia pollen visible in many pollen-diagrams, indicating an opening of primary woodland. While this
decrease is attributed to a combination of both human impact and a long-term change in climate
(Zagwijn 1994, 68), this change often operates on a long time-scale.
It is at the moment however unclear how different regional developments in climatic conditions and
vegetation, such as the developing Subboreal vegetation in Northwest and Central Europe, relate to
the global climatic 4.2ka event, as Walker et al (2019, 214) also states.
In this paper we will test the hypothesis that the climate change described as the ‘4.2ka BP event’
led to or contributed to the end of Bell Beaker phenomenon between 2200-1800 BC. This hypothesis
will be tested by reviewing the climatic evidence from a Northwest European perspective and
reviewing the changes taking place around 2200 BC for regional Bell Beaker communities across
Northwest Europe. We keep in mind that the Bell Beaker phenomenon is a diversified social
construct, which includes dense Bell Beaker style distribution areas as well as areas, in which only a
few Bell Beakers are integrated into the local cultural environments. Therefore, an overview of the
Bell Beaker phenomenon in the various case studies is given as well.
First, some expectations and basic assumptions will be presented, as to the concepts of resilience
and vulnerability and the relationship between climatic and archaeological parameters. After this, an
assessment of the existing climatic evidence will be given for changes taking place at the end of the
3rd millennium BC in Northwest Europe, including marine archives from the Northeast Atlantic.
Subsequently, archaeological evidence for change and continuity, in particular the occupation period
and the abandonment of settlements and changes in subsistence economy, will be discussed.
Methodology and basic assumptions
The study compares archaeological data against a background of regional climate change. By using
the concept of resilience we aim to understand the relationship between society and climate. The
concept of resilience is often used in relation to climate change and responses in both natural (e.g.
Willemse/Groenewoudt 2012) and societal (e.g. Dockrill/Bond 2009; Flohr et al 2016) aspects.
Resilience is here defined as the capacity of societies to withdraw adverse climate change and its
environmental impacts. Our ability to see resilience is dependant on the way we envisage the
relationship between climate and society.
A recent paper by Flohr et al (2016) reviews three different ways environmental crises can impact
society: the general collapse of society, the triggering of long-distance migrations combined with the
local adaptation towards a new reality, and finally environmental crises can leave no impact on

human societies. Settlement activities, subsistence strategies and demographic change are the main
sources for understanding the impact of climatic change and the societal aspects of resilience
towards this climatic change. In particular for the early farming communities in Western Asia,
changes in agricultural produce and settlement activities can be related to a decrease in
precipitation around the 9.2ka, the 8.2ka and 4.2-3.9ka periods (Flohr et al 2016; Weiss 2016).
What we can take from this, is that we can focus our analysis on both settlement activities and
subsistence strategies. We must however consider these aspects with a particular regard to our
Northwest European case studies and the way these parameters relate to both climate change itself
and the resilience of communities in adapting to this climate change during the later 3rd millennium
BC.
We study settlement activities by looking at the occupation history of settlements throughout the
3rd millennium BC, noting the start and ending of settlements and the ways in which settlement
practices and traditions are continued, changed or halted. If occupation ends or an abrupt halt in
settlement practices is visible around 2200 BC, we can argue for a correlation with climatic change.
Less dramatic changes, building on traditional practices, can be seen as evidence for resilience. The
precise timing of the changes in settlement activities, in order to perfectly correlate with climatic
data, will be impossible. The archaeological / socio-environmental methodology uses Bayesian
modelled radiocarbon dates (see Bayliss et al 2007 and Bronk Ramsey 2009), pottery
typochronology, and direct evidence from, for instance, the changes in sedimentation and soil
formation or erosion.
Subsistence strategies are studied by comparing the records for botanical and zoological datasets
from archaeological excavations, complemented with evidence such as pottery residues and
foodcrusts, cattle hoofprints, ploughmarks, palynological evidence and particular finds associated
with subsistence, such as fish traps, flint sickles or storage containers. Particularly important in
identifying resilience to climate change are the variability in animal and plant species consumed, and
the introduction of new animal and plant species within the human diet. Both will be assessed for
their chronological relevance based on the phasing of settlements mentioned above. Not all these
types of evidence are present within each study area.
When changes in settlement activities and subsistence strategies are not associated with climate
change, or when no changes are observed in settlement activities or subsistence strategies, the
hypothesis stated in the previous paragraph (“the climate change described as the 4.2ka BP event
led to the end of Bell Beaker associated settlement occupation and subsistence strategies between
2200-1800 BC”) must be rejected, and alternatively we can state that communities were resilient in
adapting to climate change.
The methods of this study involve an analysis of settlement occupation patterns and subsistence
strategies from three areas of Northern Europe during the period between 2500 and 2000 BC: the
Orkney Islands (in the United Kingdom), the Low Countries (comprising of the Netherlands and
Flanders) and Schleswig-Holstein (in Germany) in Northwest Europe (fig. 1).

Climatic changes in NW Europe around 4200 BP
Having explained our premises for this study, and the concept of resilience that relates society and
archaeological data to climate change, we will now turn to the climatic change itself. For
understanding climate change in Northwest Europe around 4200 BP, the most suitable records are
found in the marine archives of the North Atlantic Ocean. Marine archives are well suited to
complement continental ones, because they can provide quantitative and continuous
reconstructions of temperature and precipitation changes, thus enabling to assess the magnitude
and rate of changes as compared to a wider regional setting. Moreover these records help to
discriminate the signals of climate change and human impact inherent to Continental lacustrine or
peat-derived climate archives.
Jalali et al (2019) provides a recent overview of some of the North Atlantic marine records with the
highest temporal resolution and data quality. These records show changes in Sea Surface
Temperature, which in turn drive (and can thus be used as records of) two major atmospheric
formations in the North Atlantic, the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and the Subpolar Gyre. Due to
the mechanism of orbital forcing (Wanner et al 2008), the NAO is already showing a cooling trend
from 5300 BP onwards. This also leads to a reduction of activity in the Subpolar Gyre circulation, as
Jalali et al (2019) suggest, and a cold and slightly dryer climate in Northwest Europe. Quantitatively,
a 2 degrees Celsius decrease in summer-SST and a minor decrease in humidity is argued for, during
the period between 4400 and 4100 BP (Jalali et al 2019, 3). Butruille et al (2017) see a similar
decrease in both in summer and winter temperature between 4200 and 3500 BP, based on the
analysis of two marine sediment corings from the Skagerrak.

On the Continent, some records show evidence for a change in climate, albeit less unequivocal,
perhaps reflecting an increased climatic variability. At Lake Bliden in Denmark, Olsen et al (2010)
record a humidity shift, within their zone 1 based on their analysis of oxygen, sulphur, carbon and
nitrogen isotopes of a sediment core. Between 4300-4050 BP, a decrease in oxygen values points to
a wet period. However an increase in nitrogen and sulphur values is indicative of drier and warmer
summers, and/or colder winters (Olsen et al 2010, 338). Vorren et al (2007), studying the
Sellevollmyra bog in Arctic Norway identified a climatic deterioration with lower temperatures, but
moister conditions (a ‘wet shift’), between 4220-3810 years BP, primarily based on the study of
pollen. And finally, at Engbertsdijksvenen, several cores hint at climatic changes. In cores ENG-I (Van
Geel 1978, 18), phase J (48-56 cm) shows the predominance of Molinia coerulea, coinciding with a
decline in Ulmus and Tilia and charcoal. This phase J is also found in core ENG-II, and here dated
more clearly to around 2200 BC. This particular vegetation change is interpreted as the result of
drier conditions and a natural fire around 4200 BP (Van Geel/Dallmeijer 1986, 476-7). Due to the
changes in peat ecology as a result of the fire, the particular species Molinia coerulea dominates for
a few centuries in a seasonal varied wet and dry landscape, until a Sphagnum peat develops around
3900 BP. Core XVI (Blaauw 2003, 58-9) however shows a hiatus between 4200-2500 cal BC, possible
as a consequence of this fire, burning away the older peat archive. For Schleswig-Holstein different
laminated sediment and pollen records, for example from Lake Belau, indicate long winters and a
short vegetation phase between 4050 and 4010 BC, but no major event around 2200 BC (Dreibrodt
et al 2012).
An important marker enabling to interconnect terrestrial and marine climate archives, is the Hekla-4
eruption (magnitude of VEI:6). This eruption led to an ash cloud fallout with a global amount of 60x
106 tons (H2SO4 + HX), mostly over Northwest Europe during 23rd/22nd century BC
(Larsen/Þórarinsson 1977; Hammer et al 1980; Davies et al 2010, 609, fig. 4). As this kind of
eruptions are likely to have acted on much shorter timescales, these would not be recorded in
climate curves. No notably effects on climate are reported for the time under consideration (e.g.
Caseldine et al 1998).
Other effects of this volcanic eruption might have played a more significant role however, for the
prehistoric communities of Northwest Europe. Volcanic ash rains consist mainly of the acidic
element of sulphur. As Iceland was uninhabited during prehistory, and separated from the Continent
by a large mass of water, most of this acidic sulphur would have ended up here. Acidity might have
influenced the natural acidity threshold of already sensitive soils, such as the mountainous soils in
Scotland. When critical sulphur loads in soils exceed the natural threshold, this hampers the growing
of vegetation (Grattan/Gilbertson 2000). This might have indirectly influenced the possibilities of
growing crops, in particular on acidic soils, and have led to harvest failures or induced changing crop
cultivation regimes.
Concluding, we have shown that climate change commonly described as ‘the 4.2ka BP event’ also
took place in the Northern latitudes around the Atlantic. The effects were a mean 2 degrees Celsius
drop in both summer and winter temperatures and a possible decrease in humidity on the
Continent, between 2200 and 1800 BC.

The Bell Beaker phenomenon in Northwest Europe
Here, a short overview of the Bell Beaker phenomenon as a cultural entity in these three case
studies is given. In all these study areas, the Bell Beaker phenomenon shows very particular regional
traits, that have often been dismissed as either ‘no Bell Beaker presence’ or ‘local i itation’ (see
Vander Linden 2006). In the subsequent paragraphs the specific archaeological evidence for
settlement activity and subsistence economy will be reviewed for the period under consideration
here. Subsequently the review will move from West to East: the Orkney Islands, the Low Countries
and Schleswig-Holstein.

On the Orkney Islands, the Bell Beaker phenomenon, as it is known from other parts of Europe, is
almost non-existent. The ubiquitous and well-known large stone settlements and megalithic
funerary monuments such as chambered cairns and stone circles all predate 2400 BC. No funerary
monuments are known from the time period dating between 2400 and 2000 BC, and the material
culture that can be determined as “Bell Bea er” has been found only in limited quantities.
Additionally, these sherds and vessels have been centre of debate, because of their lack of distinct
Bell Beaker characteristics. Instead these vessels, although having spatula impressed geometric
decoration, are more thick-walled, barrel-shaped and decorated in a less strict fashion (see Clarke et
al 2016, 61, Illus. 3). Similarly, Gibson (1984, 80) sees a particular vessel as having a ‘degenerate’
shape. Several metal and flint objects and graves can be dated between 2100-1700 BC, such as the
famous Knowes of Trotty burial (Sheridan et al 2003), a flint dagger (Frieman 2014) and two specific
bronze daggers (Gerloff 1975:77 and 120), indicating the existence of exchange networks, but
restricted to the British Isles.
In the Low Countries, the Bell Beaker phenomenon is primarily known from the funerary record (e.g.
Lanting/Van Der Waals 1976), with the typical “Bell Beaker graves”, occurring under barrows in the
sandy landscapes of Central and Eastern Netherlands, equipped with typical Bell Beaker style
artefacts such as wristguards, copper daggers, flint arrowheads and pottery. This particular
distribution corresponds to the preceding Corded Ware phenomenon (Fokkens 2012). These kinds of
graves are common, especially in Central Europe (see for instance Grossmann 2016). Specifically Bell
Beaker pottery shows a continuous development into the regional Veluwe-style and the heavily
decorated Potbeker vessels, concurring with the development of thick-walled and loosely decorated
Common Ware (Kleijne 2019). From c. 2100 BC onwards, developments in metallurgy (both in
artefacts produced and their composition) and pottery show a change in exchange networks taking
place. In the Western Netherlands likewise a continuation of Vlaardingen and Corded Ware
settlements and more abnormal funerary practices can be seen.
In Schleswig-Holstein, the Bell Beaker phenomenon also follows on the Corded Ware phenomenon.
This preceding phenomenon is clearly present here in single grave burials (Hübner 2005), particular
stone axe hammers (Schultrich 2019) and several settlements (Brozio et al 2019). However, only
several graves are known containing Bell Beaker artefacts (mainly pottery, wristguards and
arrowheads). The pottery is well-produced, having thin walls, S-shapes and well-executed spatula
impressed decoration, primarily in zoned motifs or bands (Struve 1955). A large number of burials,
known as ‘dagger graves’, is associated with flint daggers and sometimes undecorated pottery.
These graves are tentatively dated between 2350 and 1900 BC (Kuhn 1979; Vandkilde 1996) and
occur throughout Schleswig-Holstein, and into Denmark (Sarauw 2007) and MecklenburgVorpommern (e.g. Forler 2006). The daggers accompanying these graves are exchanged all across
Northern (Apel 2001), Central (Siemann 2003) and Western Europe, between the Low Countries
(Drenth 2015) and Belarus (Czebreszuk/Kryvaltsevich 2003), however they are found here in low
quantities and primarily not in burial contexts.

Figure 2. All the mentioned sites on the Orkney Islands
Situated in the far North of the British Isles, human occupation on the Orkney Islands shows
important developments during the 3rd millennium BC. During the earlier 3rd millennium BC, large
stone walled nucleated settlements such as Skara Brae, Ness of Brodgar and Barnhouse (associated
with Grooved Ware pottery), are being occupied intermittently during the first half of this
millennium, until c. 2400 BC (cf. Bayliss et al 2017, 1182, fig. 5). At Late Neolithic sites in the Orkney
Islands, various sources of evidence points that “…there was economic stability between the early
and late Neolithic in this area, with no significant exploitation of wild terrestrial or marine fauna in
either period…” (Bishop 2015, 844).
Only for two of these stone walled settlements, occupation lasts beyond the middle of the 3rd
millennium BC: at Tofts Ness on Sanday and at Links of Noltland on Westray. At the latter, large
stone houses are abandoned with a spectacular deer heap deposition, but some evidence for
occupation exists. In trench C, a cultivation soil developed on top of a stone wall, producing some
Bell Beaker pottery (Clarke et al 2016, 60-61). Trench D also uncovered a wall in a phase postdating
the spectacular Late Neolithic settlement abandonment, preceded with evidence for ard and spade
cultivation and the removal of wall stones (phase VII and VIII; Clarke et al 2016, illus. 5), signalling a
renewed activity in this landscape during the Bell Beaker phase. Plant remains and animal bones
have not been published yet.
At Tofts Ness, on mound 11, settlement evidence consists of a stone roundhouse structure, covered
by a settlement mound and various cultural layers. Late Neolithic occupation is present in the form
of a midden sequence, covered by windblown sand. Habitation on this site continues into the Early
Bronze Age. The Late Neolithic midden sequence, phase 2 of the site, produced cultural remains of
both stone tools and pottery. The absence of Grooved Ware, so common on other settlements on
the Or ney’s, is remarkable. Instead, pottery decoration points towards maritime exchange
networks with communities on Shetland (Dockrill 2007, 381). Plant remains here show a
predominance of naked barley (Hordeum vulgare var. Nudum), cultivated in a garden-like fashion,

using manuring (Dockrill/Bond 2009, 35). The animal remains from Tofts Ness show that subsistence
economy was not solely based on cereal cultivation and animal husbandry however. While domestic
cattle and sheep predominate the spectrum of land-based animals, the number of bird and fish
remains indicate an important role for the fowling of various species of birds and marine fishing,
primarily on large cod and ling (Dockrill/Bond 2009). It is clear that this settlement can be
characterised by a flexible subsistence economy.
Palynological evidence on the Orkney Islands generally shows a predominantly open and treeless
landscape, dominated by herbaceous vegetation. This landscape has developed since the first
opening of the woodland during the earlier Neolithic and continues throughout the 3rd millennium
BC. This is apparent from both on-site investigations (see Davidson/Jones 1985, 26-27) and from
several recent peat cores (e.g. Farrell 2015). At the peat bog of Glims Moss however
(Keatinge/Dickinson 1979, fig. 2-3), a minor spike in tree-pollen is visible around 420-445cm depth.
Six radiocarbon dates were taken from bulk peat samples at this site. When we remodel the
radiocarbon chronology for this core, this particular minor spike can be dated around 2200 BC.1 This
spike is associated with a rise in woodland taxa (Betula, Pinus, Quercus, Alnus, Fraxinus and Corylus)
and a presence of plantain (Plantago lanceolata). This can tentatively be seen as a minor woodland
regeneration, alongside the continued indications for human disturbance and open grazing pastures.
This provides a good indication of the changing landscape around 2200 BC, with a decrease in
human activity and a change in subsistence economy. This decrease in human activity was previously
dated from 2000 BC onwards (Davidson/Jones 1985) When quantifying the monument building and
its special distribution, domestic patterns and comparing these results to palaeoecological evidence,
Müller (1990) already stated that around 2300 BCE a steep decrease in economic and cultural
activities took place. Bunting et al (2018) recently modelled the vegetation development during the
Neolithic on the Orkney Islands, and they state that no changes in land-cover are visible that might
be explained by climate change or abandonment associated with the final occupation of the stone
walled settlements around 2300 BC. They suggest a continuity of land-use instead (Bunting et al
2018, 11). What is however visible in their curves around the end of the 3rd millennium BC is a minor
increase in the proportion of land area covered by pine-oak trees, both in lowland and upland
landscapes (Bunting et al 2018, figure 4B and 4C) and some regional varying developments (Bunting
et al 2018, figure 3) that might be more indicative of a decrease in human activity or changing landuse practices.

Figure 5. All the mentioned sites in the Low Countries
Bell Beaker settlements in the Low Countries are known primarily from the Western Netherlands
(see Kleijne/Drenth 2019, fig. 1). Houses consist of rectangular wooden structures, with central posts
and wall posts often preserved. These house plans show a continuous development from the earlier
3rd millennium BC onwards. Two-aisled plans, such as at Vlaardingen (phase 2) date between c.
2600-2200 BC. Such simple types of houses continue to be built at Carnisselande (phase 3), between
c. 2200-2000 BC, and change only slightly with the addition of an extra internal structure (possibly
connected to storage facilities) and double wall-posts at for instance Molenaarsgraaf (phase 1) and a
move towards a (wider) three-aisled ground plan at Heiloo (phase 1) and Noordwijk (phase 1;

Kleijne/Drenth 2019). Excavations often only reveal a single house plan or two house plans that are
not contemporaneous but probably subsequent. Settlements themselves seem to have been
occupied for only one generation making any assessment of increasing or decreasing settlement
intensity difficult. The ceramics found on these settlements show a similar continuity with the
development of Common Ware vessel types such as potbekers and Riesenbecher and the slow
introduction of Barbed Wire decorated vessels (Kleijne 2019). These various kinds of pottery are
both known from settlements, as sherds, or as complete vessels from carefully placed deposits. In
the Low Countries, the number of potbeker and Riesenbecher vessels from funerary contexts is
relatively low (Kleijne 2019, 158-161).

The subsistence economy of Late Neolithic communities in the Low Countries is primarily based on
arable farming and animal husbandry, based on cattle and sheep (Clason 1999), but gathering and
fishing, and the hunting and fowling of wild animals continues to be of importance (see also Fokkens
et al 2016). At the site of J97, a large number of fish weirs and fish traps were found dating to the
later 3rd millennium BC (Bulten et al 2009) and at Molenaarsgraaf a burial contained both a Bell
Beaker vessel and a number of fish remains, fish hooks and possibly an antler-shaped fishing rod
(Louwe Kooijmans 1974). Fish remains at settlements such as for instance Carnisselande show that it
formed an integral part of the subsistence economy (Moree et al 2010), continuing well into the
Bronze Age (Van Amerongen 2015).
A review and aoristic analysis of all the arable fields during the 4th and 3rd millennium BC throughout
Northwest Europe, shows an increase in frequency after 2200 BC after a decrease during the
preceding centuries for the Low Countries, Denmark and Northern Germany (see fig. 7). Examples of
this in the Low Countries are the large plots of arable land at Velsen Westlaan 2 (Therkorn 2008;
Kleijne 2015), Oostwoud (Fokkens et al 2017, see fig. 4) and Noorderboekert (Knippenberg 2018). At
these locations extensive tracts of arable land often consist of multiple phased criss-crossed
ploughmarks. These sites are often situated in dynamic coastal landscapes, well-suited for cereal
cultivation. On the less fertile sandy soils, a more pastoral economy is envisaged based on the
continued openness of cultural landscapes and the maintenance of heathland, as visible in pollendiagrams (Doorenbosch 2013, 233-234).

Settlement activity in Schleswig-Holstein during the later 3rd millennium BC is characterised by small
scale single farmsteads. Early Corded Ware settlements, where occupation ends around 2600 BC,
have been found for instance at Oldenburg LA 232 (Brozio et al 2018), but only settlement scatters
are nown fro
etween 6 and
BC. Also, total quantities of aterial culture shows a ‘ ust’
during this period, followed y a ‘ oo ’ around
BC (Müller
5; Feeser et al 2019). Around

2000 BC new indications for permanent occupation are known from Flintbek LA20, Archsum LA65
Melenknop (Wirth 1994; Zich 2000), Schoolbek and Harrislee. In many instances, material culture or
other kinds of dating evidence are lacking however (Ethelberg et al 2000, 165-172). These houses
continue to show a simple two-aisled plan throughout the 3rd millennium BC, just as the earlier
house plans in Oldenburg LA 232, without any modifications or internal structuring. Similarly to
many regions of the North Central European Plain, a particular type of large storage vessel, the
Riesenbecher, develops around 2200 BC (Hartz/Müller 2018), here however more often found in
structured depositions and in graves.
Between 2600 and 2200 BC, a decrease in settlements and subsistence intensity is also visible from
palynological evidence for human impact (Feeser et al 2012). From c. 2200 BC onwards, subsistence
activities can be characterised as an intensified mixed farming economy (Brozio et al 2019; Kirleis
2019). This is similarly visible in the weighted aoristic analysis carried out (see fig x). At both Flintbek
LA20 and Archsum LA65 Melenknop, a cultivation soil with ploughmarks developed during the
occupation between 2200-2000 BC. More ploughmarks in Schleswig-Holstein are known from the
period between 2000-1700 BC, often found below Early Bronze Age burial monuments (e.g.
Tegtmeier 1993). Mixed cereal cultivation on these arable fields was practiced of both Hordeum
vulgare and Triticum dicoccum. Large quantities of both cereals and chaff remains were found in a
pit at Bosau (Kroll 1980; Kirleis et al 2012), and also the human impact seems to have increased
(Feeser et al 2019). This economic intensification and population increase can be associated with the
development of new exchange networks, investing in the highly skilled production and the exchange
of flint daggers (Brozio et al 2019).
An important exception to this model of intensification of the agricultural economy, is the
settlement site of Quern-Neukirchen “Tegel arg”. This settlement developed between 2200 and
1900 BC, and is characterised as a shell-midden (Arnold 1981; Hartz/Müller 2018). This site is
characterised by an up to 40 cm thick layer of occupation debris, flint artefact production waste,
hearths and mussel shells. Found within this midden are the remains of gathered wild plants and
fruits (Schaller/Kirleis 2018), both wild and domestic animals and a large number of thrown away
shells of mussel (Mytilus edulis) and cockle (Cerastoderma edule). Fish remains are notably absent
(although no sieving was carried out; Höfgen 2018). It is unclear if the shell-midden was a seasonal
camp or continuously occupied and how these activities relate to the late Neolithic arable farming
and husbandry economy. Similar shell middens dating to the 3rd millennium BC are known from
Denmark (Andersen 2007) and the Netherlands (e.g. Kleijne et al 2013) and might fit into a broader
pattern of continued reliance on wild and marine food sources.

Discussion
At the start of this paper the question was posed regarding the resilience and vulnerability of Bell
Beaker communities in Northwest Europe around the 4.2ka BP climatic event. In the above we have
reviewed both the climatic data specifically for Northwest Europe and the archaeological data
concerning occupation patterns and subsistence economy of Bell Beaker communities in the Orkney
Islands, the Low Countries and Schleswig-Holstein.
With regard to occupation patterns, the Orkney Islands shows a clear decrease in settlement activity
after 2300 BC. No complete abandonment seems to have taken place, but a decrease in settlement
intensity is likely. A shift from stone house agglomerations towards a less intensive settlement
system, represented only by the accumulation of household waste in cultural layers, is recognisable.
Continuity in occupation is attested for the settlement of Tofts Ness, north in the Or ney’s, which is
also showing exchange networks with the continuous habitation on Shetland (Sheridan 2013). We
argue that this decrease in settlement intensity is not merely a product of archaeological visibility
but also a decrease in population numbers. This population decrease did not lead to a total
abandonment, but a reorganisation in terms of subsistence, a decrease in strength of exchange

networks and a more flexible economical system for the remaining inhabitants. Subsistence
economy on the Orkney Islands changed from a strong focus on cereal cultivation and animal
husbandry, towards a more flexible economy including the hunting of wild and marine animals and
possibly pastoralism. Dockrill and Bond (2009) demonstrate that for the Tofts Ness settlement,
resilience played a role in the Late Neolithic subsistence activities, with the flexibility of resources
and the continued existence of exchange networks after 2200 BC.
In the Low Countries, settlement activity shows a continuity in terms of practices and the built
structures (see also Kleijne/Drenth 2019). The two-aisled house plan is continuously built
throughout the 3rd millennium BC, with double wall posts and inner compartments added after 2200
BC. Subsistence economy is primarily agricultural, as indicated by numerous arable fields with
ploughmarks known from coastal wetland landscapes, but fishing and hunting still played an
important role (see also Fokkens et al 2016).
Settlement activity in Schleswig-Holstein increased around 2200 BC (after a long period of decline
during the after 2600 BC, during the late Corded Ware and early Bell Beaker period) with several
house plans known. Also, the agricultural economy intensified after 2200 BC, as demonstrated by
the numerous plough-marks below round barrow mounds. A new regional exchange network, based
on flint daggers, linked these communities to the wider world. The flexibility of the subsistence
economy can be demonstrated by the shell midden of Tegelbarg, dating between 2100-1900 BC.
The presence of ard marks in large numbers in both Schleswig-Holstein and the Low Countries after
2200 BC might indicate that cereal cultivation was not negatively affected by the climatic changes.
Maybe even the 4.2ka event, and the associated 2C drop in temperature, had a positive effect on
the possibility of agriculture in these areas. A similar pattern, of Bell Beaker occupation and arable
fields primarily dating after 2200 BC, can be seen in the Scottish Western Isles (Sharples 2009, 2015).
We can thus agree to Müller (
5)’s argu ents for regional varia ility in the changes occurring
around 2200 BC.
While the decrease in temperature is minor in absolute terms, its relative impact can only be
assessed when compared to the preceding climatic conditions. The period preceding the 4.2ka
event, is generally considered to be final part of the so-called Holocene Climatic Optimum, during
which temperatures were several degrees warmer than present day. Exemplary are also the finds of,
for instance, a pond tortoise (Emys orbicularis L.) nowadays only encountered in the Mediterranean,
at the Dutch Late Neolithic settlement of Vlaardingen (Van Wijngaarden-Bakker 1996), or of a
greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus ruber) at the Late Neolithic site of Kolhorn (Zeiler/Clason 1993,
69), both predating the 4.2ka event and the Bell Beaker phenomenon.
It is not known how much the large variety of agricultural activities (clearance, ploughing/tilling,
manuring, sowing, harvesting, fallow and crop rotation; see Lewis 2012) changed during this time as
an (indirect) consequence of the climatic deterioration after the mid-Holocene optimum and the
4.2ka event.

Conclusion
The 4.2ka event, generally dated between 2200 and 1800 BC, appears to have had a different impact
on the regional climate in Northwest Europe, compared to for instance the Iberian Peninsula or the
Near East. In terms of both temperature and humidity, and in terms of the effects on vegetation, a
regional variability is visible. This regional variability indicates that no widespread collapse of
settlement and subsistence economies associated with the Bell Beaker phenomenon is visible.
Especially for communities in Continental Northwest Europe, settlement activity continued,
agricultural practices developed and new exchange networks were initiated. Economic

diversification, by hunting and fishing and the gathering of shellfish, provided the necessary
flexibility of possibly more variable weather conditions.
The changes around 2200 BC in Continental Northwest Europe are thus mainly cultural, related to
new exchange networks, the introduction of new materials such as bronze and objects such as
Riesenbecher (perhaps to facilitate storage and the accumulation of prestige, see Hartz/Müller
2017).
