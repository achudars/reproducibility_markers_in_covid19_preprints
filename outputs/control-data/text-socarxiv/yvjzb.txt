Abstract
This paper analyzes how topic shifts are performed and perceived in conversations. It investigates
the way topic shifts are constructed and sequenced in Saudi female conversations, focusing on the
structure of topic shifts along with their discourse markers. It also aims at highlighting the way
these topic shifts are observed by participants. This paper is a case study that tries to understand
the performance of topic shifts in a recorded conversation with emphasis on the construction,
markers and sequences of topics, adding empirical evidence to the overall knowledge related to
this issue. It also studies perceptions of Saudi women on topic shifting. Two instruments were
used: data recording and analysis, and a four-axis questionnaire. Gathered data was analyzed using
interactional sociolinguistics analysis and statistics to arrive at results. The findings of the study
indicate that the most frequent shifts of topics occurred after a pause where speakers introduced a
new topic. These shifts were performed by using discourse markers such as asking questions,
seeking explanations, or telling personal stories. Topic shifts might be violated in informal settings
based on relations between participants. Questionnaire results conclude that topic shifts are
performed in relation to interest, and motivated by closeness and need. It is recommended that
further investigation is carried out considering different social variables and domains of
interaction.

1- Introduction:
Topic shifts are certain phases of a conversation that indicate transitions from one discourse chunk
that has a coherent topic or content to another chunk with another coherent topic or content. They
occur in the conversation where one topic is covered and discussed and another topic needs to be
introduced. Women interact on a cooperative basis in all-inclusive female interaction, showing
significant differences from mixed or all-male interaction (Coates, 2004; Tannen, 2007).
Interactional sociolinguistics analysis is an approach that is used to study language in use by
specifying recurrent patterns and practices that are performed during social interaction. This
approach studies conversational aspects related to discourse like turn-taking, turn-design, repair,
questions, topic shifting and other aspects of interaction, revealing the dynamics of the discourse
(Schiffrin, 1994; Clark, 2007). Interactional sociolinguistics analysis is adopted in this paper to
investigate and highlight the performance of topic shifting by Saudi women in order to understand
the construction, markers, and sequences of these instances. This paper aims at investigating the
topic shifts that occur in natural speech between female participants where more than one topic is
introduced. It focuses on the way these shifts are performed and perceived by participants. It
investigates various explanations for differences that occur in the way these topics were
introduced, and how women perceived them. It also tries to answer questions related to when and
where shifts take place, how are they performed and why do they occur using two methods of data
collection. This paper goes in line with other research conducted in this area, and it also
investigates otherwise.
2- The Notion of Topic Shifting from a Theoretical Perspective:
In the structure of a conversation, there are points where one topic is concluded and another
is introduced as a transitional phase that has its own unique and complex structure. The notion of
“topic” is a problematic notion with a number of different suggested definitions (Blei et al, 2003;
Kellermann, 2004). According to Chafe (2008), "A topic is defined as a coherent organization of
thoughts introduced by a participant in a conversation and developed either by that participant or
another or by several participants together" (p.674). In this perspective, a topic can be thought of
as a coherent unit that is large enough to embed sequences contributing to the same idea. Topics
introduce an issue in which all that is said must be relevant to that particular issue. Topics usually
have a clear beginning, but their endings may be well defined or may not. Yet, there are phonetic
cues that signal shifts such as a pause, a heightened pitch, loudness or a new voice quality
(Schiffrin, (ed.), 2008). A topic has a pattern or a schema providing a path for participants to
follow. As long as the topic is open, participants a free to develop it, dwell on it or terminate it
(Hatch, 2000). People are usually constrained to fully develop the topic before the conversation
moves to another topic. There are lots of techniques proposed by scholars trying to divide a stretch
of talk into smaller, topically coherent segments (Purver, 2011). Yet, topic segmentation and
division is still an open research problem. Some methods of topic analysis and topic segmentation
focus more on content, ignoring speakers’ identities, including gender. So, topics can be identified
based on their content.
Topic as a notion is related to discourse in which a topic is a unifying concept that makes
one stretch of discourse about something and the next stretch about something else (Brown & Yule
2007). Participants pick up elements from the contribution of a preceding speaker and introduce
them in their contribution in a dynamic and negotiated way. A topic shift occurs between two

chunks of discourse, or two different topics. This shift takes place at a marked point in the
conversation. If these markers or boundaries of shifts are identified, the discourse can be divided
into units. In spoken discourse, there are structural units of discourse that take the form of speech
paragraph called paratones marked by intonational cues (Brown & Yule, 2007). Introductory
expressions are used to announce the beginning of a topic in a raising pitch to signal this shift.
Participants need to pick up on these signals and response upon. The end of a topic is signaled with
a low pitch, a lengthy pause or a repetition of the introductory statement indicating that
contributions are not accepted and a shift is about to be made to another topic (Hatch, 2000). All
of these proposed signals are optional since actual interaction may take different expected or
unexpected reactions. Any native speaker of a language learns these rules through socialization
and interaction in which cooperation is based on this shared knowledge among participants
(Johnstone, 2003; Gumperz, 1982). Topic shifts are usually established around relationships
between conversational participants (Ireland et al, 2011). Participants having closer relations
would tend to have a more relaxed circulation and change of topics. Women are more known to
adopt a cooperative style of talk that is supportive in nature. This gender-specific style can be
featured by positive violations to the structured frame of topic change suggested by scholars
(Schiffrin, 1994). Kaoru Amino (2009) investigated women's style shifting of turn-taking (TT)
strategies in mixed-gender conversation in the Japanese society, exploring the different (TT)
strategies conducted by both men and women and whether women's TT strategy choice is
influenced by the interlocutor's gender. The results illustrate that the senior female participants
frequently used (TT) strategies that reflected supportive traits such as the promotion of
conversations in mixed-gender conversations.
One of the most common ways to capture conversational structure in naturally occurring
data is topic division and segmentation of long recordings or transcripts into shorter, topically
coherent segments (Purver, 2011). The two main approaches used to study conversational structure
center around either focusing on discourse markers, or studying word distribution. The first
approach focuses on identifying discourse markers, which draw boundaries between different
topics in the conversations. There are certain cue phrases such as, “well, now, that reminds me,
etc.” that explicitly indicate the end of one topic, or initiate the beginning of another (Hirschberg
& Litman, 1993; Passonneau & Litman, 1997). The second approach focuses on lexical cohesion
that divides a stretch of talk into topics (Halliday & Hasan, 1976). In this method, words within a
segment or a topic look more like their neighbors than like words in other segments or topics.
Morris and Hirst (1991) worked on defining the structure of any given text by finding what they
call “lexical chains”, which consist of units of text that are related to the same theme. In this paper,
the first approach is adopted because it gives more insight into the relations between participants,
and focuses more on the transformational phase between topics.
3- Methodology:
In this empirical study, both the qualitative and quantitative approaches were implemented.
Interactional sociolinguistics analysis is a qualitative method that is concerned with the structure
and the pattern of natural conversations between speakers, paying more attention to the relations
between participants and their influence on the structural aspect of interaction.

3-1- The Data of the Study:
The data of the study was taken from a recorded conversation between four female
participants in an informal setting. The conversation took place in a café between female friends
having their coffee and discussing a number of topics. The conversation was recorded on the 3 rd
of November, 2017. The length of this conversation is around 21 minutes. The method that was
followed was the observer-participant method where the researcher was present at time of this
conversation. Each participant is given a code (P1, P2, P3, P4). The conversation was taperecorded by the researcher where the conversation along with the occurrences of topic shifts were
transcribed and analyzed. The participants were close friends sharing similar interests and
belonging to the same university environment.
The statistical data was gathered through conducting a questionnaire distributed on female
participants. All participants were female college students. The total number of distributed
questionnaires was 91, and the turned-on questionnaires that were completely answered were 80.
They were collected in February 2018. The results were further analyzed using statistical analysis
tools, and presented in diagrams and tables in later sections.
3-2- Data Analysis:
The recorded data was analyzed following the interactional sociolinguistics analysis. This
approach is based on the work of Gumperz and Goffman in which they view language as a socially
and culturally constructed configuration, reflecting and creating macro-level social meaning and
micro-level interpersonal meaning (Schiffrin, 1994). This can be achieved through the analysis of
contextualization cues, alignments, identities of speakers and the participation framework that
includes different roles participants can play in an event (Schiffrin, 1994; Holmes, 2013). The
recorded conversation was analyzed using this approach to highlight and investigate the effect of
gender and interpersonal relations on the construction of topic shifts, and the way participants
would follow or hence violate the structural rules proposed by scholars. Instances of topic shifts
were transcribed and analyzed. Extracts were originally in Arabic (the native language of
participants), and they were later translated to English. The Arabic transcribed formats were
presented along with their translations.
The quantitative aspect of this paper deals with answering questions related to participants’
perspectives on when and where women perform topic shifts, why they shift topics, topic choice
and how these shifts are performed though using a questionnaire. This instrument was designed
based on theoretical motivations and topic-change cues proposed by scholars. The questionnaire
is divided into four parts each of which asks a different question (when does topic change take
place, motivations of a topic change, topic choice, and how topics are changed?). Under each part,
a number of statements were presented on an agreement scale. Data was analyzed using SPSS,
calculating the mean and the rank of participants’ responses to each item. The results were
summarized in tables. The unit of analysis that is investigated in this paper by using these two
methods of research is the unit of topic shift that occurs at certain points in the conversation
affecting the pattern and the sequence of this conversation. It further focuses on the linguistic cues
or markers that signal the beginning and the ending of topics.

4- The Topic Shifts in the Recorded Conversation:
In this recorded conversation, a number of topic shifts have occurred. This conversation
shows an approximate number of 15 occurrences of shifts between different topics. Interactive
topic development may be driven by a speaker’s desire to agree, contradict with others, request
information, or elaborate. Topic and response analysis is related to interaction since it is hard to
discover the intentions of interlocutors without interaction (Shiffern, 2008; Ballard, 2007).
Through analysis, topic-response strategies can be understood. The responses speakers provide to
the topic reflect their relationships with each other. Maynard (1980) notes that topic changes often
occur “as a solution to failed speaker transitions” (p. 264). That is, the circulated topic comes to
an end with no contributions are to be provided, speakers then are likely to ensure the circulation
of a talk by introducing a new topic. Okamoto and Smith-Lovin (2001) also noted that pauses and
short utterances are speech markers that increase the chance that the next speaker will change the
topic. It is also important to identify who controls the topic according to a participation framework
based on the influence of power position, symmetrical relations, age, and gender factors (Okamoto
& Smith-Lovin, 2001). The right of a participant to change the topic is limited in which this act of
topic shifting has to be signaled and accepted by others. The conversation is analyzed at a point
where the previous topic had just been closed and the conversation is to be continued where
someone has to choose and introduce a new topic.
Shifts of topics that occurred in the data have different forms and interpretations. They follow
some general rules that allow for a topic to be shifted. These shifts were developed to communicate
and cooperate by trying to give details or share related stories about the topic being discussed. It
can be considered as a collaborative topic building that reflects solidarity. Telling personal stories
and asking overlapping questions are considered high involvement strategies (Wardough, 2010;
Holmes, 2013). One instance of a topic shift in the data occurred at a point in which one topic was
concluded and no more contributions were developed. It took place after a pause that lasted for six
seconds without suggesting a new topic. (P1) at that point has decided to communicate and
introduced a new topic related to the vacation asking about the annual schedule of holidays. The
conversation took place according to the following sequence of turns:
Extract -1Pause 6 seconds:
1-P1: now how much we still have + two weeks for the vacation or three?
(halheen kam lessa bagi + esbou’een ala alejaza wella thalatha?)
2-P2: no three + I don't know if its three + but I don't know if its with counting this
week or not (la thalatha + ma adri whu thalathah + bas ma adri ma’a hatha
alesboua’ wella la’)
In extract -1- of the conversation, a topic shift took place where one participant was trying
to communicate and proceed with the communicative event after a relatively long pause. P1 has
initiated the new topic with a question regarding the period remaining for the vacation to start. The
slightly raising intonation can be perceived as a contextualization cue that signals the need to
communicate. The question was not asked for the sake of getting information, but for the need to
communicate. This topic shift has followed the rules since it took place after the end of a previous
topic. P1 has created a participation framework in which she took the lead. Yet, by asking that

question, she was assigning the turn to the second participant (P2) to contribute to the topic,
assuming that she is going to cooperate and provide a response that suits the sequence. In line 2,
P2 picked up these cues and decided to follow the rules and contribute to the topic regardless of
her knowledge about the topic. The answer was communicative even if it was not one that included
a confirmed response. The uncertainty in providing an answer indicates that the contribution was
not really an answer to that question. Rather, it was a strategy of cooperative topic building in
which she was trying to keep the conversation going. This form of topic shift occurred after a
period of silence in which one participant needs to suggest a topic for the conversation to go on.
There were other six similar instances in the conversation that took the same form of introducing
a topic after a slightly long pause. These topics were introduced by asking questions, telling a story
about an event, talking about a daily experience, or by asking about an object that was present at
the scene where the conversation took place.
However, there was an instance of topic shift that occurred in the conversation that took a
different form. It occurred when P2 was talking about a check that she received and needed to
cash. Her topic was nearly closed after she talked about her experience regarding the procedures
she had to go through. This topic was not fully closed and was open for more contributions to be
made. The floor also allowed for a new topic to be introduced without violating the rules of topic
introduction. This topic shift was gradual with a loose phase. It took place at the following point
of the conversation as in extract 2:
Extract -23- P2: So, they took it {the cheque} (ehh a’ad akhathowh {elshaik})
4- P3: You cashed it now its with you' !so you have the money’ (enti sarafteeh elheen
ma’ek! Ajal megrisha!)
5- P2: Ya. Do you want me to get you a treat? (ehh. Taboun a’azemkum? )
6- P3: So what are your plans? (a’ad wesh masharee’ek?)
In this extract, P2 was ending her story about her day at the bank (in line 3) after a long
procedure that she had to go through. Her conclusion of the story indicates a conclusion of the
topic in which feedback is needed to move on to another topic. The falling intonation at the end of
her turn serves as a contextualization cue that signals the end of the topic. It also indicates
allocating the next turn to P3, giving her a choice to either provide feedback related to the story or
to shift the topic by introducing another. This cue has been interpreted by P3 in line 2 as a point in
which a turn has been allocated to he, choosing to provide feedback and a concluding statement at
the same time as a step to insure the end of the first topic. This transitional phase signals a gradual
topic shift in a collaborative style in which both participants are about to start the new topic. P3
has allocated the next turn to the open floor giving participants a verity of choices. The freedom
that can be noticed in the role assignment in this participation framework reflects the close
relationship between them.
In line 3, P2 responded to P3's comment offering a treat since she got paid. By this act of
offer, she was not really offering a treat but was using this act to function as a way of saying that
she really had the money. This form of using a direct question to perform an offer is not considered
an offer in the Saudi culture since it reflects uncertainty and hesitation. Her offer can be regarded
as a general statement of offering and not an intended act that may be fulfilled. Her raising-falling

intonation could be considered a contextualization cue in which it indicated that this act was not
performed as an act of offering, but as a collaborative contribution to the communication showing
her agreement that she was welling to talk about it as a potential topic that might be selected by
participants.
In line 4, P3 responded by asking a question about P2’s plans regarding what she wanted
to do. Her question was not relevant to the offer since it does not reflect refusal or approval. This
response can be interpreted in more that one way. P3 has assumed from her interpretation of the
contextualization cue that P2 was not really offering a treat. Instead, she was only communicating.
Since this act was not interpreted as an act of offering, she decided to avoid the offer and shift the
topic into another. This gradual movement from the topic of the story telling into the topic of plan
telling has been completed and a new topic has been introduced. The topic shifts that were
illustrated and examined in this section represent a case of topic shifting in which general rules of
topic shifting were followed. These extracts indicate that topic shifting among females in the Saudi
culture could be performed after a period of silence, or it could be performed with a contribution
offered as a question, explanation, experience or a story telling.
5- Topic Shifts Used in a Different Pattern:
Topic shifts in real interaction do not always follow the rules that allow for a topic to be
shifted or a topic to be introduced. Interaction reflects the complication of the configuration of the
society in general. There is an impact of social structure and power relations on conversations,
including the authority to allocate turns in conversations, to interrupt and to determine topic
continuation or switch (Saville-Troike, 2003). The sources of power are developed from different
factors based on differences in cultures that could include sources like age, gender, education, race,
color and class (Saville-Troike, 2003; Wardhaugh, 2010). Topic shifting is a process that might be
affected to a certain degree by the impact of power on discourse structure. Topic shifts were
performed in some parts of this conversation in a matter that designates a deviation from the
general rules that constrain topic shifting. These topic shifts contradict the assumption that female
language is based in its structure on cooperation and solidarity and not based on power conflict.
To set an example, the following conversation between three friends who were relatively
similar in their education, interests and background included an instance of topic shifting that was
performed based on power conflict between these conversationalists. In the following example
(extract 3), the participants were discussing a topic related to the procedures P1 had to go through
to process her cash check. While P1 was narrating the events of her experience, a topic shift
occurred before the end of her topic that took the form of an interruption as the following:
Extract -37- P1: So I went and I cashed it today' you know +she said I have t.. I was about to go
yesterday but she said I must have a card for //
(// Aad reht wa saraftaha alyum, mo galat lazim! Aa..kent abarouh ams bas
ghalat lazim betakah alashaan//)
8- P3: // you were supposed if you want to go to Noura to leave from gate four.
(//enti elmafrouth etha serti betrouheen le Noura tetlae’en men bawwaba arba’a.)
9- P1: Why would I go there.. it is so crowded.

(Wesh yuadini henak. Marra zahmah)
The conversation continued for few turns…..
In extract 3, P1 was talking about her experience at the bank while she was trying to cash
her check. While she was talking about her experience with the regulations of the bank, an
interruption accrued shifting the topic to another one that is not related to the current topic under
discussion. P1's turn was not completed and her topic was left open without a closure. According
to the rules of topic shifting, a new topic can only be introduced after the closure of the previous
one in which no contributions were about to be offered. P1 did not signal an end of her topic or of
her turn. At the same time, she did not allocate a turn to another speaker allowing for an
interruption to take place. Her intonation contour indicates a continuous speech and sequencing of
events in a chain that was not completed at the point where the interruption took place.
In line 8, P3 interrupted P1's turn without paying attention to her need to complete her turn.
Interruptions could carry corrections that are considered to be primary items licensing violations
of the turn-taking system. It is also a technique that is used for signaling a need to discuss a
different issue. In an ordinary conversation, a person waiting for a turn may decide to interrupt in
order not to loss concentration or interest. P3 at some point in the conversation felt that she needed
to discuss an urgent issue that just occurred to her and was not able to wait for P1's seemingly long
turn that was not near an end. This new topic was related to a thought that P3 had just been thinking
about. Her sudden topic shift was not performed because she was not interested in P1's experience,
nor because she did not want to cooperate with her. Instead, her shift was performed because she
wanted to suggest a solution to an existing issue. The relationship that naturally exists between
friends gives the right to advice. Interruptions that lead to a sudden topic shift can be used as
support strategies developing a pattern that shows involvement. P3's shift was not intended to
maintain power and control over the conversation. By understanding the close relationship
between participants, this shift can be considered a different form of cooperation and involvement
where participants are free to discuss issues at any point of the conversation and expect agreement
of the other participant regarding these choices and shifts. P3 allocated the turn to P1 and assumed
that she would be cooperating with her new topic that she shifted to. This suggests that the shift is
not interpreted as a violation of the rules. On the contrary, it reflects a new pattern of involvement
that is based on solidarity. This example, as well as other similar ones, indicates that topic shifts
could occur in Saudi female conversations as a result of both closeness and solidarity between
participants. Topic shifts can be introduced in a manner that contradicts with rules that regulate
the way conversations are developed. These shifts may be considered strategies of solidarity and
involvement.
6- The Overall construction of Topic shifting in the Conversation:
In this paper, two different sets of topic shifts were discussed. One set of shifts followed
the rules of shifting and the other set has diverted from these rules. The analysis of these extracts
was based on understanding the context where these topic shifts were performed, and the forms
they represented. Their numbers of occurrences along with their forms were calculated. The
following table represents each form of the topic shifts, their points of development along with
their number of occurrences in the conversation:

Participants performed two main sets of topic shifts in these conversations which involved
cooperation by following the rules at points where support was needed by asking questions, talking
about experiences, agreeing or providing details. These topic shifts were performed on solidarity
bases as opposed to other findings that regard these shifts as violations. These different types of
topic shifts that were noticed in this conversation seem to both follow and divert from general
conversational rules that allowed for their initiation.
7- Questionnaire:
A questionnaire was implemented as a means of data collection to reveal general attitudes
and perceptions regarding this linguistic behavior. Four main questions were targeted. These
questions were concerned with when does a topic shift may take place, what motivates a topic
shift, what are the topics chosen by participants based on their age and gender, and how topics
might be changed. Each main question was followed by a series of suggested statements that were
based on ideal rules of topic-circulation to be performed in ideal informal interaction. Results were
calculated and presented in tables.
7- 1: When Does Topic Change Take Place?
One of the questions asked was about the point at which a topic change would likely appear.
This question included 11 statements that centered on the length of topics, speakers’ interests,
interruptions, silence and pauses, topic order, turn-taking system and participation framework.
Statements were presented and ordered in the following table 2 according to their rank.

Table 2 indicates that the axis of when does topic change take place includes (11)
statements. It is observed from the previous table that the responses of participants were with
strongly agree degree on statement No. (1) whose mean is (4.36) which is put at the fifth category,
and refered to (strongly agree) degree as their means range from (4.21 to 5.00) degrees. The
responses were with the agree degree on ten statements whose means ranged from (3.48 to 4.15),
and these means are put at the fourth category of the five-scale degree, and referred to (agree)
degree as their means ranged from (3.41 to 4.20) degrees. Most participants strongly agreed with
the effect of topic length and interest as the most influential factors that trigger topic changes.
Participants also agreed on the effect of interruptions, silence, pauses, and participation framework
on topic change. As it is observed, there is a convergence in the responses of study respondents on
the axis (when does topic change take place). Additionally, the general mean of agreement degree
on the statements of the axis is (3.81), and referred to (agree degree) that reflects that study
respondents’ perceptions on when does topic change take place are positive.
7- 2: Motivations of Topic Change:
The second question dealt with the motivations that naturally lead to a topic change to be
performed. Ten statements were included centering on theoretically suggested motivations.
Statements included motivations such as closeness and relations between participants, interest and
need, participants and formality of the situation. Results are presented in the following table 3
arranged based on participants’ responses.

The axis of motivations of topic change includes ten statements. It is observed from the
previous table that the responses were with strongly agree degree on statements No. (1,2,3) whose
means ranged from (4.21 to 4.25), and this mean is put at the fifth category (strongly agree) degree
as their means ranged from (4.21 to 5.00) degrees. The responses were with agree degree on seven
statements whose means ranged from (3.78 to 4.18), and these means are put at the fourth category
of the five-scale degree, referred to (agree) degree. As it is noted from the above table, the
responses of study respondents strongly agreed with statements that included closeness between
participants, urgency of a topic, and discussing similar experience and telling stories as motivations
for introducing or changing a topic. As it is observed above, there is a convergence in the
responses. The general mean of agreement degree on the statements of this axis is (4.02), and this
mean is put at the fourth category whose mean ranged from (3.41 to 4.20) and referred to (agree
degree) that reflects that study respondents’ perceptions about Motivations of Topic Change are

This table indicates that the axis of topic choice includes six statements. It is observed
from the previous table that the responses are with agree degree on statements No. (1-2-3-4-5)
whose means ranged from (3.41 to 3.90) and this mean is put at the fourth category of the fivescale degree (agree). The responses of respondents were with neutral degree on statement no. (6)
whose mean is (3.31), and this mean is put at the third category of the five-scale degree (neutral
degree). As it is noted from the above table, the statements concerning this axis can be arranged in
view of the respondents themselves regarding the agreement degree. The responses on statements
related to: personal experience, something that is within the context, seeking explanations, food,
clothes and objects came with (agree) degree. The responses on topics related to something outside
the context or place of the conversation came with (neutral) degree. This reflects that perceptions
were positive.

This table indicates that the axis of how to change a topic includes six statements. It is
observed from the previous table that the responses are with agree degree on statement No. (1)
whose mean is (3.83), and this mean is put at the fourth category of the five-scale agreement
degree (agree) as their means ranged from (3.41 to 4.20) degrees. The responses were with a
neutral degree on statements no. (2-3-4-5-6) whose means ranged from (2.66 to 3.83), and this
mean is put at the third category referred to (neutral) degree as their means ranged from (2.61 to
3.40) degrees.
The statements concerning this axis can be arranged in view of the respondents themselves
regarding their agreement. The responses on statement no (1), which states that: (I change a topic
by simply talking about a new idea) came with (agree) degree. The responses on statements related
to: telling a story, expressing lack of interest, forcing the end of a topic, and interrupting came with
(neutral) degrees. As it is observed above, there was a convergence in the responses of study
respondents. Additionally, the general mean of agreement degree on the statements of this axis is
(3.15) that reflects that study respondents’ perceptions about how to change a topic are neutral.
8- Conclusions:
This paper investigates the instances of topic shifts and their construction and sequence in
a conversation between Saudi female participants. It also investigates general perceptions related
to this issue. In the data that was collected for the purpose of this paper, a number of topic shifts
have occurred. One of the most frequent shifts of topics occurred after a pause where a participant
introduced a new topic after the conclusion of the previous one. These shifts occurred by asking a
question about an item that was present in the scene, seeking explanation, or talking about a

personal experience. Other topic shifts were also observed that participants performed in different
ways. Topic change or shift might be violated in informal settings based on relations between
participants in a cooperative and supportive manner. Questionnaire results conclude that topic
change occur on the basis of interest, and motivated by closeness and need. Most frequent
circulated topics by females are ones related to personal issues and offering explanations related
to the situation. The strategy that is mostly used to perform a topic change is related to following
a queue.
The findings of this paper go along with the findings of other research papers, indicating
that topic shifts can be performed in a manner that reflects cooperation between female
participants. However, some of the findings of this paper contradict with the findings of
researchers where some other forms of topic shifting were performed on bases of power conflict
between participants, or solidarity between them. Since topic shifts take different forms and occur
in different locations in the discourse, further research needs to be carried out to investigate the
construction of topic shifts in conversations searching for other forms that can be intended by
speakers. Other research is also needed to examine other variants that can affect the forms of topic
shifts in conversations along with the markers that are used to signal these shifts.

The transcription of the tape was written by using a coding system that was adopted by Hatch (2000) in
discourse analysis by using the following:
(.) Micro-pause
. Period at end of line: clause final falling intonation
? Raising intonation of questions
- Dash: break off, unfinished words
[…] Omitted section
// Interruptions at this point by speakers
+ Short pause
++ Longer pause
+++ Long pause
, Comma: rise in intonation
: Colons: indicate the lengthening of a syllable
Uppercase typing: Stress (pitch and volume)
( ) Single parentheses: used when transcriber is using original text
(( )) Double parentheses: indicate non-verbal sounds
{ } Transcriber’s comment
