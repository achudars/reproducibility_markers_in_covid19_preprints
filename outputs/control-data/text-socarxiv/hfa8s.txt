Abstract
This paper exploits location choices of all generalist physicians graduated in Brazil
between 2001 and 2013 to study policies aiming at increasing the supply of physicians in
underserved areas. We set up and estimate a supply and demand model for physicians.
We estimate physicians’ locational preferences using a random coefficients discrete
choice model. The demand has private establishments competing for physicians with
private and public facilities around the country. Policy counterfactuals indicate that
quotas in medical schools for students born in underserved areas and the opening of
vacancies in medical schools in deprived areas are more cost-effective than financial
incentives.

Introduction

The delivery of basic services, such as healthcare, hinges on a key resource: human capital.
The lack of qualified health professionals in rural and underdeveloped areas forms a barrier
to the improvement of health outcomes of those living in these places.1 As a result, the
imbalances in the geographic distribution of physicians, who tend to be more concentrated
in metropolitan areas, have been a matter of concern in developing and developed countries
(WHO, 2010). Many governments have resorted to the use of financial and non-financial
incentives to recruit specialized professionals to needy regions.2 However, as the thriving
literature on recruiting of health and frontline providers indicates,3 attracting qualified personnel to poorer locations has been proven challenging.
This paper exploits practice location choices of all generalist physicians graduated in
Brazil between 2001 and 2013 to estimate physicians’ locational preferences and to study
counterfactual policies that aim at reducing imbalances in the geographic distribution of
these professionals. We focus on generalists because they are directly responsible for the
supply of basic healthcare. These professionals are frequently the focus of public policies
designed to reduce regional imbalances in the provision of health services.4 We estimate a
model of demand and supply of generalists. We numerically solve the model and use it to
simulate different policies.
The supply is based on a random coefficients discrete choice model where physicians
choose the region of the country they will work right after graduating from medical school.
The model allows us to understand how wages, local living and working conditions, as well
as place of birth and graduation influence physicians’ locational choice just after graduation.
The richness of our data permits us to accommodate flexible forms of heterogeneity in indi1

viduals’ preferences, including the quality of physicians’ education. Our estimates suggest
that physicians utility increases substantially if they work close to the place they were born
or completed medical school. Wages and local health infrastructure are relevant but less
important than these two types of geographic (home and graduation place) preferences. On
the demand side, we model the interactions between the public and the private sectors. We
characterize the demand for physicians as a Bertrand-Nash game where private health facilities compete for physicians with public and private health facilities operating in the different
regions of the country. Our counterfactual experiments indicate that investments in medical
schools in underserved areas and the adoption of affirmative action policies – such as quotas
in medical schools for students born in poorer regions – are more cost-effective in improving the geographic distribution of physicians than policies based on financial incentives or
investment in health infrastructure.
Brazil presents a compelling setting to study regional imbalances in the distribution of
physicians. First, there is a sizable imbalance in the presence of doctors across regions within
the country. Figure 1 shows the number of registered physicians per thousand inhabitants in
each state’s capital and countryside in 2014. While the number of physicians per thousand
people ranges from 11.9 to 1.42 across state capitals,5 the supply of doctors outside the
capitals is substantially lower, ranging from 2 to 0.1 doctors per thousand people. The
poorest states, mostly located in the Northern regions, have fewer doctors than the richest
states. Second, the imbalances in the distribution of physicians is associated to lower access
to preventive care and worse health outcomes.
We assembled a unique dataset with information on all 60,563 generalist physicians that
received a medical degree in Brazil between 2001 and 2013. We merge the registries of all
new graduates with the official records of all active physicians. We exploit this data to
track physicians from birth, through medical school and the first years of their professional
lives. A descriptive analysis of the data reveals that more than 50% of the physicians in
5

E.g., the United States had 2.6 per thousand people in 2013 and Germany had a ratio of 4.1 in 2014.

our sample choose to work in the same region as they were born or completed medical
school. Metropolitan areas in the richest regions of the country are the main destinations
of physicians that decided to migrate to a different region. Curiously, real wages in these
metropolitan areas are relatively lower than in other regions. Yet, these areas have better
amenities and health infrastructure.
To better understand how physicians preferences depend on their own characteristics and
choice attributes, we estimate a discrete choice model with random coefficients (Berry et al.,
2004). This model has the advantage of accommodating spatial correlation across locations
and flexible forms of heterogeneity across individuals. We address potential endogeneity
of wages through a control function approach (Petrin and Train, 2010). Physicians’ choice
set is composed by the pairs metropolitan region-state and countryside-state for all Brazil.
Guided by our descriptive study, we model physicians’ location choices as a function of local
(i) expected real wages, (ii) amenities, (iii) health infrastructure, (iv) stock of physicians,
(v) coverage of private health insurance, as well as physicians’ (vi) age, (vii) gender, (viii)
birthplace, (ix) graduation place, and (x) quality of the school where they graduated.
4

Our estimates show that physicians’ supply function is inelastic, with mean and median
wage elasticity ranging around 0.4 and 0.7 in metropolitan areas and in the countryside,
respectively. Our results also suggest that health infrastructure and amenities impact positively physicians’ utility. Importantly, we find that home bias and place of graduation bias
play a central role in the choice of job location. Physicians derive great utility for working
close to their place of birth and for staying in the same region from where they graduated.
As in Dal Bo et al. (2013), Agarwal (2015), and Dal Bo et al. (2013); Agarwal (2015); Diamond (2016), local characteristics appear to be as important to explain locational choices of
skilled workers as wages. In particular, the low wage elasticities may explain why financial
incentives in Brazil have not been sufficient to attract more physicians to underserved areas.
Finally, we find that preferences are heterogeneous according to the rank of the medical
school from which the physicians graduated. Those graduated from better medical schools
value more local amenities, are more inelastic to wages, derive lower value for returning to
their region of birth, and are the most inclined for staying in their locale of graduation.
Because the best schools are located in the richest areas of the country, this finding suggests
that taste heterogeneity may contribute to regional inequality in the quality of physicians.
Equipped with physicians’ labor supply, we set up a model of regional demand for physicians. We assume that each regional market is composed by an homogeneous set of public
and private health facilities. In each market, the private sector chooses private wages to
maximize profits considering wages in the public sector in that region as well as wages paid
by the public and the private sector in all other regions. We assume that public sector wages
in each region are set exogenously according to some bureaucratic process.6 Equilibrium
private wages in each region are then the result of a Bertrand-Nash game between private
health facilities operating in all geographic regions.
Lastly, we numerically solve the model and use it to estimate the cost-effectiveness of
6

To justify this assumption we present reduced form evidence showing that physicians public sector wages
do not respond to private sector wages. This assumption is also in accordance with the literature, e.g., Katz
and Krueger (1991), Duggan (2000), and Sanches et al. (2018).

different public policies on improving the geographic distribution of physicians. Following
the World Health Organization, our benchmark geographic distribution of physicians is such
that the physicians to population ratio is the same in all regions. We find that policies
exploiting physicians’ geographic preferences are the most cost-effective. First, quotas in
medical schools for students born in underserved areas reduce the geographic imbalance in
the distribution of physicians by 63% at minimal costs. Second, the opening of vacancies
in medical schools in areas lacking generalists reduces this imbalance by 65%, but at higher
costs compared to quotas. Third, an increase of 50% in wages paid by the public sector to
doctors in needy areas is also effective, but the cost of this policy is higher compared to the
first two alternatives. Last, investing in health infrastructure is less effective and the most
costly option.
Our paper directly relates to the literature that studies labor supply of qualified professionals in rural and poorer areas.7 More broadly, this paper contributes to the development
literature on recruitment of workers for service delivery,8 and the growing literature that
applies discrete choice models to study the determinants of migration decisions, demand for
neighborhoods and labor sorting.9 Our study contributes to this body of work by shedding light on new dimensions relevant to locational choices of qualified professionals and by
providing cost-effectiveness analyses of different policies. We show that geographic biases
are decisive to explain locational decisions of qualified health professionals. Importantly,
our counterfactuals clarify that the cost-effectiveness of policies acting on home bias and on
graduation place bias are substantially different.10

Kulka and McWeeny (2018) and Falcettoni (2018) study the shortage of doctors in rural areas in the
United States. Like ours, both find that physicians prefer to practice close to their residency location.
Different from these papers, we can distinguish physicians’ preferences for working close to their home region
(birthplace) or close to the school from where they graduated. As we discussed above, this differentiation is
important because policies exploiting the two types of geographic bias – home or graduation place – produce
different results. Another difference is that we consider physicians’ preferences for health infrastructure,

6

Methodologically, our model differs in two aspects from models in the literature that
study the geographic distribution of high skill professionals. First, in various markets the
demand of specialized professionals depends on the public and private sectors. We model
the interactions between these two sectors. Second, we explicitly model competition for
physicians between firms operating in different markets. Depending on the setting, private
sector wage reactions to public policies may have consequences on the results of these policies.
Last, we complement this literature by providing evidence of preferences heterogeneity
according to the quality of the education of high skill professionals. While higher wages may
attract more job candidates, it may also select individuals with weaker pro-social motivation
and affect retention and performance.11 Our estimates suggest that policies based on wages
may also affect the composition of recruited professionals by attracting those more responsive
to financial incentives, in our setting, those graduated from lower ranked universities.

Empirical Context

This section provides background information on the Brazilian context. First, we describe
the labor market for physicians in Brazil. Second, we characterize the geographic distribution of physicians and discuss policies implemented to mitigate regional imbalances in the
distribution of physicians. We close the section discussing correlations between access to
basic healthcare and health outcomes of the Brazilian population.

2.1

The Labor Market for Physicians

The Brazilian market for physicians is dichotomous; both public and private sectors are
important providers of health services in the country and physicians can work in both sectors.
The Brazilian public health system, known as the Unified Health System (Sistema Único de
which tend to be substantially lower in underdeveloped areas, particularly, in the developing world. Finally,
the demand side of our model takes into account differences in the behavior of the public and private sector
and allows wages in any market to respond to changes in relevant characteristics of other markets.

Saúde), was inspired by the National Health Services in the United Kingdom and is now one
of the largest in the world in terms of coverage. The management structure of the public
system is decentralized, with the Federal Government transferring responsibilities to states
and municipalities to make the health provision more aligned with the local needs (Elias and
Cohn, 2003). The private system also plays an relevant role covering 25% of the population
through private health insurance plans.
The public and the private sectors offer, roughly, the same types of health services.12
Services offered by the public health system are free of charge for every Brazilian citizen.
Federal, state and municipal governments have autonomy to hire physicians and health
workers, typically following budgetary restrictions of each sphere of government. The main
admission process to jobs in the public sector is through public exams.13 The private sector
hires health professionals through standard market processes and wages, working journey
and fringe benefits are negotiated between workers and employers.
Any physician can choose where to work and is apt to take both contractual arrangements.
It is very common that physicians work in more than one health facility and under a variety
of employment relationships at the same time. A survey conducted by the Federal Council
of Medicine (Scheffer et al., 2015) in 2014 with 2,400 doctors shows that around 21.6% of
physicians work exclusively in the public sector, 26.9% work exclusively in the private sector
and 51.5% have joint appointments in the public and private sectors.

2.2

Geographic Distribution of Physicians

In 1980, Brazil had 1.15 physicians per 1,000 inhabitants. After the inauguration of several medical schools in the past decades,14 the number of physicians per 1,000 inhabitants
12

There are, however, differences in the quality of the services offered by both sectors, in particular for
services offered by specialists.
13
Under this process, a number of vacancies, wages and working conditions are pre-specified and a public
recruitment process based, in general, on written exam selects the best candidates. Once an applicant for a
job in the public sector is hired, there is no room for negotiation of pre-specified working conditions.
14
Around 47% of the medical schools are public, and tuition free. Private schools’ tuition vary from around
$11,971-$41,879 dollars annually – exchange rate 3.65 BRL/USD from 31/01/2019.

Figure 2: Job Vacancies from Mais Médicos Program and Positions Filled by Brazilians
This graph shows the number of job vacancies created by the Mais Médicos Program (in blue) and the
number of Brazilian physicians that filled the open positions (in gray) per 1,000 people. The upper (bottom)
panel shows the metropolitan (countryside) regions across states.

increased to about 2.11 by the end of 2015 (Scheffer et al., 2015). Despite the growth in
the number of physicians, some regions are still severely underserved. As Figure 1 shows,
physicians are mainly concentrated in state capitals. Concentration is especially high in the
richest regions (South and Southeast). The physicians to population ratio ranges from as
high as 11.9 in Espirito Santo’s capital to 1.27 in its countryside. Across regions there is
also a considerable variation: while the countryside of Rio de Janeiro has 2.11 physicians per
1,000 people, the countryside of Piauí, one of the poorest states, has a ratio equal to 0.01.
From a different perspective, Brazilians living in cities with populations smaller than 50,000
people, which represents 32.6% of the total population, can rely on only 31,500 thousand
doctors, a ratio below 0.5 physician per 1,000 inhabitants (Scheffer et al., 2015).
The Brazilian government implemented different programs to mitigate the undersupply
of physicians in disadvantaged areas. The Primary Care Professional Valorization Program
(Provab), created in 2011, offered competitive and tax-free wages and a 10% increase in

9

the final grade in admission exams to medical specialization programs. The More Physicians
Program (Mais Médicos), created in 2013, used three strategies: (i) expansion and building of
new primary health care units in needy areas; (ii) increasing the number of medical schools
and medical residency programs in areas suffering from undersupply; and (iii) opening of
primary health care jobs with good wages in underserved areas (Carrillo and Feres, 2019).
Despite all the effort, the government could not fill all new positions. Figure 2 presents
the number of vacancies created by the More Physicians Program and the number of physicians graduated in Brazil that filled the vacancies (per 1,000 people) between July 2013 to
July 2014. As is evident, most of the vacancies remained unfilled, especially those in the
countryside and in poorer states. Given the excess demand for physicians, the government
started to source foreign doctors, especially from Cuba. This suggests that policies based
mainly on financial incentives were not sufficient to reduce regional imbalances and that the
main hurdle to overcome this imbalance is not the lack of positions with good wages, but
some other aspect behind physicians’ locational preferences.

2.3

Health Provision and Health Outcomes

The inadequate supply of physicians has immediate implications for local access to healthcare
and, possibly, for the health status of the population.15 Figure A1 displays some measures
of access to healthcare and health outcomes in rural and urban areas in Brazil. The picture
is clear: the population in rural areas tend to have lower access to healthcare and worse
related health outcomes than in urban areas. For example, those living in the countryside
are about 38% less likely to have been to a doctor’s appointment in the last 12 months
than those living in urban areas. Infants in rural areas are about 20% less likely to visit
the doctor in the first 30 days of life, and about 50% more likely to not have gone through
the recommended number of prenatal care visits than infants in urban areas. Perhaps as a
consequence, infant mortality is 18% higher in rural areas.
15

Please, see Appendix A for a more detailed discussion.

10

This gap between rural and urban seems to be driven in part by the lower number of
physicians per capita in rural areas. Table A1 presents the regression estimates of three
different measures of infants’ and women’s health statuses on the number of physicians per
capita across Brazilian municipalities between 2005 and 2016. We find a positive and strong
correlation between physicians per capita in a given municipality-year and infants’ health
outcomes even when we add countryside and state fixed effects.
In sum, the descriptive evidences shown in this section suggests that: (i) there is a large
regional imbalance in the distribution of doctors in Brazil, both across different states and
across rural or urban areas within states; (ii) health outcomes in underserved areas tend to
be worse. This helps understanding the amount of attention given to this matter by national
and international institutions.

Data and Descriptive Analysis

This section provides preliminary evidence on the importance of different local attributes
to physicians choices, that we use to guide the formulation of the structural model in the
next sections. First, we describe the data sources, our sample and variables – Appendix
D provides more details. Alongside, we present the summary statistics of our data, and
descriptive evidence on practice location choices of physicians in our sample.

3.1

Data

Sample and aggregation level. Our sample consists of all physicians graduated between
2001 and 2013. We aggregate geographical units into pairs metropolitan region/state and
countryside/state, amounting to 52 possible choices.16 All explanatory variables are averaged
at this geographical level for the year prior to graduation because we assume physicians
16
Using finer spatial units leads to higher computational costs and, more importantly, a large number of
cells (region-year) not being chosen by any physician. Brazil has 26 states plus the Federal District that has
no countryside. The state of Santa Catarina is composed primarily of metropolitan regions.

graduating and making locational choice at year t observe local characteristics at year t − 1.
Physicians and practice location. Our primary data source are the records of all physicians in Brazil, active or not, maintained by the Federal Council of Medicine (CFM). This
registry contains physicians’ names, cities of birth, medical schools attended and the beginning and conclusion dates of physicians’ training. We have 149,637 physicians that were
born and completed medical school in Brazil between 2001 and 2013, our period of study.
To restrict attention to generalist physicians, we merge this database through name and
registration number with the National Commission of Medical Residency (CNRM), which
contains all physicians who applied for specialist training. We have that 40% of recent graduates in our sample did not pursue a residency program, leaving us with 60,563 generalist
physicians, which are the focus of our research.
We link all generalists with the registry of all formal job links from the Ministry of
Labor (RAIS, Ministry of Labor) from 2001 to 2015 and the National Register of Health
Establishments (CNES, Ministry of Health) from 2005 to 2016, using their full name. In
the first database we observe detailed information about all employer-employee links, which
makes it possible to see in which cities physicians with formal job contracts are working, as
well as their wages, working hours, age and gender. The second database keeps records of
all active physicians working in the public or private sectors. With these two datasets we
know the workplace of all active physicians.17 We find the workplace of 78% of all generalist
physicians within their first three years from graduation, leaving us with a final sample of
46,989 physicians.18 Reassuringly, as the descriptive statistics in Table A2 show, physicians
that made it into our final sample do not look systematically different from the ones we lose.
Table 1 presents the summary statistics. Column 1 reports where the physicians in our
sample chose to work. It depicts a similar scenario to the one in Figure 1. The recent
graduates in our sample choose to work more in capitals and metropolitan areas, and more
17

If a physician works in more than one region, we consider only the one with higher working hours.
We actually lose only 5.5% of generalist physicians in the merge with RAIS and CNES. We find the
remaining 16.5% after more than three years from graduation. We do not consider these physicians because
we cannot assure these regions were their first location choice after medical school.
18

12

than 50% of all physicians took a job in the Southeast region. Only 26.6% of the generalists
who graduated in the period started their careers in the North and Northeast regions, which
includes more than 36% of the Brazilian population.
Birth and medical school location. We create dummies equal to one for physicians that
choose to work in their birth place or in the same location where they completed medical
school. As Table 1 column 2 shows, 55% of doctors graduated in the Southeast. On the other
extreme, the countrysides of the North, Northeast, and Midwest graduated only 1.14% of all
physicians. A similar, but less extreme, pattern can be seen in physicians’ birth location.
Quality of medical schools. We proxy the quality of Brazilian medical schools using the
ranks of university courses published by Folha de São Paulo newspaper in 2013. Brazil had
214 medical schools in our time frame. The top 25 schools graduated 17% of the doctors
in our sample, and these universities are mostly concentrated in metropolitan regions of the
South, Southeast, and Midwest. Around 38% of generalists graduated in universities ranked
outside the top 100. The mean (median) rank of physicians in our sample are 83 (71).
Physicians per 1,000 people. We compute the number of physicians per 1,000 people
from CNES. This variable captures both competition effects (that is, more saturated regional
markets), and peer effects (more physicians could bring greater learning opportunities and
networking). The pattern in Table 1 column 4 resemble the one shown in Figure 1.
Health infrastructure. The lack of equipment, supplies and appropriate health units may
affect physicians’ decisions of where to work. To assess how physicians perceive the working
environment in each region, we measured the availability of essential medical equipment to
diagnose and treat patients using CNES data from 2005 to 2015 on the per capita number of
ultrasound and x-ray machines, mammographs, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) scanners across Brazilian regions. With these ratios, we developed
a normalized index of health infrastructure as in Kling et al. (2007). Table 1 column 5
shows that health infrastructure is the worst exactly in regions with fewer physicians: the
countryside of the North and Northeast.

they were born. Columns 4–9 show the regions’ attributes, respectively: (4) the ratio of physicians per 1,000
people; (5) the health infrastructure index; (6) the percentage of the population that has health insurance;
(7) the amenity index has mean zero and their values vary between: [-1.04,1.98]; (8) the average hourly wage
generalists up to 35 years old receive in each region, multiplied by the living cost index.

Private health insurance coverage. As a proxy for opportunities in the private market,
we use the coverage of private health insurance in each region, obtained from the National
Regulatory Agency for Private Health Insurance and Plans (ANS). Column 6 shows, again,
that the richest regions are also the ones with a higher percentage of the population covered
by health insurance – 37.5% and 25.5% in the metropolitan areas of the Southern regions
against 1.8% and 2.4% in the countryside of the Northern regions.

14

Amenities. Local amenities play an important role in labor sorting of skilled workers
(e.g. Diamond, 2016). To summarize an area’s observable quality of life, we computed
a local amenity index which includes: (i) education, comprising the scores in a national
exam of local elementary schools (INEP); (ii) entertainment, quantified by the number of
cinemas, hotels, restaurants and recreation firms per capita (RAIS and the Cinema Regulatory Agency/ANCINE); (iii) transportation (RAIS and the National Traffic Department/DENATRAN); (iv) violence measured by the number of violent deaths per capita
(Mortality Information System SIM/DATASUS); (v) local GDP per capita; and (vi) public
investment by the state and municipal governments (National Treasure).19 We combine all
these variables into one amenity index as Kling et al. (2007). Table 1 column 7 shows that
the imbalance follows the same pattern documented in the health infrastructure index with
the countryside of the North and the Northeast, again, having the worst amenities.
Wages. We also construct a measure of physicians’ expected compensation. For each of the
52 decision units we calculate the average hourly wage of recently graduated physicians (up
to 35 years old) using RAIS. This data allows us to identify the type of contract, that is,
whether the physician is a public or private employee. We use this information to obtain the
wages in the private and public sectors, as well as the number of jobs physicians’ held in each
sector. Average wages, therefore, correspond to the weighted average of wages paid by the
public and private sectors in each region. Given that this data only covers formal jobs, this
measure underestimates total physician income as it does not account for off-book earnings.
However, the average hourly wage in the formal labor market is strongly correlated with
the earnings opportunities in the informal markets,20 so this measure captures a meaningful
variation in physicians’ compensation over time and across regions. We adjust the expected
wages for local living costs, calculated using the values of real estate rentals from the National
19

The choice of these features was based on the amenity index developed by Diamond (2016), and adapted
to the Brazilian data availability and context.
20
Using Census data, Figure A3 shows a strong correlation between physicians’ wages in formal and
informal jobs.

15

Household Sample Survey (PNAD) and the 2010 Census.21
The last column in Table 1 shows the average wage per hour earned by recently graduated
generalists (in 2010 BRL) adjusted by local living costs. Differently from the other variables,
we see that physicians’ real hourly wages are considerably higher in the countryside than
in the corresponding metropolitan regions. Likewise, generalists in the poorest regions tend
to earn more in real terms than those in the most developed areas. This indicates that less
developed areas already pay a premium to physicians in order to compensate worse amenities
and working conditions. These financial incentives, however, do not suffice to correct the
large imbalance in the number of generalist physicians per capita across the country.

Descriptive Analysis

We present descriptive evidence to illustrate how the set of local attributes may influence
physicians practice location choices. Panel A in Table 2 describes practice location choices of
physicians born in different regions of the country. Each cell (i, j) in the table has the fraction
of physicians born in region i (row) that decided to work in region j (column). Analogously,
the rows in Panel B indicate the region physicians completed medical school and columns
their practice location choices. The analysis of these two panels reveals interesting patterns.
First, as the main diagonal of both panels illustrates, most physicians prefer to stay in
the same region they were born or completed medical school. Overall, 62.2% (60.6%) of
the physicians in our sample stays in the same region they were born (completed medical
school). This number is even larger for physicians that were born (or completed medical
school) in the most developed areas of the country (South and Southeast). These numbers
suggest that home and graduation place biases are very strong for physicians.
Second, the Southeast, the richest area of the country, attracts a relatively large number of physicians that were born (or completed medical school) in the other regions of the
21

We regress the rental value against many property’s characteristics and a set of dummies that identifies
in which region the property is located (Summers, 1973). Potential sample selection issues related to the
fact that rented households may differ in many ways from those not rented are addressed using Heckman
(1979). Section D provides more details on how this measure was constructed.

This table shows the practice location choices of physicians born and graduated in different regions of the
country. In Panel A, each cell (i, j) in the table has the fraction of physicians born in region i (row) that
decided to work in region j (column). Analogously, in Panel B indicate the region physicians did medical
school (rows) and their practice location choices (column). Numbers in bold mark the diagonal.

country. For example, 13.2% (8.3%) of the physicians that were born in metropolitan areas
(countryside) of the North migrated to have their first job in the Southeast region. In total,
approximately 10% of physicians born in the North move to the Southeast after graduation.
Similar patterns are observed when we look at panel B.
The descriptive analysis appears to indicate that, after graduation, physicians tend to stay
close to the place they were born or completed medical school. Physicians that migrate to a
geographic region that is different from the geographic region they were born (or completed
medical school) prefer regions with better health infrastructure and amenities but that pay
17

relatively lower wages. Jointly, these evidence may indicate that wages are not as important
as other local attributes to explain physicians locational preferences.

Empirical Framework

This section characterizes our structural model and estimation procedure. The framework
is intended to capture key characteristics of physicians’ labor supply and of the demand for
physicians in Brazil. The labor supply is a discrete choice model that describes physicians’
practice location choices as a function of a wide set of information on physicians’ characteristics and practice location choices – see Berry et al. (2004). We also develop a model of local
demand for physicians in which physicians may work for the public and the private sectors.
Our demand model incorporates the different dynamics in these two sectors. In particular,
we consider a profit maximizing private sector that competes for the supply of physicians
with the public and the private sector in the different regions of the country. We close the
section by describing strategies that we employ to estimate the model.

4.1

Labor Supply

We assume that right after graduating from medical school at year t physician i chooses a
practice location j among J ≥ 1 different practice locations. We define location as the pair
(state, area), where state is one of the 26 Brazilian states plus the Federal District; and area
is either state capital including metropolitan region or countryside. Physician i’s indirect
latent utility from choosing location j is given by:

uijt =

X

xjtk β̃ik + ξj + ξ˜j · t + ξ˜jt + εij ,

(1)

k

β̃ik = βkc +

X

o
zir βkr
+ βku vik .

(2)

r

In this model, the variables xjtk represent observed attributes of location j at year t, such
18

as local health infrastructure, indexes that capture quality of local amenities, etc. Physicians’
average real wages, wjt , are included in the vector of observed attributes of each location.22
Analogously, ξ˜jt condenses local characteristics that are not in our data (e.g. quality of local
restaurants, quality of cultural life, etc) and is left as an error term. We also include in
the model a location fixed-effect, ξj , capturing unobserved attributes of location j that are
constant over time (e.g. natural attributes) and ξ˜j · t is a location specific time trend. In
practice, as in Nevo (2000), ξj is modeled as location specific dummies and the term ξ˜j · t is
modeled as an interaction between a time trend and the location dummies. The remaining
error term, εij , represents an idiosyncratic preference that physician i has over location j
and β̃ik represents the effect of a given observed attribute of location j at year t, say xjtk ,
on physician i’s indirect utility.23
The terms β̃ik are decomposed into a choice specific constant, βkc , observed physicians
characteristics, zir , and unobserved physicians characteristics, vik . In other words, physician
i’s “tastes” for each observed attribute of location j at year t are allowed to vary according to
o
their observed and unobserved characteristics. The components βkr
and βku capture, respec-

tively, the effects of observed and unobserved physicians characteristics on β̃ik . Sometimes
o
}kr and {βku }k , respectively. The
we use β c , β o and β u to denote the vectors {βkc }k , {βkr

variables zir contain physicians attributes that are present in our data, such as age, gender
and the rank of the medical school physician i graduated from. The variables vik contain
physicians’ unobserved characteristics (e.g. marriage status, number of children, etc).
Substituting equation (2) into equation (1) we obtain a model that governs physicians’
practice location choice:

uijt = δjt +

X

o
xjtk zir βkr

xjtk vik βku + εij ,

(3)

22

We discuss the process that determines wjt in the next subsection.
We are suppressing the time index t for all variables that are already indexed by i. We are doing this
because each individual is observed only at the year they graduate from medical school, i.e., the index i also
represents year of graduation. By using the index t together with the index i we would give to the reader
the erroneous impression that each individual is observed at different points in time. However, keep in mind
that observed choice attributes can be different for individuals graduating in different cohorts.
23

19

δjt =

X

xjtk βkc + ξj + ξ˜j · t + ξ˜jt .

(4)

k

This formulation captures two important features of our framework. First, substitution
patterns across different locations are allowed to depend on observed and unobserved physicians’ attributes. Physicians with different observed and/or unobserved characteristics give
different weight for the same observed choice attribute. In practice, the inclusion of these
interactions produces a model with flexible substitution patterns (see Berry et al., 1995,
2004; Nevo, 2000). Second, the variables xjtk summarize a finite set of attributes of location
j that are relevant for i’s decision process. However, as the list of relevant local aspects
can be quite large and/or partially unobserved by the econometrician, not all the relevant
characteristics of location j are included in our xjtk . The role of ξ˜jt , of the time invariant
and time varying location fixed-effects – ξj and ξ˜j · t, respectively – is to account for all the
relevant characteristics of location j affecting i’s decision that are not included in xjtk .
Physicians are assumed to choose a single location, j ∈ {1, 2, ..., J} in order to maximize their utility – expressed by equations (3) and (4). This defines a set of unobserved
individual/location attributes that is associated with the choice of each location. From this
set we can obtain the probability of any given physician i choosing any given location j,
sijt (xt , zi ; θ), as a function of preference parameters, θ, observed individual characteristics,
zi , and observed location characteristics, xt . We will precisely characterize these probabilities
later in this section. Now we turn to the demand model.

4.2

Demand for Labor

In many countries, as in Brazil, the public and private sectors are important providers of
jobs for newly graduated physicians. As we mentioned in Section 2, most physicians have
jobs in public and private health facilities at the same time. Our demand model explicitly
incorporates the interactions between these two sectors.
We start by assuming that average wages paid to generalists at region j, period t, wjt ,

20

, wjt
corresponds to the fraction

of time physicians devote to jobs in the public sector at the same region and period of
time.24 We assume that λjt (·) is a differentiable function of public and private wages. We
do not give a structural interpretation to the function λjt (·). We see it as a “reduced form”
approximation to physicians’ decision process that determines how they split their working
journey between the public and the private sectors. This formulation is consistent with the
fact that in Brazil most physicians have joint appointment in the public and private sectors.
We discuss the estimation of λjt (·) in the next subsection.
Private sector. To characterize the process that determines private wages, we assume that
at any region j there exists a set of homogeneous private health facilities that maximizes
pri
profits by choosing the wage offered to physicians, wjt
. Private health facilities solve:

Ljt is the private wage elasticity of Ljt (·) and ελjt is the private wage elasticity of

and λjt (·), we can recover pjt from the system of first order conditions of this problem, that
implicitly defines private wages as a function of public wages in all regions.
Public sector. Modeling the behavior of the public sector is more complex. In particular,
differently from the private sector, it is not obvious what is the objective function of the public
sector. Indeed, an extensive literature on the behavior of public hospitals finds that they
respond differently to financial incentives when compared to private hospitals (e.g., Duggan,
2000). We take an agnostic approach and assume that public wages are exogenously given
according to some bureaucratic or political process. Similar assumptions have been used to
model the behavior of public enterprises in other settings (e.g., Sanches et al., 2018).
We test the plausibility of this assumption by running regressions of public wages on
private wages controlling for location and time fixed effects and using instruments for private
wages.26 Table A3 shows that the coefficients attached to private wages are not significant
– the point estimate is equal to -0.03 (p-value 0.84) in our preferred specification. This is
25

This supply function is obtained from the aggregation of physicians location choice as described in the
previous subsection. See also the next subsection for more details on how we compute this function.
26
These instruments are the same we use to instrument average wages in the aggregate labor supply
equation. They are discussed in the next subsection.

22

consistent with evidence that wages in the public sector are much less responsive to market
conditions than wages in the private sector (see Katz and Krueger, 1991).
Under the assumption that public sector wages are set exogenously, we can use the system
of first order conditions of private hospitals in all regions – equation (8) – to solve the model
for the (Bertrand-Nash) vector of equilibrium private wages and the fraction of generalists
working in the public and private sectors. This completes the description of the demand side
of our model. Next we discuss how we estimate the primitives of supply and demand.

4.3

Estimation

The main issue behind the estimation of the supply model is that average wages at any given
location are likely to depend on unobserved location attributes, ξ˜jt – which is assumed to be
known by physicians and health facilities but not by the econometrician. To deal with this
issue, we apply the control function approach pioneered by Heckman and Robb (1985) and
adapted by Petrin and Train (2010) for the estimation of Random Utility Models.27
We define the instruments for average wages in location j, period t as the average value
of observed attributes of other locations except location j that are in the same geographic
region28 as location j, period t – i.e., the average of variables xjtk in equation (1), except
wages, across all j 0 6= j that are at the same geographic region as location j (see Berry
et al., 1995). Equation (8) provides a justification for this assumption. It shows that private
wages at any region respond to observed wages and characteristics of all other regions. This
approach will be valid if observed location attributes are determined exogenously (see Nevo,
2000). Notice also that we are already including a full set of region fixed-effects in our model.
We believe that this helps to mitigate potential problems with endogeneity of wages.
27

Another popular method to solve endogeneity problems of this type is the one developed in Berry et al.
(1995). This method is not suitable for our application because the observed probabilities of some individuals
choosing some locations are zero. In this case the contraction mapping used to recover ξjt does not converge
and we cannot form the moment conditions necessary to recover the parameters of interest. According to
Petrin and Train (2010) both procedures produce very similar results.
28
Brazil is divided in five geographic regions (North, Northeast, Midwest, Southeast and South). These
regions have similar geographic and economic characteristics. To calculate the instrument we consider the
pairs Region-Metropolitan Area and Region-Countryside.

23

We perform robustness exercises using as additional instruments the wages of university professors (excluding physicians) in the public sector (i) in the same region, and (ii)
in neighboring regions. We use university professors wages because they are also high skill
professionals and in, Brazil, wages in the public sector are set based on years of formal
education and experience. Implicitly, to use the first (second) instrument we are assuming
that unobserved characteristics of a given region – that are relevant to explain physicians
choices – are not correlated with wages of public universities professors in that (neighboring)
region(s). There are reasons to believe that these assumptions are plausible. Most public
universities are controlled by the federal government and wages paid by federal universities,
by law, must be the same across regions. This implies that wages paid by federal universities do not depend on characteristics (observed or unobserved) of any particular region.
Nonetheless, average wages in federal universities vary across regions because they depend
on faculty composition, such as degrees and seniority.
Mathematically, we assume that average wages are a linear function of the other observed location attributes (except wages) including location and year fixed effects, x̃jt , the
instruments (as explained in the previous paragraph), hjt , and an error term, ηjt :

wjt = x̃jt γ1 + hjt γ2 + ηjt .

(9)

The instrumental variables, hjt , do not enter utility directly but affects wages. The vector
(γ1 , γ2 ) contains the parameters of the wage equation. We further assume that ηjt and ξ˜jt
are uncorrelated with x̃jt and hjt but are not independent of each other. In other words,
wages in location j depend on local observed attributes and an idiosyncratic term, ηjt , that
may be correlated with unobserved local attributes, ξ˜jt . The correlation between ηjt and ξ˜jt
is captured by the following process:
ξ˜jt = ηjt ψ1 + η̃jt ψ2 ,

24

(10)

where, ψ1 and ψ2 are parameters to be estimated and η̃jt is an error term.
We next define physicians’ location choice probabilities based on equations (3), (4), (9)
and (10). Given the instruments, hjt , we can recover the variable ηjt via OLS from equation
(9), so we proceed as if ηjt and (γ1 , γ2 ) are known. This term is our control function. It
captures the correlation between wages and unobserved local attributes. Therefore, the
observed variables of the model are xjtk and zir , the unobserved variables are vik , η̃jt and εij ,
n o 



and the parameters are θ = ψ1 , ψ2 , β c , β o , β u , {ξj }j , ξ˜j

j

.

To obtain physicians’ choice probabilities, we still have to specify the joint distribution
of the unobserved variables, vik , η̃jt and εij . Following Petrin and Train (2010) and Berry
et al. (2004) we assume that: (i) εij is iid across i and j with Extreme Value distribution;
(ii) the unobserved individual characteristics, vik , are iid across i and k with a standard
normal distribution; and (iii) the error term η̃jt is iid across j and t with standard normal
distribution. Based on these assumptions, the probability of physician i graduating at year t
choosing practice location j as a function of the the vector of parameters θ and the observed
individual and location characteristics can be expressed as:

sijt (xt , zi ; θ) =

xjtk βkc + ξj + ξ˜j · t + ηjt ψ1 + η̃jt ψ2 , Fv is the cumulative distribution of

unobserved individual tastes vik , and Fη̃ is the cumulative distribution of η̃jt .
We first estimate equation (9) by OLS and recover the error term ηjt . This term, along
with the observed variables, is plugged into the integral in equation (11). The integral is
approximated via Monte Carlo simulation. The terms vik and η̃jt are drawn from a standard
normal distribution. For each draw, the logit equation inside the integral is calculated. This
process is repeated 150 times – i.e., for each individual in our sample we draw a sequence

25

of 150 (vi , η̃) vectors from Fv and Fη̃ .29 We calculate the integral in (11) as the average
across draws of the logit formula. We estimate the vector of parameters, θ, via Simulated
Maximum Likelihood. To obtain the aggregate supply of physicians at each location-year,
which we call Ljt (wt ), we integrate equation (11) over the distribution of individuals in our
sample.
For the policy analysis we conduct in Section 6, we also need to estimate the following
elements: (i) the fraction of hours physicians work for the private sector at each region and
period of time, λjt (·);30 and (ii) marginal revenues of private facilities at each region and
period of time, pjt .
We assume that λjt (·) is characterized by the following equation:

Estimates and Model Fitting

This section presents the estimates of physicians’ labor supply and demand parameters and
shows the fitting of our model. First, we describe the estimates of the aggregate supply, the
function that characterizes the share of physicians working in the private sector, and the
wage elasticities of physicians’ aggregate supply. We close the section describing the fitting
of our supply model to the data.

5.1

Estimates

We estimate four different versions of the supply model. Tables 3 and 4 show the estimates
of the parameters β c and β o in equation (2).32 The first two columns in Table 3 illustrate
the estimates of the Logit model – i.e. the version of the full model where β u is restricted to
zero. The last two columns have the Random Coefficients Logit estimates. In both models,
we present estimates without (columns 1 and 3) and with (columns 2 and 4) correction for
endogeneity of wages – that is, using the control function.33 All equations include location
fixed effects and an interaction between location fixed effects and year. The observed local
attributes used in all specifications were described in Section 3. All variables were normalized
has a logistic distribution, as in equation (12). An advantage of the logistic model is that it has a closed
form, which simplifies the solution of the model.
32
Table A5 reports the coefficients attached to the interactions between local attributes and unobserved
physicians’ characteristics, β u . In both models only the interactions with place of birth and graduation place
are significant.
33
The inclusion of the control function in equation (11) biases maximum likelihood standard-errors. We
attempted to correct our standard-errors using bootstrap. However, as the random coefficients model takes
on average 3 days to run, the bootstrap method for the random coefficients model showed to be computationally unfeasible. We computed bootstrap standard-errors for the logit models only. We observed that the
differences between bootstrapped standard-errors and maximum likelihood standard-errors are minimal.

to be between 0 and 1, thus the magnitudes of the coefficients are comparable across different
variables. As a robustness, we estimate the model restricting physicians’ choice set according
to the historical placement of each medical school.34
Overall, the sign of our estimates are as expected in both the Logit and Random Coefficient models and in consonance with the descriptive evidence in Section 3. Health infrastructure and amenities seem to increase physicians’ utility and are statistically significant,
suggesting that physicians value working and living conditions. The dummies of place of
birth and local where the physician graduated are also positive and significant, meaning that
home bias and moving costs are taken into account in the choice of work location. On the
other hand, the number of physicians per capita and the coverage of health insurance are
not statistically significant.
The main difference between both models is the sign of wages. In the models we do not
use control function (columns 1 and 3), wages have a negative but small sign. However,
when we use the control function (columns 2 and 4), the coefficients attached to wages are
positive and statistically significant. We report the first stage estimates – parameters (γ1 , γ2 )
in equation (2) – in Table A6. The coefficient attached to ηjt – from equation (10) displayed
in the last row of second column – is also negative and statistically significant, suggesting
that wages and unobserved local attributes are negatively correlated. This result is also
expected: health facilities in areas where the value of unobserved local attributes is higher
may be able to attract physicians paying lower wages. Similar patterns are also observed in
studies of demand for differentiated products.35
Tables A7 and A8 present robustness exercises using the wages of university professors
(excluding physicians) in the public sector as additional instruments. The point estimates
of the wage coefficient using these instruments have similar magnitudes and precision as our
34

Precisely, we identify the set of locations graduates from each medical school chose over our time frame.
We, then, estimate a version of the model restricting the choice set of all students in each medical school to
this set locations. As Tables A12 and A11 show, results are quantitatively similar.
35
This type of endogeneity induces a positive bias in the coefficient attached to prices in studies of demand for differentiated products, as prices are expected to be positively correlated with unobserved product
attributes (see Berry et al., 1995; Nevo, 2000).

30

main estimates.
Finally, we show the estimates of λjt (·) in Table A4. Column 3 has the OLS estimates of
the effects of wage differentials on the share of physicians working in the private sector. The
coefficient is positive and statistically significant at 1%. Column 4 has the estimate when we
instrument wage differentials with the same instruments we used for average wages. With
instruments, the coefficient attached to wage differentials increases to 2.45 and remains
significant at 1%. As expected, it indicates that increases in private wages relatively to
public wages lead to increases in physicians’ supply to the private sector.

5.1.1

Heterogeneous preferences

In our model, the interaction terms between local attributes and physicians’ observed characteristics capture observable heterogeneous preferences. Our estimates suggest that the fixed
cost of migration is lower for men than for women. We find that men derive lower value
for staying in the locale of their graduation and those born in metropolitan regions are less
inclined to work close their birth place than women.
Importantly, physicians’ supply seems to be different according to the rank of the course
each physician graduated from. We see that those who graduated from better medical schools
derive higher utility from local amenities, have lower wage elasticity, and derive lower utility
from returning to their region of birth – note that the top medical school in Brazil has a
rank index equal to zero, and those with the worse evaluations have a rank index close to
one. Those who graduated from better quality schools in metropolitan regions derive the
greatest utility from staying in their local of graduation.36
36
The interpretation of the coefficient of wage and university ranks are subject to an additional caveat.
Those graduated from the very best schools may earn more than the average recent graduate, such that the
average wage has smaller influence in their location choice. Likewise, most qualified physicians may expect to
have greater earnings trajectories for staying in more competitive markets, such as the metropolitan regions.

Wage elasticities

Finally we report in Table 5 the average wage elasticities of the aggregate supply of physicians, Ljt (·). Columns 1 and 2 (3 and 4) show own elasticities and the minimum of cross
wage elasticities for metropolitan areas (countryside). Physicians’ supply function is inelastic
with respect to average wages. The highest own wage elasticity across metropolitan areas
is around 0.93 and the lowest is around 0.27. Elasticities in the countryside are relatively
higher than in metropolitan areas for most states. These numbers are in line with previous
estimates found in the health literature.37

5.2

Model Fitting

We close the section by discussing the fitting our model to the data. We say the model correctly predicted physician i’s choice if we observe physician i choosing location j in the data
and, in the model, the probability of going to location j is one of the 3 largest probabilities
over the 52 possible locations. Table A9 shows the model predicts correctly the locational
37

Baltagi et al. (2005) use a dynamic panel of 1303 male physicians in Norway to estimate a standard
supply function (hours worked on wages) and find a wage elasticity of 0.33. Andreassen et al. (2013) studies
how wages affect physicians choices over 10 different jobs packages and find wage elasticities around 0.04.

32

choice of 78.9% of the physicians.38 Furthermore, our model performs well compared to
other papers in this literature. For example, in Bayer et al. (2016), 47% of households chose
one of the top 10% choices ranked by the model.39
We show the fitting of the function that describes the proportion of physicians working
in the private sector, λjt (·), in Table A10. The estimates of the proportion of physicians
working in the private sector are close to the proportions observed in the data, except in
the North region where the model over predicts the fraction of physicians working in the
private sector. We also compare average wages computed from equation (5) and average
wages observed in the data (see Table A10). Again, our estimates of average wages are close
to the observed average wages.

Counterfactuals and Policy Analysis

What types of policies are more effective to reduce the regional imbalances in the geographic
distribution of physicians in Brazil? To answer this question, we compare the counterfactual
distribution of physicians produced by four policies: a policy of quotas in medical schools
according to students place of birth, redistribution of vacancies in medical schools across
the country, improvement of health infrastructure in underdeveloped regions, and financial
incentives (increasing public wages in targeted areas).
We also provide a meaningful back-of-the-envelope calculation of the cost-effectiveness
of these counterfactual policies. The goal of this exercise is to have an internally consistent
way to compare the cost-effectiveness of policies acting on different margins of physicians’
preferences. We close the section with discussions on some important features of our framework.
Technically, we simulate the four counterfactual scenarios by numerically solving the
38

For 58.3% of physicians, the most likely location to be chosen by the physician is the actual chosen
location. A model that randomly allocates physicians to the 52 locations would predict correctly the choice
of approximately only 1.92% (1/52) of the physicians.
39
Hurley (1991) and Bolduc et al. (1996) correctly predicts 41% and 31.25% of choices across 7 and 18
alternatives, respectively.

This table shows the counterfactual distribution and the cost-benefit of different policy simulations. We use
the random coefficients model with a control function and 150 draws. Column (1) shows the population
distribution (the benchmark to be achieved) and Column (2) where physicians chose to work according to
our original model. The following columns show the counterfactual distribution of generalists if: (3) medical
schools have quotas based on place of birth; (4) targeted creation of new vacancies in medical schools in places
with the lowest student-populaiton ratio; (4) wages and (5) health infrastructure in the North and Northeast
countrysides increased by 50%. The quadratic error indicates how far the counterfactual distributions are
from the population one. Bellow, there is the percentage reduction in quadratic error each counterfactual
would produce relative to the predicted distribution quadratic error. The last row shows the cost (2010
USD) incurred in each policy for a 1% reduction in imbalance. The lower (upper) bound cost of opening new
medical school vacancies are calculated with the average cost of vacancies in a public (private) university.

system of first order conditions represented by equation (8) for each policy. We obtain for
all periods the vector of equilibrium private wages that is consistent with the counterfactual
change using our estimates of the aggregate supply function and of the share of physicians
working in the private sector. We then calculate the supply of physicians in each region
using the new equilibrium vector of private wages and assuming the policy change.
We evaluate each counterfactual distribution of physicians against the population share
in each region. This benchmark follows the WHO recommendation of a minimum of 2.3
health workers per thousand people (WHO, 2006). Table 6 column 1 shows the share of the
population in each region. Column 2 shows the predicted distribution of physicians according

34

to our random coefficient model with control function evaluated at average wages computed
from equation (5). The quadratic error of 0.57 depicts the baseline distribution imbalance
originated from our model relative to the benchmark distribution. Columns 3-6 show the
counterfactual distribution of physicians implied by the four policies we discuss next.

6.1

Medical school quotas based on place of birth

The descriptive evidence in Subsection 3.2 and the estimates of the supply function indicate
that home bias is important to explain physicians’ location decisions in Brazil. Based on that,
we first consider an affirmative action policy that sets quotas in medical schools according to
the fraction of the population living in each area of the country. For example, if region “A”
has 30% of the population and region “B” has 70%, then 30% and 70% of the vacancies in
all medical schools would be allocated to students born in region “A” and “B”, respectively.
This policy could be implemented, e.g., through a centralized admission system resembling
the Brazilian Unified Selection System (SISU) already in place.40
Table 6 column 3 shows the counterfactual distribution of physicians resulting from this
policy. Implementing the quota system would improve the distribution of physicians in the
country by approximately 64% – the quadratic error between the observed and benchmark
distribution of physicians would fall from 0.57 to 0.20. We would observe, in particular, a
substantial increase in the fraction of physicians working in the countryside of the North
and Northeast regions, the two most vulnerable areas of the country. Because this policy
does not change the location of medical schools, only the composition of their students, it is
relatively cheap to be implemented.41

Machado and Szerman (2016) find that SISU enabled universities to attract more students from different
states. In the United States, Fitzpatrick and Jones (2016) find that merit aid programs targeted at state-born
individuals increase the likelihood that residents live in their home state after graduation.
41
The main hidden cost of this type of policy is a potential loss in efficiency of the educational system
caused by a mismatch between school and student quality. Evidence on the effect of affirmative actions on
graduation rates and earnings are weak (see Arcidiacono and Lovenheim, 2016, for a review). Estevan et al.
(2018) show that a quotas targeting poorer students in Brazil did not reduce the effort of targeted applicants.

Targeted creation of new vacancies in medical schools

Next, we analyze how the distribution of physicians across the country would be affected by
the redistribution of vacancies in medical schools towards regions lacking generalist physicians. Our estimates suggest that migration costs are relatively large, so such policy could
help to keep physicians in a specific area.
Table 6 column 4 shows that the targeted creation of vacancies increases the share of
physicians in the North and Northeast countryside by more than 60%, attracting mostly
physicians from the Northeast metropolitan areas and from the Southeast countryside. As a
result, we find that opening new university vacancies in needy areas improve the distribution
of physicians by 66%.
We implement this counterfactual based on the actual expansion of vacancies in medical
schools between 2009 and 2016. In this period, the federal government expanded the number
of vacancies in public universities and extended government-funded scholarships for private
colleges (FIES Program). As a result, from 2009-2016, there were on average additional
10,341 vacancies in medical schools each year relative 1996-2008, the period the physicians
in our sample started medical school. Considering that around 40.5% of physicians graduate and remain generalist, we create a scenario where these 4,187 vacancies/year [0.405 ×
10,341] were created in a way to approximate the distribution of students to the population
distribution. We add vacancies to each region in an interactive way as to guarantee that the
regions with the lowest student-population ratio receive new vacancies first.42
We provide the cost-effectiveness of this policy when implemented in two different ways:
through the expansion of vacancies in public universities and vouchers for private universities. Considering the average cost of $13,796 for each undergraduate student in a public
university,43 the total cost of creating these federal vacancies would be $143 million.44 This
42

When we add a vacancy to one of the 52 alternatives, we randomly duplicate physicians graduated in the
region. If no physician graduated in the area we randomly duplicate a physician from the same region/CS
or region/MR, changing their place of graduation to the one where we are adding a vacancy.

cost likely underestimates the real cost as it is based on the cost per student across all
courses, and medical school is one of the most expensive programs. To produce an upper
bound to the cost of such program, we compute the cost of the program if supplied through
vouchers to private universities. We calculate that the cost of implementing this policy using
a voucher policy would be $334 million per year.45
Thus, to improve the spatial distribution of generalists by one percentage point would
cost between 2.2 and 5.0 million dollars per year using the targeted expansion of vacancies
in medical schools.

6.3

Improving health infrastructure in N/NE countryside

Our estimates suggest that physicians weigh local health infrastructures when choosing their
work place. We, thus, consider a policy that improves local medical and hospital equipment
in the countryside of the North and Northeast regions, the two most disadvantaged areas. To
implement this counterfactual, we improve the health infrastructure index by 50% in these
two regions. Table 6 column 5 shows that better infrastructure helps to attract 14% more
physicians to the targeted areas, improving the regional imbalance by 6%.
Calculating the cost of such policy is challenging. Our strategy is to obtain the cost
of a 0.1 increase in the health infrastructure index. We quantify the improvement in the
health infrastructure index in the Federal District (DF) over 2005-2012 and calculate the
total amount invested in health, excluding the wage bill.46 This accounts for fixed cost
investments in health infrastructures. However, improving infrastructures also increases the
variable operational cost of the public health system – new equipment needs additional
maintenance, and better service provision may increase demand. To capture these costs we
consider the amount spent in health investment as the fixed cost component, and the health
operational costs (i.e., the total cost minus expenses with personnel and investments) the
45

variable operational cost. We calculate that improving the health infrastructure by 0.1 in
the period costed $70.3 million per year.47
This give use that a 50% increase in the infrastructure index of the North and Northeast
regions would cost $600 million per year. Thus, investing in health infrastructure to improve
one percentage point in the distribution of physicians would cost $94.2 million per year48

6.4

Increasing wages in N/NE countryside

Last, we consider a 50% bonus on wages paid by the public sector for physicians that take
their first job after graduation in the countryside of the North or Northeast. This is likely
the most studied policy used to recruit qualified personnel to underserved areas.49 The last
column of Table 6 shows that a 50% increase in wages paid by the public sector attracts about
25% more physicians to these regions, and therefore improves the allocation of generalists
by around 12%.
The status quo public wage bill of physicians in our sample in these areas is around $1,760
million per year – considering 40 hours per week work contracts. The bonus would increase
the wage bill on $195 million per year. This means that, using such wage incentive scheme,
each percentage point improvement in the distribution of physicians would cost about $15.7
million per year.

6.5

Discussion

We close the section quantifying to which extent taste heterogeneity and demand side responses may influence physicians location choices in our counterfactuals. To quantify the
47

Between 2005 and 2012, the Federal District’s health infrastructure index increased 0.1855 for an investment of $248.1 million in health infrastructure (fixed cost). During the same period health operational costs
increased $95 million per year. We split the fixed cost over this 7-year period. This overestimates the annual
cost of the policy by effectively assuming that the new infrastructure fully depreciates in this 7-year period.
48
Note that attracting physicians is not the only consequence from improving health infrastructure, as
improved health equipment have direct effect on the quality of health provision.

This table shows the counterfactual distribution of different policy simulations with and without endogenous
changes in private sector wages – “re-pricing”. Each cell shows the difference in the counterfactual allocation
with re-pricing as in Table 6 and the distribution of the respective policy without re-pricing – i.e., holding
private wages constant. We use the random coefficients model with a control function and 150 draws.

importance of (observable) taste heterogeneity on the geographic distribution of physicians,
we simulate the geographic distribution of physicians assuming that they have the same preferences as physicians graduated from the worst ranked medical school. The quadratic error
considering the tastes of graduates from the worst school is 0.58, very close to the benchmark quadratic error of 0.57. This indicates that changing the quality of physicians’ training
would not produce a major change in the distribution of physicians across the country.
In our model, private wages may respond to public wages and exogenous changes in
observed characteristics of any region. The possibility of “repricing” may have implications
on average wages and, therefore, on the counterfactual equilibrium distribution of physicians.
We illustrate the effects of “re-pricing” on the results of the four counterfactual policies we
examined. To do this we calculate the distribution of physicians holding private wages fixed
at the initial level – i.e., we switch off the possibility of “repricing”. Table 7 presents the

39

difference between the counterfactual geographic distribution of physicians in Table 6 with
the counterfactual distribution without “re-pricing”. We see that in all policies considered,
“re-pricing” reduce the number of physicians going to countryside and increase the number
of those choosing to work in the metropolitan regions. Column 1, for example, shows that
private sector responses to the quota policy increases 0.71% the share of physicians choosing
to work in the metropolitan areas of the North region and reduces 0.19% the share of those
choosing the Northern countryside.
The last row in the table shows the variation in quadratic errors of the distribution of
physicians due to “re-pricing”. We find that, in our setting, “re-pricing” has little effect
on the equilibrium distribution of physicians. Private wages respond to a relatively small
fraction of average wages and, therefore, the effects of changes in private wages on average
wages in that region will be small. Second, because cross and own average wage elasticities
are low and because the number of competing regions is relatively large, changes in average
wages in a given region will not cause major changes neither in the aggregate supply of
physicians to that region nor in private wages of health facilities in other regions.

Conclusion

We exploit revealed preferences of all generalist physicians graduated in Brazil between 2001
and 2013 to estimate a regional demand and supply model of generalist physicians. We
have detailed information on physicians characteristics – including the quality of the school
from which they graduated –, practice location choices and attributes of these choices. Our
estimates indicate that physicians tend to stay in the same area as where they were born or
completed medical school. These two types of geographic biases are much more important
to explain physicians’ location choice than wages or quality of health infrastructure.
We estimate the structural model and use it to simulate the effects of different policies on
the geographic distribution of physicians in Brazil. Our back-of-the-envelope cost calcula-

40

tions suggest that policies exploiting physicians’ home bias and place of graduation bias are
the most cost-effective. Affirmative action policies in the form of quotas on student enrollment aimed at increasing the proportion of students born in underserved areas in medical
schools appear to greatly improve the geographic distribution of physicians at little cost.
The opening of new vacancies in medical schools in areas lacking generalist physicians is
also cost-effective. Increases in public wages for physicians in needy areas also appear to be
effective, but at a much higher annual cost than the two previous policies.

Health Provision and Health Outcomes

This subsection provides descriptive evidence on the correlation between health provision
and health outcomes in Brazil. Figure A1 tabulates a few measures of access to healthcare
and health outcomes in rural and urban areas in Brazil from Pesquisa Nacional de Saúde
(PNS) and the Mortality Information System (SIM/Datasus). Figure A1a shows that those
living in rural areas are about 38% more likely to not have been to a Doctor’s appointment
in the last 12 months than those living in urban areas. Figure A1b indicates that infants
in rural areas are about 20% less likely to visit the Doctor in the first 30 days of life, and
about 50% more likely to not have gone through seven prenatal care visits (the recommended
by the Brazilian Ministry of Health) than infants in urban areas. This difference relates to
higher infant mortality rates in rural areas. Figures A1c and A1d also point that men over
50 years old in rural areas are more likely to stay more than three years without a DRE
exam (rectal examination), and that people in these areas are more likely to have more than
three years since the last blood glucose exams than those in urban areas. These exams are
important for early detection of prostate cancer and diabetes, respectively, and lower access
may be one factor underlying the higher prostate cancer mortality rate and hospitalization
because of diabetes in rural areas than in urban ones.
While the descriptive evidence from Figure A1 suggest that rural areas tend to have lower
access to healthcare and worse related health outcomes than in urban areas, we cannot infer
any causal relationship from them. To get finer evidence on the relationship between the
presence of Doctors and local health outcomes, we correlate the number of physicians per
capita and infants’ health outcomes across Brazilian municipalities between 2005 and 2016
using a linear regression model in Table A1. The table presents three indicators of infants
and women health outcomes: share of infants born with less than seven prenatal care visits
in Panel A, infant mortality rate in Panel B, and maternal mortality rate in Panel C. All
regressions include a constant and year fixed effects.
We derive some stylized facts from this exercise. First, we find a positive correlation
between physicians per capita in a given municipality-year and infants/mothers’ health outcomes. Column 1 presents the raw correlations which are statistically significant at one
percent for our three variables. Column 3 show that these correlations do not disappear or
loose statistical significance when add state fixed effects and compare municipalities within
states. Second, this correlation does not seem to come from a rural versus urban comparison. Columns 2 and 4 show that adding a countryside fixed effect almost do not affect
the point estimates of the correlations between the number of doctors and health outcomes
estimated in columns 1 and 3, respectively. The relationship gets weaker, however, when we

A2

add municipality fixed effects in Column 5. This may be driven by other local characteristics
relevant for infants’ health but also by small variation in the number of physicians within
underserved municipalities over the decade.

This table shows the difference in means between physicians we could match to a working
region up to three years after graduation and the ones we could not. We believe most of our
losses were due to: (i) Misspelling and errors in the names and dates of birth; ; (ii) RAIS
and CNES having less accurate registries in their early years; (iii) Physicians which only
work shifts up to 24 hours in hospitals, and A6
A&E departments. The two major differences
are in gender and graduation year. We believe more women were not matched because in
Brazil it is quite common for them to include their husbands’ surname after getting

This table shows the fitting of the aggregate supply of physicians using the estimated parameters from the
random coefficients logit with control function. Column 1 shows the distribution of physicians as observed
in the data. Column 2 reports the number of physicians in each geographic region as predicted by the
model. Column 3 has the frequency of physician choices that were correctly predicted by the model. The
predictions are obtained by assuming each physician chooses the region that has the highest predicted
probability. Although the results are shown using ten aggregated regions, the correctly predicted frequencies
were calculated by assessing the 52 alternatives. Columns 4 (5) is the ratio between column 2 (3) and column
1. Sample size: 46,989. We take 10,000 draws from the estimated normal distributions to evaluate the choice
of each physician.

Supplementary Descriptive Evidence

This appendix provides supplementary tables and evidence that complement Section 3. Table
A2 shows that physicians in our sample (matched) are not systematically different from the
ones we lose when merging the different data sources (not matched). Most of our losses were
probably due to: (i) misspelling and errors in the names and dates of birth; (ii) RAIS and
CNES having less accurate registries in their early years; (iii) physicians which only work
shifts up to 24 hours in hospitals, and A&E departments. In Table A2 we find that the
two major differences are in gender and graduation year. We believe more women were not
matched because in Brazil it is quite common for them to include their husbands’ surname
after getting married. As for graduation year, we believe our match is better in later years
because RAIS and CNES databases improved over time. The other variables do not show
high differences. More details about the merge process can be found in Appendix D.
Figure A2 shows a strong correlation between physicians’ wages in formal and informal
jobs. Figure A2 and Table A13 display the living costs we use (see Appendix D for details).
Table A14 presents the transition matrix of physicians’ practice location choice just after
graduation and practice location 5 years later.
We also estimate some correlations between local attributes and the geographic distribution of physicians in Brazil by regressing
yjt = α + βXjt−1 + γj + δj × t + εjt

(14)

where yjt is the number of new generalist physicians (per 1,000 people) that chose their first
job in state-region j (i.e., metropolitan areas or countryside) in year t, Xjt is a vector of
local covariates in year t − 1, γj is state-region fixed effects, and δj are state-region specific
trends. We estimate this equation with and without population weights. To account for
potential endogeneity of wages and filled job positions, we also instrument local wages using
local characteristics in the neighboring regions – we describe the instrument in greater detail
in section 4.3.50
The first five columns of Table A15 present the OLS estimates. We see that higher wages
are positively associated with the number of physicians starting to work in the area. The
estimates also show that other local characteristics influence the number of physicians choosing to go to the area. As columns 3 and 4 show, better local amenities, health infrastructure
and the percentage of medical school generalist students graduating in that area contributes
50

These are the same type of instruments as proposed in Berry et al. (1995). See also Nevo (2000) and
Petrin and Train (2010).

to attract more new graduates to that region – both across and within state-region.51 The
results from the specification without population weights (column 5) is qualitatively similar.
Our instrumental variables estimates – shown in Table A15 columns 6 to 10 – tell a
similar story. Again, local characteristics play an important role in physicians choice. While
the specification with no local controls suggests that higher wages attract fewer physicians,
this relationship changes when we account for local fixed characteristics (column 7) or when
we control for other local time-varying characteristics (column 8 to 10). The coefficients associated with these local characteristics have roughly similar magnitude in the instrumented
and OLS specifications. The coefficient attached to wages, instead, increases substantially
in comparison to the OLS coefficients. This finding suggests that wages are negatively correlated with unobserved local attributes: places with better unobservable characteristics can
attract more physicians paying relatively lower wages.
Differently from the linear regression shown above, the structural model in the paper
accounts for both local and individual characteristics, preference heterogeneity and spatial
correlation across locations. As it will be shown in the following sections, these elements are
important determinants of physicians’ locational choices.

51
As discussed above, the negative coefficient of the stock of physicians per capita suggest that physicians
avoid areas with greater competition.

Figure A2: 2010 Living Cost Index
This graph shows our 2010 living cost estimates for each state/(countryside or metropolitan region) using
the 2010 Census. We chose the Federal District as the omitted state in the regressions, so its index is zero.

Figure A3: Average Labor Income by contract Type
This graph shows the average labor income of physicians in Census 2010 (under 35 years old) by region
(countryside/metropolitan region) and by type of contract: formal or public sector jobs, and other forms of
contracts (e.g., self-employed or informal). We see that average wages in other forms of contract is highly
correlated with average public and private sectors wages.

This table shows the living cost estimates for each one of the 52 regions analyzed in this study. We chose
the Federal District as the omitted State in the regressions, so its index is zero. The higher the value,
the higher the living cost in the region. Our Metropolitan Region definition also includes the capital of
each State.

This table describes practice location of physicians who graduated between 2001 and 2009 just after graduation and five years later. Each cell (i, j) in the table has the fraction of physicians who started working
in region i (row) just after graduation – metropolitan areas (including capitals) and countryside for the 5
Brazilian geographic regions – that worked in region j (column) five years after graduation. The table shows
persistency of practice location, especially for those who initially chose to work in metropolitan areas.

This table presents the results of linear regressions of generalist physicians practice choice per 1,000 people (mean 0.019) on average hourly wage and other covariates. Unit of observations is state-region (i.e.,
metropolitan areas or countryside) by year (N=676), between 2001 and 2013. All regressions include a
constant and state-region trends. Columns 1 to 5 present OLS estimates and columns 6 to 10 present 2SLS
estimates instrumenting wages with neighbors’ amenities, health infrastructure, health insurance indices and
physicians per capita (as described in section 4.3). Regressions estimated using population weights, except
columns 5 and 10. Section 3 describes the variables used. Columns indicated with State-Region FE include
state-region fixed effects. Standard errors clustered by state-region (52 clusters) in parentheses. *** p<0.01,

Data Appendix

We now describe the data sources and data cleaning in detail.

D.1

Organizing CFM database

Fix manually observations that are wrong in the following variables: med-school graduation
year, registry year in CFM, registry cancellation year in CFM, birth year, state of birth, city
of birth and medical school name. Ex: 006 is 2006 in med school-graduation-year
Recover missing values for variables: med-school graduation year, medical school name,
city of birth, state of birth and birth year. Since some physicians have more than one record
(work in more than one state), if an information is blank in one of their records but not in
the other we might be able to recover it. This recovery is based mainly on physicians full
name. Until now no record was deleted. We have 637,058 records, and 459,740 physicians
(uniquely identified by full name 52 ).
Keep only physicians that graduated between 2001-2013. Among the records deleted in
this step, 2.6% were because medschool_gradyear was missing (16,634/637,058). Considering people with birth year up to 1971 (beginning med-school with 30 years in 2001, a conservative measure) and records that have both birth-year and medschool_gradyear missing
we have that we wrongly deleted at most 4,602 observations. Records: 221,240. Physicians (uniquely identified by full name): 153,569. Records that might have been wrongly
deleted: 4,602. Physicians (uniquely identified by full name) that might have been wrongly
deleted: 4,599. Keep only physicians that were born and did their medical school in Brazil.
Records: 219,925. Physicians (uniquely identified by full name): 152,799. Only 770 physicians (uniquely identified by full name) were deleted.
Important variables for us: full name, birth year, gender, city of birth, state of birth,
medical school name, medical school state, graduation year. Delete the duplicates in terms
of these variables. Records: 171,068. Physicians (uniquely identified by full name): 152,799.
Physicians(uniquely identified by full name and birth year): 153,109. We have 310 homonyms
physicians that graduated between 2001 and 2013. Since we have very feel we will use only
the full name to identify physicians.
Delete observations that have missing birth year, medical school name or city of birth.
We lost 3,162 physicians (uniquely identified by full name) because of missing values. It
represents 3162/152799=2.1% of our database. Records: 163,588. Physicians (uniquely
identified by full name): 149,637. According to SIGRAS/INEP, there are 149,002 physicians
graduating between 2001-2013, our final database of physicians is very close to it.
52

We took all the special characters and spaces from names in order to minimize typos problems

A25

Keep only one record per physician. Criteria used was to first consider records that
are ACTIVE and then the PRINCIPAL records. Records: 149,637. Physicians (uniquely
identified by full name): 149,637.
Merge birth and medical school cities’ names with their codes provided by IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics).
Merge birth and medical school cities’ code with identifiers of metropolitan regions in
each state provided by IBGE. Our definition of metropolitan region will also incorporate the
capital of each state. Countryside will be defined as the cities that are neither state capitals
nor belong to metropolitan regions.
Merge with ranks of university courses published by Folha de São Paulo newspaper
in 2013. Gama Filho University was closed by the Ministry of Education because of its
low academic quality and the serious impairment of its economics and financial situation.
Because of that we imputed its ranking as last in our database. Create an excel file with the
counts of our final database (CFMcontagemfinal.xls).

D.2

Merge between CFM and CNRM databases

Merge with CNRM was done in three steps: Exact merge using full name and registry
number in CFM; (ii) Exact merge using full name; and (iii) Probabilistic merge using full
name (2,292 were merged here). We do not consider merges with the following inconsistency:
if the beginning of the residency occurs before the med-school graduation date. Homonyms
or wrong probabilistic merge gives us 1,332 records or 669 (0.45%) physicians that did not
do medical residency but in our database appear as if they did. We cleaned these wrong
observations.
We have that 59,450 (40.2% out of 149,637) physicians finished medical residency (until Aug 2014). All specialist physicians were dropped leaving us with 90,187 generalists
(uniquely identified by full name).

D.3

Organizing RAIS database

First we select in RAIS (we have data from 2001-2015)53 the physicians, ie, the observations with the following Brazilian Occupational Codes (CBO): 2002 CBOs beginning with
2231, 2251, 2252, 2253 and 234453, this last one begin medicine professor; and 1994 CBOs
beginning with 0.61 and 13770, this last one being professor of occupational medicine.
53

We had a problem with the CBO of the 2001 identified data provided to us by the Ministry of Labor,
so we did not use it to find physicians work city. When constructing the wages, we used the 2001 nonidentified data available online at ftp://ftp.mtps.gov.br/pdet/microdados/RAIS/2001/, which did not have
this problem.

A26

Remove spaces and special characters from physicians’ full name. Then we recover missing name, date of birth, race and gender using the physicians’ social security number (known
in Brazil as CPF) and PIS (Social Integration Program) number used by the Ministry of
Labor to identify workers in the database.
Define as missing value the zeros that appear in working hours, remuneration, birth date,
CPF and PIS.
Merge with deflator and convert remuneration variable to 2010 reais and divide it by
working hours creating a remuneration per hour variable.
Create our own age variable which is based on RAIS year of birth (available for years
2002-2010) and on RAIS age (available for 2001 and 2011+)
Identify the cities that belong to metropolitan regions or are capitals using IBGE classification.
Merge with population data by municipality-year provided by IBGE.
Keep only the first employment relationship of each physician.
Keep only one choice per physician. Around 17% of physicians in our database chose to
work in more than one of our 52 regions in the same year. For those we picked the region
that physicians worked more hours.

D.4

Organizing CNES database

Keep only professionals classified as physicians: 2002 CBOs beginning with 2231, 2251, 2252,
2253
Create a variable identifying physicians that are enrolled in a medical residency program:
We identify them through CBO 2231F9 and the employment relationship variable in CNES.
Identify the cities that belong to metropolitan regions or are capitals using IBGE classification.
Keep only the first employment relationship of each physician.
Keep only one choice per physician. Around 17% of physicians in our database chose to
work in more than one of our 52 regions in the same year. For those we picked the region
that physicians worked more hours.

D.5

Merge CFM generalists with RAIS and CNES

Now we want to find the city each generalist physician is working after graduation. We will
search for them both in RAIS and CNES.
We start with RAIS performing an exact merge using physicians full name and birth
year. We disconsider merged observations in which graduation year > year found working
A27

in RAIS. 51,446 physicians (57.0%) were merged with RAIS.
Second, we perform an exact merge with CNES using physicians’ full name. We disconsider merged observations in which graduation year > year found working in CNES. CNES
informs which physicians are currently a training medical resident in that health facility.
We use this information to exclude from our database another 29,624 physicians that are
enrolled in a medical residency program, leaving us with 60,563 generalist physicians. In our
merge with CNES, we found 56,213 (92.8%) generalist physicians.
When we take both datasets into consideration we were able to find 57,195 (94.4%)
physicians at some point in time. We decided to keep only physicians we could see the
place of work up to 3 years after graduation, which left us with our final database of 46,989
generalist physicians. We do not consider these physicians because we cannot assure these
regions were their first location choice after medical school. Table A2 shows the comparison
between physicians found in RAIS or CNES up to three years after graduation and physicians
lost in the merge process.

D.6
D.6.1

Construction of the Amenity Index
Transport Index

Data related to the fleet in Brazil. Information came from DENATRAN. We used the fleet
information by municipality for December of each year. Appended all the information. All
the administrative regions of Brasilia were considered just as Brasilia city (summed them).
Data was collapsed (sum) to the UF/(countryside or metropolitan region & capital) level.
Data was merged with IBGE database containing population per municipality-year. We
constructed four variables: Bus per 1000 people (includes bus and shuttle); Cars per 1000
people (includes cars and pick-ups); Motorcycle per 1000 people. Since we don’t have this
data for 2000 in the municipality level, we used the information of 2001 in 2000.
Data on Traffic Deaths. Data came from DATASUS/SIM. Death was collected by city
of death and year. ICD for traffic accidents: V01-V99. Data was collapsed (sum) to the
state/(countryside or metropolitan region & capital) level. Data was merged with IBGE
database containing population per municipality-year. We created the variable traffic deaths
per 1,000 people
Data on Establishments from RAIS. We obtained the number of establishments by municipality/year (2000-2015) with the following National Classification of Economic Activity
(CNAE 2.0 or 1.0, depending on the year): CNAE 2.0: 49-51, 55, 56, 90, 92, 91 and 93;
CNAE 1.0: 60-62, 55.1, 55.2, 92.3, 92.5, 92.6. We classified these establishments in the following way: Transport by land, water and air, all together: CNAE 2.0 is 49-51 and CNAE
A28

1.0 is 60-62; Hotels: CNAE 2.0 is 55 and CNAE 1.0 is 55.1; Restaurants: CNAE 2.0 is 56 and
CNAE 1.0 is 55.2; Entertainment: CNAE 2.0 is 90-93 and CNAE 1.0 is 92.3, 92.5 and 92.6.
Data was merged with IBGE database containing population per municipality-year. Data
was collapsed (sum) to the state/(countryside or metropolitan region & capital) level. We
created the variable number of establishments per 1,000 people for all the types described
above. We have bad data for the state of Pernambuco in 2002 (zero establishments). So I
interpolated this year’s value for all establishments variable with 2001 and 2003 information.
How we constructed the transportation index. We merged information of fleet, establishments and traffic deaths at the state/(countryside or metropolitan region & capital) level.
The index was created using the KKL method: normalize each variable that will be included
in the index, than calculate their average. Variables used in the index: Transportation Establishments per 1000 people (DENATRAN); Buses per 1000 people (RAIS); Cars per 1000
people (RAIS); Motorcycles per 1000 people (RAIS); Traffic Deaths per 1000 people (SIM).
D.6.2

Violent Deaths

Data came from DATASUS/SIM. Death was collected by city of death and year. The
ICD-10 codes used to classify violent deaths are the ones used in the National Violent
Death Reporting System for Deaths (≤ 1year), excluding suicides and terrorism: Assault
(homicide): X85-X99, Y00-Y09; Event of undetermined intent: Y10-Y34; Unintentional
exposure to inanimate mechanical forces (firearms): W32-W34; Legal Intervention: Y35.
Data was collapsed (sum) to the Sate/(countryside or metropolitan region & capital)
level. Data was merged with IBGE database containing population per municipality-year.
We created the variable violent deaths per 1,000 people.
D.6.3

Entertainment Index

Data on movie theaters from ANCINE. There is only information about the number of
movie theater rooms per city from 2007 on. Between 2000-2006 we did a projection using
the evolution of the total number of rooms between 2000-2006 (the national data exists since
1971) and the proportion of rooms each city had in 2007. We kept these proportion the same
and adjusted for the national total provided in the period. Data was collapsed (sum) to the
state/(countryside or metropolitan region & capital) level. Data was merged with IBGE
database containing population per municipality-year. We created the variable number of
cinema rooms per 1,000 people.
Data on Establishments. We described how we obtained hotels, restaurant and entertainment establishments per capita in the section we explain the transport index

How we constructed the entertainment index. We merged information of cinemas and
establishments at the state/(countryside or metropolitan region & capital) level. Created
an entertainment index using KKL method: normalize each variable that will be included in
the index, than calculate their average. Variables used in the index: Restaurants per 1000
people (RAIS); Hotels per 1000 people (RAIS); Entertainment Establishments per 1000
people (RAIS); and Cinemas per 1000 people (ANCINE).

Education

We use the Index of Development of Basic Education (IDEB) in Brazil. IDEB is an indicator
of the quality of education that combines information from the performance of students in
national assessments at the end of school levels of basic education (4/5th, 8/9th and 11/12th
grades) with flow rates. This index started in 2005 and is released every two years.
Data was merged with IBGE database containing population per municipality-year. Data
was collapsed (mean) to the UF/(countryside or metropolitan region & capital) level using
population weights. Then data for the years 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014 were interpolated. Data for 2000-2004 were set as being equal to 2005.
D.6.5

Public Investment

Data on public expenditures by state and city comes from. Only one city has missing information in one year (290430). We interpolate. Data was merged with IBGE database containing population per municipality-year. Data was collapsed (sum) to the state/(countryside or
metropolitan region & capital) level. We created two variables: state investments per capita
and City investments per capita. Values were deflate data to 2010 reais.
The index was created using the KKL method: normalize each variable that will be
included in the index, than calculate their average. Variables used in either index: State
investments per capita; and Cities investments per capita.
D.6.6

Amenity Index

The amenity index was created using the KKL method. Variables used in the index: Entertainment Index; GDP per capita (data obtained at the year-municipality level at IBGE
website); Education Index; Transport Index; Violent Deaths per Capita; and Public Investment Index.

Construction of other regions’ characteristics
Physicians per capita

Data from CNES, 2005-2016 (December). The ratio of total physicians per 1,000 people was
calculates for each region. Data from 2000-2004 was imputed as being the same as 2005.
D.7.2

Health Insurance

Data is from the National Regulatory Agency for Private Health Insurance and Plans (ANS).
Data from December each year 2000-2016, no imputation. We drop observations in which
the beneficiary municipality is not know inside the state (last four digits in the city code
are equal to “0000” or city code is equal to zero). This is less than 1% of total beneficiaries
between 2000-2016. We divide the number of beneficiaries by the population and obtain the
health insurance coverage of each region. One person might be the beneficiary of more than
one health insurance plan. He/she will be doubled counted. But this is how ANS calculates
health insurance coverage.
D.7.3

Health Infrastructure Index

Data from CNES, 2005-2016 (December). Diagnoses and imaging equipment obtained: mammographs, ultrasound machines, x-ray machines, computed tomography (CT) scanners and
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners. We calculate the number of each one of these
equipment per 1,000 people in each region. Data from 2000-2004 was imputed as being the
same as 2005. The index was constructed using these five rates and the KKL method.
D.7.4

Physicians Wage per Hour

We keep the records where: 2002 CBO is 225170 and 223129 (generalist physician) or 225125
and 223115 (clinic physician); and 1994 CBO is 0.6105 (General physician). We deflate average remuneration values to 2010 reais. Using working hours we construct the remuneration
per hour in 2010 reais. Data is collapsed to a countryside/metropolitan region weighted
by city population. We construct two variables: one with the average remuneration of all
generalists (data described in steps above) and average remuneration of recently graduated
physicians (age ≤ 35 years) The public sector encompasses establishments with legal nature
defined as either 1 (public administration) or 201-1 (public enterprise). The private sector
include all the other establishments.

Construction of the Living Cost Index

The living cost index was constructed following Summers (1973) and Seabra and Azzoni
(2015).54 Below we describe step by step how to construct it. We use PNAD and Datazoom
from PUC-Rio to make the variables compatible over time. Organizing PNAD database to
run living-cost regression. Keep only the household living arrangements classified as "permanently individual". Delete the collective and temporary individual arrangements (v0201
== 1). Keep only the following household settings (variable v4105 <=3): "Urban - urban
area", "Urban - non urban area" and "Urban - isolated area" . We focus only on households
in the urban area because we understand that the real estate market of rural areas may not
represent the dynamics of local living cost.
Construct two variables: "Number of children up to 24 years in the household" and
"Number of children over 24 years old in the household". We use variables v8005 (age in
years) and v0403 == 3 (to focus only on son/daughter).
Keep only the heads of household in the sample (variable v0401 == 1).
Create a dummy for rented households (v0207 == 3). Construct variable ln(Monthly
Rent) using variable v0208 and deflate it to 2010 reais. Calculate the number of apartments
(using variable v0202==4) per State and the number of houses per state (using variable
v0202==2), remembering to weight by the household sampling weight (variable v4611).
With these two information I calculate the rate "Number of houses/Number of Apartments"
by state. We will use variables: v0105: number of people in household; v0206: number
of rooms used for sleeping; v2016: number of bathrooms (in 2001 we do not have this
information only a dummy if there is a bathroom or not); and v0205: number of rooms.
Create the auxiliary variable "Total number of households" by state summing the variable
v4611 (household sampling weight). Create the variable "Proportion of rented households
in the state" using variables v0207 and "Total number of households". Create the variable
"Proportion of households classified as slums in the state" using variable v0203 (main material
used on walls, which need to be 1 "brickwall") and "Total number of households". Create
dummy for households connected to sewage (v0217 - sewage treatment, which needs to
be either 1 "sewage system" or 2 "septic tank with drain", 0 otherwise). Create variable
"Proportion of households connected to sewage in the state" using variable v0217 (sewage
treatment, which needs to be either 1 "sewage system" or 2 "septic tank with drain", 0
otherwise) and "Total number of households". Create dummy for households in which garbage
is collected directly or indirectly (v0218==1 or v0218 == 2). Create dummy for households
in which the energy source used for lightning is eletric - network, generator or solar (v0219

young (between 17 and 29 years old), adult (30 years or more) or old (60 years or more) using
variable v8005; Dummy if lives together with another person (v4111); Dummy if married

mother with children, other (v4723) - in all of these types of family can exist other parents,
housekeepers, etc; Dummy if was born or not in the municipality (ie, if migrant or not)
(v0501); Dummies for time living in the municipality (considering both people that were
and were not born in the municipality: up to four years (v5061 == 2 | v5121 ==2), 5-9
years (v5063 == 4 | v5123 == 4), 10 or more years (v5065 == 6 | v5125 == 6); and
Dummies for the mean income: class E, mean income <= 1085 reais; class D, between
1086-1734 reais; class C: between 1735-7475 reais, class B: 7476-9745 reais.

1735-7475 reais), class B (7476-9745 reais). The predicted values from the equation above
are retained to calculate inverse mills ratio.
OLS using only the sample of rented houses. Dependent variable: ln(rent value). Independent variables: inverse mills ratio; dummies for each state/(countryside or metropolitan
region & capital) (DF dummy will be the one dropped); number rooms used for sleeping;
number of bathrooms (in 2001 we do not have this information only a dummy if there is
a bathroom or not); number of rooms; main material used on walls (1 if brick wall, zero
otherwise). Weight the regressions by household weights. Also run this regression with state
dummies instead of state/(countryside or metropolitan region & capital).
Constructing the living cost index using the state dummies and the state/(countryside
or metropolitan region & capital) dummies obtained from regressions above. The steps
above using the 2010 Census data provides living cost indexes for each state as a whole,
and its "metropolitan region + capital" (MR) and countryside (CS). The ideal would be for
us to have this set of indexes in every year. But unfortunately the 2000 Census don’t have
rent information and the smallest representative unit of analysis in PNAD is the states and
metropolitan regions. So using the living cost indexes obtained through 2010 Census we
calculate, for each state, how bigger or smaller are the MR and CS indexes when compared
to the one related to the whole state. We will assume that these ratios are the same in every
year. This means that if in 2010 the countryside of Rio has a living cost index that is 2/3
of the living cost in the whole state, we will assume that this ratio is maintained in all the
other years.
Using the PNAD data and the methodology above, we were able to calculate living costs
indexes for the every state as a whole. Then we use the ratios calculated with the 2010 Census
to estimate the living costs in 2001-2009 and 2011-2015 for the MR and CS of each state.
The 2000 living cost index was assumed to be the same one as 2001. Now a higher index
means higher living cost. Graph A2 shows the index calculated for at the state/(countryside
or metropolitan region & capital) level using 2010 Census and Table A13 details our final
living cost index for each region from 2001-2015. We then invert the logic, so the highest
number represents the lowest living cost, and normalize the index to be between 0 and 1.
The wages per hour (in 2010 reais) are multiplied by this index to adjust it for the local
power purchase.
