ABSTRACT
In the digital economy, innovation processes increasingly rely on highly specialised know-how
and open-source software shared on digital platforms on collaborative programming. The information that feeds into the content on these platforms is provided voluntarily by a vast crowd
of knowledgeable users from all over the world. In contributing to the platforms, users invest
their time and share knowledge with strangers to add to the rising body of digital knowledge.
This requires an open mindset and trust. In this study, we argue that such a mindset is not just
an individual asset, but determined by the local communities the users are embedded in. We,
therefore, hypothesise that places with higher levels of trust should contribute more to Stack
Overflow, the world’s largest question-and-answer platform for programming questions. In relating the city-level contributions of 266 OECD metropolitan areas to infrastructure, economic,
and trust measures, we find this hypothesis confirmed. In contrast, click rates to the platform
are solely driven by infrastructure and economic variables, but not by trust. These findings
highlight the importance of societal values in the 21st century knowledge economy: if policymakers want to develop a lively local digital economy, it is not enough to provide fast Internet
access and business opportunities. Instead, it is equally important to establish a trust-building
environment that fosters sharing of innovative ideas, collaborations, and knowledge spillovers.

1. Introduction
In the 21st century, digital platforms have become ubiquitous tools for the transfer of information
and the distribution of knowledge. Every day, millions of people consult Wikipedia, the world’s
largest encyclopedia; numerous users download open-source software from the project hosting
website GitHub, and they browse the question-and-answer website Stack Overflow to get answers
to all kinds of programming questions.
The vast amount of information that feeds into the articles, software products, and threads
on these platforms is collaboratively produced by a large crowd of knowledgeable users from
all over the world. In contributing to the platforms, the users add to the rising body of digital
knowledge. Consequently, this form of platform-enabled ’distributed innovation’ (Yoo et al.,
2012) is becoming an increasingly important element of innovation processes.1

this study, we do not claim that platform contributions are innovations, in the sense that these activities were focused

As these platform-based innovative activities happen in the digital sphere, they are in principle not bound to local knowledge clusters that characterised earlier forms of innovation. Traditionally, innovation has been concentrated in cities and metropolitan areas, where the physical
proximity of people enables a vivid informal exchange of ideas (Carlino et al., 2007; Marshall,
2009), facilitated by universities and other research institutions (Andersson et al., 2009; Lin,
2011; Forman and Zeebroeck, 2012).
While the reduced search and communication costs associated with digital technologies (Forman et al., 2018) have certainly simplified the coordination of distributed innovation, the ’Information Superhighway’ (Sawhney, 1996) has not turned the world into a ’global village’
(McLuhan, 1964). Digital knowledge production and collaborative programming require specialised know-how, and the users that are able to contribute to the platforms are embedded in
their local communities. As a consequence, the geography of platform contributions is likely to
follow the uneven distribution of economic resources, infrastructure, and human capital (Braesemann et al., 2019; Stephany and Braesemann, 2017; Graham et al., 2015).
Moreover, platform activities like collaborative programming lack formal enforcement mechanisms such as contracts or monetary rewards: the users share their knowledge voluntarily and
they invest their time to help others (Penoyer et al., 2018). We, therefore, argue that the ’social embeddedness’ (Granovetter, 1985) of users in trust-building local communities plays an
important role in understanding the geography of collaborative programming contributions.
While the role of trust in online communities has been analysed on the individual or grouplevel (Kobayashi et al., 2006; Diamant-Cohen and Golan, 2017), it has not been investigated
whether regional values of societal trust are related to the large-scale spatial patterns of digital
platform contributions.
In this study, we aim to close this gap in investigating data from Stack Overflow, the world’s
largest questions-and-answer platform for programming. We hypothesise that places with higher
levels of societal trust2 will more intensively contribute to the platform, as voluntary contributions do not only require Internet access and human capital, but also the willingness to voluntarily engage with others. In contrast, the consumption of digital knowledge does not require
specific societal values. We therefore hypothesise that the regional levels of Stack Overflow visits
should not be affected by societal trust.
To test the hypotheses, we assign more than two million users and 100 million visits to
countries and metropolitan areas, and we compare the global distribution of website traffic and
contributions on the country-level, and on the city-level for 266 OECD metropolitan areas.
The results suggest that both the highly unevenly distributed clicks and contributions to Stack
Overflow can be associated to economic and digital infrastructure imbalances, while, in line with
our theoretical framework, only contributions tend to be related to societal trust.
In the following, we present an overview of the literature on the economic geography of
innovation, on platform innovation, and on the relation to trust in section 2, from which we
derive the research hypotheses in section 3. The research design is outlined in section 4, the
results are described in section 5, and the last section concludes.
on marketable outcomes, but they are a form of digital knowledge creation. We relate platform contributions to the patentbased innovation literature, as it provides a guideline on how the geography of such activities can empirically be modelled.
2 At the same time, a society’s level of generalized trust is strongly related to societal settings, such as inequality(Stephany,
2017) or educational attainment(Stephany, 2019).

2. Related Work
Patent-based Innovation and the City
Researchers from economics, management and organisational studies have examined the geography of innovation from various perspectives (Carlino and Kerr, 2015). There is consensus that
innovation, as measured by patent activity, most often takes place in densely populated regions,
like cities or metropolitan areas (Carlino and Kerr, 2015; Carlino et al., 2007; Florida and Mellander, 2018; Forman et al., 2016). Usually, four concepts are used to explain the concentration
of innovation in cities:
First, the high density of population and employment allows to match highly skilled, specialised labour demand and supply more easily (Fallick et al., 2006; Carlino et al., 2007).
Secondly, knowledge spillovers — the informal exchange of ideas due to the physical proximity
of people — are a highly localised phenomenon (Carlino and Kerr, 2015). Innovative corporations
like Bell Labs or Google have explicitly designed their headquarters to increase the physical
interactions of people in order to use these local spillovers and to increase the exchange of ideas
(Gertner, 2012).
Thirdly, urban areas have an institutional advantage: universities and other research facilities,
which are often located in cities, explicitly encourage inventive activities and knowledge spillovers
(Carlino et al., 2007; Forman et al., 2014). For instance, Andersson et al. (2009) show how the
reallocation of universities can revitalise regional innovation, and Lin (2011) find that the degree
of urbanisation and university locations matter for local innovation.
Fourthly, cities have been found to attract and empower talent because of higher levels of
cultural openness, migration, and societal trust: Ozgen et al. (2012) report that the diversity of
immigrant communities is beneficial for inventive output in European regions. Likewise, Nathan
(2015) show that the diversity of inventor communities helps to raise individual patenting activities in the UK. Several studies find that innovation benefits from high levels of trust, strong
cooperative norms, and extended networks (Akomak and Weel, 2009; Doh and Acs, 2010; Westlund and Adam, 2010).
Platform Innovation and Digital Knowledge Creation
Today, digital technologies and, in particular, online platforms fundamentally affect how innovation processes are organised (Yoo et al., 2012). Companies that provide data and services via
platforms gain additional business opportunities, as other firms integrate these platforms in creating new products (Hauptman, 2003; Gawer, 2009). Platforms disperse the innovation process
to the periphery of organisations and towards open-source communities (Boudreau, 2010), and
they foster combinatorial innovation (Faraj et al., 2011).
While digital innovation processes differ from more traditional forms of innovation, studies
have long been solely focused on patent activity as a measure of innovation. Only recently have
scholars started to investigate platform-based knowledge creation and innovative activities, or
the emerging economic geographies associated with these phenomena.
Graham et al. (2015) map the global editing activities of Wikipedia and find that the creation of digital knowledge on the platform is determined by economic factors and Internet
infrastructure. With a focus on US metropolitan areas, Stephany and Braesemann (2017) show
that Wikipedia edit activities on topics around information and communication technologies are
3

concentrated in cities with an academic computer science department.
Likewise, open source software development contributions are geographically clustered: most
of the users of the popular project hosting website GitHub are located on the US coastlines or
in Europe (Lima et al., 2014; Takhteyev and Hilts, 2014), and the majority of user connections
take place within a 300 km radius. As with Wikipedia contributions, the global distribution
of online collaborations in software development is correlated with Internet infrastructure and
economic factors (Gonzalez-Barahona et al., 2008; Engelhardt et al., 2013). Davidson and Poor
(2018) examine the role of crowd-funding platforms in the dispersion of innovative projects in
the United States and find that online crowd-funding projects tend to be located in cultural
hubs.
The research approaches of several empirical investigations on the geography of patent-based
innovation and digital knowledge creation are summarised in Table 1. While measures on Internet
infrastructure, GDP, demographics, and the stock of human capital have been widely employed
in both strands of research, societal values or trust have so far only been considered in empirical
studies on the geography of patent activity, but not to explain platform contributions.
Table 1 near here.

Digital Platform Contributions and Trust
One important feature of platform-mediated collaborative activities is the lack of formal enforcement mechanisms (Boudreau, 2010): Collaborative digital knowledge creation is not governed by
contracts and it does not yield monetary rewards. Instead of using these market-based incentives,
the platforms establish cooperative norms of trustworthy behaviour and reputation systems as
enforcement mechanisms in order to ’socially embed’ (Granovetter, 1985) the user interactions.3
English-Lueck et al. (2002) point out that ’using technologically-mediated communication,
requires a high degree of trust’ (p. 90). In their revision of anthropological studies of the last
20 years on Silicon Valley tech-communities, they underline trust’s important mediating role:
’high-tech knowledge work is done by networks of interdependent global workers that must
share information, act under a severe time constraint, and establish effective relationships at a
distance’.
Similarly, Diamant-Cohen and Golan (2017) investigate on the role of trust in platform-based
file-sharing communities. They describe active platform contributors as members of a ’goaloriented community [. . . ] in opposition to dominant corporate platforms’ (p. 1737), and point
out that the success of peer-collaboration in the analysed communities is strongly driven by
trusting ’physically anonymous counterparts’ and solidarity.
O’Neil (2014) emphasise the fragility of trust in digital peer production in light of ’enhanced
verifiability’. Actors in such environments might be at risk of losing the trust of the community,
since the results of their work can be easily verified by the crowd (’either the computer code
runs, or it doesn’t’, p. 882).
Kobayashi et al. (2006) show that the reciprocity of generalised trust (trust emerges from
the experience of trustful collaborations) can be extended to digital interactions. Their study
of 1,300 adults in Japan exhibits that collaboration and interactions via the Internet simultaneously require and enhance ’online trust’. They find spillovers from trustful online interactions
3 For example, Wikipedia editors can gain awards for editing; on GitHub, a user’s contribution history is publicly displayed
on the profile page; and on Stack Overflow, users ’earn’ reputation points for contributions (Bosu et al., 2013).

to generalised trust in the ’offline’ world: Individuals with high levels of ’online trust’ are more
engaged in their civic society.

3. Hypotheses
Based on the literature reviewed in the previous section, we argue that the geography of
interactions with platforms of the digital knowledge economy, in this study measured by
the regional number of clicks and contributions to Stack Overflow, should be influenced by
infrastructure and economic factors. To contribute to the platform, one needs specific skills
that allow to pose unanswered questions or to reply to such questions. Users with such highly
specialised knowledge should be more likely located in places with a strong local economy and
internet infrastructure. This is captured by the first hypothesis:
H1: On the country- and city-level, contributions and clicks to Stack Overflow are positively
associated with internet infrastructure and economic factors.
Additionally, we argue that the geography of digital platform contributions do not only mirror
regional differences in economic specialisation and infrastructure, but also regional differences
in the societal attitudes towards towards trust, because people need to trust others to share
knowledge and to interact voluntarily with strangers on digital platforms. Such attitudes are
commonly measured by the generalised trust question.4 In contrast to clicks, regional levels of
contributions should thus be affected by societal trust:
H2: Places with higher levels of generalised trust contribute more to Stack Overflow than places
with lower levels of trust.
H3: This relation does not hold for clicks to the website.

4. Materials and Methods
Data Sources
To investigate the research hypotheses, we use a dataset of more than 19 million contributions
to Stack Overflow from more than two million users.5 Additionally, we collected Stack Overflow
click data from Quantcast, a platform that tracks website traffic.6
We have restricted the dataset to user contributions made in 2014 and 2015, in accordance with
the most recent completely available data sets from the World Bank (country-level controls)7 and
OECD (city-level controls).8 Information on generalised trust is retrieved from the 2014 – 2016
waves of the World Value Survey.9
4 The

level of generalised trust is measured by the share of individuals, who agree to the question ’Generally speaking, do
you think that most people can be trusted (or do you think that you can never be to careful in dealing with people)?’

Data Analysis
We provide descriptive statistics and apply multivariate regression models to test the research
hypotheses. While descriptive statistics are provided on both the national- and city-level, we
focus the inferential analysis on cities, acknowledging the importance of local geographies in
understanding innovative activities. Due to a lack of availability and comparability of demographic and economic city-level measures on a global scale, we limit this part of the analysis
to 266 metropolitan areas in OECD countries. Following the research approaches of the empirical studies on traditional and digital innovation geographies summarised in Table 1, we relate
the city-level counts of Stack Overflow contributions and clicks to population size and density,
GDP per capita, employment rate, broadband access, affinity10 , population share with at least
secondary education, age-dependency-ratio, and to the level of trust. Definitions and descriptive
statistics on all these variables are provided in Table 2 in the Appendix.
The choice of control variables in the final regression model is the result of a step-wise forward
and backward model selection procedure (see Fig. 3A in the Appendix). To validate the model,
different specifications have been compared and the robustness of the final model has been
assessed by its’ out-of-sample cross-validated prediction accuracy (Fig. 3B and 3C).

5. Results
Global Distribution of Stack Overflow Contributions and Clicks
Contributions and clicks to Stack Overflow are geographically clustered between and within
countries. Figure 1 summarises the global geographies: panel A shows the number of Stack
Overflow contributions in 188 countries (the most active city per country is highlighted by
circles of different sizes according to the per-capita contributions) and the national levels of
generalised trust (country colour). Cities with higher values of per-capita contributions are
located in Europe, North America and India, where trust on average is high. Less contributing
cities tend to be located in countries with lower levels of trust (predominantly in Africa, South
America, and East-Central Asia).
Figure 1 near here.
Contributions are very unevenly distributed between countries and cities (Fig. 1B): while
the majority of cities in the dataset have less than 250 contributions, the most active 20 % of
the cities account for nearly 85 % of all metropolitan-level contributions. Users from the three
most active cities, New York, London, and Bangalore, together (1.5 % of the cities) account for
131,000 contributions - more than all contributions of the 90 % least active cities taken together.
Such a fat-tailed distribution is typical for activity patterns of online platforms (Graham et al.,
2015; Davidson and Poor, 2018). Clicks to Stack Overflow show a similarly skewed distribution
10 Affinity describes how likely an Internet user in a given city is to visit Stack Overflow, relative to the global average of all
Internet users. For example, in a world with only two cities, A (1,000,000 Internet users and 1,000 Stack Overflow visitors)
and B (5,000,000 Internet users and 2,000 Stack Overflow visitors), city A would have an affinity value of 2.0 and city B a
value of 0.8. Thereby, affinity does not depend on the size of a city’s Internet population: it captures differences in Internet
infrastructure and general affinity of the population to use the Internet; in other words the variable is used in this study
as a normalised measure of the topical affinity to or specialisation in programming content on the Internet. This variable
should, on its own, capture a lot of the variation of Stack Overflow contributions and clicks and helps us to control for some
of the unobserved heterogeneity that is due to differences in the use of the Internet.

and closely coincide with contributions on both the city- and country level (Fig. 1C). However,
contributions and clicks are not identical.
Previous studies on digital innovation show that Internet access and GDP are important
factors for local platform activity (Graham et al., 2015; Davidson and Poor, 2018; Engelhardt
et al., 2013). We therefore compare the country contributions to Stack Overflow with affinity in
Figure 2A. The upper panel shows the Stack Overflow contributions per country grouped in the
four quartiles of each of the three variables. A clear upwards trend is visible in all three cases,
while difference between bottom and top groups are most significant for GDP: countries in the
highest GDP quartile count on average almost 100 times more contributions than counterparts
in the lowest GDP quartile.
Figure 2 near here.

OECD Cities and Robustness Checks
The observations made so far provide descriptive evidence in favour of the first hypothesis.
However, for more detailed comparisons between socio-economic regional factors and Stack
Overflow contributions, we focus on the subset of 266 OECD cities. In the lower panel of Figure
2A, the OECD cities are, again, grouped by levels of affinity, GDP, and generalised trust. Here,
in addition to affinity and GDP, quartile differences for trust are more pronounced: OECD cities
in the highest trust group have on average ten times as many contributions as metropolitan
areas in the bottom trust-quartile.
The extreme right-skewed distribution of contributions is our starting point for the selection
of a suitable regression model. An additional issue for the selection of an adequate model is that
for 22 cities no contributions had been detected. We assign zero values to these cities. In order
to normalise the outcome distribution, we apply an inverse hyperbolic sine transformation.11
In a next step, we select relevant control variables from a comprehensive list of features (Tab. 2)
in a standardised way, by performing forward and backward step-wise model selection based on
the adjusted R2 of the model (Fig. 3A). Both forward and backward step-wise model selection
yield one optimal model describing the OECD city-level contributions to Stack Overflow. The
chosen variables contain the logarithmic values of affinity, population size, population density,
GDP per capita, employment rate, and trust.
In order to validate the model specification, we compare the chosen inverse hyperbolic sine
transformed OLS model with alternative model specifications (see Fig. 3B and 3C). There are no
substantial differences with regards to the inclusion or exclusion of the zero-count cities (comparison between models 1. and 2.; and between 3. and 4.). We therefore stick to our choice of
assigning zero values to cities from which no contributions were detected. Moreover, we conclude
that the negative binomial models (3. and 4.) yield very similar results compared to the linear
models. However, the negative binomial models are less accurate in terms of cross-validated
out-of-sample prediction accuracy (Fig. 3C). By applying leave-one-out cross validation, we control for the effects of outliers and detect that the negative binomial models fail to accurately
predict extreme contribution values (Fig. 3D). We therefore conclude that the inverse hyperbolic
sine transformed model (1) is best suited to describe the number of city-level Stack Overflow
√
= log(x + x2 + 1). This transformation is an alternative to the more commonly used logarithmic transformation to
handle extreme values, but has the advantage of being defined for zero-values, see (Burbidge et al., 1988).

Regression Results
In light of the model selection procedure and robustness checks, we explain the normalised values
of Stack Overflow contributions in a linear model environment (Fig. 2B and 2C). Model (1)
shows that affinity has a strong positive association with the number of contributions. Not
surprisingly, the more likely a city’s individuals are to visit pages with programming content,
the higher their likelihood to contribute to Stack Overflow. An additional, intuitive result is
that population size affects contributions positively: the larger a city’s population, the higher
the number of contributions. The negative coefficients for population density and employment
rate appear counter-intuitive at first sight. However, both coefficients are likely to be driven by
two ’outlier’ countries: Japan and Korea are both densely populated and enjoy high employment,
but they show relatively low levels of Stack Overflow contributions. Economic output, on the
other hand, is positively related to contributions. Lastly, the level of generalised trust shows a
positive association with city-level contributions. Besides aspects of infrastructure, population
or economic characteristics, cities with higher levels of trust, tend to contribute more to Stack
Overflow. These findings confirm our first two research hypotheses.
Figure 2B moreover relates clicks to Stack Overflow to city-level characteristics in model (2),
which has also been optimised by step-wise model selection. While the model yields similar
results, trust is not selected as a substantially explanatory variable. In model (3), we have
included trust as additional factor, but neither is the variable statistically significant, nor does
it improve explanatory power in terms of R2 . This finding is in line with our third hypothesis:
As clicks to Stack Overflow represent only an individual act of digital knowledge consumption,
they are not affected by cooperative norms, such as generalised trust.12

6. Conclusion
Online platforms have given rise to a new form of decentralised, re-combinatorial, and collaborative form of innovation. Thereby, many platforms rely on an open-source creation process
with no formal enforcement of collaboration, such as monetary incentives of contracts. Instead,
cooperative norms, like reputation or trust, support the networks of open-source communities.
Our work examines the Q&A coding forum Stack Overflow as an example of global open-source
collaborative programming. User contributions to the platform are identified as items of digital
knowledge production, while clicks to Stack Overflow represent digital knowledge consumption.
We have found that trust plays an important role in explaining the geography of contributions,
but not in explaining click rates.
Digital development policies, like the UN’s ’ICT for SDG13 initative’14 , underline the importance of Internet infrastructure investments for developing countries to join the global digital
12 The

conceptualisation and cross-cultural comparability of generalised trust has been criticised in the past by Sobel (2002)
and others (Stephany et al., 2017). For the case of collaborative programming activities, we were interested in the willingness
to trustworthy collaborate with strangers; a concept that we have approximated by generalised trust. In order to validate this
presumption, we run a separate analysis in which we use the share of a city’s population engaged in charitable organisations
as a control instead of trust. Similarly to the results reported here, we observe a strong relationship of charitable engagement
and contributions, while clicks and voluntary engagement are only weakly related.

knowledge economy. Certainly, broadband connectivity and local digital business opportunities
need to be improved in order for currently disadvantaged regions to catch up (Tjoa and Tjoa,
2016). However, our research findings indicate that, besides economic performance and infrastructure, societal trust is an essential ingredient in the development of an active local hub of
people willing to contribute to knowledge-building collaborative programming platforms.
Thus, for the establishment of a lively programmer community and in order to make regions
better equipped to participate in the global digital knowledge economy, policy-makers should
not only concentrate on the provision of fast Internet, but also aim to establish a trust-building,
innovation-friendly environment; one that fosters sharing of knowledge and interactions, and not
one that isolates.
Limitations
While we could not control for differences in the political environment or Internet censorship,
we speculate that such regimes will rather tend to harm the voluntary engagement of innovative
programmers on online platforms than to foster them. As the positive effects of these contributions in knowledge building are known (Moy et al., 2010; Vasilescu et al., 2013), and as building
reputation on such systems is important for a programmer’s future career (Capiluppi et al.,
2013; Penoyer et al., 2018), societies that harm trust-building might find it difficult to establish
innovative digital economies that are built on an open-source sharing culture.
Stack Overflow is certainly the world’s most referenced Q&A platform for programming, but it
is not the only forum on which programmers can exchange with each other. Some regional communities, might opt for other, smaller and potentially local, platforms to communicate between
peers. In our work, we do not claim to holistically capture all interactions between programmers
and developers from all regions of the world, but rather label Stack Overflow as the single largest
website on collaborative programming on a global scale.15

15 It could be, for instance, that users from countries where English is not so commonly used, rather prefer to use programming platforms in other languages. However, an exploratory search on www.similarweb.com, a website to measure
country-specific web traffic, conducted on in March 2019, shows that Stack Overflow is the number-one platform in the
category ’Computer and Electronics’ in 54 out of 57 countries listed on SimilarWeb. In Japan it is ranked fifth, in Russia
and Colombia ranked second. In all OECD, but Japan, it is ranked first. Considering the high correlation (β = 0.81, see
Fig. 1C) between Stack Overflow clicks and contributions, and the high popularity of the website globally and across OECD
countries, we conclude that language barriers (even if we do not control explicitly for such barriers in the analysis) should,
thus, be of minor importance in explaining the global distribution of Stack Overflow contributions.

Tab. 1. Summary of relevant empirical studies on the geography of ’traditional’ and ’digital’ forms of innovative activity: In
investigations with a focus on patents, economic controls, such as employment, income or GDP, together with measures of
population density and education, are used to model the agglomeration of innovative activity. In studies focusing on digital
innovation outcomes, broadband connectivity and GDP are most commonly used to explain the geographic distribution. Measures
on societal openness or trust have, so far, not been included in studies on the geography of digital platform contributions.

Stack Overflow Contributions

Fig. 1. (A) National levels of trust (country-colour) and Stack Overflow contributions per city (circle size; the most active city
per country is shown): Cities with higher per capita contributions tend to be located in countries with relatively high levels of
societal trust. (B) Complementary cumulative distribution functions of country- and city-level contributions (log-log scale): The
contributions are highly concentrated and follow a fat-tailed distribution - the most active eight cities (5 %) in the dataset account
for half of the total number of contributions. (C) Comparison of country- and city-level contributions and clicks to Stack Overflow:
Digital knowledge consumption (clicks) and production (contributions) are highly correlated, but not identical.

a) A statistical value, based on the global distribution of visitors of Stack Overflow. For example, San Francisco has an affinity value of
1.94, that means a given visitor to Stack Overflow is twice as likely to be from San Francisco as any Internet user chosen at random.
(Source: https://www.quantcast.com/measure/stackoverflow.com?country=US#/generalInterestsCard)
b) The generalized trust question reads ”Generally speaking, do you think that most people can be trusted (or do you think that you can
never be to careful in dealing with people)?”. In some cases, respondents are asked to answer on a Likert-Scale from 0 (no trust) to 10
(full trust). In this case, individuals, who replied with a trust level of six and higher are counted.
c) Employment rates are defined as a measure of the extent to which available labour resources (people available to work) are being used.
They are calculated as the ratio of the employed to the working age population.
d) Age dependency ratio: number of individuals older than 65 years, divided by the number of individuals between 15 and 65 years.

Fig. 3. (A) Step-wise forward and backward model selection: Both selection procedures lead to the same optimal model in which
OECD city-level contributions are explained by affinity, population, population density, GDP, employment rate, and trust. (B)
Regression models for continuous (OLS) and discrete (Negative Binomial) outcome measures: Models (2) and (4) exclude cities
without contributions. The two continuous and discrete outcome models lead to comparable results. (C) Ten-fold cross-validation
of the four models: The linear regression models outperform the negative binomial models in terms of out-of-sample prediction
accuracy (mean absolute error and pearson correlation) (D) Leave-one-out cross-validation of models (1) and (3): While the OLS
model predicts most test-observations well (R2 = 0.74), the negative binomial model fails to accurately predict large values.
