Integrating Religiosity into Fraud Triangle Theory: Empirical Findings From
Enforcement Officers
Abstract
Recently, employee-fraud has drawn extensive attention due to huge amount of losses of
various organizations. This study developed a new model of fraud risk by integrating new
elements into a fraud triangle theory. This study simultaneously analyzed religiosity and the
three elements of fraud risk factors of employee fraud committed by low and mid-level public
officials. The data collected from 120 enforcement officers indicated that religiosity is
negatively related to employee fraud. By contrast, all the three elements of fraud triangle
theory, namely, pressure, opportunity, and rationalization, are positively related to
employee fraud. These results imply that strong religiosity is crucial to mitigate employee
fraud. To minimize employee fraud, the opportunity to commit such fraud should be
reduced through strong internal control, reduction of negative rationalization, and employee
financial pressure. This study contributes to the literature by introducing a new model on
employee-fraud occurrence that is not extensively discussed, particularly in the context of
local authority in developing countries.
Keywords: Local authority; Religiosity; Fraud Triangle; Employees fraud
Introduction
One of the most obvious crimes rampantly happening all over the world nowadays is fraud
(Sharma, 2014). The Global Fraud Survey conducted by the Association of Certified Fraud
Examiner (ACFE, 2014) revealed that corruption cases entail 36.2% of total government and
public administration fraud. According to the World Bank, countries in Africa, Asia, Middle
East, Europe and Latin America show similar types of fraudulence, including procurement
fraud, collusion, kickbacks, and bribes (The World Bank, 2016). Fraud has been a worldwide
issue for a long time, notably after the collapse of famous huge profit-making companies,
such as Enron, Worldcom, Bernie Madoff, and Tyco.
In the global economic crime survey carried out by PWC in 2014, the most commonly
reported types of fraud were asset misappropriation, procurement fraud, bribery and
corruption, cybercrime, and accounting fraud. The survey also revealed that employees were
most concerned about the effects of corruption and bribery to their business (PWC Annual
Global CEO Survey, 2014). Jain and Treisman define Corruption as the acts of misuded
power of public office for personal gain (Jain, 2001 & Treisman, 2000). Political scientists
maintain that “a public official is corrupt if he accepts money or money’s worth for doing
something that he is under a duty to do anyway, that he is under a duty not to do, or to
exercise a legitimate discretion for improper reasons” (McMullan, 1961, p. 183-184).
Corruption arose from political bureacratic offices (Mashali, 2012). Hence it can be
categorized as organized or unorganized petty or grand corruption (Mashali,2012).
Meanwhile, Zakaria (2013) define petty corruption as abused of entrusted power by low and
mid-level public officials in their interaction with ordinary citizens, who often are trying to
access basic goods or services in places like hospitals, schools, police departments and other
agencies. In the meantime, Andvig and Fjeldstad (2001) categorized petty corruption as
‘street level’ form of corruption. Petty corruption usually involved low and middle level
public official who is directly interact with puplic (Poeschl & Ribeiro, 2012). Although grand
2

corruption is viewed as having a more negative impact on the economy, petty corruption,
with its small sums of money, represents, when aggregate, a substantial amount of public
resource (Shah & Schacter, 2004).
According to the Transparency Internationals in the 2011 survey, the petty corruption
has been amounted to be £554 million globally. The petty corruption is continuing to
increasing day by day. Developed country also negatively impacted from petty corruption
practices. Greece suffer losses cost in millions. In Tunisia, at least 450 million dinars $230
million) in bribes were slipped to state employees in 2013 alone according to Tnunisia
Association for public auditors (The News Arab, 2015). In the meantime, KPMG categorized
petty corruption part of theft of fund. KPMG on their fraud bribery and corruption survey
report evinced that the theft of outgoing fund was reported as the highest category fraud at
67% (KPMG 2013).
Malaysia is not immune to any global issue such as fraud, as the existing loopholes
can be exploited for the benefit of the organization (Pickett and Pickett, 2002). For example,
the Auditor General Report in 2012 indirectly expressed concern on the escalating level of
corruption cases among public sector servants, ministries, and government-linked companies.
Corruption and power abuse in the north border have increased and allegedly involve bribing
civil servants to smuggle subsidized goods from neighboring countries (Sinar Harian Online,
December 25, 2015).
Given the number of fraud cases and their respective losses to the Malaysian
economy, fraud should be accorded serious attention. For instance, the Commercial Crimes
Investigation Department (CCID) investigated 11,714 cases of white-collar crime in 2003,
involved approximately RM579 million worth of monetary value. In 2004, the number of
cases lessened to 9,899, but the amount of losses rose to RM836 million (Lim, 2005). The
amount of losses also rose slightly to RM846 million in 2008 and the number of significant
cases climbed to 17,311 (Bernama, 2009). Four years later, in 2012, white-collar criminal
activities included criminal breach of trust, embezzlement; other white-collar crimes
increased to 18,386 cases and incurred RM1.62 billion losses, and the amount climbed to
RM1.775 billion in 2013 (CCID, as cited in Mui, 2014). The figures indicate the severity of
the fraud issue in recent years.
Referring to Transperancy International report, Malaysia’s rank in the Global
Transparency Index (TI) went down to 54th place (out of 167 countries) in 2015 compared to
its 50th ranking out of 175 countries in 2014 (Transparency International, 2015). Therefore,
more initiatives must be implemented to regain the country’s image. The very basic step that
should be pursued is to identify the root to this problem. In other words, learning the motives
behind corruption and the precautions that can be conducted against corruption are very
crusial.
The famous fraud triangle theory by Cressey (1953) stated three factors leading to
financial crimes, namely, pressure, opportunity, and rationalization. Each of these factors
explain why people are committing fraud. Several studies highlighted the reasons prompting
people to commit fraud, all of which are associated with elements in the fraud triangle. Liew
et al. (2011) ranked the motivations behind white-collar crimes in Malaysia, and the first is
the belief that competitors are paying bribes to win contracts. This ranking could be
associated with the justification element in the fraud triangle. In addition, Liew et al. (2011)
classified the reasons of fraud occurrence in terms of group motivation, where the highest
3

rank went to opportunistic causes such as poor internal control, poor ethical practices, and
lack of management control by directors. On the other hand, a group of studies focused on
other potential factors that may hinder fraud. A group of scholars proposed religiosity as one
of the most prevailing factors to mitigate fraud (Akir & Malie, 2012; Amaliah et al., 2011;
Azizan & Razlina, 2015; Fariza & Salahuddin, 2015).
Hence, the present study attempts to integrate religiosity into fraud triangle theory to
investigate the factors behind corruption among local enforcement authorities in Kelantan,
Malaysia, following the introduction of the mas’uliyyah and amanah concepts among public
administrators by the Islamic Religious and Affairs Department of Kelantan in 2014. The
concept of mas'uliyyah (accountability) and amanah (honesty) are two important pillars in
ensuring the integrity of civil servants and keeping them clean from corruption (Musa, 2014).
The concept is similar to that proposed by past studies on religiosity (e.g., Akir and Malie,
2012; Baskoro, 2014; Mittroff and Denton, 1999; Said et al., 2015).
Literature Review and Hypothesis Development
Religiosity and Employees fraud
Religiosity from the Islamic viewpoint is defined as the awareness or consciousness of God
and the desire to attain balance between worldly needs and adherence to God’s commands
(Fariza and Salahuddin, 2015). Therefore, religion aims to control human’s behavior in
building fidelity and acquiescence (Ashiq, 2004). For Muslims, Islam as a religion is a
framework or pillar that improves the behavior of its believers (Jamal, 2003). Several studies
have established the importance of religion in controlling human conduct. For example, Akir
and Malie (2012) found that religious orientation is positively correlated to the job conduct of
employees, in that employees who are affiliated to religion are more observant to company
rules and regulations.
In the surah al-Mu’minun for instance, Allah has outlined the qualities of successful
believers, and among them are the ones who are faithful to their trusts and keep their
promises. In Islam, they believe that doing five-time daily prayers will restrain a Muslim
from doing anything that is against the Islamic teachings, namely, wrongful deeds. In the
Holy Quran Allah (s.w.t) says, “Recite, [O Muhammad], what has been revealed to you of the
Book and establish prayer. Indeed, prayer prohibits immorality and wrongdoing, and the
remembrance of Allah is greater. And Allah knows that which you do” (Al- Qur’an Chapter
29, verse 45).
According to Purnamasari and Amaliah (2015), fraud in the workplace will be easier
to prevented if religiosity exits. Other authors, such as Weaver & Agle (2000), Amaliah et al.
(2011), and Amaliah (2014), concluded that an individual’s attitude and behavior can be
influenced by a good grasp of religion. The Quran places high emphasis on honesty. For
example, surah al-Ahzab in verse 72, surah al-Anfal verse 27, and surah al-Mu’minun in
verse 8 indicate the importance of honesty in Islam and the prohibition of unethical,
fraudulent acts. This finding is consistent with that of Azizan & Razlina (2015), who also
found that religious workers have positive job attitudes despite facing incivility in their
workplace; such mindset means they should improve their understanding and devotion to
Islamic practices in the workplace to better deal with unethical practices. Said et al. (2015)
found that religiosity is negatively associated with the occurrence of asset misappropriation
among Royal Malaysian Police officers. Therefore, the following hypothesis if proposed:
4

H1: A negative relationship exists between religiosity and petty corruption fraud.
Pressure and Employees fraud
Cressey (1953) noted that the fraud perpetrator exhibits a non-shareable financial problem
that motivates him to commit wrongdoings. This non-shareable financial problem was later
expanded by Kranacher et al. (2011), who also included other non-financial pressures.
Findings from previous research showed the influence of pressures on fraud occurrence
(Albrecht et al., 2010; Rezaee, 2005; Widianingsih, 2013). These authors suggest that if the
pressures exist, regardless of monetary or non-monetary aspect, a person or an organization
will tend to commit fraud. In this context, Dellaportas (2013) argued that an individual tends
to get involved in fraudulent behavior to solve or reduce their financial or personal pressures.
Hernandez (2007) found that pressure on a worker and the probability to commit
fraud in the workplace are positively related, indicating that the drive to perform also raises
the tendency to behave fraudulently and allowing a benefit in salary increment. The pressure
to obtain bonuses and higher wages also has a positive influence on the practice of fraud
among employees (Hernandez, 2007).
Lister (2007) classified pressure into three categories, namely, personal pressure,
employment pressure, and external pressure. According to Lister, personal pressure is the
pressure to maintain a lifestyle budget, employment pressure is the pressure for incentives
and financial interest in the management, and external pressure consists of expectation from
the market and meeting the requirements of financial institutions’ covenants. From the
viewpoint of Murdock (2008), pressures refer to personal needs. However, pressures can be
further divided into financial, non-financial, political, and social pressures. Murdock provided
examples of financial pressures, such as housing expenditures and unforeseeable bills related
to health.
According to survey conducted by ACFE in 2012 on the most prevalent signs
indicated by fraudsters, offenders usually live beyond their means, spend money
extravagantly, and face financial distress. These findings are consistent with the subsequent
global fraud survey undertaken by ACFE in 2014, A Report to The Nations on Occupational
Fraud and Abuse, which discovered that a total of 44% fraud offenders were maintaining a
beyond-their-budget lifestyles and another 33% were struggling with financial hardships. The
same result was found from a bribery and corruption survey carried out by KPMG Australia
and New Zealand in 2012, which reported that the major factor motivating people to commit
fraud was personal financial pressure, comprising 36% of the respondents, while the
remaining 31% were equally comprised of greed and other types of pressures. Therefore, the
following hypothesis is proposed:
H2: A positive relationship exists between pressures and employees fraud.
Opportunity and Employees fraud
Many previous studies report that the perpetration of fraudulent behavior is also associated
with opportunity (e.g., Coleman, 1987; Lister, 2007; Wells, 2001). Albrecht et al. (2010)
believed that this element is a highly significant contributing factor to fraud occurrence,
especially when combined with the existence of considerable pressure. Opportunity refers to
5

the weak internal control that exists in an organizational environment (Kassem & Higson,
2012; Mui & Mailley, 2015; Wolfe and Hermanson, 2004). Insufficient supervision and lack
of duty segregation also contribute to fraud (Dellaportas, 2013). The inmates interviewed by
Dellaportas have admitted that these loopholes in the workplace are the reason for their
fraudulent acts, such as embezzlement and loan manipulation. The presence of opportunity
enables employees to think that their probability of getting caught is small and thus commit
fraud (Cressey, 1953; Albrecht, Albrecht, Albrecht and Zimbelman 2008). These findings are
consistent with the survey by PWC in 2011, which found that opportunities such as
inadequate duty segregation caused by the reduction in the number of employees caused
fraud.
Without opportunity, a fraudulent act is impossible (Coleman, 1987; Lister, 2007). In
other words, a fraudster must find some ways in which he can use his position to settle his
financial problem with a low risk of getting caught (Cressey, 1953). Opportunity is not
restricted to the position held by a person that can lead him to commit the fraud. Usually,
poor/weak internal controls in the workplace coupled with the low chance of detection will
offer an attractive opportunity for fraudulent activities (Mui & Mailley, 2015). Opportunity
was also mentioned by Wolfe and Hermanson (2004) and Kassem and Higson (2012), who
both stated that opportunity generally arises due to weak internal controls or system in an
organization. The belief that “it is impossible to get caught after being involved in fraud, and
if getting caught, it is not a serious matter” is also regarded as an opportunity in the fraud
triangle (Albrecht, Albrecht, Albrecht and Zimbelman 2008).
The KPMG Malaysian Fraud, Bribery, and Corruption (2013) Survey reported that
among the most influential opportunities in the workplace that cause fraud and unethical
conduct to take place are loopholes in the internal control, inadequate competency of the
internal audit team to detect fraud, insufficient training to build awareness on fraud, the
nature of the particular industry that is prone to fraud, failure to convey the organization’s
code of ethics and values (81%), poor example portrayed by upper-level staff (43%), and a
poor ethical culture within the organization (38%). Therefore, the following hypothesis is
proposed:
H3: A positive relationship exists between opportunity and employees fraud.
Rationalization and Employees fraud
Rationalization is recognized as the leading contributor to fraud. For example, in terms of
financial misstatements, rationalization was established as the greatest factor causing people
to be tolerant of petty theft (Kula et al., 2011). Petty theft in the study was found to be
acceptable in companies, indicating the rationalization in committing crimes by the
employees. In the fraud of asset misappropriation, Mohamed et al. (2014) also found that
almost all respondents agreed rationalization was the factor leading to fraud, especially the
sense that “others are doing it as well.” Cleff et al. (2013) stated that the adaptation of the
sense of right and wrong to fit criminal behavior by a fraudster can also be categorized as
rationalization.
In a survey taken by KPMG in 2011 in Singapore, rationalization was clearly used
widely by most first-time fraudsters because these people viewed their actions as noncriminal. A global economic crime survey carried out by PWC in 2011 on rationalization

6

revealed that 12% of the respondents believed in people’s capability to justify their actions as
the biggest risk of fraud.
According to ACFE (2014), people rationalized a crime before they committed it.
ACFE 2014 revealed that government employees or organizations that committed fraud
usually rationalized their conduct of corruption in many ways, which allowed them to
“innocently” carry out the act. They used excuses such as “bribery is our country’s culture,”
“we have no idea that the behavior is considered as bribe,” “bribery is just a way of doing
business,” “our anti-corruption programs are already sufficient,” “we are doing this as usual,”
and “there is no other way to complete this.”
This rationalization factor is therefore a complex reason people choose to do
fraudulent activities because it involves arguments that may be very judgmental. For instance,
Levi (2008) classified fraudsters who see nothing wrong in their behavior patterns to be
“slippery-slope fraudsters.” How do fraud offenders use rationalization to commit the crime?
According to Cleff et al. (2013), a fraudster will try to adapt his sense of right and wrong so
that it can fit the criminal behavior. This approach will then make the criminal behavior seem
rational and the fraudster can continue with the act without guilt.
In their study on asset misappropriation, Mohamed et al. (2014) found that almost all
respondents agreed that “others are doing it as well” to be the common rationalization used in
doing this type of fraud. Hence, rationalization influences the occurrence of fraud because
people tend to rationalize their fraudulent acts. In other words, the rationalization factor is
positively associated with employees fraud occurrence among local authority enforcement
officers. Therefore, the following hypothesis is proposed:
H4: A positive relationship exists between rationalization and employees fraud.

Methodology
Sampling and Data Collection
A total of 120 questionnaires were distributed to the Kota Bharu Municipal Council
enforcement officers, who are involved in the daily monitoring and patrolling of their
respective areas, during a monthly meeting held by MPKB. The distribution was conducted
with the permission of the head of the enforcement division. All the respondents were given
30 minutes to fill in the questionnaire and drop the completed questionnaires in the box
provided. To ensure confidentiality of the answered questionnaires, the details to identify the
respondents, such as name or staff number, were not asked.
A total of 103 answered questionnaires were collected during the event. Enforcement
officers were selected as respondents in this study because they have a high potential to be
involved with employees fraud. For instance, the responsibilities to collect fines and
compounds from the local communities who violate the rules set by the municipal council
may tempt them, because the public may offer gifts and cash to avoid paying the fines and
compounds.
Measurement of Variables

7

•

Employees fraud: Eleven items to measure employees fraud were adopted with some
modifications from Nia (2016); Said et al. (2015); Gonzales, Schofield, and Schmitt
(2005); Klockars, Ivkovich, Harver, and Haberfeld (2000); and Weisburd et al.
(2000). Respondents were asked to rate their agreement/disagreement on whether they
have experienced accepting gifts, money, benefits in kind, discount, or free foods
from any restaurant owner/community.

•

Religiosity: Yasemin (2014) suggested 11 indicators of a Muslim’s religiosity,
including belief, ritual, devotion, experience, knowledge, devotion, and consequences.
Therefore, questions were asked to measure a Muslim’s level on these indicators
among the local enforcement officers. The questions were adopted with some
modifications from the Comprehensive Measure of Islamic Religiosity used in the
previous studies of Abdullah and Al-Khalifah (1994), Shukor and Jamal (2013), and
Siguaw and Simpson (1997). These studies set out the measurement model to measure
the religiosity of an individual, such as the extent of the respondent’s religious
activities in terms of performing compulsory daily prayers, fasting, sadaqah, reciting
the holy Al Quran, and following the sunnah of the prophet.

•

Pressure: Ten questions were asked regarding the financial and non-financial
pressures faced by the respondents in fulfilling their daily duties. The questions were
adopted with some modification from Said et al. (2015), Rezae and Davani (2013),
Dellaportas (2013), Kassem and Higson (2012), and Wolfe and Hermanson (2004).
The respondents were then requested to rate their agreement/disagreement on the
financial and work pressures they had experienced.

•

Opportunity: Six questions on opportunity were adopted and modified from Nia
(2016), Said et al. (2015), Dellaportas (2013), Kassem and Higson, (2012), and Wolfe
and Hermanson (2004) to suit the environment of the local authority and the duties of
the enforcement officers themselves. The items included internal control activities,
such as the existence of supervision, monitoring, and review on work responsibility.

•

Rationalization: Six questions on rationalization were adopted from Nia (2016), Said
et al. (2015), Wolfe and Hermanson (2004), Dellaportas (2013), Kassem and Higson,
(2012), Tugas (2012), and Paul et al. (2008), with some modifications to cater to the
working environment of the local authority enforcement officers.

Model and Statistical Test
The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and cross-sectional
regression. Initially, validity of the data was tested through several standard diagnostic
procedures. The adequacy of data was tested by Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin test, normality of data
was tested by skewness and kurtosis analysis, and homoscedasticity of data was tested by Ftest and Bartlett Sphericity test. Correlation analysis was carried out to check
multicollinearity problem. Finally, the reliability of the data was tested using Cronbach’s
alpha test.
Result and Finding
Demographic Information
8

From the survey, 71 respondents (68.93%) are male, and the other 32 respondents (31.07%)
are female. In terms of age, 55 respondents are under 30 years old (53.40%), followed by
those aged 30–40 years (17.48%), 41–50 years (13.59%), and 51 years and above (15.53%).
Among the 103 overall respondents, 18 (17.48%) hold the enforcer position and 84 are
assistant enforcers (81.55%). The average monthly earnings of the majority of respondents
(71 respondents, 68.93%) ranged from RM1000 to RM2000, followed by respondents
earning from RM2001 to RM3000 (30 respondents, 29.13%), and the rest of the respondents
earning from RM3001 to RM4001 (2 respondents, 1.94%). In terms of service period, 41
respondents have served MPKB for less than a year (39.81%), while 33 (32.04%) have
served MPKB for more than five years. In terms of education level, the respondents are
mostly lower level/certificate qualified, with 77 (74.76%) respondents, followed by 13
respondents (12.62%) with diplomas, and 12 (11.65%) degree holders.
Regression Analysis
The regression showed the R-squared (R2) of 0.707, which implied that the four predictor
variables (religiosity, pressure, opportunity, and rationalization) explained 70.7% of the
variance in employees fraud (Table 1). The F-statistic (24.514) and the corresponding p-value
is significant (P<0.00001).

The first objective of the study is to investigate the relationship between religiosity
and occurrence of employees fraud. From Table 1, the factor of religiosity indicates a
significant negative relationship with employees fraud when the coefficient for religiosity is 0.151, t = -2.076, p = 0.04. As a result, H1 is supported, meaning that the factor of religiosity
has significantl influence on the occurrence of fraudulent actions specifically employees
fraud among local authority enforcement officers. The negative relationship of religiosity and
employees fraud indicates that by having a high level of religiosity, the occurrence of
employees fraud could be reduced. This findings was supported by several previous studies
like Weaver & Agle, 2000; SHRM, 2001; Akir & Malie, 2012; Purnamasari & Amaliah
2015. More importantly, this finding is very much associated with the emphasis of honesty as
well as the prohibition of unethical fraudulent acts of the religion (Quran, 33:72; 8:27 and
23:8) as Muslims should always be aware that Allah is All Knowing of their deeds.
The second objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between pressure
and occurrence of employees fraud. Table 1 indicates a significant positive relationship
between pressure and employees fraud, with the coefficient value at .146, t = 1.947, p = .054.
Hence, H2 is supported meaning that A high level of pressure promotes the occurrence of
9

employees fraud. This findings was supported by several previous studies like Rezaee, 2005;
Hernandez, 2007; Dellaportas, 2013; Mohamed et al., 2014; Dellaportas, 2013; Hernandez,
2007; Albrecht et al., 2010. Accordingly, it can be concluded that when having financially or
non-financially pressures, an individual will be at the high risk to commit fraudulent
activities.
The third objective in this study is to analyze the relationship between opportunity
and the occurrence of employees fraud. Table 1 shows the significant positive relationship
between opportunity and employees fraud with the coefficient value of 0.506, t = 7.064, p =
.00001. Therefore, H3 is supported meaning that when the level of opportunity in committing
corruption increases, the occurrence of corruption will consequently rise. This findings was
supported by several previous studies like Dellaportas, 2013; Mui & Mailley, 2015; KPMG
Malaysian Fraud, Bribery and Corruption survey, 2013.
The fourth objective in this study is to analyze the relationship between rationalization
and the occurrence of employees fraud. The table 1 demonstrates a significant positive
relationship between rationalization and employees fraud, with the coefficient value at .382, t
= 5.154, p = .000. Thus, H4 is also supported meaning that the occurrence of corruption as a
result will increase if the attempt to justify the acts of corruption increases. This findings was
supported by several previous studies like ACFE, 2014; Cleff et al., 2013; Kula et al., 2011;
Mohamed et al., 2014; Said et al., 2015; KPMG, 2011.
Diagnostic Test
Normality: The normality of data can be explained using skewness and kurtosis tests. Thus,
the tests for each variable in this study; corruption, religiosity, pressure, opportunity and
rationalisation, are being presented in Table 2 below. According to Boise (2003), if the
skewness value is close to zero, whereas the kurtosis value does not exceed 3.0, a normal
distribution of data is assumed. As the range of skewness values for all the variables were
from -0.073 to 1.37 and that of the kurtosis was from -0.041 to 1.954, all data were
considered normal.

Internal Consistency: According to Nunally (1978) and Pallant (2007), any value of 0.70 and
above will be acceptable for good measure of internal consistency. The Cronbach’s Alpha
values for employees fraud occurrence, religiocity, pressure, opportunity, and rationalization,
were recorded as high as 0.935, 0.833, 0.845, 0.795, and 0.835, respectively, which indicated
good internal consistency of data.

Multicollinearity and Correlation Analysis: Correlation examines the relationship between
two variables in a linear fashion (Coakes et al., 2008). This analysis helps identify whether
one variable is related to another. The two variables are considered highly correlated to each
other and explain the dependent variable, which will cause a multicollinearity problem if the
value of coefficient is 0.8 or 0.9, and above (Field, 2000). Table 3 shows the summary of the
results when using bivariate analysis to test the correlation between one variable to another.
The statistical results showed that the correlation values among the variables ranged from
−0.2 to 0.51. This finding indicated multicollinearity problem among the variables given that
none of the correlation was more than 0.8.

Homoscedasticity Test: The Bartlett Sphericity test was conducted to test homoscedasticity or
homogeneity of variances. The results showed that the values for employees fraud occurrence
(Chi-square= 13333, p<0.00001), religiosity (Chi-square= 534.5, p<0.00001), pressure (Chisquare= 353.44, p<0.00001), opportunity (Chi- square= 189.05, p<0.00001), and
rationalization (Chi-square= 337.3, p<0.00001) were noted to be statistically significant.
Factor Analysis: The Kaiser–Meyer–Olkin coefficient for these datasets was 0.899 for
employees fraud occurrence, 0.726 for religiosity, 0.804 for pressure, 0.736 for opportunity,
and 0.731 for rationalization, indicating that the data could be used to proceed with the
exploratory factor analysis (Hair et al., 2010). For the Principle Component Analysis (PCA)
of employees fraud occurrence has an eigenvalue of 7.211, which is more than 1, and
signalling 65.556% variance of explanation for converting into one factor. The PCA of
religiosity has an eigenvalue of 4.388, with the signalling of 43.882% variance of
explanation. The PCA of pressure has an eigenvalue of 3.94, with the signalling of 49.246%
variance of explanation. The PCA of opportunity has an eigenvalue of 2.805, with the
signalling of 56.1% variance of explanation. The PCA of rationalization has an eigenvalue of
3.382, with the signalling of 56.373% variance of explanation.
Discussion and Conclusion
The first objective revealed the significant and negative relationship between religiosity and
occurrence of employees fraud. This finding means that if an individual is religious, chances
of employees fraud in that individual in the course of fulfilling his duties will be lower. In
this instance, any kind of job that a Muslim employee does to seek Allah’s acceptance will be
considered worship. As a result, a Muslim believer will tolerate the unfavorable working
conditions that he may face, such as the pressures of long working hours, unsatisfactory
facilities, dissatisfaction with his current position, and even small salaries received during an
economic slump, because he believes the performance of the work will bring Allah pleasure
(Hassan & Muhamad, 2009). In this study, the hypothesis is supported that religiosity has a
significant impact on employees fraud among the enforcement officers of Kota Bharu
Municipal Council (MPKB). The finding is therefore consistent with Akir and Malie’s (2012)
findings regarding religiosity and job conduct as a positive relationship was found between
11

religious inclination and individual’s conduct at workplace; meaning that an individual’s
affliction to religion will reduce the level of unethical behaviour at the workplace.
The second objective is to investigate the relationship between the first element in the
fraud triangle, namely pressure, with employees fraud occurrence. As proposed in the second
hypothesis; pressure was positively related to employees fraud. In terms of pressure,
according to Cressey (1953), the fraud perpetrator has a ‘non-shareable financial problem’
that motivates him to commit the wrongdoings. On the other hand, greed, living a life more
than one could afford, high personal debts, poor credit management, personal financial loss,
as well as unnecessary financial obligations were found to be the six most prevailing
pressures that triggered fraud (Albrecht, 2012). In this study, the hypothesis was supported, in
which pressure has significant impact on employees fraud among MPKB enforcement
officers. This outcome is consistent with the conclusion in the survey conducted by
PricewaterhouseCoopers (2009), which asserted that increased incentives or pressures are the
leading contributors to increased fraud risk. It also supports the study of Voon et al. (2008),
who noted that personal financial pressure will lead to corporate crime, especially with weak
management control in the workplace.
As for the third objective, the relationship between the second element in the fraud
triangle, namely, opportunity with employees fraud occurrence, was investigated. As
proposed in the second hypothesis, a positive relationship exists between opportunity and
employees fraud. Cressey (1953) stated that a fraudster must find some ways in which he
could use his position to settle his financial problem with a low risk of getting caught. The
ways here refer to the opportunities possessed by the fraudster that can ease the conduct of
the fraudulent act. In this regard, opportunity is not restricted to the position held by a person
that can lead him to commit the fraud. Usually, “attractive” workplace conditions with poor
and weak internal controls and a low chance of detection will offer an opportunity for
fraudulent activities (Mui & Mailley, 2015). Therefore, when the level of opportunity
increases, the tendency for fraud will also increase. The present study proves that the
opportunity existing among MPKB enforcement officers gives rise to the occurrence of
employees fraud.
The fourth objective in this study is to evaluate the relationship between the third
element in the fraud triangle, rationalization, with the occurrence of employees fraud.
Accordingly, the last hypothesis proposed that rationalization is positively related to
employees fraud. This element means that a fraudster has justification that supports his action
in conducting the crime, because he sees himself as an honest person caught in a negative set
of circumstances (Cressey, 1953). Rationalization also refers to the justification made by the
fraudsters to avoid feeling guilty (Wolfe and Hermanson, 2004). There are also individuals
who are unaware that their actions are wrongful because they perceive themselves as honest
and ordinary persons who only carry out a non-criminal action. This perception also falls
under the rationalization element (Levi, 2008). In this study, the hypothesis of rationalization
is supported, in which rationalization has a significant influence on employees fraud among
the MPKB enforcement officers. The outcome is consistent with the conclusion by Kula et al.
(2011) that the most significant component in fraud is “justifications/rationalization.” They
asserted found that rationalization, such as “petty theft should just be tolerated,” is an
appealing factor indicating a problematic company culture.
Overall, the results prove that religiosity has a positive influence on employees fraud,
while the elements in the fraud triangle which comprise pressure, opportunity, and
12

rationalization, have positive effects on employees fraud among the enforcement officers of
MPKB. In this regard, this study provides evidence of the relevancy behind the introduction
of the mas’uliyyah and amanah concepts by the Islamic Religious and Affairs Department of
Kelantan on the public administrators to ensure their integrity as civil servants and keep them
clean from corruption. The concepts will help improve the employees’ religiosity and
ultimately reduce the corruption level among the officers.
