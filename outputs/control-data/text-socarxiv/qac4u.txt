Abstract
In an online Qualtrics panel survey experiment (N = 1620), we found that scientists
posting self-portraits (“selfies”) to Instagram from the science lab/field were perceived
as significantly warmer and more trustworthy, and no less competent, than scientists
posting photos of only their work. Participants who viewed scientist selfies, especially
posts containing the face of a female scientist, perceived scientists as significantly
warmer than did participants who saw science-only images or control images.
Participants who viewed selfies also perceived less symbolic threat from scientists. Most
encouragingly, participants viewing selfies, either of male or female scientists, did not
perceive scientists as any less competent than did participants viewing science-only or
control images. Subjects who viewed female scientist selfies also perceived science as less
exclusively male. Our findings suggest that self-portraiture by STEM professionals on
social media can mitigate negative attitudes toward scientists.

Introduction

1

There is growing awareness within the scientific community that researchers and their
institutions can and should make public engagement and communication more of a
priority [1–3]. But while scientists are answering calls to leverage new media tools [4], it
is important for them to consider that not all science communication efforts are created
equal. The impacts of these efforts depend on a variety of factors including real or
perceived characteristics of the message (content, tone, frame, etc.), the audience(s),
and the communicator(s) [5]. People tend to be cognitive misers in evaluating
information and forming attitudes [6]. They often use a communicator’s perceived
trustworthiness as a heuristic for how credible, personally relevant, reliable, pertinent,
and persuasive a message is [7, 8].
People are more likely to pay attention to and act upon “quality information
communicated by sources they see as trustworthy in terms of expertise, honesty, and
shared identity” [5, 9]. Trust, which involves mutual understanding between
communicator and audience, is vital for scientists speaking on issues of pressing public
concern such as public health or climate change [10, 11]. The audience member should
feel that scientists “get me”. Scientists and their institutions need to be sincerely
friendly, demonstrate a shared value system, and engage people’s emotions [12]. High

quality interactions with likeable scientists encourage positive beliefs about science and
scientists’ messages [3].
Unfortunately, scientists are generally perceived by Americans as highly competent
but only moderately warm; they “earn respect but not trust” [12]. Studies investigating
scientists’ prioritization of public communication objectives have also found very little
attention to this issue of warmth or focus on building trust [3, 13]. Scientists’ isolation
in “the ivory tower” [2, 14] and focus on defending science rather than building
relationships with the public [3], along with stereotype-reinforcing media portrayals,
have likely contributed to both ambivalent public perceptions and more negative
stereotypes of scientists.
Scientists’ use of direct-to-public communication tools such as social media [15] may
be spurring concern over their public image. However, social media could also be an
avenue for relationship building between scientists and citizens. These relationships
could help challenge stereotypes of scientists as being competent but socially inept and
eccentric [16], cold, and capable of immoral conduct [17]. To accomplish this, scientists
must use social media in ways that communicate their warmth and not just their
scientific competence.

Background and Literature Review

36

Social Cognition, Warmth and Competence

37

We use social cognition and the stereotype content model [18] as the framework to
understand how perceptions of scientist Instagrammers may impact trust in scientists.
Social cognition consists of the idea that “people everywhere differentiate each other by
liking (warmth, trustworthiness) and by respecting (competence, efficiency)” [19]. The
stereotype content model postulates that group stereotypes can be captured by the two
universal dimensions of social cognition: warmth and competence [18]. Warmth is based
on one’s perceptions of another individual’s or group’s intentions, while competence is
based on one’s confidence that the individual or group can act on their intentions.
Traits that add to perceived warmth include friendliness, tolerance, modesty, openness,
sociability, honesty, happiness, helpfulness, sincerity, and morality. Traits that add to
perceived competence include intelligence, skill, creativity, and persistence [19]. Both
competence and warmth are critical constructs of trust. However, perceived warmth
carries more weight in terms of people’s attitudes and behaviors toward an individual or
stereotyped group [19]. Morality or warmth judgments are primary - they are made
more quickly, they determine approach or avoidance behavior, and they carry more
weight in attitude formation than competence judgments do [19–21].
Outgroups (people unlike oneself) are often perceived as either competent but not
warm and associated with feelings of threat and envy, neither competent nor warm and
associated with feelings of contempt, or warm but not competent and thus pitied [19].
How one perceives outgroups can be predicted by the perceived status of the group and
competition with one’s in-group. High status and competitive outgroups such as
scientists are often perceived as competent but not very warm [12]. In-group individuals,
close allies, and other groups like nurses and teachers are admired and perceived as both
highly warm and competent [12]. Instead of threatening, they are “like you” in their
underlying interests and values [19, 22, 23]. They have high potential to be compelling
communicators. By sharing their values and humanizing themselves, we think scientists
can get there too.

Perceptions of Scientists

65

Longitudinal results from the General Social Survey (GSS) since the 1970s suggest
relatively stable and high levels of U.S. public confidence in scientists. Men, younger
individuals, and individuals with higher levels of education and income express the
highest levels of confidence in scientists. However, an increasing percentage of the U.S.
public also finds scientists to be “odd and peculiar” (52% strongly agreed or agreed, up
from 36% in 2012) [24]. This stereotype reflects longtime fiction media portrayals of
scientists as eccentric, strange and detached from everyday life [25, 26]. Based on this
and other stereotypes, scientists as a group don’t immediately inspire friendliness and
warmth, vital characteristics of trusted communicators.
We should note that media portrayals of scientists have improved in the last decade
toward characters that can generally be categorized as intelligent and “good” [27].
However, portrayals of scientists in both entertainment and news media still lack
diversity, particularly in terms of gender and race according to the recent “Portray Her”
report from The Lyda Hill Foundation and the Geena Davis’s Institute on Gender in
Media. Popular images of the scientist as an elderly, white-haired man and people’s
general unfamiliarity with real-life scientists and what they do tend to maintain
negative stereotypes or at least perceptions that scientists are among an elite outgroup
that doesn’t share the values, interests, and identity of most people.

Warmth and competence stereotypes of scientists are likely exacerbated by gender
stereotypes and gender science stereotypes that associate STEM with being male [28].
Women are generally perceived as more warm, likeable, and friendly, but slightly less
competent, than men [7, 18]. Positive perceptions of female scientists as not only
competent but also warm could be a positive force for scientist stereotypes, except that
gender science stereotypes limit opportunities for women to succeed, become leaders in
their fields, and positively influence the image of science. Pervasive stereotypes
associate science and scientific work with men more than women [29]. These stereotypes
both aggravate and are aggravated by gender gaps in retention, achievement, visibility,
and leadership in STEM [30–37]. The Catch-22 for scientists’ public image problem is
that women scientists who could improve perceptions of scientists’ relatability and
warmth are both underrepresented in prestigious scientific media outlets [38] and in
media that nonscientists consume [39]. They are also judged for taking on
stereotypically male roles and traits associated with scientific work [35, 40, 41]. The
clashing of gender roles in STEM is exemplified by the fact that female scientists are
often told that they “don’t look like scientists” [42]. Independent, self-confident,
competitive, senior women in male-dominated fields are harshly critiqued [43]. This
makes it difficult for women to achieve the equal representation in STEM and the media
attention that could help shift stereotypes of scientists and help young girls see
themselves in STEM. Scientists from other marginalized groups face similar challenges.
The scientist as we’ve known “him” from literature is a white male, a social outsider
who is unscrupulous or even dangerous in his pursuit of scientific discovery [44]. More
modern media portrayals of scientists also tend to be male. Female scientists are often
presented in media programs as more of an exception to the rule (a lonely heroine, an
unlikely clever beauty, a rare superstar) than as positive counter-stereotypes [45]. Media
portrayals of female scientists are likely to show them in supporting roles to male
scientists and to focus on their appearance, sexuality, and personal lives as opposed to
their work successes [46]. A fetishizing of the appearance of female scientists in the
media reinforces gender role beliefs and promotes the idea that women in STEM are eye

candy rather than experts. This was exemplified by the #distractinglysexy social media
campaign that became viral in 2015 [47]. Media misrepresentation undermines women
scientists’ ability to positively influence the stereotypical image of scientists as aloof,
nerdy, socially inept, and male.
Social media platforms may offer women and minority scientists an opportunity to
create their own narratives through self-images and new takes on what scientists look
like, what they do, what they care about, and how both warm and competent they are.
A diversity of real-life scientist faces in our media environments could help others begin
to individuate scientists, help break down stereotypes, and foster more inclusion in
STEM.

Using Visuals to Put a Friendly Face on Science and Change
Stereotypes
Visual social networking platforms cater to real-time self-disclosure, which is critical to
the relationship building that can promote trust between individuals and break down
group stereotypes [48, 49]. One way to operationalize how a scientist could visually
communicate their warmth is through today’s cultural artifact for online self-disclosure the “selfie”. Selfies close the distance between photographer and viewer - even
astronauts take selfies [50]. There is an emerging trend within the online STEM
community to use portraits to help change people’s perceptions of what a scientist looks
like and does on a daily basis. Hashtag movements such as
#ThisIsWhatAScientistLooksLike, #BlackandSTEM, #DistractinglySexy, and
#ScientistsWhoSelfie have attempted to combat stereotypes of STEM professionals
through visual imagery [51]. While these movements may promote feelings of
empowerment within the group seeking to change its public image, it is unknown
whether such movements can actually improve stereotyped perceptions of scientists.
The idea of using portraits to change perceptions has a basis in social cognition
research. Counterstereotypical exemplars have been shown to change perceptions of and
bias toward outgroups, as well as reduce or revise stereotypes [52]. Individuation
processes, in which viewers pay attention to a person’s individual attributes and see
that person as human with ideally shared beliefs and good intentions [53], can help
counter negative stereotypes about that person and their group. But individuating
takes effort [54]. People often don’t put this effort toward stereotyped outgroups or
groups they aren’t familiar with. However, individuation can take place when people are
asked or motivated to take notice of individual attributes or pay extra attention to
individual faces [53]. Individual processing of scientists’ faces, especially when they
display warmth attributes, might help challenge stereotypes.
Positive facial expressions [55], images of friendly faces [56], and images of attractive
faces [57] can influence social cognition. Smiling faces vs. neutral faces score higher on
attributes including friendliness [58], generosity, agreeableness, sincerity [59],
extroversion [55], and warmth [60]. Smiling can also combine with gender to influence
perceptions of warmth. In one study, female smiling faces were evaluated as warmer
than male smiling faces [56]. But while facial expressions can influence interpersonal
trait inferences, it is unclear whether they can, when displayed by members of
outgroups, move the needle on warmth stereotypes. There is evidence that positive
images of individuals can suppress automatic attitudes and stereotypes [61], that social
exposure to counterstereotypes (like women leaders) can reduce automatic gender
stereotyping [62], and that counterstereotypic mental imagery (e.g. imagining a strong
woman) can reduce implicit stereotypes [63].

Why Study Instagram as a Tool for Building Trust in Science
Instagram (IG), released in 2010, is a photo and video social media sharing platform
that encourages viewers to enter Instagrammers’ worlds and get to know them through
selfies and self-videos. Scientists, including several authors of this paper, are using IG to
open up their lab and fieldwork for broader audiences. An interconnected group of
thousands of scientists at various career stages use IG to share their lives and work as
scientists, for example via #weareSTEMsquad. A number of popular “Rotation
Curation” accounts feature different scientists through images and captions about their
work, career paths, hobbies, etc. Through the use of hashtags, users can identify and
follow trending topics. The more Instagrammers use a particular hashtag, the more
likely that hashtag will trend through the Instagram algorithmic “For You” section,
recommending the hashtag to similar users and users who follow similar topics. The For
You section provides an opportunity for general audiences to access a diverse collection
of science topics. The growth of a diverse, humanized scientific community on IG begs a
greater understanding of how viewers evaluate scientist Instagrammers and whether
connecting with scientists on IG fosters trust.

Our primary research question for this study was whether scientist selfies on IG posted
by scientist Instagrammers (IGers) change stereotypes of scientists’ warmth vs.
competence. We expected that individuating a multitude of scientists in selfies
displaying warmth traits (broad smiles, eye contact, friendly gestures) would help
change group warmth stereotypes for scientists in general. Based on our literature
review, we hypothesized the following:
H1. Scientist IGers who post selfies will be perceived as warmer than scientist IGers
who post science-only photos.
H2. Scientist selfies on IG will positively influence perceptions of scientists’ warmth
in general, as compared to science-only IG posts.
We also explored the impact of stimulus condition on competence, although we did
not expect scientists posting selfies to be perceived as more or less competent than
scientists posting science-only photos. We did not expect changes in perceived
competence for our IGers or scientists in general given the presence of prominent
scientific competence cues (lab coats, scientific equipment, etc.) and scientific captions
used consistently across stimulus groups.
We predicted that female scientists would be perceived as warmer than male
scientists. We also expected that a strong representation of women scientists in IG posts
would positively influence perceptions of gender science stereotypes as well as
perceptions of scientists’ warmth.
H3a. Female scientist IGers will be perceived as warmer than male scientist IGers.
H3b. Female scientist IG posts (especially selfies) will result in positive changes in
gender science stereotypes, as compared to male scientist IG posts, especially for selfies.
H3c. Female scientist IG posts (especially selfies) will result in more positive
perceptions of scientists’ warmth in general, as compared to male scientist IG posts.

or selfie posts of female scientists). These IG posts were originally tested within a lab
environment in a pilot study among 162 undergraduate students (see Supplemental
Information (SI) Appendix and Table S1 for methods and results). We found in our
pilot study that scientists in selfies were perceived as significantly warmer than
scientists posting science-only images.

A total of 891 respondents or 55% of the final sample identified as female, with a mean
age of 46 years (SD = 16.6, range = 85 years). Participants primarily self-identified as
White (77%), Black (9%), or Hispanic/Latino (6%). Roughly 30% of respondents had
attained at least a Bachelor’s (4 year) degree, with only 10% having a degree in a
STEM field. A majority of the respondents were social media users (87%, n = 1408)
and nearly half (46%, n = 747) indicated having an IG account. See other demographic
information in SI Appendix, Table S2.

Respondents generally indicated having similar levels of interest in information about
science (M = 3.1, SD = 1.2) as in politics (M = 3.2, SD = 1.3), sports (M = 3.0, SD =
1.4), and business (M = 3.0, SD = 1.2), with the highest interest in health and medicine
(M = 3.5, SD = 1.1). Surprisingly, 32% (n = 433) of social media users indicated
following at least one scientist. However, only 18% of all respondents (n = 284)
indicated knowing a scientist personally. Overall, respondents perceived scientists in
accordance with cultural stereotypes. Based on our control group (n = 339), scientists
are seen as highly competent (M = 4.00, SD = .68), but only moderately warm (M =
3.29, SD = .61). Respondents in the control group also tended to relate science more
with being male than with being female (M = 2.45 on a 5-point scale from strongly male
to strongly female, SD = .87), but liberal arts (M = 3.34, SD = .79) and social media
use (M = 3.43, SD = .86) more with being female. When asked about the IG content
they had seen during stimulus exposure, respondents generally indicated having enjoyed
it (M = 3.56 on a 5-point scale, SD = .82). Respondents generally perceived the IGers
they had encountered to be trustworthy (M = 5.35 on a 7-point scale, SD = 1.21).

We investigated overall impacts of stimulus exposure on enjoyment; perceived
trustworthiness, warmth, and competence of the encountered IGers; warmth and
competence stereotypes of scientists; perceived symbolic threat of scientists; and gender
science stereotypes. We did so in a series of ANCOVA analyses controlling for
participant gender, age, education, interest in science, IG use, importance of religion,
and knowing a scientist personally. We used Bonferonni-adjusted post hoc comparisons
to investigate differences on key outcome variables between each of the stimulus
conditions. See results in Table 1 and Figure 1.
Perceptions of Instagrammers. There was a significant main effect for stimulus
on enjoyment (across all conditions: Stimulus F (4, 1569) = 6.82, p < .001; Model F (11,
1569) = 23.10, p < .001). Participants who had browsed any experimental science IG
posts enjoyed the content significantly more than did participants who had viewed
control IG posts (p < .01). There was also a main effect of stimulus on the perceived
trustworthiness of the IGers (Stimulus F (4, 1569) = 9.60, p < .001; Model F (11, 1569)
= 13.58, p < .001)). Participants who had browsed selfies, especially those containing a
female scientist’s face, perceived the IGers they had encountered to be significantly

more trustworthy than did participants who had browsed control or science-only posts
(p < .001).
There was also a main effect of stimulus on the perceived warmth (Stimulus F (3,
1237) = 76.67, p < .001, Model F (10, 1237) = 29.67, p < .001) and competence
(Stimulus F (3, 1237) = 2.82, p < .05, Model F (10, 1237) = 9.15, p < .001) of the IGers.
When asked to evaluate the warmth (single item) of select scientists from our IG posts,
participants viewing selfies evaluated the IGers, on average, as significantly warmer
than did participants viewing science-only photos (p < .001). Participants viewing
female selfies evaluated the IGers as significantly warmer than participants viewing
male selfies (p < .001). For competence (single item), few significant differences were
observed between stimulus conditions apart from female IGers in selfies receiving higher
competence evaluations than male IGers in selfies (p < .05).
Science Stereotypes. We found a significant impact of stimulus on warmth of
scientists (across all conditions: F (4, 1569) = 6.62, p < .001; Model F (11, 1569) =
11.18, p < .001). Participants who had browsed selfies of either gender, but particularly
female selfies, evaluated scientists as warmer than did participants who had browsed
control (p < .001) or science-only IG posts (p < .01). These results are based on an
ANCOVA analysis with a collapsed stimulus variable (control vs science-only vs selfies,
F (2, 1571) = 10.46, p < .001). Participants who had viewed selfies also evaluated
scientists as more competent overall (across all conditions: F (4, 1569) = 2.48, p < .01;
Model F (11, 1569) = 8.07, p < .001) and perceived less threat from scientists (F (4,
1568) = 3.22, p < .05; Model F (11, 1568) = 14.35, p < .001). Perceived threat was
lowest when participants had browsed selfies from scientists of the opposite sex. The
estimated marginal means and standard errors (M (SE )) for threat are: 2.83(.09) for

significant means comparisons); 2.75(.08) for control, 2.42(.09) for male selfies and
2.60(.08) for female selfies viewed by women (only significant mean comparison is
between male selfies and control, p < .05).

We hypothesized that scientist IGers in selfies would be perceived as warmer than
scientist IGers posting science-only photos (H1). We ran linear regression models to
identify predictors of individual IGers’ average perceived warmth (single item; F (12,
1235) = 48.64, p < .001; R2 = .32) as well as competence (single item; F (12, 1235) =
29.58, p < .001; R2 = .22). We found stimulus (science-only versus selfie) to be a
significant predictor of scientist IGer warmth (β = .35, p < .001) but not competence
(β = -.01, p = .88). We accounted for scientist gender, enjoyment, participant age,
education, interest in science, importance of religion, IG use, political affiliation, and
knowing a scientist personally. IGers in selfies were evaluated as significantly warmer
than IGers posting science-only photos. There were no significant differences in
perceived competence. Scientist gender was a significant predictor of warmth (β = .09,
p < .001) but not competence. Female scientists received the highest warmth
evaluations. These results support H1, that scientists in selfies are perceived as warmer
than scientists posting science-only photos on IG, and H3a. Other predictors of scientist
IGer warmth and competence evaluations are enjoyment and participant IG use. For
perceived competence of the scientist IGers, participant education level was a significant
predictor. See regression model results in Table 2.
When we added perceived attractiveness (an average of attractiveness evaluations) of
the IGers to our linear regression models, we found that attractiveness strongly
predicted both perceived competence and warmth. Using Andrew Hayes’ PROCESS
version 3.1 (Model 4) in SPSS [64], we found that attractiveness mediates effects of
scientist gender on warmth evaluations (Total effect = .16, t(1235) = 3.95, p < .001;

We also ran a linear regression model predicting perceived trustworthiness of the
encountered IGers (F (11, 1569) = 15.26, p < .001; R2 = .10). See SI, Table S4. We
measured perceived trustworthiness after stimulus exposure and before participants
evaluated the warmth and competence of select individual IGers. We found that
participants who had browsed selfies evaluated the IGers they had encountered as
significantly more trustworthy than participants who had browsed science-only (β = .12,
p < .001) or control IG posts (β = .13, p < .001). Other significant predictors included
age, IG use, and political affiliation. Participants who were younger (β = .05, p < .05),
more interested in science (β = .22, p < .001), more frequent IG users (β = .09, p <
.01), and Democrats (versus Republicans; β = .12, p < .001) evaluated the scientist
IGers as more trustworthy. When we added scientist gender into the model (control
group excluded), we found that participants who had browsed female scientist IG posts
evaluated the IGers as significantly more trustworthy than did participants who had

browsed male scientist IG posts (β = .06, p < .05; F (11, 1236) = 12.81, p < .001; R2 =
.10). Results for the other predictors remained consistent.

Predicting Science Stereotypes

326

327

We hypothesized that seeing selfies of scientists, via processes of individuating scientists
and evaluating their smiling faces, would positively influence stereotypes of scientists’
warmth (H2). We ran linear regression models predicting perceptions of scientists’
warmth (F (11, 1569) = 13.01, p < .001; R2 = .08) as well as competence (F (11, 1569)
= 8.71, p < .001; R2 = .06). See results in Table 3, Model 1. We accounted for factors
that could impact stereotypes including participant age, gender, education, interest in
science, importance of religion, IG use, political affiliation, and knowing a scientist
personally. Two dummy coded stimulus variables, 1) control versus other and 2)
science-only versus other (reference group was selfies, male and female), were significant
predictors of both warmth and competence. Participants who had browsed selfies
perceived scientists in general to be both warmer and more competent than participants
who had browsed control or science-only IG posts. We thus found support for H2;
scientist selfies positively influenced perceptions of scientists’ warmth over science-only
IG posts by scientists. We did not expect the increase in perceived competence that
scientists received from participants who had browsed selfies, although additional
competence cues (e.g. scientists working in the lab) and attractiveness of selfies could
have played a role.
Individual Scientist Evaluations as Mediators of Stereotypes. We explored
whether attractiveness and warmth evaluations of individual IGers were mediators of
stimulus effects on stereotypes. Using Andrew Hayes’ PROCESS version 3.1 (Model 6)
in SPSS [64], we found that perceived attractiveness and warmth of individual IGers
fully mediate the impact of stimulus (science-only vs. selfies) on warmth stereotypes of
scientists. See Figure 2. We added the following as covariates: participant gender, age,
education, interest in science, knowing a scientist personally, political affiliation, IG use,
and enjoyment. Scientists in selfies were evaluated as more attractive (β = .24, t(1236)
= 6.93, p < .001; Model R2 = .16, p < .001) and warmer (β = .49, t(1235) = 12.84, p
< .001; Model R2 = .40, p < .001) than scientists posting science-only photos. Warmth
stereotypes of scientists in general were also predicted by both perceived attractiveness
(β = .11, t(1234) = 4.00, p < .001; Model R2 = .40, p < .001) and perceived warmth of
individual IGers (β = .38, t(1234) = 16.70, p < .001). Perceived attractiveness was a
significant predictor of warmth in evaluations of individual IGers (β = .41, t(1235) =
12.83, p < .001). Thus there were the following significant indirect effects: Stimulus >
attractiveness > stereotypes (Effect = .03, 95% CI [.01, .04]); stimulus > warmth of
IGers > stereotypes (Effect = .18, 95%CI [.14, .23]); stimulus > attractiveness >
warmth of IGers > stereotypes (Effect = .04, 95% CI[.02, .05]). The total indirect effect
of stimulus on warmth stereotypes (Effect = .25, 95%CI [.20, .29]) is greater than the
total effect (β = .13, t(1236) = 3.81, p < .001). The stimulus condition combines selfies
of both genders. However, female scientists in selfies are evaluated as significantly more
attractive than male scientists (p < .001), and male scientists in selfies are not
evaluated as any more attractive than the scientists who take science-only photos are
guessed to be (see SI).
We also found that attractiveness of IGers is a mediator of stimulus effect on
competence stereotypes in a similar PROCESS (Model 4) analysis with covariates as
described above. Without attractiveness, stimulus had a significant and positive total
effect on competence stereotypes (β = .10, t(1236) = 2.69, p < .01; Model R2 = .17, p
< .001). However, attractiveness was also a significant predictor of competence
stereotypes (β = .14, t(1235) = 4.54, p < .001; Model R2 = .19, p < .001) and
suppressed the direct impact of stimulus on competence when included in the regression

Gender Science Stereotypes and Female Scientists’ Warmth and
Competence
We hypothesized that seeing female scientists in IG posts would counteract gender
science stereotypes and promote warmth (H3b and H3c). We ran ANCOVA analyses
and linear regression models using dichotomous factors for stimulus condition
(science-only vs. selfies) and scientist gender (male vs. female). We also accounted for
participant age, gender, education, interest in science, importance of religion, IG use,
political affiliation, and knowing a scientist personally.
We found that only female scientist selfies resulted in a significant shift in stereotypes
that associate STEM fields with being male (see Table 2). In a linear regression model
(F (11, 1236) = 5.36, p < .001; R2 = .04), the presence of female scientists in IG posts
was a significant predictor (β = .08, p < .01) of female-shifted science stereotypes, while
overall stimulus condition (science-only vs. selfies) was not a significant predictor (β =
.04, p = .21). Other significant predictors of female-shifted stereotypes were younger
age (β = -.08, p < .05), lower education level (β = -.15, p < .001), and less IG use (β =
-.07, p < .05) among participants. Thus, we find support for H3b.
To investigate warmth stereotypes by scientist gender, we ran a linear regression
model (F (11, 1236) = 10.23, p < .001; R2 = .08) predicting warmth using two variables:
a collapsed stimulus variable (science-only vs. selfies) and a scientist gender variable
(male vs. female) (see Table 3, Model 2). All other predictors included in the model
were the same as those used to investigate warmth in the Predicting Science Stereotypes
section above. We found that across all stimulus conditions, scientist gender was not a
significant predictor of warmth. However, when we used dummy coded variables for all
stimulus conditions with the control group as the reference (F (13, 1567) = 11.38, p <
.001; R2 = .09), we found that only female scientist selfies resulted in significantly
greater perceptions of scientists’ warmth (β = .12, p < .001). Male scientist selfies
resulted in marginally greater perceptions of scientists’ warmth compared to control
images (β = .06, p < .06). Female scientist selfies resulted in significantly greater
perceptions of scientists’ warmth compared to every other stimulus condition
individually (vs. sci male, β = .12, p < .001; vs. sci female, β = .11, p < .001; vs. selfie
male, β = .06, p < .04). This increase in perceived warmth was accompanied by an
increase in perceived competence. Only female scientist selfies resulted in significantly
greater perceptions of scientists’ competence in general (F (13, 1567) = 7.37, p < .001;
R2 = .06; β = .06, p < .05), with the control group as reference.

Scientists’ less-than-warm public image is problematic because warmth is a key
component of trust [19]. To build trust, scientists might consider humanizing science
through friendly self-portraiture in scientific settings. Scientists are generally perceived
as competent but often stereotyped as nerdy and socially inept, or more generally not
warm. We found that individuating and humanizing scientists in Instagram selfies can
counter these stereotypes. Viewers of scientist selfies perceived both scientist
Instagrammers and scientists in general to be warmer and at least as competent or more
competent than viewers of science-only or control Instagram posts did. Through a
process of individuating a series of smiling faces, seeing scientist selfies as opposed to
images of scientific objects posted by scientists online can reduce negative stereotypes.
In terms of preserving perceived competence, competence cues (e.g. a scientific setting,

scientific equipment, recounting of scientific work being conducted visually and through
photo captions), may be an important feature of scientist selfies.
We found gender to be a major driver of changes in stereotypes of scientists’ warmth
and gender science stereotypes. We found that seeing a series of female scientist selfies
on Instagram can shift stereotypes that associate STEM fields with being male, as well
as positively shift stereotypes about scientists’ warmth. Seeing individual
smiling/friendly faces contributed to this warmth shift. Although previous research has
shown that female smiling faces may influence men’s social judgments to a larger extent
than women’s social judgments [55], we found that our female scientist selfies had a
similar effect for both male and female viewers. Science-only photos posted by female
scientists did not significantly shift gender science stereotypes. This could be because
the female names in the captions were not attention-grabbing and/or memorable, or
because participants did not read the captions. We did not evaluate whether
participants properly attributed our science-only posts to scientists of the intended
gender. However, it is likely that female scientist selfies were most successful in moving
gender science stereotypes due to the greater accessibility of gender in these posts.
Our findings suggest that people viewing scientists’ Instagram posts begin to
individuate scientists as opposed to categorizing them into an outgroup that is
competent but cold. This individuating process could also help explain why female
scientist IGers posting selfies were not evaluated as stereotypically less competent than
male scientist IGers, even if their gender elicited greater perceived warmth. Their
identity as competent scientists may also have held a prominent sway over these
evaluations. We suggest that humanizing, visual science communication may be one way
for broader audiences to “get to know” scientists. However, we believe that scientists
should be genuine and transparent in humanizing themselves. By sharing selfies and
stories from their daily lives in the lab/field, talking about their motivations and
struggles, inviting viewer participation, and opening up the scientific process, scientists
could foster trust by individually and collectively embodying warmth as well as
competence.
Social media platforms like Instagram are unique in the opportunities they offer
researchers to reach public audiences. Social media platforms give diverse researchers a
platform to express themselves freely - an opportunity traditional media outlets
historically have not given women and minorities [65]. Social media platforms could
represent a turning of the tide for perceptions of scientists if leveraged by diverse
individuals to interact with broad audiences in ways that communicate warmth and
build mutual trust. We acknowledge that reaching truly broad audiences can be a
challenge for the scientist communicator. Training and planning can help. For example,
the Instagram algorithm relies on engagement to evaluate which posts users see in their
feed. The strategic use of relevant hashtags and interactive options (e.g. quizzes and fill
in the blank prompts unique to the Instagram Story) are likely to increase overall
engagement rates and thus increase scientists’ exposure to non-scientist audiences.

We cannot pinpoint the exact mechanism by which selfies increased participants’
perceived warmth of scientist Instagrammers and changed their stereotypes of scientists.
We prioritized externally valid stimulus content (created for us by scientists in the IG
community) and guided participants to browse a series of Instagram posts that
combined multiple warmth-related characteristics. For example, selfie conditions
consisted of seven smiling scientist faces of different ethnicities and styles, together with
captions written from the perspective of each featured scientist. The presence of smiling
expressions, the diversity in scientist appearance (including ethnicity), and the
combination of selfies with captions describing scientists’ motivations to do their work -

“I have been developing new and exciting technologies using genetic engineering to make
our immune system better at fighting cancer” - might all have contributed to changes in
stereotypes. The effects of these stimulus elements should be teased apart in future
work.
The physical attractiveness of our scientist Instagrammers also played a role in their
perceived warmth and competence. We observed that attractiveness is a mediator of
individual competence and warmth evaluations. Our female scientist Instagrammers
were consistently evaluated as more attractive than male scientist Instagrammers,
although this could be due to stereotypes that focus on women’s physical appearance
and lead to female smiling faces being more positively evaluated than male smiling faces.
We did not manipulate but rather measured attractiveness in our experiments. That
said, we note that we tried to match the physical appearance of male and female
scientists in selfies (similar clothing, only light makeup, etc.).
Perceived attractiveness has been associated with assessments of moral goodness,
aka the “Beauty-Is-Good” stereotype [66], trustworthiness [67], and intelligence [68].
This may help explain the boosts in competence and warmth that our female scientist
Instagrammers in selfies received. The Beauty-Is-Good stereotype particularly
influences judgments of social competence and interpersonal ease [69]. We note that all
of the faces we used in our experiment displayed broad smiles and friendly expressions,
which likely contributed not only to their perceived warmth but also their physical
attractiveness [70]. We suggest that future studies investigate the effects of smiling vs.
neutral scientist faces on perceptions of scientists’ warmth and competence, and the
extent to which gender stereotypes might interact with those effects.
Finally, The positive effect of selfies on warmth stereotypes of scientists may be
dependent on viewers being motivated to individuate the scientists in these images and
see them as human. We prompted such motivations by asking participants to evaluate
individual scientist Instagrammers - their warmth, competence and attractiveness, how
likely viewers would be to follow them in real life on Instagram, etc. - before asking
participants to reflect on perceptions of scientists in general. When participants were
asked questions about scientist stereotypes before evaluating individual Instagrammers,
our stimulus had a much weaker effect on warmth stereotypes (see SI and Table S3).
This is a limitation that should be investigated in future studies.
In summary, we believe that the power of selfies lies in humanizing and individuating
scientists of all appearances who display warmth traits (smiling, eye contact,
self-disclosure, sincerity, etc.). Any real-life scientist’s smiling face is likely to be
perceived as warmer than common perceptions of scientists as peculiar, unfamiliar, and
unfriendly. When it comes to smiling, however, we acknowledge gender bias that leads
to women being asked to “smile” for the benefit of others, a request not often made of
men. We do not endorse any use of our findings to bolster such bias. Finally, there are
many ways for scientist communicators to display warmth, honesty, and shared values
with audiences. The more diverse the approaches, the greater the potential reach. To
connect on a human level through a smiling “selfie” is just one promising approach
among many.

By humanizing themselves on social media, scientists may be able to increase trust,
public support, and interest in science. Scientists might help viewers individuate them
by creating personally curated content with detailed captions, regularly engaging with
audiences (asking questions, etc.), and sharing content that highlights “real life” as
much as the scientific process. Selfies on Instagram posted by scientists from
underrepresented groups may help others better “see” themselves in science and thereby
help increase diversity and inclusion in STEM. Schinskie and colleagues [71] found that

college students’ stereotypes of scientists are informed by their exposure to minority
scientists in real life. During the course of this study, we heard from several educators
who were using public #ScientistsWhoSelfie posts in their classrooms. For example, 8th
graders at Woodstock Union Middle School in Woodstock, Vermont were challenged to
reflect on their existing perceptions of scientists, through a Draw-A-Scientist test, and
then explore photos of real scientists posted with the #ScientistsWhoSelfie hashtag on
Instagram (R. Becker, personal communication). The students reflected on how their
original drawings compared to the #ScientistsWhoSelfie photos. Many observed that
scientists they saw in the photos, versus the ones they had drawn, did not fit a particular
mold (e.g. white lab coats) but rather looked and dressed like “normal people” [72].
These anecdotal observations correspond with our own findings that selfies in scientific
settings can help shape more positive perceptions of scientists. Yhis is perhaps partly a
result of exposure to a diverse set of faces that don’t fit traditional stereotypes.
This study is among the first to realistically address the usefulness of selfies for
science communication. Previous research has explored various obstacles and training
needs associated with scientists’ use of social media [73]. We suggest that scientists’ use
of Instagram and selfies can positively impact how they are perceived. Our results add
to a growing body of evidence that scientists can benefit from using social media.
Scientists’ online presence can increase the visibility of their research [74], promote
collaboration opportunities, improve research efficiency, enhance professional
networking, and, in light of our findings, help promote public trust. STEM communities
on social media might be able to meaningfully change science stereotypes by taking
control of online representations of scientists, humanizing them and bolstering their
online visibility. Institutional support for such efforts will be key to making what is
good for public perceptions of scientists be good for scientists, too. This is especially
true for women and minorities in STEM, who are often subjected to harsh online
criticism and yet are pushed into public engagement responsibilities, without any formal
reward or recognition. Where public engagement is forced, unwelcome or unrewarded,
scientists may also have little motivation to communicate with warmth.

Online Survey Experiment

555

This study was approved by the [redacted] Institutional Review Board: IRB# E10449,
Expiration 4/12/2020. Survey respondents were recruited and screened through a paid
Qualtrics Panel to meet U.S. representative quotas on gender, education and age (see
SI). We worked with Qualtrics to eliminate and replace 200 “trash” or unintelligible
survey responses based on an open-ended stimulus recall question. Respondents viewed
IG content embedded in a private Squarespace website designed to look like an
aggregation site for posts from a “Scientists of Instagram” Rocur IG account (see
www.scientistsofig.com). Participants were instructed to return to our survey to
complete the study after browsing the content to answer questions about the IGers they
encountered.
Data Processing. A total of 1,620 survey responses were recorded and included in
our final analyses. These included complete and partial but substantially complete
responses. We removed responses where the stimulus materials had been viewed for less
than 15 seconds. Where we detected that respondents had entered “5” or “1” across the
board on warmth/competence scales, regardless of survey item direction, we removed
these responses. Following this removal, no extreme outliers for warmth/competence
were detected in SPSS (interquartile range test outlier test). Our final analyses were
based on 339 respondents viewing control IG posts, 319 respondents viewing

Experimental Design and Stimulus Content

576

All research participants were randomly assigned to one of five different experimental
conditions, in all of which they saw a series of Instagram posts (photographs and
captions): (1) a control IG account of male and female “Humans of Southeastern”
(@humansofselu, lab experiment) or “Humans of Broadway” (@humansofbroadway,
online survey experiment); (2) a “Scientists of IG” account depicting seven photos of
scientific objects / equipment in lab or field settings, posted by seven different male
scientists as identified by name in the caption (Sam, Liam, Deboki, Martin, Kyle, Luis,
Ian); (3) same as (2) but posted by seven different female scientists (Samantha, Laura,
Deboki, Martha, Kylla, Luisa, Imogene); (4) a “Scientists of IG” account depicting seven
photos of the same scientific objects / equipment but with a male scientist’s smiling face
present; (5) same as (4) but with all female faces. We refer to these stimulus conditions
throughout this manuscript as: (1) control; (2) science-only male; (3) science-only
female; (4) male selfies; (5) female selfies. Selfies were recreations of science-only photos
(same objects/equipment and same overall scene) but containing a scientist’s smiling
face. For example, one science-only photo depicted a colorful bioreactor set up on a lab
bench, while the selfie equivalent depicted the bioreactor from the same angle but with
a male/female scientist in the shot pointing to the equipment and smiling at the camera.
See SI Appendix for a detailed description of stimulus content.
Following stimulus exposure, participants were asked questions about their
enjoyment of the content and their impressions of the IGers they had encountered.
They were then asked 1) to evaluate the warmth and competence of individual IGers as
represented by select sample of visual-only screenshots from the stimulus they had just
browsed (embedded in an online questionnaire), and 2) to answer questions about their
perceptions of scientists in general. We randomized the order of these question sections
(IGer evaluations and scientist stereotypes) for our online survey experiment.

See SI Appendix for all survey question wording and more information on scale items.
Enjoyment. We asked respondents to rate their enjoyment of the stimulus content in
a series of questions about how interesting, visually appealing, credible, useful, and
educational the IG posts were. These questions were combined into a 9-item enjoyment
scale (Cronbach’s alpha = .93, M = 3.57, SD = .82).
Perceptions of Scientist IGers. We measured how trustworthy respondents perceived
the IGers portrayed in stimulus content to be on 7-point Likert scale. For the selfie
conditions we also measured the extent to which respondents thought the IGers looked
like scientists (5-point Likert-type scale). We measured the extent to which respondents
saw themselves as similar or dissimilar to the IGers in terms of values, goals, opinions,
thoughts, and beliefs (7-point bipolar scales based on opposite word pairs). These
questions were combined into a 5-item value similarity scale (Cronbach’s alpha = .89, M
= 4.17, SD = 1.36).
Warmth and Competence of Scientist IGers. We used a selection of four photos from
our experimental IG posts to ask respondents to evaluate the warmth, competence, and
physical attractiveness of individual scientist IGers. Based on photos without captions,
respondents were asked how warm/competent/attractive the person who took each
photo (science-only posts) or the person in each photo (selfie posts) was, on a 5-point
scale from not at all to extremely.

Warmth and Competence Stereotypes of Scientists. We used a question derived from
Fiske’s work on stereotypes of scientists [12] to measure the warmth and competence
stereotypes. We told survey respondents that we were interested in learning how
different groups of people are viewed by society, and asked them to indicate on scale
from 1 (not at all) to 5 (extremely) how well a range of different words represent traits
of scientists, in general (Generally speaking, scientists are. . . ). Respondents rated 20
different words for how well they represent traits of scientists. Included were words
representing warmth (Cronbach’s alpha = .90, M = 3.37, SD = .65; 9 items: sincere,
honest, warm, helpful, sociable, ethical, likeable, friendly, trustworthy) and competence
(Cronbach’s alpha = .78, M = 4.01, SD = .71; 3 items: competent, confident,
intelligent).
Explicit Gender Science Stereotypes. We asked respondents how much they
associated different activities, including science, liberal arts, and social media use, with
being male or female, on a 5-point Likert-type scale from Strongly Male to Strongly
Female.
Media Habits and Science Interest. We measured respondents’ frequency of seeking
out science information online, frequency of social media and IG use. We asked
respondents to rate their interest in information about a range of topics including:
science, politics, sports, business and finance, and health and medicine. We asked
respondents whether they knew a scientist personally and to name one or more.
Demographics. We asked survey respondents to self-report sex, age, ethnicity, level
of education, degree field (if at least a 2-year degree), number of science classes taken in
college, political affiliation, and importance of religion in their lives.

Fig 1. Bar graphs (boxes “f”: through “l”) represent impacts of IG stimulus viewing
on enjoyment (box i), perceived trustworthiness of the IGers (box j), perceived symbolic
threat from scientists (box k), warmth and competence evaluations of individual
scientist IGers (top of boxes f and g), perceived warmth and competence of scientists
(bottom of boxes f and g), and gender science stereotypes (box k). For bar graph values
and standard errors, see Table 1. Asterisks (*) denote significant differences between
means (per box) connected by dotted lines. Select comparisons are represented visually
for emphasis; for an exhaustive list, see Table 1. Figure created by Jen Burgess, Isoline
