Abstract
Much work of studying opening conversations has been conducted on landline telephone calls;
whereas, mobile phone conversations have received less attention by researchers despite of the
dominance of using mobile phone in our social life. Informed by conversation analysis (CA)
approach, this study aims to identify the opening sequences and ritual expressions of informal
mobile phone conversations among Saudi friends and relatives. Another goal is that to identify
whether the opening sequences of mobile phone are similar or different from the landline
telephone. The study will answer the following questions: what are the opening sequences and
ritual expressions of mobile phone? And what are the similarities and differences between mobile
phone and landline telephone in terms of the opening sequences. Thirty audio-recorded and
transcribed mobile phone conversations served as the data source for this study. Data were
analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively by using the CA approach. Findings showed that the
majority of opening sequences of mobile phone calls were reduced to three sequences: summons
answer, greeting exchanges, and how-are-you exchanges due the impact of caller ID. In addition,
the sequence of identification/recognition can be found when the caller does not know the callee
or the number is silent. Therefore, mobile phone and landline telephone have similarities and
differences in the opening sequences in general. However, the differences observed can be a reason
of the cultural practices for language use more than the effect of medium used in communication
such as landline telephone and mobile phone in Saudi Arabic. Finally, more data are needed to
investigate gender differences.

Introduction
This study examines opening sequences and ritual expressions of informal mobile phone
conversations to identify the sequences and their ritual expressions used in these turns between
Saudis. Another goal is to identify whether the opening sequences of mobile phone calls are similar
or different from landline opening sequences. Mobile phone (i.e. cell phone) had been used only
by businesspeople at the beginning of this technology; however, it has become dominant in our
social life and used by adults and even children at the present (Hutchby & Barnett, 2005). It has
been argued that, in the previous technological innovations, new technologies such as internet,
broadcasting, and landline telephone change social life in terms of creating new forms of social
interaction and social practice by producing new structures of conversations that need to be
investigated based on empirical studies on naturally occurring data, rather than abstract concepts
or assumptions (Hutchby, 2001; Hutchby & Barnett, 2005). Much work of opening conversations
has been conducted on landline telephone conversations that began with Sacks’ lectures on
conversations on telephone calls made to an emergency psychiatric hospital and Schegloff (1968,
1972, 1979, 1986, 2002) on various topics on opening conversations on telephone such as
sequences, identification and recognition, and routine. Schegloff (1968, 1979, 1986) identifies the
four canonical sequences in opening American telephone calls; a summons answer sequence,
identifications/recognition, greetings, and exchange of how-are-you based on northern American
data (i.e. Anglo-Americans). However, Schegloff (2002) acknowledges that he had no opportunity
to examine data on the use of any devices (e.g. cell phones, mobile phones, and car phones), and
did not study telephone as an object of inquiry. He is wondering the sequences of caller ID which
is pervasive and one of the characteristics in mobile phones and mentioning that “we have no
studies that I am aware of that tell us what the consequences of caller ID have been for the actual
conduct talk on the telephone, and their openings in particular” (Schegloff, 2002, p. 293). Also,
Schegloff (2002) adds that, in his words, “caller ID could change the asymmetries of information
noted about past telephone interaction by making it possible for the recipient to know something
before lifting the receiver” (p. 293).
Mobile phone has some features that distinguish it from landline telephone, or at least at the
period of Schegloff’s studies on telephone such as caller ID, mobility, creating a particular ring
for specific persons, and blocking callers (Schegloff, 2002; Weilenmann, 2003; Hutchby &
Barnett, 2005; Arminen & Leinonen, 2006). The caller ID and mobility are more pervasive in
mobile phone than landline telephones. Caller ID function may affect the sequence of
identification/recognition due to identifying the name of caller before answering the phone
(Schegloff, 2002). Thus, the ordered sequences of opening conversations may change. Another
difference is that the mobile phone is more personal; whereas, landline is usually shared by family
members or colleagues in work offices (Arminen, 2005).
Hutchby and Barnett (2005) investigate the sequential organization of mobile phone
conversations on British data and find out that the sequences of opening in mobile phone talk are
similar to landline phone talk. This study raises a hot debate between Hutchby (2005) and Arminen
(2005) about Hutchby and Barnett’s results and their claims for the similarities between mobile
phone and landline telephone. As a result, Arminen and Leinonen (2006) conduct a study on
opening practices in Finnish mobile call openings. They notice that the opening sequences of
mobile phone differ from landline telephone opening. This dispute of whether the mobile phone is

similar or different from landline telephone and the dearth of studies on this topic require more
investigation based on conducting empirical studies that is one of the goals for this study besides
identifying the ritual expressions of these sequences.
Therefore, this current study attempts to examine and identify the sequences and ritual
expressions of opening in mobile phone calls between Saudis to understand the linguistic behavior
in mobile phone calls in particular and in Arabic in general. Another goal is to identify whether
the opening sequences of mobile phone are similar to or different from opening in landline
telephone talk.
Literature review
This part encompasses three parts of previous research related to the current topic. The first part
will display the results of earlier studies on opening landline telephone conversations and
demonstrate the issues of claiming universal structures and across cultural differences to
understand the structure or sequences of opening in depth. The second part will review the earlier
studies on mobile phone calls. The final part will display the earlier studies on greetings in Arabic
because of having the ritual expressions of opening conversations that are mainly related to one of
the goals in this study, but the medium is different. The studies of Arabic greetings have been on
face to face communication while the current study is on mobile phone communication.
Opening Telephone Conversations
Analyzing telephone conversations, as mentioned earlier, began with Sacks’ (1992) lectures on
conversations on telephone calls made to an emergency psychiatric hospital and Schegloff (1967,
1968, 1979, 1986). Schegloff (1968, 1979, 1986) identifies the four canonical sequences in the
opening of North American telephone conversations based on analyzing 500 telephone
conversations: (1) a summons/answer sequence (the telephone rings and the first response is
uttered by the answerer), (2) an identification/recognition sequence (each party identifying self
and displaying recognition of the other), (3) a greeting sequence (an exchange of greeting tokens),
and (4) a how-are-you sequence (a pair of pairs in which each participant poses an initial inquiry).
These opening sequences are the majority of sequences in the American data. Also, he indicates
that Americans prefer identification by other recognition, rather than by explicit self-identification.
When Schegloff identified the canonical opening of telephone, he did not claim the universalness
structure for his model that was misunderstood by many researchers working on across cultural
studies such as Godard (1977) and Sifianou (1989). They argue that the structure of telephone
openings differ across language communities. In contrast, Hopper and Doany (1989) and Hopper,
Doany, Johnson, and Drummond (1991) claim universal structures for Schegloff’s model.
From that brief history about Schegloff’s canonical model of opening and the claims of others
towards universal structures and the cross cultural differences, many languages have been studied
by researchers to contribute to the topic. Some studies of opening telephone calls are comparative
such as French and American English (Godard, 1977), British English and Greek (Sifianou, 1989),
English, French, and Arabic (Hopper & Doany, 1989), Japanese and Korean (Park, 2002),
Australian and German (Grieve & Seebus, 2008). The other studies, which are not comparative,
are Arabic (Schmidt, 1975; Saadah, 2009), Spanish (Hopper et al., 1991; Coronel-Molina, 1998),
Dutch (Houtkoop-Steenstra, 1991; Houtkoop-Steenstra, 2003), Swedish (Lindstro¨m, 1994),

Chinese (Hopper & Chen, 1996; Sun, 2004), Persian (Taleghani-Nikazm, 2002), and Greek
(Sifianou, 2002).
Godard (1977) claims considerable variation between cultures and compared between French
and American English. She concludes that there is a difference between these two languages which
is that French caller checks the number first and must name himself/herself because it is considered
impolite in the French culture. An American caller, in contrast, does not check for the number but
questions the answerer’s identity for checking. Thereafter, she reports the steps in opening
telephone conversations in French: check number, name oneself at the first opportunity, and excuse
oneself (optional in case of intimacy). However, these steps are generalized reconstructions, and
Godard did not provide any examples of these sequences. Rather, she relies on her experience and
intuition as a member of French culture. Hopper and Doany’s (1989) findings differ from Godard’s
descriptions in some details about French.
Hopper and Doany (1989) argue for the universal structure of canonical opening telephone
conversations and examine this aspect in three languages: English, French, and Arabic (i.e.
Lebanese Arabic). These languages show similarity in opening sequences. They point out that the
word allo in French and Arabic (a linguistic borrowing term in Lebanon), like hello in English, are
used frequently as a first response to summons. Also, it is discovered that it is used by Iranians
(Taleghani-Nikazm, 2002) and sometimes by Dutch (Houtkoop-Steenstra, 1991). Allo is not used
in face to face communication neither in French nor in Arabic. The second sequence is
identification/recognition that was achieved by recognition of the answerer, i.e. by uttering the
answerer’s name that is different from Godard’s results. The researchers generalize that
summons/answer must occur first and then follow mutual recognition, which occurs in or after
answering the summons.
In contrast, Schmidt (1986) finds that telephone conversational openings of Egyptian Arabic
which is Cairene Arabic differ from French and Americans. He analyzes one sample that was taken
from a corpus of 215 telephone opening recorded in Egypt with no providing any information
about the participants and their relationship. Schmidt reveals that the caller used alo ‘hello’
responding to the alo of the answerer. Also, the answerer uses alo again in the third turn of the
conversation making a series of hellos that may occur with poor connection or when the answerer
picks up the receiver and does not say anything immediately. However, it occurs here as
demanding the caller to identify himself/herself. Schmidt comments by saying that identification
is problematic in Egypt because neither answerer nor caller provide any self-identification before
assuring the identity of each other. This strong reluctance from caller and callee indicates the
difference between Egyptians and Americans. In general, it is similar to Americans in terms of the
same categories of the sequences: summons answer, identification, greeting, and introduction of
message. Schegloff (1986) uses Schmidt’s Egyptian Arabic sample and suggests that the intercultural differences of opening organization are not strong.
However, like English and Spanish, Arabic is a pluricentric language, which encompasses
national varieties (Schneider & Barron, 2008); therefore, the researcher of this article assumes that
Lebanese Arabic and Cairene Arabic may not represent the social practices of all Arabic varieties.
For instance, the variety of American English (Halmari, 1993), British English (Sifanou, 1989),

and Spanish in Northern Mexico, Spain, and Paraguay (Hopper et al., 1991) display variation in
opening telephone. In American Business calls, for instance, Halmari (1993) reports that the
exchange of personal names is optional. Sifanou (1989) observes that, in England, callees recite
their names and sometimes their last names beside hallo. Although Hopper et al. (1991) ascertain
the universal structure of telephone openings, they acknowledge that the differences across
languages and cultures occur. For instance, Hopper et al. (1991) mention that Johnson, who is one
of the researchers in the study, conducts a survey on different Spanish-speaking countries: Bueno
(Northern Mexico), Digame (Spain), and Hola (Paraguay) and encounters differences in telephone
openings as they mention in the study. However, they do not provide the examples of the
differences. They justify their position on the grounds that the differences are similar in functions.
Similarly, Coronel-Molina’s study (1998) finds unique sequential variation in Spanish in Latin
American countries (Chile, Cuba, Mexico, Panama, Peru, and Puerto Rico) and insist in falling of
Hispanic conversational norms within Schegloff’s canonical schema of universalness.
Sifianou (1989) compares between British English and Greek in the sequences of opening
telephone calls. She mentions that answerers use ne ‘yes’ or verbs like speak and go ahead as a
summons answer in Greek, not like hello in the USA or hallo in England. Also, the results show
that Greek callers do not introduce themselves, i.e. no overt identification. In contrast, answerers
in England, recite their phone number and use self-identification that is sometimes offered by last
name. Furthermore, Sifianou (2002) also conducts another study on the same topic on Greek. She
states that the four canonical patterns occur when the relationship is distant between callers and
callees. In contrast, the frequent patterns between closely related interlocutors are only two main
sequences: summons answer and how-are-you. In formal relationship, self-identification follows
greeting, but greeting is considered not essential among intimates on telephone conversations.
Unlike Greek, Taleghani-Nikazm (2002) demonstrates that the four canonical sequences occur in
both formal and informal calls in Persian. Finally, the expressions of greetings like health to you
and health are used more frequently whereas good morning and good evening are used less
frequently in Greek.
Park (2002) examines recognition and identification in Japanese and Korean. The researcher
notes that they prefer self-identification over other recognition, which is often followed by the
reason of call. This preference is similar to Dutch (Houtkoop-Steenstra, 1991) and Swedish
(Lindstro¨m, 1994). Dutch begins the call with self-identification which is preferred by nick name,
first name only, last name only, marital status, or full title. Thus, Dutch people sometimes use
hello. However, Swedes use a variety of responses besides self-identification, which is used by
first or last name when answering the telephone. For example, they use other recognition, greeting
and self-identification, station identification (phone number) and halla ‘hello.’ Swedish is similar
to Americans in using other recognition and like Dutch in using self-identification. However, it is
unique that how are you is considered optional in Swedish. Houtkoop-Steenstra (2003) conducts
another study on Dutch but goes beyond analyzing the structure of opening of conversations in
isolation from the influence of social factors. She analyzes gender differences in terms of
identifications and the forms that they use for identifying themselves. She states that women use
hello to protect their privacy; thus, they withhold self-identification. However, the difference is
not significant in comparison with men. Another difference is that women say Mrs. Last name, but
no men say Mr. Last name. Houtkoop-Steenstra mentions that the background of this difference is

not clear. The same goal in terms of studying gender differences in opening telephone call is
examined by Grieve and Seebus (2008) in Australian and German. They illustrate that men use
self-identification more than women in business calls. It means that both males and females use
self-identification, but they differ in frequency.
In Chinese, Hopper and Chen (1996) find that the ordered tasks of Schegloff’s analysis occur
in telephone openings of Mandarin speakers in Taiwan: summons answer,
identification/recognition, and greeting pairs. Similarly, Taleghani-Nikazm (2002) reports the
same sequences of American telephone openings produced by Iranians in both formal and informal
calls. However, Hopper and Chen (1996) note a variety of greetings used based on the
interpersonal relationship between caller and callee in Chinses. For instance, intimates use tagparticle /a/ attached to names; whereas, non-intimates use the particle /ei/, and the particle ni hao
with unacquainted people. Intimate callers sometimes speak before the beginning of answerer,
which is rare. However, it is a phenomenon and used commonly in mobile phone calls (Hutchby
& Barnett, 2005). This result emerges against the first part of Schegloff’s rules which postulate
that the answerer speaks first, and then the caller provides the first topic. Besides using a variety
of greetings in Chinese, Sun (2004) observes that Chinese also use a variety of forms for inquiring
that are inadequate for English semantic categories of phatic talk.
In Persian, Taleghani-Nikazm (2002) shows that identification is affected by social status in
using forms. For instance, other identification is achieved by using last name preceded by an
address term. If the answerer knew the caller, the response will be alo salam ‘hello, peace’ in the
summons answer. In how-are-you sequence, inquiring is repeated by using different lexical items
to show interest in others. Like Persian, Saadah (2009) highlights the same repetition of how are
you in Arabic between family members to show more intimacy and interest in callees. Also, in
Hispanic etiquette, Coronel-Molina (1998) mentions that callers should inquire each other’s family
members to show his/her interest. However, when the relationship is not intimate, the plural you
is used instead of using the singular you in Persian. In contrast, Turjoman (2005) states that talking
to elders is addressed in plural to show respect for them in Saudi Arabic.
Grieve and Seebus (2008) work on Australian and German and compare between opening
private and business telephone calls. The results show that Germans use self-identification more
than Australians. Australians use self-identification more frequently in business than private calls.
Hello and hi salutations occur more in private calls than Business calls. Salutations, like hello and
hi, are used more than good morning and good evening. Australian callees include a salutation
more than Germans.
To sum up, the previous studies explore similarities and differences in the sequences and ritual
expressions of opening telephone conversations across cultures. In addition, opening is affected
by various factors such as language, culture, relationship, goal of call, etc. However, the majority
of explored differences of opening sequences still fall in Schegloff’s model irrespective of the
existence of all the four sequences of opening in general. Finally, even if the inter-cultural
differences are not strong (Schegloff, 1986) or the differences are similar in the function (Hopper
et al., 1991), they need to be studied to better understand other languages, but beyond the concept
of universalness.

Mobile Phone Calls
Social scientists have contributed to studying numerous areas related to the use of mobile
telephony in our social life, e.g. Brown, Green, and Harper (2002) and Katz and Aakhus (2002).
However, their concerns are beyond studying the nature of social practice; that is, talk in
interaction. Brown et al. (2002) focus on topics such as social and technical problems related to
the use of mobile phone and mobile communication. Katz and Aakhus’s volume (2002) rely on
interviews and questionnaires in most of the studies that are about mobile users and their
preferences for cell phones. Some other contributions are made by Murtagh (2002) and
Weilenmann and Larsson (2002) in analyzing the nature of interaction in mobile phone, but the
data are collected by ethnographic observation and informant report, not by recording. However,
there are a few conversation analysis studies that have been conducted on studying mobile phone
conversations by using recording to describe and analyze either recording or naturally occurring
data, such as Laurier (2001), Weilenmann (2003), Hutchby and Barnett (2005), Arminen and
Leinonen (2006), and Laursen and Szymanski (2013). Laurier (2001) examines the formulation of
location that are performed in mobile phones by traveling workers to other mobiles and non-mobile
office locations that are not related to this topic.
Weilenmann (2003) investigates not only the formulation of availability and location but also
the identification and recognition between teenage mobile users in Swedish. The researcher finds
that the sequence of identification and recognition is similar to the Swedish landline calls that are
described by Lindstro¨m (1994). For example, self-identification by name is also exist on mobile
phone, and there are no cases showing that the callee recited the name of caller due to the Caller
identification function that the researcher assumes its impact on identification.
Hutchby and Barnett (2005) compare mobile phone and landline calls focusing on pre-voice
identification and location inquiry in British data. They reveal that there are similarities and
differences in the sequences of openings. The differences indicate new interaction sequences in
routine conversations by mobile telephony. For example, an answerer can identify the caller by
the caller ID function, which is called “pre-voice sample caller identification,” and recite his/her
name instead of the summons answer. It means that it creates a new sequence in opening. This
result is not observed in Weilenmann’s results. Caller, in most of the cases in their data, speaks
first that is a result of certain technological affordances of mobile telephones. As mentioned in the
previous section, this phenomenon is similar to Mandarin speakers in Taiwan; however, it is
established that callers speak first between intimate partners in a large number of instances in
landline telephone (Hopper & Chen, 1996). According to Hopper and Chen (1996), “the
Taiwanese author/informant speculates that the caller speaks first to display some sense of
urgency” (p. 305). It is obvious that the phenomenon of callers in terms of speaking first is related
to mobile phone in the British data, but in Taiwan it is related to the culture. Finally, despite the
differences mentioned above, Hutchby and Barnett (2005) still claim that that the modifications
are not pervasive or obvious.
In contrast, Arminen and Leinonen (2006) confirm that the opening conversation of mobile
phone differs from opening in landline calls in Finnish, unlike Weilenmann (2003) and Hutchby
and Barnett (2005). Arminen and Leinonen notice that the sequences are reduced and the call starts
with greeting, which is canonical with known caller, and topic initiation in mobile phone call. In

landline, the call starts with self-identification, which is also exist in mobile phone when the caller
is unknown or the number is silent.
Another study is supporting the results of Arminen and Leinonen (2006) in terms of the
differences in general. Laursen and Szymanski’s results (2013) of mobile phone conversations
from the United States and Denmark point out that identification and recognition are infrequently
used when location inquiries are made. Also, they confirm that location talk is used frequently in
opening sequences as a reason for the call. In addition, they show that the organization of sequence
is as follows: greeting exchange, how-are-you exchange, and where-are-you inquiries or reports
of location. However, the extracts of their conversations display self-identification and other
recognition which is not clear whether the recognition is by voice sample or the caller ID because
the researchers do not investigate that. Probably, their focus is only on investigating the
formulation of location in mobile phone conversations.
Finally, the results of the previous studies show similarities and differences between mobile
and landline telephone in the sequences of opening in Swedish, British, Finish, United States, and
Denmark. Based on the limited number of studies on opening mobile phone conversations and the
different claims we have, there is a need for more studies to better understand this topic. Also, we
need to know whether the differences are related to the mobile phone or language and culture.
Greetings in Arabic
Studying the ritual expressions or formulas of greetings in Arabic have been examined widely
in face to face communication either in Saudi Arabia (e.g. Hassanain, 1994; Turjoman, 2005) or
in other Arabic speaking communities, e.g. Morocco (Mercier, 1957), Syria (Ferguson, 1976),
Yemen (Caton, 1986), Oman (Emery, 2000), Iraq and Jordan (Gorgis & Al-Quran, 2003), Jordan
(Hazaymeh, 2012; Darwish & Bader, 2014), and Gulf Arabic (Alharbi & Al-Ajmi, 2008).
Greetings have types that are listed by Hazaymeh (2012) such as religious, rural, morning/evening,
English, and marhaba ‘welcome’ and ahlan ‘welcome’ patterns. Choosing a particular type pattern
is affected by a number of factors, viz. environment, Islam, education, media, contact with the
West, and relations (Hazaymeh, 2012). The previous studies of greetings in Arabic indicate
similarities and differences in using the patterns of greetings and their frequency.
In the previous studies, almost all the results assure that the Islamic greeting assalaamu
ʕalaykum ‘Peace be upon you’ and its response wa alaikum assalam ‘Peace be upon you too’ are
most frequently used form in greeting (Ferguson, 1976; Caton, 1986; Hassanain, 1994; Emery,
2000; Gorgis & Al-Quran, 2003; Turjoman, 2005; Alharbi & Al-Ajmi, 2008; Hazaymeh, 2012;
Darwish & Bader, 2014). This short form of greeting can be used with a long form assalaamu
ʕalaykum wa rahmatu allah ‘(May) peace and God’s mercy be upon you’ or assalaamu ʕalaykum
wa rahmatu allah wa barakatuh ‘(May) peace and God’s mercy and blessings be upon you.’
Similarly, in response, the form can be performed like wa ʕalaykum assalaamu wa rahmatu allah
‘(May) peace and God’s mercy be upon you too’ or wa ʕalaykum assalaamu wa rahmatu allah wa
barakatuh ‘(May) peace and God’s mercy and blessings be upon you too.’ According to Turjoman
(2005), the latter form is only used by people who are over 50 in Saudi Arabia. Surprisingly,
Alharbi and Al-Ajmi (2008) find that the greeting form assalaamu ʕalaykum ‘Peace be upon you’

has a dual function; that is, it is used as a greeting and parting in Gulf Arabic, e.g. Kuwait, eastern
province of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the UAE and Oman.
Based on the Islamic principles and credo in the Holy Quran, Muslims must respond to the
greeting by better one or return it. Allah says “When you are greeted with a salutation then return
it with a better one, or at least the same. Surely Allah takes good count of everything” (The Holy
Quran, 4: 86). Although this greeting is only used by Muslims, Darwish and Bader (2014) report
that it is also used, but rarely, by Christians when greeting Muslims to show respect and solidarity
for them in Jordan. In Morocco, Mercier (1957) concedes that Muslims use the response wa
alaikum ‘And upon you too’ when they are greeted by non-Muslims1 (as cited in Ferguson, 1976).
In contrast, Gorgis and Al-Quran (2003) point out that the response wa alaikum is also used by
Iraqis and Jordanians. However, they provide no information about their participants, i.e. whether
they are Muslims or not to be able to identify the backgrounds of users for this greeting response.
In addition, Gorgis and Al-Quran (2003) discover that Iraqis and Jordanians use the greeting
form salam ‘Peace,’ and the same result also is asserted by Hazaymeh (2012) in Jordanian Arabic.
However, Turjoman (2005) emphasizes that form is used only by youngest age group and one
female middle age in Saudi Arabia. Also, it is proved in Yemeni greetings with a unique greeting
exchange. For instance, Caton (1986) remarks a unique exchange of greetings between tribesmen
in Yemen, e.g. salam tahiyah ‘Greetings of long life’ and its response that is ablag-t ‘I am fulfilled
or satisfied.’
The other common forms of greetings that are used in the mentioned Arabic speaking
communities are marhab ‘welcome’ and temporal or time bound greetings, e.g. sabah ilkhair
‘good morning’ and masa ilkhair ‘good evening’ (Ferguson, 1976; Caton, 1986; Emery, 2000;
Gorgis & Al-Quran, 2003; Hazaymeh, 2012; Alharbi & Al-Ajmi, 2008). Marhab ‘welcome’ is a
classical Arabic formula (Emery, 2000; Alharbi & Al-Ajmi, 2008), and it is sometimes used with
numbers that work as an intensifier for it, e.g. marhaba ‘welcome’ singular, marhabtain ‘two
welcomes’ dual, and marahib ‘(many) welcomes’ plural (Ferguson, 1976; Caton, 1986; Emery,
2000; Hazaymeh, 2012; Alharbi & Al-Ajmi, 2008). According to Alharbi and Al-Ajmi (2008),
marhaba is employed for greeting a visitor to the house, initiating a social encounter, or to draw
someone’s attention in Gulf Arabic. However, they are used to greet busy people like in Iraq and
Saudi Arabia. The intensified forms, as mentioned above, also are used as a response to marhaba
‘welcome’ or hala ‘welcome’ in some dialects like Najd in Saudi Arabia, Levantine, and Iraq
(Alharbi & Al-Ajmi, 2008).
The temporal greetings, e.g. sabah ilkhair ‘good morning’ and masa ilkhair ‘good evening,’
are also commonly used by these forms. In addition, they are used by adding Allah to them to
invoke God’s blessing on the addressee, e.g. massakum allah bilxer ‘(May) God bid you: good
evening’ or Allah ymassikum bilxer ‘my God bid you: good evening’ in Jordanian Arabic (Caton,
1986; Gorgis & Al-Quran, 2003; Alharbi & Al-Ajmi, 2008). The goal of adding Allah in this
greeting is to express more warmth and personalized sense instead of using sabah ilkhair that is
the formal one (Alharbi & Al-Ajmi, 2008). Furthermore, the temporal greetings are also used by
adding names of flowers or roses, e.g. sabah iIward ‘morning of roses’ and sabah ilfull ‘morning
of jasmine’ (Ferguson, 1976; Hazaymeh, 2012).

Conversation Analysis: Opening Sequences and Ritual Expressions

Mahzari

Emery (2000) examines the form of three categories of politeness formulas: greeting and
parting, congratulating and condoling in the northern Omani Arabic, and the social factors that can
affect language use, e.g. age and gender. He describes the sequences of opening encounter of a
visitor. He finds that there are three stages in greetings: greeting exchange, a health inquiry with
conventional answer and thanks to Allah, and ritualized news inquiry. It is obvious that greetings
are often the first utterance in the encounter in face to face interaction (Sifianou, 1989; Hopper &
Chen, 1996), whereas expressions like hello, yes, or self-identification are commonly used in
initiating telephone conversations, which may differ based on language and culture. Hello, for
instance, is also used as a greeting in both telephone and face to face encounter in English. The
main reason beyond the difference is that the mutual identification and recognition occurs visually
through pre-speech moments in face to face conversation; however, they are achieved verbally in
speech in a telephone conversation (Hopper & Doany, 1989; Hopper & Chen, 1996). This
difference between face to face talk and landline telephone has changed with the caller ID function
in which the caller can start with greeting because of the available information of caller, e.g.
Finish’s data (Arminen & Leinonen, 2006). However, the absence of non-linguistic cues is still
the main difference between these two types of communication (Sifianou, 1989; Hutchby &
Barnett, 2005).
To sum up, greeting formulas are loaded with sociocultural values and religious beliefs in
Arabic speech communities. In addition, the use of forms is affected by various factors, e.g. age,
gender, region, and religion.
Methodology
Research Questions:
1- What are the opening sequences and ritual expressions of mobile phone calls between
Saudis?
2- Are the opening sequences of mobile phone calls similar to or different from landline
telephone calls?
Participants
The participants are 32 Saudi friends and relatives, 20 males and 12 females. The majority of
participants were in their twenties and thirties with different educational backgrounds. All the male
participants are from the South and middle of Saudi Arabia (SA); however, the majority of them
live in the middle of the country. All the female participants are from the South, but the majority
live in the middle of SA. They represent Saudi Arabia in general and the middle and the south of
SA in particular.
All the Saudi male participants were in the United States at the time of recording except one
participant in Malaysia and three relatives in Saudi Arabia. All the Saudis who were in the United
States were graduate students except for two: one of them was an undergraduate student and the
other one was in the United States for non-degree study or other purposes (i.e., he was on a military
course in Texas). The Saudi participant in Malaysia was a graduate student. With regard to the
educational background of the other three relatives in Saudi Arabia, they have the General
Certificate of Secondary Education except one who has the Certificate of Intermediate Education.
All the females were in Saudi Arabia except for the researcher’s wife who was in the United States.

The females also differed in their educational backgrounds (e.g. eight females have the General
Certificate of Secondary Education, one female has the Certificate of Elementary Education, and
three females were illiterate).
Data
A corpus of thirty calls from mobile to mobile phone was recorded by a voice recorder program
in a mobile phone by the researcher, and two female assistants (his wife and sister). The
participants were invited to participate in this study because they were available for recording to
achieve the purpose of the study. Also, the goal was explained to the participants by calling the
relatives in Saudi Arabia and by sending text messages to the friends in the U.S.A. All of them
gave their consent for recording in advance except three participants gave the consent during the
call because they did not receive the text message. One of the Saudi males refused to participate
in this study, so he was excluded, and he is not included in the total number of male participants.
The calls were conducted with the same sex, i.e. the conversations were between men and between
women. All the names were anonymized by using random names for the participants except the
name of researcher in all the shown extracts in the results. All the calls were made just for saying
hello.
The researcher recorded all the men calls by Nokia N 96, and the researcher acknowledges that
he initiated 13 calls where he was a caller in them. In addition, the researcher was a callee in seven
calls where the calls were initiated by seven participants. The participants were 15 friends and five
relatives. 16 calls were domestic in the U.S.A, but four calls were international, e.g. three calls
were from the USA to Saudi Arabia, and one call was from the USA to Malaysia. By using the
same device, the researcher’s wife, the first assistant, recorded and initiated six international calls
from the USA to Saudi Arabia, where she was a caller in them. The second assistant, the
researcher’s sister, recorded and initiated four domestic calls by Galaxy Note One in Saudi Arabia.
The two assistants recorded all calls between female participants, who were only relatives of the
researcher.
The researcher transcribed only the part of opening and closing for the mobile calls by using
the convention transcription of Gail Jefferson (see Appendix A). Because of the limited space, the
researcher worked only on the opening part in this study. There are two lines for the transcript of
conversations. First, the top line indicates the original words of the caller or callee. Second, the
bottom line is the English translation of the original words. The data are research generated data,
not naturalistic data, because of the difficulty of recording naturalistic data. Therefore, the
researcher invited the participants to participate in the current study. The data were analyzed
qualitatively and quantitatively to achieve the goal of study.
Results
This part includes one main section: opening sequences and ritual expressions of mobile phone
conversations to display the results of analyzing the 30 informal mobile phone calls between Saudi
friends and relatives, i.e. 20 male conversations and 10 female conversations. The section shows
the sequences and ritual expressions of mobile phone conversations: summons answer sequence,
greeting exchange, identification/ recognition, and the sequence of “how are you.” The extracts of
conversations will be used to show the sequences and tables to show the ritual expressions that

were used in these sequences. The tables were divided in two parts: the left side shows the ritual
expressions used by the participants and the right side shows what was used by the data recorders,
i.e. the two female assistant and the researcher, to avoid the repetition that can influence the final
results of the frequency of ritual expressions.
Opening Mobile Phone Calls
Based on analyzing the sequences of opening mobile phone calls, it was found that the majority
of calls included only three sequences: summons answer, greeting exchanges, and the exchanges
of “how are you,” except 3 calls included the identification/recognition sequence beside the other
three sequences. Extract2 (11) shows an example for the common three sequences of opening
mobile phone calls in the data (the researcher was the callee in this call):

10 Callee: M

As shown in line one, the callee answered the call with alo ‘hello’ as a summons answer. In
turn 3 and 4, the caller and callee exchanged the greetings. The caller’s greeting was assalamu
alaykum ‘Peace be upon you’ that was responded by the callee, e.g. wa alaykum assalam wa
rahmatu allah wa barakatuh, ahlan wa sahlan ‘Peace and God's mercy and blessings be upon you
too, welcome, welcome.’ The final main sequence was how-are-you sequence as shown from line
6 to 10. In line 6, the caller asked the callee by saying kayf alhal ‘how are you?’ and the callee
responded by using a prayer and employing how are you at the end of his response in line 7, e.g.
allah yisallimk bashshirna ank ya abu fahad ‘(May) God keep you safe and sound, any good news
about you, father of Fahad?’ Father of Fahad is an address term for the caller, which was used as
a polite strategy with the caller. In line 9, the caller responded by saying wallah nizgah ‘I swear
by God, (we’re) fine.’ The positive response, i.e. nizgah was intensified by wallah to stress or
confirm the meaning of fine. In the same turn, the caller also employed another how are you inquiry
such as asakum tayibeen ‘I hope you are fine too.’ This form is often understood as a question
although it is affirmative with no question particle or intonation. In other words, the meaning of
inquiry for that form is are you fine? I hope you are fine. In turn 10, the callee responded to that

inquiry wallah abashshirk bkhair asak bkhair ‘I swear by God, the good news I tell you is that I
am fine, I hope you are fine too.’ Also, the callee used wallah to intensify the meaning of his
response, which is similar to what was used by the caller in line 9. In addition, the callee used the
word abashshirk which literally means ‘tell good news’ (English translation: ‘any good news to
tell about you’) but its meaning is used for telling good news. This extract reflects the majority of
opening sequences in the current study data as mentioned above with some examples for the ritual
expressions that were used in these sequences.
The results of examining the opening sequences for all the data will be shown in depth with
their extracts in the following sections: the summons answer sequence, greeting exchanges,
identification/recognition, and exchange of how are you. Also, the ritual expressions that were
used in each sequence will be identified. The first part will be about the summons answer sequence
and the expressions that were used as a summons answer.
Summons Answer Sequence
The mobile phone’s ring (i.e. the summons) and the answer of this summons constitute the first
adjacency pair of the first sequence in the mobile phone conversations. Based on analyzing the
opening sequences of the 30 mobile phone calls, the researcher noticed that the callees/answerers
answered the mobile phone call in three different ways: using greeting, hello, and reciting the name
of caller by using an address term as a summons answer (see Table 1).
Table 1 shows the ritual expressions used as a summons answer by participants and data
recorders when they were answerers in the calls. The total number of conversations that have
summons answer was 27 conversations. The total number of conversations, where the participants
were answerers, were 20 conversations (13 for male and seven for female participants). In the other
three female conversations, the female data recorders spoke first by exchanging greetings
immediately, so there was no summons answer in that conversations. Finally, there were seven
conversations where the researcher was an answerer, not a caller, and the researcher coded himself
as “male data recorder” (see Table 1).

The callee answered the summons using the greeting marhaba. Then the caller followed that
summons answer by another greeting assalamu alaykum ‘Peace be upon you’ in line 3. This
greeting is not a response to marhaba in this case. As a result, this greeting, i.e. assalamu alaykum,
was responded to by the answerer wa alaykum essalam wa rahmatu allah ‘Peace and God's mercy
be upon you too’ in line 5. This greeting is considered as a main greeting that will be examined in
the coming section, which is about greeting exchanges, for more details. In another conversation,
a callee answers the call by using another form of greeting, e.g. hala ‘welcome.’ This greeting is
similar to marhaba in the meaning ‘welcome,’ but it differs in the form, as shown in line 3 in

Sometimes the name of caller or his/her address term is added to the greeting. In the following
sample of conversation, the callee answered the call using the greeting hala, followed by the
address term of the caller abu Abdulelalh ‘father of Abdulelah’ in line 2. Also, it is an example of
the impact of caller ID in which the callee could identify the caller before opening the line.

Although the majority of participants used the greeting hala/marhaba as a summons answer
(55%), followed by hello (40%), and reciting the address term of the caller (5%). It was found that
there was a major difference between male and female participants in the frequency of using that
greeting, as shown in Table 1. Male participants used the greeting hala/marhaba as a summons
answer more frequently (72%) than female participants (27%).
According to Table 1, alo was the second most frequent expression of the summons answer,
after the frequency of greeting hala/marhaba that was used by the participants (40%). Also, it was
used by the researcher as a summons answer in all the six conversations, where the researcher was
an answerer/callee. The following sample of conversation shows the use of alo as a summons
answer (see line 1). It was followed by exchanging greeting in line 2 and 3.

However, the female data recorders did not use any summons answers because they were callers
in all the conversations. In other words, they were not answerers in any call. The frequency of data
recorders’ expressions will not be discussed because they indicate their repetition in the calls. A
new phenomenon was found in some conversations where the caller speaks first. However, it
occurred only with the data recorders, which may indicate the personal style when talking on
mobile phone (see Extract 6).

Callee: Shahad

The caller spoke first by using alo followed by the greeting assalamu alaykum ‘Peace be upon
you.’ The callee responded that greeting by saying hala ‘welcome’ and also started the sequence
of how are you, for example kayfik. The other two samples, where the data recorders spoke first,
are similar to the previous sample, i.e. conversation 29. In these exceptional cases of female data
recorders, the sequences were reduced to greeting and how are you exchanging. Finally, both male
and female participants were equal in the frequency of using alo as a summons answer (50%).
In contrast, there was only one case (5%) in which the callee answered the call by reciting the
address term of the caller, e.g. abu Abdulelah ‘father of Abdulelah’ in conversation 3 (see line 1).

In his conversation, it is obvious from line 2, 3, 4, and 5 that there was a problem in the
connection. Therefore, the callee used the address term of caller probably in order to assure that
the caller was on the line.
To sum up, this part displayed three ways of answering the summons. Using greeting like
hala/marhaba was the most frequent one, followed by hello and reciting the address term of the
caller. The male participants tended to use greetings as a summons answer more than females.
However, they were equal in the use of hello to answer the call. The following part is about the
next adjacency pair, which is greeting exchanging.
Greeting Exchanges
In the previous section, the results showed a type of greeting, e.g. hala/marhaba that was used
as a summons answer, but it received no greeting response from the caller. However, a caller uses
a greeting, e.g. assalamu alaykum ‘Peace be upon you’ in the next turn which is the adjacency pair
of the greeting exchanges that receives a greeting response.

According to Table 2, three forms of greeting were used by the participants when they were
callers in seven conversations, e.g. assalamu alaykum ‘Peace be upon you,’ salam/assalam
‘Peace,’ assada allah misak ‘(May) God make your evening happy,’ and marhaba ‘welcome.’ In
addition, one female callee answered the call by using hello and greeting, e.g. alo salam ‘hello,
peace’ which means that she initiated the greeting exchanging first rather than the caller.
As shown in Table 2, the greeting expression assalamu alaykum ‘Peace be upon you’ was used
by the participants more frequently (62%) than the other greeting forms, e.g. salam/assalam (12%),
assada allah misak (12%), and marhaba (12%). Moreover, the other forms of greeting expressions
did not show significant differences in the frequency of use. As a result, they were only used 12%.
It means that there was a preference for using assalamu alaykum among the male participants. All
the female participants, on the other hand, were callees; therefore, they did not initiate any greeting
except one female callee that was explained above. It is obvious that the female greetings were
only initiated by the two female recorders such as assalamu alaykum and salam/assalam. The
following sample shows the use of the most frequent greeting expression (see line 4) and the
response (see line 5):

All the data recorders used the same greeting expressions except assada allah misak and marhaba,
which were used only by male participants. On the other hand, the greeting salam/assalam was
only used by women, i.e. one female participant and female data recorders. The participants used
various greeting responses to the greetings of assalaamu ʕalaykum ‘Peace be upon you,’
salam/assalam ‘Peace,’ assada allah misak ‘(May) God make your evening happy’ and marhaba
‘welcome’ (see Table 3). The following table, Table 3, shows both greeting forms and their

According to Table 3, the greeting response wa alaikum assalam ‘Peace be upon you too’ was the
most frequent response (35%) for the greeting assalaamu alaykum 'Peace be upon you' or
salam/assalam ‘Peace,’ followed by wa alaykum assalaamu wa rahmatu allah ‘Peace and God’s
mercy be upon you too’ (30%). For the same greeting, there were two greeting responses used less
frequently by the participants, e.g. wa alaykum assalaamu wa rahmatu Allah wa barakatuh ‘Peace
and God’s mercy and blessings be upon you too’ (20%), followed by hala ‘welcome’ (15%). The
other two greetings: assada Allah misak and marhaba were only responded by the male data
recorder. For instance, assada Allah misak was responded by wa masaaka bi kuli khair ‘And may
(He) make all your evening good,’ and marhaba was responded by hala.
Moreover, the results indicate some preferences between the two groups: male and female
participants in terms of using some greeting responses. First of all, wa alaikum assalam was used
more frequently (71%) by female participants than male participants (28%). In contrast, male
participants used wa alaykum assalaamu wa rahmatu Allah more frequently (83%) than female

participants (16%). It is obvious that the male participants tended to use the long form of this
greeting response, which is quite similar to the following greeting in terms of the frequency of use,
e.g. wa alaykum assalaamu wa rahmatu Allah wa barakatuh (100%). This long form of greeting
response was not used by anyone from the female participants.
Some participants tended to employ more than one greeting response in the same turn. As
shown in line 3 in the following sample of conversation, the callee responded the greeting by
adding hala wallah ‘welcome, (I swear) by God’ to wa alaykum essalam ‘Peace be upon you too.’
Wallah means ‘I swear by God,’ but it is a discourse marker that was used to intensify the meaning
of welcome. The goal of using more than one greeting expression and the discourse marker as an
intensifier is usually to show more intimacy for the addressee (see line 3 in Extract 2).

In extract 3, the sample shows the same linguistic behavior by adding more than one greeting
response; however, the form of greeting response that was added to the main greeting differs from
the previous one. The added greeting response was hayyak Allah ‘(May) God greet you’ (see line

The researcher observed that after finishing the first adjacency pair of greeting exchanges, it
was found that the researcher tended to employ another greeting in the next turn, where he was a
caller in 10 conversations. This greeting, for instance, was masaa alkhair (singular)/ masa
alkhairat (plural) ‘Good evening’ and massak Allah bilkhair ‘(May) God make your evening

of the Saudi society.
Surprisingly, one of the callers from the male participants used the same way of greeting in a
call when the researcher was an answerer. He employed two greetings in two different turns as
shown in the following sample in line 2 and 4.

In line 2, the caller used the greeting assalaamu alaykum that was responded to by the callee
in line 3. In line 4, again the caller employed another greeting massak Allah bilkhair that was
responded to by the callee in line 5. This form of greeting was also received through various
responses from the male participants. Table 4 shows the responses of good evening.

According to Table 4, the participants used various greeting responses to the various greeting
forms of good evening that were initiated by the researcher in 10 conversations. The first greeting
masaa alkhair ‘good evening’ (singular)/ masa alkhairat (plural) are more formal than massak
Allah bilkhair ‘(May) God make your evening good.’ The participants used various expressions as
a greeting response to them. For example, the greeting responses hala/ hala wmasshala/ ya
marhaba ya ahlan ‘welcome/ welcome, welcome’ were used more frequently (30%) than masaa
alkhairat (10%) and masaa almasarrat ‘happy evenings’ (10%) as a response to the greeting
masaa alkhair/ masa alkhairat. The following various forms: hala/ hala wmasshala/ ya marhaba
ya ahlan mean ‘welcome/ welcome, welcome’ in English; however, they differ in the form in
general.
For the other greeting form massak Allah bilkhair, the participants also used various responses
that did not show any significant differences in the frequency of use. Finally, this form of greeting
was not used by the female participants. In all the conversations, it was discovered that
identification/ recognition occurred after exchanging greetings. Therefore, the next part is about
identification/recognition.
Identification/Recognition
All the conversations showed that the callee could identify the callers by the caller ID when the
name appeared on it in the data, except for three examples where the callees identified the caller
by voice recognition. The researcher was a callee in these three conversations. The first sample
(16) shows an example to the sequence of identification/ recognition. This call was an international
call between two male relatives:

the number did not appear on the caller ID, so he waited for two seconds to be able to recognize
the voice of caller3. In line 5, he interrupted himself and returned the greeting. Based on that selfinterruption, the callee was going to respond the greeting by wa alaykum assalam, but he shifted
to another greeting response which was hala. At the same time, he uttered the first name of the
caller, which means that the identification was achieved by other recognition, e.g. reciting the
caller’s first name.
Similarly, the following sample of conversation (18) was also an international call between two
relatives. The callee could not identify the caller from the beginning although he used the greeting
expression hala ‘welcome’ in line 2. When the caller greeted him by saying assalamu alaykum
‘Peace be upon you’ in line 2, there was a three second pause before he responded that greeting.
In line 4, the callee responded the greeting loudly and uttered the first name of the caller at the end
of greeting. It is similar to the previous sample in which the identification was achieved by other
recognition.

The last sample of conversation (14) was between two friends in the USA, but in two different
states. Although the researcher had sent him a text message informing him about his call and study,
the callee did not receive it4. The callee could not identify the caller from the caller ID; however,
he recognized the caller by his voice. Therefore, the callee started using various greeting
expressions in line 6 confirming the recognition. In this line, also, the expressions were stretched
out loudly.

To sum up, identification was achieved by other recognition, not self-identification. Also, it
occurred after the exchange of greetings by using the first name of the caller. Recognition could
be achieved without mentioning the name of caller as occurred in conversation 14. Finally, the last
main sequence of opening informal mobile phone calls was exchanging how are you. It often
transpires after greeting exchanges and identification/ recognition.
How Are You Exchanging
This sequence usually includes one or two sequences and sometimes more based on the goal of
call. Various expressions were used for asking about well-being and their responses. It means that
caller or callee sometimes tend to employ more than one question in one turn. For this sequence,
the researcher analyzed only the first caller’s turn of the well-being question and his/her response
to the answerer’s question of well-being. Also, the researcher followed the same way of analysis
with the answerer, i.e. the researcher analyzed the first turn of answerer’s response to the caller’s
well-being question and the first turn of his/her well-being question. The reason for this is that the
goal of this study is to identify the opening sequences, not the how are you sequences. In the first
table (Table 5), the results will show only the expressions of well-being questions. In the second
table (Table 6), the researcher will show both the expressions of well-being questions and their
responses. In this section, the researcher is only using tables with no sample of conversations
because the adjacency pairs of how are you extended to more than two and three turns, and even
more than that in some calls due to the goal of call that is to say hello.

As shown in Table 5, various expressions were used by the participants asking each other about
well-being. However, not all of these forms are interrogative forms like kaif assihah ‘how is your
health?,’ kaif amoorkum/alamoor ‘How are things going?,’ ishloonak/kaif alhal ‘how are you?,’
and aish msawwi ‘what are you doing?’ Some forms are imperative forms, e.g. bashshirna annak/
bashshirna an alakhbar which literally mean ‘tell us good news about you’ (English translation:
‘Any good news to tell about you?’ In addition, akhbarak or akhbarkum (plural) which literally
mean ‘your news’ (English translation: ‘what are you up to?’ is used as a question without using
intonation or a question particle. It is a result of its frequent use; thus, asking the addressee about
his/her news or his/her family’s news was the most frequent expression used by the participants
(47%). Sometimes it is used as singular, e.g. akhbarak or as plural akhbarkum. The other
interrogative forms, e.g. ishloonak/kaif alhal ‘how are you?’ or even about family were used
(33%). That was the most second frequent form, followed by bashshirna annak/ bashshirna an
alakhbar (8%) and kaif amoorkum/alamoor (8%). However, the form bashshirna annak/
bashshirna an alakhbar is imperative. The other expression, e.g. ish msawwi ‘what are you doing?’
was only used (2%), and it did not show any significant differences in terms of the frequency.
Finally, the male data recorder also used most of the expressions except the form of kaif/ishloon
‘how’ and aish msawwi ‘what are you doing.’ On the other hand, the female data recorders used
only akhbarik ‘what are you up to?’ and kaifik ‘how are you?’
The frequency of asking about news shows no significant differences between male (52%) and
female participants (47%). In contrast, the preference was in using ishloonak/kaif alahal ‘how are
you?’ form. The male participants used this form (83%) more than the females (16%). It means
that male participants preferred asking by using ‘how are you’ (83%) and about the addressee’s
news (52%). On the other hand, females preferred asking about news (47%) more than ‘how are
you’ (16%). Table 6 shows the results of the responses to these well-being questions (see Appendix
B).
Despite the various responses in Table 6, it was noticed that thanking God, e.g. alhamdulellah,
was the most frequent response used by the participants in almost all the well-being questions or
the ways of inquiring. For instance, it was used with the well-being questions, e.g. How is it going
for your family/kids? (23%), any good news (to tell) about you/any good news? (13%), how are
things going? (10%), and how is your health (3%). As shown in the Table, there are various
linguistic forms meant ‘thank god,’ e.g. alhamdulellah, Allah humma laka alhamd, or
nahmedallah, which are usually followed by wnashshkurah ‘we thank him (God).’ These forms
of thanking God, e.g. Allah humma laka alhamd and nahmedallah wnashshkurah are used to
intensify the meaning of thanking God.
The other responses like bkhair/tayybeen ‘fine,’ tamam ‘perfect’ were used more frequently;
however, the frequency did not show significant differences in the use. Usually, these expressions,
i.e. fine and good, followed or preceded by one of the expressions of thanking God. It is obvious

that almost all the responses were positive, which are usually expected in routine expressions. In
addition, there is no strong relation between the way of asking by using the various questions of
well-being and their responses, as shown in Table 6. In other words, the responses were often the
same, in general, in terms of the meaning, e.g. thanking God, fine, and good.
To sum up, while examining the sequences of informal mobile phone calls, it was found that
the caller ID function affected the sequences of opening, where the caller could identify the caller
before answering the call. Therefore, the identification/recognition sequence occurred only in three
calls when the name of caller did not appear on the callee’s mobile phone screen. In addition, the
sequence of identification/recognition occurred after exchanging greetings. It means that the
majority of informal mobile phone calls included only three sequences: summons answer, greeting
exchanges, and how are you exchanges. Furthermore, although the majority of calls were initiated
by using hala/marhaba greeting as a summons answer by participants, the sequence of greeting
exchanges still exists.
Discussion
This study aimed to examine and identify the opening sequences and ritual expressions of informal
mobile phone calls between Saudi friends and relatives. Another goal was to identify the
similarities and differences between mobile phone and landline telephone due to the earlier claims
in general on this topic and dearth of studies on Arabic in particular. In this study, caller ID function
played an important role in influencing the opening sequences in terms of
identification/recognition sequence as Schegloff (2002) wonders that effect. As a result, the
majority of opening sequences was reduced to three sequences: a summons answer, greetings
exchange, and how are you exchange. The main reason for this was that the answerer could identify
the caller before answering the call. Therefore, the four sequences were observed only in three
calls when the caller information did not appear on the answerer’s caller ID, e.g. a summons
answer, greetings exchange, identification/recognition, and how are you exchange. The
identification/ recognition sequence occurred after greeting exchanges by other recognition, i.e.
the answerer could identify the caller by his voice by uttering his first name. It occurred only in
three calls where the researcher was a caller in all of them and expected that his phone number
would appear for the callees because they have it. However, for technical problems, his phone
number did not appear to them. The researcher may find self-identification in a call if the caller
knows that his/her number is not with the answerer or he/she is unknown for the callee (Arminen
& Leinonen, 2006). The mobile phone opening sequences show similarities and differences with
the earlier studies on Arabic landline calls in general and mobile phone calls in particular.
For instance, the majority of sequences were reduced to three sequences in the mobile phone
calls in this study, whereas the dominance of four sequences were observed in Lebanese Arabic as
universal structure (Hopper & Doany, 1989) and Egyptian Arabic (Schmidt, 1986) in the landline
calls irrespective of the variety of Arabic. In addition, although the four sequences were shown
to be rare in this study, they differ in the order with Schmidt’s results, e.g. a summons answer,
identification, greeting, and introduction of message. Obviously, the identification was achieved
after the summons answer sequence; nevertheless, it was found after greeting exchanging in
mobile phone call. Another important difference was that the summons answer was frequently
used by alo ‘hello’ in Arabic landline calls (Hopper and Doany, 1989). In contrast, some greetings,

e.g. marhaba/hala ‘welcome’ were used as a summons answer which occurred more frequently
(55%) than alo (40%) in the calls of mobile phone. This result is supported by the participants
because they were answerers in most of the calls. It means that the greeting has two functions at
the same time in the first sequence of opening: greeting and a summons answer. However, alo
works only as a summons answer in Arabic, which differs from hello in English as it has various
functions, e.g. a summons answer, greeting, etc. (Schegloff, 1968). The researcher considered
marhaba/ hala as a summons answer by greeting in the analysis because the summons answer was
followed by the sequence of greeting exchanges, e.g. assalamu alaykum and the response wa
alaykum assalam. The initiation of greeting and how-are-you sequence were initiated mostly by
the two female assistants and the researcher as callers, so this may weaken the significance of this
result. Despite the differences between Arabic studies in landline and the current study due to the
caller ID, the sequences still fall in Schegloff’s structure irrespective of the existence of all or some
of the four sequences or the orders. This brief comparison is related to Arabic studies on landline,
which was justified by the influence of caller ID. This result, i.e. the caller ID effect, agrees with
some results of the previous mobile phone studies.
For instance, Hutchby and Barnett (2005) found that there is an impact of caller ID; thus, the
answerer recited the name of caller in most cases in their data instead of using hello as a summons
answer. This result showed the effect of caller ID. However, this way of answering the call was
only in one case in the results of the current study, which was a result of mobile phone network
problem. In addition, the phenomenon of callers speaking first was observed only in a number of
cases with data recorders in the data. This phenomenon was explained by Hutchby and Barnett
(2005) as a result of the influence of using mobile phone because they found the phenomenon in
most of the cases in the data. However, it is difficult to generalize that result due to the feature of
using mobile phone because it was also observed in a large number of calls between intimate
friends in a landline study in Mandarin in Taiwan (Hopper & Chen, 1996). It can be explained by
culture if there is no technical problem in the network or a delay from the answerer to speak first
after opening the line (Schegloff, 1968).
The results of reduced sequences support Arminen and Leinonen’s study (2006) because they
found out that the sequences were reduced to greeting and topic initiation in mobile phone calls in
Finish irrespective of the number of sequences. Although that result is similar to the result of
current study in terms of the beginning with greeting, the difference of greeting was in function.
In other words, the Finish mobile calls begin with exchanging greetings, but the Saudi mobile calls
are often initiated with greeting as a summons answer, not for exchanging the greeting. In the same
way of reducing the sequences and beginning with greeting, Laursen and Szymanski’s results
(2013) are similar to the current results in terms of reducing the sequences in general, e.g.
greetings, how are you, and where are you. However, the difference is that the beginning with
greeting, which is similar to Arminen and Leinonen’s study, is in the last sequence (where are
you), which is related to future meeting between caller and callee. Although the general similarities
that were found in the sequences between the previous studies on mobile phone calls and the
current study, there is one study that the present results contrast with it in terms of the absent
impact of the caller ID on identification. Weilenmann (2003) reported that callers begin with selfidentification and there was no case about reciting the name of caller due to the caller ID in
Swedish, which is similar to Swedish landline identification (Lindstro¨m, 1994). Probably, it is a

matter of culture in Swedish. Generally speaking, the previous and current results show similarities
and differences in the sequences of opening mobile phone calls and landline calls except the
sequence of where are you? due to its mobility.
The opening sequences showed various ritual expressions; however, most of them are religious
expressions such as assalamu alaykum and wa alaykum assalam (in greeting exchanges) and
thanking God as a response for most of the well-being questions. The previous routines were the
most frequent religious expressions used by the participants as a result of the Islamic principles
derived from the Holy Quran in Saudi Society. The participants used various forms of inquiry,
which are similar to Chinese (Sun, 2004) in terms of varieties of forms, in the how are you
sequence such as a khbarak ‘what are you up to?’ kaifik/ishloon alahal ‘how are you/how is your
family,’ bashshirna annak ‘any good news (to tell) about you?’ that have different literal
meanings. However, they mean how are you irrespective of the literal meaning; thus, the responses
of these inquiries were generally similar, e.g. thank God, fine, or good. It is obvious that there is
no relation between the form of inquiry and the way of response to it. Sometimes the well-being
questions are used repetitively to show more intimacy and interest in the caller and his/her family
(Coronel-Molina, 1998; Taleghani-Nikazm, 2002; Saadah, 2009). Some expressions were used in
plural although the addressee, i.e. caller or callee was singular, e.g. akhbarkum ‘what are you up
to? (plural),’ ishloonkum ‘how are you (plural),’ kaif amoorkum ‘how are they going?’. They are
used in plural to show more interest in the caller or callee. In contrast, they are used in formal calls
in Persian (Taleghani-Nikazm, 2002). Finally, gender variable showed some similarities and
differences in the ritual expressions and frequency which can be interpreted as a result of the
different regional and educational background between the males and females.
Conclusion
This study examined the conversations of informal mobile phone calls in terms of the opening
sequences and ritual expressions. It was found that the caller ID affected the sequences by reducing
them to three sequences: the summons answer, greeting exchange, and how are you exchange.
They were used more frequently without the identification/ recognition sequence that appeared
only in three cases by other recognition, e.g. first name. The main difference between mobile phone
and telephone is the absence of the identification/recognition sequence that occurs when the
number is silent or caller is unknown. Most of the ritual expressions in the sequences were religious
expressions that could constitute a major difference across cultures. Males and females used
various expressions that showed similarities and differences in the use of expression and
frequency. This study faced some limitations and had some suggestions for further research. One
limitation is the narrow scope of the data used, the limited number of participants, and the
repetition of recorders, i.e. the two female assistants and the researcher in this study. In addition,
Saudi women cannot be recorded easily by strange male researchers due to some high privacy in
the society; however, female researchers have a strong chance to record them to investigate more
ritual expressions based on the factor of gender differences in depth. Therefore, the researcher
recorded only his relatives. The researcher also suggests that further researchers should enlarge
the number of participants and record naturalistic data. Moreover, further studies should examine
Saudi landline calls with and without caller ID to identify and understand more the opening
sequences.

Footnotes
1
The researcher relied on Ferguson for that reference because it was written in French.
2
The number of extract indicates its sequence in the data, but not its sequence in the paper.
3
In some international calls, the researcher found that some relatives ask him whether he changed
his American phone number because it appeared to them differently, i.e. with a Saudi/domestic
phone number.
4
In this call, the callee, the researcher’s friend, told him that he lost his phone number.
