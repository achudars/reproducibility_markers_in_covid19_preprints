Abstract
Economic transactions on online peer-to-peer platforms depend on buyers and sellers revealing personal information to facilitate exchanges with the unintended consequence that the information may become a source for discrimination. Using original panel data we show evidence of substantial discrimination against Arab/Muslim hosts in Airbnb’s online rental market in Paris, France. Analysis of 41-months
of online transaction data shows a substantial increase in discrimination following large-scale, deadly terrorist attacks in November 2015. Discrimination results in a foregone monthly revenue of at least 106 US
dollars for Arab/Muslim hosts in the year before the November 2015 attacks, after which losses increase
to at least 178 US dollars. Our results demonstrate the association of mass terrorism with a contraction of
a large-scale market of the sharing economy, the cost of which falls disproportionately upon members of
an ethnic and religious minority.

Introduction
The last two decades have been marked by the increase in frequency, lethality and visibility of Islamist
terrorism in Western countries. An inevitable question is what influence the trend has on discrimination
against individuals of Arab and Muslim descent. Terrorist attacks are rare, idiosyncratic and geographically situated local events. Their direct effect on discrimination in the general population is difficult to tell
apart from the effect of alternative factors associated with changes in, among others, economic conditions
(Legewie, 2013), media coverage and political discourse (Spilerman and Stecklov, 2009; Bail, 2012). Consequently, researchers focus on the short temporal window around terrorist attacks. The evidence points to
their effect on anti-immigrant sentiment and Arab-related prejudices (Echebarria-Echabe and FernándezGuede, 2006; Finseraas and Listhaug, 2013; Legewie, 2013) whose repercussions have been shown, albeit
not consistently (Braakmann, 2010), to disadvantage individuals of Arab-Muslim descent in the housing
(Gautier et al., 2009; Ratcliffe and von Hinke, 2015) and labour markets (Dávila and Mora, 2005; Kaushal
et al., 2007; Glover, 2019; Rabby and Rodgers, 2011). But the evidence does not link the effect directly
and systematically to an increase in discrimination practices and the focus on the immediate aftermath of
terrorist attacks leaves open the question of whether the observed effects have long-term consequences.
In this study we show evidence of a direct effect of terrorism on discrimination against Arab/Muslim
individuals with a lasting fallout. Using panel data on a large-scale online market for temporary vacation
rentals in the French capital, Paris, we record non-negligible levels of discrimination throughout the year
prior to large-scale, multi-sited deadly terrorist attacks in November 2015. After this time point, we measure
a sizeable increase in discrimination whose level persists beyond the recovery of the market to pre-attacks
levels and until our last data point in April 2018, two and a half years following the tragic events1 . Our
findings have added importance given that they reveal the impact of terrorism on weakly institutionalised,
daily exchanges between mostly private individuals in a sector of the economy, the peer-to-peer online
market, which has grown to involve millions of individuals worldwide.
In the following pages, we begin with a brief description of recent evidence on day-to-day discrimination
in the sharing economy. A subsequent section situates our study in the literature on the effects of terrorism.
The rest of the paper develops around the analysis of the empirical evidence in data on a large online market
for temporary vacation rentals.

Discrimination in the Sharing Economy
The sharing economy is expanding to ever more aspects of social life. At the same time evidence
that online markets provide platforms for day-to-day discrimination between strangers is also growing.
Systematic discrimination in the traditional economy is a staple finding of social science research (Pager
and Shepherd, 2008; Rich, 2014; Quillian et al., 2017). The sharing economy differs in two important
ways however: first, it facilitates market exchanges between mostly private individuals, and second, the
conclusion of an exchange is facilitated by seller and buyer revealing personal information. This information
offers otherwise unobservable cues about the quality and experience of the marketed good or service and
about the trustworthiness of the exchange (Diekmann et al., 2014; Abrahao et al., 2017). On certain online
platforms like the product market eBay, revealed personal information during an exchange is minimal and
not necessarily mutual, though still a source susceptible to produce discrimination (Nunley et al., 2011;
Doleac and Stein, 2013; Ayres et al., 2015). But on peer-to-peer services, which involve the sharing of
intimate personal space, during a commute for example, or the temporary rental, for instance, of one’s
vehicle or living quarters, the incentive for sellers and buyers to reveal, voluntarily and mutually, extensive
personal information is so high as to become an essential feature of these market exchanges.
The spectacular growth of online peer-to-peer markets over the last decade results in hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide, who participate in market exchanges whereby they make choices based
on the personal information of other private individuals. Absent sufficient legal safeguards (Todisco, 2015;
Leong and Belzer, 2017; Calo and Rosenblat, 2017) these choices are susceptible to reproduce long-standing
prejudices and inequalities with economic consequences that disadvantage individuals on the basis of their

in Paris and the city’s northern suburb, Saint-Denis, caused the death of 130 people including more than 350 injured, almost 100 of
whom seriously. The attacks, for which the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed responsibility, were the second deadliest in
the European Union since the Madrid train bombings in 2004. Of the nine immediate perpetrators of the attacks, two were Iraqis, the
others were French and Belgian citizens.

gender, class, race, ethnicity and religion (Abrahao et al., 2017). A growing list of studies of such online
peer-to-peer platforms offers evidence on the troubling extent of observed day-to-day discrimination.
Consider a few telling examples. A field experiment of riding services by transportation companies Uber
and Lyft in two large U.S. cities found longer waiting time and higher cancellation rates for passengers who
use African American sounding names as well as longer, more expensive rides for female passengers (Ge
et al., 2016). In a similar vein analysis of the data of a German ride-sharing company found a discriminatory
price premium of 32% for passengers with typically Arab, Persian or Turkish names (Tjaden et al., 2018).
Several studies of the short-term rental company Airbnb showed lower acceptance rates in large U.S. cities
for guests with African American names (Edelman and Luca, 2014; Cui et al., 2016) , lower rental price
rates for apartments of African American hosts in New York City (Edelman and Luca, 2014) and lower
rental prices for Asian and Hispanic hosts in San Francisco (Kakar et al., 2018).
Edelman’s findings on discrimination are an important reference for our study because we also analyse
data from an Airbnb market, in our case the market in the French capital Paris. His precursory work,
along with the aforementioned subsequent studies, illustrates that discriminatory practices on the basis of
racial and ethnic identity, for which there is extensive historical evidence in the context of the traditional
housing market in the United States (Massey, 2005; Pager and Shepherd, 2008), take place, at equally
troubling levels, in daily exchanges between private individuals in the much more recent sharing economy
of short-term vacation rentals. Notwithstanding differences in both institutions and in ethnic composition
of minorities in Europe, there, too, exists extensive evidence of discrimination in national housing markets
(Flage, 2018), including the French one (Acolin et al., 2016; Bunel et al., 2017, 2018; Le Gallo et al., 2018).
Bridging evidence from both continents, a recent study of Airbnb from six U.S., three Canadian and ten
West European large or capital cities, including Paris, shows that Edelman’s findings extend beyond the
American case and apply, with comparable amplitude, to Arab/Muslim individuals, North American and
European alike (Laouénan and Rathelot, 2017).
Discrimination in these Airbnb studies refers to observed differences between individuals whose ethnoracial origin is inferred from names which are stereotypically associated with a particular origin. Correspondence audit studies, which track discrimination through the count of positive responses to rental requests
by fictitious Airbnb guests, suffer from potential bias due to association of social status with unique names
(Gaddis, 2017). Studies using panel data on real Airbnb hosts, which measure discrimination based on
variation in rental prices, limit the bias in so far as the data allow for the inclusion of controls for the characteristics of Airbnb listings. These capture elements of hosts’ socio-economic status, among other potential
determinants of a client’s choice, associated with geographic location, rental availability and quality and
reviews from previous guests. The addition of controls reduces observed raw differences significantly but
does not erase completely the price gap, whose estimates range from 12% in New York City (Edelman and
Luca, 2014) and 8 to 10% in San Francisco (Kakar et al., 2018). Laouénan and Rathelot (2017) arrive at a
lower overall estimate of 3.2% but their data originate from a considerably more heterogeneous population
from sixteen cities and nine countries. A lingering question remains about whether the estimates reflect a
taste for discrimination (i.e., racism) or statistical discrimination whereby clients use hosts’ names as proxy
for otherwise unobservable qualities of rentals between ethno-racial groups. Laouenan and Rathelot attribute three-quarters of the remaining price gap to statistical discrimination. Notwithstanding the variation
in estimates across studies, the evidence appears conclusive as to the presence of systematic ethno-racial
discrimination in the Airbnb market for temporary vacation rentals.

Terrorism’s Effects on Discrimination
The presence of discriminatory practices in the sharing economy, the Airbnb market in particular, however consistent the evidence is across cities and ethno-racial minorities, leaves open the question of the
likelihood of them increasing under the influence of a terrorist attack. The findings of recent research on
the topic may seem to tilt the balance towards an affirmative answer. Studies have shown a systematic
and widespread effect of terrorism on public opinion. A rise in anti-immigrant sentiment and Arab- and
Muslim-related prejudices has been registered in European societies independent of whether terrorist attacks took place on local territory like the bombings in Madrid in 2004 (Legewie, 2013; Echebarria-Echabe
and Fernández-Guede, 2006) or far from home countries like the 9/11 events in the United States (Åslund
and Rooth, 2005; Sheridan, 2006; Schüller, 2016) and the targeting of foreign nationals in Bali in 2002
(Legewie, 2013) and in Mumbai in 2008 (Finseraas and Listhaug, 2013). In some of these cases the shift in

4

public opinion has been linked to changes in behavior such as post-9/11 increases in party-defections (from
left-wing membership), political donations and voting (Hersh, 2013) as well as an outright change in the
outcome in parliamentary elections occuring only three days after the Madrid bombings (Montalvo, 2011).
The effect of terrorism on public opinion has been also shown to have adverse economic consequences on
Arab and Muslim minorities, observed in declines in earnings in the U.S. (Kaushal et al., 2007; Dávila
and Mora, 2005) and in employment in the U.S. (Rabby and Rodgers, 2011) and in France (Glover, 2019).
And, in direct relation to our area of analysis, a decline in housing prices and sales in majority Muslim
neighbourhoods has been measured in the aftermath of attacks in Amsterdam (Gautier et al., 2009) and in
London (Ratcliffe and von Hinke, 2015).
But the evidence leaves out a few crucial blind spots. First of all, in so far as research on public opinion
focuses on changes in the immediate aftermath of attacks, it is unclear how the effect reverberates over
time. It has been shown (Hopkins, 2010) that post-attack spikes in anti-immigrant sentiment dissipate
rapidly, within a few months, in line with evidence on the short-term duration of associated psychological
effects like post-traumatic stress disorder (Silver et al., 2002), of behavioral reactions like the substitution
of air travel after the attacks of 9/11 (Gigerenzer, 2006) and of collective emotions and pro-social behavior
following the November 2015 attacks in Paris (Garcia and Rimé, 2019). Second, research tracking effects
in a longer temporal window (i.e., one to three years) like some of the aforementioned studies on economic
outcomes does not rely on perfectly settled evidence. There are also studies which find an effect of terrorism
on attitudes but none on labor market outcomes for Arab-Muslim individuals in the U.S. (Wang, 2018),
Australia (Goel, 2010), Sweden (Åslund and Rooth, 2005) and Germany (Braakmann, 2009) following
the 9/11 attacks and in London following the 2007 bombings there (Braakmann, 2010). Finally, in the
studies that do observe an effect of terrorism, its translation into an increase in discrimination is largely
assumed rather than measured directly, with explicit reference to individual or institutional practices that
disadvantage ethnic minorities.
The Paris Airbnb market under scrutiny in our study provides the means to address these blind spots.
It is a mature market in so far as it represents the largest Airbnb metropolitan economy with more than
seventy thousand unique offerings. Individuals of Arab and/or Muslim origin, who we identify based on
self-reported names on hosts’ Airbnb profiles, make up a sizable population in this market. They are part
of the largest ethnic minority in France (Tribalat, 2015; Beauchemin et al., 2016), many of whom are
second or third generation French citizens and are concentrated in and around the city of Paris (Aubry and
Tribalat, 2011). Given the relatively weak institutionalization and low legal safeguards (Todisco, 2015;
Leong and Belzer, 2017; Calo and Rosenblat, 2017) of the Airbnb market, peer-to-peer exchanges play a
central enough role to assume that any observed differences disadvantaging Arab-Muslim hosts emanate
primarily from interactions between hosts and guests who are mostly private individuals. Armed with panel
data running from November 2014 to March 2018, we are thus able to track peer-to-peer exchanges, to verify
the presence of any discrimination and to observe changes in the immediate aftermath of the large-scale,
deadly terrorist attacks of November 2015 and beyond, up to two and a half years later. In the following
sections we elaborate on how our research design deals with the aforementioned challenges as we present
the data and the methodology and analyze the empirical results.

Data
To examine discrimination on the Airbnb market we analysed monthly panel data on all rentals listed
in the city of Paris between November 2014 and March 2018. The data were purchased from AIRDNA, a
short-term rental data and analytics company. They include exact monthly information on the number of
days a property was listed as available and the number of days it was rented out in a given month along with
the corresponding rental price. The data capture additional descriptive information on listing properties
which is available to customers on the Airbnb website. We restrict the analysis to a sample of hosts whose
names we can identify as uniquely French or Arab/Muslim. We analyze only monthly observations for
which the hosts’ properties were listed as available for rent for at least one day. The resulting dataset
consists of 1,044,022 monthly observations for 72,991 distinct properties over a time period of 41 months.
We categorize variables into the following groups: dependent variables Yi , host characteristics Hi , neighborhood characteristics Ni , time-invariant listing characteristics Li , time variant listing characteristics lit and
reviews rit .
Our two dependent variables are occupancy rate and log price. Occupancy rate is measured by dividing

the number of days a listing was rented out in a given month by the number of days it was listed as available
for rental on the website. A listing on Airbnb has several prices as hosts can set different rates depending
on length of visit. Further, cleaning fees are added to the overall price. Most work done on Airbnb so far
looks at the daily price rate hosts demand (Edelman and Luca, 2014; Laouénan and Rathelot, 2017). Our
data has the advantage that in addition to scraped prices from the Airbnb website we have information on
when and for what price a listing was rented out. This allows us to measure the rate a listing was rented
out for each day it was booked. Taking the average of those daily prices for all days a listing was rented
out in a month gives our price variable. We take the log of the price variable in order to obtain coefficients
that can be interpreted as elasticities. The advantage of this approach is that we exclude properties with
listed prices but no solicited rental and hence measure discrimination on prices actually paid by consumers.
This also avoids having our price data distorted by host strategies, such as setting high daily prices and low
weekly or monthly rates in order to attract more long term rentals, etc. The disadvantage is that listings,
which were not rented out in a given month, are excluded from the sample. In modelling price, we therefore
use a limited sample of 522,991 monthly observations. In order to assure that different results for price
and occupancy rate are not driven by this sample reduction for the price variable, we redo all analysis on
occupancy rates on this smaller sample as a robustness check.
Discrimination, our explanatory variable of interest, is measured via Airbnb host names. We classified
these as distinctly Arab/Muslim or typically French using lists of names applied in two previous studies
(Laouénan and Rathelot, 2017; Behaghel et al., 2015). We complement these lists with publicly available
data on the French government’s opengouv.fr website which is based on work on the etymology of first
names.
As control variables we incorporate all information on the characteristics of the listing that is visible to
a visitor of the Airbnb website with the exception of visual content and written descriptions. Time invariant
listing information includes the number of guests, the number of bedrooms, the number of bathrooms, and
dummy variables for the type of the listing, which can either be a shared room (with another guest or
inhabitant), a private room (in a house or apartment generally inhabited by the host or shared with other
guests) or an entire home/apartment. Time variant listing information includes dummies for whether the
cancellation policy is strict, moderate or flexible, resulting in different possible times and reimbursements
for cancellation; the number of photos listed on the listing site; the minimum stay period specified; if
instantbooking is enabled; if a host has superhost status; and if a listing has business ready status. The
appendix provides detailed descriptions of these certification variables.
Review variables measure the amount and type of reviews a listing has received by former guests up
to the month we observe the listing. They include the number of reviews, the overall rating as well as
the rating for quality of communication, accuracy of descriptions, cleanliness, check-in and location. The
overall rating for a listing is shown on a scale of 0.0 to 5.0 and thus includes 50 possible values. The ratings
on particular items go up to 5 stars, with the possibility of showing half stars, and thus include 10 categories.
We re-scaled all rating variables to go from 0 to 10.
Finally, we create neighbourhood variables to control for the spatial distribution of listings. Using
geocoded information on the listings we divided the city into 81 neighborhood zones which we use as
dummy controls. We further assigned listings to 13 designated tourist zones as published by the Mairie de
Paris (Paris City Hall) on their Open Data website, which overlap with the 81 neighborhood zones. We
included each of these tourist zones as additional dummy control variables for spatial effects. (Fig.3 in the
Appendix displays the 81 Airbnb districts in grey and the 13 tourist zones in blue and Fig.4 and Fig.5 show
the distribution of Arab/Muslim names and prices across the 81 zones.)
Table 1 summarizes descriptive statistics of these variables for the entire panel as well for the January
2015 and January 2018 monthly cross-sections. The latter provide monthly snapshots of data from the
beginning and end of our sample, which are comparable without being affected by monthly seasonality
patterns.
Since Airbnb is a marketplace in which listings can enter and exit we also looked at its evolution
over time. The number of available listings tripled over the 41 months we observed with hosts having
Arab/Muslim names making up 7% of available listings in November 2014 and 9% in March 2018 (see
Fig. 6). There was no notable effect of the November 2015 terrorist attacks on the upward trend in the
number of listings or on the relative share of listings by Arab/Muslim hosts. Throughout the entire observed
time period we also found no substantive differences between the rates of French and Arab/Muslim host
listings exiting the market, which we defined as the last date a listing was actively rented out (see Fig. 7).

Methods
We use three different methodological approaches to measure discrimination against Arab/Muslim
hosts. First, we estimate a random effects panel model predicting log price and occupancy rates using
host and listing characteristics, which gives us an indication of the average price and occupancy rate discount hosts with Arab/Muslim names face, conditional on the characteristics of their listings. Second, we
run repeated OLS regressions, for every month in our sample and look at the monthly coefficients for being
Arab/Muslim hosts which gives us a sense of the evolution of discrimination over time and allows us to
assess the effects of the November 2015 terrorist attacks. Third, we employ fixed effects models, using a
difference in difference strategy to look specifically at how the average strength of discrimination changes
from the time period before to that after the November 2015 attacks.
To assess average levels of discrimination across the entire observed time period we estimate three
nested random effects models. We first look at raw differences between hosts beyond the effect of time
controls, then examine these differences following the inclusion of effects of listing characteristics and
neighbourhoods and, in a third model, of reviews.
Model (1) looks at the raw effect of host name Hi on occupancy rate or log price yit , after controlling
only for a set of monthly time dummies dt :
yit = α + βHi + ηt dt + νit

(1)

Model (2) adds neighborhood spatial controls Ni and controls for time invariant listing characteristics,
Li and time variant ones lit :
yit = α + βHi + γNi + δ1 Li + δ2 lit + ηt dt + νit

(2)

Model (3) adds information on reviews rit :
yit = α + βHi + γNi + δ1 Li + δ2 lit + γrit + ηt dt + νit

(3)

The coefficient β captures how much lower occupancy rates are and by what percentage prices are lower
for hosts with typically Arab/Muslim instead of French names, conditional on the controls included in each
model. We used log price and thus obtain an elasticity for price, but not log occupancy rate, since we have
many values of zero for occupancy rates in our data. A key assumption of the random effects model is that
the individual (listing) level error term is not correlated with the predictors. Under this assumption we can
interpret β as the degree of discrimination a host faces due to his or her ethnicity. The fact that a guest’s
booking decision is made based on the information on the website, which we incorporate in the last two
models, lends credibility to this assumption.
To evaluate if discrimination against Arab/Muslim hosts changed over time we estimate Ordinary Least
Squares (OLS hereafter) regression models for each month t in our panel. The dependent and explanatory
variables remain the same as in the random effects model. The βt now yields the effect of having an
Arab/Muslim name compared to a French name in month t. We use an event study approach, analyzing
the evolution of coefficients, to discern whether discriminatory patterns changed around the date of the
November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris.
Finally we assess the effects of the November 2015 attacks again estimating a listing fixed effects model.
The advantage of this approach is that any time invariant listing characteristics - in particular, the description
of listings, the quality of photos and the neighborhood - will not bias our estimates. However, we cannot
include our variable on whether hosts have Arab/Muslim or French names because this is a time-invariant
characteristic. Instead we use a difference in differences strategy, by looking at the interaction of being a
host with an Arab/Muslim name with observations following the November 2015 attacks:
yit = α + βpat + γA/Mi ∗ pat + δlit + θrit + ηLDi + νit

(4)

We now only include the listing time variant characteristics lit and review variables rit as controls. LDi are
the listing dummies included in the listing fixed effects approach and pa is a post-attacks dummy variable,
which takes the value of 1 for observations after the November 2015 attacks up to March 2018 and the value
of 0 for those prior to November 2015. We exclude observations for November 2015 from the sample. Our
parameter of interest is the coefficient γ for our interaction variable A/M ∗ pa, which estimates whether the
effect on price and occupancy rates of being an Arab/Muslim host changes after the November 2015 attacks.

confidence intervals. Price coefficients are elasticities, occupancy rate coefficients indicate change in percentage levels.
While the listing fixed effects model has the advantage of controlling for unobserved time-invariant
listing characteristics, its disadvantage is that the sample of hosts we estimate these effects on is significantly
smaller and more selective. Only listings which were in the sample before and after the attacks can be
used for estimating γ. Therefore the model does not measure the amount of discrimination faced by newly
entering, less experienced and less certified hosts and the sample is biased towards listings with high survival
times. Assessing the effects of the terrorist attacks via repeated OLS thus assures a more representative
sample representing the entire market, whereas assessing it via a fixed effects model eliminates worries
about any omitted variable bias stemming from non-time varying characteristics.
Using the results from these estimations we proceed to calculate counterfactual revenues for Arab/Muslim
hosts. We increase the observed average daily price and occupancy rate of all Arab/Muslim hosts in our
sample by the percentage reflected in the repeated monthly OLS regression coefficients for having an
Arab/Muslim name. Based on the counterfactual occupancy rate and monthly price we calculate a counterfactual revenue from which we derive the average monthly as well as the cumulative foregone revenue of
all Arab/Muslim hosts. We identify the additional costs resulting from the November 2015 attacks based
on a comparison of the average monthly loss of individual hosts before and after the month of the attacks
and the amount of additional losses resulting from average discrimination being higher after the attacks.
As a robustness check we use estimations from the listing fixed effects models to calculate the additional
revenue loss resulting from stronger discrimination after the terrorist attacks. (see Annex Section C for a
more detailed description)
Since we exclude listings that were not rented out in a given month in the sample used for estimating
price, but not in the sample used for estimating occupancy rate, we checked the robustness of our results by
redoing the occupancy rate analysis on the sample used for price estimations.

Results
The first step in our analysis was to measure the overall level of discrimination against hosts with
typically Arab/Muslim names via random effects panel models. With these measurements at hand, we then
analyzed how discrimination evolved over time, using repeated OLS models and then looked in particular
at changes around the November 2015 Paris terrorist attacks via listing fixed effects models.
The results from the random fixed effects model in Fig.1, show economically meaningful discrimination
based on ethnic/religious characteristics. For reasons of parsimony we display only select control variables
(see Appendix Table 4 for full results). Overall, listings of hosts with Arab/Muslim names have lower price
and occupancy levels. We find for listings of Arab/Muslim hosts a 13% lower price level and a 4.5% lower
occupancy rate. Note that the size of the coefficients is not directly comparable between models for price
and occupancy rate because they measure elasticities (percentage change in price) in the first case and, in
the latter, deviations from the occupancy rate, which has a sample average of 28%, in absolute percentage
terms. We provide an estimate of the relative effect of differences in price and occupancy rates in the section
on costs at the end of the following subsection.
The above raw differences result in part from variations in the quality and location of listings. Following
the introduction of controls for listing characteristics (and reviews), differences in price levels decline to a
disadvantage of 6.0% (5.8% with review controls); for occupancy rates, estimates drop to a disadvantage of
3.6% (3.2%) for hosts with Arab/Muslim names. In sum, we find that hosts with Arab/Muslim names incur
a clear disadvantage in revenue due to both lower prices and lower occupancy rates relative to hosts with
typically French names.

Increases in Discrimination after November 2015 Attacks
Having established the average amount of discrimination, we proceeded to explore whether the strength
of discrimination changed over time, in particular around November 2015 when Paris was struck by a
10

series of coordinated multi-site, lethal terrorist attacks. The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant claimed
responsibility and all immediate perpetrators, mostly French and Belgian citizens, appeared to be of Arab
descent and Muslim confession. The events led to a logical contraction of the Airbnb market. In our data,
the effect is visible in the abrupt and substantial drop in average price and occupancy rates of listings;
price levels took over a year to recover to the pre-attacks levels (left side of Fig. 2). Given the symbolic
associations of the attacks, a rise in discrimination against Airbnb hosts with Arab/Muslim names is an
expected outcome we test for.
The historical trends of price and occupancy rate displayed on the left side of Fig. 2 reveal a substantive
change concomitant with the month of the attacks. Prior to November 2015 there is no visible and statistically significant difference between the occupancy rates of hosts with French or Arab/Muslim names. But
for every month thereafter, listings of Arab/Muslim hosts display lower rates. The effect appears to add
onto differences in price levels. The trend in price rates is visibly sensitive to the attacks but the price gap of
around 20$ between hosts with French and Arab/Muslim names remains stable around November 2015 and
throughout the entire period. The terrorist attacks appear to increase discrimination against Arab/Muslim
hosts by adding a penalty on occupancy beyond and over a pre-existing price gap.
We corroborated the conclusions from the descriptive trends via repeated OLS regressions, modelling
monthly price and occupancy rate separately for each month. The models measure the effect of being
an Arab/Muslim host conditional on listing characteristics. We estimated models with and without listing
reviews; results being broadly similar, we display the coefficients of models without controls for reviews
on the right side of Fig. 2 (see Appendix Fig. 11 - 14 for results without any controls and with review
controls). The graph displays coefficients and confidence intervals showing the effects of being a host with
an Arab/Muslim name relative to a French name on price and occupancy rates in each month. Coefficients
for the models with log(price) as dependent variable show fluctuations in the trend, indicating a decline in
the price gap at the beginning of the time period in the last months of 2014. The overall trend is nonetheless
stable over time with an average price differential in the range of 5-8% at the expense of Arab/Muslim hosts.
The coefficients for the effect of a host having an Arab/Muslim name show no difference in occupancy
rates before the month of the attacks. A persistent and stable gap opens after that point however, with
Arab/Muslim hosts incurring a 2-5% lower occupancy rate.
In an additional test of the effect of the terrorist attacks we estimated models with listing fixed effects,
displayed in table 2 (full results are in Appendix Table 7). The advantage of these models is that all unobserved non-time varying characteristics do not influence our estimates, nor do any differences in listing
characteristics of hosts who enter the market after November 2015. The disadvantage is that we cannot
estimate the overall level of discrimination against Arab/Muslim hosts, since the ethnic/religious affiliation of host names is a time-invariant characteristic. As discussed in the methods section, we do however
model the change in strength of discrimination before and after the attacks. The parameter identifying this
change is calculated on a smaller sample of hosts with higher survival times and better certification. This
is because listings had to be present in the data before and after the attacks to identify the influence of host
characteristics on changes in price and occupancy rates within individual listings. This also means that new
market entrants after the November 2015, and them being potentially treated differently, is not captured by
these models. This notwithstanding, the fixed effects models show a significant drop in occupancy rates
for Arab/Muslim hosts (2.3%) after the attacks, with the effect size being only slightly smaller than in the
repeated OLS models. Additionally, and in contrast to the repeated OLS regressions, the listing fixed effects
approach shows a 1.8% higher price penalty for Arab/Muslim hosts after the terrorist attacks. In spite of
this difference, the two modelling approaches yield a consistent picture of the rise in discrimination against
hosts with Arab/Muslim names following the attacks. Specifically, in our subsequent estimation of monetary losses associated with the rise in discrimination after November 2015, the results from both approaches
arrive at cost estimates in a comparable range and both identify the decline in occupancy rates among
Arab/Muslim listings as the main driver (around two-thirds) of rising costs for hosts with Arab/Muslim
names (see Appendix Table 10).

Calculating Revenue Loss
Based on our results we provide estimates of how much revenue hosts with Arab/Muslim names lost due
to observed differences in price and occupancy rates. These estimates give an intuitive, monetary measure
of the effect of discrimination as well as a unit for comparing the contribution of price and occupancy rate
differences to lowering the revenue of minority hosts. We calculated counterfactual scenarios for the addi11

tional amount of revenue that listings would have received under the assumption that differences in price
and/or occupancy rates for hosts with Arab/Muslim names are null, after controlling for listing characteristics. More precisely, we inferred the potential gains for price and occupancy rates from the coefficients for
having an Arab/Muslim name in repeated monthly OLS regression models with controls for listing characteristics. The sample of analysis includes listings for which there are observations for monthly price - a
necessary condition to estimate counterfactual prices (see Appendix section C for details on the modelling
approach and Appendix Tables 9 and Table 10 for additional results). In Table 3 we report observed average
monthly revenue of Arab/Muslim and French listings along with estimates for average monthly revenue
gains for hosts with Arab/Muslim names under three scenarios of absence of differences: in occupancy
rates only, in price only, and in both. We report results for the entire sample and for the sub-samples of
observations before (11/2014 - 10/2015) and after (12/2015 - 03/2018) the terrorist attacks.
On average the observed revenue of listings of hosts with French names is 1.713 $ US, while that
of hosts with Arab/Muslim names is 1.392 $, resulting in a difference of 321 $. Following controls for
listing characteristics, the difference drops to 208 $ (169 $ with review controls). Differences in price
and occupancy rates contribute almost equal parts to observed differences in revenue between hosts with
French and Arab/Muslim names. Note that the revenue gains under the scenarios modelling counterfactual
occupancy rate and price separately do not add up to the value of the scenario which models them jointly
because a higher occupancy rate yields even greater returns if price is higher and vice versa.
A comparison of the estimates for two sub-samples of observations, one prior and the other following the terrorist attacks of November 2015, illustrates how discrimination changed in size and substance.
For one, we can note that it increased overall as we find an increase in the differences in observed average monthly revenues for French and Arab/Muslim listings. Average monthly revenue for hosts with
Arab/Muslim names declined from 1502 $ before the attacks to 1383 $ after, while it increased from 1603
$ to 1738 $ for those with French names. Similarly, after controlling for listing characteristics we find that
the revenue difference attributable to having Arab/Muslim names increased from 121 $ (106 $ with review
controls) prior to the attacks to 220 $ (178 $) thereafter. Second, discrimination changed in substance. Price
differences accounted almost entirely for estimated revenue losses in Arab/Muslim listings before November 2015. After this month, the effect of differences in occupancy rates overcomes, by a substantial margin,
the contribution of price differences to discrimination against hosts with Arab/Muslim names.
In addition, we provide estimates of the overall market revenue forgone on Arab/Muslim listings. We
estimate that the revenue lost across all hosts of Arab/Muslim listings ranged from 5.5 million $ (model with
review controls) to 6.2 million $ (without review controls). Absent any differences in price and occupancy
rates, this would have corresponded to a 10% increase in the total revenue that Arab/Muslim hosts collected
between November 2014 and March 2018. Absent differences in price only, the result would have been
an additional revenue of 3.5-3.6 million $. Absent differences in occupancy rates only, this number would
have amounted to 2.3-2.9 million $ of additional revenue.

Conclusion
In this study we focused on an emblematic market place of the sharing economy and its sensitivity to
terrorist attacks. Like researchers before us (Edelman et al., 2017; Edelman and Luca, 2014; Laouénan
and Rathelot, 2017), we found evidence of substantive day-to-day discrimination against a traditionally
disadvantaged ethno-religious minority - individuals with Arab/Muslim names advertising properties for
rent on Airbnb’s market in Paris. Already high, the penalties increased following the deadly terrorist attacks
of November 2015. Adding onto a prior price disadvantage, Arab/Muslim hosts incurred a penalty in
occupancy whose rate began declining relative to hosts with typically French names only after the month of
the attacks and lingered for almost two and a half years, up to March 2018 (our last data point).
Notwithstanding the idiosyncrasy of the tragic events of November 2015, the size of the rental market
in Paris renders these findings emblematic of the potential influence of mass terrorism. Large competitive
markets are expected to price out discrimination over time and to recover quicker from exogenous shocks.
Our 41-month long stretch of data on Airbnb’s largest metropolitan market illustrates the limits of market
forces to curb discrimination over time and their susceptibility to the potential of terrorism to amplify prejudices in economic decisions by private individuals. Furthermore, economic theory, under the assumption
that markets adjust to equilibrium instantaneously, would have predicted changes in discriminatory patterns
to be directly observable in price differences. We detected changes in occupancy rates instead. This illustrates the importance of observing a broader range of outcomes to fully capture discriminatory practices. In
this respect, the sharing economy acts as a precious and rich source for real-time data collection to monitor
the substance and evolution of discriminatory practices.
The analysis of discrimination with observational data like ours is subject to omitted variable bias. In
our particular case this may result from missing data on the content of visuals and on written descriptions of
Airbnb properties as well as from any unobserved micro-level neighbourhood differences, each of which,
if correlated with host ethnicity, may bias model estimates. This possibility notwithstanding, our findings
on changes in discrimination after the attacks are less susceptible to omitted variable bias. The repeated
monthly OLS regression models, which yielded the estimates for change in discrimination after November
2015, relied on the assumption that unobserved non-time varying characteristics as well as any differences
in listing characteristics of hosts entering the market following the month of the attacks did not influence
our estimates. The Airbnb market is logically dynamic both with regard to new entries and to the evolution
of individual listings. We therefore complemented the models with a fixed effects approach which relaxed
the above assumption and yielded broadly similar results.
In conclusion, our analysis complemented past findings on the persistence and intensity of day-to-day
discrimination in online peer-to-peer markets and showed evidence on their sensitivity to terrorist attacks.
Neither of these is an exclusive feature of the sharing economy. Evidence of discrimination in the traditional
economy is aplenty (Pager and Shepherd, 2008; Quillian et al., 2017; Adida et al., 2010) and not lacking
with regard to the effects of terrorism (Gautier et al., 2009; Dávila and Mora, 2005; Kaushal et al., 2007;
Glover, 2019; Ratcliffe and von Hinke, 2015). But as the sharing economy and its characteristic reliance on
revealed personal information of buyers and sellers has grown to become an essential feature of contemporary economies, our findings invite further scrutiny on these new markets by researchers and policy makers
willing to understand the specific mechanisms of discrimination and to limit its consequences.

Appendix
A

Supplementary Airbnb Listing Variable Information

Instantbooking means that a listing can be rented out without asking/contacting the host in advance.
Superhost is a status given to hosts by Airbnb if they have an overall rating above 4.8, at least 10 visits
within the last year, or at least 100 nights and 3 visits, 0 cancellations and a response rate of 90% within 24
hours to messages sent to them by guests. Business ready is a certification given to listings, which provide
a given list of amenities ranging from wireless internet and a laptop friendly work-space to such things as
smoke detectors and shampoo, towels and hair dryers. Business ready hosts must also have at least 5 stars
for 60% of their overall, cleanliness and accuracy reviews, propose an entire home for rent and respond to
90% of guest requests within 24 hours.

B

Additional Results and Robustness Checks

First we provide some additional information on our spatial controls. As noted neighborhood variables
are used to control for the spatial distribution of listings. Using geocoded information on the listings we
divided the city into 81 neighborhood zones which we use as dummy controls. We further assigned listings
to 13 designated tourist zones as published by the Mairie de Paris (Paris City Hall) on their Open Data website, which overlap with the 81 neighborhood zones. We included each of these tourist zones as additional
dummy control variables for spatial effects. Fig.3 displays the 81 Airbnb districts in grey and the 13 tourist
zones in blue. Fig.4 shows variation in prices across the 81 neighborhood zones designated by Airbnb,
which we use as neighborhood controls Ni . Fig.5 presents the distribution across the 81 zones of hosts with
Arab/Muslim names. It illustrates their under-representation in the central districts of Paris.
We also provide additional descriptive statistics to better understand the development of the Airbnb
market in Paris. Fig. 6 shows the number of active listings in our sample for each month. There was no
notable effect of the November 2015 terrorist attacks on the upward trend in the number of listings. The
share of listings with hosts having Arab/Muslim names increased over the observed time period from 7%
in November 2014 to 9% in March 2018. Fig. 7 shows the percentage of listings exiting the market. We
defined exit as the last month a listing was available for rental before disappearing from the website without
returning at a later date. We find a drop in exits shortly before the November 2015 attacks, for which
we have no coherent explanation, and an uptick after them. Changes in exits and differences in exit rates
between French and Arab/Muslim host listings yield no consistent story of an effect of the attacks.
Since we displayed price levels in the main text for illustrative purposes, Fig. 8 shows the trend in log
(price) which is the dependent variable we use in our regression models on price.
The monthly revenue of a host is the product of the occupancy rate, the number of days a listing was
available and the average monthly price. We model occupancy rate and price in our paper since they are
the variables most directly linked to discriminatory behavior. Fig. 9 shows the average number of days
listings of Arab/Muslim and French hosts were made available in each month. Three things stand out: 1)
Arab/Muslim hosts consistently make their listings available for more days than French hosts; 2) hosts react
to the November 2015 attacks by making their listings available for more days; 3) the difference between
French and Arab/Muslim hosts in the number of days listed is reduced after the attacks. Fig. 10 shows
trends in monthly revenue. Prior to the attacks Arab/Muslim hosts and French hosts have very similar
monthly revenues, with Arab/Muslim hosts making up for lower prices by having their listings available for
more days. After the attacks a clear gap in revenue emerges.
Table 4 displays estimates of the random effects model, which we used to obtain the Fig. 1. Variables
for the number of reviews and photos were divided by ten for easier display of coefficients. We implemented
the same setup of random effects models using monthly price in US $ (taken in levels instead of logs) and
monthly revenue as dependent variables. The results can be seen in Table 5. We generally do not use
revenue as the dependent variable as it depends on the number of days listings were made available, which
is a variable more dependent on host preferences than consumer discrimination (even though it might also
react to discriminatory patterns). All models show a penalty of at least 8$ on average daily price and a

17

monthly revenue penalty of at least 110$ for male and female hosts with Arab/Muslim names compared
with French male hosts.
Since we exclude listings that were not rented out in a given month in the sample used for estimating
price, but not in the sample used for estimating occupancy rate, we checked the robustness of our results by
redoing the occupancy rate analysis on the sample used for price estimations. Results can be found in Tab.
6. Overall, results are very similar.
We also estimated additional versions of the repeated monthly OLS models. While in the main text
results for log price and occupancy rate, from the models with listing controls and without review controls
are displayed, the monthly raw differences from models without any controls, are found in Fig.11 and
Fig.12. The models including listing and review controls can be seen in Fig.13 and Fig.14. They show
slightly weaker overall discrimination but a similar break in occupancy rates occurring after the November
2015 attacks.
We also estimated repeated OLS models taking revenue as the dependent variable. Fig. 15 shows
results from the model controlling for listing characteristics and Fig. 16 from the model controlling for
listing characteristics and reviews. They confirm that the marked drop in occupancy rates for Arab/Muslim
hosts resulted in significantly lower revenues after the November 2015 attacks.

C

Calculation of Monetary Losses

To assess the monetary consequences of the observed discriminatory patterns we construct counterfactual scenarios. We calculate the additional amount of money Arab/Muslim listings would have made under
the assumption that price differences associated with the ethnic/religious origin of host name do not exist.
Monthly Revenue revlt in month t for listing l is calculated by multiplying the number of days a listing
was available dlt with its occupancy rate olt and the average daily price rate for that month plt : revlt =
plt ∗ olt ∗ dlt .
The first column of Table 3 shows the average monthly revenue as well as the total revenue of all
Arab/Muslim and French listings in our sample. Reported values are for a sample, which excludes monthly
observations of listings that were not rented out in a given month. The reason for this sample selection is
that we cannot calculate a counterfactual price for these listings. This explains the higher average monthly
revenues, compared to those reported in Table 1, which includes revenues of zero for listings that were
available for rental but not rented out.
Total revenue for all our listings l in the 41 months t we observe is calculated as revtot = ∑l,t revlt .
revtot
where #lt is the number of active listings in month t.
Average monthly revenue is defined as revavg = ∑
t #lt
More intuitively expressed, we calculate the average revenue across all monthly sample observations. The
total revenue of all French host listings in our sample between November 2014 and March 2018 was 818
million $ and that of Arab/Muslim hosts was 63 million $. The average monthly revenue of a French host
listing was 1713 $ per month and that of an Arab/Muslim listing 1392 $.
We then proceed to calculate counterfactual revenues for Arab/Muslim hosts. Our first step is to use the
coefficients from the repeated monthly OLS models (2), including controls but no reviews, and (3), including controls and reviews, to calculate counterfactual occupancy rates and prices. Recall that coefficients βt
tell us the effect of being an Arab/Muslim host relative to being a French host on price and occupancy rate
in a given month. We calculate the counterfactual occupancy rate as or˜lt = orlt − βt,or and the counterfactual
price as p˜lt = plt ∗ (1 − βt,p ). The differences in the method of calculation stem from the fact that our price
coefficients capture elasticities whereas those for occupancy rate capture changes in percentage levels. We
use the resulting values to calculate a counterfactual revenue for each month for the Arab/Muslim host population: rev
˜ lt = p˜lt ∗ o˜lt ∗ dlt , where dlt are the number of days the listing was available. To separately assess
the monetary cost resulting from price and occupancy rate differences we also calculate the counterfactual
revenue using only counterfactual price ( p˜lt ∗ olt ∗ dlt ) or only counterfactual occupancy rate (plt ∗ o˜lt ∗ dlt ).
We then proceed to calculate the foregone gains in revenue via revgain = rev
˜ lt − revlt .
Table 1 in the main text shows the average foregone monthly revenue gains of Arab/Muslim hosts
calculated for the entire sample, the sub-sample including only observations prior to the November 2015
attacks and the sub-sample of observations after the attacks. We obtain that revenue would have been
between 169$ (with review controls) and 208$ (without review controls) higher per month if the differences
we measure on occupancy rate and price were absent. The foregone revenue prior to the attacks ranges

18

between 106$ (with review controls) and 121$ (no review controls) and is much lower than that after the
attacks, which ranges between 178$ (with review controls) and 220$ (no review controls).
Differences in revenue between French and Arab/Muslim hosts are the result of three sets of factors: 1)
the better quality of listings of French hosts which in turn have higher predicted price and occupancy rate on
average; 2) the higher number of days listings of Arab/Muslim hosts are listed as available compared to those
of French hosts which leads to higher revenue for Arab/Muslim hosts; and 3) the price and occupancy rate
difference between Arab/Muslim and French hosts after controlling for listing characteristics (and reviews)
which we interpret as a consequence of discrimination. Table 1 in the main text reports the average revenue
differences and how much they would have changed if we were to correct for discrimination. In order
to account for differences in the number of days listings were made available, we report Table 9 average
revenue similar to that in Table 1 in the main text but here reported values are per day listed rather than per
month. Note that monthly revenue net of discrimination is similar for Arab/Muslim hosts and French hosts
prior to the attacks but there remain significant differences in revenue per listing day. This is due to the
higher number of days Arab/Muslim hosts made listings available. In addition to revenue differences per
day listed, Table 9 also includes the total of lost revenue summed over all listings and over all 41 months of
observations. It ranges between 7.7 million $ (review controls) and 9.5 million $ (no review controls).
Finally Table 10 presents results from two alternative approaches we use to measure the cost of additional discrimination associated with the November 2015 terrorist attacks. In the first approach, instead of
estimating repeated OLS regression models on a monthly basis, we estimate one OLS regression in which
we compare the level of discrimination in every month after November 2015 to the average level of discrimination that we observe over the entire period before November 2015. For the purpose, we exclude
observations from November 2015, use the period prior to the attacks as our reference period and include
p
monthly dummy variables mt for all months after the attacks. We also control for the host having an
Arab/Muslim name with Hi and then interact hosts having an Arab/Muslim name with the set of monthly
dummies for months after the attacks:
p

p

p

yit = α + βHi + βt Hi ∗ mt + γNi + δ1 Li + δ2 γlit + ζrit + ηt dt + νit
p

(5)

The coefficients βt illustrate how much stronger differences in price or in occupancy rate associated
with the host having an Arab/Muslim name were in each month t after the attacks compared to the average
p
effect of having an Arab/Muslim name prior to the attacks. We use the βt coefficients from the models to
calculate foregone revenue for Arab/Muslim hosts in the sub-sample of observations for the period between
December 2015 and March 2018. The results illustrate how much additional revenue was foregone due to
the higher post-attacks penalty for being an Arab/Muslim host. It ranges from 85$ (controls with reviews)
to 110$ (controls without reviews) per month per Arab/Muslim listing. This corresponds to a total revenue
loss of 3.4 million $ (controls with reviews) or 4.4 million $ (controls without reviews). Almost the entirety
of this additional loss is explained by the increase in occupancy rate differences between Arab/Muslim and
French listings.
In the second modelling approach, we calculate the effect of the terrorist attacks on revenue using the
estimates from the fixed effects models. As a caveat, recall that in the fixed effects models we estimate
the coefficients for changes in discriminatory patterns on a sub-sample of listings for which there are observations prior to and after the terrorist attacks. The advantage of this estimation is that estimates are not
affected by unobserved time-invariant listing characteristics. Here we make use of the models’ γ coefficients
which are estimates of the interaction variable A/M ∗ PostAttacks, in other words, they capture the increase
in discrimination following the month of the attacks. We use them to calculate counterfactual revenues
for Arab/Muslim listings after November 2015. The associated coefficients are reported in Table 7. The
values for revenue loss are similar to those obtained by the calculation with coefficients from the repeated
OLS regression models. Monthly revenue lost due to stronger discrimination after the attacks is 89.24 $
per listing per month (with controls and no reviews) or 104.73$ (with controls and reviews). The total sum
of all revenue lost in that period is estimated at 3.6 million $ (with controls and no reviews) or 4.2 million
$ (with controls and reviews). The amount of overall foregone revenue due to the attacks is comparable
between the repeated OLS models and the fixed effects models. However, in the results from the repeated
OLS models the entire additional revenue loss results from changes in occupancy rates, whereas in the fixed
effects approach about 3/4 of the additional revenue loss is due to changes in occupancy rate and 1/4 is due
to changes in price.
