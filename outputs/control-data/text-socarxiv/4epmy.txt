Practices of Corporate Integrity and Accountability of Non-Profit Organizations in
Malaysia
Abstract
Purpose - This paper aims to examine the five dimensions of Corporate Integrity Systems
and their effects on accountability outcomes of Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs).
Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 550 survey conducted among NPOs in
Malaysia registered under Registrar of Society. Regression analysis was conducted to examine the
relationships between five dimensions corporate integrity systems and accountability outcomes.
Findings - The findings revealed that all five dimensions of corporate integrity systems

(compliance, policies and rules, organizational culture, leadership, ethics training and
education, and whistle-blowing) significantly contribute to positive accountability outcomes
of NPOs.
Practical implications - In order for NPOs to deliver greater accountability outcomes to their
stakeholders, serious emphasis on corporate integrity systems is vital.
Originality/value – To the best of the authors‟ knowledge, this study is among the first empirical
study to examine the role of corporate integrity system dimensions and accountability outcomes in the
case of NPOs in Malaysia.

1. Introduction
The changing political and economic environment around the globe has resulted in an
increasing concern for fraud activities. Fraud does not only involve moral issues, but it is also
a barrier to a nation‟s prosperity by undermining good governance, distorting public policies,
leading to misallocation of resources, and hurting the economic growth (Bardhan, 1997;
Rose-Ackerman, 1999; Said et al., 2015; 2016a,b,c).
To reduce fraud cases, the accountability issues of Non-Profit Organizations (NPOs)
have been raised over the past decade, where the NPOs are strongly considered to put
corporate integrity systems in place to promote accountability outcomes (Doig, 2013; Jones
& Thompson, 2012; Doig & Norris, 2012; Said & Omar, 2014). The APG Typologies Report
in 2011 discusses the reason why corporate integrity is important within NPOs. First, NPOs
enjoy the public trust. Second, they have access to sources of funds which are cash-intensive.
Third, NPOs have a global presence. They provide a framework for local and international
operations and financial transactions, which expose them to terrorist activities. For example,
poor and needy areas are usually a base for terrorists, such as in Somalia, where it is hard to
distinguish legitimate and illegitimate organizations. Fourth, NPOs are exposed to a large
number of beneficiaries. Finally, the reason that mitigates the threats of integrity to NPOs
should be prioritized since the NPOs are not subjected to government oversight. Further, a
lack of accountability, such as high executive salaries and misused funds, has consequences
and implications to NPOs due to the lost of trust on the part of donors. The implementation of
corporate integrity systems is crucial to regain public trust in NPOs.
Edwards and Hulme (1995) noted that accountability is an essential NPO practice in
relation to enhancing legitimacy. The survival of NPOs in retaining their mission has always
been argued (Irvine, 2005). Major financial scandals have been highlighted in the United
2

States, such as the embezzlement by the president of the United Way of America (Murawski,
1995), the investment fraud in the Foundation for the New Era Philanthropy (Stecklow,
1997), theft by leaders of the Episcopal and Baptist churches (Greene, 1995), and the
excessively generous compensation package for the president of the Adelphi University
(Thornburg, 1997) that have hurt the credibility of the NPOs.
Accountability could avert fraud and abuse of power (Graycar, 2012; Lamboo, 2010;
Malagueno et al., 2010), but commitment from the government is needed for accountability
mechanisms that encourage ethical practices and ensure the implementation of proper
processes including detailed documentation and openness to scrutiny (Mcgee & Gaventa,
2011; Keohane, 2005; Velayutham & Perera, 2004). Currently, organizations including NPOs
are subjected to increasing pressure to be more accountable (Heaton, Savage, & Welch, 1993;
Hacker & Garst, 2000; Pallot, 2001) due to the increasing cases of fraud and
mismanagement. According to Guthrie (1994), various measures have been outlined to
promote accountability at the organizational level. In context of NPOs, accountability is
about ensuring that the public trust is served (Ebrahim, 2003).
Research on factors contributing to accountability has been extensively studied, but
these studies tend to focus on the efficiency of the management (Hui et al., 2011), budgeting
(Goddard, 2004), politics (Barton, 2006), and innovations (Christensen & Skaerbaek, 2007).
There are five forms of accountability in the public sector organizations that were found in
Australia namely political, public, managerial, professional, and personal, together with two
discourses, which are structural and personal (Sinclair, 1995). The Nordic countries share
even more similar values and principles, such as democracy, openness, service, and
efficiency for accountability in public sectors (Corte-Real, 2008; Pekkarinen et al., 2011;
Salminen & Ikola-Norrbacka, 2010). The British tradition presumes that their civil servants
are loyal to ministers; they must be neutral and the relationship between the minister and civil
servants should be based on trust (Joannides, 2012; Salminen & Ikola-Norrbacka, 2010).
From the context of the Finnish public administration, three core-ethical issues namely trust,
good governance, and unethical actions were examined by Kalsi et al. (2009), and Plumptre
and Graham (1999).
However, there is a huge lack of empirical studies conducted to examine factors
contributing to accountability outcomes in the context of NPOs. Therefore, this study aims to
determine and explore the factors that promote accountability in the public sector
organizations. This study discusses the relationship of five elements of the corporate integrity
system (Compliance, Policies and Rules, Organizational Culture, Leadership, Ethics Training
and Education, and Whistle-blowing) in enhancing accountability in the NPOs in the context
of Malaysia.
There are strong justifications to conduct the study in Malaysia. Malaysia is an
emerging economy that is targeted to achieve vision 2020 to become a developed nation by
the year 2020. Therefore, the government of Malaysia is serious about combating fraud by
promoting the Corporate Integrity System (CIS). Corporate Integrity System is an ethical
guideline that provides companies with a blueprint for risk assessment, areas of improvement,
and a general indicator of organizational integrity. It is a tool for helping organizations to
assess and measure their progress in making a formal and transparent commitment to ethics
and integrity in the workplace (Said & Omar, 2014; Said et al. 2016b). In 2004, the National
Integrity Plan (NIP) was formed by the Malaysian Institute of Integrity (IIM) under the 5th
Prime Minister, Tun Abdullah Ahmad Badawi‟s direction. The main goal of the NIP

3

formation is to meet the fourth challenge of Vision 2020, which is to “establish a fully moral
and ethical society whose citizens are strong in religious and spiritual values and imbued with
the highest ethical standards”. NIP not only seeks to embed integrity in the private sector, but
also in political parties, non-government organizations, religious groups, the media, and
women, youth and student groups.
Various initiatives and strategies have been undertaken and implemented in fighting
corruption, but yet the corruption level in Malaysia remains high. In 2013, the Asia-Pacific
Fraud Survey (Ernst and Young, 2013) reported that Malaysia and China had the highest
levels of bribery and corruption. The average percentage of this survey was 21 but 39 percent
of the respondents claimed that corruption and bribery were practised widely in Malaysia,
which is almost twice the average percentage. To make things worse, Malaysia was the third
highest with 29 percent respondents claiming that the corruption and bribery practices in
Malaysia would continue to increase, especially in a tough economic environment with tight
competition. These results are supported by the Transparency International Corruption
Perception Index 2013, which covers 177 countries worldwide (Ernst and Young, 2014).
They measured the perceived level of public sector corruption with a score ranging from 0
(highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean and transparent). The results show that 69 percent of the
countries have a score of below 50, which indicates that these countries are having serious
corruption problems. Even though Malaysia did not fall under the 69 percent, the worrying
situation is that the score for Malaysia in this survey was 50 over 100, which means a
borderline level of transparency. Therefore, this study on Malaysia will be highly beneficial
for policy makers and related public and private agencies.
2. Literature Review and Hypotheses Development
2.1 Compliance, Policies and Rules, and Accountability Outcomes
Compliance to policies and rules benefit an organization by preventing the incidence of bad
financing as well as helping it to work effectively and in harmony while detecting errors and
irregularities in its operation (Pathak, 2005; Wardiwiyono, 2012). Organizations also
recognize the importance of compliance, policies, and rules, which have been viewed as
useful tools in safeguarding the organization‟s assets and reputation (Aziz, 2013). Bowrin
(2004) argued that compliance to policies and rules promote transparency, accountability,
responsibility, and fairness to all stakeholders. In the case of NPOs, compliance to policies
and rules supports in establishing the system, while fostering the decision maker‟s
accountability (Bianchi, 2010). In contrast, failure to comply with policies and rules could
harm the organization in many ways while exposing the risk to the efforts of nurturing
accountability. Higher compliance is constantly associated with higher expectation in
enhancing the accountability in the organization (Liu, 2011). Therefore, this study considers
the following hypothesis.
H1: There is a positive relationship between compliance, policies and rules, and
accountability outcomes
2.2 Organizational Integrity Culture and Accountability Outcomes
Organizational integrity culture promotes ethical conduct in the context of the organization‟s
mission, vision, structure, and strategy. In order to protect public resources and to enhance
accountability outcomes, the culture of integrity is argued to be able to strengthen
organizational ethics, transparency, and professionalism (Said & Omar, 2014; Said et al.,
2016a,b,c; Barney, 1986). In contrast, failure to inculcate an ethical culture will provide

4

opportunities for mismanagement, misuse of power, and conflict of interest (Karim, Said, &
Bakri, 2015). Past studies report that some corporate executives are willing to increase profits
by engaging in unethical practices (Connor, 2007; Kochan, 2006; Shaxson, 2007). Such
practices seem to be part of an “enterprise culture” that persuades many to believe that
“bending the rules” for personal gain is a sign of business acumen (Rosli et al., 2015). This in
turn will contribute negatively to accountability outcomes of the organization. Therefore, this
study considers the following hypothesis.
H2: There is a positive relationship between organizational integrity culture and
accountability outcomes
2.3 Integrity Leadership and Accountability Outcomes
According to Mintrop and Trujillo (2007), leadership may relate to more positive or negative
organizational accountability outcomes. Meanwhile, Demers and Wayland (1982) as well as
Davis (1973, 1976) regard leaders in an organization as accountable for both achieving
economic goals and behaving in a socially responsible manner. Schein (1985) mentions that
organizational integrity centrally hinges on the agency of leaders whose role are to embody
organizational and personal commitments and integrate the core values of the organization
with its needs to solve problems of adaptation to its environment. The path-goal theory of
leadership (House, 1971; House & Dessler, 1974; House & Mitchell, 1974) highlights the
contextual variables relevant for motivation and the impact of leaders‟ behavior on
subordinates‟ performance and satisfaction. House and Mitchell (1974) suggest that some
variables (e.g., subordinate characteristics, task, and environmental characteristics) are the
drivers of the most appropriate leadership style for the highest staff performance and
satisfaction. This theory is based on the expectancy theory (Vroom, 1964) and it assumes that
subordinates are motivated to act based on perceived expected outcomes and how important
each expected outcome is to them. The path-goal theory provides a framework for the leader
to influence and motivate others to achieve the organization‟s mission. Therefore, this study
considers the following hypothesis.
H3: There is a positive relationship between integrity of leaders and accountability
outcomes
2.4 Ethical Training and Education and Accountability Outcomes
Ethical training must become part of the organization‟s integral process to ensure higher
accountability outcomes (Bruce, 1994; Brumback, 1991; Burke & Black, 1990; Menzel,
1995). Ethical training and education will increase the willingness of workers to act in ways
that demonstrate a higher level of integrity, resulting in increased accountability (Feldheim &
Wang, 2002). Feldheim and Wang (2002) posited that ethical training would increase the
willingness of workers to act in ways that demonstrate accountability and thus should result
in increased accountability. Accordingly, the following hypothesis is proposed.
H4: There is a positive relationship between ethical training and education and
accountability outcomes
2.5 Whistle-blowing and Accountability Outcomes
Dozier and Miceli (1995) and Miceli and Near (1992) report that organizational
responsiveness is positively associated with whistle-blowing. The existence of whistleblowing policies is positively related to employees' perception that their organization
encourages whistle-blowing (Keenan, 1990; Blenkinsopp & Snowden, 2016). Whistle-

5

blowing explores how the organization encourages individuals (both internal and external to
the entity) to speak up and make reports of questionable conduct, which subsequently
promotes accountability (Said & Omar, 2014). Clarke (1999) adds that employees have more
motivation to report fraud in the organization with the existence of the whistle-blowing
policy. This subsequently provides an indication that the organization is serious in promoting
accountability. Therefore, this study considers the following hypothesis.
H5: There is a positive relationship between whistle-blowing and accountability
outcomes
3. Methodology
3.1 Sampling and Data Collection
Data for the study were collected based on a random survey from the NPOs located in
Selangor, Negeri Sembilan, and Kuala Lumpur. The survey questionnaire was sent through
email to 550 individuals involved in NPOs related to culture and recreation, health, social
services, politics, and environmental sectors. In total, 111 sets of questionnaires were
collected from the respondents after follow-up emails and personal approaches. Out of 111
respondents, 63 respondents are from Selangor NPOs, 32 respondents from Kuala Lumpur
NPOs, and 16 respondents from Negeri Sembilan NPOs.
3.2 Determinants of Variables
Regarding legal compliance, policies, and rules, the respondents were asked about the core
laws, policies, rules, and guidance that comprise the legal framework for the organization‟s
ethics and integrity system. This category assesses the internal framework that provides the
grounds for ethical behavior. It also includes compliance with the external legal framework,
established by multiple jurisdictions and legal frameworks within which the organization
operates.
In terms of organizational culture, the respondents were asked about the degree to
which an organization focuses on shaping its organizational culture (both the written and
unwritten rules that dictate how work is performed and goals are reached) and whether that
culture actively promotes an ethical conduct.
The respondents were asked about leadership that covers the responsibilities of the
organization‟s leadership in shaping, guiding, and supporting the organization‟s ethics and
integrity initiatives. It examines how leaders and managers are held accountable for
promoting ethics and integrity. This category includes an assessment of the organization‟s
“Tone from the Top” at both the senior executive and governance levels.
In the case of ethical training and education, the respondents were asked about ethics
and integrity awareness, skill-building training and education, and the integration of such
training into the overall development of all employees. This category includes the provision
of ethics-related training and skill building throughout the life cycle of staff members, and the
degree to which these initiatives are integrated into other organization-wide training
commitments.
The respondents were asked about the whistle-blowing policy that explores how the
organization encourages individuals (both internal and external to the entity) to speak up and
make reports of questionable conduct. This category explores the methods and protection

6

offered to individuals who wish to make the organization aware of possible unethical
behavior, misconduct, or illegal actions. It includes the making of both confidential and
anonymous reports, and the systems used by the organizations to protect whistle-blowers
from retaliation or retribution.
Finally, the respondents were asked about the level of accountability of NPOs that
examines how funds are authorized and used. Items asked include the extent to which their
organizations prepare and submit financial reports annually, report serious incidences, which
may have a negative impact on the public to a higher authority, have a regular reporting
system on the achievements and results of the programs or projects against their objectives,
having performance measures concerning the quality of services delivered, provide
complaints and redress mechanisms, and openly receive monitoring visits from funding and
oversight agencies.
3.3 Model and Statistical Test
The data are analyzed using descriptive statistics, factor analysis, and cross-sectional
regression. Initially, validity of the data is tested through several standard diagnostic
procedures – the adequacy of data is tested by Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test; the normality of data
is tested by skewness and kurtosis analysis; and the homoscedasticity of data is tested by Ftest and Bartlett Sphericity test. Than a correlation analysis is carried out to check the
multicollinearity problem. Finally, the reliability of the data is tested by using the Cronbach‟s
alpha test.
4. Results and Findings
4.1 Demographic Information
The total number of respondents include 55 males (49.5 percent) and 56 females (50 percent),
which shows that there is an equal distribution of male and female respondents in this study
(Table 1). Among the respondents, there are 65 (58.6 percent) Malays, 28 (25.2 percent)
Chinese, and 18 (16.2 percent) Indians. In terms of age, most of the respondents are between
25-34 years old (35.1 percent), followed by 35 to 45 years old (29.7 percent). In the category
for educational qualifications, 43.2 percent of the respondents are degree holders, followed
by 25.2 percent of diploma holders.

The respondents are also evenly distributed for each category in terms of job
designation consisting of 35 (31.6 percent) respondents from the top management, 38 (34.2
percent) respondents from the mid-level management, and another 38 from the low-level
management. This study defines top management as individuals who have the highest rank in
the organizations and focus on long-term strategic planning such as the board, president, and
vice president. Meanwhile, the one who is directly involved in managing and operating the
organization such as managers and executives are considered the middle management. The
low-level management comprises supporting staff, consisting of mostly volunteers and parttimers.
4.2 Factor Analysis
By using the varimax rotations, an exploratory factor analysis is performed to understand the
correlations structure of each variable and sampling adequacy. The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
coefficient for these dataset is .817 for compliance, policies, and rules, .810 for organizational
culture, .798 for leadership, .892 for ethical training and education, .736 for whistle-blowing,
and .834 for accountability, indicating that the data could be used to proceed with the
exploratory factor analysis (Hair et al., 2010).
In addition, to test the homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variances, the Bartlett
Sphericity test is conducted where the value for compliance, policies, and rules (Chisquare=259.070, df=21, p<.000), organization culture (Chi-square=220.465, df=21, p<.000),
leadership (Chi-square=326.027, df=21, p<.000), ethical training and education (Chisquare=522.172, df=21, p<.000), whistle-blowing (Chi-square=271.650, df=21, p<.000), and
accountability (Chi-square=569.493, df=78, p<.000) are noted to be statistically significant.
4.3 Correlation Analysis
Correlation examines the relationship between two variables in a linear fashion (Coakes et
al., 2008). This analysis helps to identify whether one variable is related to another. Prior to
testing the model, the correlation analysis is performed to examine the relationship between
compliance, policies and rules, organization culture, leadership, ethical training, and
education as well as whistle-blowing with the accountability of NPOs in Malaysia. For this
study, a Pearson Correlation test is used to ascertain whether there are any multicollinearity
problems occurring among the variables. The two variables are considered highly correlated
to each other and explain the dependent variable, which will cause a multicollinearity
problem if the values of coefficient is 0.8 or 0.9, and above (Field, 2000).
Table 2 shows the summary of the results when the bivariate analysis is done to test
the correlation between one variable to another. The statistical results show that the
correlation values among the variables range between 0.066 and 0.664. This indicates that
there is no multicollinearity problem among the variables since none of the correlation is
more than 0.8. Accountability (Acc) is significant with Compliance, Policies and Rules
(CPR), Organizational Culture (OrgC), Leadership (Lead), Ethical Training and Education
(ETEd), and Whistle Blowing (WB). In addition, CPR is significant with OrgC, Lead, ETEd,
and WB. On the other hand, OrgC is significant with CPR, Lead, ETEd, and WB.
Meanwhile, Lead is significant with CPR, OrgC, ETEd, and WB. However, ETEd and WB
are not significant to each other. In terms of the correlation between the dimension of
corporate integrity systems and accountability, the results indicate that there is a significant
relationship among compliance, policies and rule, organization culture, leadership, ethical
training, education, and whistle blowing towards accountability.

4.4 Regression Analysis
Table 3 shows the regressions output to inquire if the integrity dimensions are significantly
associated with the level of accountability outcomes of NPOs in Malaysia. Based on the
result, the regression stands statistically at a 1% (F = 37.96, p = 0.000) level that also
indicates the homoscedasticity or homogeneity of variances. The R2 value indicates that
about 64.4 percent of the accountability factors can be explained by this model.

The significant positive relationship between the organization‟s compliance, policies,
and rules and accountability of NPOs in Malaysia highlights that a high level of
organizational policies may lead to a high accountability level in the NPOs. This is consistent
with the studies conducted by Suchman (1995), Meyer and Rowan (1977), and Othman and
Ali (2012) where they found that a company‟s rules and policies are related to the
accountability level of the organization. Therefore, the hypothesis that there is a positive
relationship between organizational policy and accountability in Malaysia (H1) is supported.
Moreover, the result for organizational culture towards accountability is positively
significant; hence, this study supports H2. The significant positive relationship between
NPOs‟ organizational culture and their accountability indicates that the culture in the
organization includes the workers; the ethical work environment culture significantly
contributes to accountability outcomes in the context of NPOs. This is supported by previous
studies (Martin & Nakayama, 2007; Martin & David, 2006; Ladmanova, 2003).
However, this study found no statistically significant relationship between leadership
of NPOs and their accountability, which explains that leadership has no relation with the

9

NPOs‟ accountability in Malaysia. This result is not consistent with a previous study by
Mintrop and Trujillo (2007a), where they found leadership could relate to the accountability
system positively or negatively. It is also inconsistent with the results found by Demers and
Wayland (1982) as well as Davis (1973, 1976). Therefore, the hypothesis that there is a
positive relationship between leadership in the NPOs and their accountability (H3) is not
supported.
Further, the findings of this study found that there is a significant relationship between
ethical training and education and accountability outcomes of NPOs in Malaysia. Hence,
hypothesis 4 (H4) is supported since there is a positive relationship between ethical training
provided to the employees in the NPOs and their accountability. This is consistent with
studies conducted by Feldheim and Wang (2002), Bruce (1994), Brumback (1991), Burke
and Black (1990), and Menzel (1995), where all these researchers agreed that ethical
education and enforcement might lead to the increase of accountability.
Finally, the study found a significant positive relationship between the whistleblowing policy and the NPOs‟ accountability in Malaysia. This is also consistent with
previous studies done by Dozier and Miceli (1985) as well as Miceli and Near (1992), where
they believed that whistle-blowing could affect the accountability of an organization.
Therefore, the hypothesis that there is a positive relationship between whistle-blowing and
NPOs‟ accountability is supported and the existence of reporting policies such as whistleblowing may affect the perception.
4.5 Diagnostic Test
In order to ensure the data is normally distributed, the study examines the skewness and
kurtosis of the data. According to Tabachnick and Fidell (2001), the data is considered
normal if the value of skewness and kurtosis is between -2 to +2. Based on Table 4, the
skewness for all variables show a normal distribution as all the values are between -2 to +2.
In addition, the kurtosis of the data for all variables show that the data distribution is normal.

Reliability Analysis looks at the internal consistency and stability of the measuring
instrument. Cronbach‟s alpha coefficient is commonly used as the internal consistency
indicator. The ideal value of Cronbach‟s alpha coefficient differs among the studies.
Nunnally (1978, p.226) suggests a modest reliability ranging between 0.5 and 0.6 would
suffice for an initial study. Loewenthal (2004) mentions the value of 0.6 could be acceptable.
Hair et al. (2010) mention that the generally agreed lower limit for Cronbach‟s alpha may
decrease to 0.60 in exploratory research. Pallant (2007) mentions it should be above 0.700.
The results of Cronbach‟s Alpha for the five independent variables in this study range from
0.796 to 0.918, which means all the statements are reliable as the scores exceed 0.70 (Table

10

4). Furthermore, Accountability had a Cronbach‟s alpha reliability coefficient score of 0.874;
this indicates that the internal consistency for reliability for all five (5) items in the
questionnaire is excellent and reliable.
5. Discussion and Conclusion
This study investigated the five dimensions of the corporate integrity system and their
relationship with NPOs‟ accountability. The five dimensions of integrity considered for this
study are organizational policies and rules, organization‟s ethical culture, leadership in the
organization, ethical education and training, and the practice of whistle-blowing. Among all
the five dimensions, the most important dimension is ethical culture. It was found that the
NPOs in Malaysia consider the culture and work environment important in delivering higher
accountability outcomes by the NPOs. Thus, Malaysian NPOs should place high emphasis on
organizational ethical culture to avoid unethical practices. This is relevant as cultural values
may guide people‟s behavior (Booysen, 1999, 2000; Hofstede, 1980a, b, 1991, 1998; House
& Aditya 1997; House et. al., 1999) including accountability. Culture may also define a
particular identity.
The second hypothesis was that there is a significant relationship between
organizational culture and NPOs‟ accountability in Malaysia. The result shows that there is a
significant relative relationship between organizational culture and NPOs‟ accountability in
Malaysia. This significant positive relationship indicates that the work culture and
environment may increase the ability to work together (Fukuyama, 1995). The trust culture
may also mitigate the complexity of a non-profit culture (Martin & David, 2006; Ladmanova,
2003) such as the lack of trust.
In addition, the study also hypothesized that there is a positive relationship between
leadership and NPOs‟ accountability. The result from this study indicated that there is an
insignificant relationship between leadership and accountability. This means that good
leadership does not ensure good accountability by the NPOs. Leadership is a key success
factor of an organization, but it does not ensure that the organization will have a high level of
accountability. It depends on how the leader leads, and it is mostly up to the organization‟s
manager to try and encourage accountability. The result was therefore found to be
inconsistent with the study conducted by Mintrop and Trujillo (2007a) where it was found
that ethical leaders play a major role in shaping the employees morale and action with
accountability, both positively and negatively.
The fourth dimension of integrity, which is ethical training and education, was also
examined towards the accountability of NPOs in Malaysia. It was hypothesized that there is a
significant positive relationship between ethical education and NPOs‟ accountability in
Malaysia. The results show that ethical education and training has a significant effect towards
accountability. This is supported by Bruce (1994), Brumback (1991), Burke and Black (1990)
as well as Menzel (1995), where all of them agreed that ethics is important in the
management process and it will influence the workers to be accountable while carrying out
their responsibilities, resulting in high accountability (Feldheim & Wang, 2002). Ethical
education will train the employees in the NPOs of the importance of accountability in their
daily routine. Ethics is closely related to behavior and feeling accountable for one‟s actions.
Lastly, the objective of integrity was examined by looking at the relationship between
the fifth dimension, which is whistle-blowing and Malaysian NPOs‟ accountability. It was

11

hypothesized that there is a significant relationship between whistle-blowing and the
accountability of NPOs in Malaysia. The results from the study are found to be consistent
with Blackburn‟s (1988) findings where it was reported that an entity would respond
effectively with the existence of reporting policies (Keenan, 1990). This is because the NPOs
are mission-based, and closely related to the public‟s perception. In fact, whether the
employee blows the whistle or not, ethical issues may still arise. Some organization may view
the whistle blower as a betrayer of the organization because whistle blowing represents a
conflict between the employee‟s loyalty to the organization and an employee‟s legal
obligations to report apparently fraudulent activities to the proper authorities (Clarke, 1999).
On the other hand, some may view the person who blows the whistle as a heroic defender
(Rothschild & Miethe, 1999). In case of NPO, if the employee just stay silent while knowing
something not right is actually happening within the organization, he/she may be unethical to
the society. Therefore, NPOs should encourage whistle-blowing practice and embed it in the
organizational culture.
Finally, in order to portray higher accountable outcomes, it is crucial for NPOs to
seriously implement all of the factors of corporate integrity systems. Especially Malaysian
NPOs should implement corporate integrity systems that introduced by Malaysian Institute of
Integrity.
