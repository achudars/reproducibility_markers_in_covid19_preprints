Land Tenure and Missing Women: Evidence from
North India

Current version: November 25, 2020

While a substantial literature documents a robust positive relationship between property
rights and economic growth, the effects of institutions on demographic and socio- political outcomes are less well understood. This paper studies this relationship by using variation in property rights systems induced by historically contingent assignment of districts
in North Indian state of Uttar Pradesh to study their effects on modern day demographic
outcomes. We find that villages where property rights were granted to the cultivators have
more skewed sex-ratios, lower female literacy, and lower female labor force participation
rate than villages where property rights were granted to the landlord. These findings suggest that, in contrast to the robust positive relationship between institutions and economic
outcomes, economic institutions may, depending on existing social norms, ameliorate or
exacerbate social inequalities.

1 Introduction
A stark demographic imbalance exists in the two largest countries in the world: men outnumber women by 70 million in China and India. The political, economic, and social
implications of this are vast and are beginning to surface in both countries in a variety of
economic and social channels: a distorted labor market, an excessively high savings rate,
property value inflation, and increases in violent crime, trafficking, and prostitution. In
India, women’s outcomes are systematically worse in a variety of measures, including literacy, labor force participation, and education attainment, and there has recently been a
disturbing increase in violence against women (Jayachandran 2015). Son preference manifests in a variety of health disparities between men and women, which result in starkly
different mortality in later-life (Anderson and Ray 2010) and is a leading explanation for
the alarmingly high levels of stunting among children in India (Jayachandran and Pande
2017). The broad consensus on the causes is “A combination of cultural preferences, government decree, and modern medical technology” (Denyer and Gowen 2018). To address
the likely causes of these problems, it is imperative that we first understand the likely
causes of the underlying demographic disparity.
This paper explores the institutional roots of the demographic imbalance in North India, and argues that property rights play an important role in the ‘missing women’ problem. In doing so, it extends the study of the effects of economic institutions such as property rights, whose strong positive effects on economic outcomes and growth is well documented (North and Weingast 1989; Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson 2001; Sokoloff and
Engerman 2000), to social outcomes. In contrast, we find that the effects of property rights
on social outcomes such as the sex ratio in our setting negative and find evidence that they
may exacerbate existing socio-political inequalities (Brulé 2018; Bhalotra, Brulé, and Roy

2

2018; Kulkarni 2017). In particular, we find that outcomes for women (sex-ratio, female
literacy, and labor force participation) are worse in areas where farmers, as opposed to
absent landlords, were granted property rights. Biased sex ratios have been linked with
conservative views on gender roles (Grosjean and Khattar 2019) and therefore can be expected to exacerbate gender inequality.
To credibly identify the effects of land-tenure institutions on demographic outcomes,
we use variation in historical land-tenure institutions produced by the gradual British conquest of India. In particular, we exploit the variation in land-tenure introduced in villages
in the state of Uttar Pradesh by the staggered conquest of the erstwhile Awadh principality, previously a satellite state of the Mughal Empire, between 1805 and 1860. Half the
districts in the principality were incorporated into the North-western provinces in 1801 as
part of a treaty effectively imposed by the East India Company (EIC) upon the new nawab
(king) of Awadh, Sa’adat Ali Khan, whom the EIC installed following a period of court
intrigue over succession. The partial annexation was justified under auspices of security,
with little regard to the economic output of the districts, since the British were yet to survey the region) (Fisher 1993, 1998). The remainder of the Awadh principality, including
the capital Lucknow, was annexed half a century later, and this led to the implementation of a different land-tenure system in these districts. This can be thought of as natural
experiment in close proximity to the border within the same state, thereby holding most institutions constant. Villages in close proximity to the district borders were assigned into
different land tenure system that granted property rights to the village/farmer (Mahalwari) or the local landlord (Zamindari) 1 . Furthermore, since land taxes were abolished
in India following independence in 1947, observed effects of these land tenure systems
should be purely institutional overhang and persistence, rather than being confounded
1. While there are a variety of land-tenure systems in the subcontinent, they are typically classified under
the broad categories of Raiyatwari := property rights granted to the cultivator, Mahalwari := property rights
granted to the village council, or Zamindari:= property rights granted to the local landlord. Of the two
systems under consideration in Uttar Pradesh, Mahalwari can be thought of as a hybrid between Zamindari
and Raiyawari.

by contemporary factors.
This natural experiment lends itself to a spatial regression discontinuity design (RDD)
to examine the effects of the Zamindari system on village demographics, in particular measures of sex-ratio, female labor force participation, and female literacy. Counter to the
expectation that better property rights are uniformly beneficial for socio-economic outcomes, outcomes are systematically worse for women in Mahalwari villages when compared to Zamindari villages using the RDD. The likely mechanism is the old-age support
norm in patrilineal and patrilocal societies like India (wherein sons support and house
parents in their old age, while daughters usually move to their husband’s hometown following marriage (Jayachandran 2015)). More concretely, it implies the following explanation: farmers in Mahalwari villages (through a common-ownership arrangement) had
property rights to their land, and therefore preferred male progeny to hand-down their
property to, while their contemporaries in Zamindari villages did not, since they were defacto serfs cultivating land they had very low probability of owning. Lower levels of labor
force participation and literacy among women in Mahalwari villages also suggests that the
increased bargaining power for men granted by land rights leads to lower investments in
female children, which in turn results in lower female labor participation. This mechanism
is consistent with household bargaining models wherein changes in factor endowments
(land given to the man) increases their bargaining power within the household (Wang
2014). This may lead to one agent seeking to curtail the other’s ‘outside option’, which, in
this case, is remunerated labor.
Our findings add to the burgeoning literature documenting the persistent effects of historical institutions on development outcomes, and are one of the first demonstrating the
link with demographics. Studies have documented persistent effects of property rights
institutions in a wide variety of contexts: Banerjee and Iyer (2005), Dell (2010), Hornbeck
(2010), and Haber, Maurer, and Razo (2003). The paper is closely related Banerjee and
Iyer (2005) (henceforth BI) and use localised institutional heterogeneity, land-tenure sys-

4

tems in colonial India, to study institutional persistence in determining current economic
outcomes and find that districts where the landlord was given property rights lagged in a
variety of development outcomes, especially those pertaining to agricultural investment
following the Green Revolution in the 1960s 2 .
This paper also contributes to an extensive literature that tackles the ‘missing women’
puzzle, started by Amartya Sen in a famous article that claimed that more than 100 million women are missing (Sen 1990, 1992) with the simple observation that men outnumber
women by margin too large to be consistent with biological explanations. Anderson and
Ray (2010) and Calvi (2020) decompose the gap by age and disease and argue that the
missing women problem is not simply a reflection of a gap at birth (which would suggest
that sex-selective abortion is primarily responsible for the gap), but instead that the gap
increases further along the age pyramid, which suggests that familial neglect (as a consequence of highly asymmetric bargaining power within the household) during illnesses are
likely to be a major factor in the observed gap as well. This suggests that intra-household
inequality, differential-neglect, and asymmetry in bargaining power is a likely factor driving the observed demographic gap.
This paper also contributes to an inter-disciplinary literature that attempts to link institutions and agricultural practices to modern economic and social outcomes for women
through household bargaining. This paper’s findings demonstrate the persistence of these
household dynamics by studying long run effects of a shock in the household distribution of assets. Most related to the topic at hand: two very recent papers, Almond, Li, and
Zhang (2019) and Bhalotra et al. (2019), study the effects of recent tenancy reforms in China
and West Bengal, India respectively. Like this paper, they find that tenancy reform exacerbated son preference by increasing the sex ratio. Bhalotra, Brulé, and Roy (2018),finds that
equal inheritance rights for women exacerbates son preference in India, which suggests
2. Iversen, Palmer-Jones, and Sen (2013) question these findings by pointing out that BI’s results hinge on
coding the central provinces, comprising of much of modern day Madhya Pradesh, parts of Maharashtra,
and Orissa (which are omitted from our analysis for this reason), as Zamindari districts. Omitting these areas
result in BI’s findings to shrink in substantive and statistical significance.

that changes in the costs of having daughters (through expectations of inheritance, combined with patrilocal marriage norms) are highly consequential. Our findings also relate
to Qian (2008), who finds strong evidence linking the sex ratio in China to labor-market
conditions induced by variation in tea prices, and more generally to the strong link theorised and studied in Alesina, Giuliano, and Nunn (2013), who argue that traditional agricultural practices influenced the gender division of labor and evolution of gender norms,
and find empirical evidence suggesting that descendents of groups that practiced plough
agriculture have more unequal gender norms. A major implication of this literature is
that intra-household bargaining is likely to be a major factor driving the observed demographic imbalance between male and female children in the long run (Chakraborty and
Kim 2010; Lundberg and Pollak 1993), which is consistent with the findings of this paper.
The political implications of missing women are likely highly consequential. There is
a striking gender gap in political participation in India (Prillaman 2019), wherein women
vote at lower rates at all levels of elections and participate in local democracy at alarmingly
low rates. Both large-scale cross-country (Iversen and Rosenbluth 2006) and experimental
(Chattopadhyay and Duflo 2004) studies document significant and highly consequential
differences between men and women’s policy preferences. Beaman et al. (2009) show that
exposure to women in leadership positions increases women’s political participation and
weakens stereotypes about gender roles in the public and private spheres. A lopsided
gender ratio in mahalwari villages likely exacerbates the problem of lack of role models, thereby resulting in low levels of political participation, which in turn exacerbates
the non-representativeness of women’s preferences in public policy (Pitkin 1967; Burrell
1996). Traditional conservative norms about the role of women in society are likely to persist in environments where norms regarding property rights favour male children, thereby
lowering political participation (Gottlieb and Robinson 2016). Worse labor market opportunities for women is also linked with their espousing more conservative values, thereby
perpetuating gender inequality (Blaydes and Linzer 2008). The findings of this paper of

6

institutional and demographic persistence suggest that property-rights institutions put
these two otherwise similar regions on different trajectories with regard to land rights
and norms and practices regarding the role and position of women in society (sex-ratios,
bargaining power, education and labor force participation, and political participation).
In summary, this paper tests the proposition that the intra-household distribution of
resources affects the demographic imbalance between male and female children using a
historical quasi-experiment, and finds that granting smallholders property rights it led
to worse sex ratios, female literacy, and labor force participation. The rest of the paper
is organized as follows: section 2 outlines the historical background, section 3 outlines a
conceptual framework, section 4 describes the data, section 5 explains the identification
strategy, section 6 summarises the results, and section 7 concludes.

2 Historical / Institutional Context
The Gangetic plains of North India are one of the most densely populated parts of the
world thanks to the alluvial soil along the Ganges and its tributaries. The north Indian
state under consideration in this paper, Uttar Pradesh is home to approximately 204 million people, which would make it the 5th largest country in the world by population (IWS)
at the time of measurement (2001). The region’s vast population and territory, fertile agricultural soil, and relative proximity to the old capital of Delhi has made it a prized possession for those who seek to rule India, and thus it has featured heavily in conflicts over
territory throughout Indian history (Metcalfe and Metcalfe 2006). The transitional period
between the Mughal Empire and the British colonial period was no exception.
Following a victory over the Nawab of Bengal and his French allies in the battle of
Plassey in 1757, The EIC began its gradual conquest of India, and obtained revenue collection rights in Bihar and Bengal (Fisher 1998). The revenue system implemented in Bengal
and Bihar is known as the Permanent (Zamindari) settlement, where the landlords’ rev-

7

enue dues to the government were fixed in perpetuity and the landlords were free to set
revenue terms for the peasants, thereby granting the landlords de-facto property rights
and petty chiefdom. The principality of Awadh had been an ally of the EIC since 1764
and contributed vast amounts of tribute and soldiers to its cause. However, by the turn of
the century, the EIC controlled Bengal in the East and South India, and viewed Awadh as
a weakness on the frontier, and began to plan its annexation (Fisher 1993). BI document
that, for all of India, areas conquered at later dates were less likely to have a landlord
system 3 , but the opposite is true in the regions under consideration in this paper. Mahalwari was instituted in the NWP districts that were annexed in 1801 as part of the ‘Ceded
and Conquered’ North-west Provinces, while Zamindari was instituted in the remainder
of Awadh that was annexed over half a century later.
The institutional variation in Awadh was an unforeseen consequence of the EIC’s involvement in palace intrigue. After the death of the incumbent ruler in 1797, the EIC first
supported the putative heir to the throne, then deposed him a few months later and installed Sa’adat Ali Khan, the deceased ruler’s brother, who had lived in exile under the
company’s protection for many years. The company initially demanded that he sign a
treaty transferring all the territory of Awadh to the EIC in exchange for a generous pension, but following protests, he signed a treaty that resulted in the cession of “half the
territories”4 , the loose selection of which was made on grounds of defending the EIC’s
territory against the frontier in the Northwest from the Afghans and Sikhs 5 (Fisher 1993).
3. a fact that they use to justify year of conquest as an instrument for land tenure system. However,
the exclusion restriction may be violated if the date of conquest affected other institutions that determine
contemporary growth, which is plausible.
4. Barnett (1980, p. 236) unequivocally states “There exists no adequate explanation in available records
of Wellesley’s acceptance in 1801 of half of Awadh rather than the entire state”. Barnett (1980) goes on to
argue that the available evidence suggests that the peculiar decision was made to eliminate the subsidiary
alliance, which required the presence of a British garrison in Awadh territory, which the Awadh king was
supposed to pay for but frequently shirked on, resulting in the accumulation of arrears. A full annexation
was also undesirable because it would have obliged the British to defend the Nawab in perpetuity. Hence
the decision to annex half-the-territory (with little to no interest or knowledge of which particular parts)
5. “The Nabob ceded to the Company the territory of Rohilcund, the Dooab, and Gurruckpoor, the two
former being his frontier provinces ... and the latter bordering upon the company; and, engaged, further,
to introduce a better system of management into the territories that which remained in his hands. ... The
advantage of acquiring the means of placing upon this weak point additional numbers of the British troops,

The annexation is illustrated in the juxtaposed maps of the region in Figure 1 in 1795
(L) and 1805 (R). Awadh then remained under a state of ‘indirect rule’ wherein a representative of the East India company was present, but the company had next to no other
institutional or bureaucratic presence (Fisher 1998). In the region of Awadh incorporated
into the United Provinces in 1801, the land tenure arrangements were a continuation of
the extant community/village based system in the Northwest, called the Mahalwari. In
the Mahalwari system, the ‘village bodies that jointly owned the village were responsible
for land revenue’ (BI, p. 1194). These villages were also known as ‘bhaichara’ (brotherhood) communities and were praised by reform-minded British bureaucrats like Metcalfe
and Holt Mackenzie. In this region, the land tenure revenue settlements were “avowedly
short term, providing for two three-year and one four-year settlements” (Stokes 1983).

partial annexation of Awadh in 1801, Joppen (1914)
The British annexed the remainder of the principality of Awadh in 1856 under the
auspices of ‘mismanagement’ (Fisher 1998; Barry 2019). This thought to have been one of
the key factors precipitating in the sepoy mutiny in 1857 (also considered the first war of
and thereby increasing its strength, and the general security of the provinces.”, Arthur Wellesley (majorgeneral and brother of Richard Wellesley, the Governor-General - the head of the British administration of
India), Memorandum on Marquess Wellesley’s Government of India, reproduced in Fisher (1993)

9

Independence in India)(Kochanek and Hardgrave 2007). Following the mutiny, the British
decided that they needed support from the landed aristocracy in the region and thereby
implemented a system of tax revenue that closely resembled the Zamindari system (Stokes
1983). Landlords, called talukdars in the region, were given property rights, but their dues
were not fixed in perpetuity like in Bihar and Bengal. The vast majority of cultivators
in this region were effectively at-will share-croppers (Stokes 1983) who paid a share of
their output to the ‘malik’ (typically a landlord who was a de-facto petty chief and had
titles to land in several villages), and could be expelled from their land for failing to fulfil
frequently exorbitant demands.
In summary, the region ended up with a mix of Zamindari and Mahalwari districts: Zamindari was implemented in Bihar and Awadh, while Mahalwari was implemented in the
rest of Uttar Pradesh (as illustrated in fig 2)6 . The border between the districts of Awadh
incorporated into the ceded territories in 1805 and those annexed with the remainder of
Awadh in 1856 was largely arbitrary and based on the complicated politics of the indirect rule system, rather than underlying economic and geographical characteristics on the
ground. This allows me to exploit the border and the resultant institutional heterogeneity
as a natural experiment. This criterion is less likely to be fulfilled by other land-tenure
discontinuities in India, which are typically along state borders, which amount to a severe
compound treatment problem since states often have very different histories and many
policies change at the state border. For example, the border between Uttar Pradesh and
Bihar (which were part of different empires in the pre-colonial Period and had very different trajectories post-Independence). We therefore restrict ourselves to estimating the
treatment effect at the within-Uttar Pradesh boundary of late-period Awadh.

3 Conceptual Framework
Development is a multi-faceted process that can be thought of as a function of a variety of
processes, including property rights and gender equality, among other things. Applying
the theory of the second best (Lipsey and Lancaster 1956) reasoning to this context, one
may claim that when the ex-ante equilibrium values are far from the optimum, simply
moving one of the inputs towards the social-welfare-maximising value (granting property
rights) may in fact result in lower values of another input (gender equity), and potentially
even lower overall social welfare 7 . This is entirely plausible in the context of India in the
colonial period, where many markets were missing, and it is almost certain that social
welfare was not maximised, even with the existing technology and institutions.
More concretely, property rights may affect the sex-ratio through a simple mechanism
in that they endow the man with property to pass on to descendants, which likely increases son-preference given the marriage institution in North India. One way for this
to occur is if a rational household (almost certainly headed by a man in this context) can
increase future welfare by endowing their progeny a factor of production (agricultural
land), thereby increasing their future income stream when they grow old. Since women
in North India get married into other villages and emigrate from their village of birth (exogamy), the likelihood of this future income stream being realised is greatly increased if the
household has a son. In fact, in most places in north India, women are essentially cut off
from their families following marriage, which means that inheritance passed on to them
is effectively a transfer to a different household. This creates a very strong incentives for
son preference (through differential neglect, female infanticide, or sex-selective abortion,
though the latter was unavailable until the late 20th century) the 50:50 ratio of male to
7. Define A social welfare function: W = f (x1 , x2 ), where x1 is a measure of property rights, and x2 is a
measure of gender equity. W is maximised at W ∗ = f (x∗1 , x∗2 ). Because of a variety of market failures, the
ex-ante equilibrium may be S̃ = f (x˜1 , x˜2 ). The Lipsey-Lancaster argument in this context is that moving x1
alone in the direction of the optimal (from x˜1 towards x∗1 ) may result in values of x2 s.t. x2 < x˜2 < x∗2 , and
S < S̃ < S ∗ .

12

female progeny, it will choose to do so in order to increase its future utility. This implies
that heritable property results in son-preference in a completely rational framework. A
simple 2-period model in the appendix (C) formalises this argument, and illustrates that
∂z
∂θ

> 0 (where z is the extent of deviation from the 50:50 sex-ratio that would naturally

occur, which is controlled by the family, and θ is a parameter for property rights), so one
would expect the granting of property rights to men in a system with female exogamy to
yield more unbalanced sex ratios. Thus, a key channel through which property rights are
likely to contribute to increasing the sex ratio is through the realisation of future income by
male progeny and not female ones. This happens because of the institution of exogamous
marriage in the region.
Granting property rights to men may also lead to a decrease in female literacy and labor force participation under canonical household bargaining models. Worse labor market and educational outcomes for women being accompanied with higher income and
productive capacity is consistent with a household bargaining framework in the spirit
of Lundberg and Pollak (1993), as articulated (albiet verbally) by (Chakraborty and Kim
2010). Literacy (which is a form of human capital, albeit a minimal one) increases the
woman’s ‘outside option’ from participating in the labor market, and increases her bargaining power in household decisions, and thus it is in the interest of the man to curtail
it. Since property rights grant the man with control over the single most important factor
of production in an agricultural household, he can use this to limit the outside option for
the woman, thereby resulting in lower literacy and labor force participation. Even though
the woman working would increase the overall household budget, it would decrease the
man’s bargaining power, and the man therefore trades off a larger household budget for
higher bargaining power. This may be compounded by (or feed into) conservative social
mores: women not ‘having to work’ enhances a family’s social standing in society in many
developing countries. That female labor force participation as a whole has been shrinking in a time of very high economic growth in India suggests that this effect dominates in

13

India (Economist 2018).

4 Data
The primary dataset analysed in this paper are the 2001 village-level geocoded Indian
census 8 , obtained from ML Infomap (Infomap 2001), and district-level land-tenure classifications from Banerjee and Iyer (2005). BI classify 166 districts in colonial India by landtenure systems, 83 of which are in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. Spatially merging these districts to the village level shapefiles and restricting the data to within 2 decimal degrees of
the relevant borders yields an analysis sample of 119,223 villages across the states of Uttar
Pradesh and Bihar 9 . The primary results of the paper are based on the sample within
Uttar Pradesh, which includes 47,237 villages.
This paper’s spatial regression discontinuity identification strategy relies on contiguous districts with different land-tenure systems holding other institutions (such as state
governments) constant as far as possible. This data restriction is exacerbated by the fact
that Banerjee and Iyer (2005)’s classification of colonial era districts only covers approximately 200 of India’s 600 or so districts, so the spatial contiguity requirement limits potential regions to north India. So,we focus on a region of India that is unambiguously
classified as one of the two systems. In particular, the paper focuses on Uttar Pradesh,
where the British implemented a mix of land-tenure systems because of complexities arising from initial (quasi-) independence of the principality of Awadh, and its subsequent
annexation following the sepoy mutiny of 1857. To our knowledge, the within-UP boundary between Awadh and non-Awadh districts is the only such boundary in contemporary
India.
Iversen, Palmer-Jones, and Sen (2013) critique BI on their classification of the erstwhile
Central Provinces as Zamindari areas (modern day provinces of Madhya Pradesh and

9. I define a village as a geographical unit classified as ‘village’ by the census with a population ≥ 100

14

Chhatisgarh), so I omit the southern Bundelkhand region of Uttar Pradesh, which is close
to the central Provinces. This yields an analysis sample of the province of Uttar Pradesh,
where, the identification strategy is bolstered by the natural experiment produced by the
staggered annexation of the principality of Awadh described in section 2.
Since the primary dataset used in the analysis is the population census, some measures that would have been desirable for analysis that would elucidate mechanisms are
unavailable. The most notable is the absence of population counts disaggregated by age,
which would allow us to test the differential neglect hypothesis and document the extent
to which the imbalanced sex ratio is stable across the age distribution. This would also
serve as an indirect test of the Anderson and Ray (2010) finding that a large part of the
missing women imbalance arises well after infancy. Unfortunately, the census data is not
disaggregated by age and therefore does not permit this potentially interesting analysis.
Future research on this question may be able to use geo-located household level census
datasets that are as yet unavailable.

Summary Statistics

Summary statistics for the relevant variables for the Awadh analysis sample are presented
in table 1 10 . The average sex-ratio in the region(1.11) is well above what one would naturally expect (1.05), and as illustrated in fig 3, the average is slightly higher in Mahalwari
villages compared to Zamindari ones. This is especially noticeable in the bottom panel in
fig 3, which plots the share of villages with each type of land-tenure institution conditional on having a particular value of the sex-ratio. Mahalwari villages are far likelier to
have higher sex ratios (especially on the upper end of the spectrum, beyond the overall
mean of 1.1).
However, in order to make a causal claim about the effects of land-tenure institutions
on demographics, we need it to be the case that the ‘treatment’ (land-tenure) is uncorre10. Balance tables for the corresponding samples are reported in B.1. The unit of observation throughout
the analysis is a village.

lated with other factors that may drive modern day demographics 11 . There is no reason
to believe that the land tenure system in different districts of North India is exogenous;
district level policies may drive differences in the sex-ratio that have nothing to do with
the property rights institutions under consideration, and this may bias results. Thus, a
naive comparison of various development outcomes between Zamindari and Raiyatwari
districts is likely to be biased. This necessitates the analysis of a more localised variation
in institutions where the exogeneity condition is more plausible.

4.2

Border Identification

Fortunately, given the availability of high-resolution spatial data for the village-level census, one can alleviate this problem by zooming in and comparing villages that were on different sides of district (and land-tenure system) borders 12 , where the land-tenure system
can plausibly be exogenous (since geography, climate are very similar in villages within
11. This is simply the exogeneity condition( E(Xϵ) = 0) for OLS. Put differently, since we know there is
omitted variables bias (OVB), the only way that the ‘short regression’ coefficient is unbiased is if either (1)
the omitted variable is uncorrelated with Y or (2) the omitted variable is uncorrelated with X. Neither
assumption is likely to be true for the entire sample of villages

50 kilometres of each other on either side of the border. We test formally for this using
rainfall and FAO crop suitability data and find no statistically detectable difference at the
border). This is especially plausible given that the border between the districts that comprised of the boundary between Awadh (‘Oudh’ in figure 1) and the rest of North India
was largely exogenous and was part of the ‘half-the-territory’ partitioning in the treaty in
1801 (Fisher 1998).
Given the high population density (and correspondingly high disaggregation of administrative units) in the region, one can zoom in very close to the border and still have
enough sample size to estimate the effects of Mahalwari systems. We omit the boundary between the North-western Provinces and the Central Provinces (modern day Uttar
Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh - on the south- western end of UP in the map below), in accordance with Iversen, Palmer-Jones, and Sen (2013)’s claim that CP’s land tenure systems
were highly heterogeneous and BI’s findings were sensitive to how these were coded. All
across-state boundaries are eliminated from the analysis, so the boundaries that separate
treatment and control regions are all within the state of Uttar Pradesh, which alleviates
concerns regarding major institutional variation at the cutoff.
We subset the analysis sample to within 1 decimal degrees (≈ 100 km) of the border
between Zamindari and non-Zamindari districts. These degree to km conversions are approximate and are correct for 23 degrees North of the equator, which is the region of the
globe for North India. The buffers are constructed using the shapefiles using the original
WGS-84 EPSG-4326 projection.

. The bandwidth (distance from the border) is chosen by

a data driven selection procedure for the regression discontinuity design with Euclidian
distance as the running variable. We report OLS regression coefficients for a very large
number of bandwidths and specifications in the appendix 5.1.
13. Since we are considering very small bandwidths, the choice of Euclidian, as opposed to
Haversine/Great-circle, distance is inconsequential for estimated distances. This is because for small distances, the earth can be approximated by a flat plane, therefore justifying the choice of Euclidian distance.
When larger distances are involved, however, the choice of projection matters a great deal.

5.1

Least Squares on Boundary Samples

As an interpretable benchmark case, we first estimate ordinary least squares regressions
on a sub-sample of villages close to the border between historically Zamindari and Raiyatwari regions (the ’control’ and ’treatment’ in our sample respectively) for which confounders (geography, other demographic characteristics etc.) can be plausibly believed to
be similar on both sides of the border. We run regressions of the form:

19

Yijb = α + βMahalwarij + γMahalwarij × spij + ϕb + ϵi

s.t. |sij | ≤ k ∀k = {0.5, 0.4995, . . . , 0.0001}

) for village i in district j, Mahalwarij is a dummy variable for whether district

j is classified as a Mahalwari district (i.e. a non-landlord system), and ϕb is a vector of
line-segment fixed effects (which are constructed by dividing the border between the Zamindari and Mahalwari districts into 10 equal-length segments and generating dummies,
which ensures that the estimation compares villages on either side of the same part of
the boundary), and sij is distance to the border with a pth order of the spline; 0 means
no spline. Heteroskedasticity-Robust standard errors are presented throughout

17

, and

results with Conley standard errors are presented in the appendix [sec D.1] and are substantively similar.

5.2

Spatial Regression Discontinuity Design

The sharp RD estimate is evaluated as the difference between the CEFs of the ‘treated’
and ‘control’ groups evaluated at the cutoff (Imbens and Lemieux 2008). In the current
applied econometrics literature, the treatment effect is estimated using flexible local-linear
regressions to approximate conditional expectation functions on either side of the cutoff,
consistent with Hahn, Todd, and Van der Klaauw (2001), which shows that if the average
potential outcomes are continuous functions of the score at c, the sharp-RD treatment

17. the analysis sample has an insufficient number of districts for clustering at the district level to be viable,
even though the treatment is assigned at the district level

20

effects is the difference between the CEFs at c.

18

The intuition behind this result is that if

we believe that potential confounders for ‘treated’ and ‘control’ units are smooth functions
at the cutoff c, we can treat them as a nuisance parameter and isolate the treatment effect
by estimating the expectation functions conditional on the running variable flexibly on
either side of the threshold.
To this end, we use the robust local-linear regression based regression-discontinuity
design estimator and confidence intervals proposed in Calonico, Cattaneo, and Titiunik
(2014) (henceforth CCT 2014) 19 .we first construct Euclidian distance Distanceij to the nearest point on the Zamindari-Raiyatwari district boundary, where negative values denote
landlord villages and positive values denote Mahalwari villages, and use this distance as
a running variable with a cutoff at Distance = 0. The estimating equation is the following
regression

Yijb = α + γ1[D≤0] f (Distanceij ) + ψ1[D>0] g(Distanceij ) + ϕb + ϵi
where 1D>0 is the indicator function for non-Zamindari villages, f and g are smooth
functions of distance on a bandwidth h 20 , ϕb are line-segment fixed effects, which ensure
that villages on either side of the same border are compared 21 . A triangular kernel is used
to weight the observations closest to the cutoff heavily and decreasing in either direction

where B and V represent the bias and variance of the RD point estimator τ̂ , and p is the degree of the
polynomial (Cattaneo, Idrobo, and Titiunik 2018)
21. This requires an ad-hoc partitioning of the border into a finite number of segments, since in theory a
line of finite length can be subset into an infinite number of line segments (Keele and Titiunik 2015). We
construct 20 and find that the substantive conclusions remain the same for a variety of choices for the line
segment count

21

on the interval [c−h, c+h]. Using alternative kernels and estimating with and without biascorrection yields substantively and statistically similar results. We also use an alternative
method of estimating a spatial regression discontinuity designs: a parametric specification
that includes separate cubic polynomials for longitude and latitude (first popularised by
Dell (2010)) and report them in the appendix section D.2. These also yield substantively
similar results with wider standard errors.

6 Results
6.1

Least Squares on Boundary Samples Results

The following regressions are estimated using the framework outlined in 5.1 close to the
boundaries of the Awadh principality22 , which compares villages within the state of Uttar
Pradesh, and robust (HC2) standard errors are reported. While one might be concerned
that estimating the same regressions on the entire sample will be driven by villages on
the boundary between Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, which are different states and have had
different political parties in power (and consequently different political and economic institutions), these results serve as an approximate check of the transportability validity of
the main estimates and are presented in the appendix D.5. The direction of the effect on
sex-ratio, female literacy, and female labor force participation is identical, and the magnitudes are slightly smaller but statistically significant for the larger sample.
To rule out the possibility that arbitrary choices of buffer are responsible for the observed effect,we estimate 100 separate regressions for each outcome to test the stability
of the coefficient for different bandwidths j (drawn from a decreasing sequence from 0.5
to 0, with a step of 0.005). The results for this coefficient stability exercise are plotted in
5). Each point in these graphs is the estimated β̂j for Mahalwari villages estimated on
the sample of villages s.t. distance to border si ≤ j ∀i, j = {0.5, 0.4995, . . . , 0.000001},

with its corresponding (robust) standard error in blue. Moving to the right on the X axis
illustrates the estimated β̂ on progressively narrower buffers; a relatively stable pattern indicates that high-leverage outlier villages are not driving the estimated effect (since they
are almost certainly dropped as the cutoff gets narrower). The estimate switching signs
with narrower cutoffs (such as for female literacy) suggests that a simple comparison of
means was inadequate for that outcome, especially since the effect remains negative and
stable for all subsequent thresholds. Figures with linear and quadratic spline included in
the D.4.

is wide. The estimates are closer to the preferred specification and sample on the right of
the figure (i.e. bandwidth of 10 km and 5 km). Corresponding figures with the linear and
quadratic splines are reported in fig D.4

Distance Regression Discontinuity Results

Tables 2, 3, and 4 report local-linear and robust regression discontinuity estimates, robust
standard errors, and the number of observations used in the estimation on either side of
the cutoff for sex ratio, female literacy, and female labor force participation respectively.
The SRD coefficient is calculated as the difference between the local polynomial regression
functions (linear in columns 1 and 3, and quadratic in 2 and 4), with line-segment fixed
effects as controls (in column 3 and 4). The CCT bandwidths are different on the two sides
of the threshold and are reported in the table alongside the corresponding number of
observations. In our preferred specifications (which include linear CEF and line-segment
fixed effects - column 3 in all three tables below), Mahalwari villages have 0.0151 more men
per woman (in more interpretable terms: 1.51 additional men for every 100 women relative
to Zamindari regions, which is 1.5% higher than the control mean, 1.1). The sign and
magnitudes of the effects are comparable to those found in the OLS estimation (reported
in 5.1) and are more precisely estimated. The effects on female literacy and labor force
participation are marginally significant upon the inclusion of segment fixed effects (t-stat
≈ 1.8 − 1.9 in column 3 in tables 3 and 4). While results reported in tables 2, 3, and 4
are estimated using local-linear regressions, results for quadratic CEFs are visually and
quantitatively similar and presented in figure 6.

Robustness Checks

6.3.1

Controls in OLS

The primary estimates in this paper do not include controls (beyond line-segment fixed
effects, which are meant to ensure that geographically proximate villages are compared)
because most plausible development outcomes that may be in the error term are themselves likely to be outcomes of the notional ‘experiment’ (that of allocating different land
tenure arrangements) because of the long gap between the measurement of Y (2001 census) and X (which were determined by 1860), and thus will bias the estimated coefficient
for land-tenure. Furthermore, given the research design, potential confounders can expected to be smooth at the discontinuity, since the estimation sample is a narrow band
along the border.
Despite this, we use the limited number of controls available at the village level : population size, caste composition (Chakraborty and Kim (2010) document more balanced sex
ratios among ‘lower’ caste groups), luminosity (as a proxy of income, aggregated to the
village level from DMSP rasters, NOAA) to test the robustness of RD results. We report

results for specifications with controls in table 5. The first column includes all villages in
the sample and therefore the result is likely biased (because the argument about balance
in controls around the narrow band around the border no longer applies) because of omitted variables bias. Columns 2-4, however, rely on similar specifications to those in 6.1 and
are reasonably credible (because they subset to a narrow band around the border). The
estimated coefficients for sex ratio are significantly larger upon the inclusion of controls,
which suggests that the covariance between Mahalwari and the controls is nonzero.
6.3.2

Testing for sorting across the border

An obvious check for the validity of the regression discontinuity design is to look at
whether there is sorting across the discontinuity. To this end, we report the density of
the observations by Euclidian distance to the border in fig 7. Sorting is implausible in this
particular context, since simply moving from a Zamindari village to a Mahalwari one does
not entitle a farmer to land; he (or his forbears) must have been present there during the
distribution of titles in the early Nineteenth century. Because the unit of observation in

the analysis is a village, we face the additional complication that there are mechanically
more villages on the mahalwari side because they tend to be smaller in area than zamindari villages (because more smallholders own their land), which shows up in the mass of
villages close to the border on the zamindari side in 7. Because households aren’t entitled
to land on the other side of the border, there is little reason to suspect manipulation of the
running variable (McCrary 2008). Nevertheless, the heuristic check of the ‘donut test’, to
test whether agents sort across to the favourable side when close to the cutoff, leaving a
large chasm in the density plot on one of the two sides of the cutoff, appears to pass in fig
7.

It is also possible to assess the validity of the RD by checking if other plausible (observable) factors that may determine the sex ratio and labor market conditions for women
vary discontinuously across the border. Neither Male labor force participation (which
is a useful placebo because in theory, potential labor market imperfections should affect

7 Conclusion
This paper finds that villages where Mahalwari was implemented have systematically worse
outcomes for women on a variety of measures: sheer numbers (the sex ratio), literacy, and
labor force participation. The observed effects are consistent with a mechanism whereby
the presence of heritable land in the household exacerbates culturally widespread son
preference, and increased bargaining power for men results in worse female labor force
and literacy outcomes. This paper documents the adverse side-effects of institutions that

have generally been considered beneficial for development, in particular agricultural investment (as documented in Banerjee and Iyer (2005), though questioned by Iversen, PalmerJones, and Sen (2013)). While this may be true, the findings of this paper suggest that these
institutions also entrench intra-household inequalities and hierarchies.
As with any research design that relies on a regression discontinuity, these findings are
only plausibly causal near the cutoff (which, in this case, is the border between the Awadh
principality’s districts in 1801 AD), and therefore can only be extrapolated to other contexts when buttressed by plausible mechanisms and theory. The paper suggests some
generalisable mechanisms for the observed effect, but these cannot be tested using available data. The ideal (hypothetical) experiment to study the effects of land-tenure systems
would block-randomise land-tenure systems and collect individual and household level
data on labor supply, fertility, and consumption rather than relying on village level aggregates. Furthermore, since the discontinuity in question is a geographical and adminis-

33

trative one, additional work must be done to verify that the boundary in question is truly
exogenous (which we attempt to do with historical sources in section 2). In addition to
this, since the boundaries in question are administrative, it is possible that a ‘compound
treatment’ problem (Keele and Titiunik 2015) may arise such that the observed difference
is not merely the result of land-tenure institutions but of district level policies adopted
subsequently. While this is unlikely given that district level governance in India is not
sizeable and most policies are adopted at the state level, it is a limitation worth keeping in
mind.
The policy implications of this paper are not, however, that serfdom-like agricultural
institutions that existed in Zamindari villages are preferable to giving property rights to
the cultivator or village bodies; overall welfare was likely worse in Zamindari villages.
This paper’s findings simply suggest that the effects of institutions are mediated by existing socio-economic relations. Property rights may serve to cement or exacerbate existing
inequalities as they may exist in a given environment regardless of their (likely positive)
first-order effects on investment and consumption. Findings from economic history such
as this one are useful because they dissuade from silver-bullet thinking, especially one
that has been championed vociferously as property rights.

B Summary Statistics and Balance Tables
B.1 Balance Tables
Here,we report treatment and control means and standard errors for potential confounders,
the difference in means, as well as standardised difference in means, defined by Imbens and
Rubin (2015) as
X − Xc
√ t
(σ̂t2 + σ̂c2 ) /2
where X̄t and σ̂t are treatment mean and standard deviations respectively. The normalisation is desirable because a t-test of equality of means mechanically yields low pvalues of equal means in large samples (like the ones under consideration), even though
the underlying covariate balance may be reasonable. When normalised, the rule of thumb
is that a difference in means of less than 0.5 implies that the overlap condition is less likely
to have been violated. By this heuristic, the zamindari and non-zamindari samples are
well balanced along observables.

C Household Model with Exogamy and Endogenous SexSelection
Households live for 2 periods, and receive endowments of income (y1 , y2 ) in the first and
second period respectively. They decide how much to consume (c1 ) and how much to save
(s) for the next generation in the first period in order to consume c2 in the second period.
The household discounts future utility by a discount factor β. The household’s utility is
time-separable, so the household’s preferences are given by
U (c1 , c2 ) = u(c1 ) + βu(c2 )
Credit markets are non-existent, so the household cannot borrow to finance consumption, or save through any channel outside property. The share of saving that passes into
the next period is controlled by an exogenous parameter θ, which denotes property rights
23
. If the household has no property rights, θ is zero.
The household’s maximisation problem is:
max U (c1 , c2 ) s.t.

c1 ,c2 ,s

c1 + s = y 1
c2 = θs + y2

(3)
(4)
(5)

Since there is no utility for positive savings at the end of the two periods, the constraints
are binding. Substituting s from (1.2) into (1.3) yields a lifetime budget constraint :
c1 +

y2
c2
= y1 +
θ

This yields a simplified optimisation problem of the form:
max U (c1 , c2 ) s.t.

The Lagrangian can be written as

[

L(c1 , c2 , λ) = u(c1 ) + βu(c2 ) + λ y1 +

The solution to this problem is:
23. This is identical to the conventional 2 period model where borrowing is permitted, except θ = (1 + r)
where r is the interest rate.

F OC(c2 ) →u′ (c2 ) =

Putting together the first 2 FOCs yields the following Euler equation:
u′ (c1 )
=θ
βu′ (c2 )
Under a no-property-rights regime (θ = 0), so the problem reduces to 2 separate optimisation problems for each time period (which is equivalent to perfect impatience where
future utility is discounted fully i.e. β = 0). So, the optimal consumption for the household is to consume the entire income in each period (i.e. c∗t = yt ).
However, if the household has property rights (θ > 0), then it will save for the next
∂s
generation (s∗ = y1 − c∗1 > 0). Therefore, ∂θ
> 0, i.e. savings are increasing in property
rights.

C.1 Exogamy and Sex-selection
Now, let us introduce gender of the progeny and exogamy into the model. Define progeny
ζ = {m, f }, (male and female) where p(ζ = m) = 0.5 + z, where z is a household’s choice
parameter and represents the fact that the household can increase the likelihood of a male
child through sex-selective abortion / differential neglect / female infanticide. Let this be
bounded under 0.1 (or some other arbitrary number ψ below 0.5, because otherwise the
solution only yields male children, which is biologically unsustainable and inconsistent
with reality).
Exogamy: Furthermore, let it be the case that female progeny are married into another
village and do not contribute to the household’s budget, so saving for them is ineffective
(i.e. s does not enter into the 2nd period budget if ζ = f ). So, the θs component in the 2nd
period budget only gets realised if the household’s child is male. This effectively means
that the expectation of the saving component of the budget is (0.5+z)θs+0×(1−(0.5+z)) =
(0.5 + z)θs.
The household’s problem is now
max U (c1 , c2 ) s.t.

c1 ,c2 ,s,z

c1 + s = y1
c2 = θ(0.5 + z)s + y2
z ≤ 0.1
The lifetime budget constraint is

45

c1 +

c2
y2
= y1 +
θ(0.5 + z)
θ(0.5 + z)

and the Lagrangian is:
]
y2

− c1 −
+ µ[z − 0.1]
L(c1 , c2 , λ, µ) = u(c1 ) + βu(c2 ) + λ y1 +
(0.5 + z)θ
(0.5 + z)θ
[

The solution to this problem is:
F OC(c1 ) →u′ (c1 ) = λ
λ
(0.5 + z)θ
c2
y2
F OC(λ) →c1 +
= y1 +
(0.5 + z)θ

F OC(µ) →z = 0.1

F OC(c2 ) →u′ (c2 ) =

u′ (c1 )
= (0.5 + z)θ
βu′ (c2 )
Under a no-property-rights regime (θ = 0), the last constraint is slack (µ = 0), so
z = 0, and therefore there is no son preference and the solution is the same as the noproperty-rights solution above (since s is not included in the 2nd period budget regardless
of the gender of the progeny, and households consume whatever income they have in each
period). However, under a property rights system (θ > 0, the household will prefer sons
because that increases 2nd period consumption, so z ∗ = 0.1 (or whatever else we set the
> 0. This simple model illustrates
upper bound on son-preference to be). In summary, ∂z
∂θ
that in a model with exogamy and endogenous sex-selection, households will prefer sons
if they have property rights (which endow them with more consumption in the future).

Conley Standard Errors

This section reports regression estimates with spatially autocorrelated error terms known
as Conley standard errors (Conley 1999). We use fairly conservative bandwidths that allow for standard errors to be correlated over 200, 100, and 50 km respectively for the 3
estimation samples.

Parametric Spatial Regression Discontinuity

We estimate parametric regressions with smooth polynomial functions of 2 running variables (longitude and latitude) per (Dell 2010). Keele and Titiunik (2015) contend that
Dell (2010)’s approach is limited by the fact that the longitude and latitude are the same
for all households contained in the same cluster (district), even though the relevant unit
of observation for all estimating equations is at the household level. Since we have geographical coordinates for the centroids for each village (rather than simply the district
that contains the village, which would be the analogue to the Dell, 2010 case), the semiparametric regression is a sub-optimal estimation technique for the available data and is
reported as a check for the non-parametric estimates, which are more flexibly estimated
and make full use of the data. The functional form f is a cubic polynomial for latitude and
longitude as well as an interaction term between the two.
Yijb = α + βMahalwarij + f (Locationij ) + ϕb + ϵijb
D.2.1 Parametric RD Coefficient Stability for Bandwidth choices
Using the methodology outlined in section 5.1, we estimate 100 different regressions with
the parametric estimating equation in section D.2 to rule out the possibility that particular
choices of bandwidth yield the observed effect. We report results in A2 The coefficient
remains large, stable, and statistically significant as one zooms in (illustrated by moving
from left to right on the graph). The observed difference in female labor force participation
rate is small and statistically insignificant from this estimation strategy.
