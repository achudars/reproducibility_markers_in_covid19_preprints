Introduction
Open access mandates are setting standards on how to publish open access, as well as indicate
the timeframe in which these goals are supposed to be reached. The Dutch and UK Open
Access mandates promote the Gold Open Access model for publishing while the EU Open
Access mandate, as well as that of a number of countries indicate either a mix of Gold and
Green (e.g. Switzerland) or advocate directly Green publishing (e.g. Denmark). With respect
to timeliness, the Dutch Open Access mandate has been set first at 2024, according to a letter
send to Dutch parliament by Sander Dekker (Dekker, 2015), which was later shortened
towards 2020, with the end of the Horizon 2020 programme by the EU (Dekker, 2016).
Another change involved the targeted types of output: while the initial goals set were
supposed to be inclusive of all types, such as books, journal publications, chapters in books,
the more recent adjustment of the targets excluded books within the 100% open access goals
for the Dutch science system. The UK clearly indicated that for the next REF, the national
assessment of research that occurs in the UK periodically, can only cover those outputs that
have been published in open access format, in which the Gold route was preferred.
Parallel to the OA development, taken up both nationally as well supra-nationally, European
and thus also Dutch academics are confronted with an increasing pressure to cooperate
scientifically with European partners, via the consortia obligations expressed via for example
EU funding instruments such as those under the more recent Framework programmes. So we
notice for many years an increasing tendency to internationally collaborate for European
science (van Leeuwen, 2008).
The results presented in this study are part of a larger analysis in which CWTS supports the
University and Royal Library system (UKB) in the Netherlands in their negotiations with the
publishing industry, oriented towards the so called Big Deals. In this study, the question arose
to what extent Dutch output was directly under the Big deals, that mean, a situation in which
any publication with a Netherlands based author as corresponding author was involved, would
get OA format published. The choice for corresponding author was a second best approach, as

1546

STI Conference 2018 · Leiden
the preferred choice for this analysis would have been submitting author. As this is not
available, corresponding authorships was considered the best option for the study. In this
analysis, also scientific cooperation was considered as an important element of the way output
was created, and how that linked to OA publishing, so indirectly to the Dutch OA Mandate.
The main research question here is: to what extent is the Dutch OA mandate hindered by EU
policies to increasingly work together internationally for EU scientists (for example via EU
Framework programmes, such as Horizon2020) ?

Data and methods
Labeling of WoS data with OA tags is based upon the methodology developed in previous
analyses (van Leeuwen et al, 2017). This method of tagging WoS publications with OA labels
is somewhat different compared to the one applied by Dutch colleagues (Bosman & Kramer,
2018), in which only Unpaywall data are used to tag publications with OA labels. WoS data
for this study are derived from the CWTS in-house version of WoS. Information on the
addresses for Dutch universities is retrieved from the in-house address database on top of the
CWTS WoS database, similar as is used for the Leiden Ranking (Leiden Ranking, 2017,
Waltman et al, 2012). The data cover the period 2009-2016, taking into consideration articles,
letters and reviews.
Corresponding authorship is derived from WoS immediately, by following the reprint
organizations address, which is connected to authors in WoS from 2009 onwards. The method
we followed here is similar to what has been used by Austrian colleagues in tagging the
output from Austria with OA labels, using the corresponding authorship labels from WoS.
(Gumpenberger et al, 2018). This allows the distinction between all publications form the
Netherlands, and the publication output for which we can establish Dutch corresponding
authorship.
We also use the classification CWTS applied in studies analysing scientific cooperation types.
For such analyses, a relatively straightforward typology has been designed (Moed et al, 1995),
which divides output in three different types: publications with only one address (Single
institute, or SI), papers with two country names, hence indicative of international cooperation
(International cooperation, or IC), and finally, all those papers that carry several addresses
within one country (National cooperation, or NC).

Results
Let us describe the landscape first in which we position the analysis. Therefore we have to
first show the numbers of publications produced by Dutch universities in the period 20092016. The overall results of the output analysis are shown in Figure 1, in which we include
the overall output of Dutch universities, the total number of publications is shown in the left
panel, as well as the total OA output from Dutch universities. Furthermore, also the share of
OA compared to the total output of Dutch universities is shown, next to Gold and Green OA
output numbers. The share of OA output is relatively stable, fluctuating around 40% of the
total output.

In Figure 1 right panel we show the same configuration as displayed in Figure 1 left panel,
here only limited to the output from Dutch universities on which Dutch academics are
corresponding author. In the right panel we observe a certain stagnation of the number of
publications on which Dutch academics are corresponding authors. The number of OA format
published papers is fluctuating, consequently the share of OA format published outputs as
corresponding author fluctuates as well. This share of OA format published output as
corresponding author is slightly lower in comparison with the share of all OA format
published outputs.
In Figure 2, we show the comparison of the Dutch output resulting from corresponding
authorships, in comparison with the total Dutch output, and the various ways to depict OA
publishing. We note that the share of the Dutch academic output that results from
corresponding authorships in comparison with the total production of Dutch universities,
slowly diminishes. The OA share of the total OA output is recovering a bit, due to an increase
of the number of Green OA publications in the last two years of the analysis.

Next, we shift our focus towards the way the Dutch academic production of scientific journals
pares has developed, across three types of scientific cooperation, both for the full set as well
as for the set of publications in which Dutch academics are corresponding authors. This is
displayed in Figure 3. In Figure 3, in the left panel, we clearly note that Dutch output
development is driven by an increasing intensification of international collaboration. National

1548

STI Conference 2018 · Leiden
cooperation and single address publications show a stable pattern, with a slight decrease of the
latter, and slight increase of the former. In the right panel, the output related to corresponding
authorships are depicted. First, we clearly note that the overall output in which the Dutch
academics are leading is stagnating in the later stages of the period of analysis, while the
international scientific cooperation output surpasses the single address output (which by
definition covers a substantial part of the corresponding authorship output). The observed
stagnation of Dutch corresponding authorship output is mainly due to output resulting from
national cooperation (in which non-academic research institutions apparently more often take
corresponding authorships).

In Figure 4, we show the composition of the output that results from Dutch academic
international scientific cooperation. In the left panel, we show the overall situation, while the
right panel contains the composition of the output in which Dutch academics are
corresponding authors. While we notice a more or less continuous increase in the number of
publications that are published in OA format in the total output resulting from international
cooperation, we find a somewhat more fluctuating pattern in the development of the output
that results from international scientific collaboration in which Dutch academics are
corresponding authors.

In Figure 5, we present the relative share of the Dutch corresponding authorship output in
comparison to the total output, that results from international scientific cooperation. Like we

1549

STI Conference 2018 · Leiden
observed for the overall output, we observe a decreasing trend, albeit not so sharp we
observed for the total Dutch output. The decrease means that in international scientific
cooperation relationships, the Dutch have lesser corresponding authorships. Whether this
means that academic leaderships by the Dutch university world is under pressure is a topic for
another study, the increasing output number over the last decades, as can be concluded form
the increasing numbers measured in numerous bibliometric studies, in combination with an
intensifying of international scientific cooperation due to requirements connected to funding
In FP-6 and FP-7, scientific cooperation with South European countries was obligatory, in
Horizon 2020, Eastern European partners have to be part of consortia. This brings of course
also sharing authorships among more partners, from an increasing number of countries. The
OA format shares of the international collaboration output shows a rather varying pattern,
with a first Gold OA important in 2012, while later, in 2015 and 2016, the Green OA format
share of the output resulting from international cooperation increases.

Finally, we return to the findings underlying Figure 3. From Figure 3, we concluded that the
corresponding authorship part in output resulting from international scientific cooperation was
relatively small, as compared to the overall output resulting from international scientific
cooperation. This brings us the results as shown in Figure 6, in which we present the
development of the numbers of publications in which the Dutch are not corresponding
authors. That is, these publications are actually somewhat out of the reach of the Dutch OA
mandate, as the OA status of these publications is not determined by Dutch academics, but by
either non-academics from the Netherlands (in the case of national scientific cooperation)
where OA is not such an issue as it has become for the university sector, or by foreign
colleagues (in the case of international scientific cooperation), for which completely different
OA mandates might apply. When we take a somewhat closer look to the two types of
scientific cooperation, we note that the number of publications that are national cooperation
based is stable at about 2000 publications. However, the output that results from international
scientific cooperation, in which Dutch academics participate but are not corresponding
authors, increases from 8290 in 2009 to 15053 in 2016, an increase of 6763 publications that
do not fall under the Dutch OA Mandate.

Conclusion & Discussion
A very first remark we can make on the basis of this study is related to the question what
makes a research paper a national product, so what makes it a Dutch, a German, or a Danish
paper ? This is becoming more and more an issue in conducting bibliometric analyses, as
international scientific cooperation intensifies, and as such is becoming more and more a
dominant aspect in science, and particular in Europe, with its research funding instruments
that incentivize international scientific collaboration, through requirements connected to
funding opportunities.
One first conclusion might be that the Dutch OA mandate could deal with a substantial
smaller part of the total production of the Netherlands and its universities as compared to the
perception that we have to take care of the total and also growing output of the Netherlands.
National ambition can thus be limited to a smaller number of publications as conceived
before, which also means that costs might be lower. However, that might make the discussion
with respect to the change from subscription based to APC based somewhat more
complicated, as Dutch academics still want to maintain their access to all the journals they
have access to now.
Next conclusion could be that given the growing output resulting from international scientific
cooperation, the part of the Dutch scientific output on which the mandate applies becomes
smaller. This is contrary to the wish by the Dutch government to have all Dutch outputs OA
accessible by 2010 (limited, as stated in the Introduction, to certain types of publication).
The study has shown that policies on national mandates can be hindered by international
polices related to research funding and scientific cooperation and integration. An advantage
can be that the goals set by national OA mandates can be more restricted to a smaller set of
publications, for example by looking at the part of the output in which corresponding
authorships play a role. This will however also further complicate the monitoring of OA
format publishing on the national level, not to mention on the international level.
However, one could also turn around the argumentation: if the Netherlands reaches under its
national OA mandate only a sub-set of the national scientific production, by taking
responsibility for the corresponding authorship segment of the total national production, and
every country would follow a similar policy, this creates a clear key for distributing
responsibilities with respect to getting national outputs accessible via OA publishing.
