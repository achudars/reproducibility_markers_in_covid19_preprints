Childcare costs and accessibility remain
barriers to women’s full labor force
participation
Since the 1970s, American women have moved
into higher education and the workforce en masse.
Yet, unequal responsibilities for child-rearing and
lack of access to affordable childcare remain
barriers to women’s full employment.i As
childcare costs increase, mothers are more likely
to leave the labor force, leaving them financially
dependent on their partners or family and
vulnerable to poverty.ii Our research shows that
childcare cost and quality, Head Start enrollment
rates and school day length are important policy
avenues to support working mothers.iii
Programs implemented in three states stand out as
providing support for working mothers: Nebraska,
North Dakota, and the District of Columbia.
• Nebraska provides inexpensive highquality childcareiv and longer school days. v
• Washington, D.C. provides universal
access to preschool for three- and fouryear oldsvi.
• North Dakota provides expansive Head
Start enrollmentvii.
Nebraska: Inexpensive Childcare and Long
School Days
Nebraska is notable in our studies for offering
parents inexpensive and high-quality childcare.
Many mothers return to work quickly following
childbirth, putting infants and toddlers into

childcare. Nebraska also has some of the longest
school days in the nation and widely available
afterschool care programsviii.
Nebraska has implemented the Step up to Quality
program through the Nebraska Department of
Education that is a quality rating and
improvement program that is open to all
providers: home/family based, public school
based, Head Start programs and childcare centers.
The program supports licensed childcare
providers to improve quality across seven metrics:
curriculum, learning environments, teacher-child
interactions, child outcomes, professional
development rating, family engagement and
partnership and program administration. Childcare
programs can choose to be evaluated for quality
across any of these seven metrics with points
allocated in each to indicate childcare quality.
Nebraska’s childcare policies are notable in their
inclusiveness and flexibility. Nebraska also has
some of the lowest poverty rates for married
couples in the nation.

Washington, D.C.: Universal Preschool Coverage
Washington, D.C. provides a model for preschool
policies. Like comparable cities, fee-based
childcare in the area remains expensive. Yet, the
District of Columbia leads the nation in expanding
access to pre-school programs. Roughly 70% of
all eligible three and four year-olds are now
enrolled in state-supported pre-school.
Universal preschool has benefited children from
disadvantaged families the most, offering
expanded access to developmental programs and

improving school readiness. It also significantly
boosted the employment and earnings of mothers
in Washington, D.C. Since the universal preschool
program was enacted, mothers’ labor force
participation increased by 12 percentage points,
with 10 percentage points attributable to the
expanded access of universal preschool. ix

higher concentration of childcare
workers relative to the national
average (location quotient)
b. Married mothers in these states are
more likely to be employed – fulltime and part-time – especially
when children are young

North Dakota: Head Start Enrollment
North Dakota has the highest rate of Head Start
enrollment in the nation. Among those eligible,
97% of three year-olds and 100% of four yearolds are enrolled in the program and many higher
income families are on waitlists for Head Start
programs given their high quality.x North
Dakota’s Head Start programs are notable for
their two-generation approach whereby they target
their marketing to the parents, to clarify the
benefits of a high quality preschool experience for
children’s long-term outcomes. North Dakota’s
Head Start programs are well-connected to the
local community and is embedded within other
federal programs (WIC and Department of
Workforce Services). Through these partnerships,
Head Start and the Childcare Assistance Program
are included in parents’ support plans to
encourage employment. North Dakota’s Head
Start program is notable for its strong alliances
with the community and existing government
support services.

Expanding childcare resources increases
maternal employment
Our research shows:
1. States tend to cluster in offering childcare
resources – states like Nebraska, Iowa,
North and South Dakota –provide
inexpensive childcare, long school days,
expansive afterschool care, and high
enrollment in Head Start programs
a.

These states tend to have higher
purchasing power, more femaledominated employment and a

2. Head Start enrollment helps high-school
educated mothers maintain employment
when faced with expensive childcare costs
a. The cost of childcare is especially
burdensome for mothers with a
high-school diploma or less who
tend to cluster in low-paid, service
jobs and may be priced out of care
b. The cost of childcare is mitigated,
in part, by states with high Head
Start enrollment and childcare
subsidies
Key policy recommendations (for state and/or
Federal U.S. governments):
1. Legislate guaranteed spaces in universal,
high quality, low-cost childcare
2. Lengthen school days
3. Expand after-school care
4. Maximize spaces for Head Start
enrollment
