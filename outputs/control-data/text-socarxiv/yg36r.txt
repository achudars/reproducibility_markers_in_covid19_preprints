Abstract After correcting for email usage prevalence and other experimental control variables, we
found that all country-level correlations originally reported in Cohn et al. vanished. No conclusions
can be drawn on cross-country differences in the rates of reporting lost wallets.
Field behavioral studies in humans have been complicated by difficulties in controlling for
unobserved variables (1). Although the main aim was to quantify the effect of money incentives on
wallet return rate, Cohn et al. (2) also reported a drastic variation in email responding rate among
countries, and interpreted them as “objective measurements” of civic honesty. They then claimed that
various geographic, cultural, and institutional variables of different countries (2) can explain 65% of
the variation in the adjusted email responding rate (their Fig S6).
Email usage reported by companies was cited to correct for the response rates in 27 nations,
excluding most western European countries (2). There is, however, no expectation on how email
usage by enterprises should correlate with individual telecommunication habits. We instead compiled
email usage frequency data among ordinary internet users from publicly available datasets for 36
countries (Table S1). We only analyzed Money and NoMoney conditions given their complete
country coverage. The email usage weighted by internet prevalence explained 71% of the variance in
observed email response rate in the NoMoney treatment and 67% in the Money treatment (Fig. S1). In
addition, we also found response rate to significant correlate with crime index (Fig. S2),
communication accuracy (Fig. S3-5) and population density of sampled cities (Fig. S6).
Principal component (PC) analysis of all independent variables revealed that many countrylevel variables are strongly loaded on PC1, where weighted email usage has the highest share of
loading (Fig. S7), suggesting that country-level variables were confounded by email usage. PC1 alone
can explain 75.24% of the variation in response rate. After removing the effects of weighted email
usage (Fig. S9), or together with 26 other control variables from the country-level variables by linear
regression (Fig. S8), none of their residuals significantly correlate with response rate after false
discovery rate correction. We present a corrected Fig. 1 with email response residuals, with the
emphasis that the country rankings were unexplained by statistically meaningful factors.
Other caveats that we have not accounted for here includes pseudoreplication of countries of
shared cultural history, akin to the non-independency problem in phylogenetic comparisons (3), which
results in over-confidence of significant tests, if any.
Our analyses confirm that money incentives increase email response rate, but cross-country
differences were mainly driven by spurious correlations unrelated to civic honesty.

Supplementary Information
Compilation of Email and internet usage data
We searched internet databases and webpages for email usage frequencies, resulted from
surveys of internet users or compiled by government agencies. We prioritize on statistics reported for
2015, and used the closest date to 2015 if that year is not available. If multiple statistics are stratified
by, for example, age or sex, we took the average number. Together we obtained email usage statistics
for 36 countries (Table S1; Supplementary data).
We downloaded global internet prevalence data from the International Telecommunication
Union website for the year 2015. In cases where email usage on computer and mobile devices were
available, we took the computer estimate. In datasets with indication of how often users email, we
summed the proportion of users that used emails at least once per month. We emphasize that while the
absolute proportions may be higher in the sampled cities due to the fact that they are the most
developed part of the countries, these numbers should provide a good approximation on the relative
tendency for locals to use email communication. The weighted email usage is computed by
multiplying the email usage frequency by the internet prevalence in each country.
Approximating communication accuracy
A commonly encountered issue of cross-cultural studies is the language barrier, among other
cultural differences. English was chosen as the language for instruction in this study, regardless of
countries and their native language. When the test subject failed to understand English, the research
assistant depended on a translation app to communicate. In this dataset for example, Chinese subjects
were subjectively scored by the research assistants to have a level of understanding matching the
Germans, with completely overlapping distributions. Counterintuitively, while >90% of the German
subjects understood English, the research assistants used a translation app to talk to more than 50% of
the Chinese subjects (Fig. S4A). A similar pattern (Fig. S4B) was found between Indonesia and
Switzerland (among other European countries). Unless one assumes the translator app performed
equally well as human, the explanation can only be that research assistants were overconfident on the
level of understanding by the subjects in a different culture. We examined translation results of three
commonly used apps on the phrase “Can you please take care of it”. Two (google translate, Microsoft
Bing) out of three translators gave the translation in Chinese equivalent to “Can you look after it”,
meaning that the subject should only keep the wallet safe but not take other actions. Translation errors
or ambiguities may explain why subjects did not actively seek owners.
To statistically account for different accuracies in translation and difficulties in
communication in English, we computed a composite score as an approximation. First, we use a
previously published language translator accuracy matrix for Google Translate (1), and averaged the
accuracies (standardized to the range 0-1) for translating to and from English. For test subjects who
communicated directly using English during the interaction with researchers, we also account for their
English ability by using nation-wide TOEFL scores standardized to the range 0-1, published by ETS.
Countries with English as the official language are coded with a standardized TOEFL score of 1. The
final composite score, which we call “Communication Accuracy”, is computed as EnglishSpeaker *
TOEFL + NonEnglishSpeaker * TranslatorAccuracy.
We found that in the deposited data file, “no_english” was incorrectly coded as “1” for India
and Kenya, whose official language included English. We corrected them to “0” for subsequent
analyses, following Cohn et al.’s definition.
Communication accuracy was positively correlated with response rate, explaining 15.9% of
the variance in the NoMoney treatment and 21.0% in the Money treatment (Fig. S5; Fig. S7).

Crime index
One possible explanation for subjects to not respond is that they have more experience with
scams, typical of countries with more crimes, making it more difficult to persuade subjects of the
genuineness of the research assistant. This hypothesis is not far-fetched, because one research
assistant was arrested by the police in Kenya due to suspicious activities. We downloaded Crime
index in 2015 from https://www.numbeo.com/crime/rankings_by_country.jsp?title=2015 for
correlations. As expected, the crime index is negatively correlated with response rate (Fig. S2; Fig.
S7). We note that this variable was not considered as a control variable.
Population density
Cohn et al. observed how busy the subject was for a short period. This should have been an
important control variable, because one expects that a more busy subject would be less likely to return
an email. It is surprising to find, however, that busy rating was instead positively correlated with email
response rate (Fig. S7).
We instead hypothesize that how busy a person is should correlate with local population density,
and may influence the response rate because employees would have less time dealing with nonbusiness requests.
We compiled population density data from the English version of Wikipedia, which in turn cited
data from respective governmental sources. When data were available for different areas of a
metropolitan area, only the density in the more central urban region was used because there is a large
variation on the suburban regions different cities administer. When we cannot determine whether the
data referred to the urban or the greater metropolitan area, we excluded them. Because the raw dataset
in excel format deposited by Cohn et al. contained only numeric city codes, without referring to the
actual city names, we were unable to associate the city names in the supplementary information to the
excel table. However, because the sampling appeared to be quite even between different cities within
a country, we simply averaged the population densities for all sampled cities in a country.
We indeed see a negative correlation with log population density with email response rate (Fig.
S6), as expected if it is a proxy for how busy people are. We consider it to be a control variable.
Principal component analysis
Due to the very high number of independent variables (including control variables and candidate
country-level variables) in the dataset, it is necessary to remove their self-correlations prior to
subsequent analysis, to avoid problems caused by multicollinearity during linear regressions (2). Due
to extensive missing data, the variable “r_PL_propertylaw” was excluded from the matrix. The
following variables contained sporadic missing data: "security_cam", "security_guard",
"c_WVS_familyties", "c_GPLS_judicial_independence", "c_GPLS_constitutional_review",
"c_GPLS_plurality" and "c_GPLS_prop_representation". In order to maximize usable data, we
imputed the missing values with the missingMDA R package, using all other independent variables
(but not response rate) as predictors.
The optimal number of PCs were then estimated on the matrix with missing data using the
estim_ncpPCA R function using the kfold approach, with a maximal number of PCs set to 30. This
procedure identified 18 PCs to be sufficient to describe all independent variables. The PCA was
performed using the data matrix with imputed cells, with the component number set to 18. We then
used a model selection approach to identify which PCs significantly correlated with email response
rates.

For model selection, we use a stepwise variable addition/elimination approach, implemented in
the R step() function, using the Akaike information criterion (3) (AIC) during each iteration to
determine the most parsimonious model that yields the lowest AIC. The addition/elimination steps
were run in both the direction of increasing and decreasing model complexity (direction=”both”),
starting from the simplest model including only the intercept. Only main effects were examined. We
note that the model choice was robust to the choice of the starting model and the direction of iteration.
This procedure yielded an optimal model containing 14 out of the 18 PCs, explaining 89.35% of
the variation in email response rate. Among these, PC1 explains 75.24% while PC12 explains 3.83%.
The rest of the PCs only explain a small proportion of the variation. We visualize the variable
loadings onto each PC, and found that money condition uniquely loaded onto PC12, suggesting that
this variable is unlikely to be confounded by other effects (Fig. S6). However, weighted email usage
most heavily loaded onto PC1, where many other country-level variables also have significant
loadings, suggesting that their correlations were confounded by email usage (Fig. S6).
We next removed the influence of situational and experimental variables (control variables,
bolded in Fig. S6) from the candidate country-level variables. First, we performed PCA on all control
variables and correlated all PCs with email response rate. Significant PCs (p<0.05) were used to
perform linear regressions with the country-level variables. By taking the residuals from these
regressions, we effectively remove any spurious correlations caused by weighted email usage and
other idiosyncratic experimental conditions. None of the residuals correlated with email response rate
after FDR correction (Fig. S7) any longer.
Even when we only corrected for weighted email usage, no country-level variables significantly
correlated with email response rate after FDR correction (Fig. S8).
We produced a new Fig. 1showing the residual email response rates corrected for all control
variables, using the same methods outlined above. A prominent feature of this figure is a random
distribution of developed and developing nations and a narrower spread of data.

response rate through their correlation with the weighted email usage.
