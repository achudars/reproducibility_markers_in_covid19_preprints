1. Introduction

This paper refines the subgroupings of the
Timor-Alor-Pantar (TAP) family of Papuan
languages, using a systematic Bayesian phylogenetics study. While recent work indicates that the TAP family comprises a Timor
(T) branch and an Alor Pantar (AP) branch
(Holton et al. 2012, Schapper et al. 2017),
the internal structure of the AP branch has
proven to be a challenging issue, and earlier
studies leave large gaps in our understanding. Our Bayesian inference study is based
on an extensive set of TAP lexical data from
the online LexiRumah database (Kaiping &
Klamer 2018). Systematically testing different approaches to cognate coding, loan exclusion, and explicit modelling choices, we
arrive at a subgrouping structure of the TAP
family that is based on features of the phylogenies shared across the different analyses.
Our TAP tree differs from all earlier proposals by inferring the East-Alor subgroup as an
early split-off from all other AP languages,
instead of the most deeply embedded subgroup inside that branch.

The Timor-Alor-Pantar (TAP) languages are
a family of some 25 non-Austronesian or
“Papuan” languages spoken on the islands
of Timor, Alor and Pantar, as well as on
neighbouring smaller islets, located some
1,000 kilometres west of New Guinea (Holton
et al. 2012, Schapper et al. 2017, Holton &
Robinson 2017, Klamer 2017). The TAP family is split into three branches: Bunak, the
East Timor group comprising the languages
Makasae, Fataluku, and Oirata, and the AlorPantar (AP) branch, which comprises the remaining languages. For an alphabetical list
of the TAP languages and their locations, see
Table 1 and Fig. 1 on the next pages.
Makasae, Fataluku, and Bunak are spoken on the island of Timor, the language
Oirata is spoken on the neighboring island of

Most of the TAP languages have speaker
communities ranging between 1 000 and
10 000 speakers. The average number of
speakers per language is 11 852 due to the
three big languages Bunak (80 000 speakers),
Fataluku (30 000), and Makasae (70 000), spoken on Timor. One of the smallest languages
is Klamu (200 speakers) (Holton 2004), see Table 1.
The relatively small size of most of these
speaker communities and the limited geographical area in which they live has resulted
in a situation where traditionally neighbouring groups had much contact through cultural exchanges and intermarriage. Contact with Austronesian donor languages goes
back a long way, as evidenced by the Austronesian loans that were borrowed into the
AP proto-language before it split up, perhaps 3000 years ago (see Section 2.5; Holton
et al. (2012)). The contact between TAP
and Austronesian languages continues until today and has resulted in Austronesian
loan words in the individual TAP languages.
Three recent donor languages of Austronesian loan words are Indonesian, the dominant national language of Indonesia and/or
its basilect Alor Malay, Alorese, the lingua
franca used on (parts of) Pantar and West
Alor before the advent of Malay/Indonesian,
and Tetun, one of the national languages of
Timor Leste.
Over the last 15 years, a body of work
on TAP languages has appeared, including
grammatical descriptions, typological comparisons and historical comparative work.
Historical reconstructions used the traditional comparative method based on regular
sound changes, first demonstrating the existence of an Alor Pantar group (Holton et al.
2012) and an East Timor group (Schapper et
al. 2012), followed by a demonstration that

both groups together form the TAP family
(Schapper et al. 2017).
If and how the TAP family relates to other
families is examined by Holton & Robinson
(2014) who conclude that there is no lexical evidence to support an affiliation with
any other family in the world, including the
Trans New Guinea family, in contrast to what
had been assumed previously (Wurm et al.
1975, Ross 2005).
Robinson & Holton (2012) compare the
tree of Holton et al. (2012), shown in Fig. 2,
with a Bayesian phylogenetic inference tree,
shown in Fig. 3. Both of these trees were created using data collected up to 2009.
Over the last few years much additional
comparative lexical data has been collected
on the TAP languages, increasing the size
of the sample from 12 to 40 TAP language
varieties (i.e. dialects or languages). The
new word lists have been combined with the
earlier body of data and made available in
the LexiRumah database (Kaiping et al. 2019,
Kaiping & Klamer 2018). On the methodological side, recent years have seen a significant
improvement of computational tools, models
and algorithms for inferring language histories from word lists. For example, there are
now new methods for automatic cognate detection using state-of-the-art pairwise phonetic alignment algorithms (List 2012a,b, List
& Greenhill & Tresoldi, et al. 2018, List et
al. 2017, Jäger et al. 2017) that reach nearly
90% accuracy (B-Cubed F-score) in determining the cognate sets to be used in phylogenetic analyses (Rama et al. 2018). Bayesian
phylogenetic inference research has empirically shown which models are useful for lexical data (Chang et al. 2015, Kolipakam et
al. 2018) and many of these models have
been made accessible (Maurits et al. 2017)
for easy use with linguistic data that is conforming to cross-linguistic standards (Forkel
2017, Forkel & List, et al. 2018). In addi-

archical fashion, sound changes ofen cross-cut each other in a wave-like pattern
that is not well-described by a tree. Tis is the case in the history of the AlorPantar languages. While it is possible to identify many phonological innovations
in the history of Alor-Pantar, only two of those innovations occur in the same
subset of languages (*g > ʔ and *k > Ø / _#, both in Blagar and Adang). Each
of the other phonological innovations delineates a distinct subset of languages.

H2012 use a subset of these changes to delineate four subgroups within the
Alor-Pantar family (see Fig. 4). An Alor subgroup is deﬁned by the merger of
*k and *q. Within the Alor subgroup, a West Alor subgroup is deﬁned by the
change *s > h, and an East Alor subgroup is deﬁned by the two changes *b >
p and *s > t. Te former change is also shared with Kamang (Km); the latter
with Abui (Ab). So while it is tempting to expand this group, only Sawila (Sw)
and Wersing (We) share both of these innovations, deﬁning the subgroup we
refer to as East Alor. Finally, within West Alor, a Straits subgroup is deﬁned by

Te fact that the Bayesian tree has high clade credibility values should not be
interpreted as evidence that it is somehow the “right” or “correct” tree. Rather,
the conclusion to be drawn is that additional searching is unlikely to reveal a tree
which better ﬁts our data. With this caution, we can compare the Bayesian tree
to the split graph (Fig. 5). To a large extent the groupings in the Bayesian tree are
compatible with those in the split graph. First, Sawila (Sw) and Wersing (We) are
shown to be closely related, a grouping which was also present in the classiﬁcation
yielded similar results. In contrast to Dunn et al. (2011) we found a strict unidirectional model
actually performed slightly better than the gamma covarion model (though still not as well as
the Dollo model).

tion, a number of new models have been suggested that might better match how lexical
replacement takes place in reality (Bouckaert & Robbeets 2017, Kelly & Nicholls 2016).
The earlier reconstructions of the TAP
family still leave large gaps in our understanding of the linguistic history of the TAP
family, especially in its subgrouping. Applying the traditional comparative method in
subgrouping is inherently subjective (we explain this in Section 4), and is widely recognized as a fraught task, especially for closely
related languages. In this paper we readdress the subgrouping of the TAP family,
with a particular focus on the internal structure of the AP subfamily, while making all
the analytical steps involved as visible and
explicit as possible. We reduce the subjectiveness of the subgrouping task by applying
recently developed computational tools and
models. Our data is the now extensive lexical dataset of TAP languages that is publicly
available in LexiRumah. We focus on the lexicon as a data type that is quantitatively wellunderstood and for which models of evolution exist.
These computational models of lexical
evolution currently rely on cognate-coded
word list data. Each language variety is represented by its forms (words) that best represent a list of pre-defined meanings or concepts. Forms are grouped in cognate classes
according to common origin. An example for
a list with the four given concepts ‘arm’, ‘arrow’, ‘bamboo’, and ‘to blaze; to shine’ in two
language varieties can be found in Table 2.
For this article, we use state-of-the-art
automatic cognate detection algorithms to
approximate the incremental process of selecting cognate sets and identifying regular
sound changes, see Section 2.2. We systematically exclude loan words from our data
set at various different levels, using different
quantitative methods of loan exclusion, and
we compare the results of each method.

The weighting of the subgrouping evidence is done through explicit, stochastic
models for the evolution of the lexicon. At
their core, these models assume that a meaning keeps being expressed by words derived
from a particular root for some time, but that
a stochastic process removes existing associations between meanings and roots and creates new associations. In order to be computationally tractable, the models make different assumptions about the independence
of the stochastic processes. For example,
they generally assume that the words expressing different concepts evolve independently, which is a reasonable assumption for
forms with separate meanings (eg. ‘to sit’
and ‘sacrifice’), but a necessary simplification for forms that express semantically similar meanings (eg. ‘to sit’ and ’to dwell’). We
explicitly compare several different state-ofthe-art models that have been suggested for
language evolution in the Bayesian phylogenetics literature.

ogy used in our study: we discuss the underlying data set in Section 2.1, the automatic
cognate coding method in Section 2.2, and
our strategy for dealing with borrowed lexical items in Section 2.3. We then deal with
the inference procedure, describing the evolutionary model in Section 2.4, the shape of
the tree (in terms of priors, clocks, and calibrations) in Section 2.5, and methods for our
Bayesian inference in Sections 2.4 and 2.6.
This is summarized in Section 2.7, where we
re-iterate the Base (B) model which we use
in this study, as well as the alternative modelling options we explore to check the robustness of our results. The alternative models involve different methods of coding Cognates (C1, C2, C3, C4), treating Loans (L1, L2),
different evolutionary Models (M1, ML), and
different Tree shapes (T1, T2, T5, T6) (see the
summary in Table 3).
We provide these results in Section 3, summarizing them in a tree that reflects the consensus between the different Bayesian posterior samples. In Section 4 we compare our
tree with previous work, including replication studies (R1, R2, MR) using comparable
data. Our tree differs from the earlier proposals in a number of ways. One difference
is that our tree does not confirm the first order split between a Timor and an Alor-Pantar
branch which was found in earlier studies,

All our parameter values and the implementations of our methods in unambiguous
computer algorithms are provided open for
inspection, and the robustness of all our results is investigated under several alternative models and/or parameter choices.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In
Section 2 we describe the data and methodol-

and instead has the languages spoken on
Timor attach to the TAP node with two different branches. We leave this difference for
future research. Instead, we focus on the internal structure of the AP branch, where we
find the position of the East-Alor subgroup as
an early split-off from all the other languages
in this branch. We discuss these differences
and address the question how they can be explained. In Section 5 we discuss our results
and check the reliability of our automatically
generated tree structure by a qualitative inspection of the innovations that support the
early split off of the East-Alor group. Section 6 contains final remarks and a conclusion. Apart from filling in some extant gaps
about the internal structure of the TAP family, the paper aims to demonstrate how computational methods and tools can be consistently applied to infer the phylogenetics of a
group of languages, and, moreover, how they
can assist the linguist in making the fraught
task of subgrouping more objective and less
trying.

lutionary histories in the model, given the
cognate-coded data, must be calculated. In
the following subsections we discuss each of
these steps.
The results of a Bayesian inference is a
posterior probability distribution of trees often characterized by a DensiTree visualization of trees (Bouckaert 2010, Bouckaert &
Heled 2014) sampled from the distribution,
or by a consensus tree summarizing properties of the trees in the distribution.
For example, Fig. 4 shows the probability distribution corresponding to “80% certainty that language A and language B are
more closely related to each other than to
language C, and no other information” (cf.
Fig. 4a), and visualizes it using DensiTree
(Fig. 4b) and a maximum clade credibility
summary tree (Fig. 4c). All prior knowledge and all results of Bayesian phylogenetics are in principle such quantitative certainty statements, generated as a long sequence of trees, each with frequency according to its certainty (Fig. 4d).

2.1. Data
As mentioned above, the data for this study
is taken from the open-access LexiRumah
database (Kaiping & Klamer 2018). The most
recent version v2.1.2 (Kaiping et al. 2019) of
the database contains 128 language varieties
(or “lects”), 40 of which are extant TimorAlor-Pantar languages and 3 comparative
reconstructions of TAP proto-languages,
namely proto-Timor-Alor-Pantar, protoAlor-Pantar and proto-East Timor-Bunak.
The forms of the proto-languages are not
independent of the other data points (because some of them have been used in the
reconstruction procedure), so we did not
include them in our analyses. The remaining
40 word lists of TAP languages have been
aggregated from various recent sources

2. Data and Methods
Running a Bayesian phylogenetic inference
procedure on lexical data has the following
requirements: (1) The lexical data must be
in a comparable format (phonetic or phonemic), with clean meaning-form mappings,
and (2) coded for cognacy; (3) loan words
must be handled such that the phylogenetic
signal is not dominated by the contact signal
of the borrowings; (4) a computational model
of lexical evolution must be specified; and (5)
the posterior probability of the possible evo-

and are not all equally long. Originally,
their sources may have used different
glossing conventions, but LexiRumah
provides manually normalized Concepticon mappings (List et al. 2016) for all its
concepts. In this way, meanings that are
glossed differently across different sources
(e. g. the forms glossed as ‘saya’ by Keraf
(1978) and as ‘I’ in Blust (1999)) are linked
to the same underlying concept (in this case
‘1sg;
https://concepticon.clld.org/
parameters/1209’). Each lexeme in the
database is presented with a transcription as
supplied by the original source, and a normalized, segmented phonetic transcription
in IPA (using diacritics only in those cases
where that level of detail is available in the
original source).
Some words occur in sets that are highly
correlated in shape. For example, in a language with a decimal numeral system, the
number words above ‘ten’ will typically have
forms reflecting the morpheme for ‘ten’; and
when the form for ‘ten’ has been replaced in
a language (by e. g. a borrowing), it is very
likely that the forms for ‘twenty’, ‘thirty’,
etc., or the forms for ‘nineteen’, ‘eighteen’,
etc., also change. So we excluded the 25
decimally composite numeral concepts from
our word lists. Some but not all of the TAP
languages have quinary numeral systems, so
that the numbers ‘six’ to ‘ten’ are multimorphemic in some languages but not in others. Therefore we kept the numeral concepts
up to ‘ten’ throughout.
After removing 25 numeral concepts, each
TAP lect in our data is attested through
a word list containing between 99 (AbuiPetleng variety) and 576 (Makasae) forms
spanning 597 concepts. The mean number
of forms for each TAP word lists is 461, representing on average 408 different concepts,
placing the average synonym count at 1.128
forms per concept. Apart from the very short

bootstrap step) to transform one form into
the other, normalized by the chance for random similarities and the length of the forms.
The network of pairwise cognate-ness distances is clustered into disjoint cognate
classes using the infomap graph community structure detection algorithm (Rosvall
& Bergstrom 2008). This method has been
shown to outperform other methods (List et
al. 2017). We follow List et al. and transform the weighted graph into an unweighted
graph by connecting exactly those pairs of
forms that have a cognate-ness distance less
than than a threshold θ.
In general, we use the threshold of θ =
0.55 that performed best in List et al.’s analy-

sis. However, for comparison we also present
results generated from a threshold based on
an approach that is more “splitting” (C1: θ =
0.35) and more “lumping” (C2: θ = 0.75).
In Fig. 6, we show the same underlying data
as in Fig. 5, but transformed into a nonweighted graph using those different threshold values. The resulting cognate classes are
reproduced in Table 3. Note that in Fig. 5, the
four forms in different dialects of Bunak (left,
dark blue) are grouped together in a single
cognate class. With a threshold of θ = 0.35
(Fig. 6a), this class is split in two, whereas for
θ = 0.75 (Fig. 6b) the Kula and Klon forms
are grouped together with the Bunak forms.
An alternative to LexStat is the Online
PMI method published by Rama et al. (2017).
Where LexStat uses three passes over the
whole dataset to find sound correspondences
in the data and how systematic they are,
the Online PMI method updates its similarity scores contiuously (‘online’ in the machine learning jargon) by going through the
dataset in small batches and adapting the
scores used for future alignments after each
such batch. It uses a statistical measure for
the co-occurence of sound segments known
as ‘Pointwise Mutual Information’ to generate these scores.
OnlinePMI performed better than LexStat
in identifying cognate classes (Rama et al.
2017), but it gave worse results when reconstructing trees using Bayesian phylogenetics on the bases of these classes (Rama
et al. 2018).2 Compared to LexStat, the Online PMI method is better able to handle data
with lower mutual coverage. This comes at

It is not particularly surprising that an algorithm
may perform better in one of these tasks, but worse
in the other task. The measure used for assessing the quality of cognate coding may, for example,
barely punish a small systematic bias in the cognate classes, which however is important when using these classes to reconstruct trees

the cost of a significant random component,
making it harder to optimize OnlinePMI for
a particular application.
Due to these advantages and disadvantages, we chose LexStat as our Baseline
method, but included Online PMI for a comparative investigation (C3). In that analysis we cognate code out data using Online PMI, with parameters α = 0.75,
initial cutoff c = 0.5 and batch size
m = 256. We use the implementation available from https://github.com/
evolaemp/online_cognacy_ident in the
version from commit 3b998ae.

2.3. Lexical borrowing
As mentioned above, the history of the
Timor-Alor-Pantar languages is strongly influenced by language contact, and multilinguality is usual in the region (Klamer 2017,
Holton & Klamer 2017). At present, standard
Indonesian and local Malay have a strong influence on the vocabulary of all the TAP languages, and Tetun has influenced those spoken in Timor Leste.
Some studies have argued that the results
of phylogenetic analyses will be reasonably
accurate even if 15% of the vocabulary constitute undetected loanwords Greenhill et al.
(2009), Chang et al. (2015). Tree models can
by their nature not encompass borrowing,
so that undetected loans and chance resemblances in the data are problematic for them.
Therefore, some studies exclude loans by
representing a loan word that is connected
to a specific meaning as a ’missing’ or ’unknown’ form. However, as Chang et al. (2015)
point out, loans represent one case of exactly the type of lexical replacement that
the phylogenetic inference models purport
to model, so it would be ill-advised to treat
them as missing or unknown data when applying such models.

All languages, however, have loans that result from borrowing events that occurred so
recently that the loans entered the languages
as independent events, i.e. they were not inherited from the ancestor language. For example, most languages in LexiRumah express
the concept ‘church’, a concept which became widely known in the region only in the
last 300 years, with forms like [geredʒa] or
[igredʒa], which are obvious recent Indonesian viz. Portuguese loans. Such recent loans
do not carry a phylogenetic signal. Yet, the
presence of a similar word makes the donor
language and all the recipient languages appear closer to each other than their actual genealogical relationship would suggest.
Therefore, it makes sense to treat each of
these recently borrowed forms as an isolate
cognate class, distinct from each other and
any other cognate class in the data. In our
binary model of cognate evolution (see Section 2.4), in which each pair of a cognate class
and a meaning is coded separately as either
present or absent, this is functionally equivalent to only providing presence/absence features for non-loanword cognate classes, and
coding all cognate classes for a concept expressed using a recent loan as “absent”. We
do this as follows.
LexiRumah contains word lists for Indonesian and different Tetun varieties. Indonesian and the locally used variety of Malay
are lexically very similar, and both are the
source for the majority of recent loans in the
TAP languages (Klamer 2017: 11-12). In order to exclude recent loans from our dataset,
we therefore set all cognate classes to be “absent” if a form appears to be in the same cognate class as an Indonesian or Tetun form.
To test the robustness of our trees against
other possible treatments of loans, we then
compare the results of baseline inference under loan exclusion (B) with an inference under inclusion of all forms, including those

We also compare our baseline inference
B with another inference (L2) where we exclude even more potential loans by removing all the forms from the data that express
“highly borrowable” concepts. Taking the
threshold from Gray et al. (2009), we exclude
all concepts with a borrowed score of more
than 0.15 according to Haspelmath & Tadmor (2009). Table 4 shows a list of concepts we excluded for analysis L2 because
they closely match a concept in WoLD with
a borrowed score of 0.15 or more, the full list
is in appendix B.

2.4. Model of language
evolution
The basic principle of Bayesian phylogenetic
inference is the application of Bayes’ Theorem
P (Tree | Data) =

P (Data | Tree) · P (Tree)
P (Data)
(1)

to calculate a posterior probability distribution over all possible language trees. Trees
have a higher posterior probability when
they are more compatible with either (i) the
data (that is, trees with a higher likelihood
P (Data | Tree)) or (ii) our knowledge about
how language phyologies look in general
(that is, trees with a higher prior probability
P (Tree)). We therefore need to (i) assume a
stochastic model that describes the evolution
of cognate classes on any given tree and (ii)
specify our prior knowledge about the shape
of the Timor-Alor-Pantar tree.
Evolutionary model The stochastic
model will be evaluated many millions of
times, so it needs to be computationally very
simple, while still reflecting the evolution of
cognate classes as well as possible. From a

linguistic perspective, we might expect that
ideally, a cognate class for a particular meaning should come into existence only once in
history, and every attested instance of such
a cognate class should be explainable as derived from that single origin through inheritance or borrowing. In the phylogenetics literature, this is known as the Dollo assumption (after Dollo (1893)).
In linguistic reality, however, this idealisation does not hold. In addition to chance similarities and borrowings, as discussed above,
there are universal patterns in lexical semantics (List & Greenhill & Anderson, et al.
2018, Zalizniak 2018) and universal tendencies in how forms change their lexical semantics over time (Traugott & Dasher 2002,
Heine & Kuteva 2005). As a result, it is possible to find formally related words filling one
and the same meaning slot in different languages, even though their most recent common ancestor may have used an unrelated
form for that meaning. This effect is known
as homoplasy in biology (Jäger & List 2018).
Stochastic Dollo models are computationally intensive, because they cannot be computed for part of a tree independent of every
other part. Combining this with the effects
of imperfections in cognate coding and homoplasy implies that stochastic Dollo models cannot be usefully applied to lexical data
in most cases (but see Bowern & Atkinson
(2012), Kolipakam et al. (2018), Michael et al.
(2015) for cases where they can be applied).
Besides stochastic Dollo models, several
alternative models of cognate class evolution are used in studies of Bayesian phylogenetics. Studies comparing different models find that in most cases (Gray et al. 2009,
Lee & Hasegawa 2011, Kolipakam et al. 2018)
the best performing model is Binary covarion
(although sometimes, as in (Bowern & Atkinson 2012) it is found that Binary covarion
performs second-best after a Dollo model).

Figure 7: Possible transitions in the binary
covarion model of cognate evolution with their parameterized transition rates. Letters in brackets
mark the transitions discussed in
the text.

In the Binary covarion model, the presence
or absence of every cognate-class–meaning
pair is assumed to evolve independently. The
Binary covarion model allows the 8 transitions shown in Fig. 7, with rates parameterized as shown. A particular pair of a cognate class and a meaning may originally have
been present but be lost over time, or it was
originally absent but was innovated. Such
transitions between a cognate class-meaning
pair being present and absent are possible at
a very low (“cold”) rate, see transition A and
B in Fig. 7.
The hot/cold metaphor here comes from
models of physical processes, where increasing the temparature de-stabilizes a system (eg. melting, de-magnetizing); the
covarion model’s, “cold absent” and “cold
present” states are each very stable, whereas
transitions between “hot absent” and “hot

present” can be relatively fast and frequent.
A simplified example from our data to illustrate some of the transitions in Fig. 7
would be the following. The proto-TAP form
*lamV ’walk’ was inherited in proto-AP as
*lam(ar), and a modern reflex of it is Klon lam
’walk’. Teiwa also has a word lam, but it has
shifted its meaning to ’follow (a path/river)’,
and the word tewar is now the word used for
’walk’. Thus, the pair <*lam(ar)-’walk’> did
not undergo a transition in Klon, but it has
become absent in Teiwa, thus changing from
“cold present” to “cold absent”, cf. transition A in Fig. 7.
However, the model does not only account
for transitions between present and absent
at a very low rate; it also contains two transitory states: “hot present” and “hot absent”.
Applied to our example, the pair <*lam(ar)’walk’> would go from “cold present” to “hot
present” (Fig. 7, C) in a language when the
word is still in use but speakers also start to
use another word as an alternative or synonym for it. If over time, this synonym replaces the <*lam(ar)-’walk’> form, the latter
will fall into disuse and will only be known by
some (older) speakers as the archaic form for
’walk’. This change would illustrate a transition from “hot present” to “hot absent”
(Fig. 7, D). The next stage might be that the
word completely disappears, thus switching
to the “cold absent” state (Fig. 7, E). Transitions between the intermediate states of “hot
present” and “hot absent” are assumed to occur at a much higher rate than any of the
other transitions. So, the most likely path for
the loss of a cognate class does not go from
“present” to “absent” but from “present” to
“hot present” to “hot absent” to “absent”.
Similarly the most likely patch for an innovation would not be to simply go from “absent” to “present” but first to become “hot
absent” (e.g. an innovative word introduced
by a few speakers), then “hot present” (the

15

new word used in variation with the existing word), and then become “present”. In
the model, the switches between “hot” and
“cold” states can reflect different speeds of
evolution of cognate-class–meaning pairs in
different parts of the tree.
Because a model with transitions of different types and rates approaches linguistic reality more than simpler models that assume switches between present and absence
of cognate sets, we choose the Binary covarion model for our Baseline analysis (B), even
though it is still a highly abstract idealisation
of real language evolution.
The technical details are as follows. The
transition rates are chosen such that the
marginal probability to be in a “present”
state is π1 and the equilibrium probability for
“absent” is π0 = 1 − π1 . The vertical transition rates between hot and cold states are
balanced such that the system is expected to
be “hot” and “cold” each half of the time.
The switch rate s is inferred using a Γ prior
with parameters α = 0.05 and β = 10,
the slower rate α is distributed uniformly
between 10−4 and 1, and the underlying
present/absent frequencies π0 and π1 are inferred assuming a flat Dirichlet prior. Rates
are normalised to an expected 1 present/absent switch per time unit, and re-scaled with
the log-normally distributed clock rate, and a
Γ-distributed rate depending on the concept.
This Γ rate variation between concepts
reflects that not all concepts change forms
at equal speeds; instead, the replacement
speeds between different concepts vary
widely (Greenhill et al. 2010, 2017, Chang
et al. 2015).
In addition, we compare our Baseline analysis with an alternative analysis using the
recently developed pseudo-Dollo covarion
model (M1) (Bouckaert & Robbeets 2017) that
combines a relaxed Dollo assumption with
advantages of the Binary covarion model.

Because applying the Dollo model is expected
to be strongly influenced by undetected borrowings, we also perform another analysis
(ML) using the pseudo-Dollo covarion model
on a version of the dataset where we removed the highly borrowable concepts with
a borrowed score of more than 0.15 in WoLD
(Haspelmath & Tadmor 2009), like we did for
analysis L2 (see Section 2.3 and Table 4).

2.5. Tree prior, clocks and
calibrations
In addition to deciding on the evolutionary
model, we also need to specify our prior
knowledge of the TAP tree. One type of prior
knowledge involves the rate in which languages split from their immediate ancestor.
A uniform tree prior assumes that all the languages in the tree split at a constant rate, and
that the internal nodes of the tree have ages
that are uniformly distributed between the
tips and the root of the tree (i.e., that all our
subgroups are of the same age). The advantage of such a prior is that it is computationally very simple, but the disadvantage is that
it does not have any basis in how languages
evolve in reality (Barido-Sottani et al. 2018,
du Plessis 2018).
In biology, a well-established prior on
trees is the coalescent tree prior. It describes
the possible ancestries of two genes in a large
mixing population: Tracing the gene back in
the family tree of different individuals from
the population, when do the ancestries of the
gene coalesce to a single gene in a single ancestor? Due to the assumption of a large,
mixing population, this tree prior does not
appear particularly suited to our data.
A third type of tree prior is the Fossilised
Birth-Death (FBD) prior, which assumes that
languages split from their ancestor at a constant birth rate, and go extinct at a different,
but also constant death rate, while leaving

16

fossils behind to the present day with a low
chance. (This chance is 0 for our data, which
does not contain independent evidence for
historical languages.)
Rama (2018) has compared the uniform,
coalescent and FBD priors on Indo-European
data, and found that the the trees inferred
using the FBD prior and the uniform prior
both closely match the traditionally established Indo-European tree, while the coalescent prior performs much worse. Rama concludes that “any future phylogenetic experiment should test uniform tree prior as a baseline before testing more parameter-rich priors such as FBD or coalescent priors.” (Rama
2018). We therefore use the FBD prior tree
for our baseline inference B and compare it
with a uniform prior tree in analysis T1.
Our prior knowledge about the TAP tree
also contains information about the fact that
certain subgroups split, and about times
when that happened. While dating the nodes
in the tree is not our primary goal here, it
is known that including multiple calibration
dates in a tree can influence its topology, that
is, change its subgrouping. Since we are interested in the subgrouping of TAP, we investigate the effects of including calibration
dates on subgrouping in the TAP tree.
The migration of speakers of the ancestors of today’s Oirata speakers from east
Timor to the adjacent island of Kisar, i. e.
the date when Oirata split from its relatives Makasae/Makalero and Fataluku, can
be dated with high confidence to the year
1721 or shortly before that (Hägerdal 2012:
337). We therefore include a uniformly distributed calibration on the split that is directly ancestral to Oirata in all our inferences permitting the 6 years until 1721, i. e
the range 279–286 yBP.
Calibration dates for other splits in the
tree are based on circumstantial evidence
only, and thus should be taken with caution.

Consequently, we do include them in our
baseline analysis (B), which is intended to reflect our best knowledge, but run an inference using only the tree calibration on Oirata
for comparison (T2).
One observation that has been made is that
the level of lexical and grammatical similarity within the AP sub-branch does not support an age of more than several millennia
(Klamer 2017: 10). The reconstructed vocabulary of proto-AP appears to contain MalayoPolynesian (MP) loan words such as proto-AP
*baj ’pig’, cf. proto-MP *babuy; and protoAP *bui ’betelnut, cf. proto-MP *buaq ’fruit’
(Holton et al. 2012). These ancient MP loans
are found across the Alor-Pantar branch, and
they follow regular sound changes, which indicates that they were borrowed at the level
of proto-AP. We use them to approximately
date when proto-AP split from proto-TAP.
Proto MP has been dated at 4 000 years BP,
(Pawley 2002), and speakers of MP languages
are commonly assumed to have arrived in
the Timor Alor Pantar area around 3 000 BP
(Pawley 2005, Spriggs 2011). The MP borrowings in proto-AP would thus give the AP family a maximum age of around 3 000 years.
Human genetic studies support a connection between populations of the Lesser Sundas with Papuan populations of New Guinea
and Austronesian-Malayo-Polynesians from
Asia (Lansing et al. 2011, Xu et al. 2012). The
admixture between Papuan and (’Melanesian’-)Asian is estimated to have begun about
5 000 years BP in the western part of eastern Indonesia, decreasing to 3 000 years BP in
the eastern part. This associates the PapuanAsian admixture with Austronesian-MP expansion (Xu et al. 2012). This is the only
date range with quantitative confidence, and
gives the confidence interval used in our
analysis (given in the configuration file in
terms of the 90% confidence interval required by BEASTling).

17

The dating is consistent with the scarce
linguistic and archeological evidence for the
contact time frame around 3 000–3 500 BP, so
we assume that proto-Timor-Alor-Pantar existed as a single language definitely no later
than 3 000 yBP.
Unlike proto-AP, proto-TAP does not have
any reconstructible MP borrowings. There
are significant lexical and grammatical differences between the languages of the AP
branch and those of Timor (Holton et al.
(2012: 115) and references cited there), suggesting a long period of separation for the
branches. We estimate that proto-TAP was
spoken around 4 000 years ago (Bellwood
1997: 123, Ross 2005: 42, Pawley 2005).
In summary, our data does not contain
many calibration points. We therefore expect that we do not have sufficient data to
distinguish between a strict clock, which implies the same speed of evolution to be the
same throughout the whole tree, and a random clock, which allows the rate of evolution
to vary between different parts of the tree by
assigning a different relative rate of evolution to each branch in the tree.
In order to test this hypothesis, we infer
a tree with a strict clock as baseline (B), and
compare this with two further inference setups (T5, T6) which use a local random clock.
In these runs, we take the clock rates to
be Gamma distributed. Given the weak evidence from our calibrations, we expect the
tree prior to play a major role in these analyses, so we run one analysis (T5) using a BirthDeath prior (like B) and the other analysis
(T6) using a uniform tree prior (like T1).

ible with the data. There are, however,
680 425 371 729 975 800 390 different tree
topologies for our 40 TAP languages, and
only a very small proportion of these together have any relevant posterior probability. The number of trees is so immense that
even if the computation of a single posterior
probability took only a single operation on a
Gigahertz-computer, it would still take more
than 20 000 years to iterate through all trees
and find the best one.
In order to avoid this feasibility problem, we resort to the Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) sampling method and make
use of the fact that similar trees have somewhat similar probabilities. Instead of drawing trees entirely at random and calculating
the their probabilities (a process known as
Monte Carlo sampling), the MCMC sampling
method constructs a random walk through
the space of trees. It has a memory of one
previous state (which is the characteristic
property of a Markov chain) and uses small
random modifications, such as swapping two
subtrees, to explore the search space of all
trees in a more structured manner. If the
modification leads to a more probable tree,
the algorithm accepts it and takes it as its
new state. If the posterior probability of the
new state is worse than the posterior probability of the old state, there is still a chance
that the algorithm accepts it and moves to
it, otherwise it is rejected, and a different
change away from the same original location
is tried. In this way, trees that are the state
of the Markov chain more often are exactly
the more probable trees. In fact, the rejection probability is calculated such that a tree
that is twice as probable will be the state of

recent version 2.5.0 (Bouckaert et al. 2014,
Drummond & Bouckaert 2015, Bouckaert
2018a), provides an extensible implementation of MCMC for tree inferences. The
pseudo-Dollo covarion model is provided by
the Babel add-on for BEAST2, which we use
in version 0.2.0 (Bouckaert 2019).
Because of the vast number of possible extensions and model choices, BEAST2 configuration files tend to be unwieldy large and
complex. In order to generate the configuration files for the analyses, we therefore
use the Beastling application, version 1.4.0
(Maurits et al. 2018, 2017). Beastling allows
the user to specify a phylogentic analysis for
linguistics in a concise format, taking reasonable defaults for options not specified explicitly. The Beastling configuration for our
baseline analysis (B) can be seen in Fig. 8. All
Beastling configuration files, as well as the
BEAST2 xml configurations generated from
them, can be found in the Supplementary Information.
We run the inference for 5 000 000 steps,
logging results every 500 steps to avoid a
high correlation between subsequent samples. For the baseline analysis, we also execute a run with 50 000 000 steps, sampled
every 5 000 steps. The first samples reflect
the starting point of the analysis and not
its posterior distribution, so we discard the
first 10% of samples, and we check using
Tracer 1.7.1 (Tracer: Posterior Summarisation
in Bayesian Phylogenetics. 2019, Rambaut et al.
2018) whether the chain appears to have converged and whether the resulting 9 000 samples are dissimilar enough of each other to
reflect an effective sample size of at least 200.

choices

and with clean meaning-form mapping; the
data is automatically cognate-coded using
LexStat to obtain similarity scores between
forms, from which disjoint cognate classes
are generated by running the informap clustering algorithm on the graph of all pairs of
forms with a distance less than θ = 0.55.
We treat all forms that appear to be cognate with Indonesian as recent loans and
exclude them from our data set. We infer
trees from this data set (using the BEASTling
and BEAST2 software packages) by means of
Bayesian phylogenetic inference, with a binary covarion model with Γ rate variation
between different concepts and trees following a Birth-Death tree prior, calibrated at
the ancestors of Oirata (279–286 yBP), the
ancestor of all AP languages (3137.5±162.6
yBP) and the TAP root (before 3000 yBP). The
BEASTling configuaration file describing this
analysis can be seen in Fig. 8.
We then run and compare a further ten
different analyses, which are summarized in
Table 5.

3. Results
The complete results of the phylogenetic
inferences are available in the supplementary material.
Using BEAST2’s MODELSELECTION 1.4.0 package (Bouckaert 2018b),
we ran a stepping-stone analysis (Xie et al.
2011, Lartillot & Philippe 2006) with 20 steps3
for each analysis. This method estimates the
marginal likelihood of a model, or, equivalently, the evidence in favour of that model.
The marginal likelihoods of our analyses are
summarized in Tables 6 and 7. The overview
shows that the models T5 and T6, which use
a relaxed clock model, perform best, with
3

To summarize, our baseline analysis (B) uses
LexiRumah TAP data in a comparable format

Comparison between 8, 20, 50, 70 and 100 steps indicated that 20 steps are sufficient for a reasonable
estimate.

All variant analyses seem to also have reached a
plateau after around 1 000 000 steps, which makes
us confident in the results given. Repeating all
analyses to 50 000 000 time steps would likely show
similar results at sufficient effective sample size,
but is currently outside our computational capacity.

(subgroups) show up in every tree of the sample. The most striking feature of this tree,
compared with the one that has been established manually (Fig. 2, HPhon2012), is the
very clear second-order split immediately
below the proto-Alor-Pantar node between
the languages of east Alor (Kamang, Wersing,
Sawila, Kula) on one side, and the languages
of west Alor, Pantar and the Straits on the
other side.
The overview of all inference runs, Figs. 11
and 12, shows that the resulting tree topologies are vastly similar for all model choices.
The split between east Alor and the other
AP languages, in particular, appears in all of
them. The only exception is analysis T5. T5
is identical to T6 apart from the shape of the
tree prior, which suggests that it is the birthdeath tree prior which enforces the particular shape of T5, and that its shape is not so
much a feature of the data as it is a feature
of the highly parametric (and therefore modifyable) clock with a relatively strong tree
prior.
Another interesting feature of our B tree
is that some of the earlier established subgroups do not appear as such in our tree. According to our analysis, the most recent common ancestor of the varieties of Adang is also
the ancestor of Hamap and Kabola, and not of
Blagar. This is consistent among all the analyses we ran, but in the analysis of Holton et
al 2012, Blagar forms a lowel-level subgroup
with Adang (see Fig. 2, HPhon2012).
Overall, our analyses show a very consistent picture of the initial splits of the family. They indicate the following subgrouping
structure, also shown in Fig. 13. The firstorder splits are between Bunak, the E Timor
languages, and the AP languages. The AP languages then split into two major branches:
(i) an East-Alor (EA) subgroup (Wersing, Sawila, Kula, Kamang) opposed to (ii) the Nuclear AP (NAP) languages comprising (a) a

group of Alor languages (West and Central),
(b) a group of Pantar and Straits languages.
The split of proto-AP into its two major subgroups is consistently dated later than the
original separation of the Timor languages.
Zooming in on the East-Alor subgroup,
there Kamang is the first language to split
off, in more than 90% of the tree sample.
However, sometimes Kamang shows up as a
NAP language. This happens most strongly
in analysis C1 and M1, which generally have
a badly resolved topology.
The two subgroups of NAP are robust in
all analyses. In Alor, the C Alor subgroup includes Abui, Kui and Kiraman in all analyses,
and also includes Kafoa in all analyses except
for analysis C2. Most analyses group Klon
with Central Alor in the majority of posterior
samples, but a minority of cases groups Klon
with the W Alor languages. This is the case
for more than one third of the posterior sample in the analysis that included loans (L1).
In the analysis where all Indonesian loans
and highly borrowable concepts from WoLD
were excluded (L2), only 1.1% of the posterior trees group Klon with W Alor. Kafoa is
grouped as the closest relative of either Abui
or Klon.
The W Alor group of Adang, Hamap, and
Kabola forms a distinct clade. Interestingly,
the variety Otvai (which LexiRumah lists as
dialect of Adang, and Glottolog as a dialect
of Kabola) always groups with Hamap before
another dialect of Adang or Kabola, and the
Otvai-Hamap clade is inferred with a time
depth that is similar to the time depth of languages in the tree.
Other subgroups that were inferred consistently in all our analyses are the Pantar
subgroup, comprising the Straits languages
(various dialects of Blagar together with Reta
and Kaera) and the Pantar languages.

4. Comparison with
previous work
Here we outline the differences between our
tree and the ones proposed earlier by Holton
et al. (2012), Robinson & Holton (2012), and
how these differences can be explained.
Holton et al. (2012) propose a family tree
for AP (reproduced in Fig. 2, HPhon2012)
that is based on shared phonological innovations in twelve AP languages. The methodology used involved manually coded cognate
classes, manual removal of loans, and manual investigation of regular sound changes.
This tree is also the one represented by Glottolog (Hammarström et al. 2018).
The tree in Holton et al. (2012) shows relatively little resolution and no delineation
of a Pantar subgroup, so that all Pantar languages are considered as primary split-offs
from proto-AP. Also, they have both Blagar as
well as the East-Alor languages fairly deeply
embedded in the tree. They suggest an origin and original break-up of the AP family in
East Pantar (Holton et al. 2012: 118).
In contrast, all our analyses consider the
E Alor languages a first order split off from
proto-AP and view the Pantar languages as
forming a node within the higher Nuclear AP
subgroup. In none of our analyses we found
evidence for a Straits-W Alor subgroup, comprising Adang, Blagar and Klon as proposed
in Holton et al. (2012: 112). Instead, Adang
and Blagar are each part of different lowerlevel subgroups (W Alor vs. Straits), while
Klon generally goes in the C Alor group.
How can these differences be explained?
One possible explanation is that Holton et
al. (2012) analysed phonological innovations,
while we analysed lexical changes. In the
classic Comparative Method, phonological
innovations are the primary evidence used
for subgrouping. However, a methodological

concern of that method, which is also explicitly mentioned in Holton et al. (2012), is the
fact that the trees that are constructed on the
basis of regular sound changes do not always
converge, and we lack an explicit and objective theory to weigh which regular sound
changes count as evidence to construct subgroupings and which ones do not. Holton
et al. (2012) observe eleven regular sound
changes in their body of lexical data (see Table 8), but most of these sound changes delineate language subgroups that are overlapping rather than discrete (e.g. *b > f groups
Abui with Teiwa and Klamu, while *d > r
groups Abui with Kui). The linguist thus has
to make a choice which of the sound changes
represent actual stages in the evolution of
the family and hence define subgroups; and
which ones do not. Holton et al. (2012) chose
six out of the fifteen observed regular sound
changes as innovations in the evolution of
the family tree, and marked them besides the
corresponding nodes in Fig. 2 (HPhon2012),
dismissing the remaining nine.
Overlapping sound changes such as those
observed by Holton et al. (2012) can have
different causes. Sound changes may diffuse across languages that are in contact
with each other; or they may be unmarked
changes (in the sense that they are commonly attested in genealogically and geographically distant or unrelated languages)
which can occur as parallel but independent innovations in different subgroups. It
is likely that both sound change diffusion and
parallel sound changes are obscuring the historical signal in the AP family, so that regular
sound changes may not be the best evidence
to use for defining its subgroups. If sound
changes are used for that purpose, choices
have to be made as to which of them define
subgroups and which are considered to be
the result of either diffusion or parallel innovation. It is almost impossible to make such

unconstrained tree. Importantly, the protoAP node was used as an outgroup to root the

While there are similarities between
RDol2012 and our replication MR, there are
also some major differences. One difference
concerns the position of Klon (going with
Kiraman rather than with Adang in the majority). A major difference is the position
of the East-Alor subgroup as a primary split
from the top node, while it was embedded
inside the tree in RDol2012.
This is due to the fact that, unlike
RDol2012, we did not force proto-AP to be the
outgroup. Doing that would result in more
subgroupings in especially the Alor side of
the tree. However, positing proto-AP as the
outgroup implies that it is an unbiased reconstruction. Any minor biases in the protoAP reconstruction are exacerbated by using it as an independent data source of particular importance. The fact that proto-AP
ends up as a sister language to Abui and the
other nuclear Alor-Pantar languages in our
MR analysis (see Fig. 14a) suggests that the
reconstructed proto-AP forms do not take
the East-Alor languages into account enough,
and that a tree with that reconstructed language as root fails to address some properties
of the data. The fact that the Abui-East-Alorclade in Fig. 3 has a support of only 0.4 may
be a further indication of that issue; note that
in contrast all clades in Fig. 14b have a support value of more than 0.75 (except for the
Pantar clade, where the affiliation of Western Pantar is unclear).
In general it is problematic to use the same
data for both the inference and the reconstruction of a phylogenetic tree. Even when
included only for visualization (such as in our
replication MR), reconstructed forms can introduce biases and should be handled with
care.
We consider a second replication of
RDol2012, which we denote R2, again using their data (now with proto-AP removed
from the dataset) and codings, but now us-

ing our baseline binary covarion model (B).
This posterior sample also shows various
differences to RDol2012, such as (i) the E
Alor languages as an early subgroup of the
AP branch, sometimes together with Abui,
(ii) the position of Blagar inside the Pantar
subgroup instead of the Alor subgroup, and
(iii) the clustering of Klon with Kui instead of
Adang. We suggest that the cognate classes
used in RDol2012 may have been a major
reason for the differences.
In sum, the tree in RDol2012 and our replications of it (MR and R2) as well as our baseline tree B agree in recognizing a subgroup
of Pantar languages. Major differences again
concern the position of the East-Alor subgroup as deeply embedded vs. early split off,
as well as the position of Blagar as going with
the Alor group vs. the Pantar group. To conclude, the differences between the manually
constructed HPhon2012 tree, the RDol2012
tree and our baseline tree B mainly concern
(i) the position of the East-Alor group deeply
inside the tree vs. early split off, and (ii) the
position of Blagar as grouping with the languages of Alor or with the languages of Pantar.
The tree in HPhon2012 has less resolution
than all the other trees, for example by not
recognizing a subgroup comprising the Pantar languages. This lack of resolution can be
explained by the confusing signal of overlapping sound changes, which also suggests a
possible point of contention of that tree. The
differences between the RDol2012 tree and
our baseline tree B, as well as our replications of RDol2012 are likely largely due to (i)
methodological issues of forcing the protolanguage as outgroup and using the same
data for both tree inference and reconstruction, with (ii) a smaller contribution from the
quality and breadth of the underlying data,
with fewer language varieties and fewer concepts per variety than the data used here.

5. Discussion
Our analysis shows a very strong signal of
subgrouping of the Timor-Alor-Pantar family. The first-order splits between Bunak and
all other Timor-Alor-Pantar languages is a
recurrent feature in nearly all of our sampled
trees, and the AP languages are consistently
inferred with an early split between EastAlor languages and Nuclear-AP languages.
This split was not found in any of the earlier
proposals. It is supported by regular innovations, of which we will mention three types in
the following (there may be more). (Example
cognate sets are provided in appendix A.)
Proto-Nuclear Alor Pantar saw a lexical innovation, adding a lexeme *-om ’inside’ to
the expression used for ’(be) inside’, while
proto-East-Alor retained the original form
reflecting proto-TAP *mi ’be in, at’; which is
also found in reconstructions for the Timor
branches (Klamer 2018), see Fig. 16. 5
Here we mention two phonological innovations that support the split. Proto-TAP
intervocalic *d changed into a liquid *r in
proto-Nuclear AP, but was retained in protoEast-Alor; see Fig. 17, where this is illustrated
for proto-TAP *hada ‘fire’. (Other cognate
classes showing this pattern are ’sugarcane’,
’tongue’ and ’new’; see the data in Kaiping et
al. (2019)).
The opposite pattern of innovation cum
retention is found for proto-TAP intervocalic
*b. This obstruent became voiceless *p in
proto-East-Alor but was retained in protoNuclear AP, see Fig. 18, where this is illustrated for proto-TAP *habi ’fish’. Other cog5

Note that the figures in this section assume a protoTimor node (using the reconstructions of Schapper
et al. (2017)), while the node is not supported by
our analyses. The observation of innovations that
separate nuclear Alor-Pantar from East-Alor languages is however independent of the existence of
this node.

nate classes showing this pattern are ’bat’
and ’sun’ (see the data in Kaiping et al.
(2019)).
In sum, the primary split observed in all
our automatic inferences is supported by a
number of innovations that are established
independently, using the classic comparative
method.
Early split-offs are often taken to reflect
the greatest age, so that the location of
such a split may point to an area where the
proto-language began to diversify, c.f. Sapir
(1916)’s “centre of gravity principle”. An
early East-Alor primary subgroup of AP may
suggest that the proto-AP speakers first arrived on the (south-)eastern coast of Alor and
spread westwards over the course of subsequent centuries. This scenario contrasts
with earlier proposals where the homeland
of AP was hypothesized to be on Pantar, with
a subsequent direction of movement of the
languages from west to east (Holton et al.
2012), or where the homeland was on an island in the Straits between Alor and Pantar (Robinson & Holton 2012: 143), with languages moving west to Pantar, and east to
Alor. A phylogeographic inference, which
takes the cultural adaptation necessary to
move between different biomes (eg. from
coast to mountains) into account, may be
able to give deeper insight into the migration
history of the region.
Within the East-Alor group, the languages
Kula, Sawila and Wersing are grouped together in every tree sampled in every analysis, which gives conclusive support for this
subgroup. In addition, most analyses include
Kamang in the group. We hypothesize that
Kamang is an East-Alor language by origin,
but may have had significant contact with
one or more Central Alor languages (Abui is
currently its big neighbouring language), so
that it appears more similar to the Central
Alor languages now. An opposite hypothe-

sis would assume that Kamang belongs to the
Nuclear AP branch but had contact to EastAlor languages and thus became more similar to them. However, because Kamang is
classified as an East-Alor language by 90% of
the trees in analysis ML, which is our most
zealous effort in reducing the influence of
loans, we consider the first hypothesis more
likely than its opposite.
The Nuclear AP languages split into an
Alor and Pantar group. The Alor group splits
into a Central-Alor subgroup, formed of Abui,
Kui, Kiraman, Kafoa and Klon, and a W Alor
group. The Pantar group splits into a Pantar
and a Straits group. Our inferences suggest
that, contrary to earlier findings, there is
no separate Straits-West-Alor group. The affiliation of Western Pantar remains unclear,
and the language appears to be a linchpin
in several inferences. This suggests that a
systematic comparative study of the Western
Pantar language might be helpful in also discerning the immediate subgrouping structure of the Alor-Pantar Straits subfamily.

east of Alor, followed by a subsequent westward movement of the languages.
In addition, the data suggests an early
split between Bunak and the other TimorAlor-Pantar languages. This split is not inferred with as much consistency as the nuclear AP/East-Alor split and warrants further
investigation.
The historical connections inferred for the
TAP languages depend on both the granularity of data and the methodological choices of
the researchers. We have seen that in classical models of reconstruction the (subjective) weighting of conflicting sound change
evidence determines the subgrouping, while
in Bayesian inference, it is the choice of
evolutionary model and rooting methodology (including implicit rooting). It is important to take these methodological considerations into account when the inferred genealogies are used as windows on the linguistic past, and even more so when they are
combined with evidence to reconstruct the
non-linguistic past.

6. Conclusion

Supplementary Material

In conclusion, our lexicon-based analysis indicates the subgrouping structure of the
Timor-Alor-Pantar language family shown in
Fig. 19.
The major features of this tree are consistently inferred using various state-of-the-art
methods of cognate detection and tree inference. The newly found early split of the AlorPantar branch into an East-Alor subgroup
and a Nuclear Alor-Pantar subgroup robustly
appears from all our inferences as well as
from the replication of an earlier Bayesian
study which was based on a smaller data set.
This early split can be supported by lexical
and phonological innovations. It suggests
that the Alor-Pantar speakers arrived in the
