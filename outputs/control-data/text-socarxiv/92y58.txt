Abstract. We introduce an actor-centric approach to predict the severity of conflict one month
into the future. We argue that the prediction of conflict severity needs to focus on the actors
that are responsible for conducting armed violence. Hence, we predict the severity of conflict
in government-rebel organization dyads. Our predictors focus especially on rebel organization
characteristics, behavior, and the conflict networks actors are embedded in. Our statistical learning
approach relies on random forests to predict the severity of conflict. We demonstrate that our
model performs especially well in distinguishing high levels of severity from very low levels, and
yields better predictions that geography-based prediction models.

1. Introduction
Civil wars vary greatly in the degree to which they escalate and thereby affect civilians [46],
regional stability, and global order [50]. For example, the extent to which conflicts force people to
seek refuge abroad is consistently a function of its severity [1, 113] and its geographic scope [81]. We
put forward a novel actor-based machine learning approach to predict the severity of conflict one
month ahead to enable early warning facilities and contribute to the important and fast growing
field of conflict prediction [26, 57].
While severity is a fundamental aspect of conflict dynamics [6], few attempts exist in the civil
war literature to predict the variation in intensity of conflict [17, 4, 63]. The majority of forecasting
efforts focus on the onset or occurrence of civil war [116, 62]. Severity is much more at the center
of approaches focusing on one-sided violence [120, 92, 97, 53, 28] and terrorism [34]. The limited
focus on civil war severity in prediction studies is quite surprising, as the field of conflict prediction
is growing rapidly [e.g. 58, 88, 101, 54, 117, 100, 43, 116, 51, 62, 9, 18, 27, 61, 86, 10, 30, 87].
We provide a novel contribution to the conflict prediction literature, as we explicitly focus on the
prediction of actor behavior. While prediction approaches to inter-state conflict very much capture
the behavior of actors [21] and its severity [32, 18], civil war predictions mostly concentrate on
geographic locations (countries, regions, or grids) [60]. A geographic unit is often necessary in the
context of civil war onset, as we cannot observe actors until they decide to fight the government.
However, once the universe of actors is identified, there is an opportunity to make actor-based
conflict predictions regarding the occurrence, duration, and severity of conflict [compare 82, 49, 44].
The advantage of actor-based predictions is that we can model the behavior of decision-making

organizations and rely on a broad theoretical literature to inform predictive feature selection and
creation [91, 115, 39, 42, 31, 110, 56, 72]. Hence, in our predictive models we include features
that account for actors’ characteristics, their past behavior, and interdependencies between rebel
organizations. Compared to a geographic prediction approach, an actor-centric approach also has
the advantage of only modeling the relevant set of units, which reduces the sparsity in the observed
data. Grid-based forecasting approaches can entail many cells without any conflict activity, creating
highly unbalanced prediction challenges [60].

Severity in armed conflict
The interest in explaining the severity of armed conflicts can be traced to the very beginnings of
quantitative conflict research. Richardson [95] already identified a power-law relationship between
the frequency and severity of ‘deadly quarrels’. Indeed power-law based explanations of severity
gained renewed attention in conflict studies [96, 25] with applications to armed inter- and intrastate
conflict [2, 11, 99, 112, 48] and terrorist attacks [34, 33, 90].
The work of Richardson [95] also inspired work to link the temporal dimension of conflict with
severity. Already in the early 1960s Markov process driven relationships between severity of wars
their duration were found [118]. This linkage between time and severity was further explored
by Klingberg [71] who puts forward a breaking point theory in the context of interstate wars,
demonstrating that severity is especially high at the beginning and that conflicts end if the first
derivative of the cumulative density function of casualties approaches zero. Similarly, Voevodsky
[114] shows temporal patterns that indicate that early stages in interstate wars see higher levels of
violence.
Research projects collecting more fine-grained information on the behavior of states [98, 79, 3, 75]
enabled a new generation of severity models that focused on the intensity of events and its actors
[102, 14, 12, 13]. Concepts of reciprocity [16], conflict-cooperation scales [106], and interdependencies [65] between actors are central to the behavioral actor-centric approaches. The actor-centric
perspective on predicting severity also allowed for linkages to formal modeling approaches. For example, based on an expected utility model of war Bueno de Mesquita [22] predicts that casualties
rise with an increasing utility of war [see also 23].
Compared to the inter-state war literature, civil war research on the severity of conflict is relatively small [24]. An initial study by [73] shows that severe civil wars are related to duration
[compare 45], ethnic homogeneity, foreign assistance, and non-democracies. A particular focus in
the civil war literature has been on economic development and studies have linked lower economic
development [28], food insecurity [119], and economic inequality [77] with more severe conflicts.
However, on the subnational level the link between economic development remains ambiguous. In
a subnational study of FARC violence, [66] relate severe violence to departments with poverty, low
growth, and state repression. But in Liberia, [64] demonstrate the opposite finding that rebels
tend to target ‘wealthy’ locations and therefore find a negative relationship between poverty and
severity of conflict, which is in line with [78] highlighting that civil wars are most severe when they
take place in areas of oil and gas production in the context of secessionist conflicts.

and their connection through fighting the same government (edges). This dependency structure is used to create spatial lags of all variables that measure actor
characteristics and behavior.
Lacina’s[73] finding that foreign assistance is linked to more severe conflicts has resulted in a
broader agreement that third-party actors alone increase severity [107], but mediation and peacekeeping decrease battle-deaths [68, 8]. Furthermore, scholars have explored the role of economic
sanctions that increase severity, whereas arms embargoes decrease severity [69]. Conventional
weapon transfers seem to be related to more severe civil wars [85, 80].
Again following Lacina’s [73] initial insights about ethnic homogeneity, ethnicity has been linked
to the severity of civil wars in several ways. While Eck [45] demonstrates that ethnic conflicts
generally have a higher risk of intensification, other research proposes that ethnic polarization
especially affects severity at the beginning of conflicts [37] and shows that ethnic inequality is
related to more severe conflicts [67]. From a more institutional perspective, Heger and Salehyan
[59] argue that government coalitions led by small ethnic groups have the highest risk of conflict
severity.
Finally, it is important to distinguish between escalation and severity in this context. In the
context of international relations scholars, escalation describes the process by which political conflict
or contest escalates to war [52, 104, 94, 36, 74], whereas severity describes variation in armed conflict

PREDICTING SEVERITY OF CIVIL WARS

once it has escalated to this level. Theories of escalation of inter-state wars tend to focus on the
path from contentious issues or low-level conflict to war, but are less interested in the variation of
severity once inter-state conflicts have broken out [19, 103, 15]. Similarly, studies of repression and
dissent [76, 89], as well as non-violent to violent protests [29] are more interested in the escalation,
rather than the severity of the outcome.

Actor characteristics, behavior, and dependencies
We present a prediction framework of severity that accounts for complex interactions between
actor characteristics, behavior, and interdependencies. Actor characteristics form an important
aspect of conflict dynamics. Capacity, resources, or strength have been systematically linked to
the occurrence, duration, and severity of conflict [56, 110, 39, 35]. In our predictive framework, we
account for actors characteristics, behavior, and interdependence by relying on data from UCDP
GED (v.18.1) [109, 38] and PRIO-GRID (v.2.0) [111].1
We measure actor characteristics by operationalizing variables that account for maximal observed
features of severity that allows us to differentiate between stronger and weaker organizations,2 the
time since the organization has started fighting the government,3 and the extent of transnational
fighting events.4
We capture actor behavior by focusing on short run variation in past levels of severity inflicted
by rebels on government and level of severity inflicted by government on rebels (lagged dependent
variables). Furthermore, we measure the days affected by violent events in a month that involve the
respective rebel organization, the number of violent events per month, the geographic scope of rebel
operations (number of PRIO-GRIDS5 affected by violent events involving a rebel organization).
Finally, we account for the argument that rebel organizations do not act in isolation. Rebel
organizations are likely to condition their behavior on the behavior of the government and those
of other rebel organizations, which affects the severity of conflict [24, 83]. Hence, we first include
lagged measures of casualties that the government inflicts on the particular rebel organization and
vice-versa. Second, the current literature demonstrates that rebel dependencies and configurations
matter [e.g. 40, 39, 31]. Multi-actor setting also give rise to alliance and fragmentation dynamics
[5, 7, 47, 42, 105], which are argued to be associated with longer civil conflict duration [41, 31].
We account for interdependencies by creating spatial lags of all character and behavioral variables.
To calculate the spatial lags we first calculate a dependency matrix that connects all actors that
fight the same government. This connectivity matrix is visualized in Figure 1. We then multiply
the dependency matrix with each of our features to account for interdependencies. All features are

temporally lagged before including them into the prediction models. Prediction models include 1-6
month time lags.
Actor-based predicting of Battle-related Deaths
We predict battle-deaths 1-month ahead in a government-rebel organization dyad and distinguish between battle-deaths that rebel organizations inflict upon government forces and those that
government forces inflict upon the rebels.6 Battle-deaths are measured at the monthly level and we
distinguish between 4 levels of intensity: Level 0 (no battle-deaths), Level 1 (1-24 battle deaths),
Level 2 (24-99 battle deaths), Level 3 (100+battle deaths). Relying on the UCDP-dyadic data
(v.18.1), we define the universe of government-rebel organization dyads that are included in our
study (N=317). For these government-rebel dyads we extract battle-deaths information from the
event data base UCDP GED (v.18.1), which provides information on the time, location, and severity of an armed conflict event. Battle-deaths are measured by using the best estimate of battle
deaths in a UCDP-GED event.7
We apply random forests to predict the categorical outcome variable. Random forest is a popular
ensemble learning method [20] combining bagged trees with a randomized variable selection step
to reduce variance. In political science, it has shown improvement over traditional statistical
approaches [108, 70, 86, 84]. We use the ranger [121] implementation in R statistical language for
its computational efficiency. Using 79 features, we grow 500 trees and conduct a grid search to
identify the top performing set of hyper-parameters: the number of randomly selected variables at
each split (mtry=2,5,9) and tree splitting rule (split rule) while holding the minimum node size
constant at 1.
We separate the data into a training (N=18330, T=1989-2009) and test sample (N=6110,
T=2010-2017). The training of the random forest is done by 10-fold cross-validation without
splitting observations across folds. Hence, all observations of rebel organization i will be in fold
k. We apply this cross-validation strategy, because we aim to learn about escalation dynamics
across and not within rebel organizations. Model performance is assessed using the test sample. In
Table 1 we provide sensitivity, specificity, precision, and balanced accuracy for both models. All
models perform very well in identifying the Level 0 category, but especially sensitivity decreases
with higher levels of severity. However, the relatively low sensitivity at higher levels of severity
obstructs the observation that a) misclassification to closer severity levels is more likely than to
distant ones and b) our models tend to do well in separating high severity from low severity events.
Geography-based predicting of Battle-related Deaths
In order to test whether an actor-based approach is more effective in predicting conflict severity, we conduct an identical geography-based approach. This means that we construct the same
indicators, but aggregated to the PRIO-Grid level instead of the actor level. Hence, as opposed to
predicting the severity at the actor-level, we train the model to predict severity at the PRIO grid
level and include lagged variables for whether actors were present in the grid in previous months.

We also run all analysis for 6-months ahead predictions. The results are presented in the appendix. The findings
and conclusions drawn are the same.

Again, we apply random forests to predict the categorical outcome variable of conflict intensity:
Level 0 (no battle-deaths), Level 1 (1-24 battle deaths), Level 2 (24-99 battle deaths), Level 3
(100+battle deaths). We separate the data into a training (N=219519, T=1989-2009) and test
sample (N=54879, T=2010-2017). As noted previously, there is greater sparsity in the data used in
the geographic prediction approach because it includes all PRIO grids, many of which may not be
relevant to the conflict actors. Other than the data structure, the modelling procedure is identical
to that described above.

Table 2 reports the results for the geographic approach. Similar to the actor-based approach
reported in Table 1, both models perform well in identifying Level 0 category. In fact, the geographic
approach is better at predicting Level 0, which is likely due to the sparsity of the data. However,
the geographic models are less effective in correctly predicting higher levels of severity compared
to actor-based models. They are less effective in correctly predicting Level 1 severity (1-24 battle
deaths). For example, sensitivity is just 0.230 and 0.232 compared to 0.534 and 0.435 for models
predicting causalities inflicted on the government by rebel and vice-versa, respectively. Difficulties
in predicting the most severe levels are more pronounced in the geographic models. Looking once
more at sensitivity, it decreases to 0 for Level 2 and Level 3 in both models, considerably worse than

actor-based models which is 0 only in predicting Level 3 severity. Although actor-based models also
struggle to predict Level 3 severity, they are more effective in distinguishing between Level 1 and
Level 2 as indicated by higher sensitivity, specificity, precision, and balance accuracy. The results
presented for both approaches indicate that the geographic approach under-performs in predicting
the highest levels of severity, that is any level that surpasses 24 battle deaths (both levels 2 and 3).
In the next section, we provide a further comparison between the actor-based and geography-based
approaches.
A systematic comparison of both approaches
Figure 1 provides confusion matrices for the the actor-based (top row) and geography-based
(bottom row) models. The figure once more emphasises the general trend for all models that they
under-predict higher levels of severity. However, they provide important additional information

PREDICTING SEVERITY OF CIVIL WARS

on the false positives. Looking at panel a for casualties inflicted on the government by rebels, we
observe that predictions of high severity (Level 2) are associated with few false positives in regard
to Level 0. This means that if the model predicts a Level 2 severity month, there is a very low
probability that no casualties will be observed in this month. Just one observation for both actorbased models has a predicted class of Level 3 when the observed class was Level 2. However, we see
that the models under-predict severity, as opposed to failing to predict it altogether. For instance,
in panel a for casualties inflicted on the government by rebels, 58% (18/31) of observed Level 3
are classified as Level 2, 39% (12/31) are classified as Level 1, and just 3% (1/31) are classified as
Level 0. This pattern is similar in panel b for casualties inflicted on the rebels by the government,
although the percentage of Level 3 observed classes classified as Level 2 is higher (78%).8
Similarly, when analyzing the classification of the 91 realized Level 3 months in the test set
of rebel organization inflicting casualties on the government (panel c), we can report that the
geography-based models are significantly worse at predicting higher levels of severity. For instance,
only 1% (1/91) of Level 3 are classified as Level 2 and 40% (36/91) are classified at Level 1.
Worryingly, the majority of realised Level 3 cases, 59% (54/91), are classified as Level 0. The
trend is almost identical for the classification of the 91 realized Level 3 months in the test set of
government inflicting casualties on the rebel organisations (panel d).9 This trend is clearly visible
by red shading across the different levels of severity. We can conclude that the actor-based models
might not always predict the correct level of severity, but that higher levels of intensity have a
lower probability of being classified as a Level 0 month than for the geography-based models.
Furthermore, geography-based models are not only less likely to predict higher levels of severity,
they are are also more prone to miss-classifying higher levels as expecting no observed casualties
(Level 0).
The ability of the prediction models to separate months that experienced a certain level of severity from those that experienced a different level is visualized in Figure 3. For the models in both
approaches, we provide a separation plot for each severity level. Separation plots were initially designed for binary outcomes [55], where realized observations (red bars) and unrealized observations
(grey bars) are ranked according to their predicted probability (black line). A perfect separation
occurs if any realized observation has a higher probability than any unrealized observation, which
would leave all grey bars to the left and all red bars to the right of the separation plot. This
concept can easily be generalized to a multi-categorical outcome [55], by providing separation plots
for each category. For example, Figure 3 A pertains to actor-based model predicting government
casualties inflicted by the rebels and provides separation plots for Level 0 (bottom), Level 1 (lower
middle), Level 2 (upper middle), Level 3 (top). For all models we can observe that Level 0, Level
2, and Level 3 months are fairly well separated and that the greatest challenge comes from Level
1 months (1-24 casualties). Going back to Figure 1, we can see that many realized Level 1 months
are classified as Level 0 months, which questions the ability to correctly distinguish low severity
months from no severity months in the context of an ongoing civil war. Figure 3 shows that the
878% (94/121) of observed Level 3 are classified as Level 2, 19% (23/121) are classified as Level 1 and just 3% (4/121)

are classified as Level 0.
91% (1/91) of observed Level 3 are classified as Level 2, 43% (39/91) are classified as Level 1, and 56% (51/91) are
classified as Level 0.

actor-based models are more effective in correctly predicting (i.e. separating) levels of severity,
which is particularly visible for prediction of Level 1 severity (1-24 casualties).

Global fatality comparison
An interesting question is how the underprediction of the actor and geographic models translates
into fatality estimates, especially because the escalation levels on the actor level are naturally higher
than on the grid level. Hence, for each observed and predicted observation on the actor and grid
level, we assign fatalities to escalation levels. For each observation and prediction, we draw from the
underlying fatality distribution at each level for both the grid and actor level. From 1000 draws, we
are then able to sum fatalities at the global monthly level for predicted and observed levels, both
for the actor and grid model. Focusing on the difference between observed and predicted values, we
compare the actor and geographic models in relation to fatalities inflicted on governments and the
rebel organizations. The global fatality comparisons in Figure 4 shows that the actor model (red)
underpredicts fatalities, but to a lesser degree than the geographic model (blue). This difference is
particularly pronounced in the fatalities inflicted on government forces, shown in the top panel.

Case illustration
To demonstrate the performance of actor-based models in a more accessible and applied way,
we use a case illustration on the actor level. Figure 5 displays predictions from the actor-based
models for Al-Qaida and the Forces of Hadi in Yemen over time. The plots show the predicted
probabilities for each severity level per time and actor. At each point in time, the model predicts
the intensity level that is associated with the highest predicted probability. In the figure, correct
predictions that correspond with the actually observed level of violence are marked in green, while
incorrect predictions are displayed in red.
Overall, the two examples underline the strengths of actor-based models in separating Level 0
predictions (no violence) from Level 1 predictions (few violent events). This is particularly clear

in the case of Al-Qaida on the left side with many correct (green) predictions for Level 0 and 1.
The visualization also demonstrates that with increasing intensity it becomes difficult to correctly
predict levels of battle-related deaths.

Conclusion
In this paper, we provide an actor-centric approach to the prediction of civil war severity by
focusing on the rebel-government dyad. We distinguish between severity of armed violence the
government inflicts on rebel organizations and which the rebel organizations inflict on the government forces. These levels of severity are predicted at the monthly level with 1-month and 6-month
ahead random forest models. Using features that relate to the rebel organization characteristics,
behavior, and the interdependencies between organization, we are able to perform especially well
in separating high levels of battle related deaths from months with no battle-related deaths being
recorded. The main challenge that our predictive models face is to distinguish between low and no
severity months, but this might not be surprising in the context of an ongoing civil war.
We believe that an actor-centric prediction approach is especially useful in the context of civil
war severity, duration, and termination as it focuses on the actual perpetrators of armed violence.
However, when predicting the onset of new actors/conflicts or the geographic diffusion of violence,
actor-centric approaches need to be integrated and supplemented by geographic approaches.

Figure 6. Confusion matrices for test-sample predictions on a 6 month basis. The
first row (panels a and b) panels pertain to actor-based models for casualties inflicted
on the government by rebels (Reb → Gov) and casualties inflicted by the government
on the rebels (Gov → Reb). The second row (panels c and d) pertains to the
geography-based models. Color shading refers to percentage of observed severity
level months in the respective predicted categories. Numbers in cells refer to a
count of observations that fall into this category. A perfect model would only have
entries on the diagonal.

PREDICTING SEVERITY OF CIVIL WARS

(a) Actor model: Reb→Gov

(b) Actor model: Gov→Reb

(c) Geo model: Reb→Gov

(d) Geo model: Gov→Reb

Figure 7. Separation plots for test-sample predictions for 6-month ahead. Panels
A pertain to actor-based predictions and panels B to geography-based predictions
for casualties inflicted on the government by rebels (Reb→Gov). Panels C and D
are the same for casualties inflicted by the government on the rebels (Gov→Reb).
In each panel, separation plots are provided for each level of severity. Level 0 (no
battle-deaths = top), Level 1 (1-24 battle deaths = upper middle), Level 2 (25-99
battle deaths = lower middle), Level 3 (+100 battle deaths = bottom).
