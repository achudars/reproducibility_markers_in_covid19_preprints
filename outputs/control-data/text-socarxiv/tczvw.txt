Abstract
Cascades over social networks can spread information, beliefs, diseases, technologies,
and behaviors. Simple cascades spread from mere contact and produce submodular
influence curves. Complex cascades assume agents with thresholding behavior and may
produce non-submodular influence curves. In this study, we run three experiments that
request charitable donations from human participants and experimentally manipulate
whether and where their peers donate. We find evidence that we can (1) direct
donations to an otherwise unpopular charity and (2) elicit complex contagion as
evidenced by a non-submodular influence curve. The findings represent the most
straightforward evidence to date of treatment-induced complex contagion - explicitly
and formally defined - in human decision-making.

Complex Contagions in Charitable Donations
Introduction
Human activity is embedded in a network of social interactions, which can spread
information, beliefs, diseases, technologies, and behaviors. A better understanding of
these social interactions promises a better understanding of and the ability to influence
a wide range of phenomena, e.g., financial practices (Banerjee, Chandrasekhar, Duflo, &
Jackson, 2013; Coleman, Katz, & Menzel, 1957), healthy/unhealthy behaviors (Centola,
2018; Mermelstein, Cohen, Lichtenstein, Baer, & Kamarck, 1986), and voting
habits (Bond et al., 2012; Jones, Bond, Bakshy, Eckles, & Fowler, 2017). In this work,
we examine the effect of social influence on decisions regarding charitable donations.
Many cascade models have been proposed (Arthur, 1989; Morris, 2000; Watts,
2002), and two simple examples are the Independent Cascade model (Kempe,
Kleinberg, & Tardos, 2003, 2005; Mossel & Roch, 2010) and the Threshold
model (Granovetter, 1978). In each of these models, there is a set of nodes on a
network, and some set of these nodes start off “infected”.1 In the Independent Cascade
model, each newly infected node infects each currently uninfected neighbor in the
subsequent round with some fixed probability p. In the Threshold model each node has
a threshold (0, 1, 2, etc.) and becomes infected when the number of infected neighbors
meets or surpasses that threshold.
Cascades that spread according to different models may behave radically
differently. Thus, to understand the way cascades spread requires using the correct
models for these cascades. An especially important distinction, is whether cascades are
simple (e.g. independent cascade model) or complex (e.g. threshold model), a definition
we will formalize soon. Unfortunately, teasing out the forms of cascades requires
isolating the impact of influence from other confounding factors such as homophily and
environmental effects, which is incredibly difficult to do with observational data. This

perhaps more precise for most of the settings we are concerned with, but is considerably more clunky.

motivates our experimental studies.

Complex Cascades
Centola and Macy in their seminal work “Complex Contagions and the Weakness
of Long Ties” (Centola & Macy, 2007) proposed to better understand the myriad
models of cascades by dividing them into just two categories: simple and complex. The
differentiating feature of complex contagion, compared to simple contagions is that
complex contagions require reinforcement from multiple social contacts, while simple
contagions only require one contact.
The definition of complex contagions recognizes an important distinction between
the acquisition of information and the decision to act on the information. While it takes
only a single tie for people to hear about a new belief, technology, fad or fashion, “it is
when they see people they know getting involved that they become most susceptible to
recruitment” (Centola & Macy, 2007). Thus, while the former can be suitably modeled
by a simple contagion, the latter is better modeled by a complex contagion, in which
multiple sources of activation are required because contact with a single active
individual is not enough to trigger adoption. Suggested features of decision contexts
that lead the contagion process to be complex include strategic complementarity,
emotional exchange, and uncertainties surrounding credibility and legitimacy (Centola
& Macy, 2007) and thus apply especially to behaviors involving great risk (e.g.
adopting pricey technologies, emigration, etc.).
Mathematically, a cascade from the general threshold model can be represented as
a tuple G, f, S where G is an undirected graph with vertices V and edges E; f = {fv }v∈V
is a collection of influence functions fv : {0, 1}Γ(v) → [0, 1],

2

and S is a set of initially

infected vertices. Each node has a label `(v) ∈ {0, 1}, and a threshold θv from [0, 1].
Each node v ∈ S starts with `(v) = 1 and is called “infected”, and the remaining nodes
begin labelled `(v) = 0 and are called “non-infected”. A non-infected v node becomes
infected if the influence of its infected neighbors is greater than its threshold: that is
2

We use Γ(v) to denote the neighbors of v in the network.

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

fv (`(Γ(v))) > θv . We denote the expected number of infected vertices with seed set S as
σ(S). Note that σ : 2N → R.
A function f : 2N → R is submodular if f (S ∪ T ) + f (S ∩ T ) ≤ f (S) + f (T ) for
all S, T ⊆ N . Intuitively this definition states that the marginal contribution of each
element decreases as more elements are added. If f depends on the the number of
elements in its input, then this is to say that f (k) is concave.
We say that a cascade is simple if the expected number of infections σ(·) is
submodular, and we say that a cascade is complex if the expected number of infections
σ(·) is non-submodular. Intuitively, a contagion is simple when the influence of an
additionally infected neighbor is marginally decreasing and is complex when this fails to
hold (e.g. contagions that require activation from multiple neighbors). In simple
contagions, there is no synergy. A node’s influence is only eroded by other nodes’. The
Independent Cascade model is a simple cascade because a vertex’s marginal probability
of becoming infected after a new neighbor is infected decreases with the number of
previously infected neighbors (Kempe et al., 2003). In contrast, the Threshold model
(with k > 1) is a complex cascade because the marginal probability of being infected
may increase as more neighbors are infected. For example, if a vertex has a threshold of
2, then the first infected neighbor has zero marginal impact, but the second infected
neighbor causes this vertex to become infected with probability 1.
Here f is based on the number of infected neighbors. We will necessarily average
over all the nodes. We note that if all the fv (·) are sub-modular, then their average is as
well. This is because the set of submodular functions is convex. Conversely, if the
“average” of the influence functions f is non-submodular, then some of the fv ’s must be
non-submodular. Figure 1 graphically represents submodular and non-submodular
influence curves.

Evidence for the Existence of Complex Cascades
There have been few randomized experiments conducted to study complex
contagion. A notable exception is Centola (2010) in which subjects were recruited and

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

6

randomly assigned to two groups. Each group was placed upon a pre-specified network
topology with one network being a random network and the other one being a clustered
lattice network. Diffusion was initiated by a random seed sending signals to its network
neighbors encouraging them to adopt a health-related behavior (registering for a health
forum website), and each adopting neighbor triggered messages sent to her neighbors.
Complex contagions spread wider and faster in the clustered lattice networks and
spread slowly, or stopped spreading, in the random networks. The difference across the
two networks in the number of nodes that eventually adopted provided indirect
evidence that the contagion process was complex.
A “natural experiment” was examined by Aral and Nicolaides (2017). They
examined the contagion of running among friends using weather as an exogenous
variable. However, they did not find that complex contagions were a good fit for their
data.
There have been many observational studies measuring contagions over networks.
Scores of these are surveyed in a recent work by Guilbeault, Becker, and Centola
(2017). Many examples of complex contagions have been reported, including the
purchase of expensive technology, change in social behavior, and the decision to
participate in a migration (Coleman et al., 1957; Macdonald & Macdonald, 1964). In
Christakis and Fowler’s work (Christakis & Fowler, 2008), evidence was found that the
likelihood a smoker will quit depends on their exposure to multiple contacts. This was
confirmed by a more recent study by Kuhlman et al. (2011), and on QuitNet (Myneni,
Cobb, & Cohen, 2013). Another example of complex contagions is Davis’s (Davis &
Greve, 1997) analysis of the spread of “poison pills” through the network of cooperate
board membership in response to the rise in cooperate takeovers during the 1980s.
In computer science, studies of large scale data sets from online social networks
observe traces of complex contagions. For example, studies on Facebook discovered that
having multiple friends already on Facebook substantially increased the likelihood of
one joining Facebook (Ugander, Backstrom, Marlow, & Kleinberg, 2012). A study on
the Twitter platform shows a similar phenomenon, that persistence (the effect of

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

repeated exposure to a topic) plays an important role in the diffusion of
hashtags (Romero, Meeder, & Kleinberg, 2011).
Unfortunately, there are severe limitations to what can be deduced from
observational studies. In such studies, a cascade is observed and then the (empirical)
likelihood that an agent with k infected neighbors becomes infected is reported. The
biggest problem is a form of selection bias: the nodes that have k-neighbors infected are
not a random set of nodes. It could be that (due to homophily3 ) nodes that are a priori
more likely to adopt, are also more likely to have many adopting neighbors. An
additional problem is that such studies typically assume that their view of the network
is complete and cannot account for information transmission that is likely to be
occurring along unobserved edges.
One way to overcome the aforementioned challenges is to run controlled
experiments, in which users are recruited and partitioned randomly into groups with
different treatments in which their neighbors’ attributes and behavior are specified by
the experimenters. Such experiments eliminate the selection bias of ties that form in
natural networks, allow the experimenter to control the network, and reduce other
confounding factors due to random assignment.

Literature on Charity Donation
Behavioral cascades operate in many decision-making contexts. In this work, we
chose to study charitable donation decisions with unfamiliar but deserving organizations
as targets, because we desired a task in which subjects made decisions about their own
money in a context of social information and no clear correct answer.
There has been much work looking into the mechanisms of charitable giving
decisions (Bekkers & Wiepking, 2011). Some characteristics affecting donation behavior
have been studied by data collection through surveys (Finkelstien, 2009; Lee & Chang,
2007). For example, it was shown that determinants affecting volunteering for charities

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

(donating time) are mostly intrinsic attributes while those for monetary donations are
mostly extrinsic (Lee & Chang, 2007). Personal attributes and characteristics were also
shown to correlate with the choice of charities (Bennett, 2003). Additional factors such
as the price, donation matching, or seed fund were studied as well (Gneezy, Gneezy,
Nelson, & Brown, 2010; Karlan & List, 2007; List & Lucking-Reiley, 2002).
In DellaVigna, List, and Malmendier (2012) the authors studied two possible
motivations to charitable giving: altruism and social pressure (people would rather not
give but dislike saying no). They demonstrated that at least some giving is driven by
social pressure. When a door-to-door fundraiser was altered so it was easy to avoid the
donation request, the number of contacts and total donations decreased.
The contagious behavior of charity donations was studied in Korolov et al. (2015)
in which the level of ‘chatter’ on Twitter and the amount of donation were compared.
The hypothesis was that people who donated may also tweet about it, and the tweets
may trigger other people to donate (who may remain silent), indicating a possibly
super-linear relationship of the chatter and the amount of donation received. By using
observational data, it was estimated that the amount of donation grows as a quadratic
function of activity levels on Twitter. However, the direction of causality cannot be
determined with correlational results. In a different study (Lacetera, Macis, & Mele,
2016), it was shown that broadcasting a pledge on social media is associated with more
pledges by a user’s contacts, but the subsequent boost in donation amount was
minimal. Although there was considerable activity in the forms of clicks and “likes,”
only a small number of donations (30 out of 6.4 million users reached) were made.
Our work contributes to the literature by demonstrating the contagious properties
of charity donation in a controlled experimental setting.
Hypotheses and Contributions
In this paper we ran experiments to test the following three hypotheses.
• Hypothesis I: Subjects will be influenced by their peers. That is, the more peers
give, the more likely the subjects will give.

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

9

• Hypothesis Ia: Peers who are perceived as similar will be more influential than
peers who are perceived as dissimilar.
• Hypothesis II: Contagions will be complex. That is, the influence curves will be
non-submodular.
To test these hypotheses, we designed and ran three experimental studies. In each
experiment, each participant was rewarded monetarily for answering 10 questions. They
were then asked if they wanted to donate a bonus payment to one of a given list of
charities. They were informed that they were put in a ‘group’ with others
simultaneously participating, and they observed what their groupmates (who were
actually bots that we controlled) did. Using this methodology, we could explore how
influenced subjects were by their network neighbors’ actions. In particular, we
manipulated the donation behaviors of the neighbors – specifically, we varied how many
neighbors donated to a charity, how many kept the money and how many chose a
particular charity that was otherwise disfavored.
We ran three experiments of minor variations in design, with a total of 4474
participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk. The main observations from the
experiments were the following. When more neighbors decide to donate (to any
charity), a subject is more likely to donate. Thus charity donation is indeed contagious.
This confirms Hypothesis I. In addition, when multiple neighbors decided to donate to
the same charity, the chance that a subject donated to that particular charity was
significantly lifted. Somewhat surprisingly, we did not find evidence that the influence
from neighbors who agreed with the participant in attributes/opinions was much
different from the influence from disagreeing neighbors. Thus we do not have evidence
to support Hypothesis Ia.
For Hypothesis II, we did not find evidence of complex contagion in whether or
not participants give. Yet, we do find consistent support for Hypothesis II in whether
participants give to a particular charity. We argue that complex contagion emerges
when the space of options is large causing the chance of any particular option being
adopted to be small, and social signals thus take on added salience. These findings are

of theoretical importance to understanding complex contagion and of practical
importance to organizations wishing to maximize donations.
Experiment A
Experiment A Methods
In this section, we present a full account of the protocol for the first experiment.
For subsequent experiments, we describe only the difference from the previous protocol.
The experiment protocol was approved by the Stony Brook University Institutional
Review Board.
The experiment was conducted online through Amazon Mechanical Turk.
Subjects interacted with a web application that presented the stimuli, recorded
responses and simulated behavior of other users. The experiment had four phases:
1. Personal preference questions;
2. Group formation;
3. Donation choice;
4. Survey and demographic questions.
The focal independent variables (Neighbor Similarity and Neighbor Donation Choices)
were delivered in Phase 2 and 3 and the dependent variable (Donation Choice)
measured in Phase 3.
Phase 1: Personal Preference Questions. The experiment began with ten
questions regarding personal preference. Each question had two possible answers, and
the subject had to choose one or the other. The experiment would not move on until an
option was selected in response to each question.
Our goal in this phase of the study was to set up the Similarity manipulation that
would occur in the next phase. Specifically, we aimed to make the subject feel that they
were similar to or different from their cohort of neighbors by first asking them about
their preferences and then manipulating to what degree their neighbors shared those

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

11

preferences. Because the “neighbors” were simulated, we could randomly assign
preference similarity.
We used 10 questions culled from online lists of good questions to ask when first
getting to know someone. For example, “Do you prefer books or movies?”, “Do you
prefer individual sports or team sports?” The full list of questions is included in the
appendix.
Phase 2: Group Formation. In this phase, the subject was told they were
being connected to other subjects to form a group. All subjects were told
• They would make a decision about donating a bonus payment in the next phase.
• They would be assigned to a group with three other participants.
• Their groupmates might or might not have answered the 10 questions similarly.
• The donation choices of their groupmates would be visible, but their own choice
would be private.
The Similarity manipulation was delivered at this point. The application populated the
groupmate slots with neighbors from one of two categories. Either all three neighbors
were labelled Low Similarity or all were labelled High Similarity. Low Similarity was
defined as “Less than 3 answers in common with you.” High Similarity was defined as
“More than 7 answers in common with you”. The neighbors were displayed as lettered
avatars (A,B,C). Figure 2 contains an example screenshot depicting Phase 2.
Phase 3: Donation Choice. In this phase, the Neighbor Donation Choices
treatment was delivered, and the subject made their donation decision. Specifically, the
subject was asked “Where would you like to donate?” and was presented with the
names of many charities. The charities were real and were selected by browsing online
databases of highly-rated charities. The subjects were promised $0.50 for participating
in the experiment and always paid at least this amount. Within the experiment they
were then told they had earned $0.60 and could choose to donate or keep the “bonus”
$0.10.

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

12

In the experiment, a list of 15 charities was displayed in a matrix with an
additional option to “Keep 10 cents and Do Not Donate.” The participants putative
groupmates’ decisions were revealed as the participant considered the options. To make
the neighbors appear more like real persons to the subject, the donation choices of the
neighbors were delayed in display with a random time duration. At approximately 5,
7.5 and 9 seconds after the screen loaded, a simulated neighbor made a charity decision.
(The exact times were randomly jittered up or down up to 1 second.)
The condition the subject was randomly assigned determined the neighbors’
donation choices. Of most interest was the number of neighbors who chose to donate to
the charity named Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI). 0, 1, 2 or all 3 neighbors
chose SCI, thus allowing a full characterization of the influence curve from no seeded
infection to complete infection.
The subject was required to make a choice before continuing. This choice is the
focal dependent variable. Figure 3 contains an example screenshot depicting Phase 3.
Phase 4: Survey and Demographic Questions. This phase included a short
set of demographic and survey questions which we felt might be useful in post-hoc
exploration of the experimental influence results. The questions followed the delivery of
the treatments and the collection of the dependent variable so as to not create any
demand characteristics within the experiment. Figure 4 contains an example screenshot
depicting Phase 4.

Experiment A Results
Basic Statistics. We recruited 1435 participants from Mechanical Turk and
assigned them randomly to 14 conditions (Table A1 in the Appendix) which specified
whether their neighbors were similar or dissimilar and what charity choices their
neighbors made. All three neighbors had the same similarity - either all High or all
Low. In addition to the Similarity variable, the conditions differed by the choices made
by the three neighbors: keeping the money to self (Self); donating to Schistosomiasis
Control Initiative (Schis), or donating to charities other than SCI chosen at random

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

13

without replacement (Rand). We continued recruiting subjects and assigning conditions
randomly until every condition contained at least 100 complete submissions.
We recorded whether the participants chose to keep the money and if the
participants decided to donate, which charity was chosen. Summary results are shown
in Table 1. As can be seen from the data, a majority of the participants (885 out of
1435, 61.67%) decided not to donate and kept the 10 cents. Generally speaking,
charities with easily-understood names received more donations. To illustrate, the top 3
charities are respectively Project Healthy Children, Centre for HIV and AIDS
Prevention Studies, and Global Fund to Fight AIDS. The bottom 3 charities are END
Fund, Deworm the World Initiative led by Evidence Action, and Measles and Rubella
Initiative. The Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, the charity we chose to highlight with
our experimental manipulation, received a donation from 30 participants - about 2.1%
of participants.

Testing for Social Influence (Hypothesis I)
We use our experiment to test Hypothesis I in two different ways. First, we
measured whether subjects who were exposed to neighbors that donated their 10 cents
bonus would also donate. Second, we measured whether subjects who were exposed to
neighbors that gave to the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI) would also donate to
SCI. SCI was chosen as the target charity for the influence manipulation because it was
among the least popular in a pilot test.
Influence for Donating versus Keeping. We first look at the fraction of
participants who chose to donate to any charity (i.e. chose any option other than Keep
10 cents and Do Not Donate), when they have 0, 1, 2, 3 neighbors who have chosen to
donate. Figure 5 (Top) shows the results. Clearly, the more neighbors donating, the
more likely a subject will donate.
Logistic regression. We ran logistic regression on the data. The dependent
variable is binary, with 1 denoting that the subject donated to a charity and 0 denoting
the subject chose Keep 10 cents and Do Not Donate. We define the independent

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

14

variables as the number of neighbors donating to a charity, the similarity of the
neighbors and an interaction. The coefficients and p-values of the logistic regression are
shown in Table 2. For the purpose of the present discussion, we point out that having
neighbors who donated to some charity clearly shows influence, with a p-value of 0.0275.
Influence for Donations to Schistosomiasis Control Initiative. Here we
look at the percentage of participants who chose to donate to SCI when they have
0, 1, 2, 3 neighbors who have donated to SCI. Figure 5 (Bottom) shows the results. As
can be seen from the data, the more neighbors who donate to SCI, the more likely a
participant will also donate to SCI. With no neighbors donating to SCI, only .48% of
the subjects chose to donate to SCI. With one, two, or three neighbors donating to SCI,
1.1%, 2.7%, and 5.4% of the subjects chose to donate to SCI. Thus, with three
neighbors the observed donation rate was over eleven times greater than the baseline
rate of choosing SCI in the absence of peers choosing it.
Again, we ran a logistic regression on the data (Table 3). The target variable is
binary, with 1 meaning that the subject donated to SCI and 0 otherwise. The logistic
regression points to a statistically significant effect for the number of neighbors choosing
SCI (p-value of 0.0053).
Hypothesis Ia. To test Hypothesis Ia we separated participants by those who
were presented with High Similarity (HS) neighbors and those with Low Similarity (LS)
neighbors. See Figure 6 (Left) for the influence curves for SCI.
The logistic regression included the Similarity treatment as an independent
variable. We focus on the interaction between neighbor similarity and neighbor
influence to evaluate Hypothesis Ia. If there was a negative interaction, this would
mean that LS neighbors have a weaker effect than HS neighbors. The interaction terms
are included in the regression both for donations in general (Table 2), and donations to
SCI in particular (Table 3).
Somewhat surprisingly, there is no discernible interaction effect. High and Low
Similarity neighbors have influence of similar direction and magnitude. Because we do
not find a reliable effect of this manipulation, we collapse across the Similarity variable

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

15

(HS and LS conditions) in our analyses.
Testing for Complex Contagion (Hypothesis II)
To test Hypothesis II, we seek evidence that the influence curve is
non-submodular. We evaluate this in two contexts: donating at all, and donating to a
specific charity.
Looking at Figure 5 (Top), there is no visual evidence of non-submodularity. It
appears the second or third donating neighbor is not substantially more effective than
the first in persuading a subject to donate. In contrast, in Figure 5 (Bottom) the visual
evidence suggests each additional neighbor exerted stronger influence than the previous,
indicating that the influence from having neighbors donating to SCI is non-submodular.
We fit the curve by a linear function and an exponential function to show the contrast.
Testing Significance. It is not a priori clear how to test if a function is
submodular. However, we might start by observing that a submodular function should
satisfy a suite of tests. Thus, a non-submodular function is one that violates one of
these tests. Here we formalize constraints that submodular functions shall satisfy.
Let P (i) be the probability of donating conditioned on being in a treatment were i
neighbors donate. If the influence curve is submodular, 5 different constraints should be
satisfied:
P (2) − P (1) ≤ P (1) − P (0)
P (3) − P (2) ≤ P (2) − P (1)
P (3) − P (2) ≤ P (1) − P (0)
P (3) − P (1) ≤ 2(P (1) − P (0))
2(P (3) − P (2)) ≤ P (2) − P (0)
Note that the last two constraints are implied by the first three. The difficulty in
translating this definition into a statistical test is correcting alpha for multiple
comparisons. Moreover, the tests share inputs and are likely to be correlated.
Fortunately, Chen and Szroeter (2009) provides a method to handle this
situation. Their procedure takes in multiple tests, and outputs the p-value of the event

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

16

that at least one of the tests is violated. To be precise, the null hypothesis is that none
of the tests are violated. The p-value then represents a bound on the probability of the
data, given that none of the tests are violated. The procedure explicitly takes into
account the covarience of the tests, and the paper includes a proof the test is
asymptotically exact. We provide details regarding our application of the procedure and
our calibrations with simulated data in the appendix.
For donating at all, the Chen-Szroeter test produces a p-value of 0.4667. For
donating to SCI, the Chen-Szroeter test produces a p-value of 0.186. We interpret this
as showing some support of non-submodularity in the case of SCI, though it is far from
conclusive.
Experiment A Discussion
In Experiment A, we found evidence that subjects respond to social influence.
Specifically, they are more likely to donate their bonus if they observe others do so, and
are more likely to choose a specific charity the more of their peers they observe choosing
that charity. In the case of donating to SCI, the shape of the influence curve appears
non-submodular - in other words, there are increasing returns to additional peers
choosing that charity, but a formal test provides only weak support this is a reliable
effect.
In the next experiment, we aimed to replicate these results. To probe the lack of
effect of the Similarity manipulation we made one change to increase its salience.
Experiment B
Experiment B Methods
Experiment B follows nearly the same design as Experiment A. However, we
selected new questions for Phase 1: Personal Preference Questions in order to increase
the salience of these items and move from a subtle manipulation of similarity to one
more intense. In Experiment A, Phase 1 contained ten getting-to-know-each-other
‘vanilla’ questions. In Experiment B, we substituted ten questions drawn from surveys

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

17

revealing politically polarized responses. For example, “Do you believe the United
States would be better if it were a more Christian nation?” The full list of questions is
included in the appendix.
We recruited 1443 participants from Mechanical Turk for this experiment,
partitioned in the same 14 conditions, with more than 100 participants per condition,
similar to Experiment A.
Experiment B Results
Summary results are shown in Table 4. Again, keeping the bonus and charities
with easily understood names were popular choices. The rank popularity of options
closely matches that of Experiment A.
Table 5 presents coefficient estimates for a logistic regression with donating to any
charity as the target variable. Just as in the previous results, subjects are more likely to
donate to any charity the more neighbors they see donating. There is no evidence the
strength of this effect is mediated by similarity.
Table 6 presents coefficient estimates for a logistic regression with donating to SCI
as the target variable. Subjects are more likely to donate to SCI the more neighbors
they see donating to SCI. There is no evidence the effect is mediated by similarity.
Figure 7 depicts influence curves for subject donation probability as a function of
donating neighbor count. The curve for donation to SCI is clearly non-submodular.
Visually, we show an exponential curve fits the data more closely than a line. Again we
ran the Chen-Szroeter test to measure the statistical significance of this result. The test
results in a p-value of 0.017. This shows strong evidence of non-submodularity.
Experiment B Discussion
The results of Experiment B were very similar to those for Experiment A.
Hypothesis I is strongly supported - subjects are more likely to donate and donate
specifically to SCI as the number of peers they are observing taking these actions
increases. Again, the data show no support for Hypothesis Ia. Despite our effort to
increase the salience and pertinence of the similarity manipulation by using politically

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

18

divisive questions, the effect of similarity and its possible interaction with the slope of
the influence curve are statistically indistinguishable from zero. Hypothesis II again
receives its strongest support in the context of donations to SCI. Subjects who observe
3 neighbors donate to SCI are 11 times more likely than subjects who observe none to
also donate to SCI, and the influence curve is non-submodular.
Experiment C
Experiment C Methods
In Experiment C we made additional changes to the experiment conditions.
1. Increased neighbors to 5. In Experiment A and B, only three neighbors were
presented to the participants. When three (out of three) neighbors donate to the
same charity, there are two manners in which this differs from two (out of three):
1) one additional neighbor donated and 2) now all neighbors have unanimously
made the same choice. Similarly, when two neighbors are observed making the
same choice, there is a conflation of two possible effects - a count of two and a
majority of the group. To separate the effects with minimal change, in Experiment
C we increased the count of neighbors to five, while only up to three donate to the
target charity. This is the key distinguishing feature of Experiment C.
2. Everyone donates. In Experiment A and B participants have the option of
keeping the 10 cents. In Experiment C, we removed the option of keeping the
money. Our goal was to increase statistical power.
3. Quiz on Group Phase Instructions. The participants must answer five True/False
questions regarding the Group Phase Instructions correctly before they were
allowed to move on. This was to make sure participants completely understand
the instructions.
4. New bot response timing. Due to the large number of neighbors in Experiment C,
the response time was chosen randomly from a uniform distribution over the range
[8000, 20000] milliseconds. This range covers over 80% of the empirically observed

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

19

response times from Experiments A and B. We use this larger range in response
times to avoid the neighbor choices clustering in a short, early interval. Without
this change, the neighbors responses appeared artificial to subjects, according to
feedback on an unused pilot set of subjects. Toward the same goal of presenting a
realistic experience of simultaneous users, we also informed the subjects that their
groupmates were deliberately chosen so as to all have high agreement or all have
high disagreement with them.
5. Emphasizing disagreement. In Experiment C, we continued with ten politically
polarized questions. We changed the wording subjects saw from “High Similarity”
to “High Agreement” and “Low Similarity" to “High Disagreement”. We again
hoped to increase the salience of the Similarity manipulation.
We ran Experiment C with 1596 participants from Mechanical Turk, randomly
assigned into 8 conditions: Similarity (High or Low) x SCI Neighbors (0, 1, 2, 3).
Experiment C Results
Because all participants in Experiment C donate, we only examine how many of
them donate to SCI. The results can be seen in Figure 8. When zero neighbors chose
SCI, only 0.24% of the participants donated to SCI, yet with 3 out of 5 neighbors
donating to SCI, the rate is elevated to 5.79%, which is 24 times greater. We fit the
influence curve by both a line (in blue) and an exponential (in red). The Chen-Szroeter
test returns a p-value of 0.21, indicating that violations of submodularity are more
likely than not.
Table 7 presents coefficient estimates for a logistic regression with donating to SCI
as the target variable. Subjects are more likely to donate to SCI the more neighbors
they see donating to SCI. There is no evidence the effect is mediated by similarity.
Experiment C Discussion
Again the data support Hypotheses I and II but not Ia. Participants are more
likely to donate to SCI the more neighbors they observe doing so, regardless of the

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

20

reported agreement in their answers to politically polarizing questions. The average
influence function would likely be non-submodular.
Exploratory Analysis - Who is more likely to donate?
Post-hoc, we explored the other recorded variables as predictors in larger models
predicting which subjects would donate rather than keep their bonus.
We find that:
• People who participated for fun are more likely to donate than people who came
for money, with a very small p-value (less than 0.00001).
• Females are more likely to donate than males, with a p-value of 0.0034.
• For the politically polarized questions in Experiment B and C, we observe that
certain questions show statistical significance on whether the subject will donate.
We also scored each the answer as liberal or conservative and summed the values
to form a scale from 0-10. The scale did not show a significant effect as a
predictor.
General Discussion
These results comport with and extend previous findings of social contagion. We
find that our subjects conform with the reported behaviors of others when choosing
whether or not to donate their earnings. We find that peer choices can powerfully direct
subjects to a particular charity (SCI) which is an otherwise unpopular option. Most
strikingly, we demonstrate complex contagion in a true randomized, controlled
experiment as evidenced by the non-submodularity of the influence curve for SCI
adoption in all three experiments (Figure 5, 7, 8). We calibrated and ran a test for
non-submodularity by adopting the methods of Chen and Szroeter. While the
significance of the non-submodularity was modest in Experiments A and C, Experiment
B found strong statistical evidence for non-submodularity.
These results should encourage further theoretical and experimental work
exploring complex contagion. We believe that characterizing influence curves as

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

21

submodular or not is a useful distinction. Complex contagions will reveal themselves as
non-submodular functions. We find some evidence for such when human subjects are
making otherwise unpopular (low base rate) decisions such as donating to a charity
with an obscure name, but not when subjects are making the the popular decision to
keep their money for themselves. This comports with previous theory - that complex
contagions should be observed for adoption of risky or unproven options, but further
research could more directly manipulate the perceived risk or baseline popularity of
available options.
In pilot testing, we found that binary decision formats (i.e. donate to SCI or do
not) were likely to result in linear influence curves. When we expanded the option
space, we observed the non-submodularity demonstrated in these results. This is an
important theoretical consideration. Most work on social contagion frames contagions
as binary: Did the doctor prescribe the new drug or not? Did the citizen vote or not?
The power of social information, however, may lie in the multiplicity of alternatives
inherent in real-life choices. Complex contagion may be better understood if behaviors
are re-contextualized from X or Not-X to choosing X from the broad array of all X and
non-X possibilities. A limitation of our results is that we cannot distinguish the effect of
number of options versus popularity of the target option prior to influence. Further
research which manipulates social signals in the context of decisions with varying
numbers of options would be valuable.
Practical guidance for maximizing donations to a particular charity also emerges
from these results. If naming or re-naming a charity, one should pick a name that is easy
to understand and has positive connotations. The most popular charity choices among
our subjects follow this rule - e.g. Project Healthy Children - and the least popular do
not - e.g. END Fund. Regardless of a charity’s name, “social proof” Cialdini (2007) is
a strategy that will increase propensity to donate. With the exception of gender and
the subject’s stated desire to make money, demographics and personal preferences were
weak predictors of donation behavior. In contrast, faceless avatars signalling the choices
of unknown individuals had powerful and compounding positive effects. The probability

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

22

a subject chose to donate to SCI jumped from between 0.2% − 0.5% to between
5% − 12.9% with three endorsements - a 10 − 20-fold increase. Soliciting donations with
social proof seems more likely to yield benefits than demographic targeting.
Future work should explore these practical considerations and the theoretical
importance of baseline popularity and option space size to complex contagion.

The Chen-Szroeter Test
Chen and Szroeter Chen and Szroeter (2009) develop a natural, computationally
efficient procedure that takes in multiple tests and outputs the p-value of the event that
at least one of the tests is violated. To be precise, the null hypothesis is that none the
tests are violated. The p-value then represents a bound on the probability of the data,
given that none the tests are violated. There procedure explicitly takes into account the
covarience of the tests. They prove that their test is asymptotically exact. That is, as
the number of data become large, the p-value approaches the correct value. The test is

based on a chaining argument, which we now briefly describe. Let µ1 , . . . , µ` be a set of
parameters in a model. The null hypothesis H0 states that µi ≥ 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ `. The
complement hypothesis H1 states that there exists an 1 ≤ i ≤ ` such that µi < 0. Let
D(·) : R → R be the indicator function such that D(x) = 1 if x < 0 and D(x) = 0
otherwise. We can then test H0 :

j=1

D(µi )µi = 0 versus H1 :

P`

D(µi )µi < 0. An

issue is that D has a large discontinuity at 0, but by replacing D with a series of
smoothed functions that point-wise converge to D the result is obtained.
Before we talk further about combining the tests, lets recall the individual tests
that should be satisfied.
Let P (i) be the probability of donating conditioned on being in a treatment were i
of your neighbors donate. The if the adoption curve is submodular, 5 different
constraints should be satisfied:
P (2) − P (1) ≤ P (1) − P (0)
P (3) − P (2) ≤ P (2) − P (1)
P (3) − P (2) ≤ P (1) − P (0)
P (3) − P (1) ≤ 2(P (1) − P (0))
2(P (3) − P (2)) ≤ P (2) − P (0)
If even one of these fails, then the function is non-submodular. We can easily rewrite
these in the form required by Chen and Szroeter’s chaining method. For example, let
µ1 = P (1) − P (0) − P (2) + P (1). Then µ1 ≥ 0 exactly when
P (2) − P (1) ≤ P (1) − P (0). This µi expression is often called a contrast. Here, the
contrasts are always in a special form called the ‘difference of differences’.
Given that the subjects are assumed to be independent, we have binomial
estimates P̂ (i) for the P (i). Thus, in the limit, the standard deviation of each contrast
µi is easy to estimate. For example, if we would like to test the contrast
C = P (i1 ) − P (i2 ) − P (i3 ) + P (i4 ) > 0. The variance of the contrast expression, when
i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 are all distinct, is
V =

P (ik )(1 − P (ik ))

where nik is the sample size of each treatment.
If we want to test whether µi > 0 individually, we form a test statistic by taking
√
the contrast divided by the standard deviation, i.e. C/ V . If the population contrast is
zero then this is approximately standard normal. We use a normal probability table to
construct a p-value or confidence interval (CI). Note that if any of the variables
i1 , i2 , i3 , i4 are the same, then we need to recalculate the variance. For example, the
variance of C = P (i1 ) − 2P (i2 ) + P (i4 ) > 0 would be
P (i1 )(1 − P (i2 )) P (i2 )(1 − P (i2 )) P (i3 )(1 − P (i3 ))

Using the Chen and Szroeter test, we can test of any of these constraint is
violated. We only need to compute the covarience between the test statistics, which is
just be the sum of the terms

P (ik )(1−P (ik )

that the tests have in common where ci1 and

ci2 are just the coefficients of the terms in each contrast.
The full details of how we implement the test are in section 3 of Chen and
Szroeter Chen and Szroeter (2009). We note that there are four different flavors of the
Chen test depending on what type of correction is used for multiple tests (either linear
or quadratic), and what type of error function is used around 0 (either a threshold or
soft-max). We find that these parameters did not make a noticeable difference, and
simply report the first ones mentioned in the paper–linear and threshold. There is also
a scaling parameter, which we conservatively set to the size of the smallest sample.
Calibrating the Chen and Szroeter Test. Formally, the paper shows that
this test is asymptotically accurate. That is, the test correctly outputs the probability
of the results conditioned on the null hypothesis being true (all tests tests are satisfied
by the model).
However, our data is not asymptotically large, so we ran a battery of tests on
finite data size, and found that the test performed surprisingly well for p-values in the
range of 0.05 and below. However, for larger p-values (e.g. 0.2), while the test
performed accurately for a large number of samples, the test was occasionally optimistic
on data from fewer samples. To test the method, we simulated our experiment being
run when for different values of the P (i)0 s. First, we found that, if the P (i)’s were

COMPLEX CONTAGIONS IN CHARITABLE DONATIONS

50

strictly non-submodular, the p-value would approach 1 as the number of simulated
samples in each treatment grew. If the P (i)’s were strictly non-submodular, the p-value
would approach 0.
One interesting case is where the P (i)s are linear. For example P (i) = .1 + i ∗ .1.
This is because, here all the test are just barely satisfied. In this case, we found that as
the number of samples increased, the probability of getting a p-values less than .05 was
strictly less than .05. For example, with the above P (i)s using 10,000 samples in each
treatment, out of 10,000 runs4 , only a 0.0201 fraction had p-values less than 0.05.
Moreover, for smaller samples, the probability of getting a p-value of less than .05 was
consistently around the same size or smaller than for larger samples. For example, using
the size of the first experiment with the above P (i)s the probability of getting a p-value
of less than .05 was 0.0204.
We tried one more type of test, where exactly one constraint was tight. For
example P (0) = .2, P (1) = .4, P (2) = .6 and P (3) = .7. Note here that
P (2) − P (1) = P (1) − P (0). In these cases, we found that the the fraction of
simulations with a p-value of less than 0.5 was approximately .0481 when simulating
10,000 samples in each treatment. When using the smaller sample that was actually run
in the test, this decreases to a 0.0062 fraction of runs having p-value at most 0.05.

we always use 10,000 samples and 10,000 runs unless we explicitly report otherwise
