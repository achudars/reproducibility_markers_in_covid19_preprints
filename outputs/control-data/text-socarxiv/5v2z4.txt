Significance
In 2017, over 70,000 Americans died from drug overdose, exceeding peak mortality from
HIV/AIDS, automobile accidents, and gun violence. Opioids are the leading cause of overdose
mortality, and more than 40% of opioid overdoses are attributable to prescription opioids. One of
the primary means of obtaining opioids is through “doctor shopping.” Although doctor-shopping
behavior is believed to cluster around a minority of prescribers, potentially due to information
sharing or cooperation, there has been no systematic and large-scale analysis. Here, we analyze a
large-scale prescription claims dataset and find that patient prominence in a co-prescription
network is highly predictive of adverse opioid outcomes, including overdose. Our results
highlight the importance of networks of patients and doctors in characterizing high-risk social
dynamics.
Abstract
This paper examines network prominence in a co-prescription network as an indicator of doctor
shopping (i.e., fraudulent solicitation of prescriptions from multiple healthcare providers) for
opioids. Using longitudinal data from a large commercially insured population, we construct a
network where a tie between patients was weighted by the number of shared opioid prescribers.
Given prior research suggesting that doctor shopping may be a social process, we hypothesize
that active doctor shoppers will occupy central structural positions in this network. We show that
network prominence, operationalized using PageRank, was associated with more opioid
prescriptions, higher predicted risk for dangerous morphine dosage, opioid overdose, and opioid
use disorder, controlling for number of prescribers and other variables. Moreover, as a patient’s
own prominence increased over time, so did their risk for these outcomes, compared to their own

2

average level of risk. These findings point to structural properties of co-prescription networks as
a promising indicator of social or strategic drug-seeking behavior and overdose risk.

Co-prescription network reveals social dynamics of opioid doctor shopping
Drug overdose was responsible for more than 70,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2017, making the
current drug epidemic the deadliest in history (Ahmad et al., 2018). The Centers for Disease
Control (CDC) reports that most drug overdose deaths involve an opioid, and in 2016, opioid
related overdose deaths were five times higher than in 1999 (Rudd, 2016). Prescription drug
abuse is an unmitigated public health crisis that has been developing for decades (Jalal et al.,
2018), despite increasing regulatory efforts. One of the primary means of obtaining prescription
opioids is through “doctor shopping” (Worley & Hall, 2012), or soliciting prescriptions for
controlled substances from multiple clinicians by over-reporting or manufacturing symptoms.
Among those with prescription drug dependence, nearly 40% are estimated to engage in doctor
shopping (SAMHSA, 2014). Moreover, compared to people who abuse prescription drugs but do
not shop doctors, doctor shoppers are more likely to experience drug-related hospital admission
(Jena et al., 2014), non-fatal opioid overdose (Hall et al., 2008), and opioid overdose fatalities
(Martyres et al., 2004; Peirce et al., 2012). Thus, doctor shopping is a critical mechanism that
contributes to opioid misuse trajectories (Hall et al. 2008).
In response to the increasing prevalence of prescription drug abuse and diversion, all fifty
states and Washington D.C. have created prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMPs) to
discourage doctor shopping and to reduce inappropriate prescribing and dispensing (McCarty et
al., 2018). While PDMP implementation has recently been associated with modest decreases in
rates of prescription opioid prescribing, diversion, and poisoning in some geographic areas,
evidence overall is mixed (Finley et al., 2017). Moreover, the U.S. continues to see increases in
opioid dependence and related morbidity and mortality (Ayres & Jalal, 2018; Pauly et al., 2018;
Reifler et al., 2012; Simeone, 2017). These findings suggest that although PDMPs may have

4

reduced egregious drug-seeking and prescribing behavior, they have not addressed opioid misuse
initiation and early patterns of abuse that fall short of detection criteria used to identify
fraudulent behavior.
Doctor shopping has historically been difficult to characterize (Simeone, 2017). A
common method of measurement uses multiple provider episodes (MPE), defined as obtaining
controlled substances from some minimum number of prescribers and/or pharmacies in a given
period of time. Although commonly used MPE thresholds have low false positive rates (Cepeda
et al., 2013; Hall et al., 2008; Wilsey et al., 2011), this approach is crude and may be overly
conservative. For example, people who engage in low levels of doctor shopping or those who
doctor shop heavily for a brief period are unlikely to be correctly classified. Therefore, it is
critical to explore alternative methods for characterizing prescription drug seeking behaviors to
facilitate early intervention and prevention.
Recent research suggests that social processes may be a critical element of doctor
shopping (Cepeda et al., 2013; Ong et al., 2016; Wortley & Thomas, 2014). First, doctor
shopping is clustered around particular at-risk prescribers. Doctor shoppers systematically seek
out physicians who are complicit, easily manipulated, or unlikely to monitor electronic data
(Worley, 2014). For instance, a previous study estimated that the majority of doctor shopping is
concentrated around 13% of clinicians who prescribed any opioids, and only about 2% of
prescribers were used by heavy doctor shoppers (Cepeda et al., 2013). Second, qualitative
research indicates that information about prescriber behavior is disseminated through social
networks (Worley & Thomas, 2014).
This line of research raises an important question: Do doctor shoppers occupy distinctive
structural positions in a network of patients and doctors? In particular, we hypothesize that

5

doctor shoppers — or high-risk individuals more generally — occupy central positions in the coprescription network, where patients are connected to other patients if they share the same
prescribers. First, by definition, they receive prescriptions from multiple prescribers and thus are
likely to be connected to many other patients through those prescribers. Second, their prescribers
tend to be at-risk prescribers who are targeted by other doctor shoppers. In other words, the
prescribers who are connected to a doctor shopper are probably more likely to be connected to
many other doctor shoppers. If doctor shoppers in isolation tend to occupy more central positions
in the network, then doctor shoppers are more likely to be connected to other central nodes (other
doctor shoppers), further strengthening the prominence of their structural positions. Third,
simply being at a central position in the network may reflect high-risk conditions, such as being
embedded in a social network of doctor shoppers or living in a community at risk for opioid
misuse.
We test the hypothesis that prominence in a co-prescription network of patients and
doctors is an indicator of opioid misuse and related adverse outcomes using a large claims
database of over 500,000 patients. Consistent with our expectations, we find that network
prominence is associated with number of opioid prescriptions and risk for high morphine dosage,
overdose, and opioid use disorder.

Results
Our dataset contains 526,929 patients who contributed 2,107,716 quarterly prescription
entries in 2016. In the patient co-prescription network, a tie between patients indicates that they
were prescribed one or more opioids (excluding medication-assisted treatment) by the same
prescriber. On average, each patient is connected to 29 other patients through opioid co-

6

prescription in the same 90-day period (see Table 1). However, the degree distribution is heavily
skewed and there are a small number of hub patients with very large degree (range: 0-1,178).
The mean number of opioid prescriptions per quarter is 1.26 and the mean number of opioid
prescribers is 0.59. About 8% of patients have high overdose potential (i.e., a max daily MME
greater than 90mg) in a given quarter, and 0.16% experience an opioid overdose.
- Table 1 Table 2 provides results from the regression of number of opioids prescribed per quarter
on PageRank percentile. Patients with higher PageRank are predicted to have higher numbers of
opioid prescriptions compared to those with lower PageRank, controlling for the number of
prescribers and other factors (See Model 1). A 1-percentile increase in between-person (BP)
PageRank is associated with a predicted 2% increase in the odds of obtaining an additional
opioid prescription (p<.001), adjusting for controls. Similarly, when patients have higher
PageRank than usual, they also obtain more prescriptions than is typical for them. A 1-percentile
increase in within-person (WP) PageRank over time is associated with a 1% increase in the odds
of having an additional opioid prescription (p<.001), even after controlling for the number of
opioid prescribers in a quarter.
- Table 2 Results from the regression of high overdose potential (>90mg maximum daily MME) on
PageRank percentile are provided in Model 2 of Table 2. Patients with higher average PageRank
are at higher risk for being prescribed dangerous doses of opioids compared to those with lower
PageRank. A 1-percentile increase in BP PageRank predicts a 7% higher odds of having a
maximum daily MME>90mg (p<.001). Also, as a patient’s own PageRank increases, so does
their predicted odds of high MME, controlling for number of prescribers and other control

7

variables. A 1-percentile increase in PageRank predicts a 2% increased odds of overdose over
time (p<.001).
Model 3 of Table 2 presents results from the regression of opioid overdose on PageRank
percentile. Higher average PageRank is associated with elevated risk of overdose compared to
patients with lower PageRank. A 1-percentile increase in BP PageRank predicts a 2% higher
odds of overdose (p<.001). Also, as a patient’s own PageRank increases, so does their predicted
odds of high MME, adjusting for number of prescribers and other control variables. A 1percentile increase in WP PageRank over time is estimated to increase overdose risk by 1%
(p<.001).
Finally, as shown in Model 4 (See Table 2), PageRank is associated with being diagnosed
with an opioid use disorder (OUD). A 1-percentile increase in average PageRank predicts a 7%
higher odds of OUD, comparing across patients (p<.001). At the same time, as a patient’s own
PageRank increases, so too does their risk for being diagnosed with OUD. A 1-percentile
increase in WP PageRank over time is associated with a 1% increase in the predicted odds of
OUD.
Predicted counts or probabilities of adverse opioid outcomes as a function of network
prominence are presented in Figures 1-4. As shown in Figure 1, patients with the lowest
PageRank are predicted to obtain an average of 0.768 (CI: 0.754-0.781) opioid prescriptions per
quarter, compared to 2.097 (CI: 2.082-2.112) opioid prescriptions among those with the highest
PageRank. Likewise, in quarters where a patient experiences an extreme decrease in PageRank
over time, they are predicted to obtain 0.430 (CI: 0.415-0.445) opioid prescriptions. In
comparison, following a large increase in PageRank, predicted number of prescriptions increases
to 2.103 (CI: 2.089-2.117).

8

- Figure 1 Predicted probabilities of maximum daily MME>90mg are presented in Figure 2.
Comparing across patients, those with the lowest PageRank have a predicted probability of only
0.027 (CI: 0.027-0.028) of dangerously high MME, compared to 0.185 (CI: 0.183-0.187) among
those in the most prominent network positions. There is a more pronounced effect of network
prominence between patients compared to within patients – a pattern consistent with the fairly
high correlation of observations within patients over time (ICC=0.82). That is, patients taking
high doses of opioids tend to continue taking them over time. Nonetheless, the predicted
probability of high MME ranges from 0.044 (CI: 0.043-0.045) when a person experiences a large
decrease in PageRank to 0.121 (CI: 0.120-0.123) in quarters when they experience the greatest
increase over time.
- Figure 2 Figure 3 presents predicted probabilities of opioid overdose. A patient with the lowest
PageRank has a predicted probability of overdose of 0.00077 (CI: 0.00070-0.00084) relative to
0.00305 (CI: 0.00281-0.00328) for those with the highest average PageRank. Over time, a
patient experiencing a large decrease in PageRank compared to usual is expected to have a
0.00089 (CI: 0.00075-0.00102) probability of overdose, while predicted probability of overdose
is 0.00262 (CI: 0.00229-0.00294) when increases in PageRank are very large.
- Figure 3 Finally, comparing across patients, those with the lowest PageRank have a predicted
probability of OUD of 0.0018 (CI: 0.0017-0.0019), compared to 0.0468 (CI: 0.0451-0.0485)
among those in the most prominent network positions (See Figure 4). Like high dosage
prescription regimens, OUD is highly correlated over time within patients (ICC=0.82).

9

Consequently, there is a more pronounced effect of network prominence between patients
compared to within patients. The predicted probability of receiving a diagnosis of OUD ranges
from 0.0080 (CI: 0.0076-0.0084) when a person experiences a large decrease in PageRank to
0.0155 (CI: 0.0149-0.0161) in quarters when they experience the greatest increase over time.

Conclusions
In this study, we examine whether structural position in a co-prescription network could
provide insight into high-risk drug-seeking. We find that patients in positions of prominence in a
co-prescription network disproportionately experience adverse opioid outcomes. Moreover, as a
patient’s own prominence increases over time, so does their risk for these outcomes, compared to
their own average level of risk. These results are consistent with a pattern of information sharing
among networked, drug-seeking patients about effective targets for doctor shopping (Worley &
Thomas, 2013), or localized prescription drug diversion coalitions (Inciardi et al., 2007).
Alternatively, observable attributes (e.g., being located in a pain clinic, being isolated from other
providers) may make particular prescribers vulnerable to doctor shopping, even in the absence of
direct information sharing.
Our findings have important implications for evolving social responses to policy change.
Specifically, relationships between network prominence and risk for opioid misuse and overdose
were not attributable to the sheer number of prescribers. Rather, in characterizing doctor
shopping behavior, which prescribers a patient targets (i.e., their relative network centrality) may
be as critical as how many. Supply-side interventions to reduce prescription drug misuse (e.g.,
prescription limits and guidelines, mandatory prescription monitoring, prescriber incentives to

10

reduce volume) have typically used the latter approach to measure and mitigate fraud and abuse
(Ali et al., 2017; Beletsky & Davis, 2017). Thus, cooperation and information sharing may
increasingly be essential strategies for procuring opioids in today’s policy environment. While
existing research has focused on the turn toward black-market alternatives to prescription opioids
(e.g., heroin, fentanyl; Alpert, Powell & Pacula, 2017; Cicero et al., 2014; Compton et al., 2016;
Martins et al., 2017), our findings highlight collaborative and calculated doctor shopping as
another potential behavioral response to supply-side interventions. If true, social network
analysis is likely to become an increasingly essential tool for characterizing prescription drug
misuse.
A limitation of our analysis is that social mechanisms underlying network structure are
not directly observed and must be inferred. However, it is reassuring that we are able to rule out
alternative explanations for network clustering, including cancer-related pain management,
shortages of licensed medication-assisted therapy (MAT) prescribers, type of insurance, and state
or county of residence. Also, because our data are derived from claims billed through
commercial insurance carriers, we are unable to observe cash transactions and Medicaid claims.
Since self-payment is a strategy for avoiding detection of doctor shopping behavior (Cepeda et
al., 2015), our findings may underestimate the effects of social network prominence.
In sum, while existing research suggests that social mechanisms facilitate doctor
shopping, we are aware of no prior large-scale analysis using social network methods to
characterize this behavior. These results are significant because they underscore the potential of
network approaches to improve measurement and expose social dynamics underlying the opioid
epidemic. Future research should explore these possibilities. For example, the predictive value of
social network indicators of doctor shopping should be tested against traditional measures for

11

identifying early and intermittent opioid misuse. A network approach might also be used to
identify social or geographic “hot spots” for intervention (e.g., increased harm reduction efforts)
or for early prediction of unmet substance abuse treatment need.

Methodology
We use deidentified health claims from a large commercially insured population of about 19
million patients for the period of June 2015 through December 2016. Data are observed quarterly
at the patient level and linked across administrative and health data. Patients are demographically
representative of the US population with respect to gender and age, and representative of the
commercially-insured population on all other measurable characteristics. However, because data
are observational and retrospective, statistical inferences and any related conclusions should be
made with caution.
We focus our study on the area most affected by the opioid crisis (CDC, 2017), the
Appalachian region of the US. While prescription opioid misuse is a nation-wide concern, the
Appalachian region of the United States has historically been the epicenter of the crisis (CDC,
2017; Dasgupta, Beletsky, & Ciccarone, 2018). High rates of opioid prescribing early in the
epidemic, economic stressors, and densely-knit social networks that facilitate drug diversion and
distribution contributed to prescription drug misuse and, later, heroin initiation and abuse in
Appalachia and other rural areas (Cicero et al., 2014; Harp & Havens, 2015; Keyes et al., 2014).
There is considerable disagreement about which states constitute Appalachia, with
geographic, cultural, and political definitions providing unique but overlapping boundaries.
Following Williams (2002), we use the core region comprised of six states that have been
included in the most influential government and scientific definitions of Appalachia – Georgia,

12

North Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, and West Virginia. Given its prominent status in
the opioid epidemic (including being the probable epicenter), we add a seventh state, Ohio,
which is included in the larger regional boundaries defined by the Appalachian Regional
Commission (ARC, 2018). To reduce the data to a manageable number of patients for SNA, we
restrict our analysis sample to patients in this seven-state region who received one or more
opioid prescriptions during the study period. Models using the larger ARC definition of
Appalachia yield substantively identical results, but are computationally inefficient. This process
results in a sample of 526,929 patients who contribute 2,107,716 quarterly observations.
To conduct SNA, we construct a patient co-prescription network in which a tie between
patients indicates that they were prescribed one or more opioids by the same prescriber (as
identified with a unique provider identification number). For this process, we omit opioid agents
used exclusively or primarily for medication assisted treatment (MAT; e.g., buprenorphine). This
strategy reduces concerns that network centrality measures were an artifice of network clustering
due to sparsely located MAT-licensed providers in medically underserved areas. Network ties
are undirected and weighted by the number of unique providers from which opioid coprescriptions (minus MATs) were obtained. For example, if Patient A and Patient B were
prescribed opioids by a set of the same three unique providers, the weight of their tie is three.
Ties are also pooled across three quarters (T-2, T-1, and T) to account for potential lags in
information diffusion and to offset the unnatural cut points imposed by quarterly observation.
Measures
The PageRank algorithm is used to measure each patient’s prominence or influence in the coprescription network. PageRank, originally developed to measure the importance of web pages
(Brin & Page 1998), roughly measures the probability that an actor who randomly traverses the

13

network through ties will arrive at a particular node. More specifically, PageRank is a stationary
probability distribution over all nodes in a network that satisfy the following equation:
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑖𝑖) =

𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑗𝑗)
1 − 𝑑𝑑
+d �
𝑁𝑁
𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜
𝑗𝑗∈𝑀𝑀(𝑖𝑖)

Where PR(i) is the PageRank of node i, d is a damping factor (d=0.85), M(i) is the set of the
nodes that have an edge pointing to i, 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the weight of the edge from j to i, and 𝑠𝑠𝑗𝑗𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜𝑜 is the

strength of node j (the sum of the weights from node j). In our case, the patient-patient network
does not have directed edges, and thus each undirected edge is treated as two directional edges.
Although PageRank is similar to Eigenvector centrality in that both measure prominence,
PageRank does not exhibit the critical localization problem of Eigenvector centrality (Martin et
al. 2014).
A patient with high PageRank is someone who received opioids from health professionals
who also prescribed opioids to other prominent patients (i.e., those with high PageRank). Note
that a patient could have low PageRank and still visit a large number of prescribers, as long as

those prescribers did not simultaneously provide opioids to many other prominent patients;
Conversely, a patient could have high PageRank and still visit a small number of prescribers
since PageRank takes into account the network positions of other nodes. The PageRank
algorithm outperforms other network measures (e.g., weighted degree centrality, eigenvector
centrality) in our multivariate models (results not shown). For the current analysis, we convert
the raw score for patient PageRank to a percentile value to address pronounced positive skew
and to increase the interpretability of PageRank. Sensitivity analyses using the logarithm of
PageRank and standardized PageRank yield substantively identical results. Additionally, we
decompose the variance in PageRank percentile into between-person and within-person
estimates, where BP is the person mean (i.e., the mean value across four quarters) and WP is the

14

difference between the current quarter and the person mean (see Analysis for justification).
We model four dependent variables. First, number of opioid prescriptions is a count of
the number of unique prescriptions for opioids obtained in a given quarter across all prescribers.
Second, overdose potential is measured using maximum daily morphine milligram equivalents
(MME). Daily MME is calculated by: 1) determining the total daily amount of each opioid
prescribed; 2) multiplying the dose for each opioid by the CDC conversion factor; and 3) totaling
MMEs for all prescriptions (Dowell et al., 2016). We then use the maximum daily MME during
a quarter to operationalize a patient’s highest risk for overdose. A binary variable is equal to 1
(else 0) if maximum daily MME is greater than 90 mg, consistent with CDC prescribing
guidelines defining this as the threshold for high overdose risk (Dowell et al., 2016). Third, drug
overdose is indexed using ICD-10 diagnostic codes for accidental drug poisoning in a given
quarter. We calculate a measure for accidental poisoning by opioids exclusively (including
synthetic opioids, e.g., fentanyl), and a separate measure that indexes poisoning by opioids or
“unspecified” drugs. Although findings are consistent, we present model results based on the
more inclusive measure. This decision is based on research suggesting that use of nonspecific
language to classify drug poisoning leads to overuse of the “unspecified” code and
undercounting of opioid overdoses (Lowder et al., 2018; Ruhm, 2018; Slavova et al., 2015).
Fourth, we create a binary indicator of opioid use disorder based on the presence of ICD-10
diagnostic codes for opioid abuse or dependence in a given quarter.
Our models also include a number of controls. We add gender (1=female; 0=male), age
in years, and type of insurance. The latter is coded into three binary categories representing the
most restrictive plans (health maintenance organizations, or HMOs), the least restrictive plans
(point of service plans, or POSs), and other plans falling between these on a continuum of

15

restrictiveness. Insurance plan is included to control for any patterns of health services utilization
(i.e., which specific prescribers were accessed) that are due to plan restrictions rather than social
network processes such as information sharing. To adjust for high opioid volume associated with
hospice care, which may be correlated with patient PageRank, we add a control for any cancer
diagnosis during the study period. Finally, because our intention is to capture the relational
pattern of drug seeking through prescribers rather than the sheer volume of doctor shopping, we
control for each patients’ number of unique prescribers in a given quarter. This ensures that any
effects of patient PageRank are attributable to the position of the node in a network of coprescription ties over and above any effect of visiting a large number of prescribers.
Analysis
Longitudinal analyses are conducted using multivariate mixed effects logistic and Poisson
regression models with random intercepts at the person level to adjust for correlation of
observations within patients over time. Models regress opioid use outcomes on network
prominence (i.e., PageRank percentile) and control variables. We employ variance
decomposition to model the effects of PageRank percentile on outcomes. The BP effect conveys
information about how a patient’s average network prominence is associated with their average
number of opioid prescriptions, for example, comparing across patients. The WP effect reflects
how being more or less prominent than usual is associated with obtaining a higher or lower
number of prescriptions than usual, comparing a patient to him or herself across quarters. The
latter estimate is analogous to a fixed effects model, and controls for all measured and
unmeasured heterogeneity at the patient level that is time invariant (Hoffman, 2015).
We also include state fixed effects to control for all unobserved heterogeneity at the state
level, reducing concerns about confounding effects of differences across states in PDMP

16

monitoring, prescription drug policies, and health care systems. Sensitivity analyses using United
States Post Office city groups (based on zip code) in lieu of state fixed effects produce identical
results. All models control for gender, age, type of insurance, any cancer diagnosis, and number
of unique opioid prescribers. Figures of predicted counts or probabilities are presented to convey
the magnitude of the effects. In figures, the y-axis range is set to +/-1 standard deviation.
