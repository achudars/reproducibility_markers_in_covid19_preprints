The Demography of Drug Abuse in Hong Kong

Tong Liu * Stuart Gietel-Basten †

Abstract
Drug abuse is a critical issue impairing social welfare in many societies. This study
explores the demographic characteristics of drug abuse among sub-populations in Hong
Kong as a developed and ageing society with large socioeconomic disparities. Significant
changes in both the number and rate of drug abuse by drug type, age, gender, ethnicity,
education and economic activity are documented during 1991 to 2016. Although narcotics
analgesics is more common, stimulants and Ketamine are growing popular in Hong Kong,
especially among the youth. The number of elderly drug abusers is increasing due to the
ageing population, whereas the rate of elderly drug abuse is actually stable or decreasing.
In contrast, drug abuse rate is increasing for the middle-aged and for groups with lower
education. The findings support social policy design to curb drug abuse, and call for closer
attention to these at-risk groups that are overlooked in Hong Kong.

1. Introduction
Drug abuse is a critical social issue in many societies worldwide. As a developed
economy with large economic disparities among an ageing population, Hong Kong has
been facing threats in illicit drug use over the past few decades of rapid development
(Cheung and Ch'ien, 1996). Numerous reports and news headlines show an intense
pressure in tackling drug deals on the supply side, as well as a growing prevalence of drug
use among young people on the demand side (Abdullah et al., 2002; Cheung and Cheung,
2006; Loxton et al., 2008). Addiction to drugs impairs health, work productivity, and
family relations in the long run, inducing severe social anxieties and costs (McGrath and
Chan, 2005; Shek et al., 2011).
Understanding the situation and trend in drug abuse is vital for social policies to
tackle the issue and improve social welfare. Specifically, it is important to determine the
rate of change and emergence of new at-risk groups relative to overall changes in the
population. These groups may include young adults, female drug abusers including
pregnant ones, ethnic minorities and sexual minorities. Taking into account the latest
demographic characteristics of drug abusers is crucial for developing social policies to
cater for their varying needs, which is highlighted as the first priority in Hong Kong’s
2017 Beat Drugs Fund call. 1
Clearly, this priority is a clarion call for the improved targeting of interventions
for groups who are at an increasing risk of drug abuse or who are increasingly falling
victim to drug abuse. In other words, this entails exploring whether the number of drug
abusers with characteristic x growing more quickly or slowly than the population as a
whole with characteristic x. It is only when we compare the absolute changes in numbers
1

1

to overall trends in that population group as a whole can we determine the rate and hence
the true extent of changes over time. For example, Hong Kong has one of the most rapidly
ageing populations in the world. As such, any increase in the number of older drug abusers
would have to be cross-referenced with this population-level change in order to examine
the true nature of the trend. Furthermore, there are various social and economic
determinants of drug use in Hong Kong (Wu et al., 2014) and elsewhere. As such, it is
important to gain a multi-dimensional understanding of the demography of drug abuse in
order to design more effective and targeted interventions. Such an improved identification
of trends over time will allow for a more accurate representation of trends in reported
drug abuse through rates rather than relying on absolute numbers.
However, the extent to which this 'reference to the demographic characteristics of
the overall population' has been made in either published reports or the scholarly literature
has since been weak. For instance, there were 72 studies supported by the Hong Kong
government during 1995-2014, among which 11 reports investigated the trends in number
of drug abusers; 30 examined the characteristics of abusers and the role of education; 14
studies evaluated rehabilitation programs; 9 surveyed on public opinion, and 8 studies
explored the consequences of drug abuse. In general, there is a lack of study on the
changes in drug use rate among different groups. The only reference to the overall
population and the irregular Census and Statistics Department 'Feature Articles' is a
simple single-year 'Ratio of reported drug abusers to population' (Narcotics Division,
2016). A PubMed search of 'central registry of drug abuse' yields 125 articles, only three
studies of which are concerned with the exploration of demographic trends in drug use
over time (Cheung and Ch'ien, 1996; Lee et al., 1998; Smart and Murray, 1983). None,
however, performs anything akin to a comprehensive analysis of trends and all are at least

2

two decades old. There is currently no comprehensive published demographic study of
trends in rates of drug abuse in Hong Kong, or in a comparative context. Indeed, owing
to data availability, only a handful of 'demographics of drug use' have been published in
the literature - most notably the study of drug use in the United States by Kandel (1991).
This paper examines trends in drug abuse in Hong Kong. We aim to construct a
'demography of drug abuse' for Hong Kong, which will identify changes in rates of
(different types of) drug abuse by various socioeconomic, geographic and demographic
characteristics. This will lay the foundation of future identification of key determinants
of drug abuse, and will further support the design and implementation of social policies
in tacking drug abuse.

2. Materials and Methods
2.1 Drug Abuse
Our evidence for understanding the emerging at-risk groups is generally derived from the
Central Registry of Drug Abuse (CRDA) at Narcotics Division (ND) in Hong Kong.
Since 1972, the CRDA has been the primary source of drug abuse statistics for the Hong
Kong government and other key stakeholders (Wat, 1985). The goal of the CRDA has
been variously stated but is encapsulated in a report by Legislative Council of Hong Kong
(LegCo) as 'facilitating the planning of anti-drug strategies and drug abuse programmes
in Hong Kong' (Legislative Council Secretariat, 2009). A primary reason for designing
and maintaining the CRDA is to examine changes over time in patterns of drug use. A
2009 iteration of the 'Not Now, Not Ever' drugs campaign led by the then Chief
Executive's office highlighted that 'by analysing the statistics and formulating trends of

3

drug use, the Government is able to more effectively target resources and formulate
programmes to tackle drug abuse'. 2
Over the past decades, CRDA Reports based on the registry have rightly been the
primary source of drug abuse data for both stakeholders and the media (see Narcotics
Division, 2016 for the latest report). In addition to this, the Census and Statistics
Department has published 'Feature Articles' on the Drug Situation in Hong Kong at
irregular intervals, again utilizing the aforementioned CRDA and other data courses
(Census and Statistics Department, 2016).
There are 65 reporting agencies in the CRDA system. The reporting agencies
include Drug Addiction Treatment Centre of Correctional Services Department, Hong
Kong Police Force, Methadone Treatment Programme under Department of Health,
Social

Welfare

Department,

Substance

Abuse

Clinics

under

Hospital

Authority/Hospitals/Clinics, Non-government Organizations (NGOs) (such as Drug
Treatment and Rehabilitation Centres, Out-Reaching Teams/Integrated Services Centres,
Counselling Centres for Psychotropic Substance Abusers (CCPSA), Centres for Drug
Counselling) and schools.
CRDA contains detailed information on age, gender, ethnicity, education,
economic activity, district of residence of each individual drug abuser. The illicit drugs
can be categorized as narcotics analgesics, stimulants, depressants, tranquillizers,
sedatives/hypnotics, hallucinogens, or other drugs. Narcotics analgesics include Opium,
heroin, Fentanyl, Pentazocine, Tilidate or Tilidine. Stimulants include Amphetamines,
Cocaine, Methamphetamine and anti-depressants. Depressants include Quinalbarbitone,
Methaqualone, Meprobamate. Other drugs mainly include Ketamine.

Each drug abuser has a unique case number to trace the identity in CRDA data.
Some abusers were repeatedly reported by multiple organizations within a year or
consecutively over the years, resulting in 666,665 observations of abuse cases in total.
We drop the repetitions in reporting within a year. Overall, there were 98,016 drug
abusers reported during 1991 to 2016 in Hong Kong.
2.2 Census
The Hong Kong Census data covers the 5% population in 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, 2011
and 2016. Key information includes age, gender, education, economic activity, district of
residence and ethnicity, allowing us to recode the information and match it with the
CRDA data.

2.3 Methods
The construction of a 'demography of drug abuse' requires the systematic crossexamination of evidence relating to drug abuse (as the numerator) to Census data (as the
denominator). This involves the examination of rates of drug abuse (including different
types and categories of drug) according to age, gender, ethnicity, education, economic
activity and so on.
Specifically, we first explore trends of drug abuse in the CRDA data. Then, we
compare them to Census data. As the Census data is only gathered (in effect) every five
years, we first interpolate the Census data linearly to obtain annual estimates of
population in-between each census point during 1991 and 2016. The population data are
then matched with CRDA drug data by year and demographic characteristics, allowing
for calculating the rate of drug abuse by these groups. We then examine the changes in
numbers and rates of drug abusers in Hong Kong.

3. Results
3.1 Number of Drug Abusers
Table 1 summarizes the characteristics of drug abusers in Hong Kong in 1991, 1996, 2001,
2006, 2011 and 2016. In general, most of drug abusers in Hong Kong are Chinese males
between 20 to 50 years old, especially the young people. They are not well educated and
are likely to be unemployed, with educational attainment below secondary schooling.
This depicts the low-income group in Hong Kong. Many of them live in districts with
more population density and crime such as Sham Shui Po, Kwun Tong and Yau Tsim
Mong, or remote areas such as Yuen Long (as shown later).
The most popular drugs are narcotics analgesics, stimulants and Ketamine.
Tranquillizers and hallucinogens are less popular in Hong Kong, contributing only 5.3%
of the total abusers. The popularities of drugs are different between Hong Kong and other
countries, as hallucinogens are common but Ketamine are not in the western countries.
Depressants, sedatives or hypnotics are totally unpopular in Hong Kong.
[Table 1]
Figure 1 plots the number of drug abusers in Hong Kong during 1991 to 2016.
There is a declining trend of drug abuse in Hong Kong over the years. However, there are
three major waves with peaks in 1994, 2001 and 2008. The saddle points are in 1992,
1999 and 2006. In these three waves, the number of drug abuse cases would keep
increasing for the first two years and then would decline continuously for five years. We
also observe a gender difference in that most (80%) drug abusers are male, and it is the
males driving the patterns in drug abuse, while female addiction cases are substantially
smaller with a general inverted-U shape. If we further differentiate between newly
reported cases with previous ones, the fluctuations in total tolls are seemingly driven by

6

new cases each year (as shown by the green dashed line), while there is a continuous
decline for the previously reported cases.
[Figure 1]
The patterns in Figure 1 are likely related with changes in drug demand in Hong
Kong, given the consistent efforts by the police department in tackling drug supply. For
example, the abuse of ecstasy soared since the year 2000 along with the burgeoning rave
party scene in Hong Kong (Narcotics Division, 2011). The consistent drop in the number
of reported drug abusers after 2008 is possibly related with the drop in drug demand due
to more attention and efforts from the government and NGOs. For instance, a high-level
inter-departmental task force, led by the Secretary for Justice, was set up in October 2007
to spearhead government efforts to tackle youth drug abuse. 3 The ND also commissioned
NGOs to provide drug education programs to students from Primary Four to secondary
level.
3.2 Distribution by District
Figure 2 shows the spatial distribution of drug abusers in Hong Kong. A substantial
number of drug abusers live in relatively poor regions with higher population density
including Sham Shui Po and Yau Tsim Mong. These regions have many tourists and
prostitutes. Drug abusers are also more likely to reside in remote areas with high criminal
records, such as Yuen Lung and Tuen Mun. In addition, the number of drug abuse is low
in more developed commercial regions on Hong Kong Island, such as Central and Wan
Chai. More bars are located in this areas, offering alcohol as a substitute for drugs. These
observations are consistent with previous findings on the relationship between drug abuse,
education and economic activity (Bachman et al., 2007).

In general, the number of drug abusers was declining in these hotspots and other
districts universally after 2001, as shown by Table 2.
[Figure 2]
[Table 2]
3.3 Rate of Drug Abuse
The number of drug abusers offer an overall picture on the drug abuse situation in Hong
Kong. This section further explores the demographic patterns of drug abuse in detail with
a focus on rate of drug abuse, which is defined as the number of drug abusers per 10,000
people for each demographic category.
3.3.1 Drug type
The number of narcotics analgesics abusers has been decreasing for ages below 50 since
1996, as shown by the blue (age 20-30), green (age 30-40) and yellow (age 40-50) lines
the left panel of Figure 3a. Similarly, the rate of these drug abusers continuously dropped,
as shown by the right panel of Figure 3a. However, the percentage changes in rates are
larger than the percentage changes in absolute numbers. This reveals the changes in
population structure by age, as the cohort of young people is shrinking due to the ageing
population. Before 2006, although the absolute number of drug abusers at 50-60 was
growing, the rate of drug abuse remained steady, reflecting that the changes in absolute
numbers were mainly due to an increasing population at 50-60. Similarly, more elderly
people between 60 and 70 were reported to take narcotics analgesics in the recent decade
(shown by the left panel of Figure 3a). If we consider the ageing of population, however,
the ratio of these abusers over total number of abusers at 60-70 remain flat, as shown by
the orange line in the right panel of Figure 3a. Similarly, the number remained stable for
people above 70, but the ratio was decreasing due to the growth in population in this

8

group. This shows that the increase in number of elderly people taking narcotics
analgesics is simply caused by the population structure change rather than that more
people in the same cohort above 60 begin to take drugs. In other words, elderly people
are unlikely to be newly addicted to drugs.
In Figure 3b, we observe an increasing trend in both absolute number and rate of
people taking stimulants above 20 years old, while the elderly people do not prefer
stimulants. The number and rate of abusers below 20 years old peaked in 2000 and 2005,
and were continuously dropping afterwards, revealing significant regulatory efforts by
the government and other organizations targeted at the youth and students in recent years.
Besides narcotics analgesics and stimulants, most of other drugs is Ketamine,
which is prevalent among the youth and middle-aged group. Particularly, the youth has a
large share of ketamine abuse (there were over 3,800 ketamine abusers between 10 and
30 years old in 2009). The changes in numbers and trends are different between the youth
and middle-aged groups. An increasing number and proportion of people between 30-50
are taking Ketamine during the past 25 years, but the popularity among people between
10-30 was declining since 2009. Again, this may be due to more regulatory and
educational efforts in response to the raising alarm of youth taking Ketamine before 2009.
In addition, although there were more Ketamine abusers at age 20-30 than those at age
10-20 in 2008 and 2009, the rates of Ketamine abusers at age 20-30 were lower
correspondingly (as shown by the peaks in Figure 3c).
Tranquillizers, depressants, hallucinogens, sedatives/hypnotics are unpopular in
Hong Kong. Still, we observe heterogeneous patterns in these drugs across different agegroups in Figure 3d and Figure 3e. For instance, tranquillizer abusers show an invertedU shape, with an increasing trend before 2006 and a decreasing trend after 2006.

9

Particularly for the age group between 40 and 50 years old, although the absolute number
of abusers is relatively stable during 2008 to 2016, the rate of tranquillizer abusers
actually increased slightly. This suggests that the middle-aged people are likely to be
newly addicted to tranquillizers.
The number and ratio of hallucinogen abusers declined among young people
below 30 years old, but are increasing for the middle-aged group between 30 and 50. This
may be related with large pressure from work and life for the middle-aged people, who
also have higher income compared with the young and the elderly. Cannabis and lysergic
acid diethylamide (LSD) are less additive and may cause less harm to them compared
with narcotics analgesics and stimulants, therefore the associated costs may be lower for
them.
[Figure 3]
3.3.2 Age and Gender
Over 80% of drug abusers are males, and around 50% of abusers are between 20 and 40
years old. Although female drug abusers are small in number, the percentage share
followed an inverted-U curve, rising from 8.4% in 1991 to 19.2% in 2006, and then
dropped slightly to 18.1% in 2016.
Figure 4 further picks the age groups of 10-20, 40-50 and 60-70 in the three rows,
and compares males on the left panel with females on the right panel. We choose the
newly reported cases only to follow the drug abuse changes. The dark solid lines represent
total number of drug abusers, and the blue solid lines denote the ratio of drug abusers per
10,000 people. First, as shown by the first row of Figure 4, young people are very
responsive in drug abuse, who were driving the peaks in 1994, 2001 and 2008. They
contribute to most of the newly reported cases, suggesting that the young people are more

10

vulnerable in terms of taking drugs. As shown by previous studies, peer influence, relief
of boredom/depression/anxiety, and curiosity are the top three reasons for illicit drug use
(Lam et al., 2011). The total number and rate of young drug abusers are rather parallel.
Second, a further investigation by age group reveals a continuous increase in
newly reported females between 40 to 50 years old, as shown by the second row of Figure
4. The changes in rates is more significant than the total numbers during 2011 to 2016,
revealing less growth in female population in comparison with the population of female
abusers. In comparison, newly reported male abusers between 40 to 50 years old show
milder increase with more fluctuations in recent 10 years. This reduces the gaps in
numbers of drug abusers between males and females in the middle-aged group, from the
gender ratio of 5:1 in 1991 to nearly 2:1 in 2016. The findings reveal a growing concern
over drug addiction among the middle-aged group in Hong Kong nowadays. It may be
related with more economic social pressure for this group in the past years.
Lastly, the third row of Figure 4 chooses people aged between 60 to 70 as
representative of the elderly. The number of newly reported elderly male abusers is
declining during 1991 to 2006 but remain stable ever after. In contrast, elderly female
drug abusers are small in number and remain relatively stable over the years.
[Figure 4]
Figure 5 plots the age and gender distribution of overall drug-abuse population
per 10,000 people in Hong Kong in each Census year. First, the male drug abuse rate is
much higher than females almost at all ages. In particular, most of the elderly above 50
are males. The rates of male abusers at age 20-24 were over 160 per 10,000 people
between 1996 to 2001. As for 2001-2011, the ratio of female abusers at age 10-14 is
higher than that of males. This reveals a rising popularity of drugs, mostly Ketamine,

11

among the youth during this period. Second, the changes in drug population structure
between sexes are similar over the years. For instance, the ratio of drug abusers below 15
years old experienced an increase from 1991 to 2001, and then kept declining after 2001
for both males and females. The drug abuse rate of the elderly above 60 consecutively
decreased. The changes in rate of middle aged drug abusers at 30-50 were small after
2001. Overall, the shapes of drug population distribution are similar in 1991 and 2016,
with more drops in males at all ages than in females. Many new male abusers at age 2024 were reported in 1996 and 2001. Female distribution follows the shape of pyramids
during 1996-2006, with most females at age 15-19 across different age cohorts, exceeding
30 abusers per 10,000 people.
[Figure 5]
3.3.3 Ethnicity
Most of the reported drug abusers in Hong Kong are Chinese, including Hong Kong local
residents and residents in Mainland China. However, their share was continuously
decreasing from 95.5% in 1996 to 88.9% in 2016. This reflects an increase in migration
of people with other ethnicities. In particular, the number of drug abusers is growing for
immigrants from South Asia, including Nepal, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri
Lankan. Despite the small numbers, they are increasing rapidly and impose a potential
threat on the Hong Kong society. These minorities are more likely to be unemployed and
may involve in illicit drug dealing. They also face high social pressure, which could
increase the likelihood of taking drugs.
3.3.4 Education and Economic Activity
Most of drug abusers have lower or upper secondary education, taking up around 70% of
the total drug abusers (as shown by Table 1). Nearly 20% of drug abusers receive primary

12

education only. We select the age-group at 40-50 to construct the rate of drug abusers by
education in this group, as their educational attainment is likely stable. Figure 6 plots the
number and ratio of drug abusers with primary, lower-secondary, upper-secondary and
tertiary education in each row, respectively. Males and females are plotted separately on
the left and right column, respectively. We observe a decreasing trend in the number of
drug abusers among groups with low-education attainment at primary levels during the
past decade. However, the rate of drug abuse for males with primary education is inclining,
while female drug abuse rate was declining but increased in 2014. In contrast, the number
and ratio of middle-education (lower secondary and upper secondary education) abusers
were both increasing. The high-education group with tertiary education remains
quantitatively stable over the years. Since higher education is positively correlated with
higher income and social status, the drug abuse rate among well-educated people shall be
typically lower than that in less educated groups. The increase in middle-education
abusers suggests that the social pressure is spreading upward the social hierarchy. These
pressures may be related with rising house prices and competition in the labor market,
leaving the middle-education group more depressed. The results are consistent with
previous empirical and theoretical analyses (Becker and Murphy, 1988).
[Figure 6]
Economic activity and education are two sides of the same coin. Over half of drug
abusers are unemployed or part-time workers. Still, around one third of them are full-time
workers, but the rate has been decreasing over the years. The rate of unemployed drug
abusers was increasing during 1991 to 2006, and were declining ever after. Part-time
workers are becoming more likely to take drugs in Hong Kong.

13

4. Discussion
Our analyses rest on two fundamental assumptions regarding the completeness of data in
both the CRDA and the Census. First, the quality of CRDA data is generally good.
Although there have been criticisms of the CRDA data (Siu, 2015), the under-reporting
ratio is expected to be low. For instance, for the years 2008 and 2009, the ratios of nonreported abusers to reported abusers were 9.7% and 7.8% respectively (Narcotics
Division, 2011). Notably, the CRDA data conform to recent scientific studies using
wastewater analysis to measure drug use in Hong Kong (Lai et al., 2013). Nevertheless,
there is a threat to construct validity (Cook et al., 2002) inasmuch as what is termed 'drug
abuser' in this context is in fact the narrower definition of someone who has been
registered in the CRDA. As such, we shall be careful in our interpretations to avoid
sweeping statements based on what will inevitably be only a partial representation of drug
abusers in Hong Kong. Second, there is no reason to suggest that systematic bias exists
in under-reporting of particular groups in the CRDA. Therefore, it will not bias our
comparisons across different groups.
As with all analyses of rates and determinants, there is a potential threat to
statistical conclusion validity. First, the extrapolation between census points may
potentially skew the 'population' under analysis. Second, while the CRDA covers a large
sample, any exploration of intermediate level rates and subsequent analyses are likely to
quickly become beset by the small number problem and hence lose statistical significance.
Hence, we avoid large number of small categories in demography and only focus on
bigger divisions and their combinations.

14

5. Conclusion
There is an urgent need to understand the demography of drug abusers by estimating the
true drug use rates among sub-populations in Hong Kong. Essentially, identifying the
trends and determinants of drug use will enable social policies to target resources to tackle
drug use more effectively, particularly to prevent drug use at an early stage.
We find that stimulants and Ketamine are growing popular among the young and
middle-aged group in Hong Kong during 1991 to 2016. Given the ageing population,
although the number of drug abusers is increasing among the elderly, the rate of drug
abuse is stable or decreasing for the elderly group. By contrast, the number and rate of
drug abuse is increasing for the middle-aged and for people with medium-level of
education (secondary schooling). On average, higher rate of drug abuse is likely
associated with lower education and lower income.
Our findings detail a careful profile of the drug-abusing population of Hong Kong.
This allows relevant stakeholders to gain a more accurate picture of the 'demography of
drug abuse' in Hong Kong. In particular, the drug use among youth has been a focus in
the past, whereas the middle-aged and less-educated people received limited policy
attention. The findings can further contribute to both more effective interventions in terms
of prevention and catering for their varying needs, including but not limited to peer
snowballing, closer collaboration with parties in contact with drug abusers in their
services for case referral, etc. Future studies could analyze the determinants of drug use
in Hong Kong based on the data and findings.
