"4" "This study investigat es the   association  between  individual-level  characteristics   and the risk of having an unmet need for contraception  in the United States between 2002 and 2017  for women who were sexually active, not pregnant or postpartum, fecund, and wanted no more children .  Using data from the National Survey of Family Growth, logistic regression models are used to estimate the association between demographic, socioeconomic, and reproductive characteristics and the probability of having an unmet need for any contraception and for modern methods.  The results show that 6.8%  of the women at risk did   not  us e  any form of contraception and 12.1%  did  not us e  any modern method. Women  who were  black, Catholic, insured by Medicaid  or uninsured , nulliparous, and who had not used contraception at their first sex  had the  greatest  odds of having an unmet need , suggesting that specific groups are disproportionately vulnerable to unwanted pregnancy  in the United States ."

"6" "INTRODUCTION"
"7" "Nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended  (Finer and Zolna 2016) , and these can have significant implications for health and socioeconomic outcomes  of women and children .  Women experiencing unintended pregnancy are slower to obtain antenatal care  (Kost, Landry, and Darroch 1998b) ,  more likely to experience preterm birth  or low birth weight   (Mohllajee et al. 2007, Kost and Lindberg 2015) ,  less likely to breastfeed  (Korenman, Kaestner, and Joyce 2002) ,  and have higher rates of postpartum depression  (Mercier et al. 2013, Barber, Axinn, and Thornton 1999) ."
"8" "U nintended pregnancy can result from either contraceptive failure/misuse or the absence of contraception entirely.   In the United States, the latter is the predominant proximate cause of unintended pregnancy.   In 2001, 60% of unintended births  and 52% of unintended pregnancies  were conceived during a month in which a woman used no contraception   (Finer and Henshaw 2007) .   Unintended pregnancies can be decomposed into those that are mistimed, but wanted, and those that are completely unwanted.  The difference between these is not purely academic, as women having unwanted births are less likely to breastfeed and more likely to experience premature birth  than those that had  only  mistimed births   (Dye et al. 1997, Kost, Landry, and Darroch 1998a, Mohllajee et al. 2007) .  Furthermore,  some  evidence  suggests that there may also be important socioeconomic consequences of unwanted childbearing. A recent study  has shown   that women with unwanted pregnancies who were barred from having an abortion due to gestational limits were , even four years after denial,  more likely to be in poverty, less likely to be employed, and more likely to receive public assistance than women who were able to have an abortion  (Foster et al. 2018) .  Beyond its health implications, un want ed pregnancy may therefore  also reinforce existing socioeconomic inequalities in health and other outcomes, as rates of unintended pregnancy are disproportionately higher among poor, low-educated, and  black  women  (Finer and Zolna 2016) ."
"9" "When a woman is at risk of pregnancy, but does not use contraception, despite having no desire for future childbearing, she is considered to have an unmet need  for contraception   (Cleland, Harbison, and Shah 2014) .  While  many  studies have investigated the  factors associated with  contraceptive use and non-use in the United States  (e.g. Daniels and Abma 2018, Dehlendorf et al. 2014, Frost and Darroch 2008, Frost, Singh, and Finer 2007, Kavanaugh and Jerman 2018, Mosher, Jones, and Abma 2015) , there is  much less  research examining variation in  unmet need within this context   (see Grady et al. 2015, Wu et al. 2008, Upson et al. 2010) .   The key distinction here is that studies focusing simply on contraceptive use typically have not incorporated women’s subjective views of whether or not they wish to become pregnant. Taking women’s fertility desires into account allows us to distinguish between those at risk of an unintended pregnancy from those at risk of an unwanted pregnancy  and provides a broad metric of reproductive autonomy in a society ."
"10" "Understanding disparities in unmet need in the United States is becoming increasingly important . G roups that have higher rates of unwanted pregnancy , such as poor, low-educated, and minority women,  also have been shown to rely more heavily on induced abortion  for regulating family size  (Jones and Jerman 2017) . Y et recent proposals from the government aim to greatly restrict the availability of abortion services by altering regulations relating to Title X, a federal funding program designed in part to cover family planning costs of low-income and uninsured individuals  (Janiak, O’Donnell, and Holt 2018) .  In this vein, it is of special importance to understan d   disparities  in unmet need for  highly-effective  modern contraception, as modern  contraceptive prevalence has been shown to be strongly negatively correlated to national abortion rates  (Westoff 2008) .  It is therefore crucial that we understand who are the most  susceptible  to unwanted pregnancy."
"11" "The aim of this study is to  document  socioeconomic and demographic  variation in unmet need in the United States between 2002 and 2017  for women aged 15-44 .    Nationally representative d ata from the last five waves of the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) are used to  calculate the percentage of women who were fecund, sexually active, and  wanted no (more) children who  were not using contraception in the month preceding the survey .   Then, l ogistic regressions are used to estimate the adjusted odds of having an unmet need for any contraception and an unmet need for modern contraception according to socioeconomic  and demographic  characteristics and previous  reproductive behavior ."
"12" "This study contributes to the literature on unmet need in several ways. First, it is one of the few to focus on a low-fertility population  in a developed country .  Most research on unmet need has focused on developing countries, but there is evidence that the gap in unmet need between developed and many less-developed countries is not large  (Alkema et al. 2013) .  Furthermore, d espite high levels of unintended  pregnancy  in the United States  and internationally  (Singh, Sedgh, and Hussain 2010) , we have little understanding of how unmet need may contribute to these patterns  in developed countries . Second, it is among the first to study unmet need for all women of reproductive ages in the United States, as previous work has focused exclusively on older women  (Upson et al. 2010) .   Third,   by combining  data from several recent surveys,  this study is able to analyze  a larger sample  of women  than  those used  in previous research  on unmet need in the United States . This is important, because the data restrictions that must be imposed in order to study unmet need can greatly reduce the number of  women who can be included in an analysis. As a result, this make it difficult to explore heterogeneity of many characteristics simultaneously without a substantial loss of statistical power."
"13" "Background"
"14" "Studies of unmet need have predominantly focused on developing countries , as the indicator has served as a key metric informing and guiding family planning programs aiming to reduce fertility ,  improve reproductive health , and enhance reproductive autonomy   (Cleland, Harbison, and Shah 2014) .  Yet unmet need is not exclusively  an issue of   countries with high fertility  and/ or low economic development .  Recent worldwide estimates  for married/in-union women  have shown that  even in  wealthy, low-fertility countries  there can be  high levels of unmet need   (Alkema et al. 2013) .    Relatively h igh levels of unmet need were found in, for example,  Japan  ( 17.2% ),   Austria (14.4%),   Lithuania (15.2%), and Spain (13.1%).   A nother  study also found  that 15.2% of Swedish  women  had an  unmet need  for contraception   (Hellström, Gemzell Danielsson, and Kopp Kallner 2019) , and a recent study of American women regardless of marital status estimated an unmet need of 8.8%, which is near the average for developed countries  (Grady et al. 2015) .  Evidence from the international comparison showed  that the difference in the average level of unmet need between developing and developed countries was small  ( 12.8% versus 9.3%, respectively )   (Alkema et al. 2013) . Nevertheless, there is little research into the  prevalence and correlate s  of unmet need in  more developed  countries  despite the fact that unintended pregnancies account for over half of all births even in these populations  (Singh, Sedgh, and Hussain 2010) ."
"15" "Many studies have examined the factors associated with contraceptive use in the United States , in general.   They have typically found that women with lower levels of education, who were black, or were covered by public health insurance or uninsured have  comparatively  lower rates of  any  contraceptive use  (Frost, Singh, and Finer 2007, Dehlendorf et al. 2014, Mosher, Jones, and Abma 2015) .  There are not just disparities  in  contraception  use ,  however,  but also in the methods  women adopt  and how consistently they employ them .  Among contraceptive users,  Dehlendorf et al. (2014)   documented lower odds of using highly-effective versus less-effective methods among mi nority women and those with  more than a high school degree, and  Wu et al. (2008)  showed that black women use contraception less consistently than white women.  A drawback of t hese studies , however, is that they   focused on all women rather than those wishing to avoid pregnancy ,  and therefore could not identify the demand for contraception,  i.e.  the percentage of women who are fecund, sexually active, and do not want to become pregnant  (Bongaarts 2014) ."
"16" "O nly a few  studies  have focused specifically on  the individual-level correlates of  unmet need  in the United States .  One study  of  women in 2002 found higher levels of unmet need among women who were black, foreign-born, and low-educated , but was only focused on women between the aged 35-44   (Upson et al. 2010) .  A more rec ent study  focused on women of all reproductive ages  for  the period 2006-2010  and  also found increased odds of having an unmet need for contraception among  black women compared to white women as well as women below age 26 compared to women aged 36-44  (Grady et al. 2015) .  These are the only studies to my knowledge that have specifically analyzed unmet need and its associated factors in the United States."
"17" "Although it is beyond the scope of this study to explain variation in unmet need, it is worthwhile to  discuss  why  contraceptive use may vary between groups , even when women wish to avoid pregnancy,  in terms of the supply of and demand for contraception .  Supply-side factors  refer to  the costs, availability,   and access to contraceptives and contraceptive services.  The cost  of contraception  has  proven to be  an  especially  important barrier to contraceptive use in the United States , and may differentially affect specific groups of women .  For example, a  study of women veterans found that black and Hispanic women were more likely than white women to consider low cost as an important characteristic of contraceptives  (Callegari et al. 2017) .  The Con traceptive CHOICE Project  pro vided no-cost contraception as well as information on contraceptive methods to women  in the St. Louis area who did  not want to become pregnant and were not using any form of contraception. The results of the study showed that 67% of enrolled women chose long-acting reversible  contraceptive (LARC)  methods once financial and information barriers were removed and that there were no racial differences in this regard  (Secura et al. 2010) .  Another study from  the same  project showed that  the removal of these barriers was associated with reductions in the teenage birth rate, repeat abortion rate, and overall abortion rates  (Peipert et al. 2012) ."
"18" "Costs are not the only important supply-side barrier, however.   Institutional d iscrimination , whether perceived or real,  can also  impede contraceptive use and lead  to differences in unmet need for contraception.  If poor, low-educated, or minority women  disproportionately  believe  that they are discriminated against by family planning providers, they may feel that they will not have access to the same quality or range of services  as other women .    In a survey of 500 black women,  more than two-thirds of those who had seen a health care provider for family planning services reported experiencing racial discrimination either in the  form of poorer service or racial stereotypes, and these perceptions were stronger among lower income women   (Thorburn and Bogart 2005a) .  Another study of women’s experiences  during  antenatal  care, labor, and delivery showed that women who were below age 20, unmarried, poor, and uninsured were more likely to report experiencing discrimination  (De Marco, Thorburn, and Zhao 2008) .  Feelings of discrimination can be bolstered by the fact that minority women are disproportionately exposed to lower quality maternal care, in general.   For example, a  recent study of women in New York City showed that hospitals which have greater proportions of black babies born also have higher rates of severe maternal morbidities  (Howell et al. 2016) .   S ocioeconomic and racial discrimination  at both the individual and institutional level  may  therefore  cause some women to be more likely to avoid adopting contraceptives that require greater interaction with the health care sector."
"19" "Differentials in unmet need can also arise out of differences in the demand for contraception.  D emand-side factors include  feelings towards   various   forms  of contraception,  perceptions of pregnancy risks, household preferences ,  and  community cultural norms  (Ensor and Cooper 2004) .  The  percept ion of contraceptives in terms of their health effects   has been shown to  vary according to socioeconomic  and demographic  characteristics.   A study of unmarried women below age 30 showed that black women and those with less than a high school diploma were more likely to believe that hormonal contraceptives reduce sexual desire. Furthermore, black women were more likely to believe that hormonal contraceptives can lead to serious health problems, like cancer  (Guzzo and Hayford 2012) .  There is also evidence of racial and ethnic differences in the importance of contraceptive attributes.  Black women have been shown to  have a greater interest than white women in  contraceptive methods that are easy  to use, do not contain hormones, are acceptable to their partners, do not interrupt sex, and that can  prevent sexually transmitted infections and  to  assign a lower priority to  method effectiveness  (Callegari et al. 2017) .  Many of these preferences were also present among Hispanic women.  These findings are consistent with the  findings  that bl ack  women   have been found to be less likely to use LARC than white women  and to have higher rates of discontinuation of hormonal methods   (Shih et al. 2011, Littlejohn 2012) ."
"20" "Another important factor which can differentially influence the demand for contraception is the perception of pregnancy risk s .  A study using data from 2006-2010 found that among  women   who  had unplanned pregnancies due to not  us ing  contraception, less educated women were more likely to report that they had not used contraception because they did not think they could become pregnant  (Mosher, Jones, and Abma 2015) .  Even among women who use contraception, differential experiences of contraceptive failure may lead some women to underestimate the protection that contraception can offer.  For example, b lack and poor women have been shown to have higher rates of contraceptive failure in their first two years of use than white and higher income women   (Ranjit et al. 2001) .  The authors showed that even for highly effective methods, like oral contraceptives, black and Hispanic women, as well as women living below the poverty line, have higher rates of failure.   Groups  that   are  more likely to  experience contraceptive  failure when using  highly effective methods may therefore  be prone to have preference s  for  less-effective methods, such as condoms or withdrawal, which are more difficult to practice consistently and require the participation of a male partner ,  or to have fatalistic attitudes towards pregnancy   (Jones, Frohwirth, and Blades 2016) ."
"21" "Socioeconomic and cultural variation in  reproductive autonomy  may also  influence the demand for contraception .  A recent systematic review found that reproductive and pregnancy coercion were more prevalent among low-income, unmarried, black, and Hispanic women in the  United States  (Grace and Anderson 2018) .   For example, one study found that  black women  had  twice the probability of  white women  of having  a child if her male partner desired one but she did not  (Williams 1994) .  Another study found that black women were twice as likely   as white women  to have a partner involved with their receipt of contraceptive   services  and that greater levels of involvement were associated with greater interference with birth control   (Kavanaugh, Lindberg, and Frost 2012) .   There is also qualitative evidence  that black women  a re more likely than white women to experience reproductive coercion in the form of contraceptive sabotage and verbal pressure to promote pregnancy or specific pregnancy outcomes   (Nikolajski et al. 2015) .  Evidence from nationally representative data showed that women  who had  unintended births and had less than a high school degree, were under age 20, and  lived  below the poverty line were  less  likely to have used   contraception because of the ir male partners’ opposition  (Mosher, Jones, and Abma 2015) ."
"22" "Finally,  a woman’s  demand for contraception can be  also be shaped  by  group  norm s .  One influential source of cultural/communal pressure can come from religion. Generally, greater religiosity has been found to be correlated with lower levels of temporary, highly-effective contraceptive use, and higher levels of permanent sterilization  (Jones, Mosher, and Daniels 2012) . Because permanent sterilization is not a realistic solution for achieving the reproductive goals of many younger women, religious influences may bolster the level of unmet need among groups that have a stronger attachment to  religion .  A study of  women in Texas , for instance,  found that Hispanic women were more than twice as likely to state that contraception was against their religion than white women  (Sangi-Haghpeykar et al. 2006) .    The influence of culture on contraception is not restricted to religion, however.  Some research has highlighted a general apprehension towards contraception among black Americans stemming from  institutional mistrust and historical abuses , such as  the  forced sterilization  of black women  during the 1960s  (Roberts 2000) .  For example, a   study of 500 black men and women found that one-third of women believed that medical institutions experimented with birth control methods on minorities and nearly 20% believed the government’s family planning policies are meant to limit the number of black people in the country  (Thorburn and Bogart 2005b) .   In addition, s tronger  beliefs  in conspiracies  relating to the safety of contraception were found to be negatively associated with contraceptive use among men."
"23" "As the discussion above suggests, there are numerous supply-side and demand-side factors that may lead to inequalities in unmet need in the United States . While this study cannot explicitly test the importance of these individual factors, they can inform the discussion of the results presented in the remainder of this study ."
"24" "Methods"
"25" "This study uses data from the  five  most recent  waves of the  National Survey of Family Growth, a nationally representative survey of American families that collects information on individuals’ health, contraceptive behavior, fertility, relationships, and socioeconomic characteristics.  These waves cover the years 2002, 2006-2010, 2011-2013, 2013-2015, and 2015-2017.   The participants included in this study come from the women’s survey, which  covers  women aged 15-44 at the time of  the interview ."
"26" "In order for a woman to have been  considered to be at risk of  having an unmet need for contraception,   she must have met several criteria.   First, she must have been  fecund . Fecundity was determined through respondents’ answers to the question, “As far as you know, is it physically possible for you, yourself, to have a(nother) baby?”. Women who were non-surgically  sterile were omitted from the population at risk, but those who were surgically sterilized were included.   Second, she must have been  sexually active . A woman was considered sexually active if she reported having sex within one month of the interview date.  Th ird , she was neither  pregnant  at the interview date n or postpartum  at the time of the last sex. A woman was considered to be postpartum if she had given birth less than two months before the date of her most recent sexual intercourse in the month preceding the interview.  Pregnant and  postpartum amenorrheic  women  are typically included in aggregate estimates of unmet nee d ,  as their most recent pregnancy may have not have been wanted and they will soon reenter the risk set for un wanted pregnancy  once fecundity has been reestablished  (Nortman 1982) . They have been excluded from this analysis, however, because their contraceptive needs can only be identified with respect to their most recent pregnancy. This means that the unmet need for pregnant/amenorrheic women will refer to a different point in time than for the non-pregnant/non-amenorrheic population, which carries the implicit assumption of constant effects of covariates on unmet need over time  (Bradley and Casterline 2014) .  Finally,  a woman  must have   stated that she wanted to have no (more) children. Women’s fertility desires were obtained through their answers to the question, “Looking to the future,  do you want to have a(nother) baby at some time?”. For women who were uncertain of their desires, an additional question probed if they would probably want or probably not want a(nother) child in the future. In this study, women are considered to have wanted no more children if they either stated so directly in response to the first question or if they had stated that they probably would not want another in response to the second question."
"27" "A woman was considered to have an unmet need for contraception if she met all of the above criteria and had not used any form contraception during her most recent sexual intercourse  in the month preceding the survey. She was considered to have an unmet need for  modern  contraception if she had either used no form of contraception or if she had exclusively relied on traditional methods,  which include  withdrawal,  rhythm or ‘ safe period ’  methods .   Women who were surgically sterile were considered to be using a modern contraceptive.  In addition, women who were not using any method, but stated that they were trying to become pregnant, were not considered to have an unmet need.   It should be noted that this operationalization only identifies if a woman had an unmet need for limiting births, but not an unmet need for spacing births."
"28" "Two logistic regression models were used to estimate the association between  demographic, socioeconomic, and reproductive characteristics and the probability of having an unmet need for contraception . The first model predicts a woman’s probability of having an unmet need for  any  of contraception , and t he second predicts her probability of having an unmet need for  modern  contraception. In the former model, the dependent variable indicates if a woman who was fecund, sexually active, not pregnant or postpartum, and did not want any more children  did not use  a ny  form of contraception during her last sex ual intercourse . In the latter, the dependent variable indicates if  the same women   did  not us e  any modern contracepti on  during her last sex ual intercourse ."
"29" "The models included  three sets of  covariates for demographic, socioeconomic, and reproductive characteristics. The demographic  characteristics  included the age of the woman at the time of the survey, race/ethnicity, nativity, religion, and marital status.  The socioeconomic  characteristics  included a woman’s highest  education , total family income  as a percentage of the federal poverty line , current employment status , and form of health insurance coverage . Reproductive characteristics included her current parity,  if she had used contraception at her first  ever  sexual intercourse, if she had ever had an unwanted pregnancy , and her sexual frequency in  the month preceding the survey . In addition, the models also controlled for the wave of the NSFG in which the woman was recorded to account for differences in reporting or collection procedures, as well as time trends."
"30" "Table 1 compares the distributions of covariates for all women  and those  considered at risk of having an unmet need for contraception (i.e. the analysis sample).  The most significant difference between the two groups was that women at risk of having an unmet need were older than the general population.    About 47% of the total population was below age 30, compared to 21% for the population at risk.  This difference can be explained by the fact that this study is focused specifically on women who want no more children, which effectively excludes a large number of younger women.   Because the age distribution skews towards older ages, the  at-risk  population was also more likely to be married (61% versus 38%), to have had children (12% with no children versus 38%),  to have previously had an unwanted pregnancy (6 3 % versus 51%) , and to have a higher frequency of sex . There were virtually no differences between the general population and the women at risk with regards to their race/ethnicity, nativity, religion, education, employment status, health insurance coverage, or contraceptive use at first sex."
"31" "TABLE 1 HERE"
"32" "Results"
"33" "Table  2   shows the numbers of women who were fecund, not pregnant or postpartum, sexually active within the month preceding the survey, and who wanted no (more) children. The final two columns present the percentage of women with an unmet need for contraception and the percentage with an unmet need for modern contraception, respectively.  For the total population  of women aged 15-44,  6.8 % were classified as having an unmet need for  any  contraception between 2002 and 2017 , and   t his figure is  similar to  recent estimates  (Alkema et al. 2013) ."
"34" "TABLE 2 HERE"
"35" "The level of unmet need was found to vary according to some individual-level characteristics.  With respect to demographic characteristics, h igher levels of unmet need for any form of contraception were identified for women  who were  in their  early  twenties  (9.3%) , non- Hispanic black (10.6%) , and cohabiting  (8.9%) . Lower socioeconomic status was also correlated with higher levels of unmet need. Women who had less than a high school degree  (10.3%) ,  living below the poverty line (9.6%) , were unemployed   (8.2%) , and were  either  underinsured/ uninsured  (8.4%) , on Medicare (8.2%), or Medicaid (9.8%) less  often used contraception despite not wanting to become pregnant. Concerning reproductive characteristics, higher levels of unmet need were found among women  with no children (9.6%), those  who did not use contraception at their first sex  (9.6%), and those having sex between one and four times in the last month (8.6%) . We can also see that the overall level of unmet need declined from  8.7% in  2002  to 4.4% in  2013. After 2013, the level of unmet need has been increasing  and in the latest wave of the survey pertaining to the period 2015-2017 it was 7.4% ."
"36" "The patterns of unmet need for modern contraception  were largely similar to those described above.  Overall, 12.1% of women had an unmet need for modern methods.  Across ages, the highest levels of unmet need were for women aged 20-24 (17%) .    Hispanic  (13.1%)  and non-Hispanic black  (14.7%)  women had higher levels than non-Hispanic white women  (10.9%) .  With respect to marital status, higher levels of unmet need for modern methods were found among cohabiting (16.4%) and never married women (14.3%)  compared to married women (10.9%) .   Women having less than a high school degree  (15%) , a household income  below the  poverty line (15.1%) , who were unemployed  (13.7%) , and who  were either underinsured/uninsured  (14.9%)  or   relying on   Medicaid (15.3%)  were also less likely to be using modern contraception.  Concerning  reproductive  factors, disproportionately high levels of unmet need for modern methods were found among nulliparous women   (17.8%) , women who had not used contraception at their first sex  (15.1%), and women reporting having sex between one and four times (14%) .   Across time, the level of unmet need for modern methods was fairly stable , ranging from 11. 2 % to 13. 4 %."
"37" "The results from the logistic regressions may be found in Table  3 . With respect to age,  women aged  15-19 had about 70% lower odds of  having an unmet need for any contraception than women aged 25-29. This was the only group with a significantly different level of unmet need  compared to the reference group . The most  noteworthy  result  from  this model was that non-Hispanic black women had more than twice the odds of having an unmet need than non-Hispanic white women.  This finding is consistent with previous studies of unmet need in the United States  for earlier years   (Grady et al. 2015) .   Hispanic women’s odds were not significantly different than those of white women.  Catholics and  women of  other religions had 5 6% and  6 9 % higher odds , respectively,  of having an unmet need than women with no religion. Never married and divorced women had about 40% lower odds of unmet need than married women."
"38" "TABLE 3 HERE"
"39" "Two of the  measures of socioeconomic status were significantly associated with having an unmet need for contraception.  Women who had a total family income exceeding 250% of the federal poverty line had about 30% lower odds of having an unmet need compared to those below the federal poverty line , and those   insured by  Medicaid had  55 % higher odds of having an unmet need than women with private insurance.   Given the potentially important supply-side  barrier of the cost of contraception described earlier, this finding is significant, as many states’ Medicaid programs do not cover over-the-counter contraceptives , including Plan B, condoms, spermicides, and sponges  (Walls et al. 2016) ."
"40" "Reproductive characteristics were some of the most consistent predictors of having an unmet need for any contraception. Women who had no children were by far the most likely to have an unmet need, followed by women with one child, whose odds were about 40% lower. Women with two or more children consistently had the lowest odds of having an unmet need, about 60-70% lower than those with no children.  C ontracepti ve use  at  a woman’s  first sexual intercourse was  also  strongly associated with the odds of having an unmet need. Women who had not used any contraception at their first intercourse had 75% higher odds of having an unmet need for contraception  than those who had , suggesting that ther e  may be strong persistence in contraceptive behaviors over the life course.  Finally, the frequency of sexual intercourse in the month preceding the survey was strongly negatively associated with an unmet need for contraception. Women who reported having sex more than four times in a month had about 35% lower odds of having an unmet need than women who reported between one and four sexual encounters."
"41" "Turning  to the factors associated with an unmet need for   modern methods ,   a ge was not generally associated with unmet need, other than for the age group 30-34, who had  24% lower odds of having an  unmet need for modern contraception  compared to women aged 25-29 . Racial differences remained large, as black women had 4 0 % higher odds of having an unmet need for modern methods compared to white women. This estimate is likely lower than in the previous model because white women tend to rely  more  on traditional methods, like withdrawal  (Frost and Darroch 2008) . Catholics were also more likely to have an unmet need for modern  contraception , having 36% higher odds than unaffiliated women .   This was a surprising finding, as recent studies have found no differences in unmet need based on religious affiliation  (Upson et al. 2010, Grady et al. 2015) ."
"42" "There was no association between any of the socioeconomic factors and the odds of having an unmet need for modern methods.  It should be noted, however, that the estimates for women insured by Medicaid and  those who  were  underinsured/uninsured   were  on the border of the 5% significance threshold, and suggest 28% and 24% higher odds of having an unmet need for modern methods, respectively."
"43" "Reproductive characteristics continued to be strong predictors of unmet need  in this model .  Parity was again negatively associated with unmet need, with nulliparous women having the  highest  odds, followed by uniparous women.   The magnitude s  of the associations were similar to those in the previous model.  Women who did not use contraception at their first sex also were 5 1 % more likely to have an unmet need for modern methods  compared to women who had used contraception .  Sexual frequency  continued to be  a strong predictor ,   as well . Women having sex more than four times  in the month preceding the survey  had about 25% lower odds of having an unmet need for modern methods than women reporting having sex between one and four times ."
"44" "Discussion"
"45" "The results presented here have shown that although the level of unmet need  for contraception   among the total  population is  fairly low  by international standards  (7%) , there is considerable variation in unmet need in the United States.  Th e most striking disparity was  that non-Hispanic black women have a substantially higher level of unmet need for  both   any  contraception and  highly-effective,  modern contraception. This finding is in agreement with previous research on the subject  (Grady et al. 2015) .   What remains unclear is why this is the case. Some supply-side factors, such as the costs contraception, should have been captured by the various measures of socioeconomic status included in the model.  It was not possible, however, to control for institutional barriers that may disproportionately influence black women, such as perceived  or real  discrimination when interacting with family planning services.  If these women are more likely to feel that they will not receive the same quality of service or range of options, they may be less likely to use modern contraceptives and more likely to rely on methods that are less effective and more  difficult to use consistently."
"46" "There may also be important demand-side factors that differentially influence black women’s contraceptive use , particularly of modern methods .  Due to  a combination of  a disproportionate perception of  negative health effects,  relatively  high failure rates, and  a suspicion of family planning, in general , black women in the United States may have a greater mistrust of highly-effective hormonal methods .  Taken together, these factors may therefore push black women away from using modern methods and towards either choosing less-effective, less-consistent methods or none at all.   This is compounded by the fact that  black women may  also  have less reproductive autonomy  within relationships  than other groups   (Nikolajski et al. 2015) , which may disproportionately interfere with their ability to effectively use traditional methods as well , as these typically demand greater cooperation from partners ."
"47" "The results of the analysis also revealed previously  unidentified  differences in unmet need.  Catholics, Medicaid  recipients , nulliparous women,  and  women who had not used contraception at their first sex   were also less likely to use contraception, despite not wanting any (more) children .   Although most recent scholarship has not found a relationship between religio us  affiliation  and contraceptive use  (Jones and Dreweke 2011, Kramer, Rowland Hogue, and Gaydos 2007) , this study found that Catholics were substantially more likely to have an unmet need for any contraception and for modern contraception  after controlling for other covariates .   This was a surprising finding, because, d espite doctrinal opposition towards most forms of contraception, there is  little  evidence that American Catholics actually follow these prescripts.  Generally, Catholic women have been found to have fairly similar contraceptive patterns as women of other religions or without a religious affiliation  (Jones, Mosher, and Daniels 2012) .  This finding is therefore difficult to explain and needs be explored further in future work."
"48" "The disproportionately high level of unmet need among women  relying on Medicaid  and  those who are underinsured or  without insurance  deserves special attention .  Although health insurance is not required to obtain some forms of contraception, u nderinsured and uninsured women  will have less access to highly-effective modern forms of contraception. A study of contraceptive patterns in the United States in 2010 showed that women without insurance were about half as likely to use the pill, for instance, as women with private insurance , and women with either no insurance or on public insurance were about twice as likely to rely on female sterilization  (Jones, Mosher, and Daniels 2012) .   Although the results showed no statistical difference in modern contraceptive use between the  types of  insurance  coverage , the estimates for Medicaid recipients and women without  insurance  were near the threshold for statistical significance, and suggest there may be important barriers preventing these women from using highly-effective methods.  Because  women  without insurance or those covered by public insurance may be disproportionately negatively affected by an additional birth, it is plausible that they may be  more likely to prefer  highly-effective  methods . This preference may be reinforced by the fact that , compared to women with incomes 250% or more above the poverty line,  poorer  women have been shown to have about double the rate of contraceptive failure for all methods other than LARC methods   (Ranjit et al. 2001) , which    may  cause them  to  view other methods as unreliable.  If  poor women  are  less  able to  gain access to   such methods,  they may be  more prone to use no contraceptive methods at all."
"49" "A surprising finding was that nulliparous women were the most likely to have an unmet need for contraception, as one would expect that this group would be comprised of women who are  more determined  contraceptors.  One potential explanation for this pattern is that nulliparous women may also have  a higher variability of sexual intercourse. That is, although the models control for the frequency of intercourse, they do not control for the regularity of intercourse. If nulliparous women are less likely to have  sex  on a regular basis ,  they may  also  be  less likely to consistently use any form of contraception, despite not wanting any children.  In the sample analyzed in this study, nulliparous women had the lowest frequency of sexual intercourse and were far more likely to be single , both of which are suggestive of less predictable contraceptive needs .    The r egularity  of intercourse  may therefore be an important omitted variable mediating this association."
"50" "Finally, the results showed that contraceptive nonuse at first sex was strongly associated with having an unmet need for contraception later in life , suggesting that contraceptive  behavior  may correlate across the life course.  If this is indeed the case, the result should provide even further support for promoting effective sex education in schools  and the wider dissemination of contraceptive information among teenage women , as adopting effective contraceptive habits early may help to avert unwanted pregnancies later in life .   This finding could provide fertile ground for future research."
"51" "Conclusion"
"52" "This study has used survey data from the past five waves of the NSFG to study the factors associated with having an unmet need for contraception. It has contributed to the literature by being one of the few studies focusing specifically on unmet need in the United States, rather than only on contraceptive use more generally, and by combining multiple waves of the NSFG, including the latest available wave from 2015-2017. Making use of multiple waves of the survey allowed this study to have a larger sample size than previous studies. This is important, as the restrictions required to study unmet need can greatly reduce the number of women who can be studied and, as a result, make it difficult to explore heterogeneity of many characteristics simultaneously without losing substantial statistical power.  In doing so, the results showed that some groups, like non-Hispanic black women, Catholics, those without private health insurance, nulliparous women, and women who did not use contraception at their first sexual intercourse consistently had higher odds of having an unmet need for any contraception and an unmet need for modern contraception."
"53" "The strengths of this study notwithstanding, several limitations must be addressed. First, the data are derived from self-reported contraceptive behavior, and if misreporting of contraceptive use is correlated with any of  the  variables that were found to be associated with unmet need, the results may be biased upward. For example, if Catholic women who were using contraception were more likely to report that they were not due to its  incompatibility  with official doctrine, this may cause an association to appear where there is none."
"54" "Second,  the definition of unmet need used in this study was only relevant to women who wished to have no more children, but excluded women who may have an unmet need for spacing their births , as there was no information available in the data on whether or not women would  like to delay future childbearing . Evidence from developing countries has shown that the level of unmet need for spacing is typically much greater than for limiting births   (Bradley et al. 2012) .  As a result, the estimates presented here are most likely very conservative. There is also no guarantee that the same factors associated with unmet need for limiting would be associated with an unmet need for spacing  in the same ways ."
"55" "Third, the definition of unmet need used here was also ambivalent to women’s preferences for specific kinds of contraception   (see Rominski and Stephenson 2019) . This is especially relevant for the results concerning modern methods, as many women may have an opportunity  to use many or all modern methods, but choose not to because of method dissatisfaction . It is therefore plausible that a woman  who does not use hormonal methods or condoms, for instance, and instead relies on traditional methods may not have an unmet need for modern contraception, because she prefers using less disruptive methods.  Likewise, a woman who uses condoms as a primary source of contraception may actually prefer to use an IUD, but would not be considered as having an unmet need, even if her risk of method discontinuation is significantly higher when relying on condoms."
"56" "Despite these limitations, this study’s findings highlight several pathways for future research. First, there is a need for more research on the factors associated with unmet need in other developed, low fertility countries. Other studies have shown far higher levels of unmet need in parts of Europe and Asia than those found in the United States ,  but  we know little about differentials in unmet need and how they may contribute to inequalities in unwanted  pregnancies  in these contexts .    Second, in order to address the substantial racial/ethnic inequalities in unmet need in the United States, much more work is needed to understand why black women , in particular,  are less likely to use any contraception, despite not wanting any more children.  Although several potential explanations were outlined above,  more qualitative work comparing women of different races with an unmet need is needed to understand  the relative importance of supply-side and demand-side factors in the decision to not use contraception.  Having a better understanding of these  factors  can help policymakers and researchers determine  if there are effective measures that can be taken to reduce racial disparities in  contraceptive use  and pregnancy  among women who do not want to become pregnant .  Finally , future work both on the United States and other wealthy populations  ought  to extend the definition of unmet need to incorporate birth spacing. Unmet need for spacing accounts for a much larger share of the total unmet need than does limiting, yet there is virtually no research into this aspect of unmet need in high-income populations ."
"57" "Unmet need is  often thought of  as a problem of developing countries struggling to reduce fertility rates, but this  and other recent studies have shown that relatively high levels of unmet need can be found  among sub-populations of  developed countries as well .  More research is needed to help us understand the barriers that prevent women from using contraception,  even when it is widely available , and what the long-term implications of unmet need are in  these  societies."
