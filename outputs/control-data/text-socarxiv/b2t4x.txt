"11" "ABSTRACT"
"12" "A  growing body of the  literature has argued that austerity  h as  been  bad for health, though without directly measuring austerity.  This  paper  explicitly distinguishes the  association of mortality with  macroeconomic fluctuations from  th at   with   fiscal policy  measures, using  data  for  2 8  European  Union  (EU)  countries  covering  the period 1991-201 3 .  The  main results  present a nuanced, complex picture about the mortality impact of fiscal  policies .  We  confirm the mortality decreasing (increasing) effect of recessions (booms), with  the exception of suicide mortality, which shows the opposite effects.  A usterity regimes are   associated with an increase in all-cause mortality (0. 7 % ) .  At the same time,  fiscal stimuli  tend to  significantly  increase death rates due to cirrhosis or chronic liver disease  (3 % ) and  those  due to  vehicle accidents ( 4.3 % ) .  Overall ,  the  results  appear to be sensitive  to the set of countries included :  when   exclud ing   t he Baltics, Romania and Hungary,  austerity  policies turn out to significantly increase suicide-related mortality  (2.8%) ,  while the effect on  all-cause mortality   remains the same  (0.7%) ."

"20" "INTRODUCTION"
"21" "A  growing  body  of  research  has  examined the  effects of the  Great Recession on health, using either single country time series analysis  ( De Vogli, Marmot et al. 2012 ,  Antonakakis and Collins 2014 ,  Regidor, Barrio et al. 2014 ,  Crost and Friedson 2017 ,  Kaplan, Collins et al. 2017 ,  Toffolutti, McKee et al. 2018 )  or cross-country panel regressions  (Stuckler, Basu et al. 2009; Chang, Stuckler et al. 2013, Taylor-Robinson and Barr 2017 , Pérez-Moreno, Blanco-Arana et al. 2016 ,  Bilal, Cooper et al. 2017 ,  Crost and Friedson 2017 )   .  The large majority  finds that mortality rates, with the exception of suicides, tend to be pro-cyclical, i.e. when unemployment rates increase mortality tends to decline   ( Ruhm 2000 ,  Gerdtham and Ruhm 2006 ) .  More recently, the association between the two seems to have weaken and  for some age-groups and causes of mortality the association might  have reversed  ( Lam and Piérard 2017 ) .  As far as Europe is concerned, Tapia-Granados and  Ionides   investigated  the  relationship  by using data for 27 European countries , finding   robust evidence of pro-cyclicality  ( Tapia Granados and Ionides 2017 ) . However, little is known about the potential modification  effect  through policy."
"22" "In a widely regarded book ,  Stuckler and  Basu   ( 2013 )   have  suggested  that some of the adverse health effects that appear to have resulted from the recession  would be  directly attributable to  austerity.  This widespread concern echoed outside academia , leading,  for  example,  the former International Monetary Fund leader  (Dominik Strauss-Khan)  to  ask “What about the human costs? This is the real tragedy”  ( Guardian 2010 ) .   The evidence  accumulated to date  appears to be conflicting ,  with some papers claiming that the public health tragedy in Greece seem s   “overly  exaggerated ”   ( Granados 2013 ,  Granados and Rodriguez 2015 ) ,   and arguing that the country was no exception to the main finding of the literature which sees countries improving population health in recessions (the “healthy recession paradox”)    ( Granados 2013 ) ."
"23" "T o the best of our knowledge,  the vast majority of existing studies   that claim to assess  the health -response to  austerity  ha ve   refrained from  explicitly incorporat ing   fiscal  polic y measures , with the  notable  exception of  Bilal et al   ( Bilal, Cooper et al. 2017 ) .    The authors  analyze the impact of macroeconomic  fluctuations  on mortality ,  using data from 21 OECD countries covering the period 1980-2010.  Their results confirm the pro-cyclicality of overall mortality. The association between economic fluctuations and mortality appears, however,  to  be moderated by social protection expenditures, in the sense that the link  between macroeconomic fluctuations and mortality is weakened in countries which have increased social protection expenditure s . Yet , social protection expenditures are just one dimension of the overall fiscal policy stance, failing to capture other dimensions, including tax rebates or governmental loans to firms.  This paper attempts to fill this gap,  by analysing ,   in particular ,   the association between  very tight  fiscal  policies (i.e. austerity) /very loose (i.e. financial stimul i )   and health  –  proxied  by a wide range of mortality outcomes  –  for  28   EU  countries  over  the period  1991-2013 ."
"24" "One simple measure of fiscal policy  is  the primary fiscal balance: i.e. the difference between total general government expenditure and revenues net of interest payments on consolidated general government liabilities  ( expressed  as a share  in GDP ) .  Changes in the primary balance can arise passively, as revenues and expenditures rise and fall with economic activity, or actively, as governments make choices about tax, transfer and spending policies. However,  the relative simplicity of the primary fiscal balance is more than outweighed by its limitations:  F irst,  “ it  ignores cyclically induced fluctuation s in  the primary deficit”   (p. 213 in  Alesina  and  Perotti , 1996).  S econd,   it  fails to  capture the discretionary change in fiscal policy , which ideally is what would be needed  when trying to assess the impact of fiscal policy on outcomes of interest . Hence, the primary fiscal balance  w ould not  serve  as a  particularly  useful proxy of fiscal policy  in the present case .  Nonetheless ,  we employ this simple measure  for illustration purposes  as part of our robustness checks."
"25" "The macro-economic literature proposes three other main measures to  capture  the  stance of  fiscal  policy  (see  ( Alesina and Perotti 1995 )  for an overview )   i ) the OECD measure ,  ii) the IMF measure , and  iii) the  Alesina-Ardagna  Fiscal Index (AAFI)  (also called  ‘ Blanchard Fiscal Index ’ )   ( Blanchard 1993 ) .  The OECD measure operationali ses the fiscal impulse as “the difference between the current primary deficit and the primary deficit   that would have prevailed  if expenditure in the   previous year had grown with potential GDP, and revenues had   grown with actual GDP ” (p.  213  in  Alesina  and  Perotti ,  1996) .   Th i s measure has  the disadvantage  of  rely ing  on “potentially questionable measures of potential outputs” (p. 9 in  Alesina  and  Perotti , 1996).  T h e OECD  measure tends to overestimate   (underestimate)  systematically  the discretionary component when the deficit falls (increases)   ( Perotti 2005 ) . The IMF measure differs from the OECD measure only in replacing the previous year with a  different, arbitrarily selected year.  The third  measure  (i.e. the AAFI)  has   the attractive feature to maintain simplicity and transparency,  while also  provid ing  a cyclical correction for the unemploymen t rate  ( Alesina  and  Perotti , 1996).    More specifically ,  it  entails  calculating what  the government budget would be ,   had the  unemployment  rate  not changed  since  the previous year  ( Alesina  and  Perotti , 1996).    According to  Alesina  and  Perotti , “ this cyclical adjustment is an attempt at eliminating from the budget changes in taxes and transfer associated with changes in the unemployment rate” (p. 10 in   Alesina  and  Perotti , 1996) ."
"26" "For the purpose of our analysis  we opted for the  AA FI   (whose methodology is  further  explained below) ,  based on  its simplicity, its  ability to  adjust for  cyclical fluctuations  as well as its ability to capture discretionary fiscal policy changes .   This is the relevant measure for us, as  we are interested in understanding how large discretionary   fiscal policy  changes might affect population  health, rather than focusing on the effect of cyclical fluctuations  themselves .   The  AA FI   has been  widely  used  in the macroeconomic literature  ( Alesina and Perotti 1995 ,  Barro and Redlick 2011 ,  Eggertsson and Krugman 2012 ) ,  but,  as far  as we are aware , has  hitherto not  entered  the health  or health economic  literature."
"27" "The  AA FI   is calculated as follows:"
"28" "AA = ( g i ,t (U i,t-1 ) – τ i,t ) –( g i , t-1 - τ i , t-1 )                   (1)"
"29" "where   g it  measures the total current government expenditures as a percentage of GDP for country  i  at time t, U  captures the  unemployment rate and τ represents the total government revenues as a share of GDP."
"30" "Following  Alesina  and  Perotti   ( 1995 ) , we implement th e AAFI  by regressing for each country in the sample the current expenditure on a linear time trend   and on the unemployment rate. We then estimate what would be the expenditure level in each year t if the unemployment rate was the same as in the previous year (i.e. using the fitted values ) , which gives us  g i ,t (U i,t-1 ).   The  AA FI   is ,  then ,  constructed by subtracting the primary deficit of the previous year from the unemployment - adjusted measure of the primary deficit.  According to   Alesina  and  Perotti  (1995) ,  a  ‘ very tight ’  fiscal policy   is defined as a decline in the  AA FI   variable  by more than  1.5   percentage points and is taken as a proxy of austerity. By contrast ,  a  ‘ very   loose ’  fiscal adjustment   is defined as an increase in the fiscal impulse variable by more than 1.5   percentage points.  A  merely  ‘tight’ (‘loose’) fiscal adjustment is assigned to a change in the  AA FI  of between -1.5 to -0.5 (0.5 to 1.5).  If the fiscal  impulse  varies between -0.5 and 0.5 percentage points,  this is considered  as  ‘ neutral ’  fiscal policy ."
"31" "In order to integrate our fiscal policy measures in to  our overall regression framework we add two  dummies  ˗   capturing  a  very tight (A) and very loose   (FS)  fiscal policy   stance     ˗  as  regressors  in the standard country-time specific model proposed by  Gerdt h am  and  Ruhm   ( 2006 ) .   More specifically ,  we estimate the following model:"
"32" "(2)"
"33" "w here   M represents  either the overall or  the specific mortality rate for country  i  at year t,  X   refers to % of males  aged less  than 65  years, U represent the unemployment rate – the standard proxy for macroeco nomic conditions.     C represent s  country dummies,   represents a country - specific linear time-trend .   ε  it is assumed to be  a mean zero error term, uncorrelated with the other observables (i.e. E( )=0). We are interested in the sign  and the magnitude of both    and  .   It is important to emphasise though that the ‘effect’ we are estimating cannot literally be understood as a true causal one, since we cannot exclude the potential influence of time-varying unobservable factors."
"34" "2 . T HE DATA"
"35" "We use data from 2 8   EU  countries (see  Web  Appendix  Table A I  for the full list) covering the period 1991-201 3  from  The  European Health for All Database (HFA-DB)   and  Eurostat. HFA-DB  provides  demographic, socio-economic, business cycle and health and lifestyle indicators ,  and Eurostat  contains  data on (among others) general government expenditure and revenues as percentage of GDP used to derive  the  AA FI .  Our primary analysis is restricted to those aged below 65, as they were the group   most sensitive (health-wise)  to  macroeconomic fluctuations.  Tapia Granados and Ionides (2017 ), for instance, have shown that  as for Europe, the working-age population – in particular those aged 30-44 – was the one most responsive to macroeconomic changes (i.e. the coefficient associated  with the  unemployment rate was the largest one in terms of magnitude for this specific age-band). Moreover, the main proxy used in the literature to  capture  macro-economic fluctuation s  is the unemployment rate, which is defined on individuals aged 65 or below.  Results focusing on people aged 65 and above are available in the  Web Appendix  and the results  are  discussed in  section 4  (‘ Robustness Check s ’) ."
"36" "Figure 1 highlights the decreasing trend in overall-mortality in all the European countries  included  in our analysis. T hree former Soviet Union countries  –  Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania  ( henceforth referred to as ‘ t he Baltics ’ )  – as well as  Hungary and  Romania stand out as those experiencing the highest trajectories of mortality rates  ( all  highlighted in  the  dashed line s )  and as diverging from the otherwise mostly linear trend observed across countries .  This  very  different pattern suggests considerable caution in interpreting linear regression results that  include the Baltic s , Hungary  and Romania . For this reason we present our results with and without those  five  countries."
"37" "[Figure 1 around here]"
"38" "In keeping with the previous literature  ( Ruhm 2000 )  we use several mortality indicators (for those aged below 65) as health proxies, in particular: ( i ) the overall  standardized mortality,  as well as  the standardized mortality rates for  seven   major causes of mortality, i.e.  ii) m alignant-neoplasms, i ii ) cardiovascular diseases  (CVDs) ,  iv ) accidents,    v) suicides,  vi)  vehicle accidents, vii) cirrhosis and chronic liver diseases  (CCLs) , and  viii) parasitic and infection diseases ."
"39" "To illustrate how our quantitative fiscal measure aligns with more qualitative accounts of fiscal policy, Ireland may serve as a useful example.    Bergin, Gerald et al.  ( Bergin, Gerald et al. 2011 )  aptly describe the Irish Fiscal Crisis from the 1970s until 2011. Between the late 1990s and 2007, Ireland had the highest economic growth rate among the OECD countries (with an employment rate of more than 60 per cent and an unemployment rate of only 3 % in 2007). With the Great Recession starting from 2008, the GDP fell and both asset values (with focus on the housing market) and the banking markets collapsed, producing a fiscal deficit. From the late 2008/beginning of 2009 the government put in place severe austerity measures with focus on an increment in the taxation and a cut in public expenditures. In 2009, with the ‘Emergency’ Budget, the rates for the income levy more than doubled (from 2 to 6 %  of the gross income), the universal Early Childcare Supplement for children under 6 and the  supplement for newly-unemployed under 21 were abolished and, but surprisingly the social transfer were increased on average by 3 % . The 2010 budget announced a nominal cut in social welfare support by about 4 % ; the categories more affected were the working age population (no measures on the  pensioners were taken). More specifically, the unemployment benefits were severely reduced for people aged between 21 and 25 and child benefits were cut by 10 % . In the 2011 Budget, further cuts were implemented for the working age population. Our data confirm the implementation of fiscal stimuli policies up to 2008 and then a rapid decline. More specifically our fiscal indicator shows an increase in the fiscal stance by more than 1.5 percentage points in 1996, 1998, 1999, 2001, 2007 and 2008. In 2009 it shows a decrease in the fiscal stance by 4.08 percentage points.   Tables  AV  in the Web Appendix provide  the quanti tative results  for all countries."
"40" "3 .  R ESULTS"
"41" "Table  I  presents the regression results using as  the  main explanatory variable of interest the unemployment rate  – interpreted  as a proxy for the macro-economic cycle  –  first  without   the austerity ( A )  and  fiscal stimulus ( FS ) dummies  and then  with  them .  In line with the previous literature, our results show that mortality rates, with the exception of suicides, are pro-cyclical.  No significant effects have been found for malignant neoplasms and infectious diseases.  More precisely,  a  one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate  is associated with a  0.4% decline in overall mortality.  As for  cause- specific  mortality,  a  one percentage point unemployment rate increase  is associated  with  a decrease in  CVD s - , accident - , vehicle - accident- and  CCL -attributable   mortality by 0.5%, 1.8% ,   2.4 % and 1.2% ,  respectively. The magnitude s  of our coefficients are  broadly  in line with th ose  reported by  Ruhm  (2000) , with the exception of  CCLs  and  suicides.  Our estimated effect for  CCLs   is  almost double the one reported in  Ruhm  (2000)  – a  difference  that  might be due to the different sample we are looking at.  As regards the association between unemployment rate and suicide rates ,  our estimated coefficients are smaller than those found by  Ruhm  (2000), but in line with  those by  Tapia-Granados and  Ionides  (2017) using 2 7  European countries for the period 1995-2015 ."
"42" "The inclusion of  the  fiscal measure leads to  an   increase  in absolute  magnitude of  the association between  the  unemployment rate and both  overall  accident -  (from -1.8% to 1.7%)  and vehicle accident -attributable  mortality  (from -2.4% to -2.2%) ,  and to a decrease  in  suicid es  (from  0.9% to 0.6%)  and overall mortality  (from -0.4% to -0.5%) .   The  magnitude of the  association s  between  the  unemployment rate and  mortality attributable to  CVDs and to  CCLs   are not affected  by  the  inclusion of the  fiscal measures."
"43" "Examining the specific role  played  by fiscal measures, our results show that the implementation of austerity measure s   is associated   with  an increase by 2.7% and 0.7% in  CCLs  and   overall mortality ,  respectively. The coefficients are significant at  the  10% level only. Conversely, the implementation of fiscal stimuli  is associated   with  an increase by about 4.3% and  3% in the mortality rates due to vehicle accidents and  CCLs ."
"44" "It is  important to  not e   that drawing a direct comparison between the size of the unemployment rate and the fiscal measure coefficients is difficult as the former is continuous while the latter is binary, and  because  they tend to move at different speed. However, a  recession  ( expansion )  typically implies   an increase  ( decrease )  of several percentage points in the unemployment rate. Greece, for instance was an extreme case, as it saw the unemployment rate increase by more than 15 percentage points during the Great Recession .  Hence, the overall mortality effect of macroeconomic fluctuations  tends to  exceed the fiscal policy effect in  overall  magnitude ."
"45" "[Table I   around here]"
"46" "The picture  does  change some what  once we exclude the Baltic s , Hungary  and Romania from the analysis ,  on the grounds that they display a non-linear mortality pattern over time – a pattern that is not adequately captured by the linearity assumptions embedded in the applied regression model .  Upon  exclud ing  those countries,  as Table  II  shows,  the association between mortality rates and unemployment rate  –   decreases in magnitude  in absolute terms. More specifically ,  our results show that  a  one percentage point increas e in  the  unemployment rate  is associated  with  a decrease in overall, CVDs, accident - ,  vehicle  accident -  and  CCLs  - related mortality by ,  respectively ,  0.1%, 0.4 % ,  1.4%, 1.8% and 0.5% .  ( In the  previous  results including all countries – see  Table I  –  the  coefficients were  0.4%, 0.5%, 1.8%, 2.4%, 1.2% , respectively ) . The association between unemployment rate and  CCLs  is significant at 10% level only."
"47" "The counter-cyclical association between suicides and unemployment is confirmed also  for  the sub-sample  excluding  the Baltics, Hungary and Romania :   I n this case,  a  one percentage point increase in  the  unemployment rate leads to an increase  of  0.8% in  the  suicid e  mortality  rate ."
"48" "Again ,  also for the sample without the Baltics, Hungary and Romania, t he picture changes  somewhat  with the inclusion of the fiscal impulse measure  ( see the  right panel of Table II). A s far as  CCL -attributable  mortality  and suicides  are concern ed ,   the relationship s   turn out to be not statistically different from zero.   The association between  the   unemployment rate and vehicle - related mortality slightly decreases in absolute magnitude :  now  a  one percentage point increase in  the  unemployment rate  is associated   with  a decrease in vehicle - related  mortality  from 1.8% to  1.6%. Conversely, the  association between  the  unemployment rate and overall mortality slightly increase s  in terms of absolute magnitude , from 0.1 %  to  0.2% for each one percentage point increase in the unemployment rate."
"49" "The inclusion of  the  fiscal measure does not affect the magnitude of the association between  the  unemployment rate  on one   hand  and CVD - or  accident - related mortality  on the other hand .  Looking specifically at the  fiscal policy  effect s , we found that  austerity policies are now associated with a significant increase  both  in overall mortality  ( by 0. 7 % )   and  in suicide  mortality   ( by  2. 8 % , significant at 10% level only ) . As in Table  I , very loose fiscal policies appear  to be  positively  related with mortality rates due to  CCLs   and  due to  vehicle accident s , by 3.2  %  and 3. 1  %  (significant at 10% level only) ,  respectively ."
"50" "[Table I I  around here]"
"51" "4.  ROBUSTNESS CHECKS"
"52" "To  explore the robustness of  our results ,  we run a series of  sensitivity  checks,  results of which are  presented in  Tables I I I to V."
"53" "First, we test  in  T able I I I  whether  our results are affected by  the  ex clusion of the former Eastern European bloc , i.e.  either  those countries that were  part of Yugoslavia or of the Soviet bloc. Those countries  had    undergone a  sudden   structural  shift  from central ly  planned economy to market ec onomy   ( Taylor-Robinson and Barr 2017 ) .  It is worth noting that when excluding the (quite large) sample from our analysis ,  only accident -  and vehicle-accident -attributable  mortality  tend to be significantly associated with unemployment rate variations. More precisely ,   a  one percentage point  increase  in the unemployment rate is associated with a 3%  decrease in both  mortality rates ."
"54" "Using this new sample, we partly confirm the claim that austerity has detrimental effects on health.  A usterity measures tend to increase overall mortality, suicid e-related  mortality ,  and – if to a lesser extent – fiscal stimuli tend to increase  CCLs  mortality. In contrast to our main results, we found that austerity measures tend to be associated with a n  increase in  both  overall  accident -  and vehicle - accident -attributable mortality .   T he exclusion of such a sizeable part  of the sample  leads to an almost doubling of  the coefficient  size  associated with overall  (from 0.7% to 1.2%)  and suicide-related  (from 2.8% to 4.3%)  mortality ,  compared to  those  presented in Table I I .   O ur  austerity measure  is  now  associated   with  an increase in overall ,   vehicle accident , accidental   and suicide-related mortality by 1.2%, 3.2%  (significant at 10% level only) ,  5%  (significant at 10% level only)  and  4.3% ,  respectively. Conversely, the  implementation of fiscal stimuli  is associated  with  an increase in mortality d u e to  CCLs  by 3.2% (significant at 10% level only)."
"55" "Second, we t est  the robustness of  our results to the inclusion o f  other non-EU  countries :  we use a sample  of  all the European countries that  that are OECD members  (i.e. we  added to our EU sample  Iceland, Norway and Switzerland) . Doing so also confirms the claim that austerity has detrimental effects on some of the health indicators we use.  The results  (presented in Table  IV ) are broadly in line with the results found using our original sample, both in sign and magnitude.   Austerity periods  are associated  with   increments in  overall   mortality  and CCLs  by  about  0.6%  and   by 4% , respectively ; at the same time, fiscal stimuli are associated with an increase in mortality due to  vehicle  accidents and  CCLs , by 4% and 4.4% ,  respectively . With respect to  CCLs , Table  IV  – in line with Table I   – shows that the increase in mortality during  fiscally  expansionary periods is higher than during contractionary ones."
"56" "Third , we test whether our results are robust to the functional form by comparing the results using AAFI as continuous variable rather than using the two dummies FS and A.  Table  V  presents the results for all the 28 EU countries and  Table  VI  presents the results excluding the Baltics, Hungary and Romania."
"57" "By making use of this new , transformed  variable, we present the results in levels rather than in changes. Before proceeding with the interpretation of the results we should bear in mind the  caveat that the AAFI indicator represents a surplus; therefore an increase in the AAFI indicator value represents an increase in the given country’s revenues compared to its expenditure, which would  imply  a fiscal stimulus policy rather  than  an  austerity  one ."
"58" "T hese results now seem to be less affected by the sample selection, compared to the results based on the dummy-variable approach . However, they still indicate that fiscal policies  are detrimental  to   health . A s far as suicidal and vehicle mortality  are  concerned ,  the results  broadly align with  tho se   based on the sample  excluding the  Baltics, Romania and Hungary .   O ur results suggest that  a  one percentage point increase in the fiscal surplus  is associated   with  a decrease in suicides  by 0.3%  for the  28 EU countries  sample   and by 0.4%  for the sample  exclud ing  the Baltics, Hungary and Romania .    At the same time ,  one percentage point increase in the fiscal surplus is associated  with  an  increase in vehicle  attributable  mortality  by 0.6% when us ing  the  whole   sample and by 0.7% when exclud ing  the Baltics, Hungary and Romania . It is worth noting that the coefficient of suicides for the  whole  sample is significant at  the  10% level only."
"59" "Fo u rth, we test whether our results are robust to the specific fiscal measure we chose ,  by comparing the results using another  – more simple, but in our view inferior –  fiscal stance indicator: the  p rimary  d eficit.  In line with the definition used in  the  Introduction ,   a  ‘ very tight ’  fiscal policy   is defined as a decline in the  primary deficit  variable  by more than  1.5   percentage points and is taken as a proxy of austerity. By contrast ,  a  ‘ very   loose ’ or fiscal stimulus ad justment   is defined as an increase in the  primary deficit  variable by more than 1.5   percentage points."
"60" "Table  V II  presents the results for all the 28 EU countries and  V III   presents the results excluding the Baltics, Hungary and Romania."
"61" "Once again, o ur results  suggest  that  both  austerity  and fiscal stimul us  measures  are ass ociated with detrimental health effects. Table VII  indicates  that the implementation of fiscal austerity measures i s  associated with an increase in overall,  CCLs  and infectio us  disease - related  mortality by 0.8%, 3% (significant at 10% level only) and 7.3% and  with  a decrease in vehicle  attributable  mortality by 3% (significant at 10%). Some what  surprisingly, also the implementation of fiscal stimuli is associated with an increase  in overall mortality ,  and the magnitude of the coefficient matches the one found for  austerity measure s , even though the  statistical  significance  is lower  than that attributable to  austerity.  W hen exclud ing  the Baltics, Hungary and Romania  our results show that austerity is associated with an increase in overall mortality  and infectious disease related mortality  by 1% and 7.4% ,  respectively .  For the same reduced sample , f iscal stimuli are associated with an increase in   overall and  accident -related mortality by 0.8%  and   6.6 % , respectively"
"62" "The la t t er  set of results highlight s  that the choice of the fiscal indicator   metric  we use to define both fiscal austerity and fiscal stimuli measure s   does matter,  as the results appear to be quite sensitive to it.  However , one of the main concerns raised against the primary deficit is the hypothesis of full-employment which is quite unlikely during a recession  ( Alesina and Perotti 1995 ) . T herefore ,  as discussed earlier  in  the Introduction ,  the AAFI indicator  arguably  is a more robust indicator in that specific case. However,  we believe that the sensitivity of the results to the metric use is nonetheless  a  relevant  result  to be highlighted."

"64" "As further  robustness  check s , Tables AII and AIII in the Web Appendix present the results using  the  mortality rate s  for people older than 65.  Those  results show  that when the countries implement expansionary policies, malignant neoplasm related mortality  on people older than 65  appears to be affected and tends to increase by more than 0.6 % (significant at 10% level only)."
"65" "5 . D ISCUSSION"
"66" "In this paper ,  we  have  built on  the existing literature on the relationship between recessions (or booms) and health,  by examining the  role played by  fiscal  policy   in affecting  seven mortality indicators, using – for the first time in this literature – an explicit measure of   ‘ fiscal impulse ’   that has been widely used in the empirical macroeconomic literature.  Doing so   allowed us to submit the claim that “austerity kills” to more rigorous quantitative, empirical scrutiny than in previous research, which has been primarily based on descriptive case studies."
"67" "Our results suggest t hree  key findings:"
"68" "F irst,   they  partly  support the claim that austerity  has been bad for health . In our overall sample of 2 8  EU countries,  both  all-cause  mortality and mortality due to  CCLs   show a   significant increase in response to austerity . However ,  th ose  result s   are  significant at 10% only  and , as far as  CCLs  are  concern ed,  they appear to increase to a  similar  degree  during  periods  of  loose  fiscal policy .  At the same time,  fiscal expansion  periods seem to be associated with a significant increase in vehicle - related  mortality."
"69" "Second, results on the austerity effects  (and to a lesser extent on the unemployment effects)  are somewhat sensitive to the exclusion of the Baltic countries , Hungary and  Romania: when excluding them from the sample ,   austerity   turn s  out  to  significantly increase overall mortality   and suicide-related mortality."
"70" "Third,  even though  we cannot  directly compare the magnitude of macro-economic shocks with  the fiscal policy one, as they move at different speed, our results suggest that  the overall mortality effect of macroeconomic fluctuations tends to exceed the fiscal policy effect in overall magnitude."
"71" "Our results allow us to speculate  about  at least  t hree   po tential  underlying mechanisms, although the extent to which we can test any specific mechanisms in detail without individual level data remains limited: first, it might be that austerity measures  have  led to a deterioration in mental health which may explain the increase in suicides as well as an increase in stress  ( Suhrcke and Stuckler 2012 ) . Second, we might observe an income effect, in that during austerity periods people’s purchasing power declines, either via increased taxation or lower social protection, which might lead to a deterioration of public services, such as infectio us disease  control programs or universal health care access   ( Stuckler and Basu 2013 ,  Bonamore, Carmignani et al. 2015 ) .   Third, fiscal expansions may be associated with an increase in overwork, which in turn might lead to social-isolation that is one of the main drivers for suicides  ( Durkheim 1897 ,  Barstad 2008 ) ."
"72" "While the findings and approach add to the existing literature, there are important limitations that future work should seek to overcome.  First,  our   results describe the association between health, recession and fiscal policies, but  they cannot claim  a large degree of  causal inference , in light of  the  lack  of any  common   exogenous shock  – among the 28 countries  –  that  might have  allow ed   disentangl ing  the  inter- relationship between the variable s  health and austerity . Second,  our model refrains from  explicitly  modelling  the likely complex  inter- relationship between  macro-economic shocks  and fiscal policies  ( Parker 2011 ) .  Third , the effect of fiscal policies might lead to different consequences according to the population examined  –  for example ,  the effect might be different by gender  and age."
"73" "N otwithstanding  these limitations, our findings  indicate that if we are interested in understanding the impact of austerity on health, there are  insights to be gained from the  extensive macroeconomic literature on  ways of directly measuring  the stance of fiscal policy .  T hese measures should be taken explicitly into account  in such analysis, building on what has been presented in this paper .  Our initial findings suggest that the actual picture on the role of austerity (and fiscal expansion) in health may be more complex than previously thought."
