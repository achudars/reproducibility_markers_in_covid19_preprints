Abstract
This study reports on an experiment carried out to investigate native English speakers' perception of
selected Arabic phonemes after first exposure to a controlled naturalistic input of a weather report.
It closely follows Brown's model of L2 speech perception and L1 feature geometry (1998), which
seeks to relate theories of segmental phonology to L2 speech perception and the first exposure
treatment of Gullberg et al. (2010). Eight Arabic sounds were carefully selected for the experiment:
/b/-/d/ which are found in both English and Arabic; /x/-/ɣ/ which are not found in English but are
distinguished by features which are distinctive in English [dorsal, voice, continuant], and lastly the
contrastive pairs /ʔ/-/ʕ/ and /h/-/ħ/, where the latter phoneme in each pair is alien to the phonemic
inventory of English. These pairs are distinguished by the feature [RTR (retracted tongue root)]
which is lacking in the feature geometry of English. Participants were divided into an Arabic
control group, English+ group with prior exposure to Arabic, and an English group with no prior
exposure to Arabic. The results from an AX discrimination task confirmed Brown's hypothesis that
L2 perception of non-native contrasts is constrained by the L1 feature geometry.

Chapter One

1. Introduction
In second language acquisition (SLA) research, it is recognised that second
language (L2) adult learners encounter great difficulty when attempting to
learn L2 non-native sounds (Best & Tyler 2007). This difficulty is mostly
evident in the adult L2 learners’ production of what is known as accented
speech (Altenberg 2005; Zampini 2008). Infants and young children L2
learners, however, outperform adult L2 learners in learning L2 (native and
non-native) sounds and achieving L2 native-like performance (Kuhl 2000).
While acquiring both their first language (L1) and L2 at the same time,
children learn to perceive and produce L1/L2 sounds that resemble adults’
performance in that language. In other words, infants and young children, on
the one hand, seem to be language-general perceivers and are able to
discriminate phonetic features that are not present in their L1. On the other
hand, older children and adults display language-specific patterns (Werker &
Curtin 2005). Moreover, adult L2 learners struggle to acquire an L2 nativelike performance and usually speak with a foreign accented L2 even with very
long periods of residency in an L2 environment (Bohn & Flege 1992; Piske,
MacKay & Flege 2001).

According to the critical period hypothesis, it remains true that the domain of
L2 phonology is the least successful after puberty (Scovel 1988). Best &
Tyler (2007: 3) posit that ‘[…] the infant and the adult could never truly
perceive the same speech in the same way, nor could the L2 learner or
bilingual perceive L2 or L1 speech in exactly the same way as native
monolinguals of either language.’

Thus, adults’ L1 language-specific

experience constrains the perception of L2 speech contrasts that are

9

phonologically different from those of the listener’s native language, and this
inaccurate perception of L2 non-native sounds can cause adult L2 learners to
struggle with specific L2 sound contrasts (Best & Tyler 2007).

The role of speech perception in explaining the performance of L2 learners
has received considerable acknowledgment in SLA by many researchers as
early as Polivanov (1931) and Trubetzkoy (1969). Polivanov (1931) suggested
that L2 phonemes1 are perceived through the L1 system and that the
difficulties in the production of L2 phonemes, i.e., the accented speech, may
be due to L1 speech perception altering the accurate perception of L2
phonemes (Altenberg 2005). Furthermore, Trubetzkoy (1969) argued also that
adult L2 learners’ inaccurate production of L2 sounds is linked to inaccurate
L2 perception. He also argued that the L1 linguistic system acts as a
phonological filter through which the L2 sounds are perceived.

L2 production data are comparatively easier to collect and analyse than L2
perception data. Therefore, the foreign accented speech characteristic of adult
L2 learners has been explained from the point of view of production
difficulties by many researchers such as Lado (1957), Eckman (1977, 1981),
Major (1987, 1990, 1998, 2001), and Zampini (2008). Thus, most
observations and explanations of L2 phonology have been based on L2
production data rather than on L2 speech perception data. In addition to L2
production studies, L2 speech perception studies have also been conducted to
try to observe and explain the reasoning of L2 perceptual difficulties. L2
speech perception research has showen that L2 adult learners do have
perceptual foreign accents as well as having foreign-accented speech at the
production level (Strange 1994, 1995; Strange & Shafer 2008; Trubetzkoy

1 Phonemes are defined

as ‘the abstract phonological units underlying the surface sounds of a language’.
(Davenport & Hannahs 2010: 244). The terms phonemes and sounds will be used interchangeably in
this dissertation.

10

1969). In other words, adult L2 learners’ perception is shaped by the
perceptual system of their L1 and the difficulties they encounter in producing
L2 sounds could be linked to the difficulties in perceiving those L2 sounds
accurately (Brown 1998; Matthews & Brown 1998).

1.1. L2 Speech Perception and L1 Feature Geometry
As was previously mentioned, L2 phonology in SLA remains the least
successfully acquired aspect of language, especially after puberty (Scovel
1988). As early as the 1960s, researchers such as Lenneberg (1967: 171)
concluded that ‘foreign languages have to be learned through a conscious and
laboured effort’. Based on the findings of such L2 phonology research, it
could be asserted that L1 phonology can render learners insensitive to certain
properties of L2 input (Matthews & Brown 2004), as this would also explain
the difficulties L2 learners face in the attainment of native-like phonology.
According to Clements (1985), the phonemes of any given language consist
of distinctive features that are organised into hierarchical constituents known
as feature geometry. Consequently, L1 feature geometry constrains the
acquisition of L2 segmental representations, leading to transfer of L1
properties into L2 acquisition (Brown 1998). Furthermore, Strange (1995)
also proposed that many non-native L2 contrasts are difficult for adult L2
learners to be perceptually differentiated.
According to Segui et al. (2001:199), ‘Listeners interpret a non-native illegal
input sequence by assimilating this sequence to sound patterns that exist in
their own language.’ Moreover, the assimilation of L2 non-native segments
into already similar phonetic categories in L1 can be explained according to
the presence or absence of distinctive features of sounds in the feature
geometry of the languages in question (Best 1994, Brown 1998). In other
words, L2 learners’ production errors are due to problems in the perception

11

of L2 sounds (Altenberg 2005). McAllister (1997) suggests that problems in
L2 perception may be attributed to the level of accuracy in mapping L2
phonetic features into already existent L1 phonemic categories. Hence, there
are many scholars who consider that differences between L1 and L2 account
for the level of accuracy of the perception of L2 segments such as Flege in
his Speech Learning Model (1995) and Best in her Perceptual Assimilation
Model (1995).
Matthews and Brown’s findings (1998) also support the previous research in
L2 perception by proposing that the ‘assimilation’ of non-native segments
into a phonological category already present in the L1 can be explained by
distinctive features in feature geometry. This is to be contrasted with Best's
(1995) explanation of perceptual ability of non-assimilated contrasts in terms
of non-speech sounds, i.e., novel L2 segments. For example, English learners
perceive the clicks of the Xhosa language as distinctive because these sounds
are not categorised as speech sounds by English speakers.

Werker and Tees (1984) suggested that although adult listeners become
insensitive to distinguishing non-native sounds, they do not lose the capability
to respond to such sounds which are not phonemically distinctive in their L1.
Brown (1998) has explored this concept further by proposing that the L1
feature geometry mediates between the incoming acoustic stimuli of a speech
stream and the abstract linguistic system, thereby sorting the stimuli into
perceptual categories. Thus, L2 sounds which can be classified within the
features present in L1 would be able to pass through this geometry filter,
whereas L2 sounds or features which are alien to L1 would be deflected away
from it, which in turn would lead to inaccurate L2 sound perception.
However, Brown (1998) revealed that high-level learners could be taught to
discriminate and distinguish sounds in the L2 category where, over time, a

12

new feature geometry for the L2 sounds will be established within the
learners’ linguistic system.

So far, this paper has introduced the first part of this introductory chapter. The
following section will introduce first exposure studies as this is one of the
major components of this study. This will then be followed by the aim and
the significance of the present study.

1.2. First Exposure Studies
Research in second language acquisition has traditionally focused on
relatively pre/upper intermediate and/or advanced stages of L2 acquisition
(Perdue 1996). Consequently, the literature that documents the very initial
state of L2 acquisition, i.e. after adult first exposure to L2, is limited. L2
acquisition is different from that of L1 in that the learner is already equipped
with a complete L1 linguistic system (Cook et al. 1979). As a result, several
researchers have begun to examine the very initial state of L2 acquisition in
what has come to be known as ‘first exposure studies’. First exposure studies
refer to a recent development within second language acquisition research
that seeks to observe and explain the adult L2 learners’ initial state through
the use of controlled L2 input (Carroll 2014).

According to Carroll (2004), the primary goal of SLA is to describe and
explain the nature of linguistic development from L2 first exposure to
ultimate attainment. Moreover, SLA also aims to describe the developmental
trajectory and to describe the role of L1 as a central issue (Major 2001). As
was mentioned previously, most theories of adult L2 learning mechanisms
are based on pre/upper intermediate and/or advanced stages where knowledge
of an L2 has already been acquired. Perdue (1996) pointed out that this gap
in the literature of adult L2 initial exposure is due to the fact that there are

13

few empirical studies that investigate adult first exposure to L2. Likewise,
Vainikka and Young-Scholten (1998) emphasised the importance of
collecting data at the initial state of L2 first exposure in order to increase our
understanding of this significant period and to bridge this gap in SLA
literature. In other words, first exposure studies can enrich our understanding
of the adults’ initial states of L2 exposure and L2 perception and in turn might
present ideas for comparison between L1 child acquisition (Jusczyk 1997;
Jusczyk et al. 1993) and L2 adult acquisition.

1.3. Aim of the Present Study
The purpose of the present study is twofold. First, to conduct an experiment
to investigate English speakers' perception of selected Arabic sounds after
first exposure to a controlled naturalistic input as in Gullberg et al.’s study
(2010). Second, to investigate whether the feature geometry of L1 (English)
affects the perception of English adult learners of novel L2 (Arabic) sounds
(Matthews & Brown 1998). The experiment design closely follows the
methods of Brown (1998) and Matthews and Brown's model of L2 speech
perception (1998) in which the main focus is on the relationship between
theories of L1 feature geometry and speech perception of a target language.
That is, Brown's model of L2 speech perception seeks to explain why learners
of a particular L1 are adept or not adept in discriminating certain sounds of a
particular L2. This model predicts which sounds will present the least/most
problems to L2 learners. The experiment in the present study aims to
investigate whether novel sounds whose features are existent in the feature
geometry of the L1 would pass through the ‘geometry filter’, and whether
sounds that cannot be classified within the features present in the L1 feature
geometry would be altered to be inaccurately perceived (Brown 1998;
Matthews & Brown 1998). Thus, this paper seeks to confirm or otherwise
Brown's model of L2 speech perception and effects of L1 feature geometry

14

on the perception of L2 novel sounds. Moreover, L2 teachers and learners
equally appreciate identifying and explaining the factors that influence the
degree of L2 foreign accents (Piske, MacKay and Flege 2001).

1.4. Significance of the Present study
In SLA, adult learners’ L2 production has received serious attention in many
studies such as, Archibald (1998) and Leather (1999). Young-Scholten and
Archibald (2000), as previously mentioned, have pointed out that much of the
available data come from the production of intermediate level learners with
considerable L2 exposure. Limited attention has been directed to L2
perception. According to Altenberg (2005: 55) ‘little attention has been paid
to the issue of knowledge, as distinct from perception and production, in the
acquisition of second language phonetics and phonology’. Furthermore,
while there have been various investigations into the sensitivity to L1
phonotactic knowledge of infants and adult native speakers, there has been
little attention paid to second language acquisition (Sebastián-Gallés & Bosch
2002).
As mentioned earlier, the present study aims to investigate English speakers'
perception of selected Arabic sounds after first exposure to a controlled
naturalistic input in an attempt to investigate whether the feature geometry of
L1 affects the perception of adult L2 learners of novel L2 sounds (Matthews
& Brown 1998). Few studies have explored adult L2 learners’ perception at
the initial state of learning. Therefore, this study aims to fill in this gap in the
literature by conducting an experiment to investigate the perception of L2
novel sounds and the role of L1 feature geometry after first exposure. This is
done by applying Brown (1998) and Matthews & Brown (1998) model, in
which the main focus is on the relationship between theories of feature
geometry and speech perception of a target language. To the best of my

15

knowledge no study so far has attempted such an investigation in a first
exposure study.
In the next chapter, the literature on first exposure studies as well as L2
perception studies are reviewed. In chapter three, an overview of the
methodological procedure, data collection technique and an account of the
participants is detailed. Data analysis and findings are presented in chapter
four. Finally, a detailed discussion of the results followed by the conclusion
are presented in chapter five.

Chapter Two

2. Literature Review
2.1. First Exposure research in SLA
Recently in second language acquisition research, studies of first exposure to
L2 have attracted attention and constituted a promising area of research.
Specifically, such studies contribute to bridging gaps in the literature about
the crucial first minutes/hours of naturalistic L2 contact. In so doing, they
enrich our understanding of the adults’ initial stages of L2 perception,
noticing, and comprehension, and in turn present ideas for comparison
between L1 child acquisition and L2 adult acquisition (Jusczyk et al. 1993).
As mentioned earlier, many researchers such as Perdue (1996) suggested that
empirical studies investigating adult first exposure to L2 are limited. Other
researchers such as Vainikka and Young-Scholten (1998) considered that the
collection of data at the initial state of L2 exposure is important in order to
broaden our understanding of this significant state.
SLA’s ultimate purpose is to describe the process of linguistic development
from first exposure to L2 ultimate proficiency. As mentioned earlier, there is
a gap in the literature regarding the crucial first minutes of L2 exposure. Such
a gap has led many researchers to tackle this significant aspect of SLA theory
and present important studies investigating the effect of controlled artificial
and/or naturalistic input, such as Carroll, (2007, 2012, 2014), Gullberg et al.
(2010, 2012), and Rast (2008, 2010) amongst many others.

This area of SLA is a relatively new one that started to take shape around the
late 1990s (Schwartz & Sprouse 1996; Vainikka & Young-Scholten 1996).
Therefore, different researchers have coined the term describing this area of

17

research differently. For example, it was coined as ‘ab initio’ by Han and Liu
(2013), ‘minimal exposure’ by Gullberg et al. (2010, 2012), and ‘first
exposure’ by Rast (2010) and Carroll (2013, 2014). Throughout this paper, it
will be referred to as first exposure of L2.
The focus of this paper is to investigate adult L2 learners’ perceptual abilities
of non-native L2 sounds after first exposure under the feature geometry model
of Brown (1998) and Matthews & Brown (1998). It is, thus, necessary to
point out that to the best of my knowledge no study has so far attempted such
an investigation. Therefore, the literature in this paper on first exposure
studies will present a general view of the major empirical studies of first
exposure studies conducted so far, such as Carroll (2007, 2012, 2014),
Gullberg et al. (2010), Han & Liu (2013), Rast (2008, 2010) and Park & Han
(2008).

SLA researchers such as Carroll (2007, 2012, 2014), Gullberg et al. (2010),
and Rast (2008) amongst many others have conducted L2 research
investigating the effect of a controlled artificial and/or naturalistic input with
adult L2 learners to examine adult L2 learners’ input processing abilities.
Numerous studies have also investigated first exposure through implicit
learning, for example Han & Liu (2013), Gullberg et al. (2010), Carroll (2012,
2014), and Carroll & Widjaja (2013). Overall, the major studies conducted in
this area of inquiry of the initial stages of L2 acquisition are Gullberg et al.
(2010, 2012) and Carroll (2012, 2014). The findings of these researchers
make significant contributions to first exposure studies in SLA.
Gullberg et al. (2010, 2012) investigated L1 Dutch learners’ first exposure to
L2 Mandarin with a naturalistic input of a fourteen minutes Mandarin weather
report as the treatment. This treatment was then followed by the testing
procedure to investigate the effects of input frequency on word recognition as

18

well as lexical mapping and segmentation. Gullberg et al.’s findings indicated
a positive correlation between the frequency of input and results’ accuracy.
Such findings point out that adult L2 potential acquisition abilities are far
higher than might be expected at first exposure (Gullberg et al. 2010, 2012).
Nevertheless, Carroll (2014) considers Gullberg et al.’s findings to be
optimistic, although they have a number of drawbacks. One of these
drawbacks is the use of a weather report as the naturalistic input, as it employs
simple sentences and basic linguistic properties that could account for the
higher accuracy rate in the results. Interestingly, however, Han & Liu’s
findings in 2013 contradict those of Gullberg et al.’s (2010, 2012). Han & Liu
(2013) exposed English and Japanese L1 learners to L2 Mandarin through the
use of 10 video episodes with varied themes such as ordering food in a
restaurant and bargaining in a shop. Each episode lasted for three minutes.
Han & Liu concluded that these English and Japanese L1 learners of
Mandarin struggled through all of the input processing tasks, which included
free recall, comprehension, note taking, elicited imitation, and a working
memory test.

Having presented one of the major studies and one of the opposing views, we
now turn to another important study of first exposure. Carroll’s research in
2012 and 2014 was conducted by exposing native speakers of English to L2
German to test for their segmentation abilities after first exposure. The
treatment consisted of audio-visual stimuli presented as a name-learning task.
Carroll’s findings showed that learners could successfully segment L2 speech
stream with about 90% accuracy rate and also map sound tokens to referents,
even with low exposure frequency. Carroll (2012) suggested that
segmentation abilities are evident in L2 learners even after limited numbers
of incidental exposure. However, the high rate of accuracy in Carroll’s results
could be linked to the fact that the study investigated the acquisition of proper

19

names of L2 German, which are genetically similar to the learners’ L1,
English.

Other researchers have also investigated segmentation after first exposure,
such as Rast (2010) and Shoemaker & Rast (2013). They also argued that the
L2 learner’s ability to segment linguistic components from L2 speech stream
is evident and discussed the linguistic variables of input that may affect the
L2 learner’s segmentation ability, such as frequency of input and gestures.
As previously mentioned, Carroll (2014) pointed out that the L2 learner’s
ability to segment the speech stream is evident at the initial phases of L2
acquisition and that L2 learners do segment this stream based on their
linguistic knowledge of L1, as well as other newly acquired L2 linguistic
knowledge. In other words, segmenting the lexical components of the input
is due to the experience of complex parsing that L2 learners bring to the table
(Carroll 2004).

On another note, it is necessary to point out that there are two studies which
have been conducted to test for L2 learners’ linguistic knowledge of
phonotactic constraints after first exposure. These studies will be presented,
as they are the closest to the aims of this study. The first study is conducted
by Onishi et al. (2002), who tested L2 learners’ linguistic knowledge of
phonotactic constraints after a brief auditory experience in three treatments
and tests. The aim was to test whether adult English speakers could acquire
phonotactic regularities that are not present in English. The auditory
treatments involved restricting specific consonants to specific syllable
positions. Onishi et al. claim that their findings demonstrated that phonotactic
constraints are rapidly learned from brief auditory experience and that some
constraints are more easily learned than others (2002).

20

The other study is by Altenberg (2005), who created three experiments to
examine the acquisition of English word-initial consonant clusters by native
speakers of Spanish. These experiments consisted of a metalinguistic
judgment task, a perception task, and a production task. The findings of
Altenberg’s study suggests that beginning as well as advanced L2 learners
show an accurate knowledge of English phonotactics and that L1 transfer
does not play a role in the learners’ perception. However, this knowledge
cannot be compared to that of a native speaker of English either in perception
or production.

As a final point in this section, it should be noted that first exposure studies
do contribute to elucidating adult L2 learners’ linguistic abilities when faced
with an unknown language for the first time. As mentioned earlier, there are
a limited number of studies addressing this issue in SLA. Therefore, it is
important for future research to address this matter. Thus, this study is an
attempt to contribute to this area of research by presenting a study that is
designed to replicate Gullberg’s et al. (2010) treatment of a weather report to
investigate English native speakers’ perception of selected Arabic sounds
under the feature geometry model of Brown (1998) and Matthews & Brown
(1998). This study partially replicates the methods of Brown (1998) and
Matthews & Brown’s testing procedure (1998).

2.2. L2 Speech Perception
It is necessary to start this section by first presenting the view through which
recent scholars in SLA approach L2 speech perception. According to
Escudero (2005:7), ‘speech perception is the act by which listeners map
continuous and variable speech onto linguistic targets’. Escudero further
explains that ‘speech perception is learned through language experience, the
number and nature of distinctive sound categories, i.e., the sound inventory

21

of a language, which can be seen to result from the mapping mechanism that
has been developed to accurately classify the speech signal produced in a
given language environment’ (2005: 37). Diehl, Lotto & Holt (2004) also
consider that adult L2 learners categorise acoustic-phonetic stimuli as
language-specific sounds based on their language-specific perceptual system.
Additionally, Escudero (2005: 36) posits that ‘sound representation is a
consequence of language-specific perceptual mappings which have
developed through language experience’. Thus, speech perception is
considered to mediate between the auditory input and the internally stored
linguistic representations (Escudero 2005).

2.2.1. Language-Specific (L1) Perception and L2 Perception
As mentioned in the introductory chapter, infants and young children L2
learners outperform adult L2 learners in learning L2 sounds and in achieving
L2 native-like performance (Kuhl 2000). While acquiring their first language
and the L2 at the same time, every child learns to perceive and produce L1
and L2 sounds that resemble adults’ performance in that language. However,
language-specific perception starts to formulate in infants during their first
year of life (Jusczyk et al. 1993; Polka & Werker 1994). Kuhl (2000) argues
that infants develop from a universal auditory discrimination to a filtered
language-specific perception as a result of language-specific experiences. As
a matter of fact, language-specific experiences of specific sound systems of
different languages can differ significantly from one another, leading to
expected difficulties in L2 learning, especially with non-native sounds (Lado
1957). Lado (1957) posited that L2 non-native phonemes that have L1 native
counterparts would be easy to learn, whereas non-native phonemes with no
such counterparts would be difficult to learn. Thus, L2 sound perception is
considered to be highly constrained by the learner’s L1 linguistic experience,

22

i.e., by the sounds and perceptual processes of L1 (Escudero 2005). Likewise,
Strange & Shafer (2008) suggested that the phonetic segments which are
phonologically distinctive in L2, but not in the learners’ L1, are often
incorrectly recognised and categorised leading to L2 production difficulties.

Lado’s hypothesis has been confirmed by the findings of many studies, for
example, Best & Strange 1992; Halle, Best & Levitt 1999; Miyawaki et al.
1975; Sheldon & Strange 1982; Strange & Shafer 2008. These studies
investigated the difficulty that the Japanese learners encounter in perceiving
the English sounds /r/ and /l/ in comparison to the ease of perceiving the
English sounds /r/ and /w/. The results of these studies suggest that since the
/l/ sound does not have a counterpart in the Japanese L1 phonemic inventory,
it is difficult to be perceived and learned by the Japanese learners, whereas
since the English /r/ and /w/ do have a similar counterpart, they are easy to be
perceived. Likewise, native English adult speakers have the same perceptual
difficulty in differentiating the Hindi initial stops /ṱ/ and /ʈ/ (Werker et al.
1981; Polka 1991 in Strange & Shafer 2008; Polka 1992). Therefore, it is now
argued that L1 language-specific perceptual knowledge affects the adult
learners’ L2 experience. In other words, adult learners’ L2 perception is
affected by their linguistically systematic perception of their native language
(Brown 1998).

In the next section, a brief presentation of the several studies that addressed
the reciprocal relationship between the perception and production of L2
sounds is presented, followed by a literature review of the different L2 speech
perception models in SLA.

23

2.3. L2 Perception and Production
Having briefly presented L2 perception and production studies, I will now
present a number of studies that have focused on the reciprocal relationship
between the perception and production of L2 sounds. According to Borden,
Gerber & Milsark (1983), Korean learners were more accurate in perceiving
the English /r/-/l/ contrast than producing it. They proposed that perceptual
abilities are essential for accurate L2 production. Similarly, Neufeld’s (1988)
findings showed that adult L2 learners are able to perceptually detect sound
errors more than they are able to avoid producing these errors. Barry (1989)
and Grasseger (1991) also argued that the more accurate the adult L2 learners’
perception, the more accurate their production is. Furthermore, Barry (1989)
and Grasseger (1991) pointed out that perceptual tests can be a suitable
measure for observing and explaining difficulties in L2 sounds’ perception
and production. In addition to the previously mentioned studies, Flege (1993)
and Rochet (1995) concluded that L2 perception develops before L2
production and it is a prerequisite to achieving a successful L2 production.

It is also necessary to clarify that there are many studies that hold an opposite
view and have drawn different conclusions from those of the previously
mentioned studies. These studies include for example, Goto (1971) and
Sheldon & Strange (1982), who investigated the Japanese learners’
acquisition of the English /r/-/l/ contrast, which is not present in Japanese
phonemic inventory, and proposed that perceptual accuracy of the English /r//l/ contrast did not necessarily lead to accurate production. In a study of Dutch
learners of English, Flege & Eefting (1987) concluded that there were
considerable differences between the learners’ production of the stop
consonants /b/-/p/ in Dutch and in English, which suggested that the
distinction between the two contrasts was not as clear in perception as in
production. Moreover, Flege (1995) revealed that L2 learners may be able to

24

accurately produce non-native contrasts even though the same contrast was
not accurately perceived by the L2 learner.

Furthermore, Miyawaki et al. (1975) conducted a study to test the effects of
linguistic experiences on L2 perception. Their study showed that English and
Japanese listeners differed significantly in the perception of /r/-/l/ contrast as
these two phonemes contrast in English but not in Japanese. They reported
that the English learners performed with a high accuracy rate in a
discrimination task, whereas the Japanese learners performed relatively
poorly. Miyawaki et al.’s (1975) results suggest that L1 linguistic experience
affects L2 accurate perception.

Likewise, Aoyama et al. (2004) examined the role of L1 and the perception
of phonetic similarities and dissimilarities between L1 and L2 sounds in the
production of L2 English /r/ and /l/ sounds by L1 Japanese children and adult
speakers. The tests were conducted twice separated by one year. In both tests,
the children showed greater improvement than the adults in the production of
L2 English /r/ than /l/. Again as previously mentioned, the study showed that
children and adult Japanese listeners differed significantly in the production
of /r/-/l/ contrast, as children are known to develop from a universal auditory
discrimination system to a filtered language-specific perception as they grow
older (Khul 1991).

Moreover, Iverson et al. (2003) also tested and compared the perception of
English /r/ and /l/ by Japanese, German, and American adults. The results
demonstrated that German adults in contrast to Japanese adults are more
sensitive to the English /r/-/l/ contrast, because the German and the English
languages are more closely related to each other than Japanese is to English.
Inversion et al.’s (2003) findings show how L1 language-speciﬁc perception

25

can interfere with L2 perception. That is, the more different L1 and L2 are,
the more difficult it is for L2 novel sounds to be perceived correctly.

Having established that L1 speech perception affects L2 production, due to
language-specific linguistic experiences affecting the way that L2 learners
perceive L2, we now turn to present the different models of L2 speech
perception in SLA.

2.4. L2 Speech Perception Models in SLA
In SLA, it is commonly known that the most attested type of L2 sound
perception is the learning of L2 new sounds in which the learners’ L1 filters
L2 perception, resulting in a failure to hear the differences between certain
L2 sounds (Escudero 2005). According to Escudero (2005), this failure
presents a much-debated issue within both phonological and phonetic L2
perception models that aim to explain L2 sound perception. As a result,
different theoretical models exist in SLA literature regarding L2 speech
perception. Many studies have attempted to investigate and explain L2 speech
perception under each of these theoretical models, such as Best (1995),
Brown (1998, 2000), Flege (1987, 1993, 1995, 2002, 2003), and Kuhl (1991,
1993, 2000). These different models addressed L2 sound perception with
either a phonological or a phonetic approach, yet both of these approaches
assume that the initial state in L2 sound perception is shaped and influenced
by the learners’ L1 linguistic experience. Needless to say that L2 sound
perception’s initial state is of great interest to this present study as it aims to
investigate L2 sound perception’s initial state after first exposure.

L2 speech perception research has shown that it is possible to measure the
accuracy of the L2 learners’ perception of the novel sounds of a new language
as well as measure the L2 learners’ linguistic abilities at the L2 initial state

26

(Escudero 2005). Furthermore, knowing how different L1 speakers and
different L2 learners categorise the sounds of another language would provide
an insight into the target language initial state (Escudero 2005).

The following section will present some of the different models and studies
of L2 sound perception to establish the grounds, on which the present study
has been based, namely the feature geometry theory of L2 speech perception.

2.4.1. The Native Language Magnet Model
One of the chief models that is based on a phonetic framework in L2 sound
perception is proposed by Kuhl (1991, 1993, 2000). Kuhl (1991) argues that
infants develop from a universal auditory discrimination to a filtered
language-specific perception, as a result of language-specific experiences
which form prototypes in the infant’s perception. This in turn leads to a
perceptual magnet effect in speech perception. These prototypical categories
in the infant’s perception ‘functioned like a perceptual magnet for other
category members’ (Kuhl 1991: 93). However, as these infants grow to six
months of age they gradually lose this ability, making a transition from a
language-general to a language-specific state (Kuhl 1993; Werker & Curtin
2005). Accordingly, exposure to a specific language alters infants’ perception
(Kuhl 1993). The findings of Kuhl’s studies supported the Native Language
Magnet (NLM) theory, ‘which describes how innate factors and early
experience with language interact in the development of speech perception’
(Kuhl 1993: 93).

NLM proposes that adult L2 perception is constrained by L1 languagespecific linguistic experience and it acts as a filter that will make L2
acquisition of new sounds more difficult (Kuhl 2000). In other words, the

27

perception of L2 sounds is constrained by the L1 sound system, although the
NLM model suggests that L2 learners can create new mappings for new L2
sounds (Kuhl 2000). Additionally, the NLM proposes that perceptual
representations are stored in the memory, therefore, these perceptual
representations differ for speakers of different languages so that the
perception of any given L1 is entirely different from that of another language
(Iverson & Kuhl 1996).

2.4.2. Perceptual Assimilation Model
Another model that is also based on a phonetic framework is the Perceptual
Assimilation Model (PAM). PAM describes the process by which L2 learners
perceptually assimilate non-native sounds into their own L1 phonemic
inventory (Best 1995). It proposes three possible classifications. The first is
that a prototype of some native phoneme is categorised according to goodness
of fit that may range from excellent to poor. The second is that a consonant
or vowel that fall somewhere in between native sounds is considered
uncategorised (i.e., is roughly similar to two or more sounds). That is,
uncategorised non-native sounds can be further sorted as a two category
assimilation (a non-native sound may assimilate to two phonetically similar
native sounds) or a single category assimilation (two non-native sounds
assimilate equally well or poorly to a single native sound). The third is the
non-assimilable sound that bears no detectable similarity to any native sounds
(Best, McRoberts & Goodell 2001).

PAM proposes that infants hear and detect every articulatory gesture, and that
later on as they grow, they learn to detect only those that signal sound
contrasts in their L1 (Best 1984, 1995). It also proposes that the learners’
sound perception is language specific. That is, L2 learners can perceive

28

sounds that are only similar to that of their native language. Thus, Best’s PAM
seeks to account for L2 perception of non-native contrasts and the way that
these non-native sounds can be mapped onto the learners’ sound system. It
suggests that accuracy in the discrimination of non-native sounds depends on
the way that these sounds are assimilated to the L1 sounds. L2 learners’
linguistic perceptual device is tuned to L1 particular high-level features and
will therefore have difficulty in detecting the L2 features. In other words, the
L2 may have high-level features that signal contrasts that are actually lowlevel ones for the L2 learners. Consequently, the L2 sounds will be
assimilated to the ones in the L1. As for the effects of exposure to L2 input,
Best & Strange (1992) suggest that it may lead to the reorganisation of
assimilation patterns in cross-language perception. PAM and NLM models
have focused primarily on the L2 initial state of learning and non-native sound
perception, unlike other models that have focused on the advanced stages of
L2 learning, such as the Speech Learning Model (Best & Tyler 2007).

2.4.3. Speech Learning Model
The third phonetic model is Flege’s (1995) Speech Learning Model (SLM).
SLM theorises that the L2 initial state consists of L1 categories only. SLM is
primarily concerned with experienced L2 learners and the ultimate attainment
of L2 production (Flege 1995). Recently, however, SLM started to show
interest in the ultimate attainment of L2 perception (Flege 2003). Moreover,
SLM explains the process by which L2 learners acquire new and similar L2
sounds, and that new sounds can be acquired while similar sounds are very
difficult to be acquired, because the assimilation of a similar L2 sound into
an L1 category will inevitably lead to a change in the latter in order to cope
with the L2 productions (Flege 1987, 1995). That is, L2 sounds that are
similar to L1 sounds are less easily perceived in a native-like way than new

29

sounds are i.e., the perception of two L2 sounds as a single L1 sound, which
results in an L2 contrast neutralization as one sound, for example, the case of
the Japanese learners neutralization of the English /r/-/l/ contrast into the
Japanese flap counterpart.

Furthermore, SLM proposes that adult L2 learners start with L1 languagespecific linguistic expertise. This initial state may lead these learners to
inaccurately perceive the phonetic differences between L2 sound contrasts or
between L2 and L1 sounds because L1 phonology filters out L2 sound
features or properties (Flege 1995). SLM proposes that the phonetic
categories of the L1 and L2 are represented in a common phonological space,
thus both of the L1 and the L2 sounds are reciprocally influenced. Hence,
when a new L2 sound is similar to an L1 sound, it will dissimilate (Flege
2002). As a result, L1 and L2 perceptions by bilingual speakers will be
different from those of native speakers of the same two languages, and so will
their L1 and L2 (Flege, Schirru & MacKay 2003). On the other hand, when a
new L2 sound is different from the L1, it will assimilate to represent both the
L1 and L2 (Flege 1987). Flege’s (1987) findings showed that native English
learners of French could produce /y/ more accurately than /u/ because /y/ is
more distant from French /u/ than from English /u/.

Once again, the basic view of SLM is that new L2 sounds are more easily
learned than similar sounds (Flege 1995). Nevertheless, if the new L2 sounds
contain features that the L1 does not have, then Brown’s (1998, 2000) claims,
which will be presented shortly, make an opposite point of view to Flege’s
SLM. Additionally, it seems that Flege’s SLM holds an opposite view to
Best’s PAM as well. Unlike NLM, SLM assumes that adult L2 learners do
not lose the abilities used by infants and children to acquire their L1, including
the ability to form new phonetic categories (Flege & MacKay 2004). Flege
(2009) suggested that L2 learners could detect phonetic differences between

30

L1 and L2 by utilising all the abilities used to acquire the L1. Still, SLM as
well as PAM and NLM consider L2 perception to be language-specific.

Having presented three L2 perception models, all of which have a phonetic
approach, we now turn to an L2 perception model that has a phonological
approach. This model is of great importance to the present study as it forms
the basis on which the study’s hypotheses and research questions were based.

2.4.4. Brown’s Phonological Interference Model
Brown’s Phonological Interference Model (PIM) proposes that L1 feature
geometry and phonological structure filter the L2 acoustic input, eliminating
the ability to perceive cues in the L2 acoustic signal (Brown (2000). The PIM
posits that the L2 initial state is the L1 phonological structure. That is, adult
L2 learners transfer the L1 feature geometry to the L2 learning. Moreover,
the PIM proposes that L1 acquisition initially starts with a universal feature
geometry which is provided by UG. According to Rice and Avery (1993),
children have the ability to detect contrastive features in the input and as the
child grows older, he/she loses this ability. Thus, the feature geometry of a
particular language is present, only leading adult L2 learners to be constrained
by the L1 feature geometry of their native language (Brown 1998; Brown &
Matthews 1997).
Brown’s PIM model predicts that adult L2 learners’ perception of L2
phonological categories (i.e., phonemes) could be described according to two
scenarios (Brown 1998, 2000). First, adult L2 learners perceive fewer sounds
than the ones produced in the L2 because the L1 has fewer sound categories
than the ones found in the L2. The most common case of this type involves
the perception of two L2 sounds as a single L1 sound, which results in an L2

31

contrast neutralization, as in the case of Japanese learners of the English /r//l/ contrast which is neutralised into the Japanese flap category. Second, adult
L2 learners perceive the same number of sounds as those produced in the L2
because L1 has the same number of sound categories. For example, the
perception of an L2 contrast as a corresponding contrast in the L1. This is
where phonetic differences between the L1 and L2 sound categories result in
slight differences in sound categorization, as in the case of French learners of
English /d/ and /t/ (Escudero 2005).

Phonemes in the notion of feature geometry are assumed to have an internal
structure that is composed of a hierarchy of phonological features that are
contained in the phonological component of Universal Grammar (Clements
1985). That is, the representation of a given sound in a given language is a
subset of universal feature geometry. According to Rice and Avery (1993),
the representation of a sound always makes it distinctive within a particular
language. Hence, Brown’s PIM aims to explain the influence of L1
phonology on the acquisition of L2 phonology, as well as identifying the level
of phonological knowledge involved in such L1 influence.
Furthermore, the findings of Brown’s study in which she tested the perception
of English /r/-/l/ contrast by Japanese and Chinese L2 learners supported her
PIM and feature geometry model (Brown 1998). The two English sounds
have different feature geometries. This difference is based on the feature
[coronal] which is present in the feature geometry of /r/ but absent in that of
/l/. The results revealed that Chinese learners were able to accurately perceive
the English contrast, whereas the Japanese learners were not. This is because
Chinese feature geometry has a [coronal] contrast in the form of alveolar
versus retroflex sibilants, whereas Japanese does not. Additionally, PIM and
the feature geometry model are supported also by the findings of Brown
(1998) and Matthews & Brown (1998) which revealed that Japanese speakers

32

learning English were unable to accurately discriminate between the contrasts
/r/-/l/ and /s/-/θ/ which are distinguished by the features [coronal] and
[distributed], respectively, both of which are absent in the Japanese feature
geometry.
Brown’s (1998) findings indicated that the difference between the Japanese
and Chinese performance in all of the tasks was related to the subjects’ L1,
and that this was the key factor. Also, no significant correlation was found
between the performance on all of the tasks and the number of years that
English had been studied in both groups.

2.5. L1 Feature Geometry
As was mentioned in the introductory chapter, L1 phonology can render L2
learners insensitive to certain properties of L2 input (Matthews & Brown
2004). As a result, L1 feature geometry constrains the acquisition of L2
segmental representations, leading to transfer of L1 properties into L2
acquisition (Brown 1998). Thus, Feature Geometry is the theory of segmental
representation that maintains that phonemes consist of distinctive features
that are organised into hierarchical constituents (Clements 1985). According
to the Feature Geometry theory, L1 perception and system is considered to be
the starting point of the L2 initial state, where L2 learners perceive only L1
perceptual categories in the L2 input. Two predictions can be made regarding
the starting point of the L2 perception scenario, which are the same two
scenarios that were mentioned in the PIM model.

Brown (1998) posits that the study of similar contrasts will not contribute to
the understanding of how a novel L2 representation is acquired, and that the
study of completely new contrasts, such as Zulu clicks, will only tell us
whether UG plays a role in L2 acquisition. Hence, Brown suggests that non-

33

native contrasts in which only one of the members is a phoneme in the
learner’s L1 should be the focus of future studies, due to the fact that it is the
only scenario in which L2 learners can be tested to investigate if they can
develop new L2 segments on the basis of already existing L1 features. The
present study is an attempt to fill the gap in both areas of research (first
exposure and L2 perception studies) by investigating the perception of nonnative contrastive sounds after first exposure to L2.

To sum up, L2 sound perception models and studies present two opposing
point of views. The first one holds that similar L2 sounds are easier to learn
than dissimilar ones, such as Brown’s PIM (1998, 2000), Best’s PAM (1995),
and Kuhl’s NLM (2000). The other point of view holds that similar L2 sounds
are difficult to learn, as in Flege’s SLM (1995, 2003). As mentioned earlier,
the first three models share the view that the presence of L2 sounds and
features in the L1 results in the absence of L2 perceptual learning problems.
However, the later assumes that native-like L2 perception is very difficult to
achieve.

This chapter thus far has reviewed first exposure studies and four models of
L2 perception, as well as the Feature Geometry theory. In the next section the
hypotheses and research questions are presented.

2.6. Hypotheses and Research Questions
Based on the previously mentioned research of Brown (1998) and (Matthews
& Brown 1998), it is hypothesised that L1 feature geometry mediates between
the incoming acoustic stimuli of a speech stream and the abstract linguistic
system, sorting the stimuli into phonemic perceptual categories (Matthews &
Brown 1998). That is, novel L2 phonemes that are distinguished by a feature
present in L1 phonology will be perceived more easily than those that are

34

distinguished by features absent in L1 phonology. Accordingly, the present
study’s research questions are as follows:

1. Which novel Arabic phonemes will be the least/most problematic to
be perceived by adult native speakers of English at first exposure to
Arabic? Can first exposure studies shed light on this?
2. Do the phonological features that distinguish languages affect the
perceptual capacities of L2 learners of other languages (perceptual
filtering)? That is, do L2 learners perceive L2 sounds the same way
that native speakers do or do they perceive the non-native contrasts as
the most similar L1 sounds?

35

Chapter Three
3. Methodology
3.1. The Study
The present study is based on the hypothesis that L1 English feature geometry
will mediate between the incoming acoustic stimuli of the speech stream of
Arabic L2, sorting the stimuli into phonemic perceptual categories (Brown
1998; Matthews & Brown 1998). That is, non-native Arabic L2 phonemes
that are distinguished by a feature present in L1 English phonology will be
discriminated and perceived more easily than those that are distinguished by
features absent in L1 English phonology. An experiment was thus designed
to investigate the effects of L1 English feature geometry on the accuracy of
L2 learners’ perception of novel L2 Arabic phonemic contrasts after first
exposure (Brown 1998; of Gullberg et al. 2010; Matthews & Brown 1998).

To assess the hypotheses, it was necessary to test for contrastive phonemic
pairs that are of four classifications, partially following Brown (1998) and
Matthews & Brown’s (1998) methods. The first is the contrastive phonemic
pair /b/-/d/, both of which exist in the phonemic inventory of both English
and Arabic. This pair also served as a control contrast for testing as will be
explained shortly. The second is the contrastive phonemic pair /x/-/ɣ/, where
both phonemes exist in Arabic but not in English. Nevertheless, the features
necessary to distinguish between /x/ and /ɣ/ are present in the feature
geometry of English, i.e., [dorsal], [voice] and [continuant] (Alotaibi &
Meftah 2013; Davenport & Hannahs 2010). The third and the fourth are the
contrastive phonemic pairs /ʔ/-/ʕ/ and /h/-/ħ/. All of the phonemes in these
two pairs are present in Arabic, however, only the first member of each pair
is present in English, i.e., /ʔ/ and /h/. Moreover, English feature geometry
lacks the retracted tongue root [RTR] feature entirely (Esling 1999), which is

36

a necessary feature to distinguish between the contrastive pairs /ʔ/-/ʕ/ and /h//ħ/ (McCarthy 1994). Thus, both of the phonemes /ʕ/ and /ħ/ along with the
distinctive feature [RTR] necessary to distinguish them are absent in English
phonology.

English was chosen as an L1 for the present study because all of the L2 Arabic
phonemes /ħ/, /ʕ/, /x/, and /ɣ/ do not exist in English, which provide a basis
for comparison to systematically test the effects of L1 feature geometry on
the perception of L2 non-native contrasts (Brown 1998). To the best of our
knowledge, there are no studies that have attempted such a comparison
between English L1 and Arabic L2 feature geometry before. Table 1 below
outlines the contrasting feature geometry in each pair and its presence in
English, Arabic or both. See Appendices 1 and 2 for the English and the
Arabic consonant phonemic inventories.

Furthermore, since this study also investigates English speakers’ first
exposure to novel Arabic L2 sounds, the experiment included a treatment in
the form of an Arabic weather report, partially following the methods of
Gullberg et al.’s first exposure study (2010). The input in the weather report
was controlled as to contain a balanced number of occurrences of the
phonemes in question.
3.1.1. Participants
43 adults participated in this study (17 males and 26 females), ranging in age
from 18 to 60 years old. The gender and age of the participants were not
variables. The participants were recruited electronically. The consent form,
the biographical data questionnaire, the treatment, and lastly the testing were
all delivered electronically through Google Forms, which provided an online
link that was distributed through emails, Twitter, and Facebook. Each
participant signed a consent form and completed a self-reporting biographical
data questionnaire to detect any prior exposure to or knowledge of Arabic
before proceeding to watching the weather report, which was followed by the
testing. As a control measure, participants were asked to indicate if they had
studied Linguistics to check for variables in their responses in comparison to
those who reported no prior study of linguistics. Those who had studied
Linguistics may have had an advantage over those who had not, which may
have led the participants to identify linguistic properties better than those who
had not. See Appendix 7 for the consent form, biographical data
questionnaire, treatment, and testing.

The 43 participants were divided into to three groups (cf. Brown 1998;
Matthews & Brown 1998). The first group was the native English L1 group
with no prior exposure to Arabic (n = 20), henceforth, English group. The
second group was the native English L1 group with prior exposure to Arabic

who reported either a pre-beginner or an intermediate level of Arabic as an
L2 (n = 10), henceforth, English+. Both of the first and the second groups
served as the experimental groups for the present study. Finally, a group of
native Arabic L1 speakers (n = 13) served as a control group, henceforth,
Arabic group. The three groups were recruited as such because finding
answers to our research questions requires comparing the perception accuracy
of the native English speakers (with no prior exposure to Arabic) with that of
the native English speakers who reported exposure to Arabic prior to the
testing. Thus, the comparison between the results of these two groups will
reveal whether prior exposure to Arabic plays a role in the perception
accuracy of the selected non-native phonemic contrasts. The Arabic control
group served as the basis on which the study relied on to validate the testing
procedure, compare the results with the first and second groups, and confirm,
refute or refine the present study’s hypotheses (cf. Brown 1998; Matthews &
Brown 1998). See Tables 2 and 3 for demographic information about the three
groups.

3.1.2. Input and Treatment
Inspired by Gullberg et al.’s study (2010), the treatment involved an audiovisual input of a genuine weather report in Arabic that was created by
ArabiaWeather.com and made available on YouTube. The weather report was
aided by gestural highlighting and was made available online to the
participants through Google Forms. The weather report was entirely in Arabic
and lasted for approximately five minutes. Care was taken in choosing this
specific weather report from YouTube to include a balanced number of
occurrences of the eight Arabic phonemes under investigation (see Appendix
5).
Participants were instructed to ensure that their computers’ speakers were
working properly and that they were sitting in a quiet place before watching
the weather report and before proceeding to listen to the test items. The
weather report and the test items were both delivered by a male native Arabic

40

speaker to control for variance in sound quality. See Appendices 4 and 6 for
the IPA phonetic transcription and English translation of the weather report.
3.1.3. Testing
An online test was presented at the end of the weather report to test the
participants’ perception of the eight selected Arabic contrastive phonemic
pairs. No pre-test was carried out in order to avoid revealing the focus of the
study to the participants. The participants were instructed to listen to 45
individual audio-video stimuli that corresponded to multiple-choice test items
in a randomized order as a control measure. Each stimulus consisted of
minimal Arabic pairs that differed only in their onset consonants, for
example, (baar/daar). Since the treatment was delivered by a male native
speaker of Arabic, for the sake of consistency and as a control measure, a
male native speaker of Arabic also produced all stimuli.

In order to be as naturalistic as possible, each test word containing the
phoneme under investigation was inserted in the following short phrase [qull
marra θaanija] ‘say

once again’, which was uttered by a

male native speaker of Arabic and recorded digitally using Audacity software.
The test words were then clipped and grouped into minimal pairs, e.g., /baar/
and /daar/. All audio files were then uploaded to YouTube in order to be used
in Google Forms. All tasks were AX discrimination tasks in which
participants were instructed to indicate as quickly and as accurately as
possible after listening to each audio-video stimulus of a minimal pair
whether each pair of test item contained two different words or two instances
of the same word by choosing ‘Same’ or ‘Different’ (Brown 1998; Matthews
& Brown 1998). According to Brown (1998), if an L2 learner does not
distinguish between two sounds in this type of a task, the assumption is that
the phonological representations of this learner’s L1 lack the necessary

41

structure to facilitate distinguishing between the two sounds. The answers
were tabulated into Excel spreadsheets through Google Forms in preparation
for analysis.

The 45 stimuli of minimal Arabic pairs were prepared for the three
experimental contrasts /ʔ/-/ʕ/, /h/-/ħ/, and /x/-/ɣ/. The contrast /b/-/d/ was also
included as a control contrast /b/-/d/ because both phonemes are present in
the phonemic inventory of both English and Arabic. As a result, all the
participants across the three different groups are expected to perform well in
the /b/ and /d/ contrast. Lastly, a group of identical pairs, which served as
foils, were included. The purpose of these foils was to ensure that
participants’ poor performance on the task was not because the task in itself
was difficult. If the task itself was difficult, then we would expect the
participants to perform poorly on the foil items as well (Brown 1998).

As for the experimental contrast /x/-/ɣ/, although they are not present in the
English phonemic inventory, the features [dorsal, voice, continuant], which
are necessary to distinguish them, are present in the English feature geometry.
Thus, the English participants in both English groups (i.e., English and
English+) are expected to perceive the /x/-/ɣ/ contrast with a high degree of
accuracy, although not as accurately as the Arabic participants because both
phonemes exist in Arabic.
In comparison, the non-native contrasts /h/-/ħ/ and /ʔ/-/ʕ/ are distinguished by
the feature [RTR], which is absent in the English feature geometry. This
means that not only the non-native phonemes /ħ/ and /ʕ/ are absent in English,
but also the feature necessary to distinguish them (i.e., [RTR]) is absent too.
Accordingly, the English participants (with no prior exposure to Arabic) are
expected to perform poorly. The English+ participants (with previous
exposure to Arabic) are expected to perform better than the English

42

participants (with no prior exposure to Arabic), but not as well as the Arabic
participants. See Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7 below for the minimal pairs for each
contrast.

Finally, six identical Arabic pairs were included (e.g. baan/baan) as a control
measure. The correct response for all the previously discussed stimuli items
is ‘Different’. However, the correct answer is ‘Same’ for these identical pairs.
If a participant responded incorrectly to these items with ‘Different’, it might
mean that he/she answered without listening to the audio, answered randomly,
or might be having hearing problems. Therefore, two participants, who did
not perform well in two or more of the six items, were eliminated before the
final number of participants was finalized to 43. See Table 8 below for the
identical pairs.

3.2. Preliminary Analysis
First, since /b/ and /d/ are sounds that exist in the phonemic inventory of both
English and Arabic, participants in all three groups are expected to distinguish
these sounds accurately. Second, non-native contrasts that are distinguished
by features present in the English feature geometry (i.e., /x/-/ɣ/) are predicted
to be discriminated and perceived accurately by the English speakers (both
the English group and the English+ group), though not as accurately as the
Arabic speakers. Third, non-native contrasts that are distinguished by features
absent in the English feature geometry (i.e., /h/-/ħ/ and /ʔ/-/ʕ/) are predicted
to be discriminated poorly by both English groups. The English+ group is,
however, predicted to be more accurate than the English group, but to be less
accurate the Arabic group.

4.1. Statistical Tests and Data Analysis
Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software package SPSS
version 20 for Windows. First, the data were described using descriptive
statistics (mean, median, and standard deviation) which were calculated to
describe the numerical quantitative variables in the answers, i.e., ‘Same’ or
‘Different’. Table 9 below shows the mean, median, and standard deviation
of the participants’ answers. In general, there are obvious differences between
the three groups’ results within the four different phonemic contrasts. For
instance, in the first phonemic contrast /ʔ/ and /ʕ/, we find that the Arabic
group had the highest scores, whereas the English group with no prior
exposure to Arabic had the lowest scores.

A normality test (Shapiro-Wilk Test) was run to determine whether the data
were normally distributed, which in turn determines which SPSS statistical
tests to be used. The results of the test indicated that the data were not
normally distributed, as will be explained below. Thus, the non-parametric

46

test Kruskal-Wallis was utilized to find out any significant differences
between the medians of the three groups’ results (English group, English+
group, and Arabic group). In addition, Maan Whitney test was utilized to find
out any significant differences between each two speaker groups separately.
In general, analysis tests’ results are considered significant when p < 0.05.
Finally, T test was utilized to find if the variable of having studied Linguistics
before could have affected the English groups’ results.

4.1.1. Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test
Shapiro-Wilk normality test is a numerical method of assessing data
normality, which is a powerful and more appropriate test for small sample
sizes (< 50 samples). Shapiro-Wilk normality test was run on the data
obtained from the three different speaker groups (English group, English+
group, and Arabic group). In data analysis in general, data from a particular
group is considered normally distributed if the data set from all speaker
groups had a p value > 0.05. In case of any violation of the normality
assumption of the data distribution in any speaker group or data set, the whole
set of data is considered not normally distributed. The data of all speaker
groups indicated that the data were not normally distributed (p < 0.05).
Therefore, as mentioned earlier, the non-parametric statistical tests KruskalWallis and Maan Whitney tests were utilized in the data analysis accordingly.
See Appendix 8 for the normality test results for the four different phonemic
contrasts and the identical pairs.

4.1.2. Kruskal-Wallis Test
The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was utilized in the analysis of the
present data because, as mentioned earlier, the data were found to be not

47

normally distributed. Kruskal-Wallis test was utilized to find out any
significant differences between the medians of the three speaker groups’
results (English group, English+ group, and Arabic group). In general,
analysis tests’ results are considered significant when p < 0.05. In this study,
the Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant differences between the medians
of the three speaker groups within the four different phonemic contrasts,
except for the identical pairs’ results where there were no significant
differences between the medians, which is not unexpected for a control
measure where all participants answered correctly with ‘Same’2. On the other
hand, in each minimal pair of the four phonemic contrasts the correct answer
is ‘Different’, whereas the answer ‘Same’ is considered an error.

Table 10 below shows the significant differences between the medians of the
three speaker groups. As can be seen in Table 10, the Arabic group
outperformed the other two groups (English group and English+ group) in all
the experimental phonemic contrasts as expected in the hypothesis (median =
2.00). Table 10 also shows that the English+ group outperformed the English
group in all the experimental phonemic contrasts as expected in the
hypothesis of the present study. Thus, the English group performed poorly in
comparison with the other two groups. The fact that the Arabic group
outperformed the other two groups while the English group performed the
worst in all the experimental phonemic contrasts supports the hypothesis that
L1 feature geometry alters L2 perception accuracy of non-native phonemes
and mediates between the incoming acoustic stimuli of the Arabic speech
stream, sorting the stimuli into phonemic perceptual categories leading to
inaccurate L2 perception of the non-native phonemic contrasts.

2

It must be noted that two of the participants had two or more wrong answers in the identical
pairs and were therefore eliminated and not included in the final number of the 43
participants.

Moreover, as predicted in the preliminary analysis of the results, the KruskalWallis test also revealed significant differences between the medians of the
three speaker groups across the experimental non-native phonemic contrasts,
as shown in Table 10 above. As previously anticipated, the non-native
experimental phonemic contrasts which are distinguished by features absent
in the English feature geometry (i.e., /ʔ/-/ʕ/ and /h/-/ħ/) were perceived less
accurately by both of the English groups compared to the Arabic group.
However, the English+ group was more accurate and performed better than
the English group, but less accurate than the Arabic group. As for the nonnative experimental phonemic contrast /x/-/ɣ/, which is distinguished by
features present in the English feature geometry, they were perceived by the
English speakers (both the English group and the English+ group) as
accurately as the Arabic speakers, as expected. In fact, the English+ group
had a perfect median score of a 2.00, which is exactly the same median score
for the Arabic group, while the English group had a near perfect median score
of 1.80. As for the control phonemic contrast /b/-/d/, where both phonemes
exist in the phonemic inventory of both English and Arabic, all three groups
were expected to distinguish these sounds accurately. However, the English
group surprisingly did not perform as expected in comparison to the other
non-native phonemic contrasts (see Table 10 above). The English group

49

scored a median of 1.36 in the control phonemic contrast /b/-/d/ as well as in
the experimental phonemic contrast /ʔ/-/ʕ/. The unexpected results of the
English group in the /b/-/d/ contrast will be discussed later. Next, the results
of the Maan Whitney test, which was utilized in order to evaluate and
compare the performance of each two speaker groups separately are
presented.

4.1.3. Maan Whitney Test
The non-parametric test Maan Whitney was utilized in the analysis of the
present data to compare the performance of each two speaker groups
separately. First, the English and the Arabic groups’ results will be presented
followed by the Arabic and English+ groups’ results and finally the English
and the English+ groups’ results. Table 11 below shows the significant
differences between the median scores of the English and Arabic groups
within the four different phonemic contrasts. The Arabic group significantly
outperformed the English group in all of the four different phonemic contrasts
with significant differences (p < 0.001) and (p < 0.002). With the exception
of the control phonemic contrast /b/-/d/, these results once again support the
hypothesis of this study, which states that non-native L2 phonemes that are
distinguished by a feature present in L1 phonology will be discriminated more
easily than those that are distinguished by features absent in L1 phonology.
For the identical pairs, there was no significant difference as explained earlier.
As with the Kruskal-Wallis results discussed above, there was a significant
difference between the English and Arabic groups with respect to the control
phonemic contrast /b/-/d/, which is unexpected since both phonemes exist in
both English and Arabic. These surprising results of /b/-/d/ contrast will be
discussed later.

Table 12 below shows the differences between the median scores of the
Arabic and English+ groups within the four different phonemic contrasts. As
can be seen, the differences between the medians of the two speaker groups
with respect to the experimental phonemic contrasts /ʔ/-/ʕ/ and /h/-/ħ/ are
significant (p < 0.001). That is, the Arabic group significantly outperformed
the English+ group in both phonemic contrasts, as expected by the hypothesis.
In contrast, there was no significant difference in the results of the
experimental phonemic contrast /x/-/ɣ/ between the Arabic and English+
groups. Once again, these results support the hypothesis that non-native L2
phonemes that are distinguished by a feature present in L1 phonology will be
discriminated more easily than those that are distinguished by features absent
in L1 phonology. As for the control phonemic contrast /b/-/d/, there was a
significant difference between the English+ and Arabic groups, which is
unexpected since both phonemes exist in both English and Arabic. Again, the
surprising results of /b/-/d/ contrast will be discussed later.

The final comparison is between the English and English+ groups. Table 13
below shows that the median score of the English+ group is significantly
greater than that of the English group with respect to the experimental
phonemic contrast /ʔ/-/ʕ/ (p = 0.008). This result in particular suggests that
prior exposure to Arabic has played a positive role in the English+ group’s
perception of this non-native phonemic contrast, given the fact that they are
distinguished by the feature [RTR], which is an absent feature in the English
feature geometry. As for the rest of the phonemic contrasts there were no
significant differences. Nevertheless, the English+ group outperformed the
English group as predicted earlier in all the experimental phonemic contrasts.
Once again, these differences, although not significant, might be attributed to
the English+ group’ prior exposure to Arabic. That is, it shows that there is a
considerable difference between the accurate L2 perception of the L2 learners
at first exposure and L2 learners with prior exposure to L2. Thus, the present
study shows that first exposure studies could shed light on the differences
between the L2 accurate perception of L2 learners at first exposure and L2
learners with prior exposure to L2 and also support the notion that L1
phonology may be the only knowledge contributing to L2 phonological
perception at first exposure. This is because the accurate knowledge of L2
sounds can only emerge from the learner’s ability to perceive such sounds
correctly and to form appropriate representations of them after exposure
(Brown 1998; Gullberg et al. 2010).

4.1.4. T Test
As mentioned in the previous chapter, participants were asked in the
biographical data questionnaire to indicate (by choosing Yes or No) if they
had studied linguistics to check for variables in their responses in comparison
to those who reported no prior study of linguistics. This control measure was
included to rule out the possibility that the participants’ results were
influenced by studying Linguistics. Those who had studied Linguistics before
may have an advantage over those who had not, which may lead the
participants to be able to identify linguistic properties better than those who
had not studied it before. The results of this variable were found to be
normally distributed in the normality test. Therefore, T test was utilized to
find out if there was any significant difference between the means of ‘Yes’
and ‘No’. Table 14 below shows that there was no significant difference
between the means of the two sub-groups (p value = 0.455). This result
suggests that studying Linguistics did not influence participants’ responses3.

5. Discussion and Conclusion
5.1. General Discussion
In summary, the present results revealed that there were significant
differences between the performances of the three speaker groups within the
four different phonemic contrasts (see Figure 1 below). The performance of
the English group was the worst in the perception of the non-native phonemic
contrasts in comparison with the English+ group. Figure 2 below shows that
the English+ group outperformed the English group in all four phonemic
contrasts, however, the only significant difference between the two groups
appears to be in the /ʔ/-/ʕ/ contrast, which suggests that previous exposure to
Arabic as an L2 facilitated the accurate perception of the contrasts in question.
In comparison, the Arabic group significantly outperformed the English
group across all phonemic contrasts (see Figure 3 below). Moreover, the
Arabic group significantly outperformed the English+ group across all
phonemic contrasts except for the /x/-/ɣ/ contrast (see Figure 4 below). Thus,
the hypothesis of this present study that L1 feature geometry alters L2
perception accuracy of non-native phonemes leading to inaccurate L2
perception of the non-native phonemic contrasts is supported. Additionally,
the results of this study provide further support to the findings of Brown
(1998) and Matthews & Brown (1998) that Japanese speakers learning
English were unable to accurately discriminate between the contrasts /l/-/r/
and /s/-/θ/ which are distinguished by the features [coronal] and [distributed],
respectively, both of which are absent in the Japanese feature geometry. As
mentioned in the literature review, Brown hypothesized that ‘speakers of a
given L1 are only able to perceive those non-native contrasts which are
distinguished by a feature present in their L1 grammar’ (1998: 170). So far,

54

the results of the present study support Brown’s hypothesis and present an
answer to this study’s research questions.

The first research question in this study sought to determine which novel
Arabic phonemes will be the least/most problematic to be perceived by adult
native speakers of English after first exposure to Arabic. The results of this
study suggest that the least problematic L2 non-native Arabic phonemes to
perceive are the phonemes /x/ and /ɣ/. This is because despite the fact that
they do not exist in English, they are distinguished by the features [dorsal,
voice, continuant], all of which are present in the English feature geometry.
On the other hand, the most problematic phonemes are /ʕ/ and /ħ/. This is due
to the fact that these phonemes are distinguished by the feature [RTR], which
is an absent feature in the English feature geometry.

The second research question that was presented by this study was whether
the phonological properties that distinguish languages act as a perceptual
filter affecting the perceptual capacities of L2 learners. On the basis of the
present results, it appears that L1 English phonological properties do act as a
perceptual filter that filters the Arabic L2 input causing the Arabic L2 learners
to perceive only those sounds that are distinguished by phonological features
that are present in English. This perceptual filter seems to be most present at
first exposure to L2 Arabic, which is evident in the results of the English
group with no prior exposure to Arabic in comparison to the results of the
English+ group, who had some exposure to Arabic. Also, the English group
poor performance is suggested to be caused by perceiving the non-native
contrasts as the most similar L1 sounds (Rochet 1995). Specifically, the
participants in the English group appear to perceive the Arabic phoneme /ʕ/
as its closest English counterpart /ʔ/, whereas the Arabic phoneme /ħ/ is
perceived as its closest English counterpart /h/.

57

Once again, the present results are supported by Brown’s study of the
perception of the English /r/-/l/ contrast by Japanese and Chinese listeners
(1998). According to Brown, the Chinese learners were able to accurately
perceive the English contrast /r/-/l/ whereas the Japanese learners were not.
This due to the fact that Chinese has the feature [coronal] in the Chinese
feature geometry, which is necessary to support this contrast, whereas the
Japanese feature geometry does not.

Now we turn to discuss the irregularities that were found in the results
regarding the perception accuracy of the /b/-/d/ contrast. As mentioned from
the beginning of this study, this contrast was included as a control phonemic
contrast because both phonemes exist in the phonemic inventory of both
English and Arabic. As a result, all the participants across the three different
groups were expected to perceive them accurately. Contrary to expectations,
however, the English group and the English+ group unexpectedly performed
poorly in the /b/-/d/ contrast in comparison to the other non-native phonemic
contrasts, whereas the Arabic group performed successfully as expected. As
can be seen from Table 10 above repeated below as Table 15, while the Arabic
group had a perfect median score of 2.00 in the control phonemic contrast /b//d/ (as well as in the other experimental phonemic contrasts), the English
group had a median score of only 1.36, whereas the English+ group was
slightly better with a median score of 1.57. Table 15 also shows that the
differences between the three groups with respect to the /b/-/d/ contrast is
significant (p < 0.001).

It is unclear at this point why the participants in the English and English+
groups performed poorly in the control contrast /b/-/d/. If all the participants
in all three groups performed equally poorly in the control contrast /b/-/d/,
then one might argue that there was a problem with the experiment itself.
Nevertheless, the fact that the performance of the participants in the Arabic
group was perfect in the control contrast /b/-/d/ (and for that matter in all of
the three experimental contrasts) is a strong indication that the experiment in
and of itself was not flawed. Thus, the unexpected poor performance of the
English group and the slightly better performance of the English+ group
cannot be attributed to a flaw or weakness in the experiment itself (Figure 5
below).

A possible explanation for this might be that although /b/ and /d/ exist in the
phonemic inventory of both English and Arabic, however, it is conceivable
that there may be some fine or subtle phonetic/acoustic differences between
these phonemes in each language which caused the English and English+
groups to perform poorly since all of the test items were produced by a native
speaker of Arabic. This explanation is supported by the fact that the English+
group performed better in the control /b/-/d/ contrast (and in all of the three
experimental contrasts as well) compared to the English group, which is a
strong indication that prior exposure to Arabic played a positive role in the
perception of both the control contrast and the experimental contrasts. This
rather unexpected finding is one of the advantages of comparing first
exposure learners with learners with prior exposure in a first exposure study.

It must be noted, however, that this remains inconclusive at this point and
requires further research and analysis. Specifically, further research should be
undertaken to investigate the differences between /b/ and /d/ in English and
Arabic. The investigation may also be extended to cover all the phonemes
that are shared between the two languages. This may shed some light on what
phonemes may be used as a control contrast in future studies.

5.2. Conclusion
The present study was an attempt to replicate Brown (1998) and Matthews
and Brown's study (1998) of Japanese and Chinese speakers’ perception of
selected L2 English sounds in an AX discrimination task. The key strengths
of the present study are twofold. Firstly, eight Arabic phonemes (/b, d, x, ɣ,
ʔ, ʕ, h, and ħ/) were carefully selected to test for the effects of English L1
feature geometry on the perception of Arabic L2 phonemes. These Arabic
sounds were divided into three groups. The first group consisted of phonemes
that exist in English and Arabic, i.e., /b/-/d/. The second group consisted of

60

phonemes that do not exist in English but are distinguished by features that
are present in English, i.e., /x/-/ɣ/. The third group consisted of the phonemic
contrasts /ʔ/-/ʕ/ and /h/-/ħ/ that are distinguished by an absent feature in
English [RTR], even though /ʔ/ and /h/ are present in English as phonemes.

The second strength of this study is that it compared the perception of native
speakers of English who have never been exposed to Arabic with that of
native speakers of English who reported prior exposure to Arabic in a first
exposure study. The purpose of this is to compare the results of the two groups
at L2 Arabic initial exposure. As previously mentioned, there is no study so
far that has attempted such a comparison of L1 and L2 feature geometries and
L2 perception of non-native sounds in a first exposure study. Thus, it is hoped
that this study contributes to our knowledge of this essential aspect of L2
acquisition and serves as a base for future studies.
Overall, the results obtained have reaffirmed Brown's model of L2 speech
perception and L1 feature geometry (1998). That is, the perception of L2 nonnative contrasts is constrained by the phonological features present in the
learners’ L1 feature geometry. The Arabic control group, as expected,
demonstrated the highest level of success in identifying all of the selected
eight Arabic phonemes in the AX discrimination tasks. Additionally, the
results of the English+ group (with prior exposure to Arabic) revealed a level
of awareness of the target sounds as compared to the results of the English
group. This seems to support Brown's argument for the establishment of a
new feature geometry of the L2 as learners are trained to distinguish the
phonemic features that are distinctive in the L2. According to Brown (1998),
high-level learners can be taught to discriminate and distinguish sounds in the
L2 category where, over time, a new feature geometry for the L2 sounds will
be established within the learners’ linguistic system. As for the English group
(with no prior exposure to Arabic), their performance was the worst in the

61

perception of the non-native phonemic contrasts in comparison with the
English+ group. Once again, this confirms Brown’s (1998) argument that L1
feature geometry filters the L2 input and eliminates the ability to perceive
cues in the acoustic signal, and that the L2 initial state is the L1 phonological
structure. That is, L1 feature geometry is the starting point of L2 acquisition.

As mentioned in the literature review, L2 perception at first exposure is equal
to that of L1 (Escudero 2005) and that the perception of L2 non-native
contrasts is constrained by the phonological features of L1. The present study
revealed that English learners of Arabic as L2 at first exposure to Arabic were
constrained by English L1 feature geometry, which acted as the initial L2
phonological system. Moreover, they were able to accurately perceive the /x//ɣ/ contrast more than the /ʔ/-/ʕ/ and /h/-/ħ/ contrasts because the former
contrast is differentiated by a feature present in the English feature geometry,
i.e., [dorsal, voice, continuant]. On the other hand, the /ʔ/-/ʕ/ and /h/-/ħ/
contrasts were not accurately perceived by the English learners of Arabic
because of the absence of the relevant necessary phonological feature in
English, i.e., retracted tongue root [RTR].
The results of the AX discrimination task of the phonemic contrasts /ʔ/-/ʕ/
and /h/-/ħ/ obtained from the three speaker groups (English, English+, and
Arabic) confirmed the hypothesis of the this study that native English
speakers do in fact find the most difficulty in perceiving novel Arabic sounds
which consist of feature(s) absent in the feature geometry of the L1 English,
viz., [RTR]. Likewise, the results obtained from the three speaker groups with
respect to the phonemic contrast /x/-/ɣ/ confirmed the hypothesis of the this
study that native English speakers do not encounter difficulties in perceiving
novel Arabic sounds which consist of feature(s) present in the feature
geometry of the L1 English, viz., [dorsal, voice, continuant].

62

It must be noted also that the significant difference between the performance
of the English and English+ groups in this first exposure study suggests that
the L2 perception of adult learners gradually adjust to match that of the
targeted L2 (Escudero 2005). These results generally suggest that adult
learners with no prior exposure to L2 could acquire some of the L2
phonological representation, which is consistent with the results of other
studies of first exposure studies such as Gullberg et al. (2010). The present
results are also consistent with the findings of Onishi et al. (2002) who tested
whether phonotactic regularities that are not present in English could be
acquired by adult English speakers after first exposure. Their findings
demonstrated that phonotactic constraints are rapidly learned from brief
auditory experience and that some constraints are more easily learned than
others.

As previously mentioned, there are two opposing point of views regarding
the perception of L2 sounds. On the one hand, Best (1995), Kuhl (2000), Lado
(1957), and Brown (1998, 2000) argue that difficulties in learning a novel L2
phoneme is linked to the absence of this phoneme in the learners’ L1. Flege
(1995), on the other hand, argues that novel phonemes can be easily acquired
while similar phonemes are difficult to be acquired. The findings of the
present study are consistent with the first view, particularly Brown’s PIM and
L1 feature geometry (1998, 2000).

Given the different point of views of L2 perception and their findings, it is
clear that adult L2 learners, constrained by their language-specific perception,
encounter significant L2 perceptual difficulties and that some of these
difficulties may persist over a period of time (Strange & Shafer 2008).
Nevertheless, understanding the nature of such L2 perceptual difficulties at
first exposure and predicting which L2 sounds will be the least/most difficult
to be perceived in comparison with a given L1 are key to provide insight on

63

the nature of L2 acquisition, and also on adult L2 learners’ performance
difficulties and the factors that influence the degree of L2 foreign accents.
Identifying such problems is equally appreciated by L2 teachers and learners
as it opens new opportunities in designing L2 learning experiences that are
specifically tailored to a particular L2 learners of a given L1, which in turn
facilitates L2 acquisition (Piske, MacKay and Flege 2001). Clearly, this has
implications on the pedagogical approaches of language teaching
methodologies depending on the difference between different L1s and L2s. It
is, therefore, hoped that this study will provide some insight into the initial
state of Arabic L2 learning by English native speakers.

5.2.1. Limitations and Future Recommendations
One source of weakness of this study which might have affected the results is
the small sample size of participants. That is, a larger sample size may have
produced different and more statistically representative results. An additional
weakness of this study is the fact that the testing conditions were uncontrolled
for as participants took the test online at their own convenience. Thus, there
might be some external factors (such as noise, sound quality, etc.) which
might have affected their performance.

In light of the weaknesses of this study, it is, thus, recommended that future
studies should take into account including a larger sample size. In addition,
it is recommended that testing be carried out in a controlled computer lab
environment to eliminate any factors that might affect the performance of the
participants. In addition, future studies are recommended to design
experiments which incorporate speech production tasks. This might yield
invaluable data which may further reaffirm Brown's hypothesis. It might also
be interesting for future research to conduct longitudinal studies to investigate

64

and document the progress of English learners of Arabic from the L2 initial
state to L2 ultimate attainment.

Appendix 6: English translation of the Arabic weather report
1. Dear viewers of Arab weather
2. May God bless your day.
3. Together we will follow on the Latest developments of the tropical
storm Ashoba.
4. As can be seen from the images captured and received today at Arab
Weather of the gathering clouds;
5. The storm continues as the accompanying clouds cover most of the
Arabian Sea.
6. Moreover, most of these high clouds, which circle around the storm,
have been seen in the Sultanate of Oman and some areas of the
United Arab of Emirates.
7. However, these clouds are unlikely to carry rain, as they are far
away from the heart of the storm over the Arabian Sea.
8. As the for the path of the storm, it is expected that the areas that are
likely to be affected by the storm according to the latest updates;
9. we can see that the storm has moved during the past 24 hours
towards the northwest
10. That is between Monday and Tuesday it moved toward the
northwest.
11. and it is expected, according to data and numerical maps models
powered by Arab weather, that the storm will continue to move in
the same direction, towards the west and northwest
12. It is expected to reach the Omani coast on Wednesday and Thursday
13. where the most impacts from this weather condition will affect parts
of the Sultanate of Oman, God’s willing.
14. more clouds are expected to gather on Wednesday and Thursday
15. increasing the chances of rainfall.

82

16. rainfall intensity will vary on the southern and eastern parts of the
Sultanate of Oman.
17. Also wind speed is going to be over the standard speed.
18. also sea level is expected to rise
19. with higher waves along the coasts of Sultanate of Oman
20. and along the Emirates coast and the Sea of Oman
21. The latest updates show that the Emirates will generally be far from
the immediate effects of this storm.
22. the impact would be limited to higher sea level and higher waves
23. on the east coast.
24. However, wind speed will cause dust storms that will lead to as low
visibility
25. which will increase the possibility of forming more clouds over the
eastern mountains and some of the desert areas.
26. This weather condition calls for launching a series of warnings over
the Sultanate of Oman. The first warning is
27. the danger of the rains and floods as a result of heavy precipitation in
the southern and eastern parts of the Sultanate
28. Second: the danger of the intensity of the wind speed and the
damages that may result from it.
29. The third: from going to the sea as it will be a dangerous as result of
high waves and strong wind
30. and the forth is; low visibility as a result of the dust and dirt.
31. we advise all concerned to take precautious measures
32. Dear viewers, you can follow-up on the latest updates via our
website arabiaweather.com
33. Also the Arab's weather app for smartphones.
34. And our pages in social media.
35. May God keep you all safe and thank you.
