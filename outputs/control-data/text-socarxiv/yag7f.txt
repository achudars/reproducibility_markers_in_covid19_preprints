ABSTRACT
Since “women and politics” scholarship emerged in the 1970s, social, institutional, and
theoretical developments have shaped the trajectory of U.S. scholarship in this field. First, the
presence of women in U.S. formal politics has increased, albeit unevenly across the country and
over time. Simultaneously, the capacity to study ‘political women’ has become supported
through institutional mechanisms such as academic journals and communities of practice.
Moreover, gender as a critical focus of analysis has been developed and refined. In the literature
on women and politics, the shift from studying sex differences to interrogating gendered political
institutions is especially salient. This institutional focus, along with recent intersectional studies
of gender and politics, increases opportunities for cross-pollination of sociological and political
science perspectives. In this review, I provide a brief history of the U.S. scholarship on gender
and politics and map these relevant social, institutional, and theoretical developments. I highlight
the value of recent intersectional contributions in this field and make the case for bringing
partisanship – an increasingly salient political identity and structure – into intersectional
approaches to gender and politics.

1. INTRODUCTION
The United States, which has a below-world average percentage of women in its
Congress, lags behind most developed democracies on measures of women’s political
representation (Dahlerup, 2018; IPU, 2018). In 2018, women comprised 20.6 percent of the U.S.
Congress’s 535 members; 23.7 percent of statewide elective executive offices; and 25.4 percent
of all state legislative seats nationwide (CAWP, 2019a). Black women held 3.6 percent of
Congressional seats and 3.7 percent of state legislative seats in the same year, on average
(CAWP, 2018). Despite Stacey Abrams’ hard-fought gubernatorial race in Georgia in 2018, no
black women have ever served as governor in any U.S. state. Latinx elected officials filled just
over seven percent of the seats in the 115th Congress; ten of them were women (NALEO, 2019).
Asian Pacific American (APA) congress members comprise just over three percent of the U.S.
House and Senate; over two-thirds of these APA federal legislators are women (APAICS, 2019).
Moreover, in the unprecedentedly diverse incoming class of U.S. congress members elected in
2018, the majority of women and racial minorities identified with the Democratic Party
(Viebeck, 2018).
Gender and politics, a now-robust field, has been analyzing gender inequalities in
politics since the 1970s. In the half-century since this area of scholarship was founded, women’s
political representation and approaches for studying it have seen tremendous change. To-date,
the vast majority of research on the surging numbers of women in politics has been done under
the aegis of political science. However, feminist political sociologists have contended that
“sociology has much to offer the study of gender and politics,” (Paxton & Hughes, 2013, 3). In
the spirit of further bridging disciplinary gaps, this review maps the relevant social, institutional,
and theoretical developments in gender and politics studies and synthesizes the institutional and

2

intersectional approaches where there is promise for synergy between sociology and political
science going forward.
Below, I begin by briefly reviewing three major developments in the gender and politics
literature. Having done so, I move on to highlight the intersectional approaches that are now
moving scholarship in this area forward. I argue that intersectional studies of gendered political
institutions offer insights into the complex relations of power in the constantly changing political
field. In particular, I call attention to the structure of party politics and the dramatic shifts in
party polarization in the U.S., which have received relatively little attention in gender and
politics scholarship. Intersectionality provides a framework for understanding the complex
interplay between the structure of partisanship and inequalities in representative politics.
2. A BRIEF HISTORY OF U.S. WOMEN AND POLITICS SCHOLARSHIP
Women were absent from most research on U.S. political actors prior to the 1970s.
Historically, the political arena – and concomitantly, literature on political leaders – has been
dominated by men (except see Addams, 1920; Breckinridge, 1938). Sociologist Seymour Martin
Lipset’s Political Man (1960) exemplifies this broad erasure of women. When women’s politics
was recognized (e.g., Duverger, 1955), it was viewed as inherently exceptional (Walby, 1988).
The dearth of research on women in political positions reflects the exclusion of women at this
time from both U.S. politics and universities (Deegan, 1988).
The Center for American Women and Politics, the first research center devoted to the
study of U.S. women politicians, was founded in 1971. Its establishment was crucial to the
emergent literature on women and politics, because previously “no one had bothered to count
[women in state legislatures]. They were few and far between, hardly enough to consider a
phenomenon worthy of study” (CAWP, 2017). The new Center, supported by the Ford

3

Foundation, held an inaugural conference for Women in State Legislatures in 1972 (O’Dea
Schenken, 1999). The effect of the conference was twofold: It brought together a network of
women in elective office from across the U.S. for the first time, and it inspired several
foundational academic works on women in politics. Soon after CAWP’s establishment, Jeane
Kirkpatrick’s Political Woman (1974), Jane Jaquette’s Women in Politics (1974), Jo Freeman’s
The Politics of Women’s Liberation (1975), and Irene Diamond’s Sex Roles in the State House
(1977) arrived to set a new academic agenda. These books are widely regarded as the germinal
works on “women in politics” (Wolbrecht, 2008).
Over the course of more than four decades, there have been large gains in American
women’s social, political, and economic equality in a variety of arenas. Addressing all of these is
beyond the scope of this paper, but three developments have advanced the now-robust area of
gender and politics. Two are structural changes to the political and academic environment, while
the other centers on the flourishing of more advanced theoretical approaches. From a pragmatic
standpoint, increases in the number of women in U.S. legislatures (and other political offices)
greatly expanded the universe of objects of study, and this change was complemented by the
institutionalization of the subfield of gender and politics, particularly through academic networks
and journals. The field has benefitted greatly from the work of feminist scholars who
transformed the study of sex difference into a more critical analysis of gender and social
relations of power in institutions. Below, I explain how these developments affect the scope and
focus of research questions available to present-day scholars interested in gender inequalities in
political representation.
2.1 Rising Numbers of Women in Politics, 1977-2019

4

Shares of state and national legislative seats held by women have increased dramatically
since the late 1970s, and gender change has been uneven among minority groups. At the state
level, the number of women representatives more than doubled between the late 1970s and the
turn of the millennium, although the share of seats held by women in state assemblies and
senates has on average remained unchanged since 2000 (CAWP, 2019a). The pace of change in
legislative representation has differed among minority women: For instance, between 1990 and
2010, the number of Latinx state legislators increased from 8.9 percent to 14.1 percent; Latina
legislators only occasionally comprise half of states’ Latinx representatives over this time period,
such as in Nevada in the 1990s (Ramírez & Burlingame, 2016). At the level of statewide
executive office (e.g., governors, attorney general, secretary of state), Black women have been
better represented compared to APA and Latina women; two-thirds of U.S. states have never
elected a woman of color to statewide executive office (Sanbonmatsu, 2016). The first openly
gay woman to achieve any statewide office was elected Massachusetts’ attorney general in 2014
(CAWP, 2019b). Trends in federal representation of women since the 1970s also demonstrate
intracategorical differences: While the number of all Congresswomen increased more than fivefold between 1979 and 2019 – from 20 to 110 (CAWP, 2019a), the share of congressional seats
held by Black women decreased between 1979 and 1990. After more than doubling in the early
1990s, the number of Black women in Congress has since slowly risen to 39 (CAWP, 2018).
The overall increase in U.S. women legislators tracks major trends in women’s political
empowerment worldwide. The United Nations Decade for Women, designated as from 1975 to
1985, contributed to global awareness of women’s rights (Paxton, Hughes & Green, 2006) and
was followed by the Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995 that set an international
agenda for state actions advancing gender equality (Olcott, 2017; Tripp, 2006). In the U.S.,

5

Geraldine Ferraro became the first woman to appear on a major political party’s national ticket
as the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee in 1984. Less than one decade later, a record of 47
women were elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in the 1992 general election, in what is
now commonly known as “The Year of the Woman” (Cook, Thomas & Wilcox, 1994). After a
notable stall in gender change in U.S. representative politics, Hillary Clinton became the
Democratic presidential nominee in 2016 – a first for any major U.S. party. Women’s activism
shortly after this election in response to conservative policies on issues such as immigration
(Filler, 2018) and violence against women in many fields, including politics, led to a “Women’s
March” in 2016 and a “pink wave” of women running for political offices from the local to the
national level in 2018 (Dittmar, 2018).
Women’s increased presence in legislatures has expanded the universe of study for
answering the question of whether descriptive representation yields substantive effects for
democracy (Reingold, 2008). We know from comparative research that women’s descriptive
representation does not always lead to substantive progress for women’s rights in all contexts
(Beckwith & Cowell-Meyers, 2007; Schwindt-Bayer, 2006; Tripp, forthcoming). As Mala Htun
and S. Laurel Weldon point out, gender equality in politics is “not a project that can be pursued
in a single domain or at a single point in time” (2018, 256). Nevertheless, representative politics
is one domain that can effect change in gender governance. For instance, researchers have found
that the visibility of women in political leadership roles has a “role model effect” (Campbell &
Wolbrecht, 2006). Moreover, having more women at the top has symbolic significance for social
movements that advocate for gender justice (Kenney, 2010) and for open and inclusive
democratic institutions (Dahlerup, 2018).
2.2 Academic Institutional Capacity-Building

6

Pragmatically, the expansion of support in academic disciplines for the study of political
women has improved research and raised the profile of this field. Women (and later – gender)
and politics scholarship became institutionalized through the founding of several academic
associations and journals. In turn, these venues for feminist discourse created networks of
scholars and enhanced the capacity of feminist scholars in sociology and political science to
study gender politics.
After the pioneering books in the nascent field of women and politics were published,
feminist scholars built academic infrastructure to record and distribute research. Women &
Politics (now the Journal of Women, Politics & Policy), the first journal dedicated solely as an
outlet for studies on women and politics, was published for the first time in 1980. Sociologists
for Women in Society (SWS) was formed at the 1970 winter meeting of the American
Sociological Association (Ferree, Khan & Morimoto, 2007) and broke with ASA to publish its
journal, Gender & Society, independently in 1987. The editors of the journal Social Politics
introduced its first issue in 1994 by calling for more work that reexamines “familiar discussions
of state, market, family, and civil society” (Hobson, Michel & Orloff, 1994, 2) through a gender
lens. The International Journal of Feminist Politics published its first issues in 1999 and Politics
& Gender – the official journal of the APSA Section for Women and Politics Research – was
founded in 2005 (Tolleson-Rinehart & Carroll, 2006).
Most recently, the European Journal of Politics and Gender published its first volume in
2018. It is notable that in the first issue’s editorial the founding editors laid out a commitment to
“intersectionality as a political objective” (Ahrens et al., 2018). Such journals are not merely
outlets for individual publications. Their development has cultivated a network of scholars, set
research agendas for the young field, and fostered legitimacy for the study of gender and politics.

7

2.3 Gender and Gendered Institutions
The feminist revolution in academic disciplines (Scott, 1986; Smith, 1974) transformed
the research questions available to scholars of politics and gender. The late 1970s and early
1980s was an especially critical time period in political feminist thought. One of the earliest
interventions was Lopata and Thorne’s (1978) critique of the Parsonian term “sex roles” which
had assumed stable, functional, and apolitical gender categories. Not a decade later, Stacey and
Thorne’s (1985) influential essay on the “Missing Feminist Revolution in Sociology” drew
attention to the subversion of feminist work by mainstream sociology through its
misappropriation of gender as merely a category or variable. Since these critical theoretical
advances, feminist research on politics has shifted away from studying women as a homogenous
category to analyzing gender as dynamic relations of power in institutions (Connell, 1987;
Lorber 1994; Scott, 1986).
Feminist sociologists have been especially effective at politicizing how gender structures
major institutions in society, such as the economy and the state (Martin, 2004; Risman, 2004).
Research on organizations has benefitted from theoretical contributions that explain how the
gendered logic of organizational practices contributes to inequalities in leadership and mobility
at work (Acker, 1992; Britton, 1997; Ridgeway, 2011; Williams, 2013). For instance, Schilt’s
(2010) research on transmen at work demonstrates how gender creates a system of boundaries
that organizes professional social relations and access to organizational resources. Similarly,
access to state power – through policymaking and social movements – is constrained by contextspecific gender regimes and gender politics (Brush, 2003; Ferree, 2012; O’Connor, Orloff &
Shaver, 1999).

8

Scholarship on gender in political science has also taken up a focus on gendered
institutions (Hawkesworth 2003; Kenney 1996). In feminist policy studies, the discursive
institutionalist approach has been widely used. Fraser’s (1989) research on “needs talk” and
Bacchi’s (1999) approach to the construction of policy problems both highlight how gender
constrains state social programs. This approach has contributed to intersectional research on
strategies for diversity mainstreaming (Verloo, 2006). Feminist institutionalism (FI) combines
the insights of critical feminist scholars with the new institutionalist approach (Mackay, Kenny
& Chappell, 2010). The basic premise of FI is that all institutions are gendered. Gender patterns
the formal and informal “rules of the game” in political institutions, such as the structure of
electoral systems (Kenworthy & Malami, 1999; Matland & Studlar, 1996; Norris, 2006), the
division of labor in political agencies (Chappell & Waylen, 2013), and candidate recruitment in
political parties (Bjarnegård & Kenny, 2016; Fox & Lawless, 2010).
Conceptualizing gender as an institution offers opportunities for productive dialogue
between scholars trained in sociology and in political science by directing attention to
organizational norms and institutional practices (Mackay, Monro & Waylen, 2009). Indeed, FI
has informed compelling sociological studies on gender and politics, such as Bolzendahl’s
(2014) comparison of how the institutionalization of gender varies among national legislatures,
using Germany, Sweden, and the United States as cases. FI can be usefully applied at the local
level of politics as well: In their study of a volunteer state legislature, Matthews & Lively (2017)
elaborate how gender shapes informal practices of balancing work and family in nonprofessional legislative contexts.
3. INTERSECTIONALITY AND POLITICS

9

The evolution of “gender and politics” – as a subfield and a community of scholarship –
has challenged the literatures on politics and political representation that were not previously
gender-critical. The conjunction of feminist and critical race scholarship has stimulated new
questions by encouraging scholarship on intersectionality. In the following section, I first address
what intersectionality is and how it has developed as an approach to studying politics and power.
Then, I illustrate how intersectional perspectives have made inroads into research on political
actors and processes and research on power relations in political institutions. Finally, I argue that
progress in these areas provides a model for adding partisanship – an increasingly salient
political identity and structural condition for governance – to intersectional frameworks.
3.1 Intersectionality
Black feminist legal scholar Kimberlé Crenshaw is credited with coining the term
intersectionality (1991), but the idea of race and gender being more than separate identities or
processes of inequality emerged from black women’s activism in the 1960s (Nash, 2011). As the
concept of intersectionality has travelled, its exact meaning has been contested. According to
Collins & Bilge (2016), intersectionality is “a way of understanding and analyzing the
complexity in the world, in people, and in human experiences” (2016, 2). Intersectionality has
also been called an “analytic disposition” (Cho, Crenshaw & McCall, 2013, 795) and a “research
paradigm” (Hancock, 2007) that is defined by its attention to multiple non-additive identities and
structures that affect relations of power in society.
Early works by intersectionality scholars shaped the trajectory of research on politics in
the 1990s onwards. Crenshaw’s (1991) article emphasized political intersectionality in
conceptualizations of rape and intersectional representations of violence against women in
politics. In particular, she cites Anita Hill’s testimony in the Senate confirmation hearings of

10

Clarence Thomas as an example of complexity in political inequalities and assessments of
injustice. Patricia Hill Collins writes in Black Feminist Thought (2000[1990]) of the insider
resistance of women of color in domains of power, such as the academy. Scholars doing
comparative work have extended intersectionality’s political potential outside the U.S. context.
Parreñas (2001) and Garcia-del Moral & Korteweg (2012) both apply intersectional approaches
to explain how gender, nationality, race, and class differently position people in relation to state
structures. Even in the U.S., Evelyn Nakano Glenn (2002) draws on regional case comparisons
of the South, Southwest, and Hawaii to analyze how major political and economic institutions in
American society have historically been organized simultaneously but differently on the basis of
race, gender, and class.
Intersectionality’s reach in gender scholarship has been broad. In the literature on gender,
policy, and politics, in particular, intersectional discourse and approaches have been used widely
(Collins & Chepp, 2013; Harnois, 2015; Kantola & Nousiainen, 2009) in spite of methodological
obstacles to accounting for intersectionality in quantitative research (Dubrow, 2013; Hughes,
2013). I will focus my review on how intersectional approaches have changed the research
questions about and understandings of 1) political actors and processes, as well 2) political
institutions.
3.2 Political Actors and Processes at the Intersection
Intersectional approaches have taken different forms as the literature on gender and
politics has expanded. Early intersectional approaches in the gender and politics literature
focused especially on what Choo & Ferree (2010) call inclusion and process-centered
applications of intersectionality. The former includes studies that do the important work of
complicating “women” as heterogeneous political actors (Cammisa & Reingold, 2004; Brown &

11

Gershon, 2016). For instance, in her interviews with African American women serving in state
legislatures, Smooth (2011) challenges “which women” the policies commonly associated with
“women’s interests” represent. In this way, intersectionality can unpack within-group or intracategorical complexity (McCall, 2005) among women in politics.
Process-centered approaches explore the effects of electoral and legislative practices on
gender and racial inequality. Intersectional approaches to political processes can be informative
about both the input (candidates and legislators) and output (policy) of representative politics. In
an experimental study of voter perceptions of Black female candidates, Carew (2016)
demonstrates how colorism affects voter behavior and shapes which women of color get elected.
Hawkesworth (2003) applies an intersectional approach to the internal operations of legislatures:
once elected, legislative practices such as exclusion and obstructionism affect the practical
representation of minority groups. Studying the “output” of politics, scholars have drawn on
intersectionality to unpack the effects of divergent understandings between policymakers, their
constituents, and interest groups about notions like fatherhood (Haney & March, 2003),
victimhood (Bernstein 2010; Jacobsen & Stenvoll, 2010) and violence against women
(Armstrong, Gleckman-Krut & Johnson, 2018; Whittier, 2016).
3.3 Intersectionality, Institutions, and Politics
Recently, scholars have brought macro-level factors into interaction to explain
intersectional puzzles with respect to political institutions. Intersectionality works from the
premise that power relations between groups and organizations interact to produce complex
inequalities in society (Mügge & Erzeel, 2016). Scholars using intersectional perspectives
analyze not only the multiple jeopardy facing minority groups (King, 1988); they are also
interested in the practices and opportunity structures that reinforce the hegemony of dominant

12

groups in political institutions (Childs & Hughes, 2018; Hughes, 2013; Swain & Lien, 2017). I
hold up contributions to the robust study of gender quota laws to demonstrate how intersectional
approaches complicate understandings of inequalities in political institutions.
Quota policies aim to enhance or guarantee some level of descriptive representation
(Pitkin, 1967) of a social group by institutional rule changes. Gender quotas have been adopted
by political parties and national assemblies in over half of the world’s countries (Dahlerup,
2018). Minority quotas, while less common than gender quotas, are active in more than 20
countries worldwide (Htun, 2004). One puzzle is how these policies affect the political
representation of women and ethnic minorities together and separately (Hughes, 2011). For
instance, in Bolivia the indigenous-led government adopted a gender parity electoral law but
granted indigenous groups a near-negligible five percent reserved parliamentary seats. Htun &
Ossa (2013) bring together factors such as differences in coalition unity and party interests to
explain this inequitable outcome. Similarly, Celis et al. (2014) find that quotas alone do not
explain the electoral success of ethnic minority women in Belgium and the Netherlands. The
institutionalization of gender and ethnicity quotas within parties and efforts of party elites to
maximize electoral support based on masculinized stereotypes of ethnic threat interact to produce
complex effects in different contexts.
A notable benefit of an institutional intersectional approach to politics – especially with
respect to gender and race – is that it can explain complex outcomes of politics. In the words of
Orloff, Ray & Savci (2016, 8), democratic politics is “multiple and… inescapably contentious.”
Therefore, there will be unanticipated consequences of any state-institutionalized feminist
policies (Roychowdhury, 2016). For instance, Tripp (forthcoming) illustrates how the motivation
to pass women’s rights provisions in the MENA region is related to the symbolic politics that

13

signal modernity to other nations. Moreover, the practical achievement of women’s
empowerment is uneven based on context-specific factors, such as religion and legacies of
colonialism. Strolovitch & Crowder (2018) contend that “intersectionally responsible
representation” must recognize such perversities, and how they are tied up with stereotypes and
hegemonic notions of citizenship.
4. BRINGING PARTISANSHIP INTO INTERSECTIONALITY
Intersectionality has transformed the study of gender and politics in recent years.
However, as Carastathis (2016) argues, intersectionality is a provisional concept meant to
challenge continuously how scholars think with respect to social identities, relations, and
structures. As such, there is room for intersectionality to bring together relevant social structures
and political identities beyond the often-invoked gender, race, class, and sexuality. I argue that
bringing partisanship into intersectional studies of gender and politics helps make sense of
contemporary mechanisms of intersectional inequality in political representation. This section
will first define partisanship – as an identity and as a structure – and explain its significance in
the U.S. political system. Then, I synthesize the work – primarily by feminist political scientists
– that has treated partisanship as an axis of oppression in line with intersectionality.
Partisanship, in the words of Green, Palmquist & Schickler (2002) is “a double entendre”
with meanings at the micro as well as the macro level. In their micro-level “hearts and minds”
approach, partisanship is the identification of individuals with political parties. Partisan social
identities carry affective as well as symbolic meaning for voters. At the macro level, partisanship
describes the party coalitions that interact with other social institutions (Aldrich, 2011; Cohen et
al., 2008). Partisanship has taken on a uniquely dichotomous form in U.S. politics where two

14

major parties dominate in a first-past-the-post system, aside from intermittently disruptive minor
parties and factions (Hirano & Snyder, 2007; Skocpol & Williamson, 2012).
Partisan identities and the structure of party politics have become increasingly salient
with growing party polarization. Polarization describes the ideological movement of parties away
from the political center (DiMaggio, Evans & Bryson, 1996). There is strong evidence of party
polarization among elected representatives in the U.S. (Fiorina & Abrams, 2008; Heatherington,
2001). Among the voting public, experimental research has found levels of affective hostility and
discrimination based on political party and on race that are similar in magnitude (Iyengar &
Westwood, 2015). Information about demographic trends that apparently undercut white political
dominance has also been shown to affect attitudes and voting intentions (Craig & Richeson,
2017). Since party identities and party structures are increasingly polarized in U.S. politics (but
not only in the U.S., see Geva, 2019), intersectional approaches to gender and politics need to
better address how political inequalities are produced at the nexus of gender, sex, race, and party.
Early research on the partisan “gender gap” (Kaufmann & Petrocik, 1999; Inglehart &
Norris, 2000) brought attention to the intersection of these complex social structures. However,
in public opinion surveys, “gender” is often conflated with sex, leaving findings about partisan
gender gaps imprecise (Bittner & Goodyear-Grant, 2017). Furthermore, the language of a
partisan gender “gap” masks the complex mechanisms by which the structures of party politics
and gender produce inequalities in political representation, and how these structures interact with
sexuality, race/ethnicity, and class. Research with an intersectional approach to including
partisanship offers improved models to explain the complex outcomes in this area of gender and
politics.

15

Political parties shape the “inputs” and “outputs” of representative politics in formal and
informal ways. In terms of who is elected, formal mechanisms such as voluntary party quotas
(Baldez, 2006; Dahlerup, 2018) and party leadership positions (Kunovich & Paxton, 2005;
O’Brien, 2015) all have the potential to affect women’s representation in politics depending on
the national electoral system. Informal factors such as party culture (Barnes & Cassese, 2017;
Elder, 2012; Freeman, 1986) also shape intersectional disparities in representation across and
within political parties. Party-motivated violence against women in politics may affect the tenure
of women politicians' careers (Kuperberg, 2018). Partisanship also shapes the output of politics
in concrete policy terms and with respect to diverse constituents’ trust in their elected
representatives. Where quotas (and in particular, party quotas) have now existed long enough to
evaluate their effects, evidence is accumulating that changes in legislative demographics affect
substantive outcomes (Bratton, Haynie & Reingold, 2006; Clayton & Zetterberg, 2018;
Franceschet & Piscopo, 2008). Partisanship also affects constituents with diverse backgrounds’
perceptions of their elected representatives and the trustworthiness of democratic systems
(Barnes & Beaulieu, 2019; English, Pearson & Strolovitch, 2018). These bodies of research lead
the way in bringing partisanship into intersectional approaches to gender and politics.
5. CONCLUSION
Democratic institutions whose elected members do not represent their constituents are
longstanding social problems. Research done by feminist political scientists and sociologists has
provided better ways of understanding of how gender inequalities in politics are reproduced.
Moreover, we have evidence that addressing these institutional problems yields results:
Increasing the descriptive representation of women in decision-making positions has symbolic
importance as well as substantive repercussions for policy and trust in democratic institutions.

16

Scholars’ capacities to explore gender as a “critical problematic” (Ritter, 2008) in political
institutions is now supported by an established foundation of research, academic networks and
journals that have the capacity to grant status and set agendas for gender and politics research,
and an expanded universe of women and people of color in politics to study. Just as the field of
“women and politics” was transformed after the 1970s through theoretical, institutional, and
social developments, the future of gender and politics depends also on changes in these realms.
This review has called for two (nested) theoretical advances. Intersectionality’s political
potential has just begun to be engaged in the recently institutionalized and still expanding field of
gender and politics. In highlighting the contributions of intersectional approaches to political
actors, processes, and institutions, I have also argued for bringing partisanship into intersectional
analyses, both as an identity and structure of growing relevance in contemporary U.S. politics.
Partisanship, like gender and race, is best understood as continuously constructed through
relations of power rather than as a binary concept. Bringing partisanship in to intersectional
approaches is not without challenges. Many critical scholars caution that intersectionality, an
approach rooted in the academic labor of black feminists, has been used in colorblind ways
(Alexander-Floyd, 2012; Carbado, 2013) and even as a buzzword (Davis, 2008) with the
approach losing its critical edge as it travels into mainstream scholarship. As such, intersectional
gender and politics research is best accomplished when researchers engage in scholarly
reflexivity at the individual and disciplinary levels.
The academic journals and associations created around the study of gender and politics
provide a foundation of institutional support for innovation. Nevertheless, scholars of gender and
politics – especially in political science – face persistent challenges within their male dominated
disciplines (Mershon & Walsh, 2016; Romero, 2017; Tolleson-Rinehart & Carroll, 2006;

17

Weldon, 2018). For instance, a special issue of The Legislative Scholar in winter 2019 addresses
the underrepresentation of women in legislative studies. To remedy the myriad of challenges
facing inclusiveness in this field, many contributors to this issue call for greater mentorship of
and networking opportunities for women and ethnic minorities in this field (e.g., Caballero,
Jackson & Brown, 2019; Swers, 2019). In addition, studies of legislative politics and political
parties that incorporate literature featured in this review should not be understood as the
responsibility of already-marginalized scholars. What all scholars and teachers “in the pipeline”
learn about intersectional inequalities will shape the trajectory of citation practices and
disciplinary recognition.
Finally, recent social changes in political institutions generate many exciting new
research questions for scholars of gender and politics to address with intersectional approaches.
The 116th U.S. Congress began its first session in 2019 as the most diverse in history, with 117 of
its members identifying as nonwhite, 127 identifying as women, and ten identifying as gender
queer (Cohen, Rundlett & Wellemeyer, 2019). How will this unprecedented diversity among
U.S. elected representatives affect the substantive representation of minority group interests?
How will it challenge or change institutional structures of party leadership or individual partisan
identities? How are changing structures of partisanship – in interaction with gender, race, class,
and sexuality – supporting or undermining hegemonic power relations in politics? By joining
intersectional perspectives on inequality with feminist institutionalist approaches to structures of
power operation both formally and informally, researchers in both sociology and political
science can contribute to identifying fruitful paths to more inclusive politics.
