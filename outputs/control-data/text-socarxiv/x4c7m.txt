The transition to fatherhood and men’s health

The Transition to Fatherhood and the Health of Men.

Objective: This study examines the impact of fatherhood on diverse health behaviors and
outcomes among a representative sample of Millennial men in the Unites States.
Background: Much research explores the consequences of parenthood for women, but we know
less about health outcomes and trajectories of men who become fathers. Theoretical approaches
suggest both health-enhancing changes driven by social control and a new father identity, and
health-decreasing changes driven by the costs and burdens of fatherhood.
Method: The NLSY97 longitudinal survey and a battery of novel fixed effects models are used
to identify the consequences of paternity on diverse health outcomes, controlling for selectivity
based on unobserved characteristics and unobserved trajectories of men who become fathers and
accounting for heterogeneity of effects.
Results: Becoming a father induces weight gain and a decline in self-reported health, but
reduces alcohol consumption. Effects on weight and alcohol use varied across strata defined by
race and education, but changes in self-reported health were consistent across sub-groups.
Conclusion: The transition to fatherhood induces changes in health outcomes and behaviors that
are both positive and negative. These consequences are not transitory. Rather, they persist over
men’s early adulthood.
Implications: Fatherhood induces health-related changes that endure over the first years after
becoming a father, and which may contribute to morbidity and mortality in late adulthood.

The transition to fatherhood and the health of men.
INTRODUCTION
Becoming a parent is an important life-course transition with effects spanning many
domains of life, including economic attainment, stress, relationship quality, and physical and
mental wellbeing (Clausen 1986; Cowan and Cowan 1992; Nomaguchi and Milkie 2017;
Umberson, Pudrovska, and Reczek 2010). These effects are generally more salient for women
than men. Not only do women bear the physiological demands of carrying and nursing children,
but gendered social expectations result in their bearing the greater share of parental
responsibilities and rewards (Musick, Meier, and Flood 2016). Compared to fathers, mothers
undertake more parental responsibilities (Doucet 2009; Hochschild 2012), report higher stress
(Meier et al. 2018), experience greater financial distress (Bird 1997), and contend with
employment discrimination (Correll, Benard, and Paik 2007). Given such direct consequences, a
connection between parenthood and health seems more obvious for mothers than fathers.
Nevertheless, the transition to parenthood may also affect men in several domains of life
(Eggebeen and Knoester 2001).
This analysis examines the effect of fatherhood on health behaviors and outcomes. To
date, the majority of evidence comparing health outcomes between fathers and childless men is
associational (Bird 1997; Eggebeen and Knoester 2001; Evenson and Simon 2005; Keizer,
Dykstra, and Poortman 2010; Mirowsky 2002; Umberson 1987). This scholarship provides
valuable descriptive findings, but this evidence is only suggestive. An emergent literature uses
causal inference approaches to disentangle the effect of fatherhood from unobserved correlates
(Garfield et al. 2016; Kerr et al. 2011; Knoester and Eggebeen 2006; Pudrovska 2008; Ross,

2

Mirowsky, and Goldsteen 1990; Syrda 2017; Umberson et al. 2011; Wolfe 2009). However, the
extant literature faces three important challenges.
One challenge in understanding the paternity-health nexus is that research has tended to
focus on specific health outcomes at a time across varied populations and has found diverse
effects, rendering it difficult to piece together a comprehensive picture. For example, consistent
with the notion of a protective fatherhood effect, parenthood predicts lower morbidity and
mortality (Bungum et al. 2018; Modig et al. 2017), and leads to a decline in binge drinking
(Wolfe 2009). One study also finds beneficial effects of fatherhood on substance use among
socioeconomically disadvantaged men (Kerr et al. 2011). In contrast, others find that fatherhood
has negative effects, such as weight gain (Garfield et al. 2016; Syrda 2017; Umberson et al.
2011). Taken together, it is unclear whether findings about positive and negative effects stem
from simultaneous processes or simply reflect differences across generational or socioeconomic
contexts. Studies examining the effect of fatherhood on psychological well-being suggest that
this life transition carries both costs and rewards, with potentially offsetting effects (Hansen
2012; Nomaguchi 2012; Nomaguchi and Milkie 2003), and it is indeed plausible that
fatherhood’s effects on physical health are similarly wide-ranging. However, developing a full
picture of how a life transition affects physical health requires an assessment of various health
indicators, as well as heterogeneities across sub-groups, within the same population (Daw,
Margolis, and Wright 2017).
Another challenge lies in extrapolating findings from prior research to understand the
health risks faced by new fathers in the 21st century. Broad economic and cultural
transformations have changed the incidence and the meaning of fatherhood in recent decades
(Goldscheider, Bernhardt, and Lappegård 2015; Marsiglio and Roy 2012). With shifting gender

3

attitudes, American fathers today experience greater involvement with their children (Carlson,
Vanorman, and Turner 2017; Pleck 2004; Samuel 2016) and assume more childcare
responsibilities than they did in the past (Goldscheider et al. 2015; Pleck and Masciadrelli 2004),
even in context of persistent differences in childcare between fathers and mothers (Musick et al.
2016) and beliefs that mothers are better-suited to a caregiver role (Doucet 2009). Since the
1980s, emergent norms such as “involved fathering” have placed a growing emphasis on parents’
close involvement in children’s day-to-day lives (Hays 1996; Milkie and Denny 2014).
Furthermore, younger cohorts of fathers came of age in a tumultuous economic context marked
by the Great Recession and decline in fertility rates (Seltzer 2019). These economic and
normative transformations may have altered the experience of fatherhood, which calls for an
updated understanding of the paternity-health nexus.
The third challenge is the selectivity of men who eventually become fathers. These men
could differ in terms of unobserved characteristics such as health endowments or personality.
They could also differ in terms of pre-fatherhood trajectories from those who remain childless,
resulting in a spurious association between the transition to parenthood and health. A recent body
of research attempts to directly address this challenge using longitudinal or sibling data (Garfield
et al. 2016; Kerr et al. 2011; Knoester and Eggebeen 2006; Pudrovska 2008; Syrda 2017;
Umberson et al. 2011; Wolfe 2009). While this scholarship has made important strides to
account for unobserved traits that are stable over time, it leaves open the risk of spurious
trajectories associated with fatherhood. For example, if men who “clean up their act” and reduce
alcohol consumption early in their life-course because of factors other than fatherhood also
become fathers earlier (Duncan, England, and Wilkerson 2006), a spurious association between
fatherhood and alcohol use will emerge (Bruderl and Ludwig 2014; Wooldridge 2002:315–22).

4

Others have suggested that some major life events such as fatherhood may have transitory rather
than permanent effects (Dougherty 2006; Myrskylä and Margolis 2014). A robust assessment of
the effects of paternity entails both accounting for life-course trajectories starting before the
transition to fatherhood as well as distinguishing enduring from transient effects.
We address these challenges by considering the association between fatherhood and a
range of health indicators, including body weight, alcohol consumption, smoking, marijuana and
other drugs use, and self-rated health, and assess heterogeneity of these effects across different
contexts of fatherhood. Our analysis examines a cohort of American men born in the 1980s, who
belong to the so-called Millennial generation and came of age in the early 21 st century. In order
to address unobserved selectivity of men who become fathers, we estimate a battery of novel
fixed effects models for longitudinal data. While no research design short of an implausible
large-scale experiment randomly allocating fatherhood to men would conclusively capture causal
effects, the combination of several fixed effects models based on diverse assumptions provides
plausible causal estimates. We use terms such as “results” and “consequences” when interpreting
findings, but the reader should be aware that we cannot irrefutably assert causality.

BACKGROUND AND THEORY
Research on the association between fatherhood and mortality consistently suggests a
protective effect of parenthood (Bungum et al. 2018; Modig et al. 2017). However, the bulk of
the literature also shows that health and wellbeing are lower among parents than non-parents,
especially among parents with young children living at home. While women appear to be more
affected, worse physical and psychological wellbeing is also observed among fathers compared

5

to childless men (Bird 1997; Hansen 2012; McLanahan and Adams 1987; Nomaguchi and
Milkie 2017).
The possibility of both health-enhancing and health-decreasing consequences of
fatherhood is not a surprise for scholars of the family, who understand fatherhood as a “bundle”
that brings both costs and rewards (Hansen 2012; Nomaguchi 2012; Nomaguchi and Milkie
2003). Becoming a father involves substantial psychological, financial, and social costs (Bird
1997; Evenson and Simon 2005; Nomaguchi and Milkie 2003). In addition to the financial
burden and strain, parenting entails fatigue, sleep deprivation, and loss of personal freedom (Bird
1997; Pollmann-Schult 2014; Twenge, Campbell, and Foster 2003). Fatherhood could also carry
marital and relationships costs. Even as some studies suggest that fatherhood improves
relationship quality improves for a small share of men (Doss et al. 2009; Twenge et al. 2003),
research generally finds that transitioning to parenthood is accompanied by an average decline in
relationship quality (Bird 1997; Lawrence et al. 2008; Twenge et al. 2003) due to role conflict
and restricted freedom (Twenge et al. 2003), increased burden of household labor (Keizer and
Schenk 2012), and decline in shared leisure (Claxton and Perry-Jenkins 2008). Given these
corollaries, stress theory predicts negative health consequences of paternity. Specifically, stress
can affect weight (Dallman et al. 2003), smoking (Slopen et al. 2013), drug and alcohol addiction
(Volkow et al. 2011), and immunity (Schneiderman, Ironson, and Siegel 2005). Moreover, by
imposing competing demands on time, the new role could reduce opportunities for physical
exercise, contributing to weight gain (Nomaguchi and Bianchi 2004; Palkovitz 2002).
At the same time, the literature indicates that the transition to fatherhood provides a
source of social integration and social control, and reshapes identity. In addition to the new tie
with the child, the transition could strengthen community networks, and induce a novel sense of

6

role-based responsibilities. These changes are likely to promote health-enhancing behaviors
through internalization of social norms and role expectations, and to provide a source of meaning
and purpose that is protective against self-harming behavior such as smoking, excessive
drinking, and substance use (Reczek et al. 2014; Umberson 1987; Umberson and Montez 2010).
For instance, a study of new Canadian parents found that men were motivated to quit smoking in
order to align themselves with an identity of “competent and concerned fathers” (Bottorff et al.
2009:189). Likewise, internalizing the role expectations of paternity predicted lower rates of
substance use, accompanied by improved physical and mental health, among disadvantaged
American fathers (Knoester, Petts, and Eggebeen 2007). American fathers also report spending
less time socializing outside their immediate community due to time and money constraints, as
well as the non-child-friendly nature of many gendered social activities (Eggebeen and Knoester
2001; Palkovitz 2002; Rözer, Poortman, and Mollenhorst 2017).
Heterogeneity in the effect of fatherhood on health outcomes: The effects of
becoming a father are likely shaped by the contexts embedding the transition to fatherhood
(Umberson et al. 2010), and could therefore be contingent upon factors that define the salience,
constraints, and expectations associated with the parental role. We therefore consider several
potential sources of heterogeneity, including the following:
Education: Education is a central source of health disparities, reflecting underlying
differences in financial and psychosocial resources, healthcare access, and stressors (Ross and
Mirowsky 2010). Lower education is associated with fewer economic resources and higher
economic uncertainty, which can be a key source of distress among parents (Bird 1997;
Pollmann-Schult 2014). This could exacerbate the negative consequences of fatherhood for
health among less educated men. Additionally, fatherhood could be more beneficial for the

7

health-related behaviors of men with lower education because it moves them away from
potentially risky life trajectories. For instance, (Sampson and Laub 1990:611) argue that social
bonds to “adult institutions of informal social control”, such as family, move at-risk men away
from deviant pathways. Consistent with this argument, Kerr et al. (2011) found that fatherhood
led to a decline in all types of non-normative behavior among at-risk men, including engagement
in crime, drug use, and smoking. In sum, while some literature suggests variation across
education and other measures of socioeconomic standing, the direction of such variation is very
much an open question. To assess heterogeneity by educational resources, we distinguish men
with a high school education or less, and those with more than a high school diploma.
Race/Ethnicity: To date, there has been little examination of race-ethnic variation in the
consequences of fatherhood (Eggebeen, Knoester, and McDaniel 2013), especially in populationrepresentative quantitative research. In the United States, Black and Hispanic fathers are
substantially more likely to have lower levels of education, to be unmarried, and not to co-reside
with children (Carlson, VanOrman, and Pilkauskas 2013). As such, racial variation could be
driven by a compositional effect in terms of these underlying attributes. In order to provide an
assessment of patterns of difference we consider non-Hispanic Black, non-Hispanic White and
Hispanic fathers. In ancillary analyses, we also examine effects in sub-samples defined by the
intersection of race/ethnicity and education.
Age of transition into fatherhood: The life-course approach suggests that events in individuals’
lives are interrelated and affect each other depending on the age and context in which men
experience them (Elder 1994; Roy 2014; Umberson et al. 2010). While the health effects of
becoming a father potentially vary by the timing of parenthood, there are no universal age
thresholds defining early or late transitions across social contexts and wellbeing outcomes. In

8

general, research suggests that transitions prior to age 20 can truncate educational and
occupational opportunities (Bamishigbin, Dunkel Schetter, and Stanton 2019) and transitions 5
years before the cohort average are associated with loss of supportive social ties (Rözer et al.
2017). Likewise, younger fathers have worse health outcomes: becoming a father before age 21
is associated with poorer physical health (Mirowsky 2002; Taylor 2009) and paternity before age
23 is linked with higher depressive symptoms (Mirowsky and Ross 2002). Conversely, men who
become fathers after age 25 have lower morbidity risk (Hanson, Smith, and Zimmer 2015). In
longitudinal studies, weight gain is somewhat accelerated among men who have their first child
earlier or later than about age 27 (Umberson et al. 2011), but other health risks appear not to be
sensitive to the timing of parenthood (Garfield et al. 2016; Wolfe 2009), and an early transition
into fatherhood has been found to be “rational and sound” for some men (Booth, Rustenbach,
and McHale 2008). To analyze potential differences by age of transition into parenthood, we
distinguish men who made the transition to fatherhood at age 21 or earlier, at ages 22-27, and
after age 27. These thresholds roughly map onto the youngest and oldest 25 percent of transitions
in our sample.
Marital status: While marriage appears to be beneficial for men’s health and wellbeing
(Rendall et al. 2011; Waite and Gallagher 2000; Williams 2003) the consequence of fatherhood
appear to vary little between married and unmarried men. When differences emerge, they
suggest that the transition to fatherhood impairs health and wellbeing for single men (Hansen
2012; Umberson and Gove 1989) but has “little influence on the lives of married men”
(Nomaguchi and Milkie 2003:356). However, these findings mostly refer to the late 20th century
and might need to be updated if the increased demands for “involved fathering” have resulted in
stronger impact of fatherhood on married Millennial men. Furthermore, while scholars have

9

traditionally defined partnership status based on marriage, Woo and Raley (2005) argue that this
distinction might be inadequate in the context of growing cohabitation and show that, at least
among women, subjective wellbeing following parental transitions declines for cohabiters, but
not for married and single parents. We therefore examine the consequences of fatherhood across
married, cohabiting, and unpartnered men, based on relationship status at the time of firth birth.
A time-varying covariate captures subsequent changes in partnership status.
Co-residential status: Given that residential fathers spend more time with children than
non-resident fathers, and that culturally-prescribed role expectations apply more directly to
resident parents, we can expect health effects to be stronger among co-residential fathers
(Knoester and Eggebeen 2006; Umberson 1987; Umberson and Gove 1989). However, some
empirical evidence suggests minimal differences between types of fathers (Eggebeen and
Knoester 2001; Garfield et al. 2016; Knoester and Eggebeen 2006; Knoester et al. 2007). We
examine heterogeneity by residence among biological fathers at the time of first birth. By the
final survey wave, 86 percent of fathers who were resident during the transition to parenthood
remained residential, whereas 50 percent of the fathers who were non-residential at the time of
first birth eventually became residential fathers. We do not separately analyze non-biological
fathers as they constitute only 3.5 percent of our sample.
A note on methodological challenges in the study of fatherhood effects. Capturing the
effect of fatherhood is challenging for several reasons. First, men who become fathers could
differ from those who do not, based on unobserved characteristics such as personality, health
endowments, preferences, or family background. If panel data are available, fixed effects models
can be used to account for these sources of confounding as long as the differences between
fathers and non-fathers do not change over time.

10

However, confounding could also emerge if changes in men’s health affect their
probability of becoming a father, leading to reverse causality. For instance, men who quit alcohol
or drug use earlier in life may be more attractive childbearing partners and thus may be more
likely to become fathers. An observed association between health-related behaviors and
fatherhood would then be misinterpreted as an effect of becoming a father. An additional way in
which changes over time may induce confounding is that becoming a father is usually part of a
broader process of transition to adulthood that involves changes in multiple domains. Different
men experience this process at different ages and in heterogeneous sequences (Rindfuss 1991;
Shanahan 2000). Heterogeneity in the transition to adulthood induces the risk of spuriousness if
some individuals experience fatherhood and change health behaviors early in their lives, while
others experience these transitions later for reasons other than an actual effect of one transition
on the other. We use a battery of conventional and novel fixed effects models to address, as best
as possible in context of observational data, these diverse sources of confounding.
In sum, becoming a father is likely to bring costs and rewards, which could result in both
positive and negative consequences for men’s health (Hansen 2012; Nomaguchi 2012;
Nomaguchi and Milkie 2003). Based on prior literature, we expect the transition to fatherhood to
have health-decreasing consequences such as weight gain, and health-enhancing corollaries, such
as reduced smoking, drinking, and drug use. These consequences are likely shaped by the
contexts embedding the transition to fatherhood, leading to heterogeneity based on the life course
features of fatherhood and the socioeconomic resources of men.

DATA AND ANALYTICAL STRATEGY

11

Data: We use the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth
(https://www.nlsinfo.org/content/cohorts/nlsy97), a nationally representative dataset of men and
women living in the United States born between 1980 and 1984, making them the older segment
of the so-called Millennial generation. The sample consists of 4,599 men, aged 12-18 at the time
of the first interview in 1997. The survey was conducted annually between 1997-2011, and
biennially between 2011-2015, constituting 17 rounds. In our analytical sample, we include men
when they turn 17 years old who become fathers or remain childless during the period of
observation. By the 2015 survey wave, respondents were 33-36 years of age. We apply
NLSY97-provided custom weights appropriate for analysis of data in “any or all years”. The
sample size varies slightly across outcomes because data on some outcomes are not collected in
all waves, and because of question non-response.
Variables: We examine diverse health outcomes and behaviors, including body weight,
self-reported health, alcohol consumption, smoking, marijuana use, and using “hard drugs”
(cocaine, crack, heroin, or other substance not prescribed by a doctor used to get high or achieve
an altered state). Table 1 describes the operationalization of these outcome variables. Alcohol,
marijuana, and smoking were measured as days of usage in prior month. We use a dichotomous
formulation because the strongly bimodal distributions (smoking, marijuana) or extreme rightskew (alcohol) render these measures unsuitable for treatment as continuous variables.
[Table 1 about here]
Analytical strategy: We estimate a battery of fixed effects models for panel data using
linear regression models. The main predictor in all models is fatherhood status (1=father,
0=childless). The main analysis considers biological fathers regardless of co-residence with the
child. All models include time-varying covariates to control for changes in men’s lives

12

potentially accounting both for fatherhood and health outcomes: men’s age and its square,
education measured in years of completed schooling, and men’s partnership status. Partnership
status distinguishes never married, married, cohabiter, and previously married (widowed,
separated, or divorced). Controlling for changes in partnership status is particularly critical to
avoid confounding because the literature has shown that marriage predicts men’s mortality,
alcohol and drug consumption, and risk-taking behavior (Duncan et al. 2006; Waite and
Gallagher 2000), and that cohabitation may play a distinct role from either marriage and
singlehood (Mernitz and Dush 2016; Perelli-Harris et al. 2018; Woo and Raley 2005). Finally,
we add year fixed effects to account for changes in the historical context.
Models: We start with a conventional individual and time fixed effects formulation, in
which the outcome for individual i in time t is modeled as follows:
𝑂𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽1 𝐹𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡2 + 𝑿′𝑖𝑡 𝛽4 + 𝐴𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡

(1)

where O identifies the outcome of interest, Fit identifies fatherhood status, Xit is the vector of
time-varying covariates, Ai identifies the individual fixed effect terms and  is an idiosyncratic
error term. The Ai fixed effects terms control for all (observed and unobserved) confounders that
are constant over time such as men’s health endowments and personality, and yield a causal
estimate under the “temporal heterogeneity” assumption that, conditional on covariates, men do
not experience changes shaping their health other than fatherhood (Bruderl and Ludwig 2014).
Temporal homogeneity is a strong assumption. To weaken this assumption, we retain men
observed as non-fathers during the entire period of observation in the analytical sample. Nonfathers can be thought of as a control group that serves as a longitudinal counterfactual. This
control group provides an estimate of the time trend in the outcome in the absence of “treatment”
(fatherhood), which is differenced out from the within comparison in the treatment group. As
13

such, we do not need to assume that nothing relevant changes over time, but only that the time
trends are parallel in the treatment and control group, also known as the “common trends”
assumption (Angrist and Pischke 2009).
However, men who do not become fathers may provide a poor longitudinal
counterfactual for those who do. To address this risk, we estimate a version of fixed effects
models that allows for different trends in the outcome for those who become fathers and those
who do not. This model is known as group-specific fixed effects model (FEGS), where the
groups are men who are ever fathers and those who are never fathers.
𝑂𝑖𝑡 = 𝛾1 𝐹𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾2 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝛾3 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡2 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡′ 𝛾4 + 𝐴𝑖 + 𝛾5 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 ∗ 𝐸𝑣𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑖 + 𝛾6 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡2 ∗ 𝐸𝑣𝑒𝑟𝐹𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡
(2)
The FEGS model includes interaction terms between an indicator identifying men who
eventually become fathers (EverFi) and age and its square. By adding these interaction terms, the
FEGS model accounts for different age trajectories in health outcomes among those who became
fathers during the period of observation and those who did not.
The FEGS model is based on the assumption that the only source of unobserved
heterogeneity in trajectories over time is between men who ever and never became fathers
(Ludwig and Brüderl 2018). This assumption might be too restrictive if there are diverse
transitions to adulthood that affect both the timing of fatherhood and men’s health (Rindfuss
1991; Shanahan 2000). FEGS models would still be biased if individual deviations from the
group-specific slopes were systematically related to the timing of fatherhood, for example, if
men who gain weight earlier are also more likely to become fathers earlier in their lives. To relax
the assumption, we estimate a third version of fixed effects models: fixed effects with individual-

14

specific slopes (FEIS) (Bruderl and Ludwig 2014; Wooldridge 2002:315–22), expressed as
follows:
𝑂𝑖𝑡 = 𝛿1 𝐹𝑖𝑡 + 𝛿2𝑖 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝛿3𝑖 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡2 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡′ 𝛽4 + 𝐴𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡

(3)

FEIS allows for trends in health outcomes to vary across men and measures the effect of
the treatment net of this individual-level variation pre- and post-transition to fatherhood.
Specifically, the terms 𝛿2𝑖 and 𝛿3𝑖 capture the varying health trajectories across individuals. The
FEIS model provides a strong test for the causal effect of fatherhood, but has barely been used in
family research. The main reason is that FEIS is very demanding in terms of data, as it requires
k+1 waves, where k is the number of individual slope parameters plus an individual-level
intercept. In this case, this amounts to three additional parameters, and thus a minimum of four
observations for each individual is needed. We therefore exclude individuals with fewer than 4
observations over time. As a robustness check, we restrict the sample to individuals with at least
four years of observation before men become fathers to aid in the estimation of a pre-treatment
trend, and obtain identical results (online supplementary material, Appendix Tables A).
The FEIS model provides a conservative test of the effect of fatherhood. In fact, by
modeling individual-level trajectories pre- and post-transition to fatherhood, the FEIS model can
absorb part of the effect of the treatment if the effect changes over time, inducing downward bias
in the parameter estimates (Meer and West 2016). We offer the FEIS model as the most stringent
test of an effect of fatherhood. Because FEIS may load the dice toward the null hypothesis, if we
find an effect of fatherhood using FEIS, it is exceedingly likely that a true causal effect exists.
All the outlined models –conventional FE, FEGS, and FEIS– capture discrete changes
men’s health after they become fathers. However, fatherhood could result in gradual health
effects over time as fathers adjust to their new role (Rindfuss 1991), or short-term health changes
15

followed by a return to prior levels (Myrskylä and Margolis 2014), for example if men quit
cigarettes only during the pregnancy and immediately after birth but then return to smoking.
Furthermore, changes in health behaviors or outcomes could start before the transition to
fatherhood, signaling reverse causality (for example, men who quit alcohol earlier may be more
likely to become fathers) or anticipation effects (for example, men may decide to “take care of
themselves” in preparation for fatherhood (Duncan et al. 2006). To examine changes over time in
the outcomes both prior to and after the transition to fatherhood, we estimate a time-distributed
fixed effects model (also known as event study), formulated as:
𝑂𝑖𝑡 = ∑𝑠𝑝=−𝑠 𝛽𝑝 𝐹𝑖𝑡𝑝 + 𝛽2 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝐴𝑔𝑒𝑖𝑡2 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡′ 𝛽4 + 𝐴𝑖 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡

(4)

The fatherhood dummy 𝐹𝑖𝑡 is replaced by a set of dummy variables 𝐹𝑖𝑡𝑝 where p is the number of
years since the transition to fatherhood if positive and the number of years to the transition to
fatherhood if negative, and the maximum horizon forward and backwards from the time of
becoming a father is s and -s respectively (Dougherty 2006). We use the following categorical
version of time from fatherhood: 7 or more years pre-fatherhood (baseline category), 5-6 years
pre-fatherhood, 3-4 years pre-fatherhood, 1-2 years pre-fatherhood, year in which men became
fathers, 1-2 years since fatherhood, 3-4 years since fatherhood, 5 or more years since fatherhood.
If no anticipation, reverse causality, and pre-fatherhood spurious trajectories exist, the first three
parameter estimates are expected to be statistically indistinguishable from zero. Similarly, if
fatherhood only has a transient effect, the magnitude of the estimates would decline over time.
The four kinds of fixed effects models we use vary in assumptions about how health
outcomes change with age and time since fatherhood. The conventional fixed effects model (FE)
assumes that after time-invariant characteristics of men are considered, any difference in health
outcomes between fathers and non-fathers is attributable to paternity. The FEGS model allows
16

different age-based health trajectories for ever- and never-fathers, accounting for unobserved
selectivity in trajectories of men who become fathers. The FEIS model is even more
conservative: instead of allowing age trajectories to vary only by fatherhood status, it allows
variation in age trajectories of all individuals in the sample. Finally, the TDFE examines changes
in health prior to becoming a father, and tests whether the effect of fatherhood is temporary or
permanent. By comparing results from four models we are able to evaluate the stability,
robustness, and timing of the effect of fatherhood, ruling out diverse sources of confounding.

RESULTS: DOES FATHERHOOD HAVE AN EFFECT ON MEN’S HEALTH?
We begin by examining the effect of fatherhood on each of the five risk factors – body
weight, alcohol, smoking, marijuana, and hard drugs – and self-rated health using our four fixed
effects specifications. We next discuss potential sources of heterogeneity.
Body Weight: Figure 1 shows the estimated effects of fatherhood on weight (complete set of
parameter estimates are available in online supplementary material, Appendix Table B1). A
conventional fixed effects model shows a significant increase in men’s body weight by about 1.5
pounds on average after they became fathers. The TDFE model indicates that there was no
change in body weight prior to becoming a father, ruling out reverse causality or spurious
trajectories – for example, if men who were already gaining weight were more likely to become
fathers. The model also suggests that weight gain increased over time after the transition to
fatherhood, although the trend is not statistically significant (and the parameter estimate
associated with 1-2 years after fatherhood fails to reach significance at the conventional p<.05
level). Overall, this model indicates that men experienced a discrete increase in weight after
becoming fathers that persisted over the years that followed this transition.
17

Models adding group-specific slopes (FEGS) and individual-level slopes (FEIS) show a
consistent, albeit somewhat smaller, effect of becoming a father on body weight: an increase in
weight by about 1 to 1.3 pounds. This effect is significantly different from zero and
indistinguishable from the effect captured with a conventional fixed effects model. Given the
stringent assumption of the FEGS and, particularly the FEIS model, we interpret these results as
strong evidence that becoming a father induces weight gain in men.
Prior research uses the height-adjusted body mass index (BMI) to examine the effect of
fatherhood on weight. While we prefer using unadjusted weight because of measurement error in
self-reported height, our analysis with BMI yields similar results (online appendix Table C1).
The magnitude of change in terms of BMI ranges from 0.11 to 0.17 kg/m2, which is smaller
compared to estimates of prior studies (Garfield et al. 2016; Syrda 2017; Umberson et al. 2011).
This could suggest that paternity had a smaller impact on the weight of fathers among Millennial
men compared to prior cohorts. Nevertheless, the magnitude of the effect observed in this study
is nontrivial, being comparable to the weight gain after one year among smokers who quit
cigarettes (Aubin et al. 2012).
[Figure 1 about here]
Alcohol Consumption. Figure 2 and Table B2 in the online supplement show findings about the
effect of fatherhood on alcohol use. The transition to fatherhood increased the probability of
abstinence/light alcohol use (having less than 9 drinks in the last 30 days) compared to heavier
drinking. On average, becoming a father increased the probability of abstinence/ light drinking
by 3 percentage points. As a benchmark, in 2015, 73 percent of men in the sample were light
drinkers, while the remainder were moderate to heavy drinkers. This effect would mean a
substantial decline in the proportion of moderate and heavy drinkers from 27 to 24 percent.

18

The TDFE model shows, again, that alcohol use declined after, but not prior to, the
transition to fatherhood. This decline persisted over time from the year in which the child was
born up to 5 or more years after men became fathers, suggesting a long-term change in lifestyle.
Furthermore, the TDFE model shows that the drop in alcohol use did not start before the
transition to fatherhood, suggesting that it was the actual transition, rather than unobserved
trajectories or anticipation, which drove this effect. The FEGS and FEIS models show effects of
similar magnitude to the standard FE model, providing strong evidence that fatherhood indeed
reduced alcohol consumption.
[Figure 2 about here]
Cigarette Smoking. Figure 3 examines the effect of becoming a father on cigarette smoking (full
results available in online appendix, Table B3). It shows that the transition to fatherhood had no
impact on smoking. Although the parameter estimates capturing this effect have the expected
direction in all models –showing that becoming a father reduced smoking– the effects fail to
reach significance, except in the FEIS model. An insignificant effect of fatherhood on smoking is
consistent with prior research (Bachman et al. 1997) and suggests the difficulty of quitting
smoking (Hughes, Keely, and Naud 2004).
[Figure 3 about here]
Marijuana. Figure 4 (online supplement, Table B4) examines the effect of becoming a father on
marijuana use. The transition to fatherhood resulted in a drop in the probability of using
marijuana in the last 30 days by approximately 3 percentage points. However, the TDFE model
questions an effect of fatherhood, finding that use of marijuana began to decline several years
prior to the transition to fatherhood, and declined more strongly after men became fathers.
According to the TDFE, even 6 years prior to fatherhood a significant decline of marijuana
19

consumption by about 2 percentage points is observed. This change is too early in the life course
to be attributed to anticipation of fatherhood, and suggests that men who eventually became
fathers reduced their consumption of marijuana earlier in their lives for reasons other than the
transition to fatherhood, suggesting the possibility of reverse causality or a spurious trajectory.
The FEGS and FEIS models, intended to alleviate bias emerging from unobserved
trajectories of men who eventually become fathers, show that the reduction in marijuana use fails
to reach significance. This evidence adds to the finding of an early decline in marijuana
consumption before men became fathers obtained from the TDFE estimates, leading us to
conclude that becoming a father did not significantly reduce the use of marijuana. In this case,
using a conventional fixed effects model would have led to an inaccurate conclusion.
[Figure 4 about here]
“Hard” drug use. Figure 5 considers the effect of fatherhood on quitting “hard” drugs such as
cocaine and heroin (full results provided in online supplement, Table B5). All models show
declines of about half a percentage point, which are large considering that only 4.4 percent of
men used these drugs in 2015. However, these estimates are not significantly different from zero.
Based on the analysis, we conclude that, as in the case of smoking and marijuana, fatherhood did
not affect consumption of “hard” drugs (or that our sample size does not allow us to capture an
effect given the tall data requirements of fixed effects models).
[Figure 5 about here]
Self-rated health. Finally, we examine the effect of becoming a father on self-reported health,
which provides an overall subjective assessment of wellbeing with an exceptional ability to
predict later mortality and morbidity (Benjamins et al. 2004; Schnittker and Bacak 2014). The

20

findings, reported in Figure 6 and online appendix Table B6, show that the transition to
fatherhood resulted in a decline by .06 points in a 1-5 self-rated health scale, a small but
significant drop. The TDFE model shows that this decline started only the year after men became
fathers, with no effect prior to the transition to fatherhood. This effect persisted over at least five
years after the transition to fatherhood, again suggesting a long-term change in health status
associated with becoming a father. The FEGS model shows similarly negative effects as the
conventional fixed effects specification. However, the FEIS model allowing for individualspecific slopes shows a smaller negative influence of fatherhood that fails to reach significance at
the .05 level. Given the stringent assumptions of the FEIS model and the consistent negative
estimates from other models, we conclude that the transition to fatherhood resulted in a decline
in men’s self-reported health. Ancillary analysis (online Appendix C2) shows that this effect was
driven by a decline in men reporting excellent health after becoming fathers rather than by an
increase in poor health. Alternative models using an ordinal logit formulation yield similar
results.
[Figure 6 about here]
Are the effects of the transition to fatherhood heterogeneous across men? Our findings
indicate that becoming a father induced weight gain, reduced alcohol consumption, and lowered
self-rated health in early adulthood. These average effects pertained to all early-Millennial men.
The literature however suggests that the effects may vary by economic and psychosocial
resources as well as differences in the experience, salience, and constraints associated with
fatherhood. We examine heterogeneity in effects by men’s educational level, race and ethnicity,
age of transition to fatherhood, partnership status, and co-residential status. We suggest that the
results of this heterogeneity analysis be interpreted with caution: Given sample size constraints

21

in context of fixed effects models and variation in sample size across groups, we may fail to
capture differences across groups. We therefore interpret the substantive magnitude of
differences, and not just their statistical significance, as suggestive evidence.
Figure 7 offers the result of our analysis allowing variation in effects across these
dimensions for the outcomes where a consistent effect was found – body weight, alcohol
consumption, and self-rated health (no significant variation was found for other outcomes, full
results are presented in the online supplement, Appendix D). Overall, the figure shows limited
differences in the consequences of fatherhood across different types of men. However, some
suggestive patterns emerge, which we discuss below.
The analysis of heterogeneity by race and education suggests that while all men are
impacted by fatherhood, the mechanisms driving effects across sub-groups might vary. For
example, when it comes to race and ethnicity, fatherhood increased the risk of weight gain for
Hispanics more than other groups, and lowered alcohol use among Whites compared to other
groups. When stratified by education, it appears that less educated men were more negatively
impacted by fatherhood in terms of weight. In ancillary analyses, we further stratified the
samples to observe differences across groups by race and education. These analyses find that
among Black and Hispanic men, those with higher levels of education gained more weight
compared to those with less education, but that this pattern was reversed for White men (online
appendix Table E1). For alcohol use, we find a stronger effect among less educated Black and
Hispanic fathers (online appendix Table E2), which is consistent with prior research suggesting
that fatherhood could be particularly transformative for at-risk men (Kerr et al. 2011; Sampson
and Laub 1990). The effect on self-rated health was similar across all racial groups (Figure 7,
panel c) and as well as sub-groups defined by race-education interactions (online appendix Table

22

E3). Overall, our analysis of race and education suggests that the specific risk factors impacted
by fatherhood varied across different population strata. Nevertheless, the net effect – as captured
by self-reported health – was comparable across groups.
Stratification of the sample by other characteristics largely suggests the absence of a
systematic pattern. For example, young fathers gained the most weight after transitioning to
parenthood, while those who transitioned between ages 22-27 experienced the strongest effect on
alcohol use. Relatively older fathers did not experience a significant change in either weight or
alcohol use. Marital status at the time of parenthood transition had no bearing on subsequent
weight, but lowered alcohol use among unmarried men. Finally, as observed in the analysis of
race and education, self-rated health consistently declined across all sub-groups.
Co-residence –typically an indicator of greater involvement with the child – was not a
substantial source of variation. This is aligned with a number of prior studies, which have also
noted similarity in health outcomes by paternal co-residence (Eggebeen and Knoester 2001;
Garfield et al. 2016; Knoester and Eggebeen 2006; Knoester et al. 2007). It is important to recall,
however, that 50 percent of fathers who were non-resident when they transitioned into
parenthood eventually became resident parents. This means that while those in the non-resident
group were indeed less likely to be residential parents compared to fathers classified as resident,
non-residence was not a perfect indicator for continued lack of quotidian involvement with
children.
[Figure 7 about here]

CONCLUSIONS

23

Becoming a father had both beneficial and detrimental consequences for health among a
recent cohort of men who became fathers in the early 21st century. The transition to fatherhood
induced weight gain and lowered self-reported health. At the same time, becoming a father
reduced the consumption of alcohol. These effects are persistent over early adulthood, suggesting
that becoming a father involves lifestyle transformations over the initial years after the birth.
Given the large number of men who become fathers over their life course –over 80 percent in the
US in 2015 (Martinez, Daniels, and Febo-Vazquez 2018)– these effects have wide demographic
implications.
We also investigated heterogeneity in the consequences of fatherhood across a number of
dimensions suggested by prior literature. Although our ability to capture heterogeneity is
hampered by sample size constraints, we found limited variation in magnitude of the effects
across sub-groups defined by race and ethnicity, age of first birth, and marital status at first birth,
which suggests that the specific risk factors impacted by fatherhood vary across contexts.
Interestingly, self-reported health declined by relatively similar magnitude across all sub-groups,
suggesting that becoming a father affects the health of a vast swath of American men, in spite of
different positions and constraints. More detailed, especially qualitative work, will be able to
shed further light on variation across specific circumstances and experiences of fatherhood.
Our research contributes to the body of literature examining the association between
family bonds and health and wellbeing (Mirowsky 2002; Ross et al. 1990; Umberson 1987;
Umberson and Montez 2010). Specifically, we build on a recent scholarship attempting to
capture a causal effect of fatherhood on men’s health (Garfield et al. 2016; Kerr et al. 2011;
Myrskylä and Margolis 2014; Nomaguchi and Milkie 2003; Pudrovska 2008; Wolfe 2009).
Using novel fixed effects specifications, we account for selection based on both unobserved

24

characteristics and unobserved life-course trajectories of men who eventually become fathers, as
well as for the possibility of reverse causality and transient effects. The combination of fixed
effects formulations provides transparent and robust evidence of the consequences of fatherhood.
Still, without random allocation of fatherhood status, it is impossible to conclusively claim that
the associations we uncover are causal. Having examined a range of health indicators, we can
comment on social processes potentially shaping the health effects of fatherhood. Consistent
with the predictions of stress theory (Aneshensel 1992; Thoits 2010), we find that fatherhood
results in weight gain. While identity motivations would lead men to take care of their bodies as
a means of fulfilling their role-based responsibilities (Watson 2000), our findings suggest that
any protective effect of father identity on weight might be superseded by constraints emerging
from the novel burden of parenthood and associated stress, particularly for socioeconomically
disadvantaged men. When it comes to alcohol use, the findings are consistent with both identitybased and social regulation mechanisms, as reduction in alcohol use may reflect a desire to
maintain health as well as internalization of the norms associated with use of addictive
substances (Umberson 1987). Finally, fatherhood worsens self-rated health, which is also
consistent with stress as a plausible mechanism.
The NLSY97 dataset used for this analysis is probably the best source of longitudinal
information of life trajectories among a cohort that came of age in the early 21 st century. It is,
however, not free of limitations. First, it is not possible with the data at hand to directly measure
the mechanisms driving the health effects of fatherhood. Rather, we can only evaluate theorized
mechanisms based on their consistency with our empirical findings. Second, relatively small
sample sizes for some demographic sub-groups and the data demands of fixed effects models
limit our ability to find significant sources of variation that have been suggested by qualitative

25

research (Abdill 2018; Bottorff et al. 2009; Reczek et al. 2014; Watson 2000). Furthermore,
sample members are only 30-36 years old in the last wave of observation. This means that some
of them would become fathers in the future, inducing right censoring. This problem appears to be
minor, however: our analysis indicates that a very small proportion of men in the cohort we
examined become fathers for the first time after their mid-30s (online appendix F). The youth of
our sample also means that we cannot observe the effect of fatherhood as men transition into late
adulthood and their children transition into adolescence (Meier et al. 2018). Although we find
persistent consequences during early adulthood, only further research examining individuals as
they age can investigate these effects over the remainder of the life course.
Our findings have, however, relevant implications for understanding the role of
parenthood bonds and expectations on important sources of men’s health and mortality,
including “metabolic deaths”, resulting from obesity-related diseases (Masters, Powers, and Link
2013; Preston, Vierboom, and Stokes 2018), and mortality due to diseases of the liver, largely
attributable to alcohol abuse (Tapper and Parikh 2018). In particular, we highlight the protective
role of fatherhood, likely explained by mechanisms of social regulation and social identity, in
preventing alcohol-related morbidity, as well as the constraints and stress that potentially
contribute to weight gain and deterioration in self-rated health, respectively. However,
importantly, our estimates for weight gain are smaller compared to studies based on samples of
earlier birth cohorts (Garfield et al. 2016; Syrda 2017; Umberson et al. 2011). This suggests that
the effects of fatherhood on weight – while statistically significant – are not as large for early
Millennial men.
Finally, while the majority of American men do become fathers, US fertility rates have
been declining for nearly a decade, a trend that is expected to continue in the future (Munnell,

26

Chen, and Sanzenbacher 2018; Seltzer 2019). Our findings are also relevant for the long-run
implications of increasing rates of childlessness for men’s health. In particular, childlessness may
decrease weight-related morbidity, but with the absence of social control and identity
mechanisms accompanying parenthood, childless men could be at greater risk of alcohol and
substance use. Given the recent rise in male mid-life mortality in the United States (Acciai and
Firebaugh 2017; Woolf et al. 2018), we hope that these findings will enhance our collective
capability to address health risks among men approaching midlife, both fathers and non-fathers.
