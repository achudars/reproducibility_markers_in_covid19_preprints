Abstract
Teacher education programmes (TEPs) promote unique experiences that involve a
deep understanding of teaching needs, advanced strategies, preparation and training at universities
or schools. The main objective of this study is to investigate the English teacher education
programme (ETEP) in order to reform and develop current teaching practices in a rapidly
developing area of research. The present study aims to look at three main areas which include the
university preparation strategy, classroom teaching and supervisory support of an ETEP in Yemen.
The data were collected through a questionnaire emailed to all the fourth-year student teachers of
the English Department, Faculty of Education, at a public university in Yemen. The results reveal
several issues concerning university courses, pedagogical practices, planning
lessons, methodologies, and approaches. They disclose some inconsistencies between the
proposed strategies at the university and the actual classroom implementation. The results also
indicate that the present teaching duration is insufficient to realize the real benefits of
the program for sustainable growth. The study provides some recommendations for student
teachers, teachers, supervisors, curriculum designers, and policymakers.

An EFL Teacher Education Programme: Issues and Concerns

Al-Jaro & Asmawi

Introduction
Teacher education programmes (TEPs) are developed to equip student teachers with the necessary
pedagogical skills and competencies to cope with issues they might encounter during their teaching
practice experience (Cheng, Cheng, & Tang, 2010). Identifying these issues and concerns could
lead to better preparation and training (Goh & Matthews, 2011; Mukeredzi & Mandrona, 2013)
and eventually result in a successful teaching practice experience (Lawson, Çakmak, Gündüz, &
Busher, 2015). That experience, or as it is sometimes called teaching practicum (Hyland and Lo,
2006; Farrell, 2008; Moody, 2009; Kabilan, 2013; Canh, 2014; Merç, 2015), is considered as the
first step where student teachers can gain practical classroom experience and be trained to apply
and implement theory and teaching ideas professionally (Gebhard, 2009) through the guidance of
experienced supervisors.
One of the main goals TEPs is bridging the gap between theory and practice (Cheng et al.,
2010; Endeley, 2014) where successful implementation of theory and teaching skills needs
experienced teacher trainers to reflect the full benefits of the programme. Another aim is concerned
with the quality of the student teacher’s learning experience (Cabaroglu, 2014) which might be
influenced by their prior training at the educational institution, teaching context, and the teacher
education programme (Cheng et al., 2010). Additionally, the expert supervisors, who act as models
for their supervisees have a great role in reshaping the professional identity of the student teachers.
They can guide and provide them with usefully practical strategies for classroom management
(Yazdanmehr & Akbari, 2015).
Literature review
A review of pertinent literature on the student teachers’ teaching practice indicates that there are
various issues facing the student teachers during practicum at schools among which are: classroom
implementation, instructional proficiency, unexpected supervision, insufficient preparation, and
fear of evaluation (Kyriacou & Stephens,1999; Harwell & Moore, 2010; Azeem, 2011; Goh &
Matthews, 2011). For instance, Kyriacou and Stephens (1999) identify some obstacles facing
student teachers during practicum such as dealing with disruptive behaviour, inability to teach
professionally, lack of planning skills, and insufficient preparatory teaching practice. Whereas in
a different context, Harwell and Moore (2010) identify other issues with respect to the teaching
practicum experience in the United States. Student teachers are concerned about their performance
in the teaching practice, their interaction with supervisors, successful implementation, and the
general benefit of the experience. Another actual concern which might affect the student teachers’
teaching practice is insufficient preparation. This is highlighted in Azeem’s (2011) study on the
problems facing student teachers during teaching practice in Pakistan. Azeem reports that most
student teachers are not trained to use different methods of teaching before they started teaching
at schools. Likewise, Goh and Matthews (2011) identify four issues of teaching practicum in a
Malaysian context. These are classroom management and student discipline, institutional and

personal adjustment, classroom teaching, and student learning. They stress the need to provide
student teachers with techniques as well as strategies to overcome these issues. Additionally,
Mukeredzi and Mandrona (2013) investigate the student teachers' teaching practice in a rural South
African context by identifying the negative and positive experiences, and the different factors
behind such experiences. They report a lack of staff and school administration support and
guidance for the student teachers, and the only support they received is through the collaborative
interaction with learners and peers.
In the field of English as a second/foreign language (ESL/EFL), similar studies have been
conducted to investigate issues, concerns, dilemmas and challenges encountered by student
teachers during teaching practice. For example, Ali, Othman, and Karim (2014) address issues and
concerns of twenty student teachers from a private university in Malaysia. They conclude that
instructional practices, management, students' discipline, facilities and support, interaction with
cooperating teachers and university supervisors affected the efficacy of the teaching practice
experience. They also recommend these concerns to be acknowledged by the competent people,
concerned stakeholders, and institutions for further development. In a like manner, Cabaroglu
(2014) focuses on the dilemma that student teachers faced during their teaching practice. They
necessitate a need for support to assist student teachers to deal with a variety of dilemmas which
might lead to worse issues such as conflicts, frustration, tension, physical and emotional stress.
Cabaroglu reveals that the mismatch between theory and practice is another problem which should
be solved by context-specific solutions.
In summary, most of the student teachers’ concerns are either relevant to the theorypractice disconnect, supervision, and evaluation, or initial preparation of TEPs. Teaching practice
experience is an opportunity for student teachers to translate the educational theories they learned
during preparation into actual classroom practices. Likewise, supervision is an essential element
which assists student teachers in translating what they have learned in their theoretical views and
methods into practice to improve their professional performance (Farrell, 2007). Furthermore,
initial preparation plays a key role in shaping student teachers’ teaching profile. Thus, great efforts
should be exerted into improving teachers’ proficiency as well as teaching performance to obtain
the necessary changes on TEPs (Darling-Hammond & Baratz-Snowden, 2007) and contribute
significantly to teacher quality in general (Endeley, 2014).
Background of the study
English language teaching in Yemen, the study context, is quite uncertain and requires extensive
and continuous investigation. English is considered a foreign language in Yemen (Al-Ahdal, 2010;
Al-Ezzi, 2012) where the Arabic language is the official language used as a medium of instruction
at all levels. In schools, the English language is taught as a subject of the school curriculum that
starts from the seventh grade in the primary education to the third grade in the secondary education

with an average of five classes a week (nearly 40 minutes per each class period). At the tertiary
level, the English language is taught as a requirement in non-English departments (Bhooth, 2015).
In the last three decades, Yemen witnessed a rapid growth in the enrolment of school
teachers into educational training institutions. Therefore, the government has given great attention
to the TEPs in general and ETEP, in particular, to prepare and train teachers in different teacher
education institutions in Yemen and meet the current development in various fields. These
programmes are now offered by the Faculties of Education which are administered by the Ministry
of Higher Education and Scientific Research (Muthanna & Karaman, 2011).
Almost hundreds of Yemeni EFL student teachers annually graduate from Faculties of
Education to be teachers at primary and secondary schools. However, studies reported that inservice teachers lack the competence in the use of teaching methods and techniques (Zuheer, 2013)
and experience theory-practice challenges during their classroom practices (Al-Musalami, 2011;
Bataineh, Bataineh, & Thabet, 2011). Although these studies admitted the teachers’ teaching
weaknesses and recommended improvement in the teaching strategies, there is a lack of studies to
investigate the initial preparation of those teachers and issues they might face during practicum at
schools. Teaching practicum is a very important component in any teacher education programme
(Farrell, 2007; Farrell, 2008; Canh, 2014) and is a substantial stage in reconstructing the teaching
identity of student teachers (Gebhard, 2009). As a crucial part of TEPs, it is the student teachers’
opportunity to gain practical experience and implement theory through the guidance of
experienced supervisors. In addition, it offers an opportunity to develop student teachers’
capabilities as well as teaching strategies and bridge the gap between theory and practice (Endeley,
2014). İt is, therefore, crucial to investigate the issues and concerns of ETEP in Yemen.
Setting
English teacher education programme in Yemen aims to professionally prepare students to be
teachers of English language at primary and secondary schools. It offers 49 courses related to
teaching methods, language skills, English literature, Yemeni education and culture, and other
relevant aspects taught in four years, eight semesters. Students must pass them to graduate with a
bachelor’s degree in education. In the first semester of the fourth year, the students must join
nearby schools to start practising teaching the English language for one complete semester. They
will be given an opportunity to teach in a real classroom under the guidance and supervision of
four supervisors; two university supervisors, the cooperative teacher and the school headmaster
who assist and assess these students’ teaching performance. The student teachers can select the
host primary or secondary public schools. Most of them usually select the nearest schools to their
residences. Based on their preference, the practicum programme office will arrange with the
Ministry of Education General Office to officially issue letters to the host schools to welcome the

student teachers and arrange their teaching schedule since they teach only three days a week.
However, they must attend some classes at the university in the remaining two days of the week.
The Rationale of the Study
The rationale of this study is to address the issues facing the EFL student teachers during their
teaching practice in a relatively under-researched setting. Understanding these issues and concerns
specifically in the three main areas, i.e. university preparation, classroom implementation, and
supervisory support could fill the gap in a locally situated research and provide rich data necessary
for continuous improvement of ETEP. It could also provide insights into similar educational
contexts, useful suggestions and valuable information for educators, programme directors, and
decision makers. To achieve this aim, the study is guided by the following three questions:
1. What are the issues facing the EFL student teachers in terms of university preparation?
2. What are the issues encountered by the EFL student teachers in respect of the classroom
implementation?
3. What are the issues faced by the EFL student teachers in respect of the supervisory support?
Methodology
Population and Sampling
The target population of the study was 62 fourth-year student teachers who were enrolled in the
ETEP offered by the Department of English, Faculty of Education, at a public university in Yemen.
They were 47 males and 15 females who completed their teaching practice experience at schools.
They share the same cultural background, and their first language is Arabic. All the student
teachers were emailed the data collection instrument because the entire finite population of the
study is small (Creswell, 2005). They were provided with necessary instructions to complete the
survey questionnaire and briefed on the study objectives. They were also informed that their
participation is voluntary, and all information gathered will not be disclosed but only to be used
for the study purposes. Additionally, they were ensured that their real names will not be revealed
in the study findings. Therefore, confidentiality and anonymity were maintained. Forty-eight
student teachers (35 males and 13 females) responded and returned back the questionnaires via
email. Therefore, only those respondents constitute the study sample and they are 77.4% of the
study population.
Data Collection
In the present study, the data were collected through a survey questionnaire emailed to all the
fourth-year student teachers of the English Department, Faculty of Education, at a public university
in Yemen after they had completed twelve weeks teaching practice at various schools. The survey
questionnaire includes two sections. Section A is adapted from two surveys used by Harwell and
Moore (2010) and Ali et al. (2014). It contains thirty items related to three main areas: (i) university
preparation (7 items); (ii) classroom implementation (9 items); and (iii) supervisory support (14
items). The respondents are required to select the answer which best represents their view based

on a five-point Likert scale: ‘1’ strongly disagree (SD), ‘2’ disagree (D), ‘3’ undecided (UD), ‘4’
agree (A), and ‘5’ strongly agree (SA). Section B has an open-ended question on issues and
concerns which are not included in section A.
To maximize the validity of the study instrument, five experts from two English language
teacher education training institutions were consulted about the instrument. They gave some
suggestions on the instrument which were taken into consideration. The final draft of the survey
questionnaire was then subjected to a “pilot test” (Creswell, 2005, p. 367). İt was distributed to a
group of 15 student teachers who had graduated from the same department. They were asked to
respond to the survey questionnaire and comment on the clarity of the instrument instructions and
the difficulty of questions if any. The purpose of this pilot test was mainly to identify and avoid
the practical ambiguities that might face the target respondents. Thus, they will be able to complete
the survey questionnaire without much difficulty. Based on the pilot group feedback, the
instrument was modified. After ensuring that the instructions and all questions of the instrument
were clear and unambiguous, it was emailed to the study participants.
It is worth noting here that the questionnaire was emailed as it is “a convenient way to reach
a geographically dispersed sample of a population” (Creswell, 2005, p. 361). However, one
limitation of this questionnaire in this study was that some questionnaires were not returned
probably due to invalid e-mail addresses or lack of internet access, and only forty-eight completed
questionnaires were emailed back to the researchers. Therefore, the response return rate was
77.4% which is considered relatively high to “create a stronger claim in generalizing results from
the sample to the population” (Creswell, 2005, p. 367).
Data analysis
The data collected from the forty-eight student teachers who had responded were included in the
final analysis. As the survey questionnaire comprised of two sections, the participants' responses
to the first section (A) were statistically analysed using descriptive statistics via SPSS 20 software.
The mean and standard deviation were computed for each statement. For the purpose of statistical
analysis, each of the variables in the five-point Likert scale was coded as follows: AD ‘1’, D ‘2’,
UD ‘3’, A ‘4’, and SA ‘5’. All the questionnaire statements were positive attributions and graded
as 1-2-3-4-5. Therefore, according to Birisci, Metin and Karakas (2009) and Abedalaziz,
Jamaluddin, and Leng (2013), the ranges of agreement in the questionnaire will be determined
through the use of the formula (n-1)/n after calculating the interval width of the range between 1
through 5 as 0.8. Table 1 below shows the range of statements in the questionnaire:

As shown in Table 1, the interval width 1-1.80 indicates a very low level, 1.81-2.60
indicates a low level, 2.61-3.40 indicates a medium level, 3.41- 4.20 indicates a high level and
4.21-5.00 indicates a very high level of agreement with the items in the questionnaire. Therefore,
items that score a mean of 3.41 and above are considered positive while the ones that score 2.60
and below are considered negative.
However, Section (B) of the instrument was analyzed qualitatively by reading the student
teachers’ written responses many times and analyzing them to generate codes. Then similar codes
were classified under one family or category. The results were three broad themes emerging from
this analysis which represented the issues and concerns other than those mentioned in section (A).
Results
Analysis of the EFL student teachers survey questionnaire reveals several issues and concerns
related to university preparation, classroom implementation and the supervisory support faced by
them during their teaching practice. Some other emerging issues were also developed from the
open-ended question. The data analysis discloses the following results. They are presented
according to the study questions:

main concerns and issues. They expressed insufficient input that would have enabled them to plan
their lessons well, teach skill focused content knowledge, and utilize different teaching methods.
That is also supported by their responses on microteaching which, to them, does not really satisfy
their need to develop their teaching skills and get more in-depth knowledge regarding the art of
teaching. Consequently, the participants felt not well prepared to hold a teaching position after
their teaching practice experience.

Table 3 illustrates the mean scores of the items 8-16 that identifies issues and concerns
related to the student teachers’ classroom implementation. Four items (8, 11, 13, and 14) scored
very high, while five items (9, 10, 12, 15, and 16) scored very low. Student teachers were unable
to handle their classes effectively, to give clear guidance for planning to teach (items 9 and 10)
and to implement what they had learnt while teaching (item 12). Besides, they were not asked to
complete evaluation forms or to keep notes and diaries about their teaching practice experience
(items 15 and 16). The global mean of all items 3.0116 indicates that the overall level of the student
teacher' classroom performance is medium which implies the need for exposing them to the
necessary strategies for planning lessons and managing the classroom. Besides, they should be
encouraged to reflect on their teaching practice as it is helpful to recall the gained knowledge,

teaching practice. Only three items (21, 22, 27) scored a high mean, three items (17, 23, 26) scored
a medium means, while eight items (18, 19, 20, 24, 25, 28, 29, 30) scored a low mean. Student
teachers were not provided with enough guidance before teaching and did not receive effective
criticism after teaching from their cooperating and university supervisors (items 2, 3, 4, 8, 9). In
addition, they were not satisfied with the supervisory observations (item 28, 29), and the number
of observations was not enough to support them during their teaching practice (item 30). The global
mean came up to 2.5670 which is negative, indicating that interaction with supervisors during
teaching practice is not enough, and the support received is limited. A closer look at the results
shows that the university supervisors offered helpful advice and better suggestions (items 21, 22)
compared to the school headmaster (item 26). Thus, some student teachers felt uncomfortable
discussing problems encountered with the school headmaster (item 27).
Other issues and concerns
The student teachers reported several issues and concerns they faced during their teaching practice
experience in their responses to Section B of the questionnaire. Figure 1 shows the reported issues
and concerns that were not captured in section A. Three broad themes were identified with
classroom challenges as their major issue of concern followed by pedagogically related problems
and limited supervisory support. Other issues were also mentioned by student teachers; however,
they were already highlighted and discussed in section A. Therefore, they are termed as “Others”
in Figure 1.

Classroom Challenges
Most of the student teachers expressed their enthusiastic feelings at the beginning of their teaching
practice to have this shift in their educational lives. However, they encountered some challenges
during their teaching practice which included the conflicts between their ideal vision of language
teaching and learning, and the reality of school life. In fact, they experienced a "reality shock"
(Farrell, 2003) when they tended to implement what they had studied at the university. For

instance, student teacher A described her excitement to be a teacher at the beginning of practice,
but she was later disappointed with the school system. She added:
I found a completely different situation. The school administration did not allow
me to practice different classroom activities and innovative ideas to encourage
my students to participate which made me hate the school system.
Another important issue was reported by student teacher B. She was frustrated by the big gap
between the theoretical part and the real classroom practice. She wrote:
Then during my teaching practice, I was shocked because of the big gap
between what I have studied and the classroom real teaching. It was a big
challenge I have experienced, so I was really frustrated.
Additionally, some student teachers faced other challenges that hindered their teaching
performance such as a large number of classes, low proficiency in English and students’ negative
attitude towards studying the English language which complicated their teaching task. For
instance, a student teacher C mentioned some of the difficulties he faced during his teaching
practice. He wrote:
As I started my teaching practice, I faced some difficulties in presenting the
lesson and dealing with pupils. There were many pupils in the class, and most
of them had a negative attitude towards studying the English Language. They
usually told me that they hate English subject.
Another student teacher D reported that students had a difficulty to understand her when she spoke
in English. She added:
One problem I faced while teaching practice was the students’ low proficiency
in English. I usually use the English language in the classroom, but my students
did not understand me. And they were usually asking for translation in their
first language (Arabic) which was time-consuming.
Pedagogical Practices
Around 23% of the student teachers raised some issues and concerns related to their
pedagogical practices; such as planning lessons, classroom management, school facilities, and
practicum duration. For example, the student teacher D indicated that she could not plan her lesson
well and cover what had been planned during the class period. She claimed: “I could not control
the time of the class period because I wanted to explain all my lesson parts for only 35 minutes
which were not enough to cover everything”
A similar issue was reported by the student teacher, C. He said, “I could not organize
myself well. When I prepared my lessons, I did not know how to follow the plan to transfer the
information and ideas to the pupils. I do not know, maybe I need more training”. Likewise, student
teachers faced difficulty in managing their classes. For instance, a student teacher, E admitted:

An EFL Teacher Education Programme: Issues and Concerns

Al-Jaro & Asmawi

Teaching is not an easy task as people think. For me, it was very difficult. I
could not control the class because I had more than 40 students who usually
were making noises during my classes.
Another student teacher, F also indicated that the late classes affected her teaching class and it was
a cause of noising among learners. She justified that by:
Because all my teaching classes were scheduled at the end, and the students at
that time were tired, hungry, and absent-minded. Therefore, most of them made
noises by moving their feet and chairs on the floor as a sign to dismiss the class
Besides, some student teachers were concerned about school facilities. They claimed that the host
schools did not provide them with necessary visual aids for presenting their lessons well. One
student teacher, G voiced:
There is a shortage of visual aids in the school. There is no English language
laboratory to teach students English sounds and listening skills. I used only the
cassette recorder or MP4 recorded to let the student listen to the native or
native-like speakers
In addition, some student teachers expressed that the teaching practicum duration was relatively
short because some schools ended the term earlier that year due to the political turmoil in the
country. Thus, they could not follow their plans. For example, the student teacher H wrote: “The
practicum period was not quite enough (only 8 weeks), and I could not cover all the syllabus that
I am supposed to complete. Some lessons were left (untaught)”.
Limited supervisory support and feedback
Although the student teachers were supervised by a panel of four supervisors, they expressed some
issues regarding the received support and feedback from their supervisors. Overall, they claimed
that they did not receive sufficient support and feedback from their supervisors and the number of
observations was inadequate. One student teacher wrote about this problem: “My cooperative
teacher observed my teaching class only once because he had a heavy teaching schedule (20 classes
per week). Therefore, he could not observe my teaching performance many times” (A reported).
Another student teacher, J expressed her disagreement with the assigned cooperating
supervisor. She explained:
There are three teachers of English at the school I practised in, but the school
administration assigned the inexpert one to be my cooperative teacher. I wished
I could change him. He did not provide me with useful guidance on my lesson
planning and teaching.
The student teacher, C also indicated that he could not communicate and receive feedback from
his cooperating teacher as he was always busy with teaching classes. It seemed that the supervisory
support was inconsistent and inadequate as the teaching practice was carried out concurrently with
cooperating teachers’ teaching classes at schools and with university supervisors’ lectures at the
faculty. Thus, the expected support and feedback on the student teachers’ teaching practice were
limited and affected their performance.

An EFL Teacher Education Programme: Issues and Concerns

Al-Jaro & Asmawi

Discussion
The purpose of this study is to investigate the issues and concerns encountered by EFL student
teachers during their teaching practice in terms of university preparation, classroom
implementation, and supervisory support. Results show that the student teachers were discontented
with several issues related to practicum preparation and supervision which consequently
influenced their real classroom implementation and reduced the effectiveness of the ETEP.
The student teachers in this study indicated that they did not receive enough input to enable
them to plan their lessons well and articulate what they planned to teach through implementing
different teaching methods. Thus, they practised a theory-practice gap which limited their teaching
performance. Similarly, in line with the findings of Ali et al. (2014), the student teachers admitted
the lack of university courses as they faced issues with lesson planning. They were also confused
to plan different class activities to engage their students in the learning process. This is consistent
with the findings set forth by Canh (2014) that the EFL teacher education programme did not
provide student teachers with basic teaching skills to experience a useful and professional teaching
practice.
Overall, most of the study participants expressed that the teaching practice developed their
teaching strategies and skills; however, some encountered difficulty in implementing what they
learned during the teaching practice. The first part of this result is in congruence with the findings
of Harwell and Moore's (2010) study that the practicum experience helps the student teachers
become more prepared to deal with classroom teaching. Whereas, the second part comes in line
with Cabaroglu's (2014) work which revealed that the student teachers experienced a problem to
implement what they had studied during their practice at the traditional school setting. However,
the result is inconsistent with the findings of Ali et al. (2014) that the student teachers’ preparation
is influenced by some factors such as insufficient input and the limited supervisory support which
negatively affect their teaching performance. Similarly, results showed that most of the student
teachers were not asked to complete evaluation forms nor they were requested to keep notes and
diaries on their teaching practice. They were unaware of the effectiveness of reflection and how it
could help them to “respond to the dynamics of the lesson and contextual changes” (Canh, 2014,
p. 217) and manage various challenges and issues that might face them during teaching practice
(Farrell, 2016)
In sum, the results indicated that the student teachers received limited supervisory support and
feedback, had a short teaching practice duration, and a minimal number of observations which
may affect their teaching practice quality. These results support the findings of Endeley (2014)
that highlight the importance of the supervision and duration of teaching practice. Thus, student
teachers might not acquire adequate competencies if one of these components is weak and
consequently, such inadequacies “will affect the quality of the exercise” (p. 157).
Conclusion
In this study, EFL student teachers report several issues and concerns during their teaching practice
that are related to insufficient preparation and inadequate supervisory support. Therefore, the
ETEP in the context of this study fails to prepare the student teachers professionally and adequately
to move from the training context to real classroom teaching. This drawback may be triggered

because of the four-year syllabus structure which is not up to the requirements of the standards as
most of the pedagogical content knowledge courses are taught in their first language (Al-Jaro,
Asmawi, & Hasim, 2017). On top of that, there is a need for rethinking and paying much attention
to the ETEP with respect to course structure, supervision and duration. This will help
administrators to reconstruct the university courses and enhance student teachers’ content
knowledge and pedagogical skills that are necessary for their teaching context. Besides, it could
activate the role of supervision by assigning expert supervisors who have been trained in mentoring
skills to supervise and observe the student teachers and provide them with the necessary support
and feedback. On a pedagogical level, the present paper supports the notion that studying the
student/prospective teachers’ live experiences may pinpoint their problems and challenges
encountered during practice and provide TEPs with insights to promote the desired outcomes.
In conclusion, it should be noted here that this study has some limitations. Thus, it is
acknowledged that the study findings are limited to the study context and cannot be generalized to
other settings. One limitation is the study context which is ETEP at the Faculty of Education, at a
public university in Yemen. Hence, similar studies are recommended to be carried out on other
ETEPs in similar contexts. Another limitation is the focus of this study and the adoption of the
survey method to collect data. While this does not lessen the worth of the study, it would be
suggested if a further study deeply investigates the classroom implementation and the supervisory
support by observing the student teachers’ teaching practice and interviewing their supervisors.
This would provide some different findings and realities that could describe ETEP for professional
teaching practice. Despite these limitations, this study might provide some insights for similar
educational contexts, useful suggestions and valuable information for teacher educators,
programme directors and decision makers.
