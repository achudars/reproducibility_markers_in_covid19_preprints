Abstract
Tornadoes account for nearly one fifth of all natural hazard fatalities in the United States,
yet there exist no general estimates of casualty rates across the country. Here tornado
casualty rates are estimated for all casualty-producing tornadoes over the period 1995–2016
using tornado level information related to the population and total housing units within
each damage path. The 22-year United States per-capita casualty rate is 2.3%, while the
22-year United States per-housing unit casualty rate is 5.4%. Injury and fatality rates are
also estimated over the same period. The 22-year United States per-capita fatality rate
is .15% and the per-capita injury rate is 2.1%. The per-housing unit fatality rate is .36%
and the per-housing unit injury rate is 5.1%. Casualty rates are further examined through
subsets of Enhanced Fujita rating, state boundaries, and county boundaries. When used in
conjunction with estimates of future changes in tornado behavior and population growth,
these casualty rates can help predict tornado casualty events in communities throughout the
United States.

1. Introduction
Tornadoes are violently rotating columns of wind that pose a threat to life and property.
They account for nearly one fifth of all natural hazard fatalities in the United States (U.S.)
alone (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, 2015). While the destruction of
a community’s built environment can severely disrupt economic productivity, perhaps no
impact of a tornado is felt deeper than the resulting casualties—injuries or deaths.
Previous research has largely focused on the number or location of tornado casualties—
often tornado fatalities (Grazulis, 1990; Hammer and Schmidlin, 2000; Ashley, 2007; Fricker
et al., 2017b). For example, Grazulis (1990) provides a historical collection of significant and
killer tornado reports, which highlights changes in the rate of tornado fatalities over time
(Brooks and Doswell, 2002). Hammer and Schmidlin (2000) investigate vehicle-associated
deaths in tornadoes over the period 1900—1998 and find that vehicle-occupant deaths were
consistent in relative proportion to all location-specific deaths from 1959–1979, but decreased
significantly between 1980–1989. Arguably the most comprehensive analysis of tornado
fatalities is seen in Ashley (2007), where spatial and temporal consideration are given to all
tornado fatalities between 1880–2005. Results from Ashley (2007) show a larger number of

fatalities occurring in the lower-Arkansas, Tennessee, and Mississippi River valleys of the
southeastern United States. These results are further supported by Fricker et al. (2017b)
who use a dasymetric method to map tornado casualties—injuries and fatalities—over the
period 1955–2016.
Factors that influence the number of tornado casualties are well known. Wind energy
and population density explain a large portion of tornado casualty rates (Ashley et al., 2014;
Fricker et al., 2017a; Elsner et al., 2018a), with socioeconomic and demographic factors also
playing a role (Simmons and Sutter, 2005, 2008, 2009; Donner, 2007; Dixon and Moore,
2012; Lim et al., 2017; Strader and Ashley, 2018). For example, Simmons and Sutter (2005,
2008, 2009) find that the number of tornado casualties increases with an increase in the
percentage of mobile homes in an area. In addition, Kilijanek and Drabek (1979), Cutter
et al. (2000), Dixon and Moore (2012), and Donner et al. (2012) find that an increase in
the number of elderly individuals (age 65 and older) is likely to result in an increase in the
number of tornado—or more generally, natural hazard—casualties.
Less understood are general casualty rates—that is, on average, how many injuries and
deaths occur per person or per housing unit in casualty-producing tornadoes. Put another
way, how many injuries and deaths occur in casualty-producing tornadoes given an estimated
number of people and housing units within the tornado damage path. Previous research
(Eidson et al., 1990; Legates and Biddle, 1999; Daley et al., 2005; Brooks et al., 2008;
Corfidi et al., 2010; Kuligowski et al., 2013) has focused on case studies to gain insight
into the number or rate of tornado injuries and fatalities. For instance, Brooks et al. (2008)
synthesized results from previous studies to show that, historically, tornado fatality rates have
ranged from 0.1% within the 3 May, 1999 Oklahoma City, Oklahoma EF5 tornado (Daley
et al., 2005) to 1.0% in the 8 April, 1998 Birmingham, Alabama EF4 tornado (Legates and
Biddle, 1999). Regarding injuries, Eidson et al. (1990), Brown et al. (2002), and Corfidi
et al. (2010) find a ratio between the number of tornado fatalities and tornado injuries to be
approximately 16, 15, and 17 injuries for each fatality, respectively, while Kuligowski et al.
(2013) finds a ratio of approximately 6 injuries for each fatality.
Predicting scenarios of occurrence is one way to estimate the impact future tornadoes
can have on society. These predictions are typically made through Monte Carlo simulations
(Meyer et al., 2002; Daneshvaran and Morden, 2007; Strader et al., 2017) and incorporate
potential changes to physical or social environments. For example, Strader et al. (2017) use
the Tornado Impact Monte Carlo (TorMC) model to simulate tornado events and estimate
the impact or cost on the underlying surface. Using future projections of the dispersal and
number of housing units (the Spatially Explicit Regional Growth Model and the Integrated
Climate and Land Use Scenarios), they find a potential threefold increase in median annual
tornado impact—in housing units—when accounting for changes in risk and exposure over
the period 2010–2100. More recently, Fan and Pang (2019) use a stochastic track model to
generate genesis locations of tornadoes and calculate annual spawn frequencies by Enhanced
Fujita (EF) Scale rating for four major U.S. cities—Indianapolis, Indiana, Birmingham, Alabama, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and Des Moines, Iowa. They find the highest significant
tornado (EF2+) annual spawn frequency in Birmingham, Alabama, indicating high future
tornado risk across portions of the southeastern United States.
Reconstructing past events is another way to estimate the impact future tornadoes can
have on society. Using historical tornado track data and transposing it onto modern land2

scapes makes it possible to identify worst-case scenarios of tornado destruction (Wurman
et al., 2007; Hall and Ashley, 2008; Ashley et al., 2014; Elsner et al., 2018c; Antonescu et al.,
2018). For example, Elsner et al. (2018c) overlay historical tornado paths onto fine-scale
Florida property value data and find a 1% chance that the annual loss will exceed $430 million and 0.1% chance that the annual loss will exceed $1 billion. Similarly, Antonescu et al.
(2018) rearrange tornadoes from the historical 24–25 June, 1967 European outbreak to estimate what the event might look like if it occurred today. Using fatality rates ranging from
0.1% to 1.0% (Legates and Biddle, 1999; Daley et al., 2005; Brooks et al., 2008), and injury
rates of 15 injuries per fatality, they find the same outbreak—were it to happen today—could
result in the destruction of over 24,000 buildings, and produce 25–2,580 injuries, as well as
17–172 fatalities.
These future predictions and worst-case scenarios (Clarke, 2005) signal the importance
of understanding societal risk and vulnerability to the tornado hazard. While relying on
case-study estimates of tornado injuries and fatalities is useful for predicting the destructive
potential of tornadoes on the same or a similar location, they do little to provide insight into
what to expect in a casualty-producing tornado at any location across the country—or the
world. In response, here tornado casualty rate estimates are made for all casualty-producing
tornadoes impacting the United States between 1995–2016. These rates exist as a function
of population (per-capita) and households (per-housing unit) and apply generally across
space—or more specifically, the contiguous United States. Through a spatial and temporal
examination of tornado casualty rates, this work stands to provide a foundation for future
research concerning the prediction of what changes in physical or social environments may
mean to the rate of tornado casualties.
2. Data and Methods
2.1. Historical Tornado Reports
Tornado reports are obtained from the U.S. Storm Prediction Center (SPC). The SPC
database is the most complete and detailed tornado database in the world and includes
information related to the spatial location and dimensions of the damage path, the initiation
point (latitude and longitude), date, and maximum damage rating from 0 to 5 (Fujita (F)
Scale prior to February 2007 and EF Scale thereafter). Important for this work, it also
includes the number of casualties—fatalities and injuries. “Casualty”, as defined by the
National Weather Service (NWS) Storm Data, refers to either human death or injury as a
direct consequence of a tornado.
Tornado reports in the database are compiled initially by local NWS oﬃces and reviewed
by the National Center for Environmental Information (Verbout et al., 2006) before entering
the database. The SPC database is available in a shapefile format (https://www.spc.noaa.
gov/gis/svrgis/) with each tornado represented as a straight-line track between the start
and end locations or an initiation point. Here all casualty-producing tornadoes—tornadoes
that produced one injury or death—in the database over the period 1995–2016 are considered.
The start year coincides with the period of record where maximum path width was adopted
by the NWS and represents the start of a period of record consistent in tabulation methods.

2.2. Population and Housing Data
Population and housing data are obtained from the United States Census Bureau and
the American Community Survey (ACS). The boundary shapefiles are obtained from the
topologically integrated geographic encoding and referencing (TIGER) database. The ACS
is a nationwide survey that includes demographic, social, economic, and housing information
by year at the state, county, tract, block group, and block level.
Here, population and housing data are evaluated at the Census tract level so as to be large
enough to include the entire region of interest and small enough to provide more detailed
information than other geographies. The study includes information from the 1990 and 2000
Census, as well as the 2010 ACS five-year estimates. Diﬀerences in the quality of data exist
between the 1990 and 2000 Census and the 2010 ACS. This is because of a diﬀerence in data
collection strategy, which resulted in approximately 19 million households being sampled in
the 2000 Census and approximately 3.54 million households in the ACS (Folch et al., 2016).
While there are a number of challenges associated with using ACS data (Macdonald, 2006;
Salvo and Lobo, 2006; Bazuin and Fraser, 2013; Spielman et al., 2014; Folch et al., 2016),
reliable estimates of socioeconomic or demographic variables are rooted in the margins of
error (MOE) of the ACS. For the two variables of interest (total population and total housing
units), the average associated MOE are below 10% with an interquartile range between 6%
and 10% for total population and between 3% and 6% for total housing units (Fricker, 2020).
2.3. Tornado Model and Dasymetric Method
Tornado paths are made using a buﬀer on the straight line track in accordance with
recorded maximum path width. Estimates of total population and housing units are computed for each tornado, using a dasymetric procedure similar to that used in Fricker et al.
(2017b) and further explained in Fricker (2020). The procedure requires two sets of volumetric data: the spatial path of the tornado and the demographic data and its areal
representation as Census tracts.
The dasymetric calculations are made using weighted estimates of population and housing
units for each fraction of the tornado path as a ratio of the fraction of the tornado path that
occurs within a Census tract and the total area of the Census tract. When added together,
the weighted estimates result in a total estimate of population and housing units for the
entire tornado path. Final estimates are calculated through linear interpolation based on
the year of occurrence. Tornadoes on or after 2010 are assigned estimates of the year 2010.
The result of the implementation of the dasymetric method is a data set similar in structure to the SPC database, with additional columns present, including total population and
total housing units. Given the nature of the tornado model used here, it is reasonable to
assume potential error in the estimates due to the use of a straight line track buﬀered in accordance with recorded maximum width. However, as Fricker (2020) shows, the percent error
between modeled damage path estimates and actual damage path estimates from the NWS
Damage Assessment Toolkit (https://apps.dat.noaa.gov/stormdamage/damageviewer/)
is less than 5% for both total population and total housing units, indicating the methodology
is quite useful.
With estimates of total population and total housing units in a data set that includes
information on recorded tornado casualties (injuries and fatalities), location, date, time, and
maximum damage rating, it is possible to subset tornadoes by their characteristics. For
4

example, when subset by maximum damage rating (EF scale), estimates can be made for
total population and total housing units (Table 1). When leveraged with information on the
number of tornadoes and the number of tornado casualties, per-capita and per-housing unit
casualty rates can be estimated.

3. Results
3.1. General Casualty Rates
General casualty rates are calculated for every U.S. casualty-producing tornado over
the period 1995–2016. For the 22-year study period, there were 2,201 casualty-producing
tornadoes that resulted in 25,959 casualties. The sum of the estimated population within
the path of these tornadoes is 1,129,460 and the sum of the estimated housing units within
the path of these tornadoes is 479,778, which corresponds to a per-capita casualty rate of
2.3% and a per-housing unit casualty rate of 5.4% (Table 2).
General casualty rates can be further broken down into injury and fatality rates. For the
22-year study period, there were 472 killer tornadoes—those that resulted in one or more
fatalities—producing 1,730 fatalities. There were also 2,121 injury-producing tornadoes—
those that resulted in one or more injuries—producing 24,229 injuries. This corresponds to
a per-capita fatality rate of .15% and a per-capita injury rate of 2.1% (Table 2). In addition,
this corresponds to a per-housing unit fatality rate of .36% and a per-housing unit injury
rate of 5.1% (Table 2). When considering the relationship between injuries and fatalities, the
ratio between the number of tornado fatalities and tornado injuries for the set of casualtyproducing tornadoes is 14 injuries for each fatality, consistent with previous research (Eidson
et al., 1990; Brown et al., 2002; Corfidi et al., 2010).

3.2. Casualty Rates by EF-Rating
Owing to the quality of the historical tornado record, casualty rates can also be evaluated
by maximum damage rating (EF-rating). The impact EF-rating has on the number of
tornado casualties is well known, with higher maximum damage ratings resulting in more
5

casualties (Simmons and Sutter, 2005, 2008, 2009), due, in part, to stronger winds and higher
associated energy or power (Fricker et al., 2014; Fricker and Elsner, 2015). Unsurprisingly,
casualty rates increase with EF-rating, with one exception: EF0 tornadoes have a higher
casualty and injury rate than every other maximum damage rating. This result is likely
due to a small number problem, with EF0 tornadoes impacting a much smaller population
(4,432 people) and total housing units (2,071 housing units) than any other EF-rating.
In fact, the next closest total impacted population is EF5 tornadoes with 68,782 people
and 28,204 housing units. Additionally, EF0 tornadoes have historically been used as an
unknown EF-rating (Doswell et al., 2009), which may explain the relatively high number of
EF0 casualty-producing tornadoes and casualty rates seen in this work.
For the set of all casualty-producing tornadoes, the per-capita casualty rate by EFrating—excluding EF0 rates—ranges from a low of 1.5% (EF1 and EF2) to a high of 4.8%
(EF5) (Table 3). In addition, the per-capita fatality rate by EF-rating—excluding EF0
rates—ranges from a low of .05% (EF1) to a high of .60% (EF5), while the per-capita injury
rate by EF-rating—excluding EF0 rates—ranges from a low of 1.4% (EF1) to a high of 4.2%
(EF5). When considering the relationship between injuries and fatalities, the ratio between
the number of tornado fatalities and tornado injuries by EF-rating ranges from a high of 43
injuries for each fatality (EF0) to a low of 7 injuries for each fatality (EF5).

For the same set of all casualty-producing tornadoes, the per-housing unit casualty rate
by EF-rating—excluding EF0 rates—ranges from a low of 3.3% (EF1) to a high of 12%
(EF5) (Table 4). Additionally, the per-housing unit fatality rate by EF-rating—excluding
EF0 rates—ranges from a low of .11% (EF1) to a high of 1.5% (EF5), while the per-housing
unit injury rate by EF-rating—excluding EF0 rates—ranges from a low of 3.2% (EF1) to a
high of 10% (EF5).

3.3. State-Level Casualty Rates
Because the historical tornado record includes information on the spatial location and
dimensions of the damage path, estimated casualty rates can move beyond aspatial measurements into spatial ones. When subset by state, per-capita casualty rates for the set
of casualty-producing tornadoes range from a low of .15% in Michigan to a high of 100%
in Delaware and New Jersey (Fig. 1). The per-capita casualty rates in Delaware and New
Jersey highlight some limitations in the historical record, relative to the spatial path of each
tornado. In fact, the 4 casualty-producing tornadoes that impacted these two states exist as
a buﬀered track with total path areas less than .30 square kilometers, which is far smaller
than the average total path area of a casualty-producing tornado at 7.9 square kilometers.
When these two states are removed, the next highest casualty rate is 40% in Utah.
Figure 1: (A) Per-capita state-level casualty rates for the contiguous United States, and (B) per-capita
state-level casualty rates for states with 10 or more casualty-producing tornadoes. The casualty rates exist
as the number of casualties per person.

To create a more detailed picture of state-level per-capita casualty rates, only those states
with 10 or more casualty-producing tornadoes are considered (Fig. 1). Of the group of states
with a history of many casualty-producing tornadoes, per-capita casualty rates range from
a low of .15% in Michigan to a high of 38% in South Dakota.
There appears to be a
7

pattern of high per-capita casualty rates for states in the northern Great Plains, Midwest,
and Southeast. Indeed, nine of the top ten states with the highest casualty rates (South
Dakota, North Dakota, Louisiana, Ohio, Arkansas, Kentucky, Florida, Illinois, and Iowa)
exist in these regions of the United States.
State-level per-capita injury and fatality rates follow a similar structure to state-level
casualty rates. For the set of all casualty-producing tornadoes, the per-capita fatality rate
by state ranges from a low of 0% in eight states (California, Idaho, Connecticut, Maine, West
Virginia, Oregon, Arizona, and Delaware) to a high of 43% in New Jersey. The per-capita
injury rate by state ranges from a low of .15% in Michigan to a high of 100% in Delaware
and New Jersey. When considering the set of states with 10 or more casualty-producing
tornadoes, per-capita fatality rates drop to a high of 1.1% in South Dakota, while per-capita
injury rates drop to a high of 37% in South Dakota.
When subset by state, per-housing unit casualty rates for the same set of casualty producing tornadoes range from a low of .38% in Michigan to a high of of 100% in Delaware
and New Jersey (Fig. 2)—again likely due to the small estimated damage path area of the
casualty-producing tornadoes impacting those states. Of the same group of states with a
history of many casualty-producing tornadoes, per-housing unit casualty rates range from a
low of .38% in Michigan to a high of 90% in South Dakota. In addition, the per-housing unit
fatality rate by state ranges from a low of 0% in the same eight states to a high of 47% in
New Jersey. The per-housing unit injury rate by state ranges from a low of .36% in Michigan
to 100% in Delaware and New Jersey. When considering only those states with 10 or more
casualty-producing tornadoes, the per-housing unit fatality rates drop to a high of 26% and
the per-housing unit injury rate drops to a high of 87%, both in South Dakota.
Though the relative order of casualty rates by state do not change much between percapita and per-housing unit estimates, the magnitude of the casualty rates do. For example,
while the per-capita casualty rate of the state of South Dakota is 39%, the per-housing
unit casualty rate of the same state is 90%. Similarly, while the per-capita casualty rate of
Montana is 34%, the per-housing unit casualty rate is 65%. One reason for this diﬀerence is
likely due, in part, to the relationship between population and housing units in rural states
(e.g. North Dakota and South Dakota), where older individuals live in aging and low quality
housing. Another reason is likely due to the small number of total housing units impacted
by casualty-producing tornadoes—relative to the number of people—in states with high
casualty rates.
3.4. County-Level Casualty Rates
Overlaying the spatial location and dimensions of tornado damage paths onto U.S. counties allows for an estimation of county-level casualty rates. When tornadoes are subset by
the counties they intersect (1401 total counties), per-capita casualty rates for the set of all
casualty-producing tornadoes range from a low of .01% in Montgomery and Schenectady
County, New York to a high of 99% in Williamsburg County, South Carolina (Fig. 3). Because the sample size of casualty-producing tornado occurrence in many U.S. counties is
small, only those counties impacted by multiple (> 1) casualty-producing tornadoes (677
total counties) are considered to gain insight into casualty rates that are more likely to
explain potential patterns in the distribution of casualties. Of the group of counties with

multiple casualty-producing tornadoes, per-capita casualty rates range from a low of .02%
in St. Charles County, Missouri to a high of 74% in Little River County, Arkansas (Fig. 3).
County-level per-capita injury and fatality rates are similar to county-level casualty rates.
For the set of casualty-producing tornadoes, the per-capita fatality rate by county ranges
from a low of 0 in over half (55%) of the counties to a high of 80% in Beaver County,
Oklahoma and Lipscomb County, Texas. The per-capita injury rate by county ranges from
a low of 0% in 28 counties to a high of 99% in Williamsburg County, South Carolina. For
the group of counties impacted by multiple casualty-producing tornadoes, per-capita fatality
rates drop to a high of 18% in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana, while per-capita injury rates
drop to a high of 68% in Little River County, Arkansas.
When the same set of all casualty-producing tornadoes subset by county is considered
(1401 total counties), per-housing unit casualty rates range from a low of .03% in Montgomery and Schenectady County, New York to a high of 100% in 84 counties (Fig. 4). These
county-level per-housing unit casualty rates change to a low of .06% in St. Charles County,
Missouri and a high of 100% in 14 counties when subset by counties impacted by multiple
casualty-producing tornadoes (677 total counties) (Fig. 4). County-level per-housing unit

fatality rates range from a low of 0% in the same 55 counties mentioned above to a high
of 100% in Beaver County, Oklahoma, and Lipscomb County and Maverick County, Texas.
County-level injury rates range from a low of 0% in 28 counties to a high of 100% in 78
counties. For the group of counties impacted by multiple county-producing tornadoes, the
per-housing unit fatality rate drops to a high of 47% in Evangeline Parish, Louisiana and
the per-housing unit injury rate remains at a high of 100%, but only for 11 counties.
As was seen in the relationship between per-capita and per-housing unit casualty rates at
the state-level, county-level casualty rates are higher, on average, at the per-housing unit level
than at the per-capita level. The reason for this is again likely due to the relationship between
population and housing units across rural counties of the U.S.—where older individuals live in
aging and low quality housing—and the fact that, on average, casualty-producing tornadoes
at the county-level impact more people than housing units.
3.5. Tornado-Level Casualty Rates
With a data set similar in structure to the SPC database—where tornado reports exist
as separate rows—it is possible to analyze casualty rates at the individual tornado level.
Thus, the data set can be thought of as a group of case studies for tornado casualty events.
Important for this work is the ability to compare and contrast casualty rates across a number of casualty-producing tornadoes that impact a number of diﬀerent areas with diﬀerent
underlying populations.
When evaluated at the individual tornado level, it is clear that using high profile casualty
events as a basis for future casualty scenarios can become problematic. In fact, the most
high profile casualty events (i.e. top 10 casualty-producing tornadoes) over the past two
decades have estimated per-capita casualty rates that range from a low of 3% (3 May, 1999
Oklahoma City (Moore), Oklahoma EF5 tornado) to a high of 48% (22 May, 2011 Joplin,
Missouri EF5 tornado) and estimated per-housing unit casualty rates that range from a low
of 8% (3 May, 1999 Oklahoma City (Moore), Oklahoma EF5 tornado) to a high of 27% (26
December, 2015 Garland-Rowlett, Texas EF4 tornado).
Limitations in using case studies as the foundation for tornado casualty prediction can
be seen in the diﬀerences in casualty patterns within individual events. For example, the
26 December, 2015 Garland-Rowlett, Texas EF4 tornado, which resulted in 478 casualties
(10 fatalities and 468 injuries), had a per-capita casualty rate of 9.9% and a per-housing
unit casualty rate of 27%. These rates are significantly diﬀerent than the 17 November,
2013 Washington, Illinois EF4 tornado, which resulted in 128 casualties (3 fatalities and 125
injuries), and had a per-capita casualty rate of 3.4% and a per-housing unit casualty rate of
8.1%.
Of the ten case studies analyzed in this work, the per-capita casualty rates range from a
low of 1% in the 1 June, 2011 Springfield, Massachusetts EF3 tornado to a high of 100% in the
30 May, 1998 Spencer, South Dakota EF4 tornado (Table 5). The per-housing unit casualty
rates range from a low of 2.3% in the 14 March, 2008 Atlanta, Georgia EF2 tornado—and
the aforementioned 2011 Springfield, Massachusetts EF3 tornado—to a high of 100% in the
30 May, 1998 Spencer, South Dakota EF4 tornado (Table 5). Thus, while the use of case
studies can aid in the production of knowledge about specific tornado casualty events, the
use of case studies to predict what will happen, on average, in a casualty-producing tornado

4. Discussion
Predicting future tornado impacts on society is a diﬃcult endeavor. It relies on an understanding of connections between tornadoes and a changing climate, as well as connections
between tornadoes and a changing population. Recent studies find upward trends in the
interannual variability and clustering of tornadoes over the past few decades (Brooks et al.,
2014; Elsner et al., 2015; Tippett et al., 2015). They also find a shift in the areal extent of
tornado occurrence (Agee et al., 2016; Moore, 2017), and increasing tornado power (Elsner
et al., 2018b). Other research argues that an increase in total population and dispersal of
the built environment will lead to an increase in the amount of tornado destruction (Strader
et al., 2017).
What impacts the relationship between tornadoes, climate, and society will have on
humans—in the form of casualties—remains an open and challenging question. This is, in
part, due to a lack of research that aims to understand tornado casualties as a global measure,
rather than independent or case-study events. In response, here casualty rates are estimated
for all casualty-producing tornadoes over the past several decades. These rates exist across
multiple temporal and spatial scales and provide a foundation for the prediction of tornado
casualties across the United States. For example, with a 22-year per-capita casualty rate
of 2.3%, a tornado impacting a community of 5,000 people would, on average, result in a
casualty count of 115 people. That number can be broken down further into fatality and
injury estimates of 8 and 107 people, respectively.
The utility of these casualty rates can also be seen in their flexibility to help predict
casualty numbers based on tornado characteristics. For instance, because tornado reports
include information on the magnitude of the associated damage (EF Scale), these casualty
rates can be estimated for each EF-rating. This means that prediction of impacts can exist
across damage thresholds. In practice, for the same community of 5,000 people, an EF5
tornado would, on average, result in 240 casualties with 31 fatalities and 209 injuries, while
an EF2 tornado would, on average, result in 76 casualties with 4 fatalities and 72 injuries.
13

Having the spatial extent of tornado damage paths allows for an understanding of tornado casualty rates across political boundaries (e.g. state-level and county-level). While
state-level casualty rates may not be overly useful for specific events—a tornado impacting southern Alabama will aﬀect diﬀerent communities and diﬀerent people than a tornado
impacting northern Alabama—it does provide broad-scale knowledge of place-based human
vulnerability. More useful, however, may be casualty rates at the county-level. For example,
based on historical tornado reports and Census estimates, a community in Mitchell County,
Georgia is likely to have more casualties than a community in Fulton County, Georgia at
the per-capita level. In fact, a 200 person community in Mitchell County impacted by a
casualty-producing tornado would result, on average, in 99 casualties, while a 200 person
community in Fulton County impacted by a casualty-producing tornado would result, on
average, in 1 casualty.
Another way to think about casualty rates, beyond a per-capita measurement, is at
the housing unit level. The use of housing units as a damage statistic is not new (Ashley
et al., 2014) and the quality of housing in an area is likely to impact the number of tornado
casualties. Thus, a per-housing unit casualty rate may be useful to development planners
and present a proxy for inadequate housing in communities across the country. With a
22-year per-housing unit casualty rate of 5.4%, a 1,000 housing unit community impacted
by a casualty-producing tornado would, on average, result in 271 casualties. Of these 271
casualties, 18 would, on average, be fatalities with the other 253 being injuries. Over the
study period, the average number of total housing units impacted by casualty-producing
tornadoes is 218, which corresponds to 12 casualties, of which 1 is likely to be a fatality and
11 are likely to be injuries.
At the state- and county-level, both per-capita and per-housing unit casualty rates are
higher for states and counties with larger rural communities than those states and counties
with larger urban communities. When subset by Rural-Urban Continuum Codes and Oﬃce
of Management and Budget metro and nonmetro categories, the per-capita casualty rate for
rural communities is 3.2%, while the per-capita casualty rate for urban communities is 1.6%.
Similarly, the per-housing unit casualty rate for rural communities is 7.3%, while the perhousing unit casualty rate for urban communities is 3.9%. This is likely responsible for the
high casualty rates—relative to other states—consistently found in North Dakota and South
Dakota, which both have extremely high rural populations of 40% and 43%, respectively.
The reason for such a contrast in casualty rates between rural and urban communities may
be due to diﬀerences in the types of relationships that exist in these areas (Donner, 2007), or
due to low population and housing unit numbers in addition to older populations and poorquality housing. Regardless of the reasons behind an increased casualty rate, it is important
to identify that rural communities are at a higher risk for casualties than others. For example,
at the per-capita level, there is a hotspot of high casualty rates in the Ark-La-Tex region. If
a casualty-producing tornado impacts a rural community of 200 people in Red River County,
Texas, or Little River County, Arkansas the expected casualty rates are between 120–150
people. Conversely, if a casualty-producing tornado impacts an urban community is Dallas
County, Texas, or Pulaski, Arkansas, the expected casualty rates are between 4–10 people. In
addition, at the housing-unit level a large swath of high casualty rates exists across counties
in southern Georgia and southern Alabama. If a casualty-producing tornado impacts a rural
community of 100 housing units in Grady, Mitchell, Thomas, or Worth County, Georgia,
14

the expected casualty rates are between 37–47 people. Conversely, if a casualty-producing
tornado impacts an urban community of 100 housing units in Dekalb, Fulton, of Gwinnett
County, Georgia, the expected casualty rates are between 0–1 person.
As tornado behavior—and social structures and orgnization—continues to evolve, so
too must our understanding of the societal impacts of these phenomena. While having
estimates of future tornado damage (e.g. the number of housing units or total property loss)
is important, having estimates of the number or rate of tornado casualties is equally as
important. If tornado occurrence is relatively shifting to the East-Southeast and tornado
outbreaks are becoming more concentrated (Gensini and Brooks, 2018; Moore and McGuire,
2019) with increased power, then leveraging this information for more accurate estimates of
tornado casualties has the potential to spark mitigation strategies or educational outreach
programs that can save lives.
5. Summary
Previous research has used statistical methods, most notably Monte Carlo simulations,
to estimate the impact future tornadoes can have on society. It has also looked toward case
studies to make sense of the number or rate of tornado injuries and fatalities. Here, general
casualty rates are explored for all casualty-producing tornadoes over the period 1995–2016.
Through the use of a dasymetric procedure to gain tornado-level information, 22-year
casualty rates are explored at the per-capita and per-housing unit level. Results show a
per-capita casualty rate of 2.3% over the period with a per-capita fatality rate of .15% and a
per-capita injury rate of 2.1% over the time period. In addition, results show a per-housing
unit casualty rate of 5.4% with a per-housing unit fatality rate of .36% and a per-housing
unit injury rate of 5.1% over the same study period.
Casualty rates increase with EF-rating with one exception: EF0 tornadoes have a higher
casualty and injury rate than every other maximum damage rating. This is likely due to a
combination of a small number problem, as EF0 tornadoes impact much smaller populations
and total housing units than any other category, and the use of EF0 as an unknown rating.
When subset by EF-rating, per-capita tornado casualty rates—excluding EF0 rates—range
from a low of 1.5% (EF1 and EF2) to a high of 4.8% (EF5). At the per-housing unit level,
tornado casualty rates—excluding EF0 rates—range from a low of 3.3% (EF1) to a high of
12% (EF5).
Spatially, tornado casualty rates at both the per-capita and per-housing unit level are
higher for states and counties with larger rural populations than those with smaller rural
populations. For the set of states impacted by 10 or more casualty-producing tornadoes, percapita casualty rates range from a low of .15% in Michigan to a high of 38% in South Dakota.
For the same set of states, the per-housing unit casualty rates range from a low of .38% in
Michigan to a high of 90% in South Dakota. Additionally, for the set of counties impacted
by multiple casualty-producing tornadoes, the per-capita casualty rates range from a low of
.02% in St. Charles County, Missouri to a high of 74% in Little River County, Arkansas.
For the same set of counties, the per-housing unit casualty rates range from a low of .06%
in St. Charles County, Missouri to a high of 100% in 14 counties across Alabama, Arkansas,
Georgia, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Florida, and Texas.

15

Specific characteristics (e.g. EF-rating and spatial location) were analyzed in more detail
to provide diﬀerent choices to estimate future casualty scenarios in communities across the
country. While this work focused on providing a foundation for casualty prediction, the
method to estimate casualty rates allows for the creation of other research questions related
to tornado casualties and their association with tornado behavior. For example, future work
could evaluate diﬀerences in the rate of tornado casualties between daytime and nocturnal
tornadoes or diﬀerences in the rate of tornado casualties at the seasonal—monthly—level.
In addition, it is important to note that when predicting future casualty scenarios there
are a number of other factors (e.g. mobile home density, housing quality, etc.) that can
be evaluated in the context of tornado casualties over a longer period of record—tornado
reports date back to 1950—which may result in better interpretation of diﬀerences across
space and time.
Ultimately, these per-capita and per-housing unit casualty rates are provided to improve
the current prediction of tornado casualties. The hope is that emergency managers, meteorologists, and planners can use these rates to better prepare for tornado casualty events in their
local communities. To that end, by expressing casualty rates across temporal and spatial
scales, this work gives public oﬃcials multiple ways to better understand their community’s
human vulnerability and develop mitigation strategies or educational outreach programs that
can reduce the loss of life and property.
