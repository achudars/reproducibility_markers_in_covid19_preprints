Abstract
Increasing housing cost is one of the major concerns among young parents in South Korea.
The aim of this study is to evaluate how homeownership is associated with parity-specific
birth. We use the 2009-2017 waves of the Korea Labor and Income Panel Study (n=6,934) to
illustrate opt-out childbearing without the state of being a homeowner. This study uses the
Cox proportional hazard model to show mutually-exclusive patterns between homeownership
and childbearing. The results suggest that either short-term rent or home-ownership is
negative to have a first child while only home-ownership is negative to have a second child.
Also, rural areas show a slightly faster path in having a second child. The Cox proportional
hazard model suggests that there is a trade-off relationship between parity-specific
childbearing and housing costs intertwined with employment status and educational
attainment.

Keywords: housing types, parity of birth, postponement

1. Introduction
For the first time in South Korea (hereafter Korea), total fertility rates (TFR) is estimated
to have dropped below 1.0 in 2018, reaching a value of 0.977 (Korea Statistical Information
Service, 2019). Since the Asian Foreign Exchange Crisis in 1997 had negative impacts on the
lives of the younger generation, the lowest-low fertility has been furthered with delaying
marriage and postponing childbearing in Korea (Eun, 2007; Lee & Choi, 2015).
Actual fertility outcomes in Korea show a substantial mismatch with fertility desires
which is about two children even when TFR was 1.2 in 2011 (Korean General Social Survey,
2012),. Recent studies highlight an increase in the age of first marriage and a trend of
remaining as single, influenced by the economic conditions: unaffordable housing costs, weak
public pension plans, and high childrearing costs (Kwon, 2007; Yoo, 2016). Instead of
devoting lifetime resources to childrearing and ensuing costs, young generations in Korea
tend to allocate more financial resources to homeownership (Lee & Choi, 2015).
The literature regarding the determinants of fertility decline sheds light on occupational
instability, incompatibility between work and family, lack of efficient pro-natalist policies,
emergence of the “quality” child, costs of childrearing, and difficulties of the urban
environment (Becker, 1960; McDonald, 2000; Morgan, 2001; Friedman et al., 1994, Jones
2007). However, relatively few studies discuss how a specific financial determinant influences
parity-specific birth; the difficulties in owning a home, the uncertainty after retirement, and
occupational instability stand in the way of attaining their desired childbearing (Lee at al.,
2000; Eun, 2007; Urasawa & Jones, 2014).
In Korea, not only the postponement of childbearing but also the early termination of
childbearing after the first child affect lowest-low fertility (Frejka, Jones, & Sardon, 2010).
This study examines how housing types and living area act as an economic cost to affect
parity-specific birth outcomes. Also, this study proposes that the timing and the parity of birth
2

are related to homeownership and that one way in which to address the continued decline in
fertility in Korea would be to address the affordability of housing within the country, with
particular focus on dense urban areas. We used the 2009-2017 waves of Korea Labor and
Income Panel Study (KLIPS) to describe how homeownership impede fertility, focusing on
the following period after the Great Recession.
2. Backgrounds
Korean households have rooted preference for real estate properties in their asset
portfolios. Liepziger et al. (2015) suggest that Korean families retain more than 75 percent of
their total assets in real estate, which is far higher than that of other OECD countries.
Moreover, the excessive demand for housing has engendered a dangerous level of household
debt which accounts for 164 percent of the net disposable income in 2012, compared to OECD
average of 133 percent (Jones & Kim, 2014). Since the economic crisis in 1997, Koreans have
a sensitivity toward economic uncertainty because of growing concerns about future
residential housing bubbles (Jones & Kim, 2014).
Since the housing bubble in the early 2000s, the housing costs of either owning or renting
has increased substantially. The Korean public housing provision is neither public rental
housing as welfare benefits nor market-oriented operation (Lee, & Ronald, 2012). Korea has
a prevalent and peculiar system for renting, named “Jeon-Se,” that refers to a long-term lease
with about 70 percent of down payment but no monthly rent. Still, the high costs of “Jeon-Se”
from the continuous increase in house prices frustrate young Koreans because it presents a
tremendous expense they must account for when they marry and before they have children
(Lee & Choi, 2015).
Soaring housing costs represent a substantial economic constraint to be overcome by
young Korean families, and, we propose, and which has been suggested elsewhere (Eun,

3

2007), that this could be a barrier to initial family formation and timing of fertility decision in
Korea. Similarly, it is unequivocal that housing conditions and economic uncertainty
influence the postponement of family formation in Western societies as well (Mills, Rindfuss,
McDonald, & te Velde, 2011). Regional differences in housing costs can affect family size,
which acts as an equilibrium mechanism; low fertility could represent a compromise to the
demand for housing. Thus, the decision not to have children could result in more freedom of
choices in the housing market. If the economic constraint of high housing costs could be
eliminated, it could eventually motivate higher fertility (Feyrer, Sacerdote, & Stern, 2008).
Economic literature suggests that the likelihood of being apart from the parental home and
living alone are lower in expensive housing markets than low housing cost areas. (Haurin et
al., 1993). Enström Öst (2011) argue that among the young cohorts, there is a possible
simultaneity between homeownership and the birth of the first child in Sweden. Simmon and
Tamura (2009) highlight that fertility was lower in more expensive housing markets over time
and across the U.S. metropolitan areas. Other than place effects, individual effects suggest
that there is a concentration of populations with advanced educational attainment, high
household incomes and high housing costs (Clark, 2012). Also, the increase in home price
contributes to a rise in the birth rates among the current homeowners, which is not
implemented for potential first-time homeowners (Dettling & Kearney, 2011).
Ceteris paribus, stable housing conditions and fertility have a positive association. In other
settings, a number of government policies have aimed to increase housing availability for
young people who start families: about 20 percent of total housing units are public housing in
France, there are housing benefit packages for couples with one or more children in the UK,
college students in Norway have housing allowance, and Austria provides financial support
for low-income households (Rindfuss & Kim, 2015). Recently in Korea, national-level public
housing provision focuses on the very poor as welfare policies, as well as local governments,
4

emphasize the young population in its public housing policies (Seo & Joo, 2018).
Nevertheless, public housing in Korea has played a limited role as social welfares and more
likely performed market-friendly roles (Lee & Ronald, 2012).
The importance of housing on fertility is also found in other countries similarly. Fertility
outcomes vary by housing types and size in Finland, which identifies that higher fertility in
single-family houses and lower fertility among living in apartments or condos. Likewise,
fertility rates increase among couples who have changed housing types to single-family
houses (Kulu & Vikat, 2007). Housing prices in China have skyrocketed after urbanization,
which forces young Chinese to postpone family formation both in urban and rural areas (Feng,
2015). Housing policies in the Netherlands, have expanded to provide a sizeable rental
provision for students and young adults, which has produced an inadvertent fertility increase
(Mills, 2015). U.S. Census data shows that the price of living space calculated by rent per
room has a negative correlation with the level of fertility among younger families during the
period between 1940 and 2000 (Simon & Tamura, 2009). Assuming that housing is a
significant portion of overall household budgetary decisions, which also include childraising
costs, the increase in house prices could present an adverse effect on fertility (Mulder & Billari,
2010).
3. Data and methods
The data source for this analysis is the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS).
The KLIPS is a longitudinal survey of the labor market and income activities at both the
household and individual level modeled after the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) in
the United States. The panel design of KLIPS allows for the longitudinal analysis, including
economic decision-making processes and family formation. Also, the KLIPS is conducted
annually on a sample of 5,000 households and members of the families, aged 15 or older.

5

KLIPS began the first wave of data collection in 1998 and had released the 20th wave as of
2017. For this analysis, waves from 2009 to 2017 were merged to generate a life history data
set for married adults. Given that out-of-wedlock births are rare in Korea (Kwon, 2007;
Rindfuss & Choe, 2015), married couples are the population at risk in the current analysis.
The analytical sample consists of adults who were married and between the ages of 15
and 45 at each wave. Married adults are merged based on their household number and the
year of the data; this allows for time-varying characteristics of the husband and wife within
each family to be considered. This generates a couple-centered dataset: a total of 3,279 unique
families contribute a total of 17,776 person-years of time to the data.
Two outcomes are considered in this analysis. First is the time in years between marriage
and the first birth. The second outcome is the interval between the first and second birth. These
two timing variables are common in the fertility literature and represent important indicators
of overall fertility mode and tempo. The first birth interval typically represents the couple’s
overall desire for a child, while the timing between first and second birth represents an
important milestone for couples, where they meet replacement level fertility. Since Korea
faces extremely low fertility levels, the timing and overall pace of having the second birth is
an important aspect to consider.
Controlled covariates consist of demographics and financial determinants other than
housing conditions. Demographic factors include females’ educational attainment, age, and
socioeconomic status (SES). Even though young females who age 15 to 45 have not
completed fertility yet, we thus controlled for the age factor of females in the regression
models. Also, we consider self-rated SES as a proxy for income status at the household level.
Financial determinants other than housing factors adopt employment status of females.
Controlling for the employment status of females is necessary because this study assumes that
females are the primary caregivers and out-of-wedlock births are rare in Korea.
6

Unlike previous studies that analyze fertility outcomes depending on educational
attainment and income (Jones & Urasawa, 2014; Yoo, 2016), this paper focuses on residential
determinants and postponement of fertility by controlling for other socio-economic factors.
Residential determinants consist of housing types and living areas in the Cox proportional
hazard model. Housing type comprises ‘Homeowner’; ‘Long-term renter’; and ‘Short-term
renter.’ Long-Term rent is a unique housing contract in Korea, guaranteeing two years or
longer to rent by paying approximately 70 percent of the market price of a home. Although a
long-term lease has less burdensome than buying a home because of lower lump-sum payment
than purchasing a home, the long-term lease is still an unsecured contract because of the risk
of rent-renewal every two years. Although short-term rent pays a monthly rent without large
payment like long-term rent, the contract duration is usually shorter than one-year, and the
renewal risk exits as well. Financially, the short-term lease is the most expensive housing type
and relatively common among the poor (Lee, 2018). On the other hand, the homeowner pays
the cheapest housing cost even though the lump-sum payment of house price and property tax
are required.
Residential areas consist of urban and rural areas. The urban areas include the city of
Seoul, the capital, and its suburban areas, Gyung-gi province, whereas the rural areas contain
the rest provinces other than Seoul and Gyun-gi province. The Korean population is about 52
million as of 2017. The urban areas occupy about 45 percent of the population, and the other
mid-sized cities and rural areas account for 55 percent of the total population. Not only the
number of residents, but there is also a substantial gap in housing costs between urban and
rural areas. Because of the frustrating housing costs of urban, most young cohorts in
metropolitan areas rent an apartment or studios with a short-term rent contract.
Two main analytical methods are used in this analysis. First, descriptive statistics for each
outcome are computed for each outcome for the key predictors. Secondly, Cox proportional
7

hazard models are used to model the birth intervals. Separate models are constructed for each
outcome, and nested model specifications are used to first examine the baseline differences in
timing to each birth by the key predictors. Also, demographic and socioeconomic controls are
added to the models to observe the net effects of the housing variables on the risk of having a
first and second birth. All analyses are weighted using the supplied population weights for the
KLIPS data, so results are generalizable to the Korean population between 2009 and 2017.
4. Results
Table 1 provides the descriptive results for the two outcomes in the analysis. Descriptive
statistics are stratified by whether a couple had the birth under analysis or not. All results are
weighted to be representative of the adult Korean population using survey design weights
provided by the KLIPS. Except for the first birth interval variable, all variables are tested for
bivariate differences using survey corrected chi-square tests.
[Table 1 here]
With respect to the first birth, it is more common for couples who have a first child to be in a
long term rental than those who did not have a child, and likewise it is more common for those
not having children to either own their own home or live in a short term rental. So, at the
baseline the differences based on housing type are mixed. Concerning demographic
characteristics among ages of 20 to 50, women who had a first birth are younger than women
who did not, and most fathers who had a child are more likely to be between 30 and 40 years
old. 55% of women who had a first birth were unemployed, and those women who had a first
birth were less likely to have a college education or more. Similarly, fathers who had a child
were less likely to have college education or more. There were also differences based on SES
of the household, where lower SES households were more likely to have a first child. There
were no differences based on residential location within the country.

8

Regarding the second birth interval risk set, there were very few differences between those
couples who had a second child and those which did not. Based on housing condition, the
proportions of couples who had a second birth were nearly equally distributed between
owning a home and long term renting, with still a small (9%) fraction of couples living in
short term renting arrangements. The age variables show differences similar to those of the
first birth, where both women and men are more likely to be in the 30’s, and almost no parents
of second children were in their 40’s. No other significant differences between people who
had a second birth were noted in the bivariate analysis.
Table 2 the results from the Cox regression of the first birth interval. Three nested models
for the first birth interval are presented. The first model only includes the independent variable
for the housing type of the couple. Model 2 includes demographic characteristics of the
mother and father, and Model 3 includes the socioeconomic status variables for the mother
and father and a measure of the household’s SES, and urban residence.
[Table 2 here]
As suggested by the descriptive statistics, the baseline results show that couples living in long
term rentals have a higher risk of having a first birth, while those in short term rentals have
lower risk, than those who own a home. Model 2 includes demographic characteristics of the
couple, and net of these controls, the differences between housing types persist, although the
long term rental difference attenuates. Model 3 also includes socioeconomic characteristics
and residential location, and the differences between the housing options persist. In this model,
women’s labor force participation reduces the risk of having a first birth and father’s education
increases the risk, suggesting that economic and housing factors are playing a role in this
outcome. These results aslo suggest that the association between housing choice and variation
in first birth intervals and in the risk of having a first birth, persists net of controls.

9

Table 3 presents the results of the Cox regression models for the second birth outcome.
As with the analysis of the first birth interval, three nested models are presented. In this
analysis, Model 3 also includes the length of the first birth interval, measured in years, as an
indicator of the fecundity of the couple.
[Table 3 here]
The second birth interval analysis, as alluded to by the descriptives show no differences
between housing types in the risk of having a second child, even in the baseline Model 1.
Although no statistically significant risk are attributed, in Model 2 and 3, the relative risk
estimates for the housing indicators, are in the same direction and of approximately the same
magnitude as in the results from the first birth interval. Beside age effects, the only other
variable to show significant association with having a second birth is mother’s labor force
participation, which, as in the first birth analysis, decreases the risk of having a birth.
5. Discussion
Half of Koreans now live in the city of Seoul and its suburban areas (here, classified as
urban areas) because of the rapid urbanization and favorable labor market opportunities. The
expensive housing in Seoul hinders young couples from either owning a home or even from
renting an apartment with a stable contract. This housing burden makes the young generation
save more money at an earlier stage of their lifetime. Furthermore, insufficient job
opportunities in rural areas intertwined with housing concerns occurred with the
postponement of childbearing in Korea.
This study has two large limitations in analysis of KLIPS First is that there is no
information on contraceptive behavior of couples available in the KLIPS data, so there is no
way to assess if the couples are actively limiting their fertility. Secondly, the KLIPS has no
measure of fertility demand by couples, so the patterns seen in the data analyzed in this study

10

may be moot if couples themselves are not interested in having children. Also, this study has
a structural limitation from housing market volatility.
Notwithstanding the above limitations, this study finds evidence of the role housing
factors in childbearing in Korea. Lee et al. (2016) point out the limitation of the current policy
of Korean government that heavily weights on childcare subsidy (Jones, 2009; Lee et al.,
2016). Based on the mutual exclusive relationship between home-ownership and childbearing,
the policy needs to consider alleviating housing concerns of young couples; providing
affordable public housing or more job oppourtunies other than Seoul, the metropolitan capital .
6. Conclusion
Many researchers have described how educational attainment of females and the increase
of FLFP influence lowest-low fertility in Korea (Kim, 2005; Kwon, 2007; Yoo, 2016). Also,
that economic uncertainties regarding occupations and housing relates to the fertility decline
(Eun, 2007; Jones, 2007: Lee & Choi, 2015; Sobotka et al., 2011). This paper contributes to
those previous studies with an analysis of how a couple’s housing choice influences
childbearing through a parity-specific approach. Indeed, significant variation in risk is seen in
the current analysis, and suggests that couples in short term rental housing show lower risk of
having a child, net of other demographic and human capital indicators, including both parents’
education and female labor force participation. This effect does not carry over to the second
child, suggesting that the limiting factor in play here is the role of housing on the rish of
having a first birth. This suggests that the family formation process itself may be delayed by
the housing options available to families.
According to the Korean Ministry of Health and Welfare (2016), previous fertility policies
aimed to reduce the daycare burden for a parent to achieve compatible work-and-family
schedules. Recently, the Korean government admits that the previous subsidy based policies

11

only marginally affected fertility rates. The results identify that parity-specific childbearing
seems associated with housing concerns and other human capital variables of couples. As a
result, the current generation has to first focus on that housing is first, and parenthood is later
because of soaring housing costs. This study found that housing types are a significant factor
in family formation. We suggest that examining policies related to affordable housing for
parents should be considered, with a focus on making long-term leases more easily accessible
to young married couples.
