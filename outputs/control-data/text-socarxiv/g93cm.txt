"9" "Abstract"
"10" "background"
"11" "The n egative health effects of unemployment are  significant , and the potential for increased morbidity and mortality is a  major   public health   challenge .  Negative  effects  may be  partially  attributable  to   health behavior change  and loss of social ties.  Exercise  has positive physical and mental health benefits and could  help buffer  such  negative effects.  This study examines  whether time in social  and  solitary exercise varies by unemployment and out o f the labor force (OOLF) status   because  exercise, especially social exercise,  provides  health benefits."
"12" "Methods"
"13" "Gender-stratified ordinary least squares models are estimated using  data from the nationally representative 2003-2016 American Time Use Surveys  to  test how own and partner employment status  are  associated with total time in exercise, exercise alone, with children, wi th a partner, and with others ."
"14" "Results"
"15" "Unemployed and OOLF men  spend  more time in exercise alone and with others compared to employed men. Unemployed women  spend  more time in exercise with others, and OOLF women in all types of social exercise, compared to employed women."
"16" "Conclusions"
"17" "Unemployed  and OOLF individuals engage in more social exercise, which could be leveraged to help buffer loss of social ties and improve health.  Exercise-related interventions may help reduce negative  health  consequences of unemployment."

"19" "Introduction"
"20" "The risk of negative health outcomes stemming from unemployment is a concern in many countries. 1-4  Especially in countries with hig h level s of unemployment (e.g., Greece 3 ) and countries with low levels of sup po rt for the unemployed (e.g., UK 1 ), the potential for increased morbidity and mortality arising from unemployment is a significant  public health  concern. Furthermore, there are potential indirect effects of unemployment  on other demographic phenomena, such as relationship formation, fertility, life expectancy, and population structure, resulting from   increases in morbidity and mortality . 5-7  The negative health outcomes of unemployment are though t  to arise from factors such as stress and strain, loss of social ties, reduced resources , and  health behavior changes . 2,8-11  In this paper I focus on the United States, a country with  relatively  limited government support for the unemployed, and I examine one specific health behavior known to have implicati ons for overall health and well being: exercise."
"21" "The  determinants of  exercise  are of interest to many in  public health, medicine, and social science   because   exercise  is associated with mental and physical health  benefits , 12-14  and exercise behaviors can potentially be changed through intervention.  Most  Americans do not meet the minimum guidelines for  exercise , which has implications for population health . 15"
"22" "Some of the  physical and mental health benefits  of exercise   may derive from the social  aspect of exercise.  Some  studies  find  that participants report exercise to be more enjoyable 16   or  stress reducing 17   when  it   is done with  others.   Meta-analyses suggest similar benefits of exercising with others, such as greater adherence to exercise, 18  and better psychological and social health outcomes. 19   Researchers  argue  these gr eater benefits derive  from the social nature  of  participation   (but  mental health benefits  do accrue   from solitary  activity) . 19   Thus,  psychological and quality of life benefits seem to  arise   partly  from social aspects of exercise. 20-21   Yet few  large-scale  studies have examined  patterns of exercise   with others versus alone .  Because  unemployed individuals  are especially prone to stress, relationship strain, and negative health outcomes, 8-9,22  and  because   job loss often results in  disruption of soci al ties , 2,11  exercising with others might be one way  to mitigate  this stress and disruption."
"23" "Unemployment has been examined as a determinant  of exercise , but questions remain. For example, in  couples ,  transitions into and out of unemployment  are  associated with changes in exercis e for women but not men . 28  Women  increase  exercise during unemployment and  reduce  exercise when their partners  experience  unemployment . 28   Yet  it remains unknown whether unemployed individuals exercise with others or  alone , and  how such patterns may differ  by gender or partnership status. For example, perhaps men do not change the ir  amount  of  exercise during unemployment but shift their exercise to be  more social and less solitary. Knowing w ith whom the unemployed exercise (if anyone)  is important for understanding the social benefits of exercise  and whether they might be leveraged to improve health outcomes ."
"24" "This study uses data from the American Time Use Survey  (ATUS)  to examine  with whom individuals exercise, particularly unemployed  and  out of the labor force (OOLF)  individuals.   OOLF individuals are a non-working comparison to the unemployed. Whereas unemployment is an involuntary state, OOLF is a voluntary state, and  there may be  different implications for health and wellbeing.  This study expands on recent research by including single and partnered individuals  and examining  solitary and social  exercise .   Results may help inform future research about  exercise  patterns, especially among the unemployed, and may help inform public health interventions surrounding  exercise  or unemployment  that could reduce potential  demographic consequences of unemployment .   Consistent  with recent  findings , 28   I test two hypotheses :"
"25" "H1 :  Unemployed ,   OOLF , and employed   men will spend similar amounts of time in  total exercise ,   exercise alone , and  exercise  with  children, partners, or others ."
"26" "H2 :  Unemployed and OOLF women will spend more time in  total exercise ,   exercise  alone ,  and  exercise   with  children, partners, or others ,   compared to employed women."
"27" "Methods"
"28" "The data  come s  from  the  2003-2016 waves of the  ATUS ,   which  is a nationally representative time d iary study conducted by the United States  Bureau of Labor Statistics  (BLS)  and the Census Bureau.  Respondents  are interviewed about their time use on the previous day.  The data was  extracted from ATUS-X. 23   Men  and women ages  18-65  are  included  to cover the prime working ages."
"29" "The ke y independent variable  is  own  employment status  at the time of the interview  (=1 if unemployed, =2 if OOLF;  employed is omitted) .  For   partnered individuals , the  partner’s employment status   is  also included, with employed partners being  compared to unemployed/OOLF partners (these  states  cannot be separated for partners) ."
"30" "There  are   five  dependent variables: mi nutes/ day spent in exercise, and  minutes of exercise done :   ( 1)  alone;  ( 2)  with a child;  ( 3)  with a spouse/partner;  ( 4)  with others  (e.g., friends, strangers) .   Minutes of exercise  is the sum of   time spent in  several types of exercise  (e.g., walking, cycling, basketball; see supplementary online table) .  Social   exercise time   is  n ot mutually exclusive;  a respondent could report  exercising  with a child  and  a partner.  These m easures   were  constructed in ATUS-X prior to extraction , and v alues  were  top- coded at the 99 th  percentile."
"31" "Controls include  number of children, age of the youngest child  ( among  those with children) , respondent age, year,  weekend time diary , state-level unemployment rate, race  (white, black, American Indian/Alaskan Native, Asian/Hawaiian Pacific Islander, multiracial) ,  ethnicity  (Hispanic vs. not) , immigrant status, region, metropolitan status, education  (less than high school/GED, high school, some college, college degree) , and marital status.  These  variables  are associated wit h risk of unemployment, and for most there is  evidence of an association  with  exercise . 24-26"
"32" "Observations with poor dat a quality ( determined  by  BLS )   were  dropped (2 , 045 observations). Missing flags  (i.e., dummy variables)   are  used for missing values on the two variables with missing data: state-level unemployment rate (<1% of the sample) and metro politan  status ( approximately  6% of the sample). The  main  analytic samples range from 10,665 to 77,390 depending on  respondent gender  and whether model s   are  restricted to  individuals reporting at least some  exercise ."
"33" "Models  are  estimated  in Stata 13  using ordinary least squares ,  with  survey  analytic  procedures  and replicate weights  because of the complex survey sampling design of the ATUS.  Gender-stratified models are estimated   because research indicates  the relationship between unemployment and exercise  differs  by gender . 28   All respondents  are  included in the model s  of  total exercise  time.  Solitary and social exercise models   are  estimated  for  the sample reporting at least some  exercise .  Models  are   first  estimated for all respondents and then  re-estimated   for partnered respondents ,  with   partner’s unemployment/OOLF status   added   as a predictor.   The  study was exempt from review by the university’s Institutional Review Board."
"34" "Results"
"35" "Descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1.   On average the unemployed appear more disadvantaged than the employed.  Exercise time ranges  widely  across the sample  (0-235 minutes) , with average times  of   approximately  11 minutes/ day for women   and   approximately  21  minutes/ day for unemployed men . More time  is  spent i n activity alone or with others  than with partners or children."
"36" "[Table 1 about here.]"
"37" "Results for the  analysis  are shown in Table 2.  Columns 1 and 2 contain the results for all respondents.  Panel 1 indicate s  that, on average, unemployed  ( B  =  6.85 ,  p  < .001 )  and OOLF  ( B  =  8.02 ,  p  < .001 )  men spend  more time in  exercise  than employed men. This pattern  is  also seen for unemployed and OOLF women,  but  the magnitude of the  coefficients   is  smaller."
"38" "[Table 2 about here.]"
"39" "Results for  models of  time  in  solitary  or social activity  are shown in Panels 2-5 , and include   only  those reporting at least some   exercise .  Unemployed   and OOLF  men sp end  more time in  exercise  alone  ( B  =  8.77 ,  p  < .001;   B  =  3.69 ,  p  =  .03 , respectively )  and with others   ( B  =  13.54 ,  p  < .001 ;  B  =  13.33 ,  p  < .001 , respectively )  compared to  employed men.  Thus, their activity  patterns  are  similar regardless of whether  they  are  unemployed or OOLF."
"40" "Women’s results   differ .  Unemployed women  spend  more time in  exercise  w ith others  ( B  =  6.23 ,  p  =  .011 )   than employed women ,  but  there  are  no  other significant differences .  OOLF women  spend  more time in  exercise  with others   ( B  =  8.88 ,  p  < .001 ) , with children   ( B  =  1.32 ,  p  =  .013 ) , and with partners   ( B  =  2.60 ,  p  < .001 ) , compared to employed women."
"41" "Results  for  partnered individuals  a re shown in  Columns 3 and 4 . Unemployed   and OOLF  men  and women   follow the same pattern as in the full sample.  Active  men  and women  with u nempl oyed/ OOLF partne rs spend  less time in  exercise  alone compared to those with employed  partners   ( B  =  -3.42 ,  p  =  .001 ;   B  = -1.47,  p  = .009 , respectively )   and  more time in  exercise  with the partner   ( B  =  4.20 ,  p  =  .002 ;  B  = 6.77,  p  < .001, respectively ) ."
"42" "Discussion"
"43" "This study  examined social versus solitary exercise patterns with a particular focus on the unemployed and OOLF .  Exercise has many benefits ,  and  s ocial  exercise   could   help  buffer the negative effects of a job loss.  H1  states  that unemployed ,  OOLF , and employed  men spend similar amounts of time in  all types of exercise . U nemployed and OOLF men  spend more time exercising  overall , alone, and with others  compared to  employed men , contrary to  H1 .  These results   conflict with   research that indicated  men  do  not change their  exercise  during unemployment. 28   The  current study  is   cross-sectional,  so  unobserved  time-invariant  characteristics  may explain some of this conflict .   Yet   time diaries   generally   provide improved estimates  compared to retrospective reports .  Although  un employed and OOLF men also spend  more time in  solitary exercise ,  prior research suggests that  men’s frequent engagement in social exercise  may  provide   benefits  that could be leveraged to improve health outcomes."
"44" "H2  states  that unemployed and OOLF women spend more time in  all  types of exercise   compared to employed women.  Compared to employ ed women, unemployed women spend  more time in  exercise  with others , and   OOLF women spend  more time in all types of  social  exercise .   The difference  between unemployed and OOLF women  could  arise  if  unemployed  women  are  reluctant to  significantly change time use  in anticipation of re-employment.  Thus, results   partially support  H2  and  are consistent with research   that  suggests   unemployed  women  might   use  their  “extra”  time to invest in their health through  exercise . 28   Consistent  with men,   results  suggest   it may be   possible   to leverage   social exercise to help  buffer the negative effects of unemployment  and lost  labor market ties ."
"45" "During  a partner’s unemployment/ OOLF both men and women  spend  less time  exercising  alone and more time  exercising  with a partner compared to those with employed partners.  For men, total time in exercise  does  not vary by partner’s unemployed/OOLF status ,  but  women  with non-working partners  exercise  slightly less. This is consistent with recent research 28   and may reflect differential labor market responses  to a partner’s unemployment/ OOLF status.  Men’s partners are more likely to be voluntarily OOLF , and men tend to work full time,  so  they may not  increase  paid labor  time   if their partner  stops working .  Women’s  partners are more likely to be involuntarily unemployed, and women are more likely to  work part time , which may  lead to increased  labor force participation  during  a partner’s unemployment /OOLF ,  taking  time  from  other activities."
"46" "Women’s  (and men’s)  greater  exercise time  with the partner  during the partner’s unemployment/OOLF   may reflect  their  role in providing social support.  Shared  exercise  might provide  a means of  social support during a stressful period.  If  exercising together is a form of social support for  partners,   these patterns  could  benefit  the unemployed/ OOLF partner and the household  by reducing stress and strain. 27"
"47" "This study has limitations .   Only   one  household  respondent  reported  their time use ,  so  dyadic analyses are not possible .  Multiple   forms  of  exercise  were  combined to facilitate comparisons;  examining  specific activities might be instructive, especially  activities  that facilitate soci al interaction (e.g., team  sports 19 ) .  Finally, this  study is descriptive ,  and  unobserved factors could  drive   employment status differences . Nonetheless, the results provide an important starting point for future research  and new information about the social nature of exercise ."
"48" "Future research might examine dyadic aspects in more detail with new data sets or by creatively leveraging existing data to  learn more about the benefits and  consequences of  different   exercise patterns across employment status es . U nderstanding these exercise patterns may prove useful for researchers and health professionals interested in designing interventions to improve population health.   Interventions  might  aim to reduce  the negative health effects of unemployment ,   helping to  buffer the stress and  lost  social ties that accompany job loss ,  thereby   mitigating  negative  societal  consequences of widespread or poorly  managed  unemployment ."
