ABSTRACT
With the rapid development of technology, incorporation of Information Communication
Technology (ICT) for formative assessment purpose has been increasing over the past
decade. This article describes the design and development of identification of students'
misconceptions in an individualized learning environment (iSMILE) system that includes
accommodations for students’ misconceptions in order to improve student’s conceptual
understanding and finally learning outcome. The assessment process is carried out by
preparing two-level multiple-choice questions. Misconceptions are identified for each
instructional objective to make a root question and linked questions. Depending on the
answers provided by the student in first level, the linked questions are given to get more
information regarding the misconception. Based on the first and second level answers of
students, feedbacks are provided with the misconception identified. One of the most
important differences of our iSMILE system, with respect to the other developed systems,
is the inclusion of misconception based feedback. The iSMILE system has been developed
by using open source ICT tools (like MySQL, Apache, etc.) which make the system free of
cost and accessible and editable by any instructor from anywhere and at any time.

INTRODUCTION
In general, assessment plays an important role in any educational system. It identifies, collects
and interprets information about the learner’s conceptual understanding associated with
instructional objectives (Farrell & Rushby, 2016; Rodrigues & Oliveira, 2014). Formative
assessment is an integral part of assessment, which is an ongoing process of gathering data to
measure the degree of attainment of course goals (Hsu, Chou, & Chang, 2011). Chin and Teou
(2009, p. 1309) define formative assessment as “assessment that informs teachers about what
students have learnt, indicates what students may be finding difficult, and helps teachers to
adjust their teaching to maximize students’ learning.” Formative assessment is a central
element of learning environment of the 21st century to improve students’ learning
effectiveness (Bell & Cowie, 2001; Black & Wiliam, 1998; Redecker & Johannessen, 2013). Fuchs
and Fuchs (1986) conducted a meta-analysis to examine the effect of formative evaluation on
students’ learning achievement. They found an overall effect size of 0.70, which is moderate.
The main purpose of formative assessment is to provide meaningful feedback to teachers
and students. Students can monitor their learning progress using the feedbacks (Bell & Cowie,
2001). Effective feedback can help to identify learner’s specific errors or misconceptions related
with the concept (Attali, 2015; Shute, 2008), improve learning and performance (Attali, 2015;
Hattie & Timperley, 2007; Lefevre & Cox, 2016; Sadler, 1989; Yuan & Kim, 2015), increase
learner’s confidence and motivation to learn (Yuan & Kim, 2015). With the introduction of
technology, the effectiveness of feedback delivery can be improved with more accuracy
(Pacheco-Venegas, López, & Andrade-Aréchiga, 2015). Technology can help the assessment
process to collect, and analyze the data in a shorter period of time with more accuracy (Farrell
& Rushby, 2016; Redecker & Johannessen, 2013; Yuan & Kim, 2015).
Currently, many researchers have developed web-based/computer-based assessment
systems and found the potential benefit in improving the learning effectiveness of the learners

(Crisp & Ward, 2008; Hsu et al., 2011; Landauer, Lochbaum, & Dooley, 2009; Pacheco-Venegas
et al., 2015; Rodrigues & Oliveira, 2014; Wang, 2008, 2010). Crisp and Ward (2008) developed
Pedagogical Psychology Computer Assisted Assessment (PePCAA) system to facilitate
understanding of pedagogical psychology. They found that PePCAA system motivated the
students and provided deeper learning. Hsu et al. (2011) developed Edu-miner system by
utilizing a series of text mining techniques to evaluate learner’s performance. Landauer et al.
(2009) developed Write-ToLearn formative assessment tool to monitor progress in reading and
writing. Pacheco-Venegas et al. (2015) developed MathDIP to provide automatic evaluation
and feedback during problem solving in mathematics. Rodrigues and Oliveira (2014)
developed AssiStudy as a formative assessment tool to monitor students’ learning progress.
Wang (2010) developed graduated prompting assessment module of the WATA (GPAMWATA) to provide timely feedback while facing difficulties when attempting test items.
From the above, we have found that there is no available system, which provides
misconception based feedbacks. To fill this research gap, we have developed iSMILE system.
This paper has outlined the iSMILE system, its components and architecture, working process,
and application.

COMPONENTS AND ARCHITECTURE OF ISMILE SYSTEM
The iSMILE system is composed of a database unit, a server unit, and a user interface, as
shown in Fig. 1. In our system, MySQL and Apache Server are preferred as a database unit
and a server unit respectively. PHP is used as a server-side language in order to design and
code the user interface. We have used only open-source tools in our system. In an open-source
system, the source code is available to all. Therefore, anyone can alter the code (to customize
the software according to their needs), fix software-bugs and enhance security considerations.
Thus, instructors with minimal software knowledge can also add new features and write new
modules.

iSMILE’s architecture is based on the Model View Controller (MVC) design. According
to the MVC design structure, the command-flow is initiated by a central controller. Upon
initiation, the controller sends requests to a compatible handler application. The end user
interacts with the intranet interface through this central controller. Controller handles all the
inputs to the MVC model. For instance, a Graphical User Interface (GUI) controller accepts
GUI inputs from the user and gives appropriate commands to the Model and View. Thus,
command-actions based on respective inputs are executed. In case of an invalid-input is being
given to the controller; the Model sends a command back to the controller to communicate
through the View. Subsequently, the View layout displays a message through GUI like ‘inputerror’ and ‘try again’. The MVC design is illustrated in Fig. 2.

The three components of iSMILE system architecture are described as below
Database Unit
MySQL is used as the database unit. A database design of a database system is an
important stage in system development. In design phase, the database construction is coded
in any formal language supported by the database management system. A database design
diagram is used to show how the data is organized by forming various database tables. The
database design diagram is shown as Fig. 3.

Fig. 3. iSMILE’s Database Design Diagram.

Another design tool is the Data Flow Diagram (DFD). It is a graphical representation of
the flow data. That is, how the data moves from the external data source or internal data
storage to an external system or to an internal system. It is quite different from the Flow chart
where one can determine the rate, order and circumstances of occurrence of a work but
without any data input and output information, which is possible in case of DFD. iSMILE’s
DFD is shown in Fig. 4.

Server Unit
Apache HTTP web server software is used as a server unit in the iSMILE. We preferred
Apache because it is free to download and is open-source. Hence, due to its open-source nature
and add-ons support, anyone can adapt the Apache server for specific needs. In order to
perform the HTTP server operations, Apache needs some other tools. Additional software
tools required in the server side are:
a) Server-side programming language: PHP
b) Database tool: MySQL
c) Compatible operating system: Windows/Linux
d) Web browser supporting JavaScript: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, etc.

User Interface
The user interface mainly has three stages.
Login: There is a quality login window which can be used by both instructors as well as
students, as shown in Fig. 5. If the login credentials are valid, the user will be redirected to
respective dashboard screen.

Fig. 5. Login screen of iSMILE system.

Assessment: Assessment page is the most important page in our system, as shown in
Fig. 6. It consists of two parts namely:
(a) Assessment selection: From the given choices the student can select the assessment for
taking on with the test.
(b) Appearing for the test: Here the user can answer the questions. There is also an option to
skip the question. If the user has answered the first-level question, the second-level
question will be provided to the user based on the selection. For each option (choice) in the
first-level question will have exactly one second level question.

Feedback: The student will be provided with detailed feedback upon completion of the
assessment. The feedback includes the questions attended, and the answers provided by the
user. There will be separate section for feedback on each question. The feedback will be stored
in the application, and the user can view it at any time, as shown in Fig. 7.

WORKING PROCESS OF THE ISMILE SYSTEM
The login page of iSMILE user interface can be accessed in any web browser with a local
address (e.g. http://localhost/iit/), and the option for sign-in is provided. In the first step, if
the user has not registered, then he/she can register with ‘create account’ option. For
registering a new instructor by assigning a user’s email id and password, one has to get the
administrative privileges. Thus, through manual editing in server computer, new instructor
login is created. In the second step, after opening http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ , the system
administrator can add as many instructors as required. In the third step, user has to finish the
registration process, and iSMILE system will identify the student or instructor, based on the
sign-in credentials they are given. We have created two different types of registration to ensure
security.
When the instructor logs in the system, the application of the iSMILE provides the links
(e.g., topics, questions and question-sets). If there are no question sets previously entered or if
the instructor wants to create new question sets, he/she can use ‘create topics’, ‘create
question-sets’ and ‘create question’ options to enter two-level objective questions on various
topics. Each question will have two meta-data fields: instructional objective and
misconception. After entering the second-level question based on the misconception, the
instructor has to enter feedbacks for each possible option. The idea behind the feedback is to
pinpoint the misconception. In the final step, entering all questions and feedbacks in a
question-set, it has to be published by using the ‘publish’ button. All unpublished questions
are visible to the instructor only and can be edited at any time before publishing.
When a student logs in, all the available (published) question-sets are displayed to the
student. He/she can attend the assessment and can view the feedback immediately. There is
a provision to skip a question also. This is to avoid random guessing. The feedbacks are stored
in the system for the students, and they can view previous feedbacks at any later login. The
flow charts for student’s registration, login and assessment are shown in Fig. 8, Fig. 9, and Fig.
10 respectively. The working process is further illustrated using a model set of questions from
the course of Digital System Design.

CONCLUSION
To make the formative assessment more effective, this work presents iSMILE system,
which is based on students’ misconceptions. This paper describes the design and features of
iSMILE system and how it is better than the existing web-based formative evaluation tools.
For every instructional objective, a root (first level) and four linked (second level) multiplechoice questions are prepared with respect to the identified misconceptions. At least one
misconception is included in every instructional objective as a metadata field and based on
this a two-level diagnostic test is carried out. Thus, based on the answers provided by the
student to the first-level questions and second level questions, feedback is given to improve
the learning skills of the student. In addition, feedback highlights the misconceptions
associated with students’ conceptual understanding. This feature of iSMILE distinguishes

itself from other available web-based formative assessment systems. Our system uses the
open-source ICT tools (like MySQL, Apache); therefore, it is free of cost and can be accessed
from anywhere and at any time. Our system has not yet been evaluated inside real classroom
settings, which is a limitation of our work. For future research, we are planning to incorporate
the iSMILE system into formal classroom settings, in order to evaluate the learning
effectiveness of this software.
