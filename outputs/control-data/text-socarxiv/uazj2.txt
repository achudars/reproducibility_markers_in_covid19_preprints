FOOD SECURITY AND LOW-INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN THE
MALAYSIAN EAST COAST ECONOMIC REGION: AN EMPIRICAL
ANALYSIS
Abstract
This research aims at analyzing the level of food security among some selected poor and lowincome households in Malaysia. The study area is located in the East Coast Economic Region
of the country. It uses primary data collected during the July-October months of 2012 and
460 sample families were chosen from the E-Kasih poor households database based on
cluster random sampling technique. In this sample survey, households’ food security has been
measured by the USAID-HFIA model. The findings of the study indicate that 52.8% of the
households are food secure, that of 23.3% are mildly food insecure, 14.3% are moderately
food insecure, and 9.6% are severely food insecure. The findings on the current situation of
household food security among different economic groups is very important for the policy
makers to achieve Vision 2020 and the targets of Malaysian National Plans regarding food
security, socioeconomic development and poverty alleviation. In order to ensure food
security in Malaysia, especial focuses are needed for those who are severely food insecured
and those who are food insecured but marginally above the poverty line. Here the
involvement of private sector and community based organizations are also important to
combat the short run, seasonal, and event related risk of food insecurity as well as for the
development of appropriate mitigation and adaptation options to ensure sustainable food
security at household level in Malaysia.

Introduction
It is widely held that the global food crisis of 2008 was not only a problem for that time, but
also a sign of a deeper and wider challenge for the world in the subsequent years. According
to experts, it is time to make serious preparations to meet this crisis that may revisit the world
in the near future. Thus, food security is a burning issue and of great concern for many
nations on the face of the earth.
At national level, the adequacy of domestic food production or capability to mobilize
food on time from international market may be sufficient. However, it does not automatically
guarantee sustained food security at household level. The factors determining food security at
household level are more crucial than those at national level. When “food security” is defined
as access by all people at all times to the food needed for a healthy life (FAO 2003:28), the
focus of “food security” is on households as basic units of society. This assertion is
important, as strategies directed toward improving food security for households may be quite
different from those aimed at ensuring the same for the country as a whole.
Food security at household level is considered so important now that developed
countries are also putting more emphasis on this issue. For example, it was found that 16.9%
of the population in the US was at risk of household food insecurity during the duration of the
five year period, and 14.5% of the households faced food insecurity at some point in 2010
2

(Parke et al. 2010). If it was the scenario of a developed nation, it was also very important to
find out the scenario for the developing world. As a case study, therefore, this study looks at
the status of Malaysia. The focus on Malaysia is justified for several reasons. Among the
developing nation, Malaysia is one of the emerging economies which has successfully
developed a policy of enviable economic growth and also planned to become a fully
developed nation by the year of 2020, which is known as the Vision 2020 of Malaysia.
Malaysia joined 185 other nations in signing the Declaration of Rome at the 1996
International Food Summit, pledging to reduce the prevalence of hunger by at least 50%,
within its own jurisdiction, by a target date some time in the early 21st century. However, in
Malaysia, the food security has been embedded into the theme of self-sufficiency level that
referred to paddy or rice sector only (Alam et al. 2011; 2012a), instead of having a specific or
special policy on overall food security. To ensure food security in Malaysia, the government
adopts two strategies, such as establishing self-sufficiency level and building rice stocks both
domestically and internationally. However, Malaysia has had never met the food selfsufficiency level. About 10% to 35% of total required rice is imported from neighboring
countries, such as Thailand, Vietnam, Myanmar, India, and Pakistan. The highest food selfsufficiency level for the country was 95% and the lowest was 65%, which were recorded in
1975 and 1990 respectively.
Regarding the status of food security in in Malaysia, studies have shown that among
low-income rural communities, 50% or more of the households face some level of food
insecurity with 34.5% child hunger (Shariff and Khor 2008). They also show that households
with food insecurity have been characterized by more children, larger size families, more
school-going kids, and mothers who happen to be housewives only. In comparison to the
food secure households, more of the households with food insecurity have been living below
poverty line (59.5%) with 7.8% being classified as households that are hard-core poor. The
percentage of households with food insecurity in Malaysia is higher in urban low-income
households, such as 66.6% (Zalilah 1998) and 65.7% (Zalilah and Ang 2001) compared to
rural low-income households 58% (Shariff and Khor 2008). Nevertheless, the quantity of
urban low-income households facing child hunger (27.8% and 27.1%) are lower compared to
rural households (34.5%).
Therefore, to achieve Vision 2020 and the targets of Malaysian National Plans
regarding food security, socioeconomic development and poverty alleviation at the grass-root
level, it is very important to study the current situation of household food security among
different economic groups. This study is an attempt to measure and analyze the level of
household food insecurity of some selected households of the low income people in the East
Coast Economic Region of the country.
Data, Model, and Methodology
Measurement of the Household Food Security
There are several ways to measure household food security condition, such as individual food
intake (dietary intake), household calorie acquisition, dietary diversity, and indices of
household coping strategies. Household food security also can be assessed using direct and
indirect measurements. Food Sufficiency Status Question (Briefel et al. 1992), Community
Childhood Hunger Identification Project Instrument (Wehler et al. 1994), Radimer/Cornell
Hunger and Food Insecurity Instrument (Radimer et al. 1992), Cumulative Food Security
3

Index (Maxwell 1996), Food Security Core Model (Bickel et al. 2000), and Household Food
Insecurity Access Scale (Coates et al. 2007) are among questionnaire-based techniques
designed to directly measure core behaviors and experiences related to food sufficiency or
access or food insecurity. These techniques and measurements have been applied by the
person most responsible for food and food provision in households. The indirect measures of
food insecurity are utilization of food security-related programs, income-based measurements
of poverty, anthropometric measures, financial hardship indicators, dietary intake and other
nutrition and health parameters. They reveal the vulnerability level in which food insecurity
may be deduced reasonably (Radimer et al. 1990; Office of Nutrition Policy and Promotion at
Health Canada 2002). This study measures household food security by directly using the
questionnaire-based techniques developed by Coates et al. (2007) for USAID.
USAID’s Food and Nutrition Technical Assistance (FANTA) project has supported a
series of research initiatives. These initiatives are to explore and test different options for
meeting the need for relatively simple, but methodologically rigorous indicators of the access
component of household food insecurity for the USAID Title II, Child Survival, and Health
Grant programs. Finally they have developed the method of measuring Household Food
Insecurity Access (HFIA) Related Condition. This is based on the idea that the experience of
food insecurity (access) cause predictable reactions and responses that can be captured,
quantified, and summarized through a survey on a scale based on the following nine
questions.
Q1
Q2
Q3
Q4
Q5
Q6
Q7
Q8
Q9

Did you have sufficient food for your family in the last four weeks?
Were you able to eat the food you prefer in the last four weeks?
Could you afford some variety of food items for your family without a single
monotonous item in the last four weeks?
Did you have to eat some kind of food that you did not want to in the last four
weeks?
Did all of your family members had enough food for themselves in the last
four weeks?
Did any of your family members had to skip a meal in any day due to food
shortage in the last four weeks?
For any day, did you have any situation where there was no food for anybody
in the family in the last four weeks?
Did any member of your family had to go to bed without eating dinner in the
last four weeks?
Did any of your family members passed a whole day (24 hours) with no food
at all in the last four weeks?

The intensities of the occurrence of these 9 questions are also measured in three
frequencies – rarely (1-2 times per month) or sometimes (3-10 times) or often (10+ times per
month) – which indicate by Q1a to Q9a. Based on the answers of these nine queries,
Household Food Insecurity Access (HFIA) Prevalence is calculated for each household by
assigning a code ranging from 1 to 4, where 1=Food Secure, 2=Mildly Food Insecure Access,
3=Moderately Food Insecure Access, 4=Severely Food Insecure Access. The four food
security categories are created sequentially, in the same order as shown Equations 1 through
4, to ensure that every household are placed in a single, unique category and is classified
according to their most severe response. The measurements of the categories are as follows:


Category = 1 if [(Q1=0 or Q1=1) and Q2=0 and Q3=0 and Q4=0

Q3a=1 or Q4a=1) and Q5=0 and Q6=0 and Q7=0 and
Q8=0 and Q9=0]
Category = 3 if [(Q3a=2 or Q3a=3 or Q4a=2 or Q4a=3 or Q5a=1 or
Q5a=2 or Q6a=1 or Q6a=2) and Q7=0 and Q8=0
and Q9=0]
Category = 4 if [Q5a=3 or Q6a=3 or Q7a=1 or Q7a=2 or Q7a=3 or
Q8a=1 or Q8a=2 or Q8a=3 or Q9a=1 or Q9a=2 or
Q9a=3]

Further, the findings of the nine indicators of Household Food Insecurity Access
(HFIA) are categorized into three domains, which are measured by the following domains:





Anxiety and uncertainty domain is measured when households respond “yes” to Q1.
Insufficient food quality domain is measured when households respond “yes” to Q2 or
Q3 or Q4.
Insufficient food intake and its physical consequences domain are measured when
households respond “yes” to Q5 or Q6 or Q7 or Q8 or Q9.

Further, this study measures the HFIA Scale Score which is considered as a
continuous measure of the degree of food insecurity (access) in households. HFIA Scale
Score is calculated by providing value for each household. The frequency of occurring value
are given as 1,2,3 and the value for relevant question was put as 0 if the answer is “No”, such
as if Q1=0 then Q1a=0, if Q2=0 then Q2a =0, etc. Therefore, the range of minimum to
maximum score for a household is 0-27. The higher the score is, the higher the level of food
insecurity (access) is, and the lower the score is, the lesser the level of food insecurity
(access) is.
Finally, this study also analyzes the distribution of HFIA Prevalence in Malaysia based
on location and poverty levels.
Statistical Analysis
To check the robustness of the results, several statistical tests have been carried out. Whether
there is any statistically significant difference among the frequency of the four categories of
households, this study also conducts a Single Sample Chi Square Test on HFIA Prevalence.
Further to verify the validity of the HFIA Prevalence, this study carries out RASCH
Measurement Model. The RASCH measurement model is used by the US Department of
Agriculture (USDA) to measure the household food security (Bickel et al. 2000). The
RASCH measurement model assumes an underlying continuum (for this study, the severity
of food insecurity experienced by the household) upon which both items and households can
be located, and assumes that the probability of a household affirming a specific item depends
on the relative severity of the household and the item. The RASCH model assumes
specifically that the log of the odds of a household affirming an item is proportional to the
difference between the severity level of the household and the severity level of the item.
Here, a household that has not experienced any of the conditions of food insecurity covered
by the survey questions, is assigned a scale value of 0, while a household that has
experienced all of them has a scale value of 9.

To check the sensitivity, this study employs Monte Carlo (MC) simulation on the
HFIA Scale Score. Generally, it is impossible to find out the actual value but based on past
experiences or experts in this field, or historical data, it is possible to estimate a figure.
Although the estimate is derived from the field survey sample data, it has several inherent
risk and uncertainty as it is an estimated value of an unknown population. MC simulation
technique is utilized to show how the sample data vary from real life’s uncertain situations.
This technique offers the decision-maker with many possible results from the most
conservative viewpoint to the most liberal viewpoint and the possibilities that it will take
place given a method of action. It has several advantages over the “single-point estimate” or
deterministic analysis. MC technique is a stochastic method using random numbers having
different values with corresponding probabilities to examine the issues in question. The MC
simulation analyses by designing models with potential outcomes by replacing a set of values
from the distribution of the probability input. Then, it measures the results repeatedly, every
time with a different group of random values from the probable inputs. MC simulation can
provide thousands of possibilities before it is done dependently on specified ranges and
numbers of uncertainties. If a model is done according to estimated ranges, the model’s
output will also be in a range. Based on this, the MC simulation offers a more comprehensive
observation of what might occur by producing possible outcome values of the distributions. It
not only reveals what can take place, but also the possibility that what may occur. The MC
simulation’s accuracy is a function of the quantity of trails which means the results’
confidence bounds can be computed readily according to the quantity of trails.
To see if there is any statistically significant difference among area, location, and
poverty level based on the frequency of the four categories of household food security, this
study uses the Tukey's HSD (honest significant difference) Test as well as the Scheffé's
method. Tukey method is preferable when considers pairwise comparisons, and Scheffé
method is preferable when many or all contrasts are taken into consideration. Scheffé's
method is generally too conservative to produce experimental error rate to be smaller than α.
Data Collection
For the empirical assessment, this study mostly relies on primary data that have been
collected through an extensive questionnaire survey at household level in the East Coast
Economic Region (ECER) in Malaysia. ECER is more than half of the Peninsular Malaysia
with an area of about 66,000 square kilometers that covers the states of Kelantan,
Terengganu, Pahang, and the district of Mersing in Johor. ECER is very crucial for two major
reasons (Alam et al. 2012b): (a) it is the most vulnerable area in Malaysia due to climate
changes and (b) the income level of this region is low and poverty rate is high, which is a
hindrance to achieving Vision 2020 in Malaysia.
This study collected primary data from 460 households from the urban and rural areas
of ECER. The urban area of Kuantan and rural area of Pekan were selected from the Pahang
state. The urban area of Kota Bharu and rural area of Tumpat were selected from the
Kelantan state. The urban area of Kuala Terengganu and rural area of Marang were chosen
from the Terengganu state. A questionnaire guide technique was used to collect data. The
survey was conducted by the regular remunerators of the Implementation Coordination Unit
(ICU) agency in the months of July-October, 2012. The samples were taken from the E-Kasih
poor household database. E-Kasih system is an integrated database system that enlists poor
households at national level to plan, implement, and monitor poverty programs in Malaysia.

The study followed the cluster random sampling technique. Initially, the samples were
clustered by location and then by poverty category. Finally, from each category, samples
were picked randomly. Based on the formula of required size of samples (Yamane 1967:
886), first, a sample of 400 households were selected according to the proportion of
population distribution. However, to ensure a good number of observations for each group,
which was needed for sound statistical analysis for any particular group, another 100
households were added to the list. However, while targeting 500, after collecting and
validating the data, finally, 460 households were considered for the study. The final
distribution of the collected sample is given in the Table 1.

Analysis and Discussions
Household Food Availability
Beyond the measurement of household food security according to the USAID’s measurement
of HFIA, initially this study asked households about their food status in five categories (Table
2). Only 14.8% said that they had enough of the food that they would like, but majority
(41.1%) of the households mentioned that they never had enough of the kind of food they
would need. Only 9.1% of the households mentioned that they frequently stayed hungry. This
measurement was based on the direct perception of the household, where USAID’s
measurement of HFIA were based on the frequency calculation.

Household Food Insecurity Access Related Condition
The nine indicators provide specific and disaggregated information about the behaviors and
perceptions of the surveyed households (Table 3). Percentile analysis of these indicators
measures household condition at any level of severity. By considering personal experiences
with uncertainty and anxiety about acquiring food during the previous month, 69.8%
households are somehow worried about food. Among them, 33.3% are often worried about
food. In the survey area, among the households, 52.8% mentioned that they never face the
problem having access to the kind of food they would prefer, whereas 29.3% have often been
unable to eat their preferred food.
While asking about dietary choices related to variety, 60% of the households mention
that they never have to eat an undesired monotonous diet like little diversity in the different
types of foods consumed, but 17% often eat just a few kinds of food. Further looking at the
dimension of limited choices, 32.8% households mention that they have to eat food that they
find socially or personally undesirable due to a lack of resources.

While asking about eating smaller amount of food due to lack of resources, 17%
households say, “yes”, and 9.1% of them suffer from it often. However, 12.5% skip a regular
meal due to lack of food, and 7.8% of them do it often.
Only 9.1% of the households face the situation where the households have no food of
any kind to eat because in this situation, food is not available to household members through
the usual means (e.g. through purchase, from the garden or field, from storage, etc.), and the
frequency for 6.3% of them, it happens sometimes in a month. Moreover, 5.4% of them also
go to sleep hungry 1-2 times in a month, and 3% of them do not eat from the time they awake
in the morning to the time they awake the next morning due to lack of food.
Household Food Insecurity Access Prevalence
Based on the HFIA prevalence, households can be categorized into four levels of food
insecurity (access). If households response more affirmatively, they are categorized as
8

increasingly food insecure. Table 4 illustrates the categorizations, where every household is
placed in a single unique category based on the set of responses.

In Table 5, the four categories of household food security are created sequentially
based on Equations 1-4 and as illustrated in Table 4. Based on the survey, this study finds
52.8% of the households are under the category of “food secure.” These households
experience none of the food insecurity (access) conditions or just rarely experience worry.
Among the surveyed households, 23.3% face mild food insecurity (access) who are worried
about not having enough food sometimes or often, and/or unable to eat preferred food, and/or
rarely eat a more monotonous diet than desired and/or also rarely eat some undesirable food.

Among the households, 14.3% are moderately food insecure. These households
frequently sacrifice quality of food by eating a monotonous diet or undesirable food
sometimes or often, and/or rarely or sometimes reduce eating the quantity of food. There are
9.6% of households that are severely food insecure who have had to often cut back on their
meal size or frequency of meals, and/or have experienced any of the three most severe
conditions such as going to bed hungry, running out of food infrequently, rarely or at least
once in the past month not eating the whole day and night.
The value of Single Sample Chi-square test is 207.7. The Chi-square test shows that
the frequencies of the four categories are significantly different at 1% level. It indicates that
the number of food secure households significantly differs from other food insecure
households.
To check the validity of the four categories of household food security that are
measured by the logical indications given by USAID, this study uses the RASCH
measurement model. Here, the household which has faced any of the food insecurity
conditions provided in the survey questionnaire is given the scale value of 0, whereas a
household which has faced all of the food insecurity conditions is given the scale value of 9.
According to the related severity of the household and the items, the household food security
categories are given in Table 6.

*Item measured by using RASCH WINSTEP software

The RASCH model also statistically groups data into four categories, but the number
of households for each category differs from the USAID’s measurement of HFIA (Table 6).
RASCH shows more households in two extreme categories and less in the two middle
categories. RASCH categorizes 58.3% households as food secure and 16.9% as severely food
10

insecure. USAID’s measurement of HFIA logically categorizes the indicators in a similar
group by looking at the frequency of the occurrence, whereas RASCH categorizes the
indicators in a similar group based on the probability of data homogeneity. Thus, USAID’s
measurement of HFIA is theoretically more preferable, and this study considers the findings
of USAID’s measurement of HFIA.
Household Food Insecurity Access Related Domains
The findings of the nine indicators of Household Food Insecurity Access (HFIA) are
categorized as three domains. Among them, 69.8% of the households are found under this
anxiety and uncertainty domain, 47.2% of them are under insufficient food quality domain,
and 17% of the households are under insufficient food intake and its physical consequences
domain.

Household Food Insecurity Access Scale Score
The total HFIA Scale Score is 5.18 from the surveyed households, which indicates an overall
lower level of food insecurity (access) of a household. To check the sensitivity of the data,
this study performs 10,000 trails for Monte Carlo simulation for the HFIA Scale Score. Since
the data range is positive (0-27), it ran one tailed simulation only. The simulation assumes
normal distribution of data and finds mean 6.82 and standard deviation is 4.88, whereas the
actual sample mean is 5.18 and standard deviation is 6.46. The skewness value for simulation
model is 0.8 (Figure 2) whereas for the sample is 1.3 (Figure 3) which indicates both are
positively skewed.

Based on one tailed analysis, the simulated value of the score can optimally reach the
maximum value of 26.98 and minimum value of 0.0003. There are around 50% chances that
the mean value would be 6.82, and at 95% confidence level, the mean interval will be
between 6.72 and 6.91. However, there is a 10% chance that the value would be up to 1.14 as
well as more than 13.80. There is a 25% chance that the value would be up to 2.94 as well as
more than 10 (Table 7).

Locational Distribution of Household Food Security
According to the statistical test of Tukey's HSD and Scheffé, there is no significant difference
available in the level of household food security due to the urban or rural area or state wise
locational differences among the three states of Malaysia. However, the percentile analysis
shows urban area is more food secure than the rural area. In the urban area, food security is
56.2% of the households and in rural area it is 50.5% (Table 8). Urban area is more food
secure in Kelantan and Terengganu but in Pahang there is no difference between urban and
rural areas. Among the states, the urban area of Kelantan is more food secure compared to
Pahang and Terengganu, but the rural area of Pahang is more food secure compared to
Kelantan and Terengganu. The rural areas are also more severely food insecure compared to
urban areas. Among the rural areas, Terengganu is more severely food insecure compared to
Pahang and Kelantan.

Poverty Status and Household Food Security
There are interesting relationships between poverty status and food security status of
households (Table 9). According to the statistical test of Tukey's HSD and Scheffé, there are
significant differences available in the level of household food security due to the poverty
status of the households. This is found only for the marginally non-poor group, who
significantly differs with all other categories. Interestingly, the level of household food
security of recently marginally non-poor group does not statistically significantly differ with
other poor groups except the marginally non-poor group.
Among the hard core poor, 38% are food secure but among the non-poor, 36-38%
households are not food secure. The normal poor are more mildly food insecure than the nonpoor, even more than the hard core poor. The hard core poor suffers from food insecurity
more moderately and severely compared to the poor and non-poor. Among the non-poor, 2%
of recently out of poverty households suffer more food insecurity moderately compared to the
existing non-poor. Among all of the non-poor households, 4% are still suffering severely
from food insecurity.

Conclusions and Recommendations
In case of Malaysia, the phrase “food security” still carries the meaning as “food availability”
and that mostly indicates for the crop of rice. As a result, government strategies largely fail to
serve the intended objective of lowering the households’ food insecurity. To achieve Vision
2020 and food security at grass-roots level, here the issue needs to be understood based not
only on who are food insecure at present and why so are they, but also on who might become
food insecure in the future and why this would happen to them.
Therefore, this study measures the status of household food security in Malaysia. It
finds that the majority of the households belonging to the poor and hard core poor groups are
food insecure. But more than one third of the households in the non-poor low income group
are also food insecure. The whole ECER area has the similar nature of food security level that
ranges from 52% to 54%. On the whole, 52.8% of households are fully food secure (access),
but 23.3% of households are facing some amount of food insecurity, 14.3% face moderate
food insecurity, and 9.6% are severely food insecure.
Government is a major player who should play a key role in controlling the threats of
food insecurity via budgets, policies, and by having a legislative guideline for efforts on
adaptation by other interested parties. The government of Malaysia is already working to
eradicate poverty, but here, more attention is deserved by those who are food insecured, but
not under the poverty line. These people are marginally out of poverty but still vulnerable for
food insecurity. At the same time, special care is essential for those who are severely food
insecured. Moreover, finding out the reasons of household food security is also very
important for developing appropriate mitigation and adaptation options. There are several
socioeconomic as well as natural, environmental, and ecological factors that are also
responsible for the food insecurity. As there has been no massive long-term food insecurity in
Malaysia at macro level, most of the food insecurity happens at household level due to the
seasonal or short term events like floods, droughts, etc. Therefore, involvements of other nongovernmental organizations, international agencies, and similar stakeholders are also
important for the sustainable household food security.
Community-based organizations (CBOs) in risk management, particularly in the
emergency times, are well acknowledged and linked to the entire food security process.
Relying on the social capital, CBOs can help poor and low-income Malaysian households in
controlling and coping with risks as well as preventing risks, such as co-sponsoring of local
plans for infrastructure development. Private sector can ensure availability of food during the
times of shortfall in production, and availability of inputs from agriculture as well as provide
credit against labor, harvests, etc. Banks and insurance organizations can offer different
savings, credit facilities, and insurance schemes to seasonally food insecure groups.
