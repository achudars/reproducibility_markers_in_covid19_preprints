DYNAMICS OF TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, ENERGY CONSUMPTION,
ENERGY PRICE AND ECONOMIC GROWTH IN DENMARK
ABSTRACT
This study investigates the dynamic relationships between technological innovation,
consumption of energy, energy price and economic growth in Denmark during the period
from 1970 until 2012, using multivariate setting to examine time-series data. The analysis
employs the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to co-integration in order to
examine both the short and long run dynamics among the variables. Furthermore, the study
uses the Granger procedure within the VAR framework to identify causality among the
variables. The model used in this study is found to be sound, a diagnosis of the reliability of
the model reached by testing normality, functional form, serial correlation, and
heteroscedasticity, with stability of the model tested using a cumulative sum and cumulative
sum square test, based on recursive regression residuals. The ARDL approach to cointegration reveals that real GDP growth positively influences energy consumption as well as
significantly in both the short run and long run, while energy prices and technological
innovation influence energy consumption negatively and significantly. The results ascertain
that energy consumption and economic growth are independent of each other, and thus they
support a neutral hypothesis for Denmark. Besides, both the technological innovation and
energy prices are found to be Granger cause energy consumption. Therefore, the study
suggests that Denmark should adopt conservative energy policy using technological
innovation and energy prices as instruments to achieve energy security and protect the
environment from pollution.

INTRODUCTION
Energy consumption and economic growth are variables which are usually considered to be
highly correlated. Energy is considered a basic input in the production, which in turn
contributes to economic growth. A continuous energy supply is required to maintain and
improve the current levels of production, and any shortfall in energy will negatively affect
economic growth. But high energy consumption is responsible for the emissions of
greenhouse gas (GHG), with subsequent effects on global warming as part of climate change.
Protection from global warming and climate change requires protective measures to isolate
carbon emission from energy consumption by replacing energy extracted from fossil fuels
with energy drawn from renewable sources. Since developed countries are most responsible
for carbon emissions, they need to comply with Kyoto protocol in energy consumption. A
few developed countries including Denmark have taken initiatives to reduce dependency on
fossil fuel energy consumption as it is primarily responsible for carbon emission. Some
emerging economies such as Hungary, Russia and South Africa are voluntarily adopting
similar strategies to reduce their dependency on fossil fuels. If the causality of economic
growth is seen as coming from energy consumption, a reduction in energy consumption may
cause an energy crisis with a spillover effect on production and employment. Yet if causality
is seen running the opposite way, it may be possible to implement a conservative policy to
reduce energy consumption without causing economic harm. It follows that an informed
policy requires a determination of how energy consumption relates to economic growth.
Following the pioneering contribution by Kraft and Kraft [1], plentiful studies have
been conducted focusing on both the developing and the developed countries to examine the
nexus between energy consumption and economic growth. The results from those studies
could be broadly categorized in four groups, however on closer inspection, they are mixed.
One group of studies ([2], [3]. [4], [5], [6]) examined the causal relationship between energy
consumption and economic growth. These studies determine that a dependency on energy for
economic growth, indicating the sensitivity of economic growth on a crisis in energy supply.
They also argue that energy serves as a key ingredient in production and thus affects
economic growth, both directly and indirectly. Therefore the claim by the hypothesis of
energy-growth is that a conservative energy policy may be detrimental to energy
consumption as well as economic growth. A second grouping of studies ([7], [8], [9], [10],
[11], [12], [13], [14])) found an unidirectional causality [15] relationship between economic
growth and energy consumption, which supported the conservative hypothesis. This
hypothesis is contrasting to the growth hypothesis, which implies that conservative energy
policy does not harm economic growth. Subsequently, a third group of studies ([16], [17],
[18], [19], [20], [21]) reported indications of a bidirectional Granger causality between
energy consumption and economic growth, which supports the hypothesis of feedback. Those
who support this hypothesis contend that energy consumption and economic growth are
interlinked, which leads to an argument that energy policy should aim at increasing the
efficiency of energy use instead of conservation, so that production isn’t deteriorated. The
fourth group of studies ([9], [22]) suggested that energy consumption affects neither income
nor economic growth, meaning these studies found no causality from the consumption of
energy to the growth of the economy, which they considered as independently functioning
variables, a hypothesis which affirms energy neutrality. Those who support this hypothesis
assert that since the consumption of energy has minor influence on the growth of the
economy, governments are free to enact energy policies which are ecologically-friendly,
aiming to reduce environmental pollution. For example, imposition of carbon tax on output
and introduction of subsidy on energy consumption are two recommended policies which can
motivate the use of environmentally-friendly technology in industrial production to keep
pollution at minimal levels. Obviously, the previous hypotheses indicate that an in-depth
3

understanding of the nexus between energy consumption and economic growth is necessary
for the careful formation of energy policy.
As reflected above the recent literature provides contradictory empirical results of the
nexus between energy consumption and economic growth. One study by Toman and
Jemelkova [23] demonstrated a divergent relationship between climate and dynamics of the
pattern of energy consumption in the countries under study. Also, Ewing et al. [24] indicated
that one reason for divergence was the heterogeneous financial structure of those countries
being studied. They argue that since the growth of each country’s economy is unique, their
enslavement on energy-consuming technology may also differ. Also, Ozturk [25] points out
methodological flaws, and how conflicting results from omission of variable bias; while
Smyth [26] highlights how different data are used depending on what span of time is
considered. Smyth [26] argues the major limitation imposed by the use of aggregated data is
the difficult of identifying links between particular types of energy consumption and
economic growth. He asserts that as each country uses different energy sources for
production, different factors influence energy consumption as well as economic growth.
Therefore, the nexus between energy consumption and economic growth should be
investigated using a multivariate setting instead of a bi-variate setting, with some other
influential variables added that may cause economic growth as well as energy consumption.
Karanfil [27] argues that those making policy should consider the use of varied sets of data
and methodology, unless the results are robust and consistent.
Nonetheless, the above contradictory empirical results encourage us to reinvestigate
the nexus between economic growth and energy consumption, given the multivariate setting
for Denmark, considering technological innovation as an additional exploratory variable. We
believe that due to the mixed nature of the results, that technological innovation influences
energy consumption both directly and indirectly, and that enhanced technological innovation
reduces energy consumption through developing green and energy saving technologies and
energy efficiency. We also believe that technological innovation increases energy supplies
and energy security through developing alternative renewable energy sources, and that better
technological innovation can make it possible to achieve both sustainable economic growth
and environment security at the same time, by reducing dependency on fossil fuel. But, no
previous studies have so far investigated whether or not technological innovation causes
energy consumption in the case of any countries, whether developed or developing. In this
study, we include energy price in the multivariate model because of its effect on both energy
consumption and economic growth. Evidence suggests that energy price reinforces energy
consumption more or less which ultimately affects the energy production process. Higher
energy price may cause energy crisis in industrial production, which is evident from two
energy crises during 1970s [28]. On the other hand, low energy price may increase energy
waste and energy inefficiency. In addition, energy price may become one of the reasons for
creating energy scarcity in the industrialization and production process.
In selecting sample/data on an appropriate country, however, the study considers
Denmark for some valid reasons. First, Denmark is recognized as one of the world’s most
energy-efficient countries. As a member of the International Energy Agency (IEA), Denmark
is highly concerned about its economic development, energy security, and environment
protection1 as a condition of the agency for which technological innovation is vital. Second,
Denmark is considered as a pioneer and leader among the IEA2 member countries in terms of
policy formulation for energy in energy efficiency, climate change, and renewable energy3.

Third, it is Denmark that articulates Energy Strategy 2050 for the first time to replace fossil
fuel (especially oil, coal and gas) with increasing energy efficiency and renewable green
energy (especially wind and biomass) completely by 20504. So, it is a big challenge for the
country to replace a stable energy system with only wind and biomass energy. In this case, it
is important to know how technological innovation can play a role in bringing energy
efficiency and innovating new technology supportive in building a carbon free society. To the
best of our knowledge, no previous studies have examined the debate on energy consumption
and economic growth for Denmark, except a few cross country studies, such as [28], [29].
This study is expected to contribute to the energy consumption and economic growth
literature in contextually and empirically. It investigates relationship dynamics of
technological innovation, energy price, economic growth and energy consumption of
Denmark using annual time series data from 1970 to 2012. The investigation process uses an
autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach to assess the long-term relationship
dynamics between the key variables, for a valid reason which we will discuss in the section
on methodology. Furthermore, the study examines causality among the variables using
Granger procedure within the VAR. The study includes the results of some diagnostics
checking the model’s reliability including tests of functional form, normality, serial
correlation and heteroscedasticity. In addition, the study employs a stability test including
cumulative sum and cumulative sum square, based on residuals from recursive regression.
The structure of the paper: Section 2 reviews data and methodology, following an analysis of
findings in Section 3. Section 4 offers some concluding remarks as well as reviewing some
policy implications.

METHODOLOGY
Data and Variables
The study investigates the relationship dynamics between economic growth, the price of
energy, technological innovation and energy consumption, over the short as well as the long
term. For an empirical test, this study considers Denmark, which is recognized as a very high
energy efficient country. The study uses data collected annually between 1970 and 2012.
Data was taken from the dataset World Development Indicator (WDI) 2013. Variables of
interest include energy consumption (kg of oil equivalent per capita) (EUC) as a dependent
variable, and gross domestic product per capita (considered constant at the 2005 price)
(GDPC) as a proxy for economic growth, total number of energy-efficient patent application
(TP), and consumer price index (CPI) as explanatory variables. The consumer price index
(CPI) is used as a proxy for energy prices, and number of energy-efficient patent application
(TP) is considered as an indication of technological innovation. Except for CPI, other data
series were converted into natural logarithms. The relationships among the variables for the
linear model were considered in functional form as follows:
EUC = ƒ (GDPC, TP, CPI)

(1.0)

Specification of Econometric Models
This study was done employing the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) technique as
developed by Pesaran et al. [30] for assessment of the long-term relationship dynamics (i.e.

relationships with a tendency to change) between the key variables. This methodology has
some key characteristics, such as (i) the co-integration relationship, which is estimated using
ordinary least squares (OLS), after choosing the respective lag order of the model used; (ii)
the approach by Johansen and Juselius, a technique which remains statistically significant
regardless whether the variables are I(0) or (I(1) or mutually co-integrated, which typically
explains the position that it might not be necessary for a unit root test; (iii) additionally, it
should be stated that the ARDL method is necessary and valid for small and finite data set
[31]; (iv) this approach provides unbiased estimates over the long-term provided some of the
model regressors are endogenous [10], [32]; and (v) in addition, this method simultaneously
assesses the short term and long term effects of each variable upon another, and generates
separate results for short term and long-term effects [33].
While doing estimation, the ARDL bounds testing approach distinguishes variables
between being dependent and explanatory. In order to implement the procedure for bounds
testing following Ang and McKibbin [34], and Khan and Qayyum [35], the ARDL version of
the vector error correction model (VECM) from Equation (1) can be transformed as follows:

where the first difference is denoted by Δ, 0 is the component of drift, the time trend is
denoted by t, the maximum lag length is q, while the usual white noise residuals are
represented by εt.
Estimation Procedure
First, we have estimated Equation (1.1) using an OLS approach, after which we conducted a
Wald test and an F-test to find joint significance for the coefficients of lagged variables for
examining the existence of long-term relationship dynamics between the variables. The null
hypothesis that a long-term relationship does not exist is denoted by (FLEUC(LEUC|LGDPC,
CPI, LTP). Hence, the null hypothesis assumes that the variables have no cointegration, i.e.,
(H0): = = = m
, while the alternative hypothesis (H1) is: ≠ ≠ ≠ m ≠ . The F
statistics is then compared with the critical value (upper and lower bound) given by Pesaran
et al. [30]. Second, after establishing the co-integration relationship among the variables, the
ARDL model’s long-term coefficient can be estimated as below:

For this process, we used Schwarz-Bayesian criteria (SBC) criteria to select the
appropriate lag length used in the ARDL model. Finally, as shown below, we estimate the
short-term relationship dynamics with the error correction model (ECM) as below (Equation
1.3):

Diagnostic and Stability Test of the Model
6

For checking the reliability of the model, several diagnostic tests were conducted, as implied
by Pesaran and Pesaran [36]. These diagnostic tests included testing for normality, serial
correlation, heteroscedasticity and functional form. In addition, we also conducted the
stability tests used by Brown et al. [37], known as the cumulative sum (CUSUM) and
cumulative sum of squares (CUSUMSQ) tests, which are based on the recursive regression
residuals.

EMPIRICAL RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
Unit Root Analysis
For co-integration, analysis starts with determination of which properties of the time series
are univariate. For co-integration, the concept requires that the set of variables to be
integrated are of the same order with stationary linear combinations. If the data series do not
follow the same order of integration, then no meaningful relationship can be shown. Whereas
if the series to be integrated are of the same order, one can proceed to the test of cointegration.
Unit root tests for stationarity are performed at the levels and first differences for all
variables. Although ADF tests (Table 1) confirm that unit roots exist, and therefore the nonstationarity for the levels of only one variable, the rest of the variables show stationarity at
the first differencing level. The Dicky Fuller generalized least square test (DF-GLS) result of
is shown in Table 1. In 1996, the Dickey-Fuller test statistic was modified by Elliott,
Rothenberg and Stock [38] and they then proposed an efficient test using a generalized least
squares (GLS) rationale. They prove that this modified test has the best overall performance
in terms of small-sample size and power, conclusively dominating the ordinary Dickey-Fuller
test. In particular, they find that their DF-GLS test has significantly improved power when an
unknown mean or trend is present. However, the variables on which the DF-GLS test has
been conducted include energy consumption per capita (EUC), gross domestic product per
capita (GDPC), total number of energy-efficient patent application (TP), and consumer price
index (CPI).

This paper also notes that there is no need to check the order of integration of the
respective variables to conduct an ARDL bound test using the methodology of Pesaran et al.
[30]. We conducted the unit root test to ensure no variable surpasses the order of integration
I(1). This is because an F-test would be spurious when variables are stationary at 2nd
difference [39]. This technique is followed precisely to show the appropriateness of applying
the ARDL approach, as opposed to other standard approaches for co-integration. The unit
root test showed a mixed order of integration and all variables were found to be stationarity at
I(0) or I(1), which supports our decision to employ the ARDL bounds test instead of the
approaches used by Johansen, or Engle and Granger.
Cointegration Analysis
This study used the ARDL bounds tests approach to test for the existence of co-integration.
To determine the appropriate lag length for the series and to compute the F-statistics for cointegration, we considered lag 1, based on the significant minimum lag values of LR, FPE,
AIC, SC and HQ criterion (Table 2).

The F-statistics under the Wald Test measures the joint effect of all regressors, where
the output shows there is only one co-integration among the variables. The calculated Fstatistics (FLEUC(LEUC|LGDPC, CPI, LTP) is 3.618, which is higher than the Pesaran critical
value of 3.49. This indicates that the null hypothesis of no co-integration is rejected at a
significance level of 5% (Table 3). We further compared the calculated F-statistics value with
the critical value of Narayan [40], which is considered as better than Pesaran critical value, as
it was developed through applying stochastic simulations specific to the sample size based on
40,000 replications. Considering the critical value supported by Narayan [40], there is only
one co-integration at 10% level.

Assessment of Long Run and Short Run Scenarios

(EUC). Here, we selected the optimal lag length utilizing the Schwartz
Bayesian Criterion
ARDL co(SBC), because Pesaran and Shin [41] argue that the SBC-based
ARDL
model performs
integrating
better than the AIC-based model. Real GDP per capita shows bounds
a positive and statistically
significant influence on energy consumption (EUC) over the long-term. This finding is
conforming to the one obtained recently by Menegaki [42], who provided evidence that the
long run elasticity of GDP growth with respect to energy consumption is not independent of
the method employed for cointegration. In fact, the impossibility of determining a general
9

rule governing the directionality between energy and growth cannot question the very fact
that growth requires energy and that the efficiency gains induced by technological advances
have not alleviated this strong link [43]. However, the price level (CPI) and technological
innovation (TP) have statistically significantly negative influence on energy consumption
(EUC) in the long run. Assuming all other factors remain constant, a 1% increase in
technological innovation will reduce energy consumption by 0.058% in the long run. A
recent study [44] does conform to our empirical finding in that investments in renewables
technology would slowdown the accumulation of capital outside the energy sector, GDP
growth, the rate of energy resource depletion, and environmental degradation.

Just like long-term scenario, Table 5 depicts the short-term elasticity of the respective
variables on the energy consumption (EUC). Real GDP per capita is found to have a positive
and statistically significant influence on EUC in the short-term. Several previous studies ([2],
[3], [4], [5], [45]) also found similar findings on the relationship dynamics of economic
growth and energy consumption. Also, as like as the long run scenario, both the price level
(CPI) and technological innovation (TP) have statistically significantly negative influence on
EUC in the short run. Assuming all other factors remain constant, in the short run, a 1%
increase in technological innovation will reduce energy consumption by 0.036%. Obviously,
both the long run and short run relationship dynamics, as discussed above, are compatible in
the case of Denmark.

It is now most important, in order to ensure the convergence of the dynamics to longrun equilibrium, that the sign of the lagged error correction term (ECMt-1) must be negative
and statistically significant. Here, we found negative sign of the coefficient of the lag error
correction term (ECMt-1) which indicates the disequilibrium of the long-term equilibrium and
short-term. The estimated ECM coefficient is -0.614, which indicates that any deviation from
the long-term equilibrium between variables will be corrected by about 61.4% each year, and
that after about 1.628 years, long-term levels will return to equilibrium.

Causality Analysis
Causal links between the series were examined through application of the Granger procedure
within the VAR [46]. The existence of co-integration implies that a causal link exists in at
least one direction. The results for the Granger causality test in Table 6 show short-term bidirectional link from energy consumption (EUC) to price level (CPI) and from technological
innovation (TP) to energy consumption (EUC) at 5% significance level. These indicate that
higher energy consumption leads to an increase the price level, and that higher technological
innovation leads to less energy consumption in Denmark. As presented above our empirical
findings of the causality between energy consumption and price level as well as technological
innovation and energy consumption do conform to the ones obtained previously ([16], [17],
[18], [19], [20], [21]).

Diagnostic and Structural Stability Tests
The models passed through several diagnostic tests (Table 7). These diagnostic tests confirm
that the models show no serial correlation problem, no functional error, no problem with
abnormality, and no problem with heteroscedasticity. The value of R2 is above 61%. Thus no
problem was found with the diagnostic test and the structural stability test, and the moderate
value of R2 indicates that the model has a good fit.

Since the stability of the energy consumption (EUC) function is vital for any
economic and environmental policy to be sound, an important part of our empirical analysis
is testing whether the estimated models have shifted over time. Figure 2 shows that the plots
of the CUSUM and CUSUMSQ statistics are within critical bounds, which indicates that the
parameters of the energy consumption (EUC) function are stable during the sample period.

CONCLUSIONS
of Recursivedynamics
Residualsof technological innovation, energy price,
The study investigates the relationship
economic growth and
1.5energy consumption of Denmark. The ARDL approach reveals that
real GDP growth influences energy consumption positively and significantly both in the short
run and long run 1.0
while energy prices and technological innovation influence energy
consumption negatively and significantly also both in the short run and long run. The result
0.5
of bound test implies that higher economic growth for Denmark requires continuous energy
supply and technological
0.0 innovation, and hence proper energy pricing may play a significant
role in managing energy supply. On the other hand, findings of causality test show that

and it will not face a big challenge to reduce the dependency of fossil fuel and keep reliance
on renewable energy sources. Also, Granger causality test reveals that both technological
innovation and energy price Granger cause energy consumption. This implies that
technological innovation and energy price place significant role in bringing energy efficiency
and carbon free society.
Considering the above circumstances, we think Denmark should adopt an eco-friendly
conservative energy policy and reduce reliance on fossil fuel energy by 2050. Though 80
percent of its current energy comes from fossil fuel, energy consumption of the country does
not affect its GDP growth. But from a business point of view, greater energy efficiency is of
importance as it has direct economic benefits such as increased competitiveness and higher
productivity [47], [48].. Moreover, to reduce energy consumption and costs it is essential to
integrate enhanced management concepts and systems considering energy efficiency as a
strategic factor alongside with technological measures [49]. In conjunction with this, energy
price and technological innovation can be used in formulating a conservative energy policy.
Currently, fossil fuel is cheaper than renewable energy in Denmark. Therefore, Denmark can
impose a carbon tax to discourage the Danish people from using fossil fuels, and use the
revenue generated to subsidize the construction of alternative energy plants based on
renewable sources including windmill, solar plant, and biomass plant. Policy settings
including putting a price on carbon emissions and redirecting investments to infrastructure,
production systems and technologies that allow products and services to be delivered at a
much lower environmental cost (lower material and energy intensity), are technically
achievable and economically viable options [50]. Thus renewable energy can become more
12

cost-effective as well as attractive to Danish energy users. Persistent technological innovation
within the country can also help to modernize and upgrade their renewable energy plants.
This will in turn enable the country to increase the efficiency of energy use, keep sources of
renewable energy attractive, and keep carbon emission to minimal levels.
