"3" "Abstract"
"4" "Time as a dimension is beguiling. Philosophy has puzzled over it, physics queried its nature, and popular culture entertained us with its peculiarities. As a construct, time is multifaceted. While we experience time, we are subject to it. We also harness time, and apply it as an instrument and a lens. However, time also represents a means to enrich knowledge of urban health. To achieve this aim will involve accounting for time as well as thinking in time."
"5" "Thinking in time within urban health draws attention to the evolution of urban contexts, such as neighbourhoods, the life-courses of these settings and, the dynamics between the life-course of people and their health in place, with the life-course of place. Thinking in time also entails attending to the nature of time itself, and the manner by which re-imagining time may transform how urban health is queried."
"6" "Cross-disciplinary in nature, and trans-disciplinary in its intent, this conceptual review reflects on observational research to consider what has been discovered about neighbo u rhood effects, and how time features in this information. Furthermore, this review outlines theories and methods for thinking in time to advance understandings of how, why and for whom neighbourhoods matter to health."

"22" "Introduction"
"23" "“It is looking at things for a long time that ripens you and gives you a deeper meaning.”   -  Van Gogh  (n . d . )"
"24" "Time as a dimension beguiles. Philosophy has puzzled over it, physics queried its nature, and popular culture entertained us with its peculiarities. Moreover, time as a construct is multifaceted. We experience time, and we are subject to it. But we also harness time, and apply it as an instrument and a lens."
"25" "From a historical vantage, within his canonical treatise ‘On Airs, Waters and Places’, Hippocrates promoted the need to  think in time  so as to understand a  population’s health (Hippocrates 1849 ). It is a perspective that has been advanced with researchers tasked to recognise that health does not “exist in a social vacuum where process and experience are un-situated in time or space, unfocused and unplaced”  (Moon 1995, p.4) . And, while substantive insights have been gained into the relationship between health and urban contexts, such as neighbourhoods, understandings of this interplay remain partial. One of the reasons for this relates to time."
"26" "With time in mind this paper has a number of aims. First, to promote  time  as an integral construct to advance understandings of how, why and for whom neighbourhoods matter to health. Second, to promote frameworks, such as the life-course perspective, to purposefully harness time. And, third to reflect on the nature of time itself, and call for a wider ranging engagement with time in the study of neighbourhoods and health."
"27" "Discussion within this paper centres on neighbourhoods, though outlined principles generalise to urban contexts more broadly. Notionally, neighbourhoods have been defined as a “bundle of spatially based attributes associated with a cluster of residences” (Galster 2001, p.2112). While the World Health Organisation (2016) frame neighbourhoods as “a local area which is defined in some way physically (for example, an estate or an area bounded by major roads) or by people’s perceptions of what constitutes their local area.” As these definitions suggest, neighbourhoods can be defined in a number of ways, and indeed neighbourhoods have defied a universal definition. This plurality will be revisited ahead with specific reference to time and how the temporal nature of neighbourhoods might be leveraged."
"28" "The paper is structured in four main parts. The first briefly outlines how and why time is seen as important to neighbourhoods and health. The second overviews how time as information is being featured in neighbourhoods-to-health research; why time should be furthered integrated into analyses, and how this might be enabled through a broadened life-course perspective. The third section considers the multiplicity of neighbourhoods, in particular from a temporal vantage. And, the fourth section calls for interdisciplinary engagement to consider the nature of time so as to transcend existing silos and enable transdisciplinary research relevant to neighbourhoods and health. Aspects of time that are addressed in this final section include: time as change, the absolute versus relational nature of time, time elasticity, time  perception, and the linearity of time and events."
"29" "Time, place and h ealth"
"30" "“Clocks slay time. Time is dead as long as it is being clicked off by little wheels; only when the clock stops does time come to life.”  -  William Faulkner (1929)"
"31" "Time  was a central character within the roots of the literature on ‘neighbourhood effects’, imbuing the classic works produced by the Chicago School of Sociology in the early to mid-twentieth century (Fischer 2013). Theirs was research conditioned on a historic context of social change and urban immigration. And, sensitised to the urban dynamics transpiring at that time, Chicago School scholars examined the consequential impact of residential stability and neighbourhood change on the social and collective functioning of resident urban populations."
"32" "In spite of such long-held recognition that  person ,  place , and  time  factors are important to understand urban contexts, neighbourhoods in health-oriented research have often been presented as if they simply materialised. Yet, to quote Pred  (1984, p.279)  the “assemblage of buildings, land-use patterns, and arteries of communication that constitute place as a visible scene” do not “emerge fully formed out of nothingness and stop, grow rigid, indelibly etched in the once-natural landscape”;  time matters ."
"33" "A historic dearth of longitudinal data that captures both context and health in place has undoubtedly played its part in foreshortening neighbourhoods-to-health research. Though another factor may relate to temporal binding and the relational hold of the present  (McMichael 1999) . George H Mead was a philosopher and social theorist who wrote on the nature of the  past , prese nt , and  future . Reflecting on Mead’s work, Flaherty and Fine (2001, p.150) highlight, that for Mead, the present represented “the paramount form of temporality.” Seen to underlie Mead’s argument was the notion that the present is an emergent phenomenon, and that it was the prism of the present which fashioned  what is  from  what was . As Flaherty and Fine express (2001, p.149), the past is there, but in the present, it is subject to “human experience: consciousness, choice, emergence, and novelty. ”  The corollary of this perspective is that the past, now out of sight, may be rendered obsolete."
"34" "The role of temporal binding in fixing attention on the present is a cogent argument particularly when the social world we inhabit, shape and, are in-turn shaped by, is perceived as increasingly ‘liquid’  (Bauman 2013) ; a world seemingly in a state of always becoming, where “change is the only permanence and uncertainty the only certainty”  (Bauman 2013, p.viii) . However, as fluid as time and neighbourhoods may be, a shallow temporal consideration of neighbourhoods runs the risk of “obscuring the deep rooted social, political, and economic mechanisms at the core of health disparities”   (Kemp, 2011, p.16) ."

"36" "“ Where is the Life we have lost in living? Where is the wisdom we have lost in knowledge? Where is the knowledge we have lost in information? ”   - T.S. Eliot (The Rock , 1962 )"
"37" "Contemporary researchers concerned with neighbourhoods and health are once again affording  time  and dynamic processes prominence within their arguments and conceptual models  (Cummins et al. 2007, Daniel et al. 2008, Duncan et al. 1998, Macintyre et al. 2002) . In parallel, time and its interaction with people and place has featured in the reflections of thinkers in aligned disciplines including: demography  (Bell 2015, Entwisle 2007, Matthews 2011a) , epidemiology  (Berkman and Kawachi 2000, Krieger 2001, Morris 1988) , geography  (Hägerstrand 1975, Kwan, 2013) , and sociology  (Maines 1987, Mallinson et al. 2003, Pred, 1984) ."
"38" "Indeed as the field of urban health has advanced, and data-sets are expanded to encompass repeated measures of health  and  of the environment, there has been an increasing flow of research exploring how neighbourhoods impact health over time. These longitudinal studies are variegated in nature querying diverse neighbourhood exposures in relation to a range of health and wellbeing indicators via an array of analytical approaches. They are also disparate in their treatment of time. For example, some studies explore the manner by which  changes  in neighbourhood factors predict  changes  in health  over  time  (Brenner et al. 2015, Casey et al. 2018, Hirsch et al. 2014, Mair et al. 2015, Xu et al. 2013) . In analyses of this type time bounds and partitions enquiries, with repeated measures of exposures and outcomes aligned with pre-defined and or pragmatically studied increments of time. Yet, other longitudinal studies have formally framed their enquiries on the basis of a  life-course perspective ."
"39" "The life-course perspective"
"40" "Time is an integral element of the life-course perspective  (Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002, Mills 2000, Musterd et al. 2012);  whether it is the temporal element: of  timing  that forms the basis of  critical period  models, or the  accumulation of risk  over the lifespan; or the clocks of  age ,  period ,  cohort ,  duration  and  durability . And, there are a mounting number of neighbourhood studies that have examined aspects of urban health through a life-course perspective, variously focusing on temporal aspects related to:  timing  ( Glass and Bilal 2016, Murray et al. 2012, Pearce et al. 2018, Næss and Leyland 2010, Wight et al. 2013) ;  duration  (Stafford et al. 2008, Chum and O′Campo 2013, Mohnen et al. 2013) ;   strength of the exposures relative to duration  ( Meliker and Jacquez 2007, Musterd et al. 2012) ;  temporal lag  ( Subramanian and Kawachi 2004) ;  accumulation over time/residential histories   (Murray et al. 2010, Pearce et al. 2018, Wheeler et al. 2012, Hystad et al. 2013, Gustafsson et al. 2014) ; and  intergenerational transmission  ( van Ham et al. 2012, Pais 2014, Sharkey and Faber 2014) ."
"41" "Time (-space) geography within a life-course framework"
"42" "Many of the ascribed neighbourhoods-to-health studies that have applied a life-course perspective can be seen to have concurrently applied a time geography approach. Time geography, or time-space geography, is an integrative framework conceived by Torsten Hägerstrand. It is a framework that recognises the spatio-temporal nature of people (Hägerstrand  1975) . Therein, it is framework that aims to account for the propensity of people to variously spend time within a given locality, as well as to move across space over time, thereby drawing attention to their interactions within multiple realms that encompass and stretch beyond focal localities such as residential neighbourhoods  ( Hägerstrand  1975, Kwan 2004) ."
"43" "In classic applications, a time-geography approach documents the spatial trail of individuals over short-to-medium increments of time. However, within a life-course perspective, a time-geography account chronicles coarser spatial movements across the lifespan. This focus enables the creation of biographies comprised of residential careers ( Figure  ‎ 1 1 ); a function that then allows neighbourhoods-to-health researchers to examine how people’s outcomes are affected by various facets of these residential biographies ( Ben-Shlomo and Kuh 2002,  de Vuijst et al., 2016)."

"47" "From one life-course to another"
"48" "A range of factors underpin the relevance of the life-course and time-geography perspectives to neighbourhoods and health research, and function to explain their conjoint application. Primary among these is the manner in which these perspectives explicitly aim to leverage time’s traits and temporal parameters, such as order, timing, duration, frequency, temporal lags and temporal windows  (de Vuijst et al 2016) . In this manner causal inferences pertaining to neighbourhood effects can be strengthened by complementing the spatial nature of exposures with temporal elements that are likely to affect their nature and expression  (de Vuijst et al 2016, Osypuk 2013a, Merlo 2011) ."
"49" "While contexts su ch as neighbourhoods are und eniably integral components of life-course models, the intrinsic focus of the archetypal life-course framework is on explicating the  life-course of people  and their health in and over time. Yet, the principles of the life-course perspective can usefully be extended to the study of the  life-course of  neighbourhoods  ( Figure  ‎ 1 2 ), and therein an expanded study of the inter-relationships between the  life-course of place  and health in place  (Osypuk 2013b, Pearce 2015, Robert et al. 2010, Tunstall et al. 2004) . There are at least three substantive reasons that motivate the call for urban and neighbourhood health research to make the conceptual bridge from the  life-course of people  to the  life-course of place ; these relate to the development of neighbourhoods, neighbourhood selection processes and equity."

"55" "Neighbourhood development"
"56" "A life-course of place perspective naturally draws attention to the  development  of neighbourhoods. Cities and their neighbourhoods are ecological entities that evolve. This evolution may be overt, or it can be characterised by periods of stasis  (Tunstall 2016) . Evolution can also be heterogeneous. For example, in a recent analysis spanning some thirty years that tracked US-situated neighbourhoods, Williams and Emamdjomeh (2018, para.2) observed that “some cities [have] remain[ed] deeply segregated – even as the country itself [has] become [more] diverse”."
"57" "Why neighbourhoods change, or indeed remain stable, is likely complex (Meen et al. 2013). And, certainly there is a substantive body of research that examines neighbourhood change processes. However, much of this research does not concurrently examine how the health of populations co-varies with neighbourhood change while accounting for underlying neighbourhood-level developmental processes. This is limiting given that the set of developmental factors, which includes cultural, political, social, and spatial influences, invariably shapes the collection of neighbourhood affordances, salutogens and pathogens that in interaction function as an environmental press or buoy on a population’s health, both in and over time. Moreover, if the intent is to better understand the inter-relationship between neighbourhoods and health, and then apply this understanding to better health in place, then neighbourhoods need to be recognised as contexts that are in a state of being, with purposeful attention directed to their state of evolution in relation to their ecology, and the health of their peoples."
"58" "Neighbourhood selection"
"59" "The second motivation for adopting a life-course of place lens relates to  neighbourhood selection . Here again there is a complex web of local, extra-local and macro-level structural factors that variously affect how populations find their way into  or  are sorted by neighbourhoods over time  (Glass and Bilal 2016) . However, within the neighbourhoods-to-health genre, research has mainly been directed towards neighbourhood selection as social selection. The basis for this  has been a desire to include within empirical analyses factors that might account for why  people  choose  to reside in certain neighbourhoods, thereby mitigating possible confounding of the relationship between neighbourhoods and health  (Oakes 2004).  Selection factors of this type that are typically accounted for include personal traits such as attitudes and preferences, as well as socio-demographic and -economic characteristics  (Bruch and Mare 2006, Sampson and Sharkey 2008, Slater, 2013) ."
"60" "There is no doubt that the confounding nature of the  neighbourhood selection  issue has warranted, and continues to warrant attention  (Oakes 2004, Subramanian 2004) . But a temporally oriented focus on neighbourhood selection also warrants a broader gaze; one that concurrently sees that the residential choice set of individuals and populations is embedded within, and conditioned by, historically contingent socio-structural and spatial processes  (Sampson 2012) . Indeed, as Sampson  (2012, p.208)  noted, self- selection “is itself a form of neighbourhood effect”, as “neighbourhoods attract, repel, and indeed select, metaphorically speaking, the people who live there”  (Fischer 2013, p.11) ."
"61" "Why is this important? Because in and over time the duality of neighbourhood selection likely effects how neighbourhoods evolve, and moreover how people inter-relate with their environment within and across neighbourhoods. It’s a perspective brought to the fore by Williams and Emamdjomeh (2018). Augmenting their analysis of the long-run patterning of diversity and segregation in the US, Williams and Emamdjomeh (2018, para.21, 23) refer to their discussion with sociologists Kyle Crowder and Maria Krysan:"
"62" "“…although segregation is generally decreasing, factors such as social networks and communities play a large role in keeping segregation embedded in American life … ‘The separation of different racial and ethnic groups into separate social worlds means that members of different racial and ethnic groups have different lived experiences. They have different daily rounds. They’re exposed to different neighborhoods on a daily basis … We don’t have the integrated social networks. We don’t have integrated experiences through the city. It’s baked-in segregation.’”"
"63" "Equity matters"
"64" "The third motivation for a life-course of place approach relates to  equity . It has long been observed that health is unevenly distributed within cities and across their neighbourhoods. For example, in the United Kingdom and United States of America marked intra-city differentials in life expectancy have been observed across neighbourhoods that are only a train or bus-stop apart (Cheshire 2012, RWJF 2015). Moreover, such differentials in health have persisted across time and change (Dorling et al. 2000). Policy initiatives have been directed towards addressing such place-based inequities (for example,  the United States-based Hope-VI program; Popkin et al. 2009 ). Yet, many such initiatives have fallen short of substantive impacts on health equity. While reasons for these programmatic failures are many,  time  may be one associated factor. For example, inadequate attention to historic socio-political factors that fashion segregated neighbourhoods may function to generate shallow-rooted interventions that are under specified, under dosed and thereby not fit for purpose  (Krieger et al. 2012, Pearce, 2013) . Relatedly, many neighbourhoods have traits that are enduring. This ‘stickiness’ of character may yield an intractable resistance to short and medium term transformation. But this time span is often itself typical of the time range of policy cycles and neighbourhood regeneration initiatives  (Tunstall 2016) , thereby forming a temporal mismatch that may contribute to policy failure  (Lopez 2009, Sharp 2010) ."
"65" "There are other ways that time fundamentally impacts equity in the realm of neighbourhoods and health. Residential neighbourhoods function as anchors. They provide a point of reference that shapes people’s interactions with surrounding opportunities and resources, both near and far. But from a functional perspective time can present itself as a bounded resource. For example, within any given day, time can be seen to be finite. The spatial distribution of amenities, opportunities and resources, such as green space, education, health, transit, and employment, within and across a city’s neighbourhoods can therefore carry with it a time impost in the form of physical access (Stradzins et al. 2011). Moreover, given neighbourhoods  are stratified on the basis of socio-demographic and -economic factors, time imposts associated with accessibility may manifest differentially across the socio-demographic and -economic spectrum; a factor that may create a form of double-jeopardy for disadvantaged populations (Stradzins et al. 2011). As such, if health equity, and more broadly social justice, is to be adequately addressed in the contexts of neighbourhoods, there remains a need to consider neighbourhoods as opportunity structures not from a spatial perspective but rather a spatio-temporal vantage where both space  and  time are in the frame."
"66" "Neighbourhoods in Time"
"67" "“The frame through which I viewed the world changed too, with time.” – Eudora Welty (1998)"
"68" "Multiplicity of neighbourhoods"
"69" "Neighbourhoods have tended to be framed using administrative geographies, such as census tracts (for example see:  Cubbin et al. 2015, Margerison-Zilko et al. 2015, Pearson et al. 2013, Riva and Curtis 2012).  However, neighbourhoods can be operationalised in other useful ways. One alternative neighbourhood specification may frame neighbourhoods from the purview of the resident, either objectively through the genesis of an ego-centred distance based locality  (Matthews 2011b) , or on the basis of their experiential activity space  (Sharp et al. 2015, Zenk et al. 2011),  or qualitatively on the perceptual extent of their experiential realm  (Guest and Lee 1984, Vallée et al. 2015) . Customised neighbourhoods can also be fashioned by extending distance-based buffers radially from the centroid of an administrative boundary, such as a census tract, with defined localities: singular or multi-scalar in nature  (Clark et al. 2015, Duncan et al. 2014) , or the aggregate of over-lapping zones  (Hipp and Boessen 2013) . An “ecological [neighbourhood] network” may also be formed by aggregating the activity spaces of a social collective ( Browning and Soller 2014 ). And, yet another configuration may involve the construction of bespoke neighbourhoods based on the spatial clustering of environmental affordances  (Hidalgo and Castañer 2015) ."
"70" "What should now be apparent are the multiple ways in which neighbourhoods may be framed. At first blush this can be confusing, or perhaps undermine the validity of the notion of a neighbourhood. However, it is often the case that  “important causal questions are asked not within studies, but between them”  (Vandenbroucke et al. 2016, p.10). There are knowledge gains then to be made not only by  framing neighbourhoods in divergent ways but by querying the evolutionary dynamics of neighbourhood variants in conjunction with their covariance to health."
"71" "Temporal beat of neighbourhoods"
"72" "Factors such as the scale of time can condition a neighbourhood’s character . The notion that a neighbourhood’s character, and therein its influence on a population’s health may vary as a function of temporal scale is a spatio-temporal characteristic consonant with the ‘uncertain geographic context  problem’ articulated by Kwan (2012a, 2012b). It also resonates with the ‘modifiable spatiotemporal unit  problem’ expressed by Martin et al (2015); itself an extension of Openshaw’s (1984) ‘modifiable areal unit problem’. More recently, it’s a phenomenon that has been addressed by Vallée (2017,  p.6 ) in her critique of activity-space research where she argues that to date, there is a “discrepancy between the high degree of accuracy in [accounting for the] daily trajectories of  people  and the low degree of accuracy in [accounting for the] daily trajectories of  places , as though place attributes suffer from a kind of ‘jetlag’ or ‘clocklag’”."
"73" "Undoubtedly, the day-to-day dynamics of life and nature create, and give rise to distinct contexts that are socially and temporally conditioned around the clock. These patterns often follow a diurnal nature or co-vary with functional states, for example home and wor k, weekday and weekend ( Figure  ‎ 1 3 ). For example, Le Roux et al (2017) drew on detailed travel diaries observing how in aggregation the neighbourhood-level patterning of social segregation morphed and evolved over a 24-hour period in and across the ‘secteurs’ or arrondissements of Paris. While, in his classic socio-behavioural studies in the 1970s and 80s, William Whyte used direct observation, time-lapse films, and interviews to chronicle behavioural responses. These were simple everyday behavioural responses, unfolding in everyday seemingly immutable urban spaces such as plazas, an artefact of chronological shifts in light and shade, or the passage of time permitting recess from work; factors that transformed the nature of these places (Whyte 1980). The implication here is that while there is a need for a long-view of the co-evolution of neighbourhoods and health through the lens of frameworks such as the life-course perspective, there is a complementary need to lower our gaze and examine short-term transitions and cyclical shifts in the nature of places. And, there is emerging guidance for such research and practice. Fruitful here is Vallée’s (2017) conceptual work on the ‘daycourse of place’. As well as thinking outlined in discussions of ‘urban phenology’; a concept derived by its proponents Kontokosta et al (2017, p.145) from the biological sciences, and defined as “the cyclic and seasonal variations of human behavior in urban environments”."

"81" "“What then is time? If no one asks me, I know; if I wish to explain it to one who asks, I know not.”"
"82" "-  St Augustine ( 4 th  century )"
"83" "What is time?"
"84" "Beyond accounting for, and thinking in time within neighbourhoods-to-health research, there is another matter that bears some thought. It is the matter of time itself. A refrain familiar to many within the genre of neighbourhoods and health is that “people change, places change and the uniqueness of place is maintained”  (Jones and Duncan 1995, p.29) . In this expression change takes centre stage; time though is unaddressed. Is change simply a measure of time? Or, is time the medium through which change unfolds? And, for that matter, is time more than an instrumental construct? Perhaps the nature of time is inconsequential? Rather, echoing the sentiments of Feynman et al. (1989), perhaps what is important in the study of neighbourhoods and health is simply that time is measured, that this measurement is d efined, and that the change that transpires within time’s window is documented?"
"85" "Debates concerning the nature of time stretch back to the antiquities, and to this date remain unresolved  (NewScientist 2011) . For example, while Plato argued that time was absolute, Aristotle considered time to be relational   (Markosian 2014) . These discussions and perspectives are not simply antiquarian or the dominion of philosophy.  Cummins et al. (2007)   encouraged a relational view of space, place, health and time; an ontological foray that fundamentally impacted the field of place-health. In a similar vein, it is contended that knowledge of urban- and neighbourhood-health can be strengthened through a wider engagement with the nature of time."
"86" "The (non-)linearity of time, and, the (un-)ordered effect of historical events"
"87" "Many people and cultures do not view time as linear or sequential but circular or cyclical. Time, as history, matters within such a worldview though not its chronological order  (Levine, 2006; Sinha, 2011) . As writer Eudora Welty (1983) eloquently expressed “The events in our lives happen in a sequence in time, but in their significance to ourselves they find their own order, a timetable not necessarily - perhaps not possibly chronological. The time as we know it subjectively is often the chronology that stories and novels follow: it is the continuous thread of revelation.”"
"88" "Recognition that history may extend its reach in temporally distinct ways has seen this notion receive conceptual treatment. Notably,  Page (2006)  provides a broad taxonomy and analytic framework that prospectively lends itself to considerations of the influence of history on the temporal dynamics of place. Within this framework  Page (2006, p.89)  differentiates between three types of history dependent processes: “ path dependence , where the path of previous outcomes matters,  state dependence  where the paths can be partitioned into a finite number of states which contain all relevant information” and the distinctively termed concept of “ phat dependence  where the events in the path matter, but not their order”  ( Figure  ‎ 1 4 ). Applied to neighbourhoods, the practice-based implications of studying path dependence may, for example be seen as a sensitising instrument to critical junctures in the development of a neighbourhood, the identification of which might signal entry points for policy and community-based initiatives that aim to prospectively nudge its developmental trajectory."

"91" "Figure  1 4   Forms of history dependent processes"
"92" "Time elasticity and the perception of time"
"93" "There are other quirks of time that also bear some thinking. Tempo ordinarily refers to speed, pace, rate, rhythm and pulse. But as a social and experiential construct, time displays elasticity associated with perceptual variations tied to personal and collective circumstances and experiences of events  (Geddes 2011, Lewicka 2008) . Disparities in temporal perceptions are also correlated with sociodemographic factors. For example, time is perceived to pass slowly early in life but seemingly speeds up as we age  (Geddes 2011, Popova 2013) ."
"94" "The notion that time may warp is of consequence as this type of perceptual distortion may well impact people’s subjective construction of the nature of the neighbourhoods they have experienced across their lifespan. Time perception may also affect the recollection of historical events and processes causally considered to influence neighbourhood dynamics. Therein the perception of time, and times passage may function to cognitively bias prospective practice-based and policy-informed interventions."
"95" "Certainly researchers have brought attention to, and aimed to explore the discordance between objective and subjective conceptions of neighbourhood traits. For example, the spatial extent of people’s  neighbourhood boundaries ( Vallée et al. 2015 ), or disparities between  perceived and measured distances to resources within and around people’s neighbourhoods, such as food retailers and parks (Bailey et al. 2014, Baldock 2015) . Moreover, within this body of research, studies have sought to assess the correlates of observed non-concordance between perceptual and objective measures, primarily focusing on sociodemographic, cognitive, and behavioural factors. However, there is scope for research to draw further on the science of time perception with enquiry of this kind functioning to highlight novel opportunities to act on residential contexts that are situated at the intersection of intrapersonal perceptual factors and dynamic neighbourhood processes."
"96" "Times’s arrow, the multiverse and abstracting time"
"97" "Many of time’s idiosyncrasies remain contentious and contested. There is the vexing nature of the arrow of time  (Deutsch 2011) . Natural phenomena display time-asymmetry where events transpire in a unidirectional manner. Yet, there are a range of physical processes and laws that are not bound by a directionality of time  (Deutsch 2011) . There is also the concept of the multiverse derived from quantum mechanics and string theory where there is no singular now, or time  (Mullins 2011) . The notion of a multiverse parallels Schrödinger’s classic thought experiment where a hypothetical cat is in a quantum state of superposition – a linear combination of potential states of existence, or future realities that are conditional on the act of observation  (Trimmer 1980) . Notions of the multiverse, and its set of potential outcomes, also invokes comparisons to counterfactuals that underpin modern epidemiological forms of causal inference. In spite of such parallels, it can be difficult to grasp the real-world application of many of time’s peculiarities to studies of urban health. However, the abstract nature of time should not dissuade researchers from engaging with time at the ontological level. Thinking ontologically about time has the capacity to transform the “what, how, and why elements of a theory”  (George and Jones 2000, p.658) . In this regard, thinking about the nature of time may function to shape conceptual frameworks associated with urban health in the same manner as these frameworks have historically been moulded by concerns for cultural, political, social, spatial and topographic factors. Furthermore, thinking ontologically can actively transform the subject of urban health and therein the nature of the questions that the field aims to explore by integrating and transcending interdisciplinary perspectives and methods that are used to inform enquiries encompassing the dimension of time."
"98" "Conclusion"
"99" "“Change begets change. Nothing propagates so fast…The mine which Time has slowly dug beneath familiar objects is spring in an instant, and what was rock before, becomes but sand and dust.”"
"100" "- Charles Dickens (1843, p.225)"
"101" "Time as a dimensional and idiosyncratic concept has played a part in the construction of knowledge concerned with the inter-relationships between health and urban contexts such as cities and their neighbourhoods. But time also represents a fundamental means via which knowledge of urban health may be enriched. To achieve this aim will involve  accounting for time  as well as  thinking in time ."
"102" "Thinking in time in urban health naturally draws attention to the evolution of urban contexts such as neighbourhoods, the life-courses of these localities and the dynamic associations between the  life-course of people  and their affiliated health in place, with the  life-course of place . Thinking in time also directs consideration to the processes which inter-connect with evolving urban contexts. It is here, in the critical querying of time, and the dynamic processes that shape people, place and health that understanding may be enhanced of how urban health is formed, how it changes, and how it may become entrenched and reproduced in localities, such as neighbourhoods, which themselves are transforming."
"103" "Finally, thinking in time in urban health extends beyond considerations that aim to understand the embedded and embodied inter-connections between people, their life-course, and the historic, relational and evolving nature of their contexts. Thinking in time in urban health entails attending to the nature of time itself, and the manner by which reimagining time may transform how urban health is understood and investigated."
