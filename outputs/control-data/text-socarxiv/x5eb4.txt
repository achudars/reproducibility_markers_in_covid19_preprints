"5" "Will fights erupt  when  resources are scarce and the rules regulating their distribution are absent or ignored ?   We  conjecture  that the answer  depends on  whether credible information about individuals’ toughness is available. When  people send credible signs and signals of their toughness  disputes may be solved without violence.  We use a laboratory experiment in which subjects create  information   about  their toughness and decide whether to take others ’  resources and resist in case others’ attempt to take their s .  S ubjects  perform   a potentially painful   but  safe   physical  exercise to create information and to determine who wins and loses fight s . This, realistically,  ranks subjects according to their toughness and  implicates  toughness , a quality important in real conflict,   in  fighting .  We find that, consist ent  with theory,  information  reduce s  fighting.  This suggests that, in addition to  the  theories traditionally  used to explain prisoner  behavior , the availab ility of credible information about  toughness  influences  prison conflict."

"7" "Introduction"
"8" "Whe re   resources are scarce and  the  rules  regulat ing  their  distribution  are either absent or  unenforced — as  is often the case  in prison — d oes violence   inevitably  come to  dominate interactions ?   T he  answer , we argue,   depends on  the availability of credible  information  about individuals’ toughness . Here  we study the connections between information  and violence  experimentally ."
"9" "Consider ‘toughness’  as   the ability to  fight  and withs tand fighting injuries   before  yielding  to an opponent’s will . I f individuals   in conflict  over resources  have  no  information about each other’s  relative   toughness ,   we expect  that  disputes  are   likely to be  settled  with violence .   If instead individuals have information about their opponents’ toughness  we  expect   that  disputes  are  more likely to be   settled without violence   (Gambetta 2009a, 80–81) .   W hen  such  information is available, weaker individuals  do not challenge  others  and   yield to  the challenges of  tougher  opponents , w hile in its absence  even weaker individuals  may  challeng e  others and  risk  a fight .   The only case in which information does not  help — as  argued  by  the  animal  behavior  literature — is  when individuals are of  a  similar  toughness ,   thus  information cannot solve dispute s   and  violence ensues ."
"10" "By  settling  disputes through information rather than violence b oth weaker and stronger individuals  gain : the former   avoid the harm caused by violence and , we  conjecture ,  are  no  more  exploited  than in the absence of information ; while the latter  too  gain for they  do  not incur the cost of meting  out  violence, and  avoid  the in j uries that even  weaker opponent s   may  inflict."
"11" "Information on  an individual’s  toughness can be transmitted through  signals  or  signs .  Signals are actions  intentionally  taken   to  chang e  the beliefs of others about  one’s toughness .  Like signals, signs  carry information about people’s  toughness , but unlike signals  they  are not produced  and displayed  with the  intention of informing present opponents ; signs  include  information about  past actions , sometimes transmitted by   the  perceivable  traces  they leave on the body or the  demeanor   (Gambetta 2009b, 170) .  In our experiment, subjects are given the opportunity to build both signs and signals of toughness."
"12" "To  reduce  violence ,  information needs to be  credible .  A signal of  tough ness is credible if  only  truly tough  signalers  can afford  it , while none or few weaker  signalers  can . In this way   ‘ dishonest ’  signals are  impossible  or rare   allowing receiver to infer their opponents’ toughness  (Cho and Kreps 1987; Spence 1973, 1974) .  A sign   of toughness too  derive s   its  credibility from  cost discrimination —for instance,  cauliflower ears  are  credible  signs of  having endured past physical conflict .  However,  signs  are often  noisy:  a  scar or a  broken nose can indicate  as much  a  box er  as  a careless driver   (Gambetta 2009b) ."
"13" "The  fitness  advantage of solving disputes  through   ‘honest  signaling ’   of  fighting ability  is well- established in the literature on other species   (Clutton-Brock et al. 1979; Mcelreath 2003; Searcy and Nowicki 2005, 134–35; Zahavi and Zahavi 1997, 22) .  But the  connection between information and fighting has  hardly  been investigated among humans  and  only once  experimentally   (Przepiorka et al. 2018) ."
"14" "In th eir  experiment,  conducted at the same time as ours, Przepiorka et al. use a variant of the hawk-dove game to test how different information conditions shape the emergence of dominance hierarchies.  They predict with a game theoretic model and experimentally find that  fighting  generates  a  credible  reputation ,   which  reduces  conflict  in subsequent encounters , and  that hierarchies naturally emerge when  such  reputation can be transmitted."
"15" "While their results are  consistent with what we find , there are two important distinctions between the papers. First,  we  test  how signs and signals created before interaction shape conflict  in one-shot situations . Conversely, Przepiorka et al. consider  richer  situations in which subjects repeatedly interact, and, how the information generated through repeated interaction shapes conflict  later . Second,  we model interactions in which one person is the ‘ signaler ’ , who emits the signs and signals, and the other is the ‘receiver’, who perceives the signs and signals and can respond ,  but does not himself send any information. Przepiorka and colleagues, instead, model interactions in which both people are simultaneously senders and receivers observing each other’s information and responding to it. Thus, our experiments  model different but  complementary situations."
"16" "The other closest experiments come from Benard  (2013, 2015)  who focuses on  reputation systems . A  core hypothesis, for which he finds consistent support, is that  reputational systems, which support  information transmission ,   increase aggression because it  incentivizes  subjects to build up reputations to deter and intimidate others.  Although these experiments are unable  to  test how reputation systems  affect   outcomes  because  subjects  only  interact against simulated partners  who play predetermined strategies, they  do reveal  the effect that reputation has on action s  because participants believed they were facing real people."
"17" "Even non-experimental research on  the   relationship between information and fighting in humans  is sparse .  A  review of the psychological literature ,  which is rife with  studie s on  conflict,  yields no directly relevant work .  The  sole  human context , as far as we have been able to establish,  in which  this  has been studied is prison .   Prisons offer  an ideal  setting  for that purpose  because  resources are scarce ,  rules are absent or weak , prisoners  encounter many unknown other prisoners , and the  negative consequences  to  interactions can be extreme .  As a result , prisoners  have powerful incentives  to  engage in meticulous strategic reasoning   (Gambetta 2009a, 78–110; Kaminski 2003, 2004) .  Evidence  from a range  of qualitative and quantitative  sources lend s  support for the effect of information on prison violence  and shows that variations in interpersonal  fights  are consistent with variations in information   (Gambetta 2009a, 78–110; Kaminski 2004) . While promising,  however, this evidence  rests on observational data. In this paper we test whether some of these connections hold in an artificial but controlled experimental lab setting."
"18" "A few further works develop related ideas. In  Collision of Wills   (2003) , the late sociologist Roger Gould, holds that fights over status are more likely to occur in ‘symmetrical relations’, for instance, amongst brothers, friends, and peers, than between individuals who are part of hierarchical  organizations  in which rank is clear. ‘Symmetrical relations’ could be taken as an approximation of ‘similar fighting ability’, and hierarchical rank as one of the several forms in which resource distribution is normatively governed. Robinson  (2001) , too, builds a model of social identity and conflict and predicts that, generally, inter-ethnic conflict is greater when the groups have more equal resource distributions. In  the  political science  literature , Fearon  (1995)   argues that a lack of information can drive war. Yet, his work is applied to state-level conflicts and not to inter-personal interactions."
"19" "D eprivation and importation theory  are the two theories traditionally used to understand prison fighting   (e.g. Cao, Zhao, and Van Dine 1997; DeLisi, Berg, and Hochstetler 2004; Gover, Pérez, and Jennings 2008; Jiang and Fisher-Giorlando 2002; Lahm 2008) . The former posits that fighting is a function of the ‘pains of imprisonment’, while the latter argues that it is the culture acquired by individuals outside of prison that determines it  (Clemmer 1940; Dobbs and Waid 2004; Irwin and Cressey 1962; Sykes 1958) . In our experiment, we control for these theories’ posited factors as our  subjects experience the same deprivations, and since they are randomly allocated to treatments and come from a pool of similar students ,   they should  import  broadly  the same culture."
"20" "In addition to testing the effect of information on fighting, we also test two different  signaling  theories:  in addition to describing the conditions under which signals credibly transmit information (as we already mention),  signaling  theory  proper ,  predicts  how much different  type of  people  will si gnal   (Spence 1973, 1974) . A  core  proposition of this  the ory is that"
"21" "( i )  people with a high  level of a quality, toughness in our case, sign al  with higher intensity  than people with a low er  level of the same quality .  A n  extension of th e standard  signaling  m o del , called c ounter- signaling  theory   (Feltovich, Harbaugh, and To 2002)  introduces two variations:   instead of two types of people, it  posits  three – low, medium, and high  quality — and  assumes that some   exogenous noisy information  already gives some information to receiver before their receive intended signals. ‘S igns ’   in our experiment  embody this exogenous information .  With these  modifications , a different prediction emerges:"
"22" "( ii )  medium tough ness  people  signal  with the highest intensity   while  not only  the weak er subject but  also  the tough est   ones  too  signal  with lower intensity .  Medium  types  signal to  avoid being mistaken as weak , weak   types signal  little  because  signaling  is too costly for them ,   and  the truly tough  also signal  little ,  they   ‘counter-signal’ ,  to avoid  appearing like  over-eager medium s ."
"23" "A handful of  experiments test  signaling  theory   (Bolle and Kaehler 2007; Gambetta and Przepiorka 2014; Kübler, Müller, and Normann 2008; Przepiorka and Diekmann 2013) , and find clear support for its predictions,  while   only  two  experiments  test counter- signaling  theory   (Feltovich, Harbaugh, and To 2002; Gambetta and Székely 2014)  and  find  ambiguous   results . In our experiment, we implement one treatment  (the signal  treatment) that  supports only  signaling  and another treatment  (the  sign+signal treatment)  that  tries to  capture the  countersignalling  model’s conditions . This allows us to  assess  whether counter- signaling  emerges in a n environment that provides fertile ground for  it ."
"24" "D esign  and hypotheses"
"25" "To  reproduce  in the lab   the essence of  a  typical prison  situation  in which fighting over resource s   may  occur ,   we  introduce  two characters  and make them play a game ( Figure  1 ) . Although in the experimental instructions we refer to these characters  using  abstract terminology ,  consider them as  established  prisoner s ,  ‘ veterans ’  ( V ) ,  and  as  newcomer s  to that prison ,  ‘rookies’ (R) .  We assign more resources to R  (10)  than to  V  (3) to induce through the ir  payoffs the incentives that real prisoners typically have to  covet the  resources  of  newcomers.   V   decide whether to ignore  R  or try  to  take  the ir  resources .  If  V  choose to  ignore ,  this   maintains  the  status quo , so V retain 3  and  R keeps 10, for whom this  is  the  preferred outcome. If   V  choose to challenge  R ,  R   then  decide whether to  yield  or  to  resist. If  R   yield ,  this  leads to  exploitation  and  R  is left with 3. While this  is  the preferred outcome of  V  who  thereby   r everse  the  resource allocation  and obtains 10 . If  R   resist a  fight  ensues  (we describe in Section  2.1  how fights are settled) .  Losers get nothing ,  but winners  too   pay a cost , whether they are  R  or  V   and receive only  6.  Overall, fights imply an efficiency loss relative to status quo or exploitation  since the combined outcome from fighting ( 6+0 ) is less than the combined outcomes from status quo ( 3+10 ) and exploitation ( 10+3)."
"26" "Figure  1 . Our prison entry game."
"27" "I n our  imagined  prison ,  inmates , new and  old  alike,  are  divided in to  three  grades  of relative toughness: tough ( A ) ,   medium tough ( B )  and  weak ( C ) , each corresponding to a third of the individuals.   ( We  refer to  V  and R of varying grades, and who know they possess these grades, with  V X  and R X  where X is either A, B, or C ) .   In our experiment we use a non-harmful pain generating ‘ wall sit ’ exercise to assess subjects’ toughness  (described below in Section  2.1 )."
"28" "Consider now  information  concerning toughness. We assume that both  V  and  R   always  know  their own  toughness grade s .   T hen  we have two condition s:   in  the first  condition   V   do not  know  the  grade  of  R ,  and  R   know  that  this  is the case  (‘no information’ condition) . In the second  condition ,  V  know the  grade  of  R ,  and  R  know  that this is the case  (‘information’ condition ).   By contrast, we assume that as newcomers to a prison in neither condition R know anything about the toughness of  the specific  V  they face, although they hold uniform prior distributions about the toughness of the V in the population and this is the case in the experiment."
"29" "V   come to know  something about   the  toughness   of R  through   signs  of   grade — indirect information on  actions R took  that reveal something of  their  toughness , e.g.   the crime  R  is jailed for, previous  prison records,  previously acquired fighting  reputation   that  are often advertised   through prison  grapevine  or other media , and   signals — actions  that  R   take  in order  to  show  V   their toughness ."
"30" "While we use the labels veterans and rookies to elucidate  our  interaction, these role names  should be considered as ‘stand- ins’ that are more precisely defined by the distribution of information between the players: one of whom can have information about the other while the other never does. Thus, our situation applies just as well to two established prisoners in conflict—one of whom has information about the other, and to two rookies in conflict—one of whom knows something relevant about the other."
"31" "We make  two  hypothes es  concerning agents’ decis i ons  in the interaction . When  V  have credible information on the toughness of R ,  V  challenge less   (H1) . This, in terms of  outcome s , implies that the  ‘ status quo ’  increases to the advantage of R . Next ,  when V has information on the toughness of R,  R resist the same or less   (H2).  If the changes in decisions  that  we  hypothesize  in  H1 and  in  H2  both occur,  we predict that outcomes should vary thus:  ‘ exploitation ’   may increase but could also  remain the same and  not get  any  worse; most importantly ,   ‘ fight s’  decrease , with the result of generating a more efficient overall outcome ."
"32" "Here we describe how subjects might reason  in making their decisions  in our experiment , leading to our hypotheses , and f or  simplicity  we  focus on  the two extreme toughness types, A and C.  The formal model s  whence our hypothes es derive ,  is in S2  Appendix ,  and  the predicted actions of V and R are shown in  Table  1  and  Table  2 ,  while   the hypotheses ar e specified precisely in   Table  3 .  We model the two conditions using a  game of asymmetric information,  f or the no information condition,  and  a game of complete information, for the information condition,  and solve for equilibria to derive the predictions.  Remember, we refer to V and R with varying grades using V X  and R X  where X is either A (the toughest ),  B (intermediate), or C (the weakest)."

"83" "Start with  V A  ( Table  1 ) .  With out  information on   the grade s of   R ,   V A   expect   to win  all   fights  except  a fraction of  those  against R A .   This encourages  V A  to  challenge   all  R   since the  gain  from ignoring  are  low  and benefits of exploiting are  sufficiently  high  to risk fights—which in any case V A  wins in all cases except when facing R A .  With information on  R ,  V A   will challenge  R B   and   R C , but when facing  R A ,   who are  as tough as they are  and thus expected to resist ,   V A   will be   ‘ indifferent ’  between ignoring  and challenging  ( Table  2 ) .   W ith information ,  therefore ,   V A  make   at most  similar or  fewer challenges."
"84" "Consider now  V C  ( Table  1 ) .   With  no info rmation on  R ,  V C  expect  to lose  most  fight s (all those against  R A  and  R B  and  some  of those against  R C ). But  strategic  V C   anticipate  that  all  R C  and some R B ,   afraid of  encountering and resisting against  V A ,  will yield   and thus challenge R  hid ing  behind the fear created by  V A .  When information about the toughness of R  is present ,  by contrast,  V C   does not challenge  R A , for they know they  would  lose in a fight  ( Table  2 ) .  Our first hypothesis therefore is that  w ith  information there  are  fewer challenges.   In terms of outcomes, this implies that   with information  there is  an increase in status quo   to the advantage of R ."
"85" "Consider now the perspective of  R A  ( Table  1 ) . R emember that  R   are never told   the grade of  V ,  but R know whether  or not  V  are told  the  grade  of R . H ence R know whether  the  decisions  of  V   rely on that information .   When  V  ha ve  no information on  R ,  R A  choose to  resist  all  challenge s  as the probability that they win in any fight is so high ( they expect to  always  win  against   V B  and  V C ,  and  to  win  some  of the time  against  V A ).   W hen  V  has  information  on  R  grade ,  R A   may   anticipate  that most  V  who  challenge  are   of  A  grade  but also a few weaker V  who bluff . Since R A  win against V A  some of the time and always against V B  and V C , the n their  reasoning could  be  that on average it is to their advantage to  resist  ( Table  2 ) ."
"86" "Finally, c onsider the perspective of   R C  ( Table  1 ) .   When  V  has no information on   the  grade  of R ,   R C  should choose to yield every time, as the y  expect to lose  most   fights .   When  V  has information on  R  grade, nothing should change and   R C   should  also  yield all the time  expecting to lose most fight  ( Table  2 ) .  Our second hypothesis is in two parts:   With information  resisting  stay s  the same .   However, if we consider the  behavior  of R B   resisting may decrease .  This is because i n the absence of information R B  are indifferent between yielding or resisting, and so some proportion of them resist, while, when there is information R B  always yield."
"87" "In terms of outcomes,  w e predict  first as we said already  that ,   when information is introduced, the status quo increases  as a result of fewer challenges ; next, that  exploitation does not decrease, but it remain s  the same or increase s .  This is because w hen V has information both R B  and R C  yield and so  the majority of interactions end in exploitation , but w hether this level of exploitation is equal or greater than what happens without information depends on what R B  does :   while i t is clear that R A  resist and R C  yield, R B  may yield or resist. If R B  yield then most of the interactions end in exploitation, therefore the level of  exploitation is the same   in the two conditions  since again both R B  and R C  are exploited. If R B  resist, by contrast only  R C   are   exploited. In this case exploitation is lower without information and  increases   with information ."
"88" "For the third outcome ,  the above reasoning  implies,  most  importantly, that  fight s  decreases with information . The combination of fewer challenges and no change or decrease in resisting  entails  a reduction in fighting."

"110" "Our final hypotheses concern  signaling  and countersignalling theory. If  signaling  theory holds tru e in our information treatments then  we expect that  tougher R signal more  intensely  than weaker R (H3) .

"111" "Measuring toughness  and fighting : the  wall sit"
"112" "We use a non-harmful pain generating ‘ wall sit ’ to  assess  toughness. In this exercise, subjects bend their knees and lean against a wall such that their shins are parallel to the wall and their thighs are  parallel to the floor.  Wall sit ting  has been used a few times  in experiments  to measure  altruism,   the trade-off between pain and gain ,  and  to test  whether enduring pain promotes in-group cooperation  and  is related to the  number of friends   (Bastian, Jetten, and Ferris 2014; Cabanac 1986; Harrison and El Mouden 2011; Harrison, Sciberras, and James 2011; Johnson and Dunbar 2016; Madsen et al. 2007) .   It has never been used to measure toughness."
"113" "To  represent  fights  in the experiment , we use a competitive  wall sit .  Here ,  subjects  simultaneously  wall sit  and the winner ,  the person who endures longer in the position , takes  the loser’s money.  In contrast to prior experiments on conflict, which typically use self-reported  experience of  fighting   (Archer and Benson 2008; Archer and Webb 2006; O’Connor, Archer, and Wu 2001)   or  fighting as a  potential  loss of money  (Benard 2013; De Dreu et al. 2016; McDermott et al. 2007; McIntyre et al. 2007; Przepiorka et al. 2018) , our competitive  wall sit   captures key elements of real fights:  it   can be  painful and requires both physical  resilience  and toughness."
"114" "To validate  wall sit ting as a measure of toughness  and  as a model for fighting ,  we record a set of variables that may express toughness  and pain resilience  in other ways: we ask subject s  to rate their fitness, frequency of exercise , and ability to withstand pain ; and  to  answer the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire (BPAQ),  a  widely used tool in psychology to measure aggression   (Buss and Perry 1992) . We also  measure  the  ratio between the length of  2 nd  digit and that of the  4 th  digit   (2D:4D)  on the right hand of subjects , which has been found to correlate with   a variety of aggressive  behaviors  in men  (Hönekopp and Watson 2011; Manning et al. 1998) .  W e find in a  multivariate  linear regression that  wall sit  times , that is how long subjects maintain the position,  are related to pain resistance ( b=16.55 ,  s.e.=5.15 , p=0.0 02 ), fitness ( b=12.90, s.e.=6.03, p=0.034 ), 2D:4D ( b=-221.19,  s.e.=104.20, p=0.035 ),  and body mass index (b=-2.86, s.e.=1.55, p=0.068)  but not related to  the BPAQ, frequency of exercise, and  age  ( Table A1 ) .  There are no issues of multicollinearity (all VIFs are below 2).  Thus,  wall sit ting captures toughness and requires attributes that are present in real fighting."
"115" "Method"
"116" "We use a  three - step procedure   (Gambetta and Przepiorka 2014; Gambetta and Székely 2014) . S ubjects  first  generate   a   sign of their toughness by doing the  wall sit  for gain ,  without knowing  the details of the experimental stages  that follow . Thus they do not  wall sit  thinking that they are creating information but for gain: every second they stay in the position they earn €0.02 . T his stage , which  we call  the  veiled sit , allows us to measure subjects’ natural toughness without polluting it with strategic concerns."
"117" "N ext, the details of the experiment are unveiled , and e veryone learns:"
"118" "that their time in the veiled sit is used to assign them a grade : t hose  wall sit ting  for the longest  1/3rd are allocated an A, those in the middle 1/3rd receive a B, and  those  in the  bottom 1/3rd receive a C;"
"119" "which grade they obtained in the veiled sit ;  and"
"120" "how  the prison entry game  works ."
"121" "Furthermore we tell them that:"
"122" "they will play   the prison entry game  a number of times , both as  V  and as R,  with randomly matched partners  whose identifies are mutually anonymous ;"
"123" "before playing the game  they will redo the  wall sit , this time  unpaid  but with full knowledge of the details of the experiment; in this way, subjects can create a signal of their toughness ( unveiled   sit );"
"124" "they will receive another grade  A, B or C ,  for their performance  in the unveiled sit  and that this is allocated  relative to the veiled sit times  of their session ;  subjects whose unveiled  wall sit  time falls in the range of times for which a given grade was assigned in the veiled  wall sit , will get  that grade;"
"125" "if in the game challeng ing by  V  is met with   resistance  from R ,  there will be a  ‘ fight ’  consisting of a third  wall sit  in which the  fighters simultaneously  wall sit  and the  winner will be the person who endures longer in the position ; and"
"126" "they will be paid  randomly for one of their decisions as either  V  or R ."
"127" "In the  no information treatment  (NI)  this is all  that  subjects  are told  ( Figure  2 ) ."
"128" "What additional instructions  subjects  receive in the information treatment depends on which  of two  variant s   they  are in.  I n  one  variant  subjects are told that when playing as R, the grade they obtain in the unveiled sit will be revealed to the  V   they are partnered with  before  the  V  decide whether to challenge — this is the  signal only variant  (S)  ( Figure  2 ) .  This capture the common situation in which prisoners know nothing of each other’s previous displays of toughness, and the information they exchange is predicated on actions that they take in prison while observing each other."
"129" "In the other  variant  they are told that in addition to  the signal ( their unveiled sit grade ) , their  partnered  V  will also  be informed of  their  sign, namely their  veiled sit grade ,  before deciding how to act . And, furthermore, that the veiled sit grade, as is typical of signs, will have some ‘noise’ injected into its transmission  that eliminates B grades : before being sent, B veiled grades are transformed into A with 0.5 probability and C with 0.5 probability. T his is the  sign  and  signal variant  (s+S)  ( Figure  2 ) .   This capture the situation in which, in addition to the signal intentionally produced, some exogenous information is known about new prisoners. (We omit to study the sign only variant as it seldom occurs ‘in nature’, as it requires some very robust, noise-free indication of toughness, as when a well-known member of the mafia ends up in prison.)"
"130" "In the information treatments R have an incentive to signal and to do so honestly. This is ensured by a dual pressure. On the one hand, the payoff structure is such that tougher R always want to be perceived as tougher types for they strictly gain from deterring V than from fighting. On the other hand, the signal is so costly that only truly tough R can afford to send the highest grade. Also, V have incentives to accurately assess the toughness of R accurately. Misidentification of toughness—both  too high and too low—implies either a missed opportunity or a waste of resources, energy, and pain in a fight."
"131" "Figure  2 . The treatments and procedure."
"132" "We randomly allocate subjects to one of three information treatments in a between-subjects design.  Treatments are applied at the session level.  The full experimental instructions  and ethical statement  can be found i n  S3  Appendix .   Our data and code for the analysis and simulations are available online at  https://osf.io/yuj7v/?view_only=1d20ed5dcba0455e8d44fcc28e08ceef ."
"133" "Procedure"
"134" "We let  4-8  subjects into a large lecture room and ask them to  wall sit  simultaneously . To prevent them from perceiving  each other’s   wall sit  times they wore sleeping masks and ear protectors. Each  wall sit  session gave subjects the opportunity to stay in position for  a maximum of  six minutes, and this was public knowledge; only after this time span, regardless of whether anyone was still  wall sit ting or  simply resting sitting on the floor , the session was declared concluded. This prevented the  subjects in the same group from inferring what the longest  wall sit  time was based on how long they remained in the room."
"135" "To avoid tiring subjects, w e split each experimental session in  two parts ,  the experiment  proper  and the follow-up, held a few days later  ( Figure  2 ) . In the former ,  subjects carry out the veiled and unveiled sits, and make all of their decisions. I n the latter  subjects are told their outcomes and if  this was  a fight  they  participate  in  the competitive  wall sit  to decide the winner  and then receive  their  payment.  The others are paid right away.  In order to avoid  personalizing  the fight and breaching the anonymity of the experiment, t hose who  end up  fight ing   do the  wall sit   while wearing sleeping masks and ear protectors  just as they did in the main session ."
"136" "We use the strategy method to elicit subjects’ choices   (Mitzkewitz and Nagel 1993; Selten 1967) .  R  makes a single choice to resist or yield ,  and  V  makes a decision to challenge or ignore for each of the possible  sign-signal combinations , up to six depending on the treatment.  S pecifically,  V  make one decision in the no information treatment , for there are no signs and signals to observe , three  decisions  in the signal variant —one for an A signal, one for a B signal, and one for a C signal— and six  decisions  in the sign  and  signal variant : one for  each of the  three  signals combined with  either  a C sign or an A sign .  The order  in which  the combinations are shown to  V  is  randomized  across session s ."
"137" "Once subjects have all made their decisions, we randomly s elect whether  they  are paid  for their decisions as V or R,  then , we randomly pair V and R within each experimental session to identify the  outcome that they are paid for. We do not use these paid outcomes in our analysis as they are an unreliable indication of the outcomes that occur. This is because subjects may be matched in many ways  to determine outcomes.  Instead, t o account for this variation in matching,  we  run a simulation (using Stata v13.1 IC) in which we randomly and repeatedly pair subjects within each session and record the outcome that occurs. Specifically, we run three simulations. Each simulation is used to  explore one treatment: NI, S, and s+S. Every simulation is run for 10,000 rounds. In each simulation round :"
"138" "Every subject is partnered with a randomly allocated other subject within the same session."
"139" "One of each pair is randomly allocated to be V and the other to be R."
"140" "The outcomes are calculated based on V’s and R’s decisions, accounting, in S and s+S, for the grade of R and the grade observed by V."
"141" "Our experiment was conducted at the  [removed for anonymity]  using  [removed for anonymity]  subject pool  composed  mostly of undergraduates at the university of  [removed for anonymity] ."
"142" "198 subjects participated in our experiment.  We recruited  males between the ages of 18-40  as our subjects   to  reduce physiological differences in strength and fitness—those within this group are, on average, more  similar to each other  in isometric muscular strength and aerobic capacity   (Asmussen and Heebøll-Nielsen 1962, 167, 168; S. Robinson 1938) ."
"143" "Although  198  subjects participated in the experiment we  are able to use only   194  subjects’  sit  times and actions as  V  and R  ( actions of  R:  80  in NI, 49 in S, and 65 in s +S ;  194  in total . Actio ns of   V :   80  in NI, 147 in S, and  390 in s+S ;  617  in total ) .   We use all 194 subjects’ actions in our simulations to calculate the outcomes that occur.  We also have data  on  172  subjects for whom we know the outcome of  any  fights  that occurred  (See   Figure  3 )."
"144" "Figure  3 . The sample breakdown."
"145" "The experiment  was programmed with z-Tree   (Fischbacher 2007)  and  analyzed  using Stata v13.1  IC .  The full outputs for models reported in-text are shown  in  S1  Appendix ."
"146" "Results"
"147" "Before presenting the tests of our hypotheses, we need to check  that  ( i )  subjects’  understoo d  the  experiment  and that ( ii ) wall sitting grade is a credible source of information about the toughness of R.  With a few excep tions that are explicitly stated , w e use logistic regression s  to conduct the analyses below. When  analyzing  the actions of V we use  cluster  robust standard errors at the subject level  to account for the multiple observations per subject."
"148" "Multiple  findings  indicate that  s ubjects unders tand  the experiment .  Fir st, subjects  answer  93%  (1082/1164)   of  the  control questions  correctly .  Second,  they  respond  as expected   to their own and others’ grades demonstrating that they properly understand the information value of grades in  playing the game. Both V and R  who possess higher grades, whether veiled or unveiled, are more likely to challenge  (for V : veiled OR=2.88, z=6.64 , p<0.001;  unveiled OR=3.47, z=5.66 , p<0.001;  Table  A2 )   and to resist  (f or R veiled  OR=3.11, z=5.54 , p<0.001;  unveiled OR=4.48, z=5.26 , p<0.001;  Table A3 ).  Third, V respond  to both signs  (OR=1.58, z=5.82, p<0.001;  Table A 4 ) and signals (OR=2.40, z=6.78, p<0.001;  Table A 4 ) of toughness  by ignoring R with higher grades more ;   a nd,  consistently with a broad  signaling  theory prediction,  they respond   more to signals of toughness than to signs  of toughness  since the latter are noisier , both because we exogenously add noise to signs and because signals are harder to produce since subjects are more tired during their unveiled sit,  than the former  (OR=1.52 , z=3.37, p=0.001) ."
"149" "We also find that  wall sit ting resilience is predictive of the outcome of the  wall sit  ‘fights’ that may follow. The combatant with the longer veiled  wall sit  wins in  72 %  of cases (18/25  fights, Fisher’s exact test,  p=0.004 ), while subjects with the longer unveiled  wall sit  win every single fight (12/12 fights, Fisher’s exact test, p<0.001). This shows that wall sit grades are credible sources of information.   With these conditions satisfied, we turn to our hypotheses, which predict what happens when V have credible information on the toughness of R."
"150" "Challenging and resisting h ypotheses"
"151" "H1:  V  challenge less .  V  challenge less in the treatments with information than in NI :  79% (63/80) of  V  challenge in NI while 66% (97/147) challenge in S and 69% (268/390) challenge in s+S.  The difference between NI and S is significant  (OR=0.52 , s.e . =0.17 , p=0.046),  while the difference between NI and  s+S  approaches the 10% significance level  (OR=0.59, s.e.=0.20 , p=0.113)  ( Figure  4 A;   Table A 5 ) ."
"152" "H2: R resist the same or less . Resisting by R decreases when there is information (NI: 61% (49/80); S: 49% (24/49); s+S: 52% (34/65)), but these decreases are not  significant (NI vs. S: OR=0.61, s.e.=0.22, p=0.174; NI vs. s+S: OR=0.69, s.e.=0.24 , p=0.280)  ( Figure  4 B ;   Table A5 ) ."
"153" "Figure  4 . When there is information, (A) V challenge less and (B) R resist the same."
"154" "Outcomes"
"155" "Figure  5 . Simulations of the outcomes show that information decreases fighting, does not affect status quo, and slightly increases exploitation."
"156" "Status quo  does not change .  Contrary to our prediction, the differences in challenging do not translate into differences in status quo ( Figure  5 ). In NI  21.3 %  (s.d.=4.5%)  of groups end up in status quo while 21 .3 %  (s.d.=7.5%)   and 25.0 %  (s.d.=7.1%)   do the same in S and s+S respectively."
"157" "We  did not anticipate this lack of change. However, it can be understood in the  following  way .  In NI, since V cannot condition their behavior, the proportion  V  challenging  directly  determines the proportion  of groups  in status quo.  In the information treatments, since V can and do condition their behavior, the distribution of R toughness matters for determining the outcomes. In these treatments, V challeng e weak-looking R most of the time. Since most  R obtain low unvei led grades—88% obtain a C or B (170/194 )—lower-grade R are over-represented in the calculation of outcomes. This means that the R that V actually face for determining outcomes are challenged at a high rate  and so status quo is lower than what would be expected by looking at average challenging alone."
"158" "Exploitation increases . Exploitation increases in the information treatments : i t is 29.2%  (s.d.=6.1%)  in NI, 42.3%  (s.d.=8.0%)  in S, and 41.3%  (s.d.=7.3%)  in s+S  ( Figure  5 )."
"159" "Fighting decreases . Fewer subjects  fight when there is information:   50.0% (s.d.=5.2%) of groups fight  in the NI treatment while  36.5% (s.d.= 7.6%) and  33.7% (s.d.=6.2%) fight,  respectively, in the S and the s+S treatments   ( Figure  5 ) ."

"203" "Fighting between equal and unequal grades"
"204" "There is a possible exception to our finding that information reduces fighting. As the animal behavior literature argues, when individuals are of a similar toughness information cannot establish who will win and so fighting is likelier to emerge  (Krebs and Davies 1993) . Similarly, Roger Gould  (2003)  posited that violence is most likely to occur between people who are comparable in social rank, for instance among employees rather than between employees and bosses."
"205" "In our setting, both ideas imply that  fighting should decrease less when V and R are of the same grade . When signs and signals cannot solve a deadlock, force is the only way to determine who gets the resources. While this conjecture is only partially drawn from the model,  it is intuitive and well-established in the animal kingdom so we check for it here."
"206" "To establish whether subjects are of an equal grade or not,"
"207" "in the S treatment, the unveiled grades of V and R because unveiled grades are all that V observe about R; and"
"208" "in the s+S treatment, both their veiled and unveiled grades, for V observe both the sign and signal of R."
"209" "We assign no equal or unequal grades matches in the NI treatment because V know nothing about the grades of R, so the correct term of comparison is the overall proportion fighting in NI."
"210" "W e use  the same simulations as for calculating outcomes to determine the proportion of equal and unequal toughness groups fighting in each treatment.  We  find little support for different treatment effects among equal and unequal subjects.  Remember that the simulated term of comparison in NI is 50 .0 % of subjects who fight (s.d.=5 .2 %). A mong  equal grade V and R, there is a 12.9 % drop in fighting in S (37 .1 %, s.d.=12 .0 %) and 14.5 % drop in s+S (36.5 %, s.d.=16.7 %). Among  those  of dissimilar grades ,  the greater reduction is confirmed but the difference  is small : fighting drops by 15.3%  in  S and by 17 .1%  in s+S (to 35.7%, s.d.=12.6%, and to 32.9 % , s.d. =8 .0 %, respectively)."
"211" "Overconfidence as an alternative explanation"
"212" "A possible psychological explanation of our findings could arise from overconfidence. Loosely put, a cognitive bias of overconfidence predisposes people towards appraising their abilities or probabilities of success as higher than what they are in reality  (Kahneman 2011, 255–65) . A much-cited example of this is the finding that 93% of drivers, in one US survey, report that they are more skillful than the average   (Svenson 1981) ."
"213" "In our context, one may posit that people who know less about others’ sitting abilities are the ones who are the most overconfident about their own. This would mean that V challenge more and R resist more in the NI treatment, and, that fewer subjects end in status quo and exploita tion, and more subjects fight."
"214" "We can test this alternative explanation by comparing two measures of self-reported beliefs across the treatments. When playing as V, subjects were asked to report how probable they thought that they would beat the R they were facing in a sit-off (from 0% to 100%). And, when playing as R, subjects were asked to think of 100 people in the experiment and report how many they thought they would beat (from 0 to 100). If overconfidence were to drive our results, we would expect subjects to be more confident, as both V and R, in the NI treatment."
"215" "Contrary to what the overconfidence hypothesis predicts, we find no differences in subjects’ beliefs across the treatments. The beliefs of V about their probability of beating R remains constant (54.6% in NI, 50.6% in S, 50.0% in s+S; NI vs. S: b=-3.96, s.e.=3.85, p=0.304; NI vs. s+S: b=-4.60, s.e.=3.97, p=0.248) ( Table A 6 ). Likewise, the beliefs of R remain constant (53.6% in NI, 50.7% in S, and 49.1% in s+S; NI vs. S: b=-2.84, s.e.=5.00, p=0.571; NI vs. s+S: b=-4.44, s.e.=4.61, p=0.337) ( Table A 6 ). This suggests that our results are not driven by overconfidence but by information’s effect on strategic decision-making."
"216" "Signaling  and counter- signaling  hypotheses"
"217" "Finally, w e consider whether our data support the predictions of  signaling  or counter- signaling  theory. Consistent with  signaling  theory and H3, we find that veiled sit-times (our measure of toughness) and unveiled sit-times (R signal) are strongly positively correlated in the S and s+S treatments ( S: r=0.48, p<0.001; s+S: r=0.63, p<0.001 ). R who obtain higher veiled grades in both the  S treatment and the s+S treatment also  wall sit  for longer when unveiled   ( Table A 7 ) .  Additionally, we  find no evidence in the s+S treatment that the toughest R signal les s than intermediate toughness R  ( Table A 7 ).  A grade R signal more than B grade R (b=29.17, s.e.=17.17, p=0.094).  Thus, H4, the counter- signaling  prediction is not supported."
"218" "Conclusions"
"219" "In this paper  we investigate   experimentally  the links between interpersonal conflict and information about individuals’ relative toughnes s . We use   a sequential game that capture s   the essence of  a typical prison interaction in  which fighting may occur ."
"220" "Our  game has two players,  whom we dubbed  veterans (V) and rookies (R) .  V decide first whether to ignore or try to  exploit   R . If V ignore, this maintains the status quo, the outcome R  prefer  over all others . If V challenge R, R decide whether to yield  or resist . If R yield, this leads to exploitation ,  the outcome V  prefer  over all others . If R resist a fight ensues. Losers get nothing  and wish they had either not challenged or yielded , but winners pay  the cost of fighting  too  and gain less than in their preferred outcome. In the aggregate, f ights imply an efficiency loss  and potentially pain ."
"221" "Unlike  prior experiments on conflict, which  model  fights  with  only  monetary  payoffs  or rely on self-reported experience of fighting,  we  represent fighting  using  a competitive  wall sit . Similar to a real fight,  subjects participate  in a competitive  wall sit , in which they  potentially incur pain (albeit non- harmful) and  their chances of winning it   are  partly determined by toughness.  We find that how long subjects maintain the  wall sit  position is  correlated with   four other indicators of toughness which we  also  gathered :  self-reported  fitness and  pain resistance, body mass index, and the  ‘ testosterone ’   ratio between the length of 2 nd  digit and that of the 4 th  digit.  These correlations validate our  assumption   that  wall sit ting captures attributes of toughness that are present in real fighting."
"222" "As for information,  subjects create  both  signs and strateg ic signals of their toughness  by  perform ing a   wall sit .  We give players the oppo rtunity to intentionally signal   their toughness by engaging in a  wall sit  prior to playing the game. They are told that afterwards they will be playing the game and that when they play as R the timing they achieve in this  wall sit  will be reported to V with whom they will be matched (‘unveiled’). Since however in many real-life situations some exogenous information is known about R’s toughness prior to them engaging in purposive  signaling , for instance the scars on their face or what crime they are jailed for, we also give players the opportunity to  wall sit  for money  before  telling them  that the game follows (‘veiled’). This creates a ‘natural’  rather than a strategic sign of their toughness. This sign is noisy for it measures the desire to earn as well as resilience, and we make it a little noisier artificially."
"223" "Wall sit ting  allows  subjects  to  generate credible  signs and signals   since   this exercise   is a hard-to-fake indicator  of toughness.  Indeed, w e find that in the case of a fight, the player with the longer veiled  wall sit  time wins in 72% of cases, while the player with the longer unveiled  wall sit  time wins every single fight. This shows that wall sit times  report highly reliable  information, and furthermore that signals are more accurate than signs."
"224" "I n contrast to most  signaling   experiments  (but see Fehrler and Przepiorka 2013; Gambetta and Przepiorka 2014; Gambetta and Székely 2014) , subjects in our setting reveal their type; we do not exogenously allocate their toughness. This may lend itself to more natural in-game  behavior  and  higher external validity  because people who really are tougher play in the ‘tough guy’ role  and because fighting in our experiment, like in reality, incurs some pain."
"225" "We add to the experimental literature testing signaling theory w ith  our  unusual  wall sit  method    of toughness ranking and signal creation.  Signaling theory’s  prediction—that higher quality senders signal more than lower quality senders, is borne out in our data. Conversely, the prediction of  the more nuanced and complex  countersignaling theory that intermediate quality senders signal most ,  does not find support. Despite the setup of our  experiment , which should  be the ideal environment for  the  emergence of counter-signaling, we do not find evidence of it. Perhaps the experimental lab is not the right environment in which to detect this behavior and subtle real-world qualitative investigations would be more able to identify countersignaling."
"226" "In terms of players’ decision,  our  hypotheses , which   emerge from  a model  described  in the appendix,  are  that  (1)  informed  V challenge less frequently and  (2)  R yield with the same or greater frequency  than they do when playing the game uninformed .  These imply, i n terms of outcomes, that  with information the frequency of  status quo increases and that of  exploitation  either stays the same or increases .  Most importantly, it follows that with information fights decrease."
"227" "When we look at the  results , w e find as predicted  that  V challenge less  frequently in the treatment  with information than in the control in which subjects play without  knowing  R’s grade. We also find that w ith  information resisting by R decreases ,  though the difference is not significant.  As for   outcomes ,   we show that status quo  remains the same , and that exploitation increases in the information treatments."
"228" "Above all, we find that  f ewer subjects  end up in a  fight when inform ed .  Interestingly, we also find  some  evidence that the decrease is driven more by the  interactions  of players with unequal grades  than with equal grades — the latter fighting frequency diminishes  a little  less than the former when information is  given ."
"229" "Overall, the increase in  the frequency of the  status quo indicates that R are better off when information about their  toughness  is transmitted to V , who then are more careful to challenge .  The small increase in  exploitation indicates that  R  too  are more careful to resist when challenged, and that thus  V  benefit  from   information  on R’s toughness , at least they do not lose ."
"230" "Since w e manage to rule out overconfidence as an alternative explanation of our results, we  can  therefore  safely  believe that it is indeed information that causes them. T he  conclusion  is thus  that if credible information about individuals’ toughness circulates well in situations in which fighting is likely to erupt, fighting should decrease and ,  to varying extent ,  everyone should be better off ,    whether they would be winners or losers in fights.  Even would-be winners gain by not fighting because fighting implies the risk of injury."
"231" "We also find that some credible information is sufficient to change actions and outcomes.  This is clear for actions since  information  in both treatments  reduces challenging to a similar extent: challenging is 66% in S and 69% in s+S.  Simulations likewise show that  fighting in the information treatments is substantively similar  ( 36 %  in S  and 34% in s+S )  but different to the no information treatment in which 50% of subject fight. Thus, this suggests that some level of credible information is sufficient to reduce challenging and conflict."
"232" "While the focus of our paper has been on fighting in prisons, since prisoners  frequently  face the interaction we test and  do so  under extreme payoffs ,  and  wall sit ting measures toughness and realistically models fighting, our findings may apply to a broader context. They may apply directly to other domains in which fights can erupt such as schools and the military, and indirectly to those  contexts in which conflicts occur: employees jockeying for a promotion, academics competing for influence, and politicians debating for votes.  Further work should be conducted to test the generalizability of our findings and whether modifications in the experimental setup substantively affect the results."

"691" "Now consider  G2 . This game  is identical to  G1  except in one respect:  Veterans  now  observe the signs and signals of the Rookies which allows them to infer  whether  Rookies are  high, medium, or low type— R ookies  still do not know the type of  Veterans  ( Figure S2 ) .   Rookies know that Veterans know Rookie’s type."
"692" "A strategy profile therefore now consists of 12 actions. Each type of  Veteran  takes an action against each different type of Rookie (thus 3*3 actions) and each Rookie type makes a single action against all  Veteran  (3 actions)."
"693" "Before searching for equilibria, we simplify the strategy space using iterative deletion of strictly dominated strategies:"
"694" "For  V A  against R C  and R B ,  c  strictly dominates  i .  If R C  or R B  choose to  y ,  V A  gains 10 from  c  and 3 from  i . If R C  or R B  decide to  R  then  V A  gains 6 by  c  (due to subsequently winning in a fight) and 3 from  i ."
"695" "c  for  V B  against R C  strictly dominates  i . If R C  decides to  y ,  V B  gains 10 by  c  and 3 by  i . If R C  chooses to  r ,  V B  gains 6 from  c  and 3 from  i ."
"696" "y  for R C  strictly dominates  r  in all strategy profiles in which there is some proportion > 0 of  V A  and  V B  who  c  R C . When the proportion of  V A  and/or  V B  who  c  R C  is > 0, then R C  receives 3 from  y  and < 3 from  r , since, R C  always loses in a fight with  V A  and  V B . By proposition 1 and/or 2 this must be the case in equilibrium."
"697" "Since proposition 3,  V C  strictly prefers to  c  R C  than to  i  R C  (because 10>3)."
"698" "Following the elimination of the above strategies, we  use the same approach as in  G1 .  When calculating the expected uti lities, we set the beliefs of R  to be consistent with the strategy of  V , therefore the  pure strategy NE we identify are also PBE."
