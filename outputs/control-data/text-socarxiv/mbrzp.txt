"11" "Abstract"
"12" "D ifferences  in  low birth weight incidence   ( LBW) by race and place   are long-standing ,  often  embedded in  enduring  social  ecologies   where  insufficient  health  resources  are paired with   an array  of  risk  factors .   Local  or  group -specific  economic  resources   are known to  be   a   fundamental  contributor   to   these  social ecologies , yet  few studies have  investigated  how  within- area   changing economic conditions   are  link ed  to birth outcomes.   T his study   examines   county -level   change  in  median income and  black-white income  differences   as predictors of   LBW incidence  and LBW  racial disparities .   Time-varying county prevalence and black-white differences in maternal sociodemographic and health  risk  factors  (e.g., non-marital childbearing, smoking during pregnancy) are considered as explanations for income estimates.  Data  co me  from  U.S.  birth records  for  approximately 24.8 million non- Hispanic black and white mothers with a singleton live birth (1992-2014).    Records were aggregated  in  three-year county-period meas urements for  the  732  counties  meeting eligibility requirements .    Based on  county by period fixed effects models, a $ 10 ,000 increase in county median income was associated with a reduction in LBW incidence of  2 .7  per 1000   live births , and in the black-white LBW gap by  5.6  per 1000.   T ime-varying  county  ma ternal sociodemographic  and health  risks  attenuated the link betwee n median income and LBW by 72%  and 31%, respectively , but  not the association   between median income  and the racial LBW gap .   Contrary to  our hypothesi s,  conditioning on median income change s ,  a widening racial income  differ e nce  was associated with a smaller black-white  LBW  gap  (a finding  explored in post hoc analyses ) .   Our results  suggest that , if successful in raising median income, local   government efforts to stimulate economic growth and employment opportunities are likely to  reduce   both   population  incidence and black-white  differences  in LBW ."
"13" "S ubstantial   variation  in  adverse   birth outcomes ( e.g .,  low birth weight, infant mortality)  exists  between counties and cities  in the United States   (Kramer and Hogue, 2008; Thompson et al., 2005) .   I n one study,  for instance,  l ow birth weight  incidence  (LBW; <2500 g.)   had a nearly three-fold range between   multi-county areas— influenced by  median income  levels  and prevalence of behavioral health risks   (Thompson et al., 2005) .   D isparities in birth outcomes between  black/ African  and white  American s  also  vary  significantly   across  counties   (Kramer and Hogue, 2008; Rossen et al., 2016) , with the black : white infant mortality rat io   ranging  from 1.5 to 4.8.   The   patterning of  LBW  has   implications for lifelong  geographic and racial  dispari ties in health and well-being; i.e.,  in addition to increased risk of   neonatal  mortality, infants born LBW,  particularly  below 1500 grams,  are at higher risk of impaired cognitive functioning, low academic achievement, and cardiovascular disease  (Aarnoudse-Moens et al., 2009; Barker, 2006) .   Understanding the  sources of  place-based  differences in LBW risk  and LBW racial disparities  is thus an important step to reducing  broader  health  and socioeconomic  inequities."
"14" "D ifferences in  material  and social  resources represent  key contributor s  to the  unequal r ate  of  adverse birth outcomes between places  and  to the  inequities  between groups within places  (Krieger et al., 2008; Siddiqi et al., 2016) .  For example, based on  an aggregate measure of socioeconomic deprivation, the least advantaged quintile of counties  have persistently had  between 40 -60% higher infant mortality  relative to the most advantaged quintile  (Singh and Kogan, 2007) .   This  link between place-based  socio economic measures and  birth outcomes  is robust, established  through numerous analytic approaches  and  in multiple contexts  (Blumenshine et al., 2010; Krieger et al., 2008; Siddiqi et al., 2016) .   Consistent with fundamental cause theory,  individual  socioeconomic  position  and  the collective  social  position of  groups   is likely to  influence  health and pregnancy outcomes   by shaping  access to an array of flexible health  resources—e.g., health  information , quality healthcare,  stress coping resources  and behaviors , and stable social connections  (Phelan et al., 2010) .  Such diverse health resources have broad potential to spill into the fertility patterns and health status of women of childbearing age  (Feldman et al., 2000; Gortmaker and Wise, 1997; Grote et al., 2010; Kramer et al., 2000) ."
"15" "Residential segregation patterns and differences in labor market access further ensure the division of  material and social  r esources  by  racial group  within places  (Massey, 2001; Williams and Collins, 2001) .   Such resource inequities likely influence  racial   disparities in  perinatal outcomes , with more segregated and unequal places  tending to have  excess risk of  adverse birth outcomes and infant mortality  among black infants   (Mehra et al., 2017; Wallace et al., 2017) .   Given that  socioeconomic disadvantages are acutely clustered in  many  predominantly black communities (e.g., high residential isolation, few economic opportunities, high crime exposure)  (Sampson, 2012; Wilson, 2012) , and that racial group is a powerful  determinant of social position   independent of economic status  (Williams and Sternthal, 2010) , pathways to high pregnancy risk  for black  women  are numerous  and likely entrenched  in soci oeconomic  conditions .   E ven as clinical advancements  are  made to improve survival of low birth weight infants, black mothers   continue to be exposed to social  ecologies  that  contribute  both  to   disproportionate  low birth weight risk and  to poorer access to the best clinical services   (Gortmaker and Wise, 1997; Howell et al., 2018) ."
"16" "The  collective socioeconomic conditions  of  cities/counties and  resources of  racial groups  within places  nonetheless   rise and fall, even if  rank  differences  are  generally  stable   (Singh, 2003) .   Numerous studies  have  utilize d  cyclical changes in the unemployment rate  to understand the association  of macro-economic conditions  with adverse birth outcomes, yet findin gs from this research have shown  both  procyclical and countercyclical effects  (Noelke et al., 2019; Orsini  and Avendano, 2015; Schempf and Decker, 2010) .  O ne reason for mixed findings  is the   timing of exposure ,   such that  unemployment  during  pre-conception  reduce s  fertility among women of low socioeconomic status (leading to better  population  birth outcomes) while higher unemployment early in gestation   increases premature and low birthweight risk  (Noelke et al., 2019) .   L ittle extant research, however, has sought to understand how  place-specific  changes in  income  influence adv erse birth outcomes,  with relevant studies   generally  relying  on cross-sectional designs  (Blumenshine et al., 2010; Krieger et al., 2008; Thompson et al., 2005) .    Pertinent here  are findings indicating that state-level  increases  in median income ,   relative to poverty, education, and unemployment,  may be  more  predictive of  declines in  infant mortality  (Siddiqi et al., 2016) .   A rea median income represents a n appropriate focus  for scientific inquiry   as  a  more  direct measure of financial  or material  resources  relative to  other  socioeconomic indicators.   For example, u nemployment  rates,  suggest not only a decline in financial resources but  also  decreases in  social  status,  increased  eligibility for  health-promoting public services (e.g., the  Special Supplemental Nutrition Program  for Women, Infants, and Children  and Medicaid) , and available time for health behaviors and prenatal care   (Menclova, 2013) .  Similarly ,  measures of  educational  attainment   capture   social  status,  social norms , and propensity to engage in many healthful behaviors   (Shavers, 2007) .   In sum, investigating m edian income   changes  highlights  the important role of  individual and collective financial resources  for population health ."
"17" "Social and Health  Mediating  Processes"
"18" "Two broad factors may  explain  the  influence of  county median income  on LBW —namely,  prevalence of maternal  sociodemographic and health  risk factors .   E conomically disadvantaged areas  tend to have  a higher prevalence of nonmarital childbearing, teenage pregnancy, and births to mothers without a high school education  (Romero, 2016; Shattuck and  Kreider, 2008; Wertheimer et al., 2000) , each of which is  linked with elevated LBW risk  (Chen et al., 2007; Mathews and MacDorman, 2013; Raatikainen et al., 2005) .   If rising   household income  influence s  rates of positive  life course  outcomes (e.g., educational attainment, reduced teen pregnancy),  declines in adverse  birth outcomes  are likely to ensue .   Moreover , fertility patterns within population groups (e.g., mothers with low educational attainment)  may  be differentially  responsive to   increases in well-paying employment  opportunities, such  that the risk profiles of  birthing  mothers (i.e., education level, marital status, age) and their partners covary with economic cycles  (Colen et al., 2006; Orsini and Avendano, 2015) .   For example, black teenagers (but not white) have been found to delay childbearing as a result of increased employment opportunities  (Colen et al., 2006) ."
"19" "Although s ubstantial black-white differences in  maternal education,  nonm arital childbearing, and teenage pregnancy are present , racial  differences  in LBW risk exist independent of  these  maternal  sociodemographic characteristics   (Bennett, 1992; DuPlessis et al., 1997; Jaffee and Perloff, 2003) .   Moreover,  birth risks linked with these maternal characteristics may be smaller for Black relative to White women   (Braveman et al., 2015; Rich-Edwards et al., 2003) .   A ggregate estimates of  racial differences in s ociodemographic risk categories , however,  may serve as proxies for  local inequities in  access to  educational and  community resources , residential segregation, and mass incarceration , among other indicators of social disadvantage   (Carlson et al., 2014; Charles and Luoh, 2010; Chetty et al., 2018; Wilson, 2012) .    Racial differences in nonmarital childbearing and teen pregnancy  ha ve  decreased  in recent  decades , trends that have the potential to  reduce  black-white  differences  in birth outcomes  (Romero, 2016; Sweeney and Raley, 2014) ."
"20" "A  second potential explanation for the effects of rising median income on declining LBW incidence is via reduced maternal health risks.   S moking during  gestation ,  diet , and  health  care are three  maternal  health  factors ,  influenced by economic contexts , that   affect  fetal growth and gestational length  (Kramer et al., 2000) .   Rising household  income , for instance,   may  afford better access to a nutritionally  healthy  diet ,  reduce  diet- or smoking-related stress coping, and ease  financial barriers   to obtaining  quality prenatal care   (Cynthia G Colen et al., 2006; Downe et al., 2009; Kramer et al., 2011) .     As an example, LBW   rates  declined among unmarried black mothers with low education during the  1990s economic boom , a finding explained by decreasing smoking rates and improved prenatal care (independent of unemployment)  (Schempf and Decker, 2010) .   Moreover,  beyond individual risks,  higher collective income can attract private investments in community amenities that influence health behaviors (e.g., grocery stores, medical clinics),  positively impact  social norms around diet   and smoking, and reduce various forms of neighborhood-based stress (e.g., crime, disorder)  (Pickett et al., 2002) .   Aggregate or a rea-level  economic disadvantage   has been  associated  with higher prevalence of  maternal smoking  during pregnancy , insufficient gestational weight gain, and inadequate prenatal care   (DeFranco et al., 2008; Messer et al., 2012; Vinikoor-Imler et al., 2011) ."
"21" "In addition, b lack-white  difference s  in insufficient gestational weight gain and inadequate prenatal care are substantial   (Gadson et al., 2017; Leonard et al., 2017) .   Place-based  variation  in these racial differences  suggest s   the existence of inequities  in  the underlying social determinants   (Laraia et al., 2007; Rossin-Slater, 2013; Tabet et al., 2017) .  Yet ,   sparse prior  research has focused on area-level black-white  differences  in either insufficient gestational weight gain or inadequate prenatal care  (for an example in the American Indian population, see Johnson et al., 2010) .  With regards to maternal smoking, black  mothers are less likely to smoke during  pregnancy relative to whites  (Ventura et al., 2003) .  However , differences in smoking rates for black and white women vary by state   and race-specific patterns of geographic variations in maternal smoking are largely independent from each other  (Osypuk et al., 2006) ."
"22" "Current study"
"23" "The  primary aims of the current study are  (1)   to  estimate  the association between within county  changes  in median household income  and  LBW incidence ; and (2)   to  examine  within county  changes  in median income and racial income differences as predictors of black-white disparities in LBW.   T he present study is  among the first  to estimate  temporal  links between county  income  characteristics and adverse birth outcomes.    The focus on race-specific median income and county black-white disparities is particularly  important  given the racial segregation of economic  resources and labor market access .   In addition, area prevalence of maternal sociodemographic and health risk factors, and black-white differences in these factors, are modeled as explanations for the  association  between income variables and LBW outcomes."
"24" "Methods"
"25" "Data"
"26" "To  test  study hypotheses, data were derived from multiple sources.  National birth records   from 1992 to 2014,  representing more than 99% of all births and  collected  through  the National Vital Statistics System , were obtained   from  the National Center for Health Statistics .   Data were obtained as a restricted access file that included c ounty FIPS  (Federal Information Processing Standards) codes for individual birth records to allow for merging with county variables  (National Center for Health Statistics, n.d.) .   A nnual estimates of  county  median  household income   were obtained  through the U.S. Census Bureau’s Small Area Income and Poverty Estimates program , and race-specific median household income estimates came from the  Decennial Censuses and American Community Surveys.  C ounty population estima tes by race were obtained  through the Census Bureau  Housing Unit and Population Estimates program ."
"27" "Because of our focus on black-w hite  differences  in LBW rates,  only   births to non-Hispanic black or non-Hispanic white moth ers were included.  The sample was further restricted to s ingle tons  as the causes of LBW are different for  multiple gestation births  (Blickstein, 2004) .  Individual birth records were  aggregated to the  maternal  county  of residence  a nd pooled over three-year periods.   Three-year periods were selected to improve the reliability of measuring both county income variables and low birth weight outcomes.  Moreover, we were interested in longer-term changes in median income rather than year-to-year fluctuations , such that we selected five- year intervals for assessments  (a ssessment periods  are shown in Figure 1 ) .   For each period in the analytic sample,  to increase the reliability of estimates,  counties  needed ≥20  LBW  case   for each racial group, leading to the exclusion of 11527 county-by-period measurements .   The practical effect was that counties in the sample had more than 100 births to black mothers  per  period (and nearly 300 births to white mothers).  Count y-period observations  were excluded  if data were missing  for  county  racial income differences (317  observations); if there was a  high percentage of missing data  (≥40%)  for  individual maternal health items  (396  observations);   or counties had fewer  than two  eligible  periods (82  observations )."
"28" "Eligibility  criteria resulted in 732 counties with  2798 total  county-period  observations.  Because of bias toward inclusion of large counties, observations  still represent  24.76 of  the total  4 1.02  million singleton births to non-Hispanic black (6.76 million births) and non-Hispanic white (18.00) mothers   in assessment periods .   Sample counties were located  throughout  the Southeast and in metropolitan areas across the United States , and they differed in expected ways from excluded counties—namely,  sample counties had a more numerous total population , a  larger black population, and higher median income.  Although raw differences were found in county LBW rate, sample counties did not have higher LBW after adjusting for  racial demographics (i.e., % black) .   Models were fit using less restrictive inclusion criteria:  ten cases of LBW  when modeling county  LBW  rate ( n=27 12  counties with 11 794  county-period observations ) and ten cases of LBW per racial group  and data on racial income differences   when modeling  the black-white LBW gap   ( n= 1115  counties with  4200  county-period observations ) .  The pattern of findings  was similar  with these  less restrictive criteria."
"29" "Measures"
"30" "Birth records.   M aternal and infant factors were assessed from birth records.  For variable s  below , the  county  prevalence of  each criterion within the three-year period  was coded.  Race-specific county prevalence estimates were coded using maternal racial classifications of non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white, from which the absolute gap between black and white mothers or infants was derived."
"31" "Low b irth weight .   Birth weight  is  directly assessed and  reliably recorded  on birth  records  (Northam and Knapp, 2006) .  Birth weights  of less than  2500 grams  were coded as  LBW ,  from which  c ounty  LBW incidence   rate  was computed  ( LBW cases  /  total  live  births  with birth weight  data ) .   The  black-white  gap in  LBW is  represented by the absolute difference  in county-specific LBW rates for black and white infants .    C ounty very low birth weight   (VLBW)  incidence  (<1500 g.) and the associated black-white gap were  considered in  supplemental analyses."
"32" "Maternal s ociodemographic characteristics .  Socioeconomic position was assessed using maternal education  (Singh and Kogan, 2007) .    A revised birth certificate form was introduced in 2003 that included a change in the assessment of maternal education from the number of years of schooling completed to educational credentials.  To improve c onformity across data periods, low  maternal educational attainment was coded as  completion of 4 years of high school or less (for the 1989 form) and high school graduate or GED  or  less (for the 2003 form), from which county prevalence was computed.   Marital status at time of birth (married, unmarried) was  used to code  prevalence of nonmarital childbearing  (Osterman et al., 2015) .  Maternal age was coded to represent the prevalence of teenage pregnancy (age ≤ 18 y.) and advanced maternal age pregnancy (age ≥ 35 y.)  (Fall et al., 2015) .   A dvanced age pregnancies  are  linked with reduced risk of intrauterine fetal growth restriction but not premature births, and  are  more common among socioeconomically advantaged mothers  (Kenny et al., 2013) ."
"33" "Maternal  health characteristics .   Prevalence of m aternal smoking or tobacco use during pregnancy was coded  from  a dichotomous variable (yes/no)  (Ventura et al., 2003) .   Insufficient g estational weight gain  was coded based on Institute of Medicine  recommendations  (Institute of Medicine, 2010) .  Although recommendations are determined by pre-pregnancy weight status,  weight status was  not avai lable for the majority of years.  We thus selected  a conservative cutoff using  recommendations for  overweight  status   adjusted for gestational length;  i.e.,  less than 15 lbs or the equivalent of gaining  < .484 lb s/week after  gestational week 9   (CDC, 2016) .   P revalence of inadequate prenatal care was coded if care was initiated after 4 months or if  < 50% of recommended visits   were received  for  gestational age at birth , based on the Adequacy of Prenatal Care Utilization Index  (Kotelchuck, 1994) ."
"34" "County economic and  demographic  data .   County  median  h ousehold income  estimates  for 1993, 1997-1999, 2002-2004, 2007-2009, and 2012-2014  were available from the  Census Bureau , based on  data from administrative tax records, government transfers, decennial Census statistics, and  the  Current Population Survey or  American Community Survey   (Bell et al., 2007) .    Race-specific county median household income estimates were measured for black and white  households during the 1990 and 2000 Decennial Censuses, and via the American Community Survey using 2005, 2007-2009 three-year estimate, and 2012-2014 waves.  Estimates for 1992 and 1998 median income for black and white households were then derived from 1990 and 2000 Censuses as weighted averages, and for  2003  from the 2000 Census and 2005 American Community Survey.  Due to high missing data f or one-year estimates in 2012-2 014 (three-year estimates were not  available for these years ), missing values were imputed using the 2011-2013 three-year estimate.  The  absolute  racial income gap was computed at each period as  median income for black households subtracting   median income  for  white  households , with  more negative  values indicating a  larger  black   disadvantage .   I ncome estimates were adjusted to 2015 dollars using the Consumer Price Index.  Note that median income estimates from the American Community Survey are based on reports of household income in the last 12 months collected throughout the year, such that Figure 1 refers to approximate years."
"35" "Population estimates by racial group are  publicly available  as  intercensal and postcensal estimates , and the midpoint of each period was selected: 1993, 1998, 2003, 2008, and 2013.  Black density was coded as t he percent of  total county  residen ts categorized as non-Hispanic b lack .  Population change between periods was measured as: (total population (period)  - total population (period - 1)  ) / total population (period - 1) .  Total population in 1988 was used to compute population change for 1993."
"36" "Plan of  A nalysis"
"37" "C ounty by period fixed effect linear regression models  were used  to test hypothesized associations.  Such models remove variance due to time-invariant between county differences—in effect, considering e ach county as its own control.    P eriod  fixed effects  were included to   adjust  for   national time trends in  LBW rates.  Models were estimated  in Stata 14.2  using the xtreg  command with the fe vce(robust) options ;  vce(robust) uses the Huber/White sandwich estimator to report standard errors that are robust to serial correlation and heteroskedasticity  (Stock and Watson, 2008) ."
"38" "A series of models was conducted for each LBW outcome (county  LBW  incidence per 100 births, and the black-white gap in LBW).  First, the association between median income and county LBW incidence was estimated after adjusting for county and  period  fixed effects, and time-varying black density and population change (Model 1a). Specifically, the following model was fit:  ,  where    is  LBW incidence  at period t in county i;   is the time-invariant county effect;   refers to the  coefficient for  median household income ,    is  the  vector of time-varying covariates;   is a vector representing period dummy variables; and   is the error for period t in county i.   Next, t he following b locks of covariates were added independently: low maternal education, n onmarital childbearing , teenage pregnancy, and advanced age pregnancy (Model 1b); and maternal smoking during pregnancy, insufficient gestational weight gain, and inadequate prenatal care (Model 1c).   A ll covariates  were modeled   simultaneously  in Model 1d .   A similar progression of models was used for  county  black-white differences in LBW , the exception being that black-white difference in median income was added as a predictor in Model 2b before the explanatory covariates were added in Models 2c-2e."
"39" "Numerous  alternative specifications and  s upplemental models were  conducted .   Details of relevant measures are included in supplemental material.   First, o utlier effects were tested by refitting models that exclude d one period at a time.  Second, i n place of absolute  LBW  differences, LBW incidence among black infants was modeled as the outcome  with  white LBW incidence  included in the regression .    Third ,  to disaggregate  median  income from household size   and government assistance , median earnings by sex for black and white adults (≥16 years) with full-time, year-round employment were examined in place of median household income and racial income differences (only  data for the final three periods  were available).  Fourth,  post-hoc analyses  considered  labor market factors  (e.g., income inequality, unemployment, employment by industry)  that could account for our unexpected finding concerning the black-white income gap.   Finally,  c ounty VLBW incidence and the county black-white VLBW gap were   modeled  as  supplemental  outcome s —the rationale being that VLBW is a much stronger predictor of infant mortality and developmental delays ."
"40" "Results"
"41" "T he mean county population  across  study periods  was  just over  300,000 (SD = 5 29,180 ) with a range of approximately 18,000 to  10  million.  On average, 19. 6  percent of county residents were characterized  as non-Hispanic black (SD = 14.4 ; range  =  0.8 - 78.9 %).  County median household income  showed wide variation across sample counties  (mean = $5 2,750 , SD = $14, 309 ; range  =  $2 5,820- 1 23,820 ).  Additional descriptives , including within county standard deviations,  are shown separately for white and black  samples  in Table 1.   Partial c orrelations  with residualized county and period fixed effects  are shown in Table  S1 of the Supplemental M aterial , and  indicate within county relationships irrespective of national time trends .   Relationships  w ere consistent with hypotheses —the exception being   the  correlation  between black-white differences in income and LBW   ( r = .07 ; smaller black-white income difference s being correlated with increasing  racial LBW differences ).    As a comparison, Table S 2  in  Supplemental M aterial   shows correlations  between  county  means ,  and   between  county  black-white differences in income and LBW are correlated  as expected  ( r =- .29)."
"42" "County Low Birth Weight Incidence"
"43" "M odel results  with  county LBW incidence  per 100 live births  as the outcome are depicted in Table  2.   Adjusting for county and period fixed effects, total population change, and black density,  within county changes  in median household income were inversely associated with LBW incidence  (Model 1a) .  Specifically, a $ 10, 000 increase in median income was linked to  2 .7  few er cases of LBW per 1000 births ; i.e.,   1 SD increase in  median  income  is associated with  .12 SD  decrease in LBW  (within county SD units) .   A djust ing  for prevalence of maternal sociodemographic risks  (Model 1b) , the association between  county  median income and LBW incidence was attenuated by 72% and became non-significant.  Post-hoc  tests  indicated that nonmarital childbearing was the key  explanatory  covariate, reducing the  income – LBW association by 59% .   Adjustment for  maternal health risks  (Model 1c)  attenuated t he link between county median income and LBW incidence by 31% but  it  remained significant ( p < .001)."

An  increase in median household income  of $10,000  was  estimated to reduce the racial gap in LBW by  5.6   cases per 1000 births; s tated differently,  1 SD unit increase in median household income was linked with a reduction of .12 SD units in the racial LBW gap."
"46" "B lack-white difference  in county median income was added in Model 2b.  Contrary to  our  hypothes i s,  when adjusting for county median income,  a   shrinking  racial income gap   of $10 ,000 was associated with a growing  black-white di fference  in LBW  of   2.6  cases per 1000  births  (i.e.,  1 SD  decrease  in the  income gap  is  linked  with  .07 SD  increase  in the racial LBW gap ) .   County  racial differences in  the   prevalence of maternal  sociodemographic characteristics and health risks  were included in   Models 2c and 2d , respectively.   The m edian income  estimate was  largely independent of racial differences in maternal risks (e.g., attenuated by 12%  when adjusting for  sociodemographic  characteristics ).   R acial differences in  maternal health risks reduced the  black-white  income gap estimate by 17%  (Model 2d) ; the attenuation of  this estimate arises mostly from B-W differences in  smoking during  pregnancy   decreasing   as  the racial income gap  shrinks  (i.e., the racial gap in smoking favors  black mothers   to a lesser degree )."
"47" "Alternative specifications.  To probe the  association between a widening racial income gap and shrinking B-W LBW difference,  alternative model specifications were examined.     Potential  undue influence by outlier periods  was tested by refitting  Model 2b  but  removing one period at a time.  Model estimates were similar to those in Table 3: median income estimates ranged from -.44 to -.60, and B-W income gap estimates ranged from .23 to .33. Thus, outlier periods were not responsible for the unexpected finding for the racial income gap."
"48" "Change in  the  b lack-white  difference in median household  income  is ambiguous and could  stem from  change  in either black or whit e median income levels, or from shifts in household composition (i.e., rate of two-earner households, sex-specific shifts in median income).  Thus,  w e  tested   c ounty black median income  in place of the racial income gap   as a predictor of B-W LBW differences .   Model f indings  indicat ed  that ,   once conditioning for the population-wide median income,  an increase  in  Black  median   income   was  associated with a wider  black-white gap in LBW ."
"49" "In addition, we m odel ed  median earnings  for full-time, year-round employment  by  race and sex  ( these data were only available  by race-sex groups  for  the final three periods , resulting in  a sample of   n  =  723 counties with 1628  county-period  observations).    Model results indicated that  female median earnings for either race  were  significant predictors of black -white  LBW  differences , but not male median earnings.   An  increase in median earnings of $ 10 ,000 for black females was  estimated to reduce the racial gap by   3.5  fewer  cases per 1000  ( p =.0 4 4), whereas a  similar increase  for white females was associated with  a smaller racial gap of 7.7   cases  ( p =.013) .   These results are counter to findings that increases in black median household income are associated with  larger black-white LBW differences .   Results  may  suggest the greater importance of female  relative to male  wages as a predictor of  positive  Black  birth outcomes or could be  influenced by  confounding labor market factors  where median income growth for Black males but not females is  tied to labor  conditions with adverse health effects."
"50" "Thus, t o consider labor market factors  (e.g., income inequality, employment and wages by industry)  that  are  associated with the racial income gap and  could  explain counterintuitive associations with the B-W gap in LBW , a series of post-hoc analyses were  conducted  and are described in  S upplemental  M aterial.   Results suggested that  increases in employment and wages for goods-producing occupations (e.g., manufacturing) were associated with larger B-W LBW differences and a higher black LBW rate, yet similar  increases for service-producing occupations were associated with shrinking B-W LBW differences and a smaller  Black  LBW rate.   Labor market confounds explained up to one-third  of the  unexpected black median income estimate ."
"51" "Supplemental Models"
"52" "Supplemental analyses were  also  conducted to model  VLBW incidence ( <1500 g.) and the black-white gap in VLBW  as outcomes .  Inclusion criteria were similar to  the main analytic sample  but co unties were required to have only  10 cases of VLBW incidence   per  racial group , leading to a smaller sample of  524  counties and 17 89  observations  (the rationale for the lower  threshold being that other variables would still be reliably measured due to their  higher  prevalence) .   The pattern of findings was similar to models with  L BW outcomes.  In particular, me dian household income  was  associated with VLBW incidence ($ 10,000 increase linked with .64  fewer cases per 1000,  p < .001).  This estimate was attenuated by 53%  and 8%  when adjusting for sociodemographic  and maternal health risks, respectively .  A $ 10 ,000 increase in median household income was estimated to  reduce the black-white gap by  1.31  cases per 1000 ( p =.00 7 ), while a $10 ,000 increase in the black-white income gap was estimated to reduce the black-white VLBW gap b y .76  cases per 1000 ( p =.0 31 ).   C ounty black-white differences in prevalence of sociodemographic  factors explained ~13% of the median income estimate  and maternal health risks  explained ~20% of the black-white income difference estimate ."
"53" "Discussion"
"54" "Reducing low birth weight incidence  and the disproportionate burden experienced by black infants are priorities  in the  U.S.  (Healthy People 2020, 2010) .   We find evidence to suggest that  county   median income  growth   may be  one  important  approach  to reduce  LBW incidence and   shrink  the  black-white  LBW disparity .  Concordant findings  for   VLBW  incidence   demonstrate  the  potential for  rising  median income to  improve   a broader set of  outcomes   (e.g., infant mortality,  developmental  outcomes)   (Boardman et al., 2002; Wise, 1993) .   S pecifically, a $10 ,000 increase in median  income wa s estimated to decrease county incidence  of LBW by 2.7  and VLBW by 0. 6  per 1000;  black-white differences in LBW and VLBW would  shrink by   5.6 and 1.3  cases  per 1000, respectively.  For reference, 201 6  estimates of  LBW and VLBW incidence  are  64.4 and 10.8 per 1000 singleton births,  and  black-white differences  are  67.1 and 18.8 per 1000 live births, respectively  (Martin et al., 2018) ."
"55" "Study  findings are  broadly  consistent with voluminous research identifying benefits of economic resources for  improving  birth outcomes  (Blumenshine et al., 2010; Singh and Kogan, 2007) .    For instance,  cash transfers to low-income households reduce  LBW  incidence  (Hoynes et al., 2015) , while county  median income  is  a strong predictor of infant mortality rates cross-sectionally  (Krieger et al., 2008) .   That within  county increases in median income predicted smaller black-white LBW disparities is consistent with research indicating that growth in state median income  predicts  declining black-white differences in infant mortality  (Siddiqi et al., 2016) , and that affluent counties have smaller disparities in life expectancy by race or income quintile  (Cullen et al., 2012) .   The present study is the first   to our knowledge ,  however , to  examine  county  changes  in  household  median income  as a predictor of   adverse birth  outcomes and ass ociated black-white disparities, providing support   for  the notion that  increasing collective financial resources can reduce LBW risk with large r  benefits for black infants."
"56" "Contrary to  hypotheses , we   found decreases in the black-white income gap  predicted  a widening racial gap in LBW , and vice versa .   Although not hypothesized, we speculate two potential  explanations:  1)  labor markets with growing black-white income differences have accompanying positive health factors that disproportionately benefit black mothers; or 2) diminishing racial  income  differences increase   interracial competition  and associated stress .  Black Americans, on average, face several disadvantages in the labor market, including overrepresentation in the manufacturing industry where employment  has  decreased, greater vulnerability to increases in unemployment, and lower paying employment during a period of rising income inequality  (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018) .  These market changes  would  disproportionately  harm  the median income of black adults while  having  the potential for some unexpected gains  in health .  E.g., the racial income gap may widen with decreases in  manufacturing employment, but the financial challenges may be offset by improvements in birth outcomes from less pollution or physically strenuous labor  (Li et al., 2017; Mozurkewich et al., 2000) .   O ur  post-hoc  findings suggest  a portion  of the link between  widening  black-white  income differences  and   shrinking racial  LBW  disparities  is  from   decreases  in  employment and wages in  goods-producing   industries  and   gains in service-producing industries , and vice versa .  Regarding the second explanation, perceptions  of economic scarcity  may lead to out-group discrimination—e.g., white participants discriminate against and limit  resource allocation  to black Americans   under experimental conditions of scarcity  (Krosch et al., 2017) , and   racial  prejudice   may  rise  during economic downturns   due to perceptions of group threat   (Quillian, 1995) .    Heightened r acial discrimination, in turn, may increase  disparities in adverse birth outcomes  (Giurgescu et al., 2011) .    Such possibilities need to be examined in future research .    Another possibility is that findings are spurious due  to measurement error . However, we tried to minimize measurement error  by including thr e e-year averages where possible, and the validity of black-white income differences was supported by   the expected correlations with  racial differences i n low maternal educati on and nonmarital childbearing ."
"57" "Prior research  provides   some  support for our  unexpected  finding that  disproportionate gains (or  losses ) in Black median income are associated with higher  (or lower)  LBW incidence for Black infants.   For instance , p rior research  finds that  state increases in income inequality—likely corresponding to a widening racial income gap—are linked to declining racial  differences  in infant mortality  (Siddiqi et al., 2016) .   Moreover, b lack median income  does  not explain spatial variation in the rate of very premature births among black infants   beyond overall median income  (Kramer and Hogue, 2008) .    If rising Black median income is associated with higher residence in White neighborhoods or  more frequent interactions with  white colleagues, prior  evidence suggests that adverse  birth  consequences could follow  (Canady et al., 2008; Kothari et al., 2016) .     At the individual level, prior  research has reported weaker associations between socioeconomic position and adverse birth outcomes for black relative to white women  (Braveman et al., 2015; Colen et al., 2006) .   In contrast,   c ross-sectional findings  indicate that  areas with larger black-white economic inequities   have wider racial health disparities   (Cullen et al., 2012; Wallace et al., 2017) , and that racial  socioeconomic  differences may be especially predictive of  excess  small  Black  births in areas with high income inequality  (Wallace et al., 2015) .   Thus , the role of socioeconomic differences i n accounting for black-white disparities in adverse birth outcomes i s complex and  likely dependent on contextual factors such as  area economic resources, employment  opportunities  by industry , racial demographics , race relations ,  and income inequality."
"58" "Another key finding is  that four-fifths of the link between median income and  LBW incidence  was explained by maternal   sociodemographic characteristics, with nonmarital childbearing being an important predictor.   Prior evidence is inconclusive on whether   area-l evel  economic conditions   influence  nonmarital  childbearing  rates .   S ome evidence shows nonmarital fertility  to be procyclical, such as the substantial decline in nonmarital fertility during  the Great Recession  in  states with high unemployment  (Schneider and Gemmill, 2016) .   Other research has found no association between state unemployment (1975- 1999 ) and  nonmarital fertility rates  (Dehejia and Lleras-Muney, 2004) , and recent local e conomic booms   have led to higher   marital and nonmarital fertility  but no  change in  share of nonmarital births  (Kearney and Wilson, 2017) .   In support of our findings , the  cross-sectional  link between area-level economic disadvantage and nonmarital childbearing rates is established  (Shattuck and Kreider, 2008) , and the  secular trend  in nonmarital childbearing  has been most pronounced among economicall y disadvantaged  individuals  (McLanahan and Jacobsen, 2015) .   Inconsistent findings may  partly  be due to the use of median income rather than unemployment,   the latter potentially having positive health sequelae because of its transitory nature and increases in free time for health behaviors  (Dehejia and Lleras-Muney, 2004) .  Additionally , our aim was to understand  longer-term  changes in  median income ,  rather than annual  fluctuations .  Thus, our findings have special relevance for potential processes underlying the development of spatial variation in adverse birth outcomes."
"59" "Despite strengths of the modeling approach (i.e., large number of counties with data over an extended time-period) and novelty of study findings, important limitations exist.  Aggregate data and ecologic models have key limitations  (Morgenstern, 1995) , such as the inability to draw conclusions at the person level.   Our  purpose was not to demonstrate  maternal characteristics  as individual risk factors,  however,  but to consider their utility when measured at the area-level  (especially as explanations for income effects) .  County prevalence estimates indicate  the existence of person-level risks  but also broad ecologic influences on these  factors .  For example, n onmarital childbearing rates potentially serve as a proxy for mult iple contextual variables— levels of economic and health resources, social support and stress exposure, and norms around sexual behavior and family formation  (McLanahan, 2009) .   An additional limitation is that county populations are not static over time.  Estimates of the effects of median income changes do not disentangle contextual effects (i.e., improved local economic conditions) from compositional effects (i.e., in-migration of population with high social and economic capital).   F uture research is  thus  needed to examine LBW incidence of long-term county residents as a function of changing county  median income .  Moreover, irrespective of whether contextual or compositional effects explain the link between shifts in median income and LBW incidence, the  present findings demonstrate that county median income and maternal sociodemographic characteristics are likely contributors to the wide variation in LBW outcomes between counties."
"60" "Conclusion"
"61" "Considerable variation in low birth weight incidence exists between counties as well  as within counties (e.g., by racial group) over time .  Elucidating economic and social predictors of such variation provides insight into policy levers  that could   generate  more equitable  birth  outcomes within counties.   Our  findings show that increases in median household income are linked with  small reductions in  county LBW incidence and black-white disparities in  LBW .   Rising m edian income appear s to  decrease  LBW incidence via changes in sociodemographic risk factors among birthing mothers, whereas the estimated benefits to black-white disparities in LBW were unexplained and are an important topic for future research.    In sum,  l ocal government   efforts to stimulate employment opportunities and economic growth are likely to have a salubrious impact on birth outcomes and re duce racial health disparities."

"400" "Measures"
"401" "Income inequality .  The county-level Gini coefficient was used to represent income inequality.  The Gini coefficient is a measure of statistical dispersion representing inequality in values, with 0 indicating perfect equality (equal income values across units) and 1 indicating perfect inequality (all income held by single unit).  The Census Bureau has released historical income inequality data based on the 1990 and 2000 decennial Censuses, available at  https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/dec/historical-income-counties.html .  Data for subsequent periods were derived from American Community Survey estimates (2005-2007; 2007-2009; 2012-2014).  To match assessment periods with those of the race-specific income estimates, and to handle inconsistencies in years for which data are available, we  used   weighted averages from  proximate assessment periods  to compute  income inequality for periods corresponding to racial income differences."
"402" "Unemployment .  Annual labor force  participation and unemployment  data by county across the study periods are available through the Bureau of Labor Statistic.  Unemployment rates represent the percent of adults (16 years and over) who are in the labor market yet unemployed.  Three-year pooled averages were computed to correspond to median income estimates.  These data  are available  at https://www.bls.gov/lau/data.htm."
"403" "Employment and median earnings by industry .  The Bureau of Labor Statistics collects employment data for around 97% of civilian jobs as part of the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages.  Data for filled job positions and earnings are reported by employers through the Unemployment Insurance programs and tabulated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.   Annual county data for employment and median earnings by industry were retrieved from  https://www.bls.gov/cew/datatoc.htm .  Two broad domains of industry were selected based on North American Industry Classification codes: the Goods-Producing Industries supersector group (i.e., construction; manufacturing; and natural resources and mining), and the Service-Producing Industries supersector group (e.g.,  education and health services ; information;   financial activities;  professional  and business services;  trade , transportation, and utilities)  (Hiles, 2001) .  Three-year pooled averages were computed."
"404" "Median earnings for full-time employees .  An advantage of median household income is the measurement of all household income sources, providing a more thorough assessment of household resources.  Yet, median household income is also ambiguous, influenced by the number of household income earners, wage levels, and the receipt of government assistance.  Thus,  to consider  income  levels independent of  household size  and government assistance , median  earnings for full-time year- round employ ment  were also examined in select periods when data were available.   These d ata  by race and sex categories  were obtained through Census Bureau programs (namely, from the 2000 Decennial Census and American Community Survey 2005-2007, 2007-2009, and 2011-2013 estimates), with weighted estimates  for each of the four race-sex groupings  being computed.   Due to limited data availability, o nly the final three periods of data were  modeled resulting in a sample of 723 counties with 1628 observations ."
"405" "Results"
"406" "Supplemental m odels were fit wherein black LBW incidence was  examined as  the outcome in place of the absolute black-white LBW difference .  Full model results are depicted in table S3 and show  a similar pattern to  the primary analyses .  Specifically, adjusting for white LBW incidence, increases in  county  median household income were associated with reduced  black LBW incidence .  Conditioning on overall median income, an increase  in  county  black median household income  was  linked with higher black LBW incidence.   That is to say, if black median income grew at a rate faster than the overall county median income, the LBW incidence rate tended to rise among Black infants.     Inclusion of  the county prevalence of  sociodemographic and health  risk  factors  among black mothers  collectively attenuated estimates for median income by 36% and black-white income difference by 18%."
"407" "In post-hoc analyses, we examined three labor market explanations  that could account for  the association between the racial income gap and black-white LBW differences.   First,  rising income inequality, when due to growing income among top earners,  may  increase the availability of financial resources  available within local communities  (for individual earners and as additional tax revenue)  and thus  has  the potential to increase health-promoting resources  (Boustan et al., 2013; Fan et al., 2016; Siddiqi et al., 2016) .  Second,  increasing unemployment, despite financial stress, could benefit pregnancy outcomes by improving eligibility for social services like Medicaid  and the Supplemental Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)  while increasing time for prenatal care and positive health behaviors   (Menclova, 2013) . Third, as a result of racial employment  differenc es by industry type   (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018) , employment shocks within specific industries would be expected to influence racial income differences.  For industries with negative health externalities for the local population (e.g., pollution or toxins due to manufacturing or natural resource extraction), a loss of employment cou ld disproportionately reduce income levels among the black population yet benefit pregnancy outcomes  (e.g., from lower pollution and less physically strenuous work; Galea et al., 2005; Li et al., 2017; Mozurkewich et al., 2000) .    In each of the examples above, such  market changes likely correspond to  larger   black-white income differences yet have the  potential to reduce  adverse birth outcomes  (Hoynes et al., 2011; Joyce, 1990; Li et al., 2017; Mozurkewich et al., 2000; Siddiqi et al., 2016) ."
"408" "Tables S4 and S5 display the results from a series of post-hoc models in which labor market variables  were  tested as predictors of county black LBW incidence rate and the county black-white LBW difference, respectively.  The purpose of these models was to evaluate the change in the estimated associations for black median income and black-white income differences when adjusting for time-varying labor market factors.  Adjustment  for  income inequality (Model 2b); unemployment (2c);  and tota l employment and annual average wages for goods-producing and service-producing industries (2d)  attenuated the association between black median inco me and black LBW incidence by 14, 2, and 24 % , respectively,  and by 31% collectively  ( see Table S4).  When modeling the absolute racial gap in LBW (see Table S5), a  slightly smaller  share of the  black-white  median income  difference  estimate  (~17%)  was explained by total employment and  annual average  wages  for goods-producing and service-producing industries ."
"409" "Examination of partial correlations residualized for county and period effects indicates that black median income was higher and black-white income differences smaller when employment in goods-producing industries was higher ( r =.13 and  r =.07, respectively;  p  values < .001). Black median income was lower and black-white income differences larger when employment in service-producing industries was higher ( r =-.05 and  r =-.06, respectively;  p  values < .05).  Black median income  also  was higher when average wages rose in goods-producing industries ( r =.12,  p  <.001) but not service-producing industries ( r =.03,  p =.17), yet black-white income differences were larger in both of these cases ( r =-.18 and  r =-.04, respectively;  p  values < .05). Thus, findings suggest that rising employment and wages in goods- producing industries benefits black median income levels but that negative externalities may exist in terms of higher LBW incidence.  In contrast, a shift in the labor market toward service-producing industries may increase black-white income differences while reducing racial disparities in LBW rates. These post-hoc results highlight the need for future research to uncover how the health-related effects of racial economic inequities are dependent on characteristics of local labor markets, including racial differences in employment by industry and environmental correlates (e.g., pollution).  To obtain equitable health outcomes, policy and social efforts might be best directed not only at supporting access to higher paying employment but to employment that does not carry disproportionate health burdens."
