ABSTRACT

The rising cost of textbooks for students has been highlighted as a major concern in higher education,
particularly in the USA and Canada. Less has been reported, however, about the costs of textbooks
outside of North America, including in Europe. We address this gap in the knowledge through a case
study of one Irish higher education institution, focussing on the cost, accessibility, and licensing of
textbooks. We report here on an investigation of textbooks prices drawing from an official college
course catalog containing several thousand books. We detail how we sought to determine meta-data
of these books including: the formats they are available in, whether they are in the public domain and
the retail prices. We explain how we used methods to automatically determine textbook costs using
Google Books API and make our code and dataset publicly available.
INTRODUCTION

The cost of textbooks is a hot topic for Higher Education. It has been reported that by 2014 the
average student spent $1,200 annually on textbooks.1 Another study claimed that between 2006
and 2016 the costs of college textbooks increased over four times the cost of inflation.2 Despite
this rise in textbook costs, a survey of more than 3,000 US faculty members (“The Babson Survey”)
found that almost every course (98%) mandated a textbook, or related study resources.3 One
response to the challenge of rising textbook costs is open textbooks. Open textbooks are a type of
Open Educational Resource (OER). OERs have been defined as “teaching, learning, and research
resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property
license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others. Open educational resources include
full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other
tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge.”4 OERs stem from the
principle that access to education is a human right and that, as such, education should be
accessible to all.5 Hence an open textbook is made available under terms which grant legal rights
to the public, not only to use, but also to adapt and redistribute. Creative Commons licensing is the
most prevalent and well-developed intellectual property licensing tool for this purpose.
Open textbook projects aimed at promoting publishing and redistributing open textbooks, both in
digital and print formats, have been growing. For example, the BCampus project in Canada began
in 2012 with the aim of creating a collection of open textbooks aligned with the most popular
subject areas in British Columbia.6 The project has shown strong growth, with over 230 open
digital textbooks now available and more than 40 institutions involved. A significant recent

development in open textbooks occurred in March 2018, when the US Congress announced a $5
million investment in an open textbook initiative.7
In addition to helping change institutional culture, and challenge attitudes to traditional
publishing models, one of the most oft-cited benefits of open textbooks is cost savings. According
to the College Board’s Survey of Colleges the average annual cost to US undergraduate students in
2017 for textbooks and materials was estimated at $1,250.8 This figure is remarkably close to the
aforementioned figure of $ 1,200 a year, reported by Baglione and Sullivan. However, there is little
known about the monetary face value of books that students are expected to buy, beyond studies
based on self-reported data. Students themselves in the USA have attempted to at least open the
debate in this area by highlighting book price disparities.9 Nonetheless, they only report on a very
small number of books, and the College Board representing on-campus US textbook retailers have
disputed their results for this reason, claiming that they have been selective in the book prices
they have chosen.
Hence this study seeks to address the gap that exists in knowledge about the true cost of textbooks
in higher education. This is in the context of a wider research project we are conducting on open
textbooks in Ireland.10 Determining the cost of books is not straightforward as books can be new,
used, rental or digital subscription. However, the cost of new books does set a baseline for other
forms, particularly rental and used books. Our aim here is hence to start with new books, by
analyzing costs of all the required and recommended textbooks of one Higher Education
Institution (HEI) in Ireland.
The overarching research question this study sought to address is: What is known about the
currently assigned textbooks in an Irish university? The sub-questions were:
RQ1: What is the extent of textbooks that are required reading?
RQ2: What are the retail costs of textbooks?
RQ3: Are textbooks available in digital or e-book form?
RQ4: Are textbooks available in the public domain?
The next section outlines our methodology and how we sought to find answers to these questions.
METHODS

In this section we describe our approach, the dataset generated and the methods we used to
analyze the data. We identified a suitable data source comprising the official course catalog of a
HEI in Ireland with more than 10,000 students. In the course catalog faculty give required and
recommended textbook details for all courses. This information is freely accessible on the website
of the HEI; the course catalog is powered by a software system known as Akari
(http://www.akarisoftware.com/). Akari is a proprietary software system used by several higher
educational institutions in Ireland and outside to create and manage academic course catalogs.
The course team gained access to a download of all books recorded in the database of the course
catalog (Figure 1). In this catalog, fields are provided for lecturers to input information for
students about books such as title, International Standard Book Number (ISBN), author and
publisher. Following manual and automated data cleansing, 3,014 unique records of books were

created. Due to the large number of books, at this stage we sought a programmatic solution for
finding out more information about these books.

Figure 1. Course Catalog Screenshot.
We initially thought that ISBNs might prove the best way to accurately reconcile records of books.
However, many ISBNs were incomplete or mistyped. Moreover, many instructors simply did not
enter an ISBN. Given the capacity for errors in the data – for instance, some lectures simply
entered “I will tell you in class” in the book title field – we required a tool that could handle fuzzy
search queries e.g. cases where a book title or author were misspelled. The tool we selected was
the Google Books Application Programming Interface (API).11 This API provides an interface to the
Google Books database of circa 30 million books. The service, like the main Google search engine,
is forgiving of queries that are mistyped or misspelled. Hence, we constructed a query based on a
combination of author name, book title and publisher. Following experimentation, we determined
that these three search terms together allowed us to find books with a high degree of accuracy
whilst also accounting for possible spelling errors.

We then wrote a custom JavaScript middleware program deployed in the Google Cloud Platform.
This program parsed the file of the book search queries, passed them to the Google Books API as
search requests and saved the results. The API returned results in JavaScript Object Notation
(JSON) format. JSON is a modern web language for describing data. It is related to JavaScript and
can be used to translate objects in the JavaScript programming language into textual strings. It is
used as a replacement for XML as it is arguably more human readable and is considerably less
verbose. We then imported this JSON into a MongoDB database to filter and clean the data, before
finally exporting them to Excel for statistical analysis. MongoDB is a document store database that
natively stores objects in the JSON format and allows for efficient querying of the data.
The Google Books API provides some key metadata on books aside from the usual author,
publisher, ISBN, edition, pages etc. as it gives prices for selected books. Google draws this
information from its own e-book store which contains over 3 million books and a network of
resellers who sell print and digital versions of the books. In addition to price, Google Books also
contains information on accessible versions of books, digital/e-pub versions, PDF versions and
whether the book is in the public domain. We have published a release of this dataset and all of
our code to the software repository GitHub. We then used the Zenodo platform to generate a
Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for the code.12 One of the functions of the Zenodo platform is to
allow for code to be properly cited and referenced. We published our code in this way for others
interested in replicating this work in other contexts. In the next section we will provide an
analysis of the results of our queries.
RESULTS

After extracting and processing the data from the course catalog and Google platforms, we
obtained 3,030 unique course names and in these courses we found over 15,414 books listed.
Required versus Recommended Reading

From the course catalog data, we found that 11,022 (71.5%) books were required readings and
the remaining 4,392 (28.5%) were recommended.

Upon cleaning and removing duplicates and missing data, we identified 3,014 books that could be
queried using the Google Books API. Querying the API returned results for 2,940 books i.e. it found
97% of the books and only 74 books could not be found. The Google Books API returns
information in JSON format. Figure 3 below shows an example of the JSON information returned
for one book.

Cost Results

The Google Books API only returned prices for 596 (20%) of the books that we searched for.
Within that sample, the cost ranged from $0.99 to over $452, as illustrated in Figure 5 below. The
median price of a book was $40, and the mean price was $56.67.

Figure 5. Summary of Book Prices (n = 596).
As there are on average 3.96 books per course, this implies an average cost to students of $224.41
per course taken. As students take an average of 8.05 courses per year, this further implies a cost
per year of $1,806.50 per student if they were to buy new versions of all the books.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We have demonstrated that it is possible to programmatically search and determine the prices of
large numbers of books. We used this information to attempt to estimate the full economic cost of
books to students on average in an Irish HEI. We are still actively developing this tool and
encourage others to use and even contribute to the code which we have published with the
dataset. This proof of concept tool may allow stakeholders with an interest in book costs for
students to quickly get real data on large numbers of books. Ultimately, we hope that this will help
highlight the costs of many textbooks. Our findings also highlight relatively low levels of digital
book availability.
Very few books were found to be in the public domain. A limitation of this research is that there
are issues around the coverage of Google Books and its index policies or algorithms. In a literature
review of research articles about Google Books in 2017, Fagan pointed out that the coverage of
Google Books is “hit and miss.”13 In 2017, Google Books included about 30 million books, though
Google did not release specific details on its database, as emphasized by Fagan. It is known that
content includes digitized collections from over 40 libraries, and that US and English-language
books are overrepresented.14 Furthermore, Google Books is only returning results for books that
are in the public domain and cannot tell us if books are made available through open licenses such
as Creative Commons. Accepting such caveats, however, we have found the Google Books API to be
a very useful tool for answering questions about large numbers of books in a systematic way and
hope that our findings can help others.

The prices that we derived in this study were for new books only. However, the new book prices
provide a baseline for all other prices e.g. a used book or a loan book price will be relative to a new
book price and library budgets will need to take account of new book prices.15 Further study is
required to determine a more realistic figure for the cost of textbooks and the next phase of our
wider open textbook research projects involves interviews and focus groups with students to
better understand the lived reality of their relationship with textbooks.16
