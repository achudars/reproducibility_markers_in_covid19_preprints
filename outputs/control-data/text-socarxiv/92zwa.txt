"11" "IMMIGRATION AND PREFERENCES FOR  GREATER  LAW ENFORCEMENT  SPENDING  IN RICH DEMOCRACIES"
"12" "Abstract:"
"13" "I mmigration  to  rich democracies  gr e w substantially  in the 1990s and 2000s .   We  investigate  whether   the rise of  immigration influenced the  novel   and  salient outco me of  preferences for greater  law enforcement  spending .   We propose that these preferences are consequential for policymaking, reflect  popular demand fo r punitive social control, and represent   micro-level preferences underlying the politics of criminal justice.  Motivated by literatures on  criminal justice politics,  minority thr eat, and the fear of crime ,  w e  examine  whether  sto cks and flows of immigration influence  individual-level preferences  for greater  law enforcement  spending.   Using International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data , w e analyze between-country variation with multi-level models  of 25 countries  in 2006 ,  and within-country variation with  differences-in-differences   ( DD )  models  of  16 countries  with available data  in  both 1996 and  2006.  Both  multilevel and  DD   models  show that flows of   immigration increase  preferences for greater law enforcement spending .  Indeed, t he  coefficients for  immigration flow s are  larger than or  comparable in magnitude to   the  coefficients for   any  other   variable , and are  robust  net of homicide rates and police officers  per  100,000 .  By contrast , t he stock of immigrants  is not  robustly  associated with preferences .  The results demonstrate that  rising  immigration  contributed to increasing public support for  greater law enforcement spending."
"14" "Immigration to rich democracies increased substantially  in  the 1990s and 2000s .  In deed ,  f or many rich democracies, this   period featured  the largest annual increase s  in immigration since the availability of cross-nationally reliable immigration data  (WDI 2016 ) .   Yet, w hile immigration  grew  in most rich democracies ,  including both the U.S. and Western Europe,  a few  (e.g. Japan and Poland)  continued to have small immigrant populations.   As a result,  rich democracies exhibit tremendous variation in immigration across countries and over  recent decades ."
"15" "In response to rising  immigration  to  Western Europe, animosity toward foreign born residents rose to  historically  high level s   (McLaren 2012; Semyonov  et al.  2006) , which   contributed to  the  rise  of extreme Right parties   ( Arzheimer 2009 ;  Kitschelt 1997 ; Rydgren 2005 ) .   Lively  debate has occurred over whether  immigration  and ethnic heterogeneity  erode trust and solidarity  ( Abascal and Baldassarri 2015;  McLaren 2012 ) ,  and   undermine  public support for  social policy   ( Brady and Finnigan 2014;   Catran-Schmidt and Spies 2016 ; Steele 2016 ) .  M any  studies  focus  on the  consequences  of immigration stocks, or pe rcent of the population  foreign born. However, there is  also  growing interest in immigration flows, or changes and  surges  in immigration  ( Ceobanu and Escandell 2010;  Hopkins 2010 ; Newman and Velez 2014 ) . Some propose  that immigration flows may have even larger effects  than  stocks  (Meuleman  et al .  2009 ; Newman and Velez 2014 ) .  The refore, the  recent increase in immigration, combined   with  cross-national survey data,  provides  a  unique opportunit y  to  study the  political and social consequences of   immigration."
"16" "Despite  growing interest in the  consequences  of immigration,  the politics of law enforcement has been   neglected as a potential outcome .  This is unfortunate as a relationship  between rising immigration and  the politics of  law enforcement  i s  plausible.  Past research suggests r ising immigration  could  trigger  minority threat and increase the  fear of crime, both of  which  could  influence the politics of law enforcement.  Indeed, c ross-national research shows e thnic  heterogeneity is associated with higher imprisonment and harsher punishments   (Jacobs and Kleban 2003 ; Ruddell and Urbina 2004 ) .   A cross French communities  for example ,  Pager (2008) finds a greater pe rcent of North Africans increases  the use of pretrial detentions and judicial control , and  rates of criminal convictions .  There is  even  evidence that countries with open and multicultural policies to immigrants have higher incarceration rates   (Koopmans 2010) ."
"17" "Building on these insights,  we examine   the relationship between  immigration  and  preferences for greater government spending on police and law enforcement.  Using International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data, we analyze between-country variation with multi-level models  of 25 countries  in 2006 . We also analyze  within-country variation with  differences-in-differences  models  of 16 countries with available data in both 1996 and 2006 .  By  studying individual preferences for law enforcement spending , we explore a n ovel   social  consequence of immigration and a n understudied   element i n   the politics of  criminal justice .  In the  next secti on, we justify this focus  on preferences for greater  law enforcement  spending. Then, draw ing  on literatures on  the politics of  criminal justice ,  minority threat, and the fear of crime,  we  develop  expectations for the relationship between immigration and  these preferences ."
"18" "THE  SALIENCE OF  PREFERNCES FOR  LAW ENFORCEMENT"
"19" "Like   other aspects of public policy  (Manza and Brooks 2012) , p ublic opinion is  consequential to the politi cs of law enforcement (Enns 2016 ; Garland 2002 ; Jennings et al. 2016 ) (Garland 2002, 37–38, 96–102, 167–192) . Criminal justice depends on public resources,  and politicians making decisions on law enforcement sp ending are highly responsive  to public opinion  (Barker 2009; Garland 1990; Jacobs and Helms 1999) .  In his classic account,  Garland (2002) contends that the recent  expansion of punitive systems of control was partly driven by popular demand for policing and proactive crime prevention. Even though there is likely a reciprocal relationship between politicians/policy and public opinion, the dramatic increase in incarceration  in the  U.S.A.  was at least partly driven  by public opinion and the  growing  popularity of punitiveness  (Beckett and Sasson 2003;  Enns 2016;  Campbell and Schoenfeld 2013) .  For i nstance, Enns (2014)  estimates  that had the popularity of punishment stopped rising in the 1970s, there would be  a  20   percentage   lower  incarcera tion   rate  in the  U.S.A.   Others show that  public opi nion on the death penalty  influence s  the election of judges and how judges vote  (Brace and  Boyea, 2008) .  Scholars have noted that historically public opinion was less influential on criminal justice outside the  U.S.A.  ( Savelsberg 1994). However, recent studies show incarceration rates responded to public support throughout Western Europe and North America ( Jennings et al. 2016 ; Mayhew and Kestern 2013 ), and punishment practices were at least partly shaped by public opinion across rich democracies (Kury et al. 2013)."
"20" "Therefore, p references for greater s pending on law enforcement   plausibly  serve as a  micro-level  mechan ism  in  the politics of  criminal justice  (Enns 2016) .  In addition to being consequential  for policy ,  public opinion concerning law enforcement is   interesting  as a manifestation of public  and cultural  sentiment  (Manza and Brooks 2012) .  Several  scholars have shown that public opinion regarding law enforcement  is  driven more by social anxiety, fear and perceptions of insecurity and malice toward a perceived threat  rather  than actual crime  ( Beckett 1997;  Elchardus  et al.  2008;  Savelsberg 1994 ) .   As Garland (2002 : 194, 199 ) observes,  “ the  d esire for security , orderliness and control” has “ social roots , ”  including  especially   social and ethnic divisions .  Hence, preferences for greater government spending on law enforcement speak to popular demand  for policing, punishment and social control."
"21" "Despite our claim that public opinion on law enforcement is salient, there is relatively little research on individual preferences for government spending on law enforcement (Barkan and Cohn  2005;  Soroka and Wlezien 2010 ) . Although there is research on attitudes toward criminal punishment  (Baumer et al. 2003; Bobo and Johnson 2004; Enns 2014; King and Wheeolock 2007) , there has been a lack of research on the specific ISSP/GSS question on preferences for greater spending on police and law enforcement."
"22" "CRIMINAL JUSTICE POLITICS, MINORITY THREAT, AND FEAR OF CRIME"
"23" "The literature on the politics of criminal justice demonstrates how political actors mobilize the fear of crime, racial and ethnic divisions, and insecurity with social change to expand law enforcement and punishment (Barkan and Cohn  2005;  Barker 2009; Beckett 1997; Garland 2002; Jacobs and Carmichael 2001; Jacobs and Helms 1999). This literature often concentrates on the  American case, chronicling  the politics behind  America’s swift and dramatic rise to becoming the  world’s most punitive country   (Beckett 1997; Beckett and Sasson 2003; Campbell and Schoenfeld 2013) . However,  while the  U.S.A.  may be the cardinal case of a heavily politicized punitive system, poli tics and public opinion  influence law enforcement  and punishment in other settings  as well  (Garland 2002; Ruddell and Urbina 2004) .  Indeed, Jacobs and Kleban (2003) claim that politics better explain  variation  between affluent democracies  in punishment and law  enforcement pr actices  than other potential explanations."
"24" "Underlying much of the literature on the politics of criminal justice is minority threat theory. Following Blumer’s (1958) account, the dominant group feels a sense of superiority and an entitlement to privilege and advantage over an alien subordinate group. Minority threat is triggered by the fear and suspicion that the subordinate group intends to undermine the dominant  group’s privilege and advantage. Thus, minority threat theory emphasizes the subjective perception of a dominant group identity, their difference from and superiority over an alien minority, and their “felt challenge” to protect against a perceived threat (Blumer 1958: 5). In minority threat theory, politicians, entrepreneurs and the media play a key role in constructing the dominant group’s identity and the perception of minority threat. These subjective perceptions are then often linked to  behavior and politics that reflect the majority group’s desire to maintain and protect their dominance over the subordinate minority  (Blalock 1973) ."
"25" "Minority threat theory is particularly relevant to our study for at least two reasons. First, minority threat has been utilized to explain  responses to immigration  (Crowder et al .  2011; Quillian 1995; Wang 2012). For instance,  scholars have used immigrant threa t to explain how increasing  foreign born populations  in the 1990s and 2000s triggered o pposition to immigration  and anti-foreigner sentiment  (Kaya and Karakoç 2012;  Meuleman  et al 2009;  Semyonov et al. 2006 ) .  Indeed, scholars have shown that  Mexican immigrants are perceived as equally or even more threatening as African-Americans to native-born Whites  (Eitle and Taylor 2008) . Second, minority threat should encourage preferences for greater law enforcement spending. Many  show that racial/ethnic heterogeneity is associated with greater punitiveness, harsher sentences, more aggressive law enforcement, and increased resources for criminal justice  ( e.g.  Beckett 1997;  Light 2015; Muller 2012; Pager 2008; Ruddell and Urbina 2004). Indeed , areas in the  U.S.A.  with  a greater share  of African Americans have more police officers per capita  (Jacobs and Carmichael 2001; Kent and Jacobs 2005; Stults and Baumer 2007) ."
"26" "Much research on minority threat concentrates on competitive threats  from out-groups to  the majority group’s power ,  interests,  and especially  economic or political resources  ( C eobanu and Escandell  2010) . This  implies that the maj ority group is  aware of an economic and political  threat, and  alters its behavior and beliefs  to protect its dominance   (Blalock 1973; Blumer 1958; Muller 2012) . F or instance,  competitive threat  has been used  to explain why the economically marginalized  (e.g. less educated)  are more prone to anti-immigrant sentiments, particularly in a context of high unemployment  (Kaya and  Karakoç  2012; McLaren 2003; Semyonov et al. 2006) . Nevertheless, com petitive  threats  over resources  are un likely to be the sole so urce of preferences for greater law enforceme nt spending ( Stults  and Baumer  2007 ). Rather, immigration must influence  a broader set of social-psychological processes beyond solely economic or political interests. For example, even though King and Wheelock (2007) find that the perception that African Americans are economic threats matters to pun itive attitudes,  the perception that African A mericans are a threat to safety also matters."
"27" "Beyond competitive threat, one plausible reason that minority threat should increase preferences for greater law enforcement spending  is the  fear of crime. When individuals are surrounded by  culturally different  out-groups, anxiety  about  and fear of crime are higher  (Elchardus et al. 2008; Liska et al. 1982).  Socially marginalized out- groups are more likely to be  constructed and labeled as delinquent and deviant  (Calavita 2003; Hagan and Palloni 1999; Wacquant 1999) .   Indeed,  immigrants are  an out-group   often socially constructed as criminal (Calavita 2003; Wacquant 1999) ,  seen as problem population s even in the absence of deviance (Spitzer 1975 ) , and  perceived as a criminal threat (Wang 2012) ."
"28" "Several studies demonstrate that the  presence of racial/et hnic minorities increases the perception of crime in a neighborhood , regardless of actual levels of  crime  (Quillian and Pager 2001 ; Wang 2012 ) .  For example,  the  size of the  Latino population   predicts Whites’ fear of crime  (Eitle and Taylor 2008), and  the perceived proximity of Hispanics increases the perceived risk of  being a victim of  crim e  (Chiri cos et al. 2001). Also , the changin g racial/ ethnic composition  resulting from immigration provokes a perception of unstable social change and insecurity ( Hopkins 2010) . Therefore, even if ris ing immigration does not provide a competitive threat to  the dominant majority ’s resources , the fear of crime is likely to  manifest from  a  subjectively perceived threat  to security and stability (King and Wheelock 2007)."
"29" "To the extent that immigration increases the fear of crime, the fear of crime should then increase  preferences for  greater  law enforcement spending.  There is evidence that the fear of crime influences law  enforcement strategies  (Terrill and Reisig 2003) .  There is also evidence of a connection between immigration, the fear of crime, and incarceration rates  (Crutchfield and Pettinicchio 2009) . However, there is a paucity of scholarship linking the fear of crime specifically to preferences regarding law enforcement.  In  a  rare exception, King and Wheelock (2007) show that the perception that African Americans are a threat to public safet y predicts punitive attitudes. However, t hey  stress that there is need for further research connecting changing racial/ethnic composition, perceptions of crime, and punitiveness.  Therefore, while  the fear of crime is one plausible mechanism between immigration, minority threat, and preferences for law enforcement spending, research showing immigration influences such preferences could enhance understanding of these processes."
"30" "EMPIRICAL IMPLICATIONS"
"31" "We expect a positive association between immigration and preferences for greater law enforcement spending. However, it is important to distinguish between stocks and flows of immigration. First, many studies built on minority threat theory focus on  immigration  stock , or  percent foreign born ( Eitle and Taylor 2008;  Kaya and Karakoç 2012;  Quillian 1995; Semyonov et al. 2006). Following this literature’s use of objective measures of immigration stock, we  expect that percent foreign born will be positively related to preferences for greater  law enforcement spending."
"32" "Beyond objective levels of immigrant stock, it is important to recall that minority threat was originally focused on subjective perceptions, felt challenge, fear, and the threat constructed through the media, by politicians, and through collective identity formation (Blumer 1958). These perceptions might not be driven as much by actual experiences interacting with a larger immigrant population, but by constructed subjective feelings, fears, and images.  Therefore,  political reactions  and changes in public opinion   may be even  more  pronounced  with sudden influxes  of immigrants   (Ceobanu and Escandell 2010; Hopkins 2010; Meuleman et al. 2009). Indeed, citizens’ perception of immigration into their community is more responsive to the rapid growth of immigration than the size of the immigrant population (Newman and Velez 2014). Indeed, that perceptions are driven more by such seemingly unstable, rapid increases in immigration rather than stable high levels is consistent with Blumer’s (1958: 7) argument that prejudice and threat “usually become pronounced only as a consequence of grave disorganizing events that allow for the formation of a scapegoat.”  As a result, we expect  immigration  flows  will be positively related to  preferences for greater  law enforcement spending."
"33" "Third, we expect that the relationship between immigration and preferences for greater law enforcement spending will exist independently of crime rates.  Although there is often a perception of an immigrant-crime link, the idea of the criminal migrant is formed more by prejudice and stigma than by actual crime  ( Hagan and Palloni 1999 ; Kubrin 2013) . Many studies demonstrate that immigration does not cause crime and that immigrants are less likely to engage in criminal and delinquent behavior than natives  (e.g. Ousey and Kubrin 2009) .  Therefore, rising immigration should influence preferences regardless of actual crime."
"34" "Before proceeding, it is important to acknowledge plausible counterarguments to our expectations that immigration directly affects preferences. Several studies suggest immigration might only affect beliefs when interacted with measures of economic development (e.g. GDP per capita) or performance (e.g. unemployment rates) (e.g. Quillian 1995). As noted above, immigration might only have effects in a context of media and politicians’ mobilization and social construction of immigrants as criminals and subordinate others. This might mean that any direct effect of immigration on preferences is small, especially after controlling for the mediating role of affiliation with extreme right political parties. While studies show respondents can generally perceive the immigrant share in their local communities (Newman et al. 2013), perceptions of nationwide immigration levels tend to be biased upwards (Gallagher 2014; Sides and Citrin 2007). Because these biases are more pronounced among certain groups, it is possible that immigration will only be associated with preferences among, for example, the less educated. All these factors make it less likely we will find a positive direct association between immigration and preferences for greater law enforcement spending. If we find a significant positive association, it is despite these factors."
"35" "DATA AND METHODS"
"36" "The analyses are based on data from the  1996 and 2006 International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) . The ISSP is an annual, internationally-standardized set of nationally representative surveys. We use the 1996 and 2006 role of government modules, which contain the question on preferences for greater government spending on the police and law enforcement. The  World Bank World Development Indicators Database (WDI)  provides the data on  immigration . P olice and crime data  are  from the United Nations Survey on Crime Trends (CTS) ."
"37" "The analyses include all 25 rich democracies with ISSP data: Australia, Canada, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Latvia, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Spain, Slovenia, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom and the United States. In the 2006 cross-section, data are available for all 25 countries.  In the pooled 1996-2006 sample, data are available in both waves for 16 countries (omitting Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Latvia, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, and South Korea)."
"38" "Dependent Variable"
"39" "Our dependent variable is based on the ISSP question: “Please show whether you would like to see more or less government spending in :  the police and law enforcement.” Each respondent was given a scale of five response options: “Spend much more,” “Spend more,” “Spend the same as now,” “Spend less,” and “Spend much less.”  In our variable,  preference for greater law enforcement spending,  “Spend much more” and “Spend more” are coded as a 1 and all other responses are coded as a 0."
"40" "In addition to following research  on welfare attitudes   ( Brady and Finnigan 2014; Svallfors 2006 ) , we  dichotomized the dependent variable  for  four  reasons.  First, because the study spans 25 countries,  the difference s  between  precise categories such as “Spend less” and “S pend much less”  likely vary due to cultural, historical and linguistic differences. Second, relatively few respondents selected “Spend much less.” Third, respondents were also informed: “ Reme mber that if you say ‘much more’ , it might require   a tax increase to pay for it.”  The meaning of this also likely varies due to cultural, historical and linguistic differences, which makes the measurement of preferring “much more” spending less cross-nationally reliable.  Fourth ,  we  also estimated  the models  with the underlying ordinal values and using   linear,  ordinal  logi stic, and ordinal generalized linear regression .  The se alternatives are presented in Appendix III and are consistent with the presented results ."
"41" "Key  Independent Variables   The immigration data are available for all countries in 1985, 1995 and 2005, meaning the immigration variables are lagged one year (WDI 2016).  We examine both the stock and flow of immigration. For stock, we use the  percent foreign born.  For flows, we analyze  net migration  and the rate of  change in percent foreign born . Net migration measures the number of immigrants minus the number of emigrants as a percentage of the population. The rate of change is calculated by subtracting the 2006 value minus the 1996 value, dividing by the 1996 value and multiplying times 100."
"42" "Though the three measures are related, each is distinct. At the macro-level in 2006 (N=25), percent foreign born correlates .30 with net migration, and -.38 with the change in percent foreign born. Net migration correlates .39 with the change. Unfortunately, it is not possible to examine immigration by country of origin. Still, we discuss sensitivity analyses with one measure below."
"43" "Control  Variables At the country level, we include the  homicide  rate   per 100,000 and the  number of  police officers  per 100,000. Homicide rates are the most conventional and reliable cross-national crime indicator available  (Fajnzylber et al. 2002) . The nearly universal use of death certificates across these countries reduces the problem of under-reporting. Other types of crime, including theft and assault, are less reliable cross-nationally because they rely on the willingness of the residents to report the crime. This willingness systematically varies across countries  (Soares 2004) . Also, the definition of homicide does not vary across countries nearly as much as other crimes such as  assault and theft  (Bennett and Lynch 1990) . Still,  a s a robustness check, we  estimated all models with other  measures of crime.  Using any combination of theft, assault, homicide and overall crime rates , the results were consistent. We control for police officers to adjust for baseline shortages or surpluses of police and law enforcement spending in a country."
"44" "Following prior research on law enforcement spending in the U.S.A.  (e.g. Jacobs and Helms 1999) , we also analyzed  other country-level indicators including the Gini coefficient,  economic growth, the employment rate, and GDP per capita .  Appendices IV-V show the main results while controlling for GDP per capita.  However, we ultimately omit these variables  in order to keep the models parsimonious at level-2, and   because their inclusion does not alter our conclusions."
"45" "We also include a set of individual-level variables from the ISSP. We include two dummy variables for how the respondent voted in the last election:  extreme right  party  and  left party   (using  ISSP coding of parties) .  The analyses incorporate four measures of religion. Binary measures for each of  P rotestant ,  C atholic , and  other r eligion  are in reference to no religion .  R eligious attendance  is an  ordinal  measure  such that 0= never, 1=less frequently, 2=once a year, 3=several times a year, 4=once a month, 5=2 or 3 times a month, 6=once a week, and 7= several times a week .   W e include  age  and  age-squared  (both converted to z-scores within individual-level samples), and an indicator variable for  female . For marital status, we include binary measures for each of  divorced ,  widowed , and  never married , with married as the reference.  Binary  variables for each of  suburb/town  and  rural  measure geographic context with urban as the reference. For education, binary variables   for  each of  less than secondary  and  university  or above  are used with secondary degree as the reference. To measure employment, we include dummies for each of  not in the labor force ,  part-time employment ,  self-employment ,  public employment  and  unemployed   with   private, full-time employment as the reference. Finally, we  include  relative income , which we obtain by calculating country-year-specific z-scores."
"46" "For the 1996-2006 models ,  data availability prevents us from including some individual-level variables present in 2006 but not all 1996 surveys: party vote, religion,  mari tal status, rural/suburb/urban, part-time employment, and public employment. The 2006 models  were  estimated without these variable s and the results  were consistent .  Descriptive statistics for all variables are included in  Appendix  I."
"47" "Analytical Strategy Two sets of analyses are used. The first are multi-level models with 30,096 respondents from the 2006 ISSP in 25 countries. These models analyze between-country differences to assess the cross-sectional relationship between immigration and preferences. The second set pools the 1996 and 2006 ISSP surveys including 45,122 respondents from the 16 countries participating in both waves. These models analyze within-country over time variation. Within both sets, we first include one immigration variable at a time. We then include each immigration variable while adjusting for the homicide rate and police officers. Finally, we include both percent foreign born and each measure of immigration flows. In Appendices VI-VII, we display the results while omitting the individual-level variables as a robustness check."
"48" "The dependent variable is binary. For the 2006 cross-sectional models, we use multi-level logistic regression  with random intercepts for countries  (Raudenbush and Bryk 2001) . These models can be expressed as two equations. The first equation estimates the log odds of preferring greater law enforcement spending for the  i th individual in the  j th country. This is a function of a random intercept for each country ,  and a set of fixed individual-level coefficients ."
"49" "The second equation predicts the intercept for each country  as a function of a set of country-level variables , an intercept , and an error term ."
"50" "Some suggest that multilevel models can be fragile when too many level-2 variables are included or cross-level interactions are estimated without a large number of level-2 units.  (Bryan and Jenkins 2016; Maas and Hox 2005; Stegmueller 2013) . Therefore, because we only have 25 countries, it is essential to keep the models parsimonious at level-2. As a result, we concentrate on random intercepts in the multi-level models."
"51" "For the pooled 1996-2006 sample of 16 countries, we employ differences-in-differences (DD) logistic regression models. With continuous treatments, no clear “pre/post” periods, and no control group receiving zero treatment, a DD model includes fixed-effects for the 16 countries and a fixed effect for year (Angrist and Pischke 2009). The log odds of  preferring greater law  enforcement spending ( ) is a function of an intercept ( ), individual-level variables ( ), country-level variables ( ), fixed-effects for the 16 countries ( ), and a fixed-effect for 2006 ( )."
"52" "The country and year dummies correct for the non-independence of observations within-country and year.  Country dummies adjust for any stable unobserved characteristics of countries with stable effects. There are likely to be stable unobserved characteristics of countries—for example, criminal justice institutions—that are correlated with immigration and preferences for greater law enforcement spending (Savelsberg 1994). Such unobserved characteristics could introduce omitted variable bias, and may influence any effect of immigration we observe in the multi-level  logit models. The country dummies difference out any such stable characteristics, and estimate the effect of  changes in immigration on within-country temporal variation in preferences for greater spending. The fixed-effect for 2006  adjusts  for any generic time trend across countries.  We also robust  cluster the errors by country (Angrist and Pischke 2009)."
"53" "RESULTS"
"54" "Multi-Level Models 2006"
"55" "We begin with the bivariate correlations between the country-level aggregate of preferences for greater law enforcement spending and the immigration measures in 2006. Figure 1 plots the correlation for each immigration measure with 95 percent confidence intervals. The percent foreign born is positively correlated with the proportion with a preference for greater law enforcement spending (r=.10). But, this correlation is relatively trivial. Japan, France, and Switzerland all exhibit lower support for greater spending, but have low, medium and high percent foreign born. Indeed, both the lowest (South Korea) and the highest percent foreign born country (Israel) have similar preferences."
"56" "Despite the weak association with percent foreign born, the proportion supporting greater law enforcement spending is more strongly, positively correlated with the two measures of immigration flows: net migration (r=.47) and the change in percent foreign born (r=.39). Countries that experienced high or increasing migrant flows (e.g. Ireland, Spain) tend to have high support for greater spending. Countries with stagnant migration flows (e.g. Croatia, Japan, and Latvia), had relatively low support for greater spending. Of course, these associations are partly driven by the high migrant flows in Spain and Ireland. However, if we omit Spain and  Ireland, the correlations between preferences for greater spending and all three measures of immigration flows remain positive."

"497" "Several individual-level variables are robustly significant. Preferences for greater spending are positively associated with extreme right party vote, being a Protestant or Catholic, being female or a public employee, and relative income. Preferences are negatively associated with left party vote, religious attendance, living in a rural setting, having a university education, and being part-time employed, unemployed, or self-employed. There is also an inverse u-shaped relationship between preferences and age. The largest odds ratios or inverse odds are for extreme right party vote, Protestant, and university education."
"498" "The first three models include one immigration variable at a time. The measure of stock, percent foreign born, is insignificant in model 1. In models 2-3, the two measures of immigration flows are each significantly positive. Holding all other variables constant at their means, a standard deviation increase in immigration flows is expected to increase preferences by a factor of 1.33-1.39. Compared to the individual-level variables, these standardized odds ratios are substantively large. The standardized odds are comparable to the odds for extreme right party vote and university education. Also, the two measures of flows have larger standardized odds than being Protestant or any other variable."
"499" "Models 4-6 include one immigration variable at a time, while adjusting for the homicide rate and the number of police officers per 100,000 people. The homicide rate and police officers are insignificant in all three models. By contrast, the results for the immigration variables are consistent with models 1-3. In model 4, percent foreign born is insignificant. In model 5-6, the two measures of immigration flows are significantly positively associated with preferences (standardized odds=1.30-1.45). For net migration, the standardized odds are even larger than before controlling for the homicide rate and police officers."
"500" "Models 7-8 include the measure of immigration stock (percent foreign born) along with each measure of flows.  The percent foreign born is not significant in model 7, but is positive and significant in model 8 (p<.10). Despite model 8, we conclude that immigration stock is not robustly associated with preferences for greater law enforcement spending. Like models 1-6, both measures of flows are significantly positive.  Holding other variables constant at their means, a standard deviation increase in immigration flows is associated with increases in preferences for greater law enforcement spending by a factor of 1.41-1.45. In models 7-8, the standardized odds for immigration flows are larger than the odds or standardized odds for any other independent variable."
"501" "To substantively illustrate the effects of the three immigration measures, Figure 2 displays the marginal predicted probabilities of preferences for greater spending on police and law enforcement from models 1-3. As the upper left panel shows, preferences increase modestly from roughly .53 at the lowest percent foreign born country (South Korea) to about .59 at the highest percent foreign born country (Israel). However, the confidence intervals are quite wide and the differences in preferences are not significant. The upper right panel, featuring net migration, exhibits more substantial variation. Preferences increase from about .45 at the minimum net migration country (Latvia) to about .68 at the maximum country (Spain)."
"502" "Figure 2.   Marginal Predicted Probabilities of Preferences for Greater Law Enforcement Spending  (y-axis) from  Multi-Level Logit"
"503" "Models  1-3 in Table 1 ."
"504" "The bottom panel displays similarly pronounced variation in preferences across changes in percent foreign born. At the minimum in the change in percent foreign born (Poland), preferences are expected to be .44, while at the maximum (South Korea), preferences are expected to be .81. Thus, preferences for greater law enforcement spending significantly increase across the range of both measures of immigration flows."
"505" "DD Models 1996-2006"
"506" "We begin with the correlations in the macro-level 1996-2006 changes in the sample of 16 countries with ISSP data in both waves. Figure 3 shows the 1996-2006 changes in the proportion preferring greater law enforcement spending on the y-axis. The x-axis displays the 1996-2006 changes in the immigration stock and flows measures. Like the DD models, this plots within-country over-time change in aggregate preferences and the country-level immigration variables."
"507" "Figure 3 shows changes in preferences correlate positively but weakly with changes in percent foreign born (r=.07). By contrast, changes in preferences correlate more strongly with changes in the two measures of immigration flows (r=.42 with net migration, and .31 with relative change in percent foreign born). Net migration has the strongest association. Countries with declining net migration (e.g. Germany and New Zealand) had declining preferences for greater law enforcement spending. By contrast, countries like Canada, Spain and Ireland had increasing net migration and increasing preferences. That said, the correlations are weaker and have larger confidence intervals in Figure 3 compared to Figure 1."

"728" "Table 2 presents the results for the DD models. Age, secondary education, and relative income are significantly positively associated with preferences. University education and self-employment are significantly negatively associated with preferences. Having a university education has the largest odds ratio. Holding other variables constant at their means, a university education reduces preferences by a factor of 1.38. Like Table 1, the homicide rate is not significant in models 4-6. However, police officers per 100,000 is significantly negatively associated with preferences in models 4-6. For a standard deviation increase in police officers, preferences are expected to decline by a factor of 1.12-1.19."
"729" "The conclusions from Table 1 are confirmed by Table 2. Immigration stock (i.e. percent foreign born) is insignificant in all models. Both measures of immigration flows are robustly significant and positive.  Holding other variables constant at their means, a standard deviation increase in net migration or the change in percent foreign born should increase preferences by a factor of 1.26-1.37 or 1.17-1.23. These effects are substantively large. Net migration has a standardized odds ratio that is nearly as large as university education, and larger than the effect of police officers or other independent variables. The change in percent foreign born has a slightly smaller standard odds ratio, but this effect is still larger than any variable except university education or net migration."

"731" "Figure 4 illustrates the effects of immigration with marginal predicted probabilities of preferences for greater spending on police and law enforcement (based on models 1-3). The differences in predicted probabilities are not significant for percent foreign born in the upper left panel. In the upper right panel, across the range of net migration, preferences increase from .49 to .66. In the bottom right panel, across the range of the change in percent foreign born, preferences increase from .52 to .75. Both of these effects are substantively large."
"732" "Figure 5 counterfactually simulates what would have happened to preferences in 2006 if net migration had remained at 1996 levels. Using the predicted probabilities from model 7, preferences for greater law enforcement spending were .56 in 1996 (blue hollow circles) and .59 in 2006 (black hollow triangles). However, if net migration had remained at 1996 levels, preferences would have been .55 in 2006 (grey filled diamonds). Thus, if net migration had not increased 1996-2006, preferences would have declined. This pattern of lower simulated preferences in 2006 than preferences in 2006 or even 1996 occurs in several countries (e.g. Australia, Canada, Norway, Sweden, and the U.K.). In Spain, preferences would have been .59 in 2006, below predicted preferences of .66 in 1996, and far below predicted preferences of .78 in 2006. Had net migration not increased in Ireland, preferences would have been .65 in 2006 instead of the predicted .84 in 2006 and the predicted .74 in 1996. In the few countries that had declining net migration, preferences would have remained stable. If net migration remained at 1996 levels, 2006 preferences would have been .57 in Germany (vs. predicted .47 in 2006 and actual .61 in 1996) and .75 in New Zealand (vs. predicted .70 in 2006 and actual .79 in 1996). In sum, net migration substantially altered preferences in many rich democracies relative to what those preferences would have been in the absence of increasing immigration."

"734" "DISCUSSION"
"735" "Scholars have examined a variety of consequences for rich democracies of the recent dramatic increase in immigration and the ensuing increased ethnic heterogeneity.  Building on literatures on the politics of criminal justice, minority threat, and the fear of crime, we propose that preferences for greater law enforcement spending are influenced by rising immigration. In turn, these preferences warrant attention alongside well-studied outcomes of immigration like trust, solidarity, social policy attitudes, and anti-immigrant sentiments.  In addition, we propose that preferences for greater law enforcement spending are consequential for policymaking, reflect  popular demand for punitive social control, and represent micro-level preferences in the politics of criminal justice.  Using International Social Survey Programme (ISSP) data on 25 rich democracies in 1996-2006, we examine both immigration stocks and flows. We use multi-level models of 25 countries in 2006 to analyze between-country variation, and DD models of 16 countries in 1996-2006 to analyze within-country variation. We also consider the potentially conflating country-level variables of crime rates and police force size."
"736" "In both analyses, we find  immigration  is positively associated with preferences for greater police and  law enforcement spending.  Across both multilevel and DD models, the two measures of immigration flows are robustly significant. The measures of immigration flows have standardized odds ratios that rival the magnitude of any other individual- or country-level independent variable. As well, we observe sizable increases in the marginal predicted probabilities of preferences for greater spending across the observed ranges of the immigration flows measures. Further, counterfactual simulations suggest that had net migration not increased 1996-2006, preferences for greater law enforcement spending would have declined. The effects  of the immigration flows are robust when adjusting for the homicide rate and police officers, in models simultaneously including stock, and in a variety of sensitivity analyses."
"737" "In all models, percent foreign born fails to have a significant association with preferences for greater law enforcement spending. Therefore, the effects of immigration stock do not appear to be nearly as consequential as the effects of immigration flows. Preferences for greater law enforcement spending are influenced by flows, but not stock, of immigration."
"738" "Our analyses contribute to several literatures. Broadly, the literatures we discuss have traditionally focused on static comparisons across the stable ethnic composition of places (e.g. the percent African American in a place). By contrast, our study contributes to growing interest in the changing dynamics of ethnic heterogeneity ( Ceobanu and Escandell 2010; Hopkins 2010; Meuleman et al. 2009; Newman and Velez 2014) . Our DD models demonstrate the powerful effects of changes over time when controlling for stable unobserved characteristics of places."
"739" "Regarding the literatures on minority threat and the consequences of immigration, we demonstrate how accelerating flows of immigration are more consequential than the stock of immigrants. Thus, the sudden increase in immigration appears to be more influential than the level of immigration. As we explained above, the rapid change and instability of increasing immigration is arguably consistent with the subjective perception emphasized by minority threat theory. Moreover, we emphasize the salience of other aspects of minority threat besides the well-studied competitive threat. Although scholars previously studied how immigration affects trust, solidarity, social policy attitudes and anti-immigrant sentiments, we identify law enforcement preferences (and the politics of criminal justice more broadly) as a novel and salient outcome."
"740" "Our study also informs the fear of crime literature. As discussed above, there is no clear relationship between immigration and increased crime. Further, our models adjust for homicide  rates, which are not significantly associated with preferences. Therefore, the effects of immigration are not likely due to real changes in crime and security. Rather, our analyses suggest the fear of crime depends more on unfounded fears and prejudices resulting from changing ethnic heterogeneity than from reasonable concerns about safety. Though we do not observe the fear of crime directly, we posit it as a plausible mechanism between immigration, minority threat, and the politics of criminal justice. In the process, we encourage research on the consequences of the fear of crime alongside the well-studied causes ( Kin g and Wheelock  2007 )."
"741" "For the politics of criminal justice, we contribute to the study of micro-level preferences. Micro-level preferences are often implicit in political explanations of criminal justice, and many contend public opinion and the popularity of punitiveness encourage increased incarceration and policing (e.g. Enns 2014, 2016). We also contribute to the prominent theme in this literature that race and ethnicity are powerful drivers of the politics of criminal justice. Because immigration increased considerably in recent decades, and because immigration is a principal source of ethnic heterogeneity, this suggests one source of changes in criminal justice politics in recent decades. Going forward, it would be worthwhile to investigate if the well-documented turn Republican politicians took toward mobilizing criminal justice politics in the 1980s and 1990s and the ensuing incarceration boom (Beckett and Sasson 2003; Campbell and Schoenfeld 2013; Enns 2016) were linked to the simultaneous increase in immigration. Finally,   there is considerable research on the political consequences of immigration, and on how race/ethnicity influences criminal justice politics. Nevertheless, beyond the emerging literature on the criminalization of immigration (Calavita 2003; Kubrin 2013; Wacquant 1999), our investigation into how immigration affects criminal justice politics is still relatively unique. Therefore, we encourage others to incorporate immigration alongside more well-studied factors driving criminal justice."
"742" "Beyond these points, and beyond the scope of our study, we encourage  future research in three directions. First, o ne concern with the lack of significant effects for immigrant stock is that our measures are unable to distinguish country of origin. It could be that the presence of foreign born immigrants from developing regions like Africa have larger effects  (Semyonov et al. 2006). As noted above,  unfortunately data on immigrants’ country of origin are not available (see footnote 7).  However, the OECD  (2008)  has a circa-2000  estimate of the  percent  of the over - 15 - year - old population that was born in Af rica, Asia or  Latin America.   In Appe ndix  I I ,  we  estimate  multi-level logit models  in 2006  substituting   this measure  for  the overall  percent foreign born .  One should be cautious as this measure is  lagged six years before  the  ISSP, when  immigration is  increasing   in m ost  countries , and  we only have th is measure for  17  of the  25  countries .  T he  percent foreign born  from developing countries is not significant  in the first  three   model s. In  model  4 , when adjusting for  the  change in  percent foreign born , the  percent foreign born  from  Af rica, Asia and  Latin America   becomes significantly positive.   Therefore, there is some evidence   that the stock of immigrants from developing countries  does have  a   significant  association with preference s. Still, the effects are not  robust, a nd when significant, are modest  in magnitude .  I mportantly, the measures of flows  remain  significant ly positive .  Therefore, our  main  conclusions are similar even if we measure stock as immigrants from developing countries.  Nevertheless,  research  with  more precise measures of immigration  would be valuable ."
"743" "Second ,  we have  conceptually  argued that immigrati on is linked to minority threat , these are linked to the fear of crime, and the fear of crime is linked to preferences for greater law enforcement spending, which is linked to criminal justice  politics . However, we concentrate on  the  reduced,  direct relationship between immigration and preferences for greater law enforcement spending.  While beyond the scope of this paper ,  future research should investigate  the mechanisms  in this causal chain  more fully. I t would be valuable to have surveys incorporating questions about immigration and immigrants, the fear of crime, preferences for law enforcement spending, and partisan affiliation and electoral behavior.  To the best of our knowledge, unfortunately, no survey currently offers this combination of questions."
"744" "Third ,   it would be valuable to have more studies integrating micro-level preferences and  macro-level  changes  in studies of the politics of criminal justice  (Baumer et al. 2003 ; King and Wheelock 2007 ) .  For instance, given the striking  regional  patterns in  both criminal justice   and immigr a tion  across  U.S.  states   ( Barker 2009;  Campbell and Schoenfeld 2013; Jacobs and Carmichael 2001),  studies should  explore how rising immigration and state-level politics interact and shape the beliefs and preferences on individual s nested in such contexts."
"745" "In sum, this stu dy presents evidence  that  rising  flow s  of  immigration  encourage  preferences for greater spending on police and law enforcement. The  effects  of immigration flows are  generally  robust ,  and   are  substantively large  relative to   other variable s . We underline that crime rates do not have robust effects on preferences . Therefore, we conclude that without rapid increases in immigration, public preferences for greater law enforcement would  not have increased, and likely would  have  declined , especially as crime rates in most countries declined or stagnated.   Rising i mmigration  is among the most  prominent social change s   to  rich democracies in recent decades, and for most  countries , the trend s  do not seem to be abating. As a result, it is reasonable to expect immigration to continue to be a central influence on the politics of criminal justice and other public policies in the future."
