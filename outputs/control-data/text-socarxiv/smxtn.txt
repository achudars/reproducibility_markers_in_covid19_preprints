ABSTRACT
Policies excluding ethnoracial and religious minorities reinforce the power of political
elites. This study addresses an extreme case of exclusion, urban expulsions of Jews in the
medieval western Holy Roman Empire. Expulsions were official edicts proclaimed by Christian
princes, lords, or town councils, whomever ruled a territory. Changing religious and political
culture, in the form of new value on community righteousness and the beginning of
territorialization, provided incentives for polities to expel their Jewish residents. Using a new
database of Jewish settlement and city development in the Western Holy Roman Empire 10001520 CE, I show that the relational structure of political power between Christian elites could
insulate or expose Jewish communities to political contests of the time. Jews were derided, lesser
members of Christian society, but in spite of increasing focus on Christian piety and legislating
community purity, most cities did not expel their Jewish residents. City rulers that did expel were
attempting to solve challenges for sovereignty through their policies towards Jews.

A. INTRODUCTION
At its most fundamental, a society’s political conflicts concern who has what rights to
live and work within it. In many cases, ethnoracial and religious distinctions are the basis for
limited rights or exclusion. Even though these social boundary conflicts seem perennial, the
persecution of minorities is not inevitable (Moore 2007). Ethnoreligious boundaries are an
opportunity for persecution, not a prescription. In fact, the roots of a persecution may have little
direct relationship to a majority-minority divide. As Nirenberg (1996: 11) argued, “violence
against minorities is not only about minorities” (italics original); violence and exclusion are also
about majorities. The engines of persecution are often social and political processes occurring
within majority groups.
However, the conflict theory approach to studying ethnic violence brings an almost
unitary focus on the ethnic divide. Perhaps because of the nearness and moral offense of
nineteenth and twentieth century ethnic violence, the large literature on ethnic conflict has spent
decades honing theories of what conditions and processes lead to violence and war (Brubaker
and Laitin 1998; Gurr 1993). The main strands of research concern the social psychology of
ethnic groups and symbolic boundaries (Rydgren 2007; Hale 2008), the distribution of power
and resources (Hechter 2013; Wimmer 2013), and the role of movements and opportunities
(Olzak 1989; McAdam, Tarrow, and Tilly 2001) Across these foci, scholars compare groups and
the power relationships between them (Cederman, Weidmann, and Gleditsch 2011; Siroky and
Hechter 2016; Kopstein and Wittenberg 2018). Focusing on interethnic relations is most useful
for studying micro-level processes, like prejudice and discrimination (Adida, Laitin, and Valfort
2016; Hjerm, Eger, and Danell 2018; Schlueter, Schmidt, and Wagner 2008). When it comes to
studying the actions of the state and political elites, the ethnic divide is not necessarily the most

central conflict (Bush 2003). As connected to the state, the exploitation of social boundaries
serves the purposes of reinforcing power. Whose power, then, is reinforced by persecuting a
minority group? And who is that power fortified against?
In this article, I examine expulsions of Jews in the medieval western Holy Roman
Empire. In related research, Johnson and Koyama and coauthors (Finley and Koyama 2018;
Johnson and Koyama 2019; Anderson, Johnson, and Koyama 2017) have investigated
antisemitic violence in medieval Europe. They do not differentiate between expulsion and mob
violence, as they are interested in all types of religious persecution. I exclusively study
expulsions. As official proclamations by local governments mandating that a category of people
leave their homes and livelihoods, these expulsions were cases of state violence against Jews.
Expulsion edicts were obviously directed at Jews, but Jews were relatively powerless. Christians
controlled all parts of governance. Jews and Christians were not arguing over which of them
belonged in their society; Christians were in conflict with other Christians about social and
political boundaries. Understanding the expulsions requires an investigation of their political
context to identify what conflict between Christians the expulsions were part of.
Using a new dataset, I analyze expulsions in cities in the Western Holy Roman Empire
that had Jewish residents 1000-1520 CE. To explain why expulsions occurred, I ask what it was
about the majority – about Christians – that could have led to state violence against Jews.
Because expulsions were policy outcomes, I look to medieval political organization and political
economy for answers. Johnson and Koyama (2019) argue that change in the need for religious
legitimacy promoted an increase in antisemitic persecution. I argue that the nature of religious
legitimacy changed. Christian authorities felt increasingly responsible for the righteousness and
purity of their domains. Coupled with the revenue-hungry pressures of medieval political

3

Contexts of State Violence
economy, political elites jostled to assert and maintain autonomy and authority in delimited,
territorializing polities – city-states, principalities, and episcopates. Johnson and Koyama
theorize that medieval political fragmentation made weak states that used identity rules to
calibrate their administrative and fiscal capacity with their administrative and fiscal needs. I
counter that it was not government strength or weakness but political competition that drove
expulsions. I weigh specific factors of competition, including whether authority was fragmented,
that are not strictly indicators of government capacity.
Expulsions were rare, though their incidence climbed considerably from the fifteenth
century. The results of my analyses show that Jews were expelled where power and resources
were contested among political elites in the upheaval of transition to new ideals of governance.
City rulers faced ambiguous hierarchies of power and conflicting rights, challenges for
sovereignty that they attempted to solve through their policies towards Jews. This study
reinforces the interpretations of case studies of expulsions in England (Stacey 1997; Katznelson
2005) and France (Barkey and Katznelson 2011; Jordan 1989) that point to political competition
and negotiation among Christian elites. I expand on the work of Wenninger (1981) and Johnson
and Koyama (2019) by drawing attention to the role of local political institutions and
relationships amidst sovereign fiscal insecurity.
Many of our ideas for defining states and government come from studying european
territorialization through the medieval and early modern centuries. Returning to this era with a
new eye for how “the have-nots lose in disorganized politics” (Key 1950, 307) is another view
into the importance of political structures for understanding state power. In contexts of intraethnic conflict over political control, minority groups can be treated like pawns. Ethnic exclusion
and violence are intra-group weapons for the consolidation of power.

B. MEDIEVAL POLITICS
Jewish-Christian relations changed because Christian ideas and institutions changed. The
most influential changes were (1) territorialization of political dominions and (2) new and more
prescriptive theocratic understandings of Christian piety. The former provoked conflict between
rulers over resources and authority. The latter revolutionized the relationship between rulers and
their subjects by placing responsibility for community righteousness in the hands of rulers.
Together, they intensified political competition for legitimacy and control. Rights to govern and
control Jewish residency and activities were subject to the same conflicts as other rights over
privileges and authority. As individual Jews or families contracted with various towns or elites,
they “increasingly found themselves in the crossfire between competing rulers” (Haverkamp
1995: 28).
Territorialization
The main struggle for medieval polities was governance capacity. Governance capacity
primarily meant fiscal capacity, extracting enough income to maintain domains (Johnson and
Koyama 2017a; Mann 1986; Olson 1993; Tilly 1990). Income paid for household expenditures,
from food to clothing to travel, as well as staffing and contracting with other notables for
security services at home and at war and construction and upkeep on family homes and
strongholds necessary for rule. In the High Middle Ages (1000-1250 CE), over 90% of Germanic
people were legally unfree serfs, servants, and ministerials (Haverkamp 1988), whose status
implied financial burden on their overlords. Feudal lords were responsible for providing
implements, harvest-time labor, cattle, and seeds (Toch 2003). Fragmented rights (Volckart
2002) and varying resources created complicated competition over how to obtain income.

Given difficulties of extracting land-based taxes, revenues from towns were attractive to
rulers. Urban revenues were collected by impositions of fees, excise taxes, tolls, confiscation,
and new tools like annuities (Isenmann 2012; Stasavage 2011). In many urban centers, the
sources of revenue did not automatically and without question belong to one local ruler. Each
revenue stream developed from customary law and specific grants of rights. The titular city ruler
was often in competition with clerical authorities, the emperor, prominent guildsmen, and other
local elites, who may have purchased individual customs and taxation rights or been granted
them by the emperor. Further, cities were often run by agents, mortgage-holders, and/or city
councils. Local officials performed various combinations of legal, fiscal, and administrative
functions, depending on what self-governance rights were bought or bestowed on a city and local
institutional cultures (Isenmann 2012: 236). Castellans and senior administrators (Amtmänner)
were identifiable agents of an overlord. Civic juries (Schöffen), city chairmen (Bürgermeister),
and city councils (Räte) represented a peer group of local elites in legal and/or administrative
decision-making. Bailiffs (Schultheißen) enforced legal and fiscal agreements, particularly
concerning the emperor’s coffers. All of these titular and office-holding political elites were city
rulers. Urban centers had political competition built into their local governance; any mix of these
rulers might be vying for fiscal superiority or monopoly on their own behalf or as agents of a
principal.
Commercialization of sovereignty, especially through office-granting, was the foundation
of territorialization (Reichert 1996: 278). Territorialization was the erection of delimited
administration (Giddens 1987) where rulers could demand and expect compliance with taxation
and regulation (Volckart 2000) because they had pushed out or overcome their competitors. As
physical, economic, and legal borders (Boes 2007), city walls were bounds for new conflicts

6

over sole sovereignty over all city occupants and activities, including over Jews. In Cologne in
1424, the agreement to expel Jews was the cornerstone of the settlement of a nearly ten-year
conflict between the city and the archbishop over who held supreme sovereignty in the city
(Wenninger 1981). Archbishop Dietrich, elected to his post in 1414, disregarded the status quo,
established by his predecessors, that rights over Jewish residency were jointly held with the
city’s secular government. He had inherited the desire to reestablish sole sovereignty over the
whole city from the previous archbishop, his uncle Friedrich III; Archbishop Dietrich saw
disputing shared jurisdiction over Jews as an opportunity to accomplish this (ibid.: 79). His
campaign for sovereignty soon also included legal challenges to the city’s attempts to raise taxes,
which he saw as disturbing his rights over through-trade along the Rhine River, on which the city
was located. With the 1424 expulsion agreement, the relationship became friendly. The
Archbishop gave up aspirations for supremacy within the city, but he gained sole possession of
rights over the expelled Jews, whom he settled within his jurisdiction in Deutz, Bonn, and
elsewhere. From these Jews the city government had collected 18,800 Marks in taxes, not to
mention thousands of Marks via coerced direct loans, in the last 10 years alone. Archbishop
Dietrich became renowned for having “the most and richest Jews” in Germany (ibid.: 93).
New theocratic understandings of Christian piety
Christian understandings of the historical and symbolic role of Jews preserved and
enforced the social boundary between medieval Christians and Jews. Christians, living under the
new covenant with God through the death of Jesus, were accountable to canon law. Canon law
did not apply to Jews, who lived under the old covenant and Mosaic law (Dorin 2015: 119).
Christian piety relied on this contrast, both linking and distinguishing Christians from their
supposed predecessors. Sara Lipton (2014) argues that overreliance on this contrast to teach

7

Contexts of State Violence
Christian spiritual lessons was at least partially responsible for increasing European antisemitism
in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Christian relationships to Jews began to change, even
with the German bishops that had been Jews’ earliest medieval protectors. Developments in
canon law, politics, and individual rulers’ personal opinions and relationships with other political
leaders (Cluse 2013) added pressure to reorder the relationship between Christians and Jews
across continental Europe.
New developments in political philosophy pushed elites to recognize some Christian
commonality and undertake moral responsibility for those they exercised power over (Cluse
1999; Isenmann 2012: 523). By the thirteenth century, Christian holiness had become a main
concern for kings. Theological discussions in Paris, long a center of theological and legal
training, posed and probed questions of ethics of Christian rule. Graduates of the university
dispersed across Europe, taking these debates with them (Cluse 1999). King Louis IX
proclaimed himself “Rex Christianismus” (Most Christian King) and became Saint Louis for his
reformatory efforts to build a just and holy France (Jordan 1989). Pressure for holiness came
from below, too. Stow (1992: 285) argues that medieval rulers began to recognize that
absolutism could not be maintained without a show of commitment to theocratic principles of
Christian rule. Nirenberg (1996) details how rural agitators victimized Jews and lepers in a 1320
crusade and 1321 revolt that pressured French king Philip V to prioritize the moral health of his
domains, especially to reconsider fiscal policies that exacerbated poverty.
Christians began to demand more from each other (Hechter 1987), to expect a different
standard of behavior and public comportment. Appeals for Catholic unity and reform and
renewal of crusading provided support for public accountability for Christian behavior. The
fourteenth century was a century of increasing Christian disarray: abuses of power and position

8

Contexts of State Violence
within the Church, louder and louder criticism of the Church, war among secular and episcopal
powers, and schism in 1378 between allegiance to a pope in Avignon versus a pope in Rome
(Housley 2017). Church fathers saw reconciliation and Christian unity as the path to reform, and
in 1417 at the Council of Constance, they resolved to remain gathered until schism was resolved
and reform instituted (ibid.: 48). This gathering ultimately failed to accomplish these goals and
dissolved in 1418, but it established the obligation for religious and secular leaders to pursue
reform and orthodoxy. Rulers were entreated by two papal bulls in 1420 to participate in
crusading against the Hussite sect in Bohemia and against Turks in the eastern Mediterranean,
and this quickly turned to questioning rulers over why they would leave to fight when they could
attack heretics in their own jurisdictions (Rubin 1999). These new Christian ethics of lordship
amounted to compliance demands for a ruler to govern other Christians as a Christian, to
shepherd their subjects by legislating against unchristian behavior, which would threaten
Christian community holiness and health.
As best as we can tell, the 1424 expulsion in Cologne was not specifically attributable to
these new Christian political ethics. However, city councilors from the Rat attempted to use its
logic in a post-hoc justification written to King Sigismund of Germany, as yet uncrowned
emperor, seven years later in 1431 (Wenninger 1981). King Sigismund had written to the city for
an account of why the Jews were expelled and insisted that the Jews be readmitted. The Rat
members played on Cologne’s image as protector of the Christian faith (Rothkrug 1980) in order
to evade blame for their actions. After making excuses for why they had not replied earlier, the
letter authors offered that the Jews were expelled for causing religious unrest in the city:
converting ignorant Christians to Judaism, being a liability for the city to protect from

9

Contexts of State Violence
bloodthirsty anti-Hussite crusaders, lending money at interest despite a prohibition 2, degrading
the city’s reputation as one of the holiest places in Christendom and defiling it with their
unchristian feet, being rumored to be plotting to poison city wells, and more (Wenninger 1981:
94–96). The letter writers reminded King Sigismund that they had been granted privileges from
popes, emperors, and kings to do what they thought best for the city, in this case being the
eviction of the “unbelieving” Jews. The city leaders argued on the grounds of their Christian
religious responsibilities coupled with their governing responsibilities. They were justified
because they had acted to protect the moral and political order of Cologne’s Christian
community.
C. CONSEQUENCES FOR JEWS
The co-evolution of territorial control and political theology fed conflict over political
authority. Demands that a ruler change policies and institutions to be more Christian would not

2

While canon law forbade lending money at excessive interest (usury) by foreigners, a

widespread prohibition on lending money at some interest did not exist. Christian financiers,
including the Church, regularly offered loans for a price. A tidy volume on political finance in
the Holy Roman Empire covers many examples (Burgard et al. 1996), indicating the banality of
Christian participation in financial markets. The interpretation of canon law regarding what
counted as usury, and whose lending would be ignored or vilified, evolved throughout the
thirteenth to fifteenth centuries and varied across polities. For a thorough study, see Dorin
(2015). The challenge for modern scholars is a classic one: do we take complaints about usury at
face value? Or do we read into them and interpret what is unsaid? Here, the past is
incommensurable. What we do know is that Christians in finance who were not doing anything
different than Jews were not always sanctioned in the ways Jews were.

10

Contexts of State Violence
have made sense without territorialization. Territorialization spurred rulers and subjects to focus
on the boundaries of their Christian community as the borders of authority. Rulers’ obligations
were to the Christian subjects in their jurisdiction, and not to Christians outside their jurisdiction.
As rulers’ governance came under inspection, medieval Christians reconsidered whether a holy
Christian community could include Jewish residents. Jews represented God’s history of
commitment to the pious faithful, but they were also representatives of unbelief and unchristian
living (Stacey 1992). Furthermore, agitators pointed out that Jews facilitated rulers’ unchristian
financial practices (Hsia 1995). Whether their antisemitism was genuine or just a convenience,
counterelites could use this ambiguity to their advantage (Kroneberg and Wimmer 2012) by
pressing rulers to expel Jews in order to live up to their Christian responsibility. Jewish residence
became relevant to intra-Christian political competition.
Urban Jewish communities were vulnerable to expulsion because of their legal position.
Like most people in medieval Europe, Jews did not have legal rights to freedom of movement
and settlement. The emperor formally held all rights to “protect” Jews (Judenregal), including
designating which towns could accept Jews as residents and issuing communal and individual
letters assuring safe passage. These rights were farmed out, mortgaged, and granted to territorial
princes, cities, and bishoprics (Battenberg 1995; Ries 1995: 215). Authorities could choose
which Jewish individuals or families to admit and to whom to grant residency permits (Toch
2003), based on such characteristics as their wealth or trade connections, to facilitate economic
exchange locally and abroad that could be taxed to fund the local ruler. In the high medieval
period, authorities and Jews made contracts concerning residency, protection, Jewish community
contributions to town defense, and acceptance as burghers (Cluse 2009; Isenmann 2012: 140).

11

Contexts of State Violence
This classed Jews with other Päktburger, city residents under contracts, including merchants and
gentry from other cities. City authorities could revoke residency contracts as it suited them.
Given the shifting religious and political economic pressures, we would expect that rulers
everywhere in Ashkenaz began revoking residency privileges and expelling Jews. They did not.
Despite the trends in Christian morality and territorialization, most rulers maintained Jewish coresidence. Broadly, rulers’ incentives were to maintain Jewish communities because they were
easy targets for predatory fiscal policies. This function only increased in value as
territorialization stepped up competition and warfare. As Johnson and Koyama (2019) outline,
religiously-justified differential treatment of Jews was a shortcut for rulers looking to shore up or
expand their governments’ capacity.
Jewish communities were instrumentally valuable to rulers (Dorin 2015). In a sense, there
was a market for Jewish presence in a city or territory, although Jews did not have much
bargaining power over the conditions of their location. This market for Jews paralleled the
market for merchants, whom urban elites tempted to relocate by tax breaks and rights to
hereditary land ownership (Haverkamp 1988: 177–78). Jews had higher literacy and education
rates that better prepared them for financial professions, precipitating occupational shifts that
were followed with legal restrictions limiting Jews’ involvement in non-financial occupations
(Botticini and Eckstein 2005, 2012). Jews’ commercial activities provided money to a local
economy, making transactions easier to accomplish, which in turn encouraged economic activity
and more opportunities for a ruler to make, or take, money. Jewish merchant bankers also
improved import and export flows, as their connections to other Jews in cities abroad diminished
the costs and uncertainty in doing business in foreign locales. As Avner Greif (Greif 1989, 1993,
1994, 2008) has shown extensively, medieval Jewish trading networks were a reliable way to

12

Contexts of State Violence
move money and goods (though his research concerned circum-Mediterranean trade rather than
continental). Jews contributed to the commercialization of a city (Botticini 2000; Botticini and
Eckstein 2012; Johnson and Koyama 2017b), and commercialization meant more routine and
liquid income collection for rulers. Within this fiscal landscape, Jews were vulnerable to rentseeking governors (Finley and Koyama 2018; Koyama 2010). Their legal position, as essentially
possessed by whomever held Judenregal, enabled rulers to practice confiscation and predation
through taxation and forced loans. The immense financial value that rulers saw in Jews made
expulsion a rare occurrence.
Competition over authority fueled both maintaining and expelling Jews. Fights over
jurisdiction and supremacy could be funded in part by abusing Jewish communities, and these
fights were also over control of Jewish communities. A third motivation was taking over local
market power held by Jews, including the opportunity to lend to the government and profit from
the interest and the political power that flows from other political elites being beholden to you
(Ziwes 1996). Johnson and Koyama (2019) give extensive attention to the role of anti-Jewish
policies as a strategy for claiming legitimate authority. I look more deeply at the specific local
power relations that precipitated expulsions. Emperors, landgraves, bishops, guilds, and town
councils wrestled over determining the relevant authority in a patchwork landscape of
overlapping jurisdictions (Stow 1992). Expulsion was a tool to undercut rivals or assert one’s
authority (Kedar 1996), if rivals stood between the ruler and a monopoly on authority. Finley and
Koyama (2018) produced an excellent study of how the macro-level political competition in the
Holy Roman Empire affected the persecution of Jews. But there was significant variation in local
political and economic structures. The focus of this study is the association between expulsions
and the potential for local authority contests. In short, I argue that Jewish communities were

13

Contexts of State Violence
more likely to be expelled where authority was contested, and different local structures yielded
more or less insecurity for Jewish communities.
One layer of competition occurred among political elites within a polity (see Table 1).
Characteristics of each title, office, or the constellation of claimants to authority could tip the
balance of competition in favor of one body or another. In free and imperial cities and episcopal
cities, where the bishop was installed by a cathedral chapter, the choice of governing officials
might be subject to political maneuvering among elites with voting rights; a new official might
be beholden to campaign promises or vulnerable to attacks by a faction within the city elite.
Civic moral reforms and Jewish expulsions could be legitimizing and defensive. In cities ruled
by religious authorities, these rulers might feel even stronger pressure to demonstrate their
Christian ethics of lordship, lest they be criticized by a reforming civil servant with mutinous
aspirations. Thus, despite strong instrumental incentives to maintain a local Jewish community,
local political contestation may have incentivized expulsion.

If this were the case, then I expect a higher incidence of expulsion in cities where
multiple authorities claim rights of rule. In some places, this might have manifested as multiple
lords sharing dominion, directly by fragmented rights or fiefs or indirectly through mortgages of
rights. In others, conflicting claims to rule might be between local political administrations, like
a Rat or Schöffen, and the agents of another, like the Schultheißen, castellans, and Amtmänner
that were agents of the overlord (Isenmann 2012: 216). Relatedly, the conflict might have been
between a city with local administrators and a resident overlord who might try to exert more
absolutist, direct rule (Hechter 2013). Local contestation may have been higher where more
revenue was at stake (Bueno de Mesquita and Bueno de Mesquita 2018), and there was a greater
prize to be won by pushing out rivals.
Another layer of competition was between the local government and external rivals,
including neighboring cities or lords, peers, or even the Holy Roman Emperor. Jews were under
the jurisdiction of the Roman crown, no matter what city or village they lived in; expulsions of
Jews asserted a polity’s territorial independence, against the authority of the Holy Roman
Emperor (Stow 1992). Imperial cities, which were granted self-governance by the emperor, or
imperial immediacy, had on-going conflict with the emperor and his agents about how much
independence they really had. Expulsion would be especially likely in these cities, which had
more opportunities for intra-city strife on top of their struggles with the emperor. City rulers
might expel Jews to spite any number of rivals, from the pope and the imperial regime
(Haverkamp 1999) to local overlords to other cities. 3

In 1515, Andernach expelled a Jewish family right after the Archbishop of Cologne had settled

them there, disputing the right of the Archbishop to do so (Maimon, Breuer, and Guggenheim
1987). Conversely, in 1495 Jews were arrested in Münster bei Bingen as part of a dispute

15

Contexts of State Violence
In other circumstances, inter-ruler warfare and politicking might stretch a ruler’s fiscal
capacity to the point that expulsion and confiscation of Jewish assets outweighed any incentives
to preserve Jews as insurance against future financial needs (Jordan 1998; generally, see Levi
1983, 1988; Olson 1993). Seizing the property of Jews was rewarding enough for France’s Philip
II (Barkey and Katznelson 2011) that he did it twice. The Trier cathedral chapter estimated that
expulsion there in 1418 generated 60,000 florins (and they wondered where their cut of the
profits were) (Maimon, Breuer, and Guggenheim 1987). Conflict might decrease the ruler’s
discount rate on the value of Jewish residents, and the more desperate they were, the less it
would matter how much the confiscation netted, as long as it was something. Since before the
beginning of the millennium, German princes and families had been squabbling and warring over
territory and succession (Haverkamp 1988). Alliances swapped with marriages, unexpected
desertion, and negotiations over the office of emperor and inheritances. Cities and territorial
rulers formed Bunde, alliances based on time-delimited pledges or treaties, to become blocs that
enforced military peace, promoted trade, or bargained collectively with the emperor about noninterference - including with tax collection (Distler 2006; Isenmann 2012). A Bund marked a
détente with other members. If the alliance brought stability and peace to a city, the
government’s discount rate on the instrumental value of its Jewish community might rise again,
preserving the community’s residence in the city.
With all these dynamics in mind, let’s return to the case of Cologne. In the early fifteenth
century, the Cologne Jewish community had high instrumental value to both the city and the
Archbishop. Coerced loans to city coffers helped the city spread the costs of regional warfare
between the Pfalzgraf (overlord in Münster bei Bingen) and the city of Bingen (home of several
of the arrested Jews) (Mentgen 2016).

16

into peacetime (Mann 1986: 430) and stabilize city finances in the middle of a war-related
economic downturn (Wenninger 1981: 83–86). City rulers raised import and export taxes,
depressing economic production of food staples for local consumption and revenues on shipping.
The city extracted 22.3% of its direct loans 1414-1424 from the Jewish community (ibid.: 92), a
sizeable financial tool the city council would not have easily parted with. At the same time,
Archbishop Dietrich himself had attempted to fine both the Jews and the city to pay for his own
war costs, but the Jews took him to court three times to contest his jurisdiction to do so. Under
mediation by Duke Adolf of Jülich-Berg to end the ten-year feud between the city and the new
archbishop Dietrich, the parties reconsidered whether Jews’ rights of residence should be
extended. The Archbishop offered to remunerate the city for in return for expulsion. The
agreement to expel the Jews resolved taxation and reparation disputes between city and the
Archbishop, helped each to meet their financial goals, allowed the city to avoid continued
jurisdictional conflict with the Archbishop over the Jews, and gave the impression that the
Archbishop was expressing his rights over the Jews by forcing them to be relocated from the city
and into his other territories. The expulsion further allowed Archbishop Dietrich to save face
after being called out by name in 1422 by Pope Martin V for fighting other Germans instead of
participating in crusading against unbelievers (Housley 2017: 59). Expulsion served the fiscal
and political aims of the city of Cologne and the Archbishopric of Cologne.
D. DATA AND METHOD
Case studies can highlight the specific institutional contexts and political contests in
individual cities and their connections to policies for Jewish residence. However, Jews lived in
hundreds of German cities, and were expelled from over 100, making overall comparison based
on historical narrative alone cognitively difficult. Further, we have limited information for many

17

Contexts of State Violence
German cities about Jewish communities or any contention about their residence. I use a
quantitative approach in order to explore which structural conditions for political competition
were more likely to produce expulsions, based on sparse information about each city rather than
detailed histories.
For city-level data on politics, economics, and Jewish communities, I translated and
digitized Geschichte der Juden im Mittelalter von der Nordsee bis zu den Südalpen (Haverkamp
2002), a compendium covering cities with Jewish settlement roughly from the Meuse River in
the west to the easternmost tributaries of the Rhine River and from the North Sea to the Southern
Alps. This region was the heart of historic Ashkenaz, which stretched across parts of the modern
countries of the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria, and Italy. See
Figure 1 for a map.4 The dataset is structured in the same manner as Geschichte der Juden,
which is in century and half-century increments: 1000-1100, 1101-1200, 1201-1250, 1251-1300,
1301-1350, 1351-1400, 1401-1450, 1451-1500, 1501-1520. Organizing by city and by period is
advantageous because many pieces of information about medieval cities are traceable to a period
but fuzzy on the specific year.
Besides recording the locations of Jewish settlement and expulsions, Geschichte der
Juden encodes: (1) the sovereign(s) and polity authority type (ecclesiastical, free or imperial,
territorial lord or prince, or non-urban); (2) indicators of the development of Jewish community

4

Jewish settlement was not random, since Jews needed permission to live in a city. Since this

study is restricted to cities where Jews lived, I assume that factors for Jewish migration to a town
are relatively consistent and do not affect one town more than another. The spatial pattern
follows the overall distribution of towns, with generally greater density of settlement in
southeastern German lands and along the Rhine.

and ritual infrastructure (organized community, community leaders, official seal, cemetery,
synagogue, mikveh, community center, hospital, Jewish quarter); (3) occurrence of persecutions,
both period-specific (e.g., Plague persecutions) and perennial (e.g., ritual murder accusations);
(4) urban defensive, economic, and political development; and (5) lordly privileges over Jewish
subjects.
Geschichte der Juden distinguishes between certain and uncertain Jewish presence in a
city, based on the types of sources and corroboration between multiple sources. Additionally, the
collection notes whether settlements were “non-urban,” meaning they did not develop into cities
of much substance during the time period. The database excludes cities with uncertain Jewish
settlement as well as non-urban settlements. Most non-urban settlements have little additional
information recorded besides Jewish presence; their small size likely means that there were few
contemporary records about them and even fewer records that survived to the present. Non-urban
locales were too small to have the institutional, economic, and political development under study
here. The resulting dataset is an unbalanced panel that includes only as many cities in a period as
had Jewish residents. Table 2 enumerates the temporal distribution of observations of the 811
cities in this study.5 Descriptive statistics are presented in table 3.

5

Geschichte der Juden is based on the third volume of Germania Judaica (Maimon, Breuer, and

Guggenheim 1987) plus extensive re-examination of previous volumes and additional sources
produced since the first two volumes were completed. Germania Judaica is the source for recent
studies of medieval antisemitic persecution. This study is more geographically and temporally
inclusive than those of Voigtländer and Voth, who limited themselves to the 1938 borders of
Germany and matches to other data (325 cities), and Finley and Koyama, who restrict their

Dependent Variable: Expulsion
For this study, the dependent variable is whether or not a local expulsion occurred.
Geschichte der Juden catalogues years of confirmed, attempted, and uncertain expulsions on the
local and territorial scale. I excluded attempted and uncertain expulsions, territorial expulsions,
and expulsions with unknown dates.
Political Contestation
The argument in this study leaves open which specific institutions or authority
competitions would be most dangerous for Jewish communities. We have limited theory and
empirics in this regard. Recent work is most likely to investigate the development of
representative institutions and to ask whether representation was advantageous to a polity’s
economy (Stasavage 2007, 2016; Wahl 2019). Participatory institutions were but one facet of
medieval urban political systems, just as in today’s cities and states. Therefore, this study
includes both theoretically-motivated measures and exploratory measures of political economies.
Sovereignty. To measure contestation over sovereignty within a city, I coded types of rulers,
whether rule was shared, and whether rulership changed. From the timeline of sovereignty, I
tallied and categorized rulers over a city within each period using binary, non-exclusive coding,
since multiple individuals or bodies might have claims over a city during a period, either at the

sample to cities whose entries in Volume II of Germania Judaica mention the Black Death
Plague in the years 1340-1350 (340 cities).

20

same time or through a transfer of sovereignty. This method differs from the typical
measurement (Anderson, Johnson, and Koyama 2017; Cantoni and Yuchtman 2014; Finley and
Koyama 2018; Kim and Pfaff 2012; Pfaff 2013; Voigtländer and Voth 2012) that does not allow
for overlapping categorizations, even though shared authority was not an anomaly. The possible
21

Contexts of State Violence
ruler types were numerous: archbishop, bishop, religious house, religious foundation, imperial,
free, king, prince, lord, minor nobility, city, and others (usually individual financiers who held
mortgages over the city). Examining frequencies of cities and expulsion by ruler type helped to
narrow the list of which ruler types to include, and I settled on including free, imperial, prince,
bishop, and archbishop as dichotomous measures of who ever held sovereignty rights within the
period. These cover the majority of observations and expulsions and represent a range of ranks
among the nobility and clergy. Because these are binary, they indicate different types of
authority and contrast different packages of incentives.
To distinguish between shared or sole sovereignty and capture any effects of direct
competition over sovereignty, I use the mean count of sovereignty claimants per year in a period.
Values near or equal to one indicate that sovereignty was rarely shared, or not at all during the
period. High values (approximately 5 or 6) represent very fractured sovereignty rights. Moderate
values (approximately 2 or 3) might represent frequent power-sharing or a mix of years of sole
sovereignty with years of highly fragmented sovereignty. Additionally, I noted whether the city
was the residence of (one of) its sovereign(s) (1) or not (0).
Sovereignty transitions were an opportunity for political conflict. I coded types of
transitions between sovereigns within a period. These transitions occurred through mortgages,
sales, changes in feudal rights, treaties, conquests, deaths, marriages, and more. Since I am
interested in political contestation, I include a count of political transitions, that is, those due to
treaties or conquests. Additionally, I count the number of sovereignty transitions that occurred
through mortgages of sovereignty rights. This is another method for understanding a ruler’s
fiscal needs.

Political Institutions. To understand the potential role of individual political offices, I recorded
the presence (1) or absence (0) of the following local political offices: castellan, civic jury
(Schöffen), bailiff (Schultheiß), city chairman (Bürgermeister), and city council (Rat). Likewise,

23

Contexts of State Violence
I recorded the presence (1) or absence (0) of two types of local administration rights: selfjurisdiction (Stadtrecht) and high jurisdiction, which was the right to try serious crimes and
utilize the death penalty. These offices indicate the level of local involvement in political
decision-making. None is a direct substitute for the others.
Alliances. Regional political cooperation in Bünde created blocs of mutual aid. Assurances that a
ruler could rely on troops furnished by others may have diminished the importance of Jews as a
tax source. Membership in any alliances, such as the Swabian League, the Decapolis (Alsace), or
the Rhenish League, was recorded by year from the detailed work of Distler (2006). I summed
the count of regional alliance agreements for each city across all prior periods. The Hanseatic
League, a trade-based alliance, is not considered in this measure.
Instrumental Value of Jewish Communities
Underlying my argument about political dynamics are the importance of commercial
economic development and the potential for revenue collection in a city. I include measures of
each of these, in line with previous economic arguments about the purely economic reasons for
expulsion (Barzel 1992) or persecution (Becker and Pascali 2019).
Commercial Development. Maintaining a Jewish community for their instrumental value would
be less important if a city had lively commercial activity outside of what was facilitated by
Jewish merchants. Geschichte der Juden includes whether a city was known to have a market or
market rights. I recoded the number and type of markets into an ordinal measure of market
development: no markets (0), one market or a generic record of market rights (1), multiple
markets (2), any number of fairs (3). The benefit of keeping the scale truncated in this manner, as
compared to a count of markets or fairs, is that having outliers on number of markets or fairs is
not actually helpful for the analysis, and often the reference is to plural markets rather than a

24

Contexts of State Violence
specific number. As an indicator of commercial potential, I include a count of how many
approximated medieval trade and pilgrimage routes (Bossak and Welford 2015) pass within 5
kilometers of each city; this is constant across periods.
Substitutes for Expropriating from Jews. As I laid out, a significant deterrent to expelling Jews
was the perception of how valuable it might be to maintain their presence for on-going financial
exploitation, or to confiscate everything from them at a future time of greater fiscal need. If a
ruler had other options for confiscating from cultural others or formalized mechanisms for
regular income, Jews would have less instrumental value. The Geschichte der Juden catalogue
mentions when foreign merchant-bankers (Lombards or Cahorsins) were active in a city. I code
this as presence (1) or absence (0) for foreign financiers. I used keywords to code the presence
(1) or absence (0) of toll and tariff collection and minting. Keyword coding was validated
manually and corrected as necessary.
Other Independent Variables
Christian Religious Institutionalization. Historical religiosity is difficult to operationalize. 6 One
tactic is to code for whether religion-based authority was institutionalized into city governance.
While others have differentiated between cities hosting bishoprics versus not, it is more accurate
to consider whether any rights to sovereignty in a city were held by a religious authority. I
captured this through the sovereignty coding for bishop and archbishop mentioned above.

6

Similar to Kim and Pfaff (2012), I first calculated the number of religious communities

recorded in a city as a representation of the potential visibility and importance of religious
ideology in civic life. Unfortunately, this information was absent or else impenetrably recorded
as “various” for some of the most notable cities.

25

Contexts of State Violence
Additionally, I coded whether a city was the seat of a diocese (1) or not (0). Bishops and
archbishops did not always possess sovereignty over the seats of their dioceses, and the previous
measure would miss these cities with intense presence of clergy, religious orders, pilgrims,
relics, and religious symbolism. This metric may be the closest to capturing public religious
vitality with the information contained in Geschichte der Juden.
Jewish Community Infrastructure. Finley and Koyama (2018) used the binary existences of
synagogues, cemeteries, mikvehs, and Jewish quarters to represent community wealth. 7 I created
a cumulative measure of community infrastructure by summing the presence of synagogues,
cemeteries, mikvehs, and Jewish quarters, resulting in a range from 0 to 4. This index of
community infrastructure reduces otherwise dichotomous variation into one dimension that
separates cities with less-developed Jewish communities, which were likely smaller, from more
developed communities, which were likely larger.
Other Persecutions and Pogroms. Jews in the Middle Ages faced a variety of persecutions,
including Crusades massacres, ritual murder accusations, host desecration accusations, and
extortion. To account for the effect of local histories of persecution, I record the total
persecutions of any kind in the previous period and the total expulsions or attempted expulsions
in the previous period.
Time. Time period is recorded categorically in dummy variables, with the first period (10001100) as the referent category in order to draw contrasts between the earliest time period and

7

I am hesitant to assert that these artifacts of community development represent wealth.

Certainly some Jewish communities did invest wealth in their ritual infrastructure, but the
underlying historical data does distinguish between a grandiose synagogue and a plain one.

26

Contexts of State Violence
which later periods might have a higher risk of expulsion, as some experts give reason to expect
(Müller 2002).
Analytical Approach
Since expulsions occurred in 5.6% of the sample (116 observations), and furthermore
because so many of the independent variables are non-normally distributed and/or dichotomous,
the usual logistic regression approaches produce unreliable estimates for the relationships
between expulsion and the independent variables. The computational problem for frequentist
logistic regression is that sparseness - not all possible combinations are represented in the data,
and many occur very few times - results in separation on the dependent variable. That is, there
were no expulsions under some condition sets, and some condition sets are always associated
with expulsions. Frequentist logistic regression calculations either overfit the model or, in my
case, do not converge.
Instead, I implement Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian logistic regression. Bayesian
logistic regression solves the problem by considering that the sample data are drawn from
distributions of the covariates; supplying these prior distributions supplements the sample data to
give limited information about potential condition sets that are not represented in the sample.
The results are posterior distributions of all observed variables, dependent and independent,
conditional on the prior distributions and the observed distributions. The posterior distributions
tell us how realistic our expectations are, given our observations.
I use weakly informative priors and scale all non-dichotomous variables to be centered at
0 with a standard deviation of 0.5. To address the non-independent nature of observations in this
panel data, I use a hierarchical specification with observations pooled by city. The modeling
procedure involves 5 independent chains of 5,000 iterations, including 2,500 warm-up iterations

27

Contexts of State Violence
per chain. All chains converged and mixed well, and the potential scale reduction factor for each
variable in the model is less than 1.01. Further information on model details, convergence, and
posterior checks, including robustness to removing outliers, are included in the appendix.
E. RESULTS
Expulsion was a relatively rare event, though not rare enough in terms of its human
consequences. Expulsions were very uncommon before the fourteenth century; Geschichte der
Juden noted only 4 urban expulsions prior to 1301 (Mainz 1012, Bingen 1198/1199, Lyon 1250,
and Bern 1294). Excepting Plague-related expulsions 1348-1350, 16 expulsions were ordered
before the fifteenth century. After this point, the frequency of expulsions increased dramatically,
with the height of expulsions in the period 1451-1500, during which 46 cities conducted 47
expulsions (see table 4).

For an initial look at political competition, we can check the probabilities of expulsion for
different authority and institution conditions. Figure 2 compares rates of expulsions for those that
had and did not have different types of authority structures or institutions. Without conditioning
on any other variables, there is a high level of variation in whether the political structures
correspond to differences in expulsion rates. Consistent with previous studies and with my

28

Contexts of State Violence
arguments, the rate of expulsion was higher in free cities and imperial cities. Expulsions also
happened more often in cities where rulers resided. For the different offices and local
institutions, some had positive associations with expulsion, while others had negative
associations. These comparisons do not attend to the panel structure of the data or the covariation
of city conditions. Bayesian regression provides a more careful analysis.

FIGURE 2. Probabilities of Expulsion Under Different Local Political Conditions

Since the results of logistic regressions are conditional on which variables are included,
and the magnitudes of the effects are not comparable between different specifications (Breen,
Karlson, and Holm 2018), in Table 5 I present the results of a single model that includes all the
theorized and exploratory variables. Results from Bayesian regression analyses are slightly
different from frequentist regression. The results describe the posterior distributions, which are
the distributions of coefficients describing the relationships between independent variables and
the dependent variable. Posterior medians are the median estimated coefficients of change in the

29

Contexts of State Violence
log-odds of expulsion. Credibility intervals capture a specified proportion of the density of the
posteriors, centered around the medians. Since the model was estimated using partially scaled
data, as described above, the posterior medians indicate the change in log-odds for the presence
(=1) of each binary variable and for the mean plus two standard errors for each continuous
variable. Full results are in Table A1. For comparison, Table A1 also includes results from two
nested models: one with only control variables and a second with controls plus dominion
categories and economic attributes. To aid interpretation, figure 3 visualizes a selection of effects
translated into changes in probability of expulsion.
Formal Sovereignty
A few conditions set up a balance of power that was more likely to victimize Jewish
communities. Most other studies have used categorization of authority type as an indicator of
political contestation. However, as I have established, authority was split much of the time, with
cities having as many as six different rulers in a given year. To address this, I examined the mean
count of sovereignty claimants per year in a period. I observe the opposite pattern of what I
expected. More rulers competing for control was better for Jewish communities. A higher mean
count of rulers per year was associated with a lower incidence of expulsion; the odds of
expulsion decrease 52% (decrease of 0.74 in log-odds) for a shift in the mean count of rulers
from 1.27 (mean) to 2.31 (two standard errors above the mean). Sixteen of 116 expulsions
occurred when sovereignty was shared. Further, Jews were less safe in cities where rulers were
in residence. This appears to indicate that more direct, less contested sovereignty increased the
precarity of Jewish communities. The odds of expulsion in a city when the ruler lived there were
274% higher (log-odds increased by 1.32) than cities where the ruler(s) lived elsewhere.

30

Contexts of State Violence
The types of rulers mostly did not matter, but the relationship between a city’s rulers and
other external powers did matter. Imperial cities were nearly 30% more likely to expel Jews
(180% increase in odds, 28 of 116 expulsions). These were cities where the Holy Roman
Emperor had some direct authority, setting the city up for conflict between local elites and the
distant emperor. Likewise, geopolitics imperiled Jews. Cities where a transition of sovereignty
happened politically, via treaty or conquest, were more likely to expel. One political sovereignty
transition (about four standard errors above the mean of approximately 0) increases the log-odds
by about 1.24, an increase of 246% in the odds of expulsion. The measurement strategies of this
study are validated: more detailed measurement reveals that rulers’ holds on sovereignty
mattered for the survival of Jewish communities.
Local Political Institutions
Beyond formal rights of sovereignty, what happened on the ground, in terms of the actual
institutional maintenance of political and territorial control, led to differential outcomes for
Jewish communities. Looking at local offices and self-administration, the odds of expulsion with
Schöffen are 88% less than without; the odds with a castellan are 82% less than without. These
two offices had the largest association, negative or positive, with whether a city expelled its
Jews. Other local institutions (Schultheiß, Rat, Burgermeister) were not related to the expulsions.
More detailed historical investigation is needed to understand the importance and nonimportance of each of these offices. Possession of Stadtrechte or high justice privileges also did
not impact whether or not a Jewish community was expelled. Neither was a history of
participation in regional alliances connected to expulsion, though I had reasoned that Bunde, by
promoting geopolitical and economic security, would diminish the temptation to expel in order to

31

Contexts of State Violence
confiscate. The posterior distributions for these no-relationship variables are consistent with zero
effect.

Fiscal Opportunities
Turning to the financial side of sovereignty pressures, expulsion was more likely in cities
where local rulers could manipulate their revenues using tools of absolutism. Rulers who had

32

Contexts of State Violence
minting rights could simply coin more money, if they needed cash. For cities that had mints, the
odds of expulsion are 136% higher. Similarly to the fiscal position of Jews, city governors could
up the tax rates on foreign moneylenders’ activities or extort them for the privilege to continue
business without much interference, since the foreigners did not have political power. For cities
that had granted residency to foreign moneylenders, the odds are 270% higher. The presence of
either could substitute for financial extraction from Jews and diminish the opportunity costs for
expulsion. However, greater market development and trade-favorable location on roads had no
relationship with expulsions, either to promote or suppress them. Commercial activity and access
did not increase or decrease the instrumental value of Jewish communities. It was the structure of
political control over fiscal resources that mattered for policy regarding Jews, not simply the
fiscal potential of a city.
The Role of Christian Values
The exercise of Christian piety as reforming and purifying lordship expanded theocracy
beyond bishops and archbishops to any ruler who embraced it. Purification expressed as
persecution and exclusion of Jews granted Christian moral authority to any ruler. Indeed, rule by
a bishop or archbishop had no relationship with expulsion; the special moral authority of
belonging to the Church hierarchy did not provide special motivation to expel Jews. The seat of a
diocese was also not more likely to expel Jews, even though the concentration of clergy and
monastic life, pilgrims, and religious history could have made community purification more
urgent and successful. It is striking that secular and clerical rulers were equally unlikely to expel
Jews. Rather, expulsions became more common across all cities from the fifteenth century on, as
the pressures for territorialization grew.

33

Contexts of State Violence
The link between Jewish community development and expulsion provides further support
for my argument. City rulers were more likely to expel Jewish communities that built more
community and ritual infrastructure. Visible non-Christian otherness may have been counter to
moral authority in a Christian city, or it may have highlighted the opposing power of the emperor
within a city’s own walls, or perhaps the rulers simply needed an influx of revenues from
confiscation. Each of these mechanisms is consistent with the overall story that polity leaders
were acting to consolidate territorial rule.

F. DISCUSSION
The constellation of sovereignty was a factor in historical European antisemitic
persecutions (Anderson, Johnson, and Koyama 2017; Barkey and Katznelson 2011; Finley and

34

Contexts of State Violence
Koyama 2018; Jordan 1989, 1998; Katznelson 2005; Stacey 1988, 1997) and religious change
(Pfaff and Corcoran 2012). This study replicates some of these findings. Further, it aims to
capture the complexities and coexisting rights in urban spaces by including a wider range of
political offices and institutions. The structure of political power clearly impacted the survival of
Jewish communities. There is no straightforward story about which configurations of power
were most damaging to Jews because roles and rights were so inconsistent. It was exactly this
absence of formulas that made Jews vulnerable.
Dominion and sovereignty were not straightforward in medieval Europe, including in
German lands. Sovereignty did not follow the hierarchical structure of many of today’s states;
relationships between towns, princes, and the Holy Roman Emperor were case-specific. The
contrast between imperial cities and free cities highlights how the lack of a norm for cityemperor relationships harmed Jewish communities. These two types of cities had two different
relationships to the emperor and territorial control. The absent emperor could, at any time, assert
direct rule (Hechter 2013) over an imperial city and interfere with local goings-on, but free cities
were relatively autonomous. The difference between these two approximates the difference
between de jure and de facto autonomy. Jewish residency was less stable in imperial cities,
where city autonomy was not formalized, where the city governors and the emperor had ongoing clashes over who was ultimately in charge.
Conflicting rights were a key source of medieval contention. The general argument of
this paper has been that political competition among Christians produced negative outcomes for
Jews. However, instead of local political fragmentation leading to persecution, as Johnson and

35

Contexts of State Violence
Koyama (2019) contend, Jews fared better where there were many rights-claimants.8 Corulership might be due to complicated inheritance, mortgaging and pledging (short-term and
long-term), treaties, or any combination of these, making it tough to characterize what sorts of
cities were more likely to have shared rule. With more parties, the financial rewards to rule are
divided ever smaller, and coordination on any policy is increasingly difficult, leaving little
political incentive to expel. Further, more parties means it is less clear which Christians would
benefit and which would lose. Here, the unsystematic nature of medieval German politics
worked to preserve Jewish communities.
Power relationships vis-à-vis local institutions were similarly irregular. Jewish
communities were more likely to be preserved where a castellan or college of Schöffen guarded
civic peace. A castellan indicates an absentee sovereign who left an empowered agent to act in
her or his name to govern castle affairs. This may have been a situation of stronger centralized
control or lesser economic importance, both of which would be contexts of fewer rivals to
political and economic power. Schöffen supplied a city government with legal capacity. Greater
importance of law could be a conservative force for interreligious toleration because customary
law was an alternative to religion-based rule (Johnson and Koyama 2013, 2019); new religious
claims about purifying a city of unchristian behavior, and the claims on political legitimacy made
therewith, would be less likely to stick.

Jewish communities in cities with a greater number of rulers were not more likely to experience

a pogrom instead of expulsion. Among cities with a greater than average (1.27) mean count of
rulers, the proportion of cities where Jews were victims of pogroms but not expulsions (39.7%)
is no different from the proportion of cities that had expulsions and pogroms (43.8%).

Territorialization, and dominion more broadly, required as regular and certain access to
cash as a governor could manage. This study supports previous research indicating that rulers
and cities had financial motivations for maintaining or expelling Jews (Barzel 1992; Katznelson
2005; Miethke 2011; Veitch 1986). Commercialization provided financial opportunities, but only
if the necessary bureaucracy and enforcement was in place. I did not find that general
commercial development (Rubin 2014; Wahl 2016a) was related to policies of Jewish exclusion.
Jews were expelled from cities where rulers could avoid bargaining with counterelites about new
revenues and rates, where rulers had foreign moneylenders and minting as ready alternatives to
exploiting Jews.9 Captive resources, like Jews, or foreigners who needed permission for
residency and business activity, or mints, would have been more reliably manipulated. Economic
complementarity is a documented inhibitor of popular ethnic violence (Jha 2013, 2014; Landa
2016), but here the violence was undertaken by the government. Rather than complementarity
between Christians and Jews (Becker and Pascali 2019), the dynamics are of substitutability for
exploitation towards the purposes of rulers.
In the midst of these political struggles, the new Christian theocratic responsibility for
moral guardianship did amount to a new attempt at a formula for sovereignty. Religion-based
claims can be powerful legitimation for rule (Rubin 2017; Johnson and Koyama 2019). The
motivating logic of purifying and protecting a city’s Christian community, whether convenient or
truly felt, was equally available to Christian and lay rulers, an effect of the democratization of

9

Among cities with Jewish residents, the proportion of cities where foreign moneylenders were

recorded did not increase over time but decreased from the fifteenth century. The proportion of
cities with mints was essentially constantly about 20%. Any substitution that occurred was not a
broader temporal trend.

37

European Christianity (FitzGerald 2017). Laypeople were invigorating Christianity, joining
monastic organizations as unvowed laborers, forming their own urban charitable communities,
developing new saint cults (Pfaff 2013; Rothkrug 1980), and building new parish churches from
local donations and labor (Creasman 2002; Minty 1996). These energies continued to the point
of schism and prolonged warfare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries (Scribner 1991). In
spite of new religious political ethics, though, preservation of Jewish communities was the
default for Christian and secular rulers. Whatever religious motivations there were for
expulsions, these motivations were never held so strongly that Jews were expelled everywhere.
G. CONCLUSION
This study is one more examination of European state-making in a rich social science
tradition on the subject. Here, my focus is how managing social difference fit into medieval
political development. I outlined how two long-run processes – territorialization and changes in
political theology – created insecurity for Jewish communities. The argument and empirical
focus of this paper is that these long-run processes did not have consistent effects on the position
of Jewish communities but were contingent on local political economies. Johnson and Koyama
(2019) describe how the changing value placed on religious legitimacy promoted antisemitic
violence. With rather large city-by-city variation in sovereignty rights and political organization,
though, we should be more attentive to what it was about different local governments that
brought the need for religious legitimacy or capacity-building to the fore. That is what this study
offers: exploration of how specific local structures mattered for the security of Jewish
communities.
Each local institution and privilege does not align with a particular political regime or
position within German lands; each of them provides independent information about the political

and economic incentives and opportunities for rulers. Disaggregating city political and economic
institutions (Wahl 2016b, 2019) reveals relationships to Jewish community survival that would
be obscured by focusing on autonomy (Stasavage 2014) or regime structures (Blank, Dincecco,
and Zhukov 2017) alone. Essentially, though, explanations relying on sovereignty types and
autonomy describe political competition as endogenous to political institutions. By investigating
which specific structures mattered in this case, I provide impetus for reexamination of other
phenomena tied to pre-modern European political competition. As Liddy (2017) recently detailed
about fifteenth-century England, even seemingly autocratic systems can have intense political
conflict within and between layers of government, down to individual cities. Contestation
happens at lower levels of political systems, too, not just at the highest levels.
When looking at expulsions from cities, or any other case of state violence against
minority groups, we need to keep in mind the whole spectrum of the political order. Competition
over power and resources between factions of any type (Clark 1998; Gill and Keshavarzian
1999; Lachmann 1989) can affect the content and salience of an ethnic boundary (Hechter 1987;
Stewart 2018; Wimmer 2013). In the case of the medieval Holy Roman Empire, the political
system bred uncertainty about governance rights, which in turn fed struggles among Christian
elites. Some of these resorted to persecuting Jewish communities by expelling Jews from their
cities to bolster claims to sovereignty and mitigate financial problems. They used ethnic
cleansing of Jews support their positions and possessions.

APPENDIX
Details of Bayesian Logistic Regression
In this study, Bayesian generalized linear mixed models provide advantages over
frequentist linear models. Bayesian models are joint probability models for all variables.
Incorporating prior distributions into the estimation builds in some variability that may not be
represented in the specific observations in a sample. Ultimately, this produces results based on
more information than traditional regression. In this case, the results are more precise and
reliable. To specify and estimate the hierarchical Markov Chain Monte Carlo Bayesian logistic
regression model, I use the rstanarm package 2.13.1 (Stan Development Team 2018a) in R.
Following the advice of the Stan Development Team (2018b), Gelman, Jakulin, Pittau, and Su
(2008), and Betancourt (2017), I use weakly informative priors, the Student’s t distribution
(df=7, scale=2.5). All five chains converged and mixed well. For converged models, the
potential scale reduction factor ℛ̂ for each variable in the model should be is less than 1.05, and
the values for this model are all less than 1.01. Full results for posterior distributions are in Table
A1, with model details and convergence information in Tables A2 and A3. Pareto-smoothed
importance sampling leave-one-out cross-validation (PSIS-LOO) and period-stratified exact Kfold validation, implemented through the loo package for R (Vehtari et al. 2018; Vehtari,
Gelman, and Gabry 2017), confirms that the posterior distributions are stable to iterative
omissions of observations and reestimation (all Pareto k <0.7).
