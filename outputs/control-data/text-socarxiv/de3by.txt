Abstract

Dengue is currently regarded globally as the most important mosquito-borne viral disease. The true impact of dengue globally is difficult to ascertain due to factors such as inadequate disease surveillance, misdiagnosis, and low levels of reporting. Currently available data likely grossly underestimates the social, economic, and disease burden. Estimates of the global incidence of dengue infections per year have ranged between 50 million and 200 million; however, recent estimates using cartographic approaches suggest this number is closer to almost 400 million. There are about 6,031 research papers collectively contributed by 22,234 scientists published in 6007 scientific periodicals in recent 8 years as the focus on this fever attracts attention of Scientists at the considerable rate.  The present paper attempts to check the applicability of Price’s Law on the citations of 6031 global publications on Dengue.  The study lights on the trend of scientific productivity, h-index and productivity of authors, the total citation sum of top cited journals are scientifically analysed.
  Key Words:  Scientometrics,  Citation analysis, Price Index, h-index,  Dengue Research output, 
Introduction
Scientometric is an important field in information science as it represents a unique set of techniques and tools for the monitoring and analysis of information resources and for the management of knowledge in social and organizational contexts. The Present study is a Scientometric analysis on Dengue fever Research Publications globally over the recent period of 2010 to 2017. An attempt has been made in this study to find out the various characteristics of Dengue fever literature such as average growth rate of literature, the output of scientists in terms of h-index and their citation pattern. In addition the price index on the citations that the scientists referred.  
Objective measures of journal influence are based mostly on citation counts. The basic idea is that influential journals are the recipients of many citations from other journals. If a journal publishes an article that is cited by articles in other journals, it contributes to the exchange of ideas in a field of inquiry and is thus considered influential. 
Several objective measures of journal influence based on citation counts are available, such as the volume of citations received, the number of citations received per average article published, and the ratio of citations received to citations made (Doreian 1988)1. Representative studies in marketing using this approach are Leong (1989)2, Pieters and colleagues (1999)3, and Zinkhan, Roth, and Saxton (1992)4. 
Review of Literature
Citation-based methods of assessing journal influence also have several limitations  Brown and Gardner (1985)5. One important issue is that articles may be cited for a variety of reasons, not all of which reflect a transfer of knowledge or true acknowledgment of intellectual indebtedness. Although it is usually assumed that citing others ‘work signifies that the cited document served as a relevant source of information, other motives are possible. Small (1982)6 reviews seven studies that examine the functions that citation serve on the basis of an analysis of the context in which they appear. Although the schemes to classify the functions of citations vary, they usually contain functions such as use/application, affirmation/support, review, perfunctory mention, and negation. The various functions of references reflect the differential influence of the cited document, and some references, for example, perfunctory mention (Kotler 1972)7, may not be good indicators of influence. Perfunctory mentions were found to account for, on average, 20% to 60% of references. Related to this, authors may cite an article without using it, for example, when a cited source has not been consulted or is irrelevant to the argument (Wertsch 1995)8. In addition, authors may cite articles for strategic reasons, for example, because the authors of the cited articles are potential reviewers of the research (Tellis, Chandy, and Ackerman 1999)9. To the extent that these mechanisms affect the journals in a discipline similarly, they lower the validity and reliability of citation-based measures of journal influence. The scientometric studies of Narendra Kumar10 Amsaveni11, and Sadik Batcha12 corroborate with the citation analysis and they imply with the impact on recent researches.
Citation analysis is a major bibliometric approach (Osareh, 1996)13 originating from information sciences. Although still relatively new, bibliometric analysis has also found some advocates in the area of entrepreneurship (Etemad & Lee, 2003)14. Bibliometric analysis is founded on the assertion that citations can be used as indicators of present and past activities of scientiﬁc work (Garﬁeld, 1983)15 (Garﬁeld, Sher, & Torpie, 1964)16. Citation analysis has covered macro and micro studies. Macro studies are interested in the overall structure of disciplines and the laws that govern the evolution of science. Micro studies usually describe the structure and development of individual disciplines or schools of research and their interdependencies (Gmur, 2003)17. 
Dengue Disease/Fever
Dengue is a mosquito-borne viral disease that has rapidly spread in all regions of WHO in recent years. Severe dengue (also known as Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever) was first recognized in the 1950s during dengue epidemics in the Philippines and Thailand. Today, severe dengue affects most Asian and Latin American countries and has become a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children and adults in these regions. The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades. The actual numbers of dengue cases are underreported and many cases are misclassified. One recent estimate indicates 390 million dengue infections per year (95% credible interval 284–528 million), of which 96 million (67–136 million) manifest clinically (with any severity of disease).18 Another study, of the prevalence of dengue, estimates that 3.9 billion people, in 128 countries, are at risk of infection with dengue viruses.
Methodology
The present study belongs to the micro-oriented stream of research.  The data for this study was collected from WOS (Web of Science Data Base) for recent eight Years periods, 2010 to 2017 (till October 2017). The data was downloaded on 05-11-2017.  The searches were performed on the names of Dengue Disease and Dengue fever with all probabilities and bibliographical details of 6,031 research papers collectively contributed by 22,234 scientists published in 6007 scientific periodicals were collected taken for citation analysis. 

Data Analysis
To understand trends in Dengue research, Web of Science was used to retrieve citation data, which indexes 6007 journals in medical disciplines, adding approximately 40,000 new cited references per week. We initially searched for all articles with words beginning with “Dengue*” in their abstract, title, or keywords from the web of Science collection during the 2010 to 2017 period. This resulted in an initial data set of 6031 articles with over 1,01,100 cited references. The Year wise growth of literature is presented in table 1. The first 25 citation articles are presented in the table in year wise.  The prolific authors in the field of Dengue research are presented in Table 2 with their publication count. The scientists who have been the source of information chain in the field of dengue are measured with ‘h’ index in Table 3. The Price index is calculated on the citations and found the currency of the dengue literature in Table 4. The publications to which the dengue scientists cited and brought out new ideas are measured with citation study in Table 5. 
Discussion and Result
The table 1 explains the data on the research publication output given by the global scientists on Dengue fever in the recent years from 2010 to 2017. The growth rate from 2010 is found increasing year by year. The year 2017 consists of data up to the month of October yet the growth trend is noted high.  The years 2010 and 2011 show stagnate growth. The trend of publication growth is observed minimum of one 1.5% increase year by year. Recent years the attention towards Dengue fever seems to be high Hence the increase in the publications from 2016 is noted dual fold. The mortality rate due to dengue fever is high in the developing countries in recent years in particular in India. So the trend analysis supports the fact.

Table 2 presents the prolific Scientists who have contributed more number of research publications in the field of Dengue diseases. The first rank prolific scientist Harris E is from India has given 64 research output gradually in all the years of Study.  The majority of scientists are observed from USA in next proceeding ranks. Two scientists from USA and one from UK have given more than 50 research output. From the country Pakistan one scientist has contributed around 40 research publications. Overall table gives a clear picture that USA and UK Scientists are in a leading level in producing more number of Research output in the Dengue Diseases. Among them four Indian scientists are noted on the race trend.

The h-index is an author-level metric that attempts to measure both the productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar. The index is based on the set of the scientist's most cited papers and the number of citations that they have received in other publications. The index can also be applied to the productivity and impact of a scholarly journal as well as a group of scientists, such as a department or university or country.  The index was suggested in 2005 by Jorge E. Hirsch, a physicist at UCSD, as a tool for determining theoretical physicists' relative quality and is sometimes called the Hirsch index or Hirsch number.
A scholar with an index of h has published h papers each of which has been cited in other papers at least h times.  Thus, the h-index reflects both the number of publications and the number of citations per publication. The index is designed to improve upon simpler measures such as the total number of citations or publications. The index works properly only for comparing scientists working in the same field; citation conventions differ widely among different fields.
If we have the function f ordered in decreasing order from the largest value to the lowest one, we can compute the h index as follows:

h-index (f) = maxi min(f(i),i)

for Example  f(A)=10, f(B)=8, f(C)=5, f(D)=4, f(E)=3　→ h-index=4
           
 of  which                        f = Author
                                                       A = Article 1
Table 3 represents the ranking of 25 top scored scientists according to their h-index calculation. The top h-index in the table starts with 9. It is an interesting thing to note that the top 35 prolific scientists who have contributed more number of publications i.e. up to 24 in table 2 are not found securing top 25  h-index position. Mr.Shah PS, the scientists from UK has been ranked first with 9 h-index score whose 17 publications have been cited by 218 followers. There are about 4 scientists fall in the second h-index rank with the score of 8. At the third rank comes 2 scientists, at fourth rank falls 4 scientists, at fifth rank finds 11 scientists and in sixth rank comes 3 scientists. More than 200 citations are achieved by 5 scientists and between 100 and 200 citations are obtained by 6 scientists. The Indian scientists by name and birth are found achieving high h-index but their credits are highly going to UK and USA as they are found working in the research institutes of UK and USA.

Price, in his classic article(1970), defines the so called “Price Index” as “ the proportion of the references that are to the last five years of Literature”. It is hereby unimportant whether or not we use the references of one article, the references of all the articles in all the journals in a certain discipline.
Glanzel and Schoepflin (1995) deal with the Price Index as the portion of references that are not older than 2 years. Therefore we can define more generally the Price Index(PId) as the fraction of references that are 0,1,2,… d years old. In Glanzel and Schoepflin(1995). A graph of PI2 (X100) versus the mean reference age is produced.  
Price Index – the fraction of references published within five years of the article publication year:
                                               PI = N ≤ 5/ Nall 
Table -4 Citation Analysis of Dengue Research publication with Price Index Calculation

The considerable numbers of references have been cited by the dengue scientists. It was calculated more than 18,000. The citation analysis according to Price index clearly pictures that publications contributed by the scientists are highly referred and cited the journals that were published more than 5 years time period. It is accounted more than 50 percentages in almost all the years of study. 
Table 5 lists the top 25 journals that have been cited by the Dengue scientists for their 6013 publications. The list supports the price Index that more than 5 years publications have made an impact in keeping the information chain in to recent period. The Nature Journal has received 1948 citations ranks to be top and finds authored by an Indian author. There are 18 journals which have been secured between 200 to 685 citations. The other 6 journals among 25 ranks have got between 100 and 200 Journals.

Conclusion
Macro studies are interested in the overall structure of disciplines and the laws that govern the evolution of science. Micro studies usually describe the structure and development of individual disciplines or schools of research and their interdependencies. Due to increasing Dengue fever casualties reported in recent years, The Dengue research publication is found in growing trend. The prolific scientists with appreciable publication counts at global level are observed in the study. More over the role of Scientists from India in the field of Dengue research is to be adored. Mr.Harris is noted to be top among the prolific authors in the field. The highest h-index secured by the scientists engaged in Dengue research is about 9. The scientists with more number of publications are not found recording the highest h-index score. The quality publications are contributed from UK and India. In addition, the Indian Scientists working in other nations have been in the top list of h-index. The price Index lights on the fact that more than 50 percentages of current scientists cite the journal publications published 5 years back.  These sources seem to be roots of Dengue Information tree. The publication given by Bhatt in Nature journal has been highly cited at about 1950 times. It shows its quality and strength among other publications. At the outset the role of Indian Scientists are exemplary in the field of Dengue fever.
